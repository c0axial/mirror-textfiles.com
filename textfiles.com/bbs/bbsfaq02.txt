INTRODUCTION
=============
DLX has been sold commercially for years, it is now available as
freeware/public domain program.
 
DLX runs on MS-DOS and supports up to 32 telephone lines at once on a
single computer.  It is a social BBS.  On a social BBS, the main
activity (in addition to file uploading and downloading), is
interacting with other callers by chatting or exchanging email. DLX
supports two kinds of email, public and private, and two kinds of
chatting, one-on-one chatting and Open Forum (group chat), plus
questionaires and a matchmaker.

A note from the author of DLX:
===============================
The complete source code for DLX in the zip file.  DLX is written in
Microsoft Pascal and MASM. Nothing would please me more than to have
some kid in his bedroom write the next great social BBS. You are free
to use this source code for any purpose.  You may modify it and make
your own BBS program, and even copyright and sell your modified
version.

Happy BBSing!

INTRODUCTION
==============
EIS is a complete remote information manager. A remote information
manager is a program that allows people who own modems to call your 
modem and download information, send, receive, and reply to E-Mail.
Operate programs that run on your computer from theirs, view catalogs,
place orders, talk to the system operator (ie: You), and more.

While EIS offers all these services to the people who call your modem,
you have complete control over who has access to what parts of your
system.  You can control access to specific message bases, menus,
commands, file directories, and even individual files. If you wish,
you can configure the system so only the people that you have already
assigned passwords to will be able to access the system at all.

Where Can I download EIS?
=========================
EIS is currently available on America Online as EISBBS.ZIP.

This is a Falken Directory automator. If you have a directory that
you want to make a DLOADADD file for, just run Falfile on this
directory and it creates a DLOADADD readable text file.  It automates

Another option is the ability to logoff a user on specific lines after
displaying a text file for certain levels.  Sometimes non-paying
members need to be limited to certain lines.  Recently updated to
support special "@" commands for internal user/account/system 
information (ie. @address to display the user's address).

8. WWiV DOOR LOADER

to other boards or for linking another BBS to Falken with a NULL modem
cable.  New in version 2.0, added DialHOST and DialMENU which
seamlessly transfers DOOR.SYS and CHAIN.TXT files thru the NULL modem
cable using XMODEM CRC, the user then is brought to a menu which
selects doors.  DialMENU uses the FOSSIL and is compatible with SIO
and X00.  In console mode the sysop may link Western TLCF, Falken
TLCF, download XMODEM, YMODEM, ZMODEM and upload ZMODEM, XMODEM and
much more. This is menu based and even checks for BUSY signals.
Recently updated for Falken V6.65. 
 
11. BIRTHDAY DOOR
This door automatically generates a monthly birthday text file which
can be viewed at logon or in a menu.  This door also notifies who's
birthday is today and congratulates them.  This door also acts as a
Backgammon and Chess move logon checker, and can operate in stealth
(hidden) mode.


12. WESTERN TELECONFERENCE
Replaces or adds another Falken Tlcf. A developers kit is available to
program doors for Western. Scavenger hunt and High-Low Game are 
included as Western doors.  Allows actions to be customized,
RIPscript, and features the best linking EVER!  Links support .netwho
(see who is on the other systems), .netpage to page users on other 
BBS's, network aware actions and private whispers through the net and
much more! A special .kiss action has randomn 5 customized displays.

Western TLCFs on your one BBS for free.  PS #13 was recently upgraded
to run as a Western Door (freeing up memory).
 
14. CERTIFICATE AUTO-CREDITS
This program allows you to generate a 12 character certificate, sell
or give the certificate to customers and they enter the number inside
Falken to auto-upgrade their account.  You set the options that the
program upgrades them with.  This program also includes a label 
printer/maker and 500 entry randomn certificate generator for those
without a printer.
 
15. 900 DOOR/AUTO CREDITS
This door is a logon door. You set what line is your 976 or 900 number,
then when someone calls that number and logs on successfully it
automatically gives them a set number of credits and hangs up on them.
Has two new modes of auto-crediting. The first is the option to give
some credits to all users once per day, and the seconds is the option
to only give credits to people who have zero credits.

16. ACCOUNT UTILITY (transfer credits)
This door on credit based systems allows users to transfer credits to
users online/ or offline. It will email users with a note if they are
offline.  A minimum amount of credits is an option to disallow free
credits transfer.

the subject message base and message number.
 
18. MORE MENUS
Allows you to replace GFILES and have a way to display text messages.

USA Today, Top Ten lists, and help files. Now you may run regular
Falken doors through more menus and have unlimited Falken menus!
 
19. ZMODEM SEND (with CD ROM support)
This door is a zmodem send replacement for Falken. It copies CD ROM
files to disk before transferring to speed up multiple CD access.

file.  This text file can then be uploaded for support personnel or
printed out for reference purposes.  "Switch" also allows you to
switch Falken menu entries.
 
22. ACCOUNT RENAMER (fneta)
This program renames a directory full of similar filenames (those
beginning with account number) easily.  For example, some 3rd party
doors uses account numbers filenames to keep track of user options. 
On my system they begin with "tmw" and when when switching to "col"
I ran this program as  "> fneta tmw col".

This is a multi-BBS wall for FALKENET V3.01.  FALKENET (product of
Mark Manes and Duane Waddle) is a "Fidonet similar" net email, message
