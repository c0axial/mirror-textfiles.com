IMIDIATLY the person who i first called then dials back AUTOMATICKLY and
we start when i hung up on... Do ya know what i mean?
I dial the number firstly using TONES on my fone, when i get an answer i
switch to PULSES and get another dial tone, then i hang up, and the other
end that i first dialed calls me back!!!!! It's shit hot! Dunno who the
fuck pays for the call once I get called tho, somebody else try it out and
tell me what it is, coz i aint gotta clue... Also, when u get the second
dial tone u cannot dial another number out of it, after pressing a few
numbers a message comes up saying 'Sorry u have dialed incorectly, u will
be re-connected to the otherline' .... well WIERD! anybody know what it
is?

Blackthorn, it isn't just a 'phreaking' meet. The UK 2600 meetings are
held on the first Friday of each month at the Trocadero Shopping Center,
Picadilly Circus, London. Assemble next to the VR machines on the bottom
floor between 7pm and 8pm.

yeah basically,
your exchange has gone digital, you have not paid for the system X
facilities and so when you RECALL (or pulse a 1, same thing) you get your
second line to call a third party but of course it won't let ya do shit
because you aint paid BT the cash, i would highly believe that you are
still getting charged foir the call because when it rings back it is just
reminding you that you still have the other caller on the line2 sort of
thing, don't worry about it, its quite normal.

  From: AC Assassin [15]
  Time: Sat May 28 00:14:58 1994
Don;t know if any of u watch MTV much but the last couple of weeks they
have shown a news at night edition about hacking, etc. They interviewed
people from Hacktic (Felipe Rodriquez springs to mind), they showed the
film of them hacking the american military stuff a few years ago to get
the patriot missile system plans during the gulf war.
The interview went on to talk about blueboxing, they gave a reasonable
description and they panned across a blue print for a blue box design,
they covered the whole plan at reasonable magnification (possible to build
one by taping it), and they said in so many words "don't try this at home
kids" because 2 people were jailed last year in britain for boxing (they
showed the newspaper headline, something like 2 jailed for joyriding or
something. Anyway just thought i'd let you know.

O.K. here it goes,
What you need is a very nice person with 3 - way calling on their
phone.  You get them to set up a three way call with you and any U.S.
number you require.  When all three are connected, the very nice person
with 3 - way calling hangs up!!!!  Do you get this so far???  And then
no-one is being charged for the call!!
Easy as Converting Base 4 numbers to Base 13!!

  Time: Wed May 25 05:30:31 1994
   Hmm well I have completed the scan upto 500, no luck so far..
  Blackthorn:  We're looking for the routing codes to the states, not back
to britain m8; I only want that cause all my internet dialups are in the
states, if I could figure out a reliable method of boxing to another
country I would dig out some dialups there...
  I was using the 890679 (fiji) dialup the other day, it has definitely
died now, not only that but the sounds it makes on sieze has changed to
the same as the other lines, and the message it gives when u route a call
wrong has changed from some shitty answering machine to the standard
'....COUNTRY YOU WERE CALLING HAS BEEN CHANGED...' one..weird..seems to me
that BT is intent on killing BB'ing and is rushing to close all the
loopholes perhaps ?

Well, there seems to be divided opinions on why the codes have changed -
is it do to with phoneday (?) or a crackdown against blue boxers? Anyway,
like I said, would it reveal anything by asking the international operator
on 155 (BT op that is) or would that just arouse suspicions?

george king/sjc: it aint the phoneday thingy at all, Bt stopped it coz to
many poeople were boxing to the Uk, that is why it died, they have been
changing data and blocking out codes (as A BT bloke explained) so it is
unlikly you will be able to box at all from the old numbers

 Title: Organise
  From: Gilby [72]
  Time: Sat May 28 00:46:05 1994
Everyone :
 I have spoken to someone pretty senior within the BT establishment and
they confirmed that a software change and/or some sort of filter was
placed on the lines to stop boxing. The reason, he told me, was that after
the channel 4 program the instances of blueboxers skyrocketed and they
felt that it had to be stopped.
 However, he is getting some engineers to find some other routs for me to
use. I gave him some info about what freqs. and dial patterns we could
dial and he suggested russia would be a good place to use. Whatever
happens, it can't be bad - some BT engineers working on a way round boxing
for me. Basically they know everything about all these countries phone
exchanges, so it shouldn't take that long. I am only here weekend tho.
Keep you posted. BTW Can anyone supply me with some calling cards ....
mail me please !!!!! Thanks Gilby

Scribla,

if you want to know about the phones, just go into a service provider shop
type thing and say, "someone has offered me a phone, could you verify
whetehr it is registered as missing/stolen, whatever before i buy it".
Give em whatever details you have and the will give you an opinion, they
have some national register.

dont know about this but I recently read a file about using
varnish or other hard substances applied to fone kards to stop
them being punched and using up the credits ,never seen a reply
though apparently the varnish was not strong enough to withstand
the physical force and it was unknown if an electro magnetic field also
zapped them rendering the idea useless. it would be interesting
to find a way to make these cards last longer. looking at the
japanese ones which are very thin and are invalidated by being
punched with a hole it cant be any harder.I wondered if tippex would
work on cards if they were based on some sort of optical device.

when yer fone card is nearly running out, do this:
Get some BLANK video film, tape it over the magnetic strip on the card,
draw over it lightly wiv a 2B pencil, remove the tape, and bobs yer
uncle... Dunno if it still works tho..

Can anyone suggest a source of 'guarana bubble gum' aka 'buzz gum'? This
is just a legal bubble gum which contains guarana and can be bought is a
few dodgy shops throughout the U.K. The packs I have seen contain '12'
pieces of gum and are packaged in a red, white and green box. Any
telephone numbers and contact addresses would be appreciated. Anybody
actually tried this stuff?

Right here's just a few quick questions...
a) what punishment can you get if you're nicked for carding...
b) how likely is it you'll get nicked/prosecuted when ordering goods to an
address
c) can the person who gets his card used claim money back off the card
company (like theft insurance)

Thanks

Harlequin : I get my cards from a mate in a restaaaunt anmd he says even
if they think a crad is stolen they allow spending up to 25 quid if that
makes sense about the ppl getting money back.  Think thats as much as can
be claimed maybe ??...afater that amount a shop maybe has to repay or
maybe cant even claim it :)  He even had a asian guy come ion with a LAdy
some ones gold card :)

The Hayes Optima 28.8k modem should arrive tomorrow. I will do my best to
get everything configured and running upto 14.4k before the weekend.

Due to the fact that my serial port will not support 28.8k, this system
will probably be running on a 386/486 before the end of 1994.
