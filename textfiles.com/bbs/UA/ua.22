Should I upgrade to Ami-Express v3.37 when the Hayes Optima 28.8k is
installed? I also plan on purchasing a Supra 28MHz accelerator card in

886+8+acn+st, BUT you say the 44 code for the UK isn't part of what you
dial???  Are you just bullshitting to throw us off the scent??  AND how
come you said kp isn't used, but Znote said it is? Hmmmm.

Since its an internal routing code u dont need 44, KP2 IS used.
Its a digital ISDN network which will come into force after phoneday
(thats the current thought) ... Lines are better than when paying for it
... I am calling here now using it ...

Hello Mr. Phantasm,
   If you want a *VERY* good bbs package supporting the new VFAST
standards then C-NEt (v2.35 is very good for a 500) and supports all
speeds to 192oo. I have the wb2+ version which will support the new
28.8k but you will need an A1200 because the A500 serial port can only
xfer data at 31840 which is not a valid standard!!

Sorry I haven't been back but a couple of things threw me. 1./ I work

log on but but i've just found out you don't go on line 'til 2200hrs. This
is difficult for me 'cos I'm normally in thepub from 2100hrs, and can't be
arsed after that. I'm going to log off now but will be back after my next
tour, in 2 weeks, hope you'll have me. I'm sorting out some stuff to
upload .  I'm really interested, as I've siad, in other systems and I reall
would like to know the basics of cracking game codes

To my  mind, if you can break the line, then with the appropriate routing
coeds, you can dail wherever.. just a question of cracking the little

Anyone noticed that all lines which became un-seizable last month can now
be siezed again? Isn't this a little weird? Also, how long has it been
possible to blue box back to the U.K. Most people seem to have only found
out about this during the last couple of months.

Hmm...I don't know about the method that u are using Blackthorn....Ihave
managed to box back to the UK using international ops by way of :
KP2-XX-Y-ZZZZZZZZZ-ST where XX is the country code and Y is the
Identification (I think), Anyway the country code for the UK is not 44 as
you might think - I won't tell the number used , as said before, it is
more of an acheivement to work it out yerself. It seems to work on all
numbers I have tried so far....

BTW. As Phantasm pointed out...the exchanges that became unseizeable have
now become siezeable onmce more....Hmmm, is there something to to worry
about by boxing on the se numbers or not? Who makes the loss out of
phreaking? BT or the remote telco? Has anyone got any idea as to how BT
wopuld detect us boxers?

I am visiting a friend on Friday to start work on a portable blue box
unit. The circuit is from an old issue of TAP (classic 1970s phone phreak
newsletter) and is built around two 555 timers. The only frequencies which
need to be added are 2600/2400Hz and 2400/2400Hz. We hope to use a normal
phone keypad with * producing 2400/2600, 2400/2400Hz and # producing the
tones for Key Pulse 2. The guy who we are meeting is supposed to be an
electronics wizard, so lets hope it's true!

I always thought that the tones required had to be sinusoidal.  The good
old 555 generates a square wave.  I suppose it could sound pretty similar
though.  I have some electronics experience so if I can help just shout.
I wondered about using one of these Casio FX730 computers to drive some
hardware to produce a handheld box.  Does anybody know whet the pin outs
are on the rear.  Anyway just a thought ......

Here are some tones I've been given for breaking BT lines...
I must say they are un-confirmed and were left for me anonymously. I
haven't had much time to play with them, but I got a bleep after the first
tone a couple of times... Also, I've been told that this is highly risky
as stuff like this can be traced within a few seconds with System Y.
Anyway, here's the info exactly as I got it...

2280hz 1000ms
bleep
2280hz 80ms

book a conference in advance and get this --- have your conference

As regards BT making money on blue boxers, I was given to understand that
the foreign countries involved paid a flat rate for their line..that would
mean that NO-ONE made money out of it (or lost it either, for that
matter..) however, it seems obvious to me that they know (and have always
known) who is bbing, they just don't seem to want to prosecute for some
reason.  Perhaps it's to avoid publicity, or maybe it's a 'better the
devil you know' type situation, i.e. they can keep an eye on the guys who
are bbing rather than have someone invent a new method of phreaking that
they CAN'T keep an eye on..this would also mean that if someone released
the next internet worm, theycould go round and arrest him immediately...

  Then again, maybe that's all complete crap :) - jus speculating

  So what IS the score with BBing at the moment then?  The lines are still
seizable..from what i can gather on here BT have just 'changed the routing
codes'...is this DEFINITELY a measure to try & get rid of blue boxers?
Surely the would just have made the lines un-seizable?  If they have just
changed the codes, is it a good idea to try and scan them out again, or
can we expect a knock at the door for our troubles?  Does anyone have any
info on the possible length/format of the new routing codes?

   Can I suggest that if people are going to try and scan out the new
codes, we organise some sort of scan on here...a division of labour would
be a good idea so we can all get back to our 'hobby' asap.  Also, if only
one or two people have the new codes & start to BB, they are going to
stick out like a sore thumb..safety in numbers and all that..what do you
lot think?

Well I agree with Georges message.  We should organise our scanning
efforts.  To set the ball rolling I have found the following.
KP2 118 081 390 1244C       The 81 390 1244 bit is CIX
this gives the engaged tone
KP2 128 081 390 1244C     We are sorry your call can not be connected
also KP2 xxx where xxx is 138 148 158 198 give some results.
Can anybody improve on this.  Can anybode guess the new code format.
Blue boxing is not dead, we just need to sort the latest problem.  If we
can break the lines we are 50% of the way there. So lets get to it!!!!

Right .. Here Here !! I think that there must be a way to rout a call
through to the US ... I found out that if you dial +10176xxxxxx where
xxxxx is anything at all you get an american ring and a number
unobtainable message. Also, you can call hawaii with +10808xxxxxxx ...
not too interesting you might think but if you call a number and actually
connect (ie.8089236333) you can seizi the line again with KP. I have not
managed to get it to dial out, but I also managed to find one number in
the 808 area which will give the connecting "beep" and then a message
saying this number is not on the dial list or someting (Sorry, i forgot
the number). Then you don't have to piss people off waiting for them to
answer their phones before you can seize and try and dial out.
Keep trying everybody ! Eventually we will crack it ... L8tr

 ok as to the new routing codes this is what i have found..
 B1X176+       Bahamas
 B1X808+       hawaii
 B57X809+      Columbia
 B56X994+      Chile
 B62X178+      Philipines
 B886X133+     Taiwan
 B592X770+     Bolivia
 B27X119+      S.Africa

 interestingly the Taiwan and philipines routing can be used on
0500-890066 , on that # any other stuff gives me a recorded mesage
'this is mercury international...' .. weird..

oh and if you dont mind engineering operators a little its still easy
enough to call anywhere on the old BB.. all you have to do is find the
right operators heh..

a good method of discovering valid meridian VMB accs is using the Express
service that usually goes hand in hand with Meridian VMBs.
it seems that within the VMB tel. no. range there is a service which
alows you to send msgs without all the menu shit.
after the 'Express mail...mailbox?' prompt just start entering numbers
(with following #) to find valid boxes....
hmmm...might be usefull....

* * * BLUE BOXING TO THE "USA" AND "UK" IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE * * *

I guess most UABBS users will have discovered that the routing codes for
the USA and UK will no longer route you through the network. From what I
have been told by various phreaks around the country, routing calls to the
USA became impossible around 9.00am today, while calling back to the UK was
still possible until around 12.00am.

If anyone finds the new routing codes before we do, share your knowlege. I
myself have been blue boxing without a single problem for the last 4 years
and todays events have come as quite a shock.
