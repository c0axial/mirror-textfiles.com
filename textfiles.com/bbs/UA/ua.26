Matty,
you asked for a credit card check merchant #, etc, give this one a try :
0702 352222
merchant number : 543457040520322
I have some others somewhere but i can't find them at the moment, this one
may still work, i got it from a newsagent type shop thing but i have a
feeling that the merchant codes have been changed to ones much smaller,
I'll try and find the Lloyds one, it is an 0345 ------ and i know it works
for sure.

'SCANNER.PAS' and is #4 in the new uploads.
Hope itr is of some use.

No I don't get the clue.  If B.T. wanted to stop boxing then it wouldn't
be too difficult would it.  If you have something constructive to say then
please say it.  Anyway we all know B.T. are aware of boxing but we all
still do it.( or did <g>).  The country codes have not changed but it
seems that the routing codes have.......  I am sure that B.T know that
just changing routing codes will not stop us finding them.  So it seems
sensible that the routing codes have changed for another reason i.e. phone
day.  ZNote do you have a logical explanation for your comments or are you
just being a wank ..........

If ya want to renew your phonecards just pick up some used ones from the
floor in the telephone boxes, get a real fuckin sharp cutting implement
and cut out the strip in the top 1/3 of the card where the marks are made
(you need only cut out an area about 8mm in height and about 4CM long
(depending on the unit size of the card, i.e. the more units the more
cutting you will have to do). Then take one of your other used cards and
cut out an identical sized strip from the opposite end of the card (i.e.
the opposite end to where the units are marked off) and glue it into your
card. This is a bit time consuming but can be well worth your while with
large capacity cards.
N.B. the tolerances of the card slot in the phone are very small, you
could used to get by with sellotape on 1 side but the slots seem to have
been narrowed and hence doing that will simply getting it jammed up. So
best use some superglue or something.

News Update: Tuesday 24-May-94 21:01:45

The Hayes Optima 28.8k modem should arrive any day now. I will do my best
to get everything configured and running upto 14.4k as soon as possible.

Due to the fact that my serial port will not support 28.8k, this system
will probably be running on a 386/486 before the end of 1994.

Sorry for the delay, Phantasm (SysOp)

As the smoke clears from the battlefield, it appears that the enemy
has gained a major victory. Scores of people raided, many arrested, some
in jail, bulletin boards seized, the casualties are many. Today it is
almost impossible to find any hack/phreak board, let alone a decent one.

Everyone is laying low, information is scarce. When asked almost everyone
is "retired". Our world is on hold, and has been on hold for what seems
like an eternity. The Phrack trials, Operation Sun Devil, and a dozen
other events have struck a major blow against our way of life, and
caused paralysis. Just like in the real world, the hack/phreak world is
experiencing a recession of its own.
