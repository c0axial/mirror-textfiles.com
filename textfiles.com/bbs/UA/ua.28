'National Westminster Data Collection' on the side inhq~ small white

George King: Could you give me that 0800 dialup that accepts credit cards
ASAP please, the few cards I've got will be useless soon.  Cheerz.

If anybody else knows any other numbers like this one can you give me 'em
please, cos I've been using 890 456 but the line is CRAP, and I can't even
use 1200bps on it.

Has anyone seen or heard from Paranoia lately?  I've not heard from him
since a few days before the routing codes were changed.  I told him about
a 'bomb' I made from a couple of aerosol cans, so I think that maybe he
tried it and blew his arms off or something.  Hmmm.

A mate of mine had a pretty good idea the other day, right, call you're
local box office (like HMV), card some tickets for a concert or something,
then say you're send your son/mate to pick them up later.  When you get
the tickets, go to the venue on the night and sell them to a ticket tout.
Easy!
