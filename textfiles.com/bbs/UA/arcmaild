 I've managed to locate quite a nice free BBS.
 Dial 0800891455,wait for it to be picked up then go to another
telephone 
extension and press 1. You will then have complete access to the
Advanced 
Micro Devices buletin board,all you have to do is give a false company
name.
 You have a 3 hour time limit with as many downloads as you like 24
hours 
a day.

you could always try putting ,,,,,,,,1 after the number on your
software.
I'm on that system as MARTIN ROGERS, so if you want to leave mail...
the sysop left me some post, saying he was thinking of putting in
INTERNET access, which would be kinda neat.

I've never had anyone on the other line.  And I'm not sure that if
there was that youd be able to open the door, or whatever. I'm willing
to try tho, if you post a time I'll phone them and we can see.

if you dial 0800 899825 you get a telnet (?) system.
try things like CONNECT RESAC1 or CONNECT 192.0.0.5
but i can't get much further.  SHOW NODES or SHOW SERVER is quite good.

I couldnt get any of those UK routing codes to werk. I asked about US
Direct,
credit card calls etc. but was told "Gyana does not have this feature."
I was
also told that Gyana has no international prefix so for  international
call
you must go through the 002 operator. The first time I called and told
em I was
calling from Gorage Town and they believed me! hehehe :-) Last time she
just
kept asking "What country are you dialling from?" and didnt believe
that I was
calling from Gyana...
Has anybody managed to get a good modem connection to
kp2-5920279313/333? I keep
getting no carrier within a few secs. Tried ATS10=255 but I think its
their
modem thats disconnecting.
That kp2-592-0279-414 chatline can also be reached on kp2-592-11010.
This is the
same number that they repeat 'cept with a 1 before it. Yeah, and all of
the
operator numbers are for the same operator! The number
kp2-592-y-xxxx-st is
t itsike.  it ia 8 diit number then any number wl wk for y.
Praps the y is supposed ttell em where we're calling from? Who
knows?...

I hope this isn't all dreadfully old hat, but here y'are...

Small 0800 713 Scan:

713 000 VMB

713 001->003 Coca Cola VMB system

713 004 big click, dead for c.15 secs, then tone

713 005->008 nothing

713 009 Coca-Cola again

713 010 VMB

713 011 Steve Milligan VMB

713 012 Tony Mears VMB

713 013 nothing

713 014 Eddie Renshaw VMB

713 015->017 nothing

713 018 VMB

713 019 nothing

713 020 Some Kacko-Cola Exec's VMB

713 021 VMB

713 022->026 nothing

713 027 VMB

713 028 VMB

713 029->032 nothing

713 033 VMB

713 034 VMB

713 035 VMB

713 036 VMB

713 037 VMB says to try Milton Keynes 0908 210 828 2201.

713 038 & 039 Coca-Cola voice mail system

As you can see, thick with VMBs. I think they all belong
to Coca-Cola, so if you prefer Pepsi, you could try messing
with these.

PS - Can anyone tell me anything about VMB abuse? Its not an area that
seems very well documented.

scanning or suchlike,i've just done a quick proggie on my ST to speed

899 400 used to go to columbia and was boxable.. and at one point
global.. 899 401 is also columbia but is not breakable with the same
frequencies!?!? hmm.. the PBX's I would expect would have been abused
already as many people have scanned 899 before.. but they might be
worth a try..

The Colimban lines (400/1/2/3) will break with a looooooong 2600
(2secs+) and a short 2400 with a tiny dealy inbetween, but don't dial
shit, not even terminal or inward ops. werid, there is a lot of
exchanges that now do this that used to disl global or at least
terminal (Iceland, Colomiba, Peru,China to name but a few) Ccitt-5Bis?
