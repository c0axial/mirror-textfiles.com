ading and a beting criminal activities<g> anyway i still stick to my
theory that most off the shit we do ....to get nicked fer it u goto get

What? Which law journal did you extract that particular piece of
bullshit from? There are far too many ways they could charge me to list
here, but suffice to say that even having the password file from a unix
system online (whether I put it there or not) is technically enough
reason to charge me with an offence under the computer misuse act.

I've not been charged with anything, don't listen to sad rumours.
I have had no contact with the police since mid-Sept. when I went for
an interview with fife c.i.d.
That's about it, I just thought I'd let you know for those of you that

    ----------------------------------------------------
 
    Well I have been off the scene for awhile and
    just decided to give UA a call. I could not help
    but notice that there is alot of confusion going
    on about Bulletin Board Busts and worried sysops.
 
    Well on the 27th January 1993 at 7:00am another
    underground BBS (known as The Second Ring) was
     ited bScotland Yard Computer and Obscene
    Crimes Units and Park Lane C.I.D. (Leciestershire
    Police). They turned up with a search warrent and
    the following equipment was siezed (as read off
    the endorsement attached to te seah warrent)
 
        o Amiga 500 Computer
        o SupraFax Modem
        o Supra 105MB Hard Drive
        o External Disk Drive
      o Joystick
        o Mouse
        o Power Supply
        o Modulater
        o 255 Floppy Discs
        o 2 Folders
        o 3 Diaries
 
    The arresting officers were Sgt. John Fredrick Ashley
    (Rank, No. and police devision - SEARGENT X 4431 X03(2)
    G.M.P.) of Scotland Yard Obscene Crimes Unit and DC. Paul
    Andrews of Park Lane C.I.D.
 
    The sysop was charged with Conspriacy to Contravene
    Section 3 of Computer misuse Act 1990.
 
    The bust was a result of a tip-off from Apache Warrior
    (manager of a group known as Association of Really Cruel
    Viruses) -- The system operator of TSR was suspected to
    be a member of ARCV, which was untrue. On the 4th April
    1993 the operator was interviewed, police never actually
    gained access to the hard drive but did have evidence
    against him (folders containing prinouts of documents 
    downloaded from Bulletin Boards, diaries, and a capture
    taken from the ARCV BBS suggesting hacking activies by
    the operator.
 
    The system operator received a caution under the
    Telecommunications Act 1984. On the 2nd February 1994
    the operator received all computer equipment back except
    the 105MB hard drive (which has probably gone to one of
    the officers kids for a christmas present :)).
 
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 
 
    During the interview it was made clear that ...
 
      Under the Obscene Communications Act and the
      Telecommunications Act 1984 it is an offence
      to publish an "obscene" article which means anything
      likely to "deprave and corrupt". This law was orignally
      introduced to cover obscene phone calls but can also be
      applied to transmitting obscene images, textfiles or
      whatever by modem over a public telephone line.
 
    As a result the operator got off with a caution due to him
    being a Juvenile (which was a good job anyway because his
    solicitor was f*cking useless!!!). 
 
                       - - - - - - - -
 
    If you require any more information on this subject then
    mail Asterix on here.
 
    P.S.
      The operator of the prevously menoned BBS has now quit
      thecene due to the mentioned events.

 Yeah, true enough. I did think of that, but since most underground
 boards keep a bbs list door themselves, i dont think there would be
 that much risk in releasing it on Hp Only Boards..

I am sorry about the time this system takes to .ZIP (or whatever)

new year and this will make archiving four times faster than it is now.
(not to mention better cps rates while transfering)
 
I'm still not able to use ANY 14.4k modem on this phone line. I plan on
giving BT the finger as soon as Diamond Cable begin installing lines
next year. (and yes, we will be online 24hrs at 14.4k or 28.8k)

hey phantasm,howz about a section on breaking and entry??
would be much appreciated..
Welll,ive not called here with one thing asnd another and all my
partying etc so ill post some things Ive learnt in the past month or
so..
firstly..a quick tip on lock picking...spray WD40 down the lock..this
makes locks so easy..or much easier at least...
hmm....its possible to open a lot of the cheaper padlocks by using an L
shaped bit of wire and puching down the tumblers and twisting...it
takes practice but is very quick once mastered..
erhhmm....3rdly.....school windows etc(the slide ones) are so fuckin
crap its hard to belive...
just push them upwards and they sort of "clunk" out of the bolts sop to
speak and can then be slid open....sometimes its better to get a large
screwdriver,put it between the window and the bottom of the
frame(between the two bits that slide) and twist the screwdriver to a
vertical position-pushes the window up..then get a friend to slide the
window...
 thats all I can think of for now...one or two more things I think..Ill
post on my next call...

Can someone please upload the latest version of PKLITE and any decent

twin 720k 3.5" floppies... and all for 50.00 pounds. It may be old
(1987), but it is ideal for running all those nice little MS-DOS
hack/phreak executables and mobile communications. I just hope it last

Also, check WH-Smiths for issue ONE of the following new comms

Last time I spoke to him he was getting backbilled for shitloads of

I have ordered a v2.04 kickstart ROM for the A2000. I have also ordered
a Video Back-Up system which will allow me to back-up my entire hard
drive onto VHS tape. (much cheaper than a tape drive at 58.00 pounds)
 
The new hard drive (IDE Alfa Data - 420mb or 540mb) will be ordered
next week and installed before Christmas.
 
I will purchase some extra RAM (2mb) and a 28Mhz Supra Turbo
accelerator card next month. (faster than a standard A4000)
 
If anyone has a cheap GVP I/O card for the A2000, please send email.

It would be nice if we could have meetings in London, Nottingham and

It is possible to capture some remote car alarm signels from the keyfob

be able to capture the signal onto your tv remote when they arm/disarm

WARNING: ANYONE WHO IS CALLING THIS BBS VIA AN 0800/0500 PBX/VMB.
 
I KNOW SOME OF OUR USERS ARE CALLING VIA THESE LINES AND I WOULD JUST
LIKE TO SAY THAT THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF ABC (THE COMPANY WHICH
OPERATES THE DDI SYSTEM WHICH THESE CALLS ARE ROUTED THROUGH) HAS
INFORMED ME THAT ALL CALLS ARE BEING MONITORED BY BT AND MERCURY.
 
THIS INCLUDES THE 0800/0500 LINES FOR BARCLAY CARD, VODAC, VAUHALL AND
MANY OTHER COMPANIES.
 
THESE LINES ARE BEING KEPT ACTIVE AT BT AND MERCURY'S REQUEST AND I
WOULD SUGGEST ANYONE USING THESE LINES TO TAKE THIS WARNING
VERY SERIOUSLY.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
If that were true then why would the managing director of the company
tell you that all of the lines are deliberately being kept open??
In fact, why would he contact you at all? If they were gonna bust 
everyone using the 0800/0500 numbers then they would keep quiet about
it - they wouldn't call up the sysop of a h/p bbs which is being
dialled thru their system and say "Hi this is abc blah blah blah...
will you tell everyone that bt and mercury are onto them and are gonna 
bust them soon." The first thing we'd hear would be that they had 
actually arrested someone... All of the lines are gonna be monitored
to a certain extent anyway. How did he inform you? What proof did he
give to show that he was who he claimed to be?

Hi!
Im usin Win for Workgroupz rite now (3.11), I dont know wot
restrictions will be on your network, but hopefully you will be able
to Select the [RUN] command from the file menu, this will allow you
to execute any dos application you desire. pref the DOS CLI, this
is just command.com , you should only need to enter [COMMAND] and this
should drop you into the shell, if it gives you shit about the path
then use file manager to look thru the HD too see if you can find its
exact location on the HD. I suspect that you might be using shared
resources , and will prob be quite restricted to wot partz of the
server disk u can xcess. 
BTW : if all else failz, get a floppy with command.com on it and do a 
[a: command] from the RUN option. I wuz workin wiv these thingz durin
da sumzerz , don ma nutt rite inn! If I can be of any help just yell.

Its quite normal for videos sat rx etc to radiate a watchable picture
for quite a few metres, theres no hard and fast rule, but it only werks
if they are using coax between the tv and the device, if they have
scart, you don't get any radiation of picture.

Just heard the sad news.....the feds finally caught up with Kevin

that the guy is brilliant! Surely it's about time this country bred a
few REAL HACKERS & PHREAKERS like that.....maybe we do but the H&P
community in this country keeps a real low profile and the guys that
are really breaking new ground are a minority that keep the good news
relatively quiet which is kind of a pity because a true hacker is one
that liberates the info that the dewdz in the ivory towers like to keep
hidden. Freedom of information is something that we should all strive
for. The system that we live in at the moment is really fucked up and
too much power is in the hands of those that abuse it purely for their
own ends. 
THE BANKS ARE A PRIME EXAMPLE OF THAT SO LET ME ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO

The new hard drive will be purchased on Friday afternoon. I had planned
to buy it this week, however I was a little short of cash. 
 
The price of the drive has actually dropped 10.00 pounds so they are
now only 109.00 pounds + VAT. If everything goes well, I hope to have
the board installed on the new machine before next Sunday.

anyway if you are interested in them they are yours. Can you read HD PC

Ac, I can read 720k PC disks and Atari ST disks if you can copy the

Alas it seems that once again Mr M Howard, bastard extra-ordinnaire is
putting his oar in in an endeavour to further censor and restrict
freedom of speech (and in this case code) in this fine country of
oours.
As from Monday 10th April ( i believe this date is correct though i may
be a little out) it will be ILLEGAL to possess Viral code of any
description, regardlessz of purpose. We are no talkin about malicious
use of such code, but merely possession ....
What can I say the bastards are at it again .... ah well with any luck
they`ll; get theirs in the next election! Howards already sold his
sould and is condemned to eternal damnation but a nice hit from a
double decker would please me no end in the mean time ....

540Mb Quantum Maverick hard drive is installed and ready to run. I will
back-up the board to VHS tape tomorrow. If everything goes well the
board will be running on the new machine on Monday night.
 
There should also be quite a difference in archive time, since Zip, Lha
and all the other external programs will be stored in RAM for instant
access. I will purchase another 2Mb of RAM in a few weeks.
 
The system will be running from Workbench 2.04, which means that I can
fully multi-task while the BBS is running as a background task or in
iconized mode. A 28Mhz Supra Turbo Accelerator card will also be
purchased in the near future.
 
I would also like to thank all the users who have subscribed to the
system during the last 6 months. We should be online 24hrs as soon as I
complete the system upgrade.
 
Thanks for the support,

The board is now running on a 540Mb Quantum Maverick hard drive. I have
created 3 partitions. 100Mb for my own personal use, 100Mb for the
message base and 340Mb for the file base.
 
Message archiving is now done in RAM. I will need to purchase some
extra RAM before I can store all the archiving software in RAM, so you
will still have to wait for a few seconds while ZIP or whatever is
loaded from the hard drive. (I think this drive has an access time of
around 12ms)
 
P.S> Lyppens Software Production's "Video Backup System" is excellent!
 
I backed up the entire BBS onto a single 3hr VHS tape and re-installed
it onto the new system without a single problem.

I have locked the serial port at 38400 since some users have been
having trouble with file transfers at 57600.
 
The board has been crashing during message downloads, but I think this
had something to do with the serial port being locked at 57600.
 
I will continue to monitor the system for the next couple of nights and
see if modifying the BBS configuration has solved the problem.

I told u all b4 that i could pick up sat tv from the guy who lived abuv
me, ok fairly easily expalined, thin floor, cable type etc.
the latest in the saga involves me being to listen to the NEXT DOOR
neighbours telephone conversations on my radio. The long wave band, and
guess wot freq ? :-> Thats rite 252 ! I was briefly led to believe that
they broadcasting[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[Dwere broadcasting
something other than the top twenty,  until i realised it was my next
door neighbour, talkin to her rels in blackpool. As she is an OAP the
conversation inevitably got round to the topic of bowel movements, at
which point i went for an indian :-> Seriously tho, i take it this dude
must have a cordless phone which trans / recvs at 252 LW ?
Im just curious ... zak M<

as will hardware facilities, altho the hardware quite good cept for the
modem, but that will be fixed very soon indeed, with a new high speed
jobby. There is sweet FA on the system on the moment, and im still
trying to decide a general direction, but it will be linked to
underground movement quite heavily. n e way i would be very gr8ful if
anyone who has a couple of mins could call, leave me a message,
commenting on any ideas u might have. This will giv me idea if the

Subject : hacking conference
Time    : 2:47:38 AM  04/27/1995
Just thought I'd inform of you of a forthcoming hacking conference in
Kings
College which was reported on in COmputer Weekly (Thursday, April 20th
1995).
Transcript follows:
 
POLICE UPROAR AS KING'S COLLEGE WELCOMES EUROPE'S TOP HACKERS
-------------------------------------------------------------
An assembly of some of the world's most notorious hackers is due to
convene at
a London university in July despite calls by police and computer
security
specialists for the conference to be banned.
Police forces in the UK and Europe are angry there is nothing they can
do to
stop the meeting at King's College taking place. They are concerned
that
hackers will learn new illegal techniques.
Organisers are publicising the event by promising the delegates will
"learn
new tricks, educate" and allow people to "meet the enemy". The
conference
goes under the title "Access All Areas".
It will also provide links to the internet and Superjanet, offering
high
bandwidth which could allow hacker sto download viruses, pornography
and the
notorious Satan tool that spots weaknesses in networks.
Two of the speakers at King's College, part of the university of
London, are
from the Dutch hacking organisations which are well known to
authorities. They
are Rop Gonggrijp of Hack-Tic Technologies, a group of ex-hackers
turned
Internet providers, and Felipe Rodriquez, director of the xs4all
foundation,
an internet access point in Holland.
Other speakers include Emmanuel Goldstein, editor of 2600, a hacker
magazine.
The publication's contributors include the recently arrested US hacker
Kevin
Mitnick.
Jim Bates, virus expert nad chairman of the institute of Programmers
and
Analysts, said, "Why is King's College lending its prestigious name to
a
scurrilous event like this? How do they justify this?"
A Dutch police spokesperson said, "We know that well-known hackers from
Holland are intending to attend this conference."
No one from King's College was available for comment.

Lets just hope that the nice people at King's College don't decide to
listen to the media hype and stop the conference from taking place. The
UK really needs something like this. I attended Hacktic's HEU
conference in Holland and there wasnt a single problem with the law.
 
Although the breakfast was a little dodgy and they decided to scrap the
barbeque plans. I ended up eating bread and cheese for the last day or
two... and a few space cakes. <g>

I'd suggest you find a cheap b&b type hotel in outer london as this
will be a lot cheaper than anything in inner London. You can just get a
travel card and use the tube, etc. I'd like to see that file from
Arrested Development if you can get your hands on it.

I agree, it would be nice to actually meet some of the people who have
active members of the underground scene since the days of HackerNet and
Palm Beach Data Network, etc. I met The Grim Reaper, Maelstrom, The
Dark Knight at the HEU conference in Holland and was later introduced
to Cherokee at the second UK 2600 meeting. Do the meetings at the
Trocadero still take place? A midlands meeting wold be nice for those
who live outside the M25.
 
If anyone actually purchases a ticket for AAA, let us know! I would
rather pay at the door, but I guess this may not be possible if the
event is as large as Hacktic's HEU conference.
 
I'm still a little pissed that I didnt get to attend last year's HOPE
conference in New York. Does anyone have a PAL version of the video
filmed at this event?

Babs actually hit his local (Edinburgh) pplod dialup, which is< I
think, the HQ of the anti-hacking unit. It may have been attached to
the PNC, but I don't believe he did anything to do with that.

I am looking into the possibility of advertising this system in
magazines such as .net and MicroMart. Since we are doing nothing
illegal, I see no problem in doing this. Simply discussing computer
underground activities and distributing technological research material
is not illegal. I have no idea if anyone actually uses this stuff. <g>
 
Also, I may be getting a UABBS t-shirt printed for the Access All Areas
conference in July. I am still deciding which logon screen to have
printed across the back. I guess black with white printing would be the
most effective. If there is a demand for them, I may sell them via the

I think advertising is still a bit risky. What about a compromise -
submit an ad to Phrack with the new number - lots of new users, who are
likely to be somewhat more clued-up than the general public on average.

Just a thought.

Try another mag than Phrack - I would imagine an ad in Phrack would
draw _less_ clued-up callers than some of the other ones. A good
underground board shouldn't need to be advertised in magazines like
that, anyway - so you guys should all be out spreading the word on the
other bbs's you call... I hear there is some cool info knocking around
on boards in places like Norway.

number you are calling from you are being watched by british
telescum... at first i thought that this was like really lame...but
then i called bt and they said that it is because certain exchanges
wont let you test your line using the engineers number.  Also there is
176..  but i tried both and nothing happened.  But about a year back I
can remember that it d it did work...now i am not shure about this
thing.  but it was a year ago...umm...would the cunts monitor my line
for like 1 year?  fuckit ...so stupid bastards are so unpredictable
anyway...
Any bt engineers on here like to tell us more about this test thing.  I
have come tot he conclusion that it is a load of shit..how about u lot?

I agree with your comments about good underground boards not needing to
advertise, but I want this system to be more than a good underground
board. I would like 6 nodes and telnet access, but I cannot do this if
I don't advertise to attract new subscribers.

the call to bt or somwthing... I think that this is like shit but can
somone please find out because it is driving me nuts..bt said that it

57600 seems pretty cool - allows two to one compression before the
serial speed starts to limit the transmission speed. (And we all know
how often one gets 2:1 compression :-( )

115200 allows the modem to be going flat out, but it's a hell of a
strain on most systems - only fast (DX2-66 +) PCs and PowerMacs are
happy with it, so far as I know.

Thanks mate, Ive been wondering about this for some time. I doubt my
processor would keep up with 115200 baud, but my 14.4k is working fine
with the serial locked at 57600.
 
I seriously doubt I will need one of these beasts for at least another
year, but I remember saying that when I bought my Supra 2400. <g>
 
Maybe I will set this bbs up on a 0898 line with a 300 baud modem, I
could be a millionaire in a week. ;-)

There are too many so called "elite" bulletin boards in my opinion. If
everyone was that uptight, how would the next generation of hackers and
phone phreaks learn?
 
I think this system should be available to those who have an interest
in learning, not just those who have "NeW WaReZ" to offer.

If you dial an invalid code like 010 + cc+acn with yer modem a message
comes up and states redial using 00 and then says yer aint beiong
charged for this call....

she reapeats it 2x or so you connect to a bt modem and it prints
instructions on der screen!!!!
Hmm looks like a 1200/75 ferkin telex connect!!

140 pounds. If I took out the smaller advert I would need at least 10
subscribers before I make any profit. I'd guess that an advert in .net
would attract at least 20 subscribers a month.
 
MicroMart charge 59.50 for an 1/8th page advert, however this would

Well, if Emmanual Goldstein (editor of 2600 magazine) is attending AAA,
you can be sure he will be selling t-shirts and magazines. He must have
made a fortune at the HEU conference in Holland. I think I was the

It`s nice to see that BT are charging 1p per minute for local

networks are going to take a lot of their customers.  60p per hour is
still not free, but I wouldn`t be surprised if they introduce free
local calls within the next couple of years. It looks like they are

Yeah, but free local call don't amount to shit at all. The breakthrough
will be free national calls (don't laugh, it'll happen eventually). LD
calls cost infinitessimally more to route than local ones, so the
difference in price would be hilarious if we weren't paying for it.

BTW, Babs (he of the police dialup :-) sez that BT do some sort of
tariff where all call between like midnight and 4 (ouch) are free or
practically free. But most BT staff don't know about it, so you have to
badger them for it big time.

Hi,

For anyone going to Cyberia while they're down for the AAA meeting,
the nearest tube stations are Goodge Street ( Northern or Victoria
lines )
or Tottenham Court Road ( Northern or Central lines ).

Cyberia's address is 39 Whitfield St. WC1. Voice # 0171 209 0983
& they have about 10 workstations to mess about from :)

Half an hour costs #2.50 ( last time I was in ) & more often than not
there's a wait of about 30 mins before you can get on a terminal.

Cappuccino, tea, coffee etc. are extra plus they do a gorgeous almond
pastry thing.

Sorry can't remember their opening times but I think it's into early
evening.

Cheers,

Daydog

I am looking into the possibility of advertising this system in
magazines such as .net and MicroMart. Since we are doing nothing
illegal, I see no problem in doing this. Simply discussing computer
underground activities and distributing technological research material
is not illegal. I have no idea if anyone actually uses this stuff. <g>
 
Also, I may be getting a UABBS t-shirt printed for the Access All Areas
conference in July. I am still deciding which logon screen to have
printed across the back. I guess black with white printing would be the
most effective. If there is a demand for them, I may sell them via the

Interesting idea.. pretty good 1 aswell. U might have a problem with
some of the sw on here, I haven't checked out the file lists but I 
would guess that you have copyright stuff on like cellular software? :)
I don't know about the legal issues either, maybe it would be illegal
to
just distribute info like this in the uk.. u seen how upset the papers
get when some kids get hold of the jolly rogers cookbook! Bomb making
instructions tend to cause alarm <g>. 
 
U seen how totse has a 900 number so people can get xtra slak by
calling
it and the operator gets load$a ca$h? It would probably work well here,
I reckon the users of this system who actually phreak would use it...
 
Telnet access could be interesting but could attract the wrong sort of
people.. if u need to post ads then u could try posting on alt.ph.uk, 
just to see what sort of a reaction there is. The thing is BT dudes
will
read it, they can get pretty pissed off but then again u would have to 
face that problem with advertising in anywhere else.
 
If u could get this system on 10 nodes or so there could be kewl multi
user chats like on totse.... funded by the 0891 number of course ;)
If only demon had an 0891 number they could make a fortune off me :)

well the press of late has gone internet crazy, there have been loads
of stories about porn, bomb making, credit card fraud, racism, fake
mailing..it will be VERY SOON that laws on both sides of the atlantic

by their laws and now they are moving onto our minds, but they arn't

Well, as far as I know AAA is still going ahead. Didn't you see the
details published in the June issue of .net (page 9) and the latest
issue of WIRED (page 25)?
 
I will phone Simon tonight just to be 100% sure,

I just phoned Simon Gardener and I am pleased to let everyone know that
Access All Areas has NOT been cancelled.

Why some people feel it is necessary to spread rumours like this is
beyond me. Maybe BT are getting a little nervous about a conference of
this kind being held in the U.K. <g>

Just a thought, but what about an info door. Numbers of the internet
service providers, anti-virus companies, Jensen Tool's 0800 number, and
so on...

Everyone could simply contribute any useful information they had, and
after a while, it would develop into a pretty useful reference for
hackers, phreakers, those making stuff from the Jolly Rogers etc.

Yeah, that's pretty much the best way of doing it, I suppose. Are there
any Wall doors that log old messages to a file, cos that'd be the best
way of keeping the info as a reference. Perhaps put it with the file
lists as a free download to attract subscribers?

     While we're on the change scam subject, I was amazed to find the
other day that the old 'strimmers' still work on some frit machines,
with a couple of mods:  take about 8" of strimmer wire and split the
end bit to a distance of about 2 cm.  Then superglue a pound coin into
the split.  Finally, file the strimmer wire/glue down to be flush with
the sides of the coin, if necessary.  This gadget will work on MOST
machines with the black plastic coin slot, the slot is diagonal (umm,
top right - bottom left I think) and there is a rectangular orange
reject button just below the slot.  You know the ones.  Use it with
discretion cos some machines are alarmed nowadays, but give it a try -
I have actually seen a friend empty several machines with one, so it
DOES still work.  Good luck :)

It is fairly easy really as long as you'r in your own gaff. Just put
all the utility bills in the name you want to use and, providing you go
to a nice bank they should let you open one. Any ID you can get with a
piccy and your name(bus pass, library card) is likely to sway them to
open the account without a serious form of I.D. (birth cert, passport
etc.)
Just give it a go with those type of things, it worked for me.....

     A birth certificate is commonly accepted to be a serious form of
I.D., but it aint.  All u need to do is write off to the registrar
general (address not handy but I'll dig it out if anyone wants) with
someone's full name, district, hospital they were born at and date of
birth (and about seven quid) and you will receive a photocopy of their
birth certificate by return of post.  Neat.

conference, even if the main room was in the basement at Kings College
and cellphones were not usable.
 
I took about 10 photo's while at the event and I hope to have these
online as soon as I get my film developed.
 
Special thanks must goto Alchemist for his kind accomodation and
assistance after I fell down his stairs. <g>

The reason that I have not been around for a while is because that I
got
busted.  Well sort of...  The bastard from the fraud squad came round
to the
house (2 of them) at 10:00pm ....As i walked past a nice red k reg 1.8
i
cavalier I noticed a nice new b.t car phone in it and a mobile
recharging I
though about smashing the window but it was a bad idea because next
thing I
saw was 2 fat men walking towards me ...One of the (Adrian Gorham) said
are
u ect ect...I said yes they said we are from b.t can we have a
word...then
my mum came out with the dog ready to beat them up *8O|  !!!  They said
I
would know what it is about and the4y just wanted to give me a friendly
warning.  I didnt know weather to let them in the hosue becasue once
they
are in they would be able to do anything.  So then I looked at my watch
and
saw that it was 10:00pm so I said that u r too l8 I have got work in
the
morning can u come back tommorow...they said yes 7pm becasue we have to
drive from Milton Keynes.  So i cleared out of the shit in my room
(paper
ect) and then they came...they said that I had been using AT&T's andMCI
calling cards from home and they want it to stop.  I first came to
their
attention in 1990 when I was trying to social engineer some information
from
a south african operator.  Well after all this they had a word with the
oldies and then went....So that was it.....they didnt want to caarge
because
they said I was not doing enough for it to be worth their while.  sorry
for
not answering any messages though I didnt want to call the bbs because
they
would see that I am still on the scene and calling bbs's and I didnt
want to
get the bbs in shit because it is the best in the u.k.  Oh and a good
idea
for all those elite people that went to Access All Areas would be not
to use
the 500 AT&T cards that got handed out.  Oh and the person that has
been
calling me at l8 hours on friday and saturday nights is in for a shock.
 You
keep calling (you know who you are and you will read this message
because u
r on this bbs) me at stupid hours and I dont like it...no one does. 
And the
sheets of paper that B.T gave me to look at which had times of calls
where
they came from and how long they lasted for had your number on it at 19
intervals at l8 night early morning.  Dont do it any more because it
would
not be good as u will get busted and then I will come round and break
your
nose.

 Good luck people...stay out of trouble

  StEaLtH


p.s  If you think that your line is being monotored call 151 and ask
them
what equipment is one the line and if your modem has got a line test
thing
on it while you are on to a bbs do +++ and then AT%Q and slap the enter
key.
 If it is like above 10 then they probably are....Dont ask them to
repair
the line if you have got a Zoltrix modem because all they do is shove
more
resistence up the line (put more voltage up it) and it fucks the modem
up...well it isnt b.t approved anyway.  Oh and if you dial numbers and
they
some times dont register then that is also a good clue.  If you have
already
had faults then it will be at the exchange is they are monitoring the
line.

been investigated once.. hmmm.. are you sure that somebody didn't grass
on ya? hmmm.. very strange.. yer.. just one more thing.. about them
monitoring the line, where did ya get yer info from? coz sometimes when
I dial numbers they don't register.. and on certain calls there is
always line noise for like 10 seconds.. I think it's nothing but if you
can tell me more then please do :)

All message archiving is now done in ram. This has made a great
increase in speed while the system scans for messages. For example,
scanning all the messages in the Computer Hacking message base would
have taken exactly 20 seconds. Scanning the same messages will now take
12 seconds. Almost a 50% speed increase while the system scans messages
for archiving.

Global I think R selling them - as are a couple of other office

projector.. but the output should do for crap display ;) (trust me..
the display really is shite on a TV from any computer..)... but - i
think they were rather xpensive tho.. wel.. a cheapo one was about L79
-> L99, up to L299 for a real xpensive (but better quality) one..
I will find some prices for def if you want ?

Subject: Scotland and Italy Crack Down on "Anarchy Files"
---------------------------------------------------------
 
Anarchists online were the target of two recent police actions, one in
Scotland and one in Italy.  Scotland Yard is investigating net-based
anarchist dissidents allegedly using online media to advocate
anti-government violence, at least one of whom was arrested several
weeks
ago by detectives from the UK's Special Branch police agency, on
charges
of sedition - the first such case in the UK to involve
computer-mediated
communications.  The suspect appears to have been a Scottish system
operator, running a BBS called Terminal Boredom, which may have
archived
some of the publications of anarchist publisher Spunk Press, a
voluteer-based collective (though Spunk itself does not know the sysop,
and says he is not directly associated with them).
 
A Computer programmer, activist, and editor for Spunk Press in Scotland
and who conducts seminars on progressive activism and Internet basics,
was
recently targetted in the British press, and associated with the online
anarchists under investigation. A highly questionable article in the UK
_Sunday_Times_ by Adrian Levy and Ian Burrell (Mar. 5) accused the
Spunk
editor (who prefers not to be named again due to negative publicity) of
encouraging the use of computer technology for organizing violent and
illegal acts, as part of an online terrorist coalition, at an
"anarchist
campaign" last October (described by attendees rather as a conference
on
anarchist politics and online activism).
 
However, the Levy/Burrell article is both replete with errors (it
refers
in one place to FTP archive directories "booby trapped with viruses
that
attack the computers of unauthorised intruders" - an impossibility, as
any
experienced Internet user would know) and remarkably biased (the
article
alleges that supposed 'anarchy files' encourage students to "take part
in
dirty protests and riots.") Additionally it makes many wild and highly
unrealistic accusations of global anarchist conspiracy (led by "an
intelligent and well-informed girl", a British student, according to
another similar report.) No relevant evidence or sources are cited.
 
Spunk "maintains an archive of anarchist material at umich [the U. of
Michican anonymous FTP site] and other sites. It includes historical
documents, articles by the likes of Chomsky & Bookchin, the text of
various anarchist magazines and, contrary to what the Sunday Times
said,
nothing about bomb-making or other [seditious material]", Mitzi Waltz,
a
technology writer and US member of Spunk, told EFF, adding that another
member of the Spunk collective, in Italy, suffered a police raid on his
political discussion BBS, BITS Against the Empire, Waltz disagreed
vehemently with the _Sunday_Time_ article: "I have met Ian Heavens and
he's about the furthest thing from a terrorist you can imagine. I was
at
the conference referred to [in the _Sunday_Times_ article] also last
fall
in London. [We] led workshops on using the Internet for communications
and
networking. Basic stuff, like 'what's a BBS?'..."
 
To date, only some of the seized materials have been returned, and the

BBS
itself, other computers, and diskettes are still being held for further
investigation.  No one has been arrested, but the individuals raided
have
been formally charged with terroristic subversion crimes, which carry
severe penalities: 7-15 years in prison.  Paccagnella expresses
skepticism
regarding the likelihood that authorities really want him in prison for
15
years, reasoning he and the others charged are probably expected to be
intimidated into plea-bargaining. "What they really want is clearly to
scare us," he said.
 
A Clinamen press release noted wryly: "According to the authorities,
the
bulletin board's activities in pursuit of free communication and
counter-
information represent a danger to the democratic order...Clearly nobody
has explained to them that hard disks and diskettes can be copied in a
matter of minutes. Meanwhile, those facing prosecution, as well as the
hundreds users of BITS Against the Empire BBS, must continue to wait as
police computer experts work to uncover not only the DOS 'copy'
command,
but also that very dangerous information - from publicly available
electronic journals, articles and academic essays on the social use of
new
technology, to publicly accessible electronic discussion groups - which
has inspired the charge of subversive association with terrorist
intent."

I came across the ascii text of Clifford Stoll's book "The cuckoos
egg" the other day, but its in German. If enough people are
interested I can translate it (its 700k tho), or does someone
else want to take a try if I upload it ?

Anybody stupid enough to place personal details on any hp board is
asking to be busted anyway, I've never left even the slightest clue as
to my whereabouts or identity on any board, and I'm not short of
accounts, its a matter of common sense, at the end of the day your

I am thinking of making UABBS a closed system in the near future. The
only way to get an account would be through one of our current users or
by contacting me via email or voice and requesting an account.
 
I could always create an account with the username "guest" and
password "guest" which would only allow the user to send feedback
asking for an account. Of'course I would need them to leave a chosen
account name and password first.
 
The system will be limited to 100 user accounts and non-active accounts
will be removed after 90 days.

know everyone is going on about the shit with maelstroms bbs at the
moment but a phone number is used untill the person can verify that he

Yeah well I've been trying to card a CIS account but it keeps saying
"credit card not valid
I've tryed it with like 20 cards I generated and none have worked.
Dunno about that 5 thing but there are a few 0800's that give out a 6.

I saw this article in a copy of the Readers Digest (ahem!), and it 
looked a might bit interesting.
   
             Begin well spelled and punctuated bit
=====================================================================
The cost of international calls can be cut by using an intelligent 
switching system. The British company Interglobe Telecommunications
provides cardholders with international access to the service in 42
countries. After ringing and entering a PIN (personal identification
number), the company calims calls can be made substantially cheaper 
rates - generally at least 30 percent - than with other charge cards
by automaticlly routing the call through whiever network is offering
the cheapest calls. The cardholder is billed monthly.
For a free card, call Interglobe on 0171-972-0800.

I think it is a long distance service and not many home users haVE GOT
it...it is more for the large companys that make lots of long distance
calls...try calling one up and saying u r from the comapany and u need
the card to check that you are being charged the right calls....then
say they will get a discount of 10 quid for there troubles....

It means to kind of extract valid card no.s from an existing valid
card.

The board is running as a background task in iconised mode. This means
that the system does not display anything at my end, just an icon on my
Workbench screen. I know this gives me quite a bit of extra ram, so I
guess it makes the system run a little faster also.

Due to circumstances currently beyond my control, the Fera Factory will
be down until Further notice. It should be running on RA when its back
on, and hopefully this should eliminate some of the problems some
people were having with connections.

On my Amiga I can currently emulate the following machines, operating
systems; MS-Dos, Apple Mac, Apple II, Vic 20, Commodore 64, Atari ST,
BBC, MSX, UNIX, Spectrum, etc... Most of these emulators will also
fully multitask so I can run the BBS at the same time.
