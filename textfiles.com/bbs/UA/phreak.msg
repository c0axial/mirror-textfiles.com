you canb get many type of Scanners with an RS232 port, or did
you mean for FREE?
 
Try those radio magazines like WIRELESS, they always have LOADS
of scanning equipment advertised, I think the cheapest model
with an RS232 is about 250-300 pounds.

Did any of you know that 112 is now the new equivalent of 999 emergency
service? 
 
My father works for British Steel and someone told him a telephone number
to ring and a few digits which gave him a dialling tone. He was using this
a couple of weeks ago to phone home from somewhere  while he was on a
course for free!. He just let it out in conversation but couldnt remember
the exact number, he thought it was something like a 3 digit followed by a
4 digit, I have been scanning the 3 digits 1xx and hence came across the
new emergency number by accident. Apparently the new number is a result of
the delay taken to connect a call using  pulse dialling i.e. 27 pulses on
999 as opposed to 4 for the new number. 
 
Anyway, I shall try and get him  to find out that number he phoned as I
think it might not be useful enough (bound not to be!).
 
anyone know of any 3 digit accouting systems besides 144 which possibly
accept a 4 digit pin. This service may be run by the COTEN communications
company.

  Yeah I noticed the same thing with 112, doing the sam as you actually (I
wuz bored!) I dont think its to do with tone/pulse tho, otherwise surely
they would use 111 (makes more sense).  I have been told that it's to do
with the emergency numbers in other countries, i.e. what happens if
someone from Germany or whatever needs to quickly dial emergency, and
doesnt know it's 999 over here..

Has anyone seen that text file currently doing the scene which explains
how to give a BT phone card unlimited credits? The file says that you must
place a strip of magnetic video tape over the card credit strip and then
rub over it lightly with a HB pencil. I know this sounds like warez doods

 2. PHONE CARDS
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Don't throw that used phone card away coz heres how to get unlimited
phonecalls
all you need is a piece of unused videotape (which you glue ( pritstik
works
well )across the magnetic strip ( indicated by the parallel lines) the
tape
section is then rubbed with a 2B pencil LIGHTLY to leave a fine coating on
the
strip. When the card is inserted the tape and carbon from the pencil
causes
reverse magnetism which nine times out of ten the magnetic detector in the
card
slot cannot handle, so it allows you unlimited free time on the phone.Of
course
this is for information only and I know you wouldn't do this coz its
breaking
the law!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ok there is that scam phantasm mentioned, courtesy of someone called
Lensman (author of file which this is extracted from) so respect to that
man...

Tell us some more about this machine as i am very interested in this.
Is the newly obtained ESN number easy to burn into another Cell Phone?
Once the ESN is burned into its new host, how quick is the Cell phone
opperators Dbase in tracking and switching off the ESN?
Also Wavetek in norwich is meant to be selling a simmilar unit very
soon,but for 1495 pounds,thier american parent company is to be selling it

Re Cellulare Stuff
 
The difficulty of burning in a new ESN is dependant on the phone.. for
exampl;e i specifically have a NEC P3 as i have the modified roms on it
that add the function of changing ESN via the function button.. most
cellulars are failry simple to reprogramme with the right lead and a bit
of patience.. but as a general rule the older ones are generally easier.
 
As for blocking of the esn.. i have actaully had my lkegit esn barred as i
had it in both of my phones at once while both were on different cells and
withing 5 hours had a bar [placed on it .. took a while of talking to
Securicor cellular to convince them that my phone was playing up and i was
havinbg it tested by a shop.
 
It also seems that MOST people who have a mobile are relaytively naive to
the fact that  by giving oput theyre ESN t{at they are allowing someone
else to use theyre account and i have had quite a surprising amount of
luck engineering teh numbers out oif peopl eby pretending to be from
Cellnet this way its alos possible to obtain when they get theyre  bills
as a pointer to when to stop using their ESN's..

At my uni there are now loads of Mercury phone boxes . 
While i was examining it i noticed that there were two boxes above the
box. One is for power the other one i found to be a normal
standard phone socket. Once opened (just unscrew cover) there is a normal
phone socket. From here you can plug in your phone and dial. 
The line is just a BT line not mercury the box probably has its own 
mercury account number as there is slight delay on picking up the handset
,perhaps this could be used on normal BT payphones to get phree calls.
These boxes are also in most post offices.

basically rewired the answering machine jack on my old Binatone phoen to
take the SB output directly.. only problem now is that for some reason
after my alterations.. (also wired up  so i can sample directly off the

free before dialling.. also my first attempt had the unfortunate
consequence oif  senign all the ringers in my house apeshit whith a

the only way so far i have been able to seize mercury so far is through
dial services after they place a call nack to the uk .. as someone
mentioned here already it seems onyl to accept kp1 and the fact you have
to have a working AT&T to get put through makes it a bit pointless..
interestingly though i placed a call to germany on it and found i was also
able to seize and dial off the line there as well .. although not for
holland.. i did try calling the mercury international 0500800800 i think
but you cant seize that (although i dont knwo if i would want to its just
a BIT too close to home heh)

on the subject of bxoing has anyone been playing with trindiad since it
went down  last yearive had great fun finding the routing codes for all
the diferent islands .. ie kp1-0088... for grenada and also found the only
combination you are allwed to dial with kp2 is kp2-592... cant get
snywhere with it though though i have manged to find a few numbers that
come up with a recording 'interbnationla access to this line is
prohibited'

I've just found a couple of AT&T teleconference dialups in Georgia.
kp2-104044207309-st
kp2-104044207310-st
Anyone wishing to use these services will require a loop in the USA.
Just tell the operator you would like to start a conference and give her
one side of the loop when she asks for your telephone number.
Dial the other side of the loop as soon as you disconnect and wait for
the operator to connect your conference nodes.
If anyone has any working non-filtered loops in the USA or Canada, send a
<M>ail reply or Internet mail 'uabbs@works.uucp'.

Runnign conferences off loops gets you blacklisted very fast.. i used to
do it by calling the 800 and giving one end of a loop.. it was great the
confs last more than 6 hours and you can have control but it also got
everyone i called blacklisted after 4-5 conf's i used to run em off a 206
loop .. still aorund and theyll still billto it i beleive 206-699-0018/19
 
actaul if you are internationl agetttong blacklisted is no problem.. as 
AT&T dont knwo how many digits international numbers are so if you are
blacklisted just get whoevers running it to dial your number with and
extra digit on the end and it works fine heh

possible to enter your AT&T card, then by dialling any number in the uk

using the mci satellite settings, and proceed to dial using A0636etc.C|s>2;

Does anyone know much about the new Digital cellular phone service that
Mercury are going to launch this month? Apparently it is impossible to
eavesdrop etc. which is what Mercury are promoting it as - more reliable
