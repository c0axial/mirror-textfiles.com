Does anybody know anything about this new computer that will,
supposedly, break any RSA cipher?  Its being developed now and will be
out  within twenty years.  People are saying that its a boon to
criminals, because they'll be able to decipher bank info. hmmm....

Has anyone seen any utils on any BBs or on the net which will decrypt a
ARJ file which has a password. I compressed a load of files a while
back and for some reason put a password on it, for they life of me I
cannot remember what it was (real fuckin stupid).
I have seen stuff to bypass ZIPs but not ARJ. I have a feeling that the
ARJ doesnt store the actual password so it could be god damn difficult
if not possible. Any help would be appreciated.

I believe that I may have an ARJ cracker somewhere. Quite good if I
remember rightly. I'll check whether I'm imagining things or not whenI
log off.

Positive I've seen one, but phucked if I know where. I think you're
right about it not storing the password, so depending on how long your
original password was, it could take a while. Hope you've got a
486/'040 or whatever :)

If any of ya have any flash backs or shit like that and remember where
you seen the ARJ cracker please let me know as it is quite important.

As far as i know DES is similar to PGP.  ie it uses a key system where
u have public & secret ones....  wunderfull werld cryptography....

I have just added a load of material dealing with data encryption to
the file areas. Check them out, there are many dealing with DES and how
to crack it.

I fink Vlad may have his wires crossed - I'm fairly sure DES uses the
*same* key to encrypt and decrypt data, and is thus not in the same
class of encryption methods (public key encryption) as RSA (the
alg-o-riddim) from PGP.

i am 100% sure its crackable because i was told be a very reliable
contact then Orange have a card of system to listen into ANY cal on the
network..... if u can listen into the call and its encripted then u can
most certianly make calls of others ESNs

Has anyone here came across any trunks that ACCEPT KP2 and dont appear
to send u any shit? its accepts KP2+21 digits then an error message
comes up.... if u do KP2-cc -R- XxXxXXxx -ST it kicks ya off... there
are currently 3 lines i have found with this system!

does anyone know the score about pgp, while on the web i looked up
some page to do with pgp, and it says there are 2 different pgp systems
around now 2.13 i think which uses RSA system and is the MIT version
which is only for use in the US and canada, and version 2.13i which is
a non rsa system and is for use in all other countries which allow
programs like pgp, BTW pgp is banned in countries like france because
there any form on encryption is Illigal..anyway which is best and
which is safer and are there back doors in the new versions which
allow goverments to decode it?

A backdoor was confirmed by Zimmerman in the latest version(s)... i
can't remember which though. Stick to the earlier vers...

PGP 2.6 is available in the states under the non-export code, ie
anyone there can use it, but exporting outside of US territorial
waters is illegal and carries a maximum 10 year sentance (which is
that the Justice Court in the states is still trying to hit
Zimmerman with).

PGP 2.6ui is the version available for use in europe which carries
slightly different encoding to get around the non export clause.

The back doors you are thinking of are the back doors in DES and
RSA which the US government introduced. To make cracking crypted
files easier the National Security Agency (NSA) in the states
took the key length down from 64 bits to 56 bits. PGP gets
around this by introducing larger keys and doubly hashing
input files.

Either version (2.6 or 2.6ui) is just as good, the differences
are minor and just deal with the fiddly points of law

while at AAA i heard someone talk about some system for the PC where
you could use a sound card and encrypt voice traffic over the fone line
does anyone know what it is called or what ftp sites it may be on.

There is a voice encryption program for the PC called "Neurotic" or
something similar. To use it you will need at least a 9600 baud modem
and a sound blaster card with a microphone connected. I think it uses a
similar encryption method to PGP.
 
I have a feeling that the program is on here somehere... let me check
and I will get back to you guys.

Sorry, the program is called "Nautilus" and IS available from the
MS-Dos Executables file area. Download file number "201" and forget
