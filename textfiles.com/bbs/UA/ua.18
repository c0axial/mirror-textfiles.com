The pirate Sky cards won't work when the series 9 cardz are all
switched on, in about a months time.  The only reason that they
work now is coz someone at Sky sold all the codez.  When the 09
cardz are all switched on the pirates will be fucked, until
someone at Sky gets their hands on the new codez and sells them on.
So don't bother just yet, wait and see what happens when all the
09 cards are switched on.

/\Sterix,

I have a scanner program i started writing to dialplus stuff a few years
back, it sends stuff to port and receives ok, if i remember correctly
though it used to lock up rather frequently, think that was just something
to do with the size of buffer i had there and an incompatible speed
between port and modem, data coming in too fast for program to handle,
any way you are welcome to the source code if it's any use to you, at
least you can see how to fuck around with the serial port. Let me know if
ya are interested, i'll dig it out for you and upload it.

here) and try & hack them.  If you dont get any of them, check out gopher
for listings of college dialups - this is a cool way to do it, you'd be
surprised at the number of dialups you find in gopher.  Whan ure in
somewhere patch the fucker and u got free access to inet until you fuck

tongue, your eyes are blind your breath has stopped, your heart is dead.
Your thoughts run rampant, you long since died, not once, but many times,

 Title: VTxxx codes
  From: George King [87]
  Time: Wed Apr 27 05:28:57 1994
  Does anyone know if it is possible to program the answerback on a VT
series terminal remotely with an escape sequence?  And if so, what is the
sequence?   The reason I ask is this:  we used to do a hack on a vax
inolving the terminal answerback; what you do is, program the answerback
with this string:

      ^Ymail<cr>last<cr>ext/noh .com<cr>ex<cr>@ .com<cr>

  And then send a mail message to anyone using the terminal with a ^E
in the Subject: field and a DCL procedure in the body of the message.
The ^E would trigger the answerback when the mail was delivered, and then
that string would break out of whatever the guy was doing, extract the
prcedure and run it...problem is that you needed physical access to the
terminal to set the answerback.

  I think the info I need is in the 'VTxxx Programmer's Manual' but I
haven't been able to get hold of it ( I haven't tried VERY hard yet )
so if anyone has access to a copy let me know.

  The internet site gan.ncc.go.jp is open to the gopher hole as described
in the 8lgm advisory..set up the .links file that the avisory describes
somewhere, then telnet to gan and login a gopher.  Find your site, select
the item you set up and you will get a shell when you quit telnet.
Incidentally quite a few sites that run a public gopher server are still
vulnerable to this hole, so get using it before they close them all up!

George,
you mean to say you missed the Roger Cook report last summer, it was
fuckin funny. They were busting loadsa people for child porn and stuff,
they raided the premises of quite a few bbs's and then they bust the door
open of this flat in some marina type complex, burst into this bedroom and
said Alex Coe, we are arresting you ..... get out of your fuckin bed (his
girl friend was realll uygly as well). Anyway he tried to throw his hard
drive outta the window but the patio doors were shut and it just bounced
back into the room. the bust was totally porn related.

 Does anyone here have any reliable info on caller id in the UK?
I know it's going on at the moment because I had a rather close call
with it last year - I knew an op at the site I was hacking, and was
tipped off just in time when they installed it, and subsequently saw a
sample printout with dates, times and numbers - scary!  Anyways, how
widespread is it, and is there any way to 'defeat' it (other than calling
from someone else's number :) )

   Oh yeah, and whilst we're at it, anyone got any clue how far back BT's
records go?  What I'm saying is, is it possible for company X to discover
that they have been hacked a month or two after the event, go to BT with
the date & time of the breakin, and BT to turn round and say 'well
such-and-such a number made a call to your modem number at that time!'
Or am I just being COMPLETELY paranoid?

  Anyways, until I know the answers to those questions I am doing nothing
on a direct dialup whatsoever...seems sensible to me.  It's just loads of
hassle having to hang onto current dialups for internet or whatever in the
states then calling back here just to hack the company next door or
whatever!

found out that if you replace the 272 with 179 you can call most of the

Well, seeing as so many people seem to be interested in Social engineering

up you're local USA direct operator on 890011 or whichever dialup you
fancy...and say the folwing (YOu will reuire a valid name/address/phone #)

Hello, this is Mr.fraud (or whoever), and I'm currently on vacation in
England...Is there a number you can connect me too so that I can order a
calling card to make calls back to the us during my stay here?" Thwey'll
then put you through to 816-654-6000 usually, Kansas City Card
Centre...Then say "This is blalba" repeat that, they'll ask for
name/address/phone number, maybe social security number...US soc. sec.
numbers asre in the format xxx-xx-xxxx eg: 141-16-6588 ... this does NOT
need to be valid! 8-) ... Now most operators will allow you to choose your
own AT&T number, 11 digits in length unlike the standard AT&T card which
is 14 digits long...so there, you have in 24hrs (activation time) a
working AT&T card of you're very own (sort of!)...Other operators if
they're having a bad day will perhaps ask you what your job is blabla just
bullshit this bit, they don'yt check it at all...Then they'll ask you to
call back tommorrow...just do so, don't worry about it, and thery'll 99%
give you you're calling card! Tada (fanfare) - it's that easy...

You say"Hello, this is <fake name> from AT&T.  We suspect that there are
illegal charges on your AT&T calling card.  In order to verify that it is

Don't use a "safe house". You don't need to and it stops the
mixup/confusion between the card holders address and the drop address. Use
the card holders address but "stop" the package at the courier depot.
phone carding is probably on its way out now though.

I'm thinking of starting carding, but I need to know how to get a 'safe'
house, can anyone who has carded succesfully please tell me how hou did
it, what you used as a safe house, where you got the card number from,
what sort of stuff you bought, where you bought it from, etc.

Cheers, Flash.

I read a message on here by Roughman that said you should get stuff sent
to the cardholders address then stop packages at the depot.  How d'ya do
that then???

AHAAAA!!
Getting the package stopped (RE:)
After you have given all your credit details and address etc. ring back
about half an hour later and say something about how you have been called
away to an important business meeting in Scotland and must catch the red
eye, and no one will be in although you can pas by the Courier depot on
your way to the airport. Basically say something that seems like a
legitimate excuse and try your best to get the Consignment Number from him
as you need it for the courier depot. Once you have this number you can
ring up the depot and say somthing that you are expecting a package but
wont be in give them the Consignment number and they will be happy to
"Stop" the package for you to come and pick it up. When you get to the
depot all you have to do is sign a form and the goods are yours!
sometimes there is no Consignment numberas some couriers dont use them,
if this happens just find the depot and try to get them to stop the
package by name and address alone. With this method try to find out which
courier company the shop uses as some couriers won't let you stop the
package like Securicor or Link or Royal mail.
they dont really ask for I.D but have a bus pass ID made out in the name
of the card holder just in case.

Eureka!!  I've just thought of the safest and easiest way of carding
ever!...use your own card!!

Now, if you're thinking "Hold on a minute Flash, that's bollocks isn't
it?  Then I'd be stealing from myself."  The idea is this:-

Order some stuff using your own card number, name and address.
Call the company back saying you'll have to pick up the goods from the
depot, they then 'stop' the stuff for you to pick up from there.
Go and pick it up, and sign for it in your name but different to your
signature.
When you get the bill, immediately phone the credit card co. and complain
violently that they've charged you for stuff that you didn't buy.
Then, hopefully, they look into it, see that it was collected from the
depot and didn't have your real signature.  They then say "Oh shit, we've
been ripped off...sigh...the youth of today."
They then apologise and take it off your bill.

Fuckin' genius or what??

If nobody else has thought of this before, I'm going to call this the
'Flash Method' <G>.  Any comments?

Hi Flash.

Saw your messages about the 'using your own card' method.

I can say from experience - DON'T DO IT!

The 'Fraud Squad' will grill you like a steak! They get statements from
EVERYONE, get the Attendant who gave the parcel to ID you, consult any
video footage (most depots have several cameras, of which film can be kept
upto anything like a year! PLus the depot will ask for ID!!! What do you
do abuot that? And if it's used how do you explain that someone got all
the info etc.....

As you see it's full of flaws... I did'nt reply to look big-headed but
because I was worried that someone might actualy try it!!

P.S In my case the Police had a warrent to search my house!!!!!!!

Oii flash most of those places have cameras in them,so if they did
'Investigate' they would see you there,although you could deny that its
you and you look nothing like that skiny geezer etc.. The risk aspect goes
up every time and how many times can you do this on your own card eh?
I know a girl who maxxed her own card in a shop, then she reported her
card, the fraud squad just looked at the security film and "Hi Dad i'm in
jail"
Your better off with the method outlined earlier the "Roughman Stop"

  Time: Sun Jan 30 01:27:01 1994
Okay! So my Flash method had a few glitches, I can't be perfect all the
time.  What do you expect, that was just the 'prototype'.  Now here's
the revised Flash method...
Follow the old one until you are about to go into the depot and pick up
the goodies.  Now, (really clever this bit) wander around until you find
some street urchin living in a cardboard box or something.  Get talking
to the poor unfortunate, then ask them if they'd like to earn some easy
money.  This may scare them off, but hopeully you could get them to
carry out the final, and dangerous part of the method for you.  Then if
they get sussed out and nicked, you bugger off down the road.  When they
start to ask questions, just say "I've never seen this person before in
my life, officer." then as they're dragged off kicking and screaming,
say "Poor thing, obviously mad."  I mean, who are they going to
beliveve?  If they do pull it off, you just give them a tenner for their
trouble or beat them up, depending on how you feel, or how big they are.
This way if it goes wrong everyone's happy, you get away with it, the
'urchin' gets either money or food and shelter, and the dibbles get
someone to show their truncheons and pieces of rubber hose-pipe.

Has anyone tried carding with their own card using a 'safe house' or
'drop'. i.e. Ordering shit with your own card, getting it sent to a fake
address, then claiming you didn't buy it when the bill comes?
Would this work?

P.S. Index, the catalogue shop, allow you to phone and order by credit
card, then pick it up from the shop.  Has anyone tried carding doing
this?  Was it as easy as it sounds?? Is there a way they check up the
details before they let you order??

I haven't been able to try it yet, so I'll have to take his word for it.
This is what he told me to do... You need 2 people, one switches off
the machine at the socket for around 3-5 seconds.  Then you switch it
back on and when some shit appears on the LED readout, the other guy
starts pressing the button you want like mad, don't hold it down, just
keep pressing it like crazy until the readout says VENDING, then out
comes your free chocky bar...WAAAHEY!!  Well, my mate says it works
anyway.

When delivery men deliver packages, do they have to deliver it to the
address? cos I've had a dead good idea!  Instead of going to the trouble
of arranging a 'drop' for the stuff you've carded, get it delivered to a
block of flats and wait outside for the courier.  When the guy is about
to go into the building, ask him if he's got any stuff for you as you're
locked out and waiting for a flatmate, etc. to come and let you in.
Does anyone know if this would work, or would he HAVE to deliver it to
the flat?

  Time: Tue Feb 22 22:16:12 1994
I didn't know where to put this msg so I thought soc. eng. was close
enough...

Here's the deal: I'd like to know the dangers of carding in the following
circumstances... If you are using a brand new card and the company is
willing to send to a different address is there much danger of getting
caught? Would it be workable to keep ringing different shops until you
find one willing to mail to a different address (using a good excuse
obviously and using a different card every shop) or is it possible that
they might phone the card-holder for verification of the order or
something ? I'm talking about virgin cards so the shop itself would have
no idea it was stolen until after the purchase.
What are the dangers after the pickup if you use a drop-site ?

I take it, also, that there would be little or no danger if carding to the
proper address on the card ?

Thanks in advance

The best way to do it is to card it to the actual owners (card owners that
is) house when they are on vacation whatever, and either fax the
parcel-courier firm a letter saying you hereby authorise them to leae it
on your porch whatever or stand outside and collect it, "oh thanks mate"
etc...But either way this isnt hacking this is just fraud and sucks the
big one...so forget it...how overjoyed would you be to have to pay up 800

I dunno if this will work with other bus services but it hasn't failed
once since I started doing it, (what the fuck are you talking about,
Flash?) Aha! I'm talking about printing your own bus tickets, not just
any old bus tickets, but the ones where you "pay once for a days travel"
you know, in Manchester, they're called Daysaver tickets and in
Rossendale they're called Rover tickets, anyway you get the idea.
A mate of mine had the idea a while ago, all you need is a computer (I
expect most of you have one) and a printer (crappier the better).
Now, get yourself a daysaver, or whatever, ticket then copy it out in an
art package, this may take a while, but after that you only need to
change the date.  Okay, done that? Good.  Now for the tricky bit, getting
a blank roll of tickets, hopefully, bus drivers in your part of the world
are as clueless as they are around here, all I did was get onto buses and
ask for a spare roll of tickets, I was expecting to have to come up with
a clever blag, but the guy just said "Yeah." and gave me them!!
Anyway, I now have free bus travel for life.  Oh, yeah, almost forgot,
to get that lovely jagged edge that tickets normally have, use a pair of
pinking shears (sort of crinkle-cut scissors used for cutting fabric.)

Easier thing would be to surely to get someone who IS VAT registered
to buy your good for you through his/her own company and then claim
the VAT back for himself, they can then write small assets like that
off.

If it's a new computer system the VAT man may ask to see it when he next
checks your books and if you haven't got it then he'll wanta see the sales
receipt from when you sold it and of course if your vat registered you
have to charge vat when you sell it. The best way to avoid the vat is too
find a small dealer and go and see him with a fist full of dollars.

childish twat kind of way).  So me and a few mates rang them up loads
of times and they wouldn't tell us what company they were, all we got
was "This is a private business line." or "I'm not obliged to tell you
that."  I'm getting really pissed off and want to know who they are.
Anyone got any ideas?  Maybe the're the secret service or something....
Hmmmmm.

Hi there!
You could try adopting a more subtle approach, using a polite well
groomed sort of accent, make out that you are from a company trying
to sell them something, or maybe your from BT engineering department
carrying out tests on the line, and checking records :-> , possibly
you could be from the directory enquiries dept. checkin rekords again
be imaginative and subtle, and ya will get the suckers eventually.
If the person on the end of the fone is a real cow you could
try your anonymous caller / husband is shagging round routine.
loads a poss.

Flash, I dont know about 0800 100 100 being the "Secret Service", however
I did discover a 0800 dialup for the FBI a few years back. Imagine my
surprise when I dialed a number at random and heard "FBI Headquarters" in
an American accent. Quite a good cure for constipation I can tell you. Did
anyone bother to write this number down anywhere?

HA HA HA! This afternoon I phoned 0800 100 100.  Heres a transcript.

Telephonist-"0800 100 100?"
Me-"Hello, I'm from British Telecom, the directory enquires dept. (Great
idea Zak! :-D)....We seem to have a problem with our records, all I need
to know is the name of the comany that this line is registered to."
Telephonist-"It's Shell Homeline."
Me-"O.K. Thanks, you've been very helpful. <Grin>"
Telephonist-"...Click,Brrrrrr"
Me-"Bye bye."
Telephonist-"Brrrrrrrr"
Me-"Oh, she hung up...bitch."

O.K., Now I knew the name of the company.  So I thought "Hmmm, Shell,
that's th petrol station isn't it.".  So my mate called and complained
that a Shell petrol pump had given him deisel instead of petrol and
damaged his engine.  The telephonist said that the line was only for
something to do with ordering petrol and not for compaints.

Why the fuck did they want to keep that secret??  Ooooh, it makes me
maaaaad!

I tried calling 0800 891 1269, Cherokee said that this was a dialup for
the FBI.  But all I got was that crap tone you get when you dial a
non-existant number.  Are you sure that was the right number?  Maybe
they've changed it.

 Title: Operators
  From: Flash [172]
  Time: Mon Jan 17 00:55:11 1994
Me and a mate were dialling random 0800 89x xxx numbers and we got an
AT&T operator who seemed to think that we were calling from the
something plaza hotel.  We asked her to make a collect call to an
American number we'd made up and gave her a fake name.  We heard her
call the number and some guy picked it up.  He said he'd never heard of
us and wouldn't take the call. So my mate started crying and said "But
you said you loved me, how can you do this to me?? (Boo Hoo, Sob)".
You should have heard the guys voice "You definately go a wrong number
buddy" and he slammed down the phone.  So my mate started saying "I
think I'll just end it all, life's just not worth living anymore", the
operator was shitting herself.  HO HO, how we laughed!
Anyway, we don't know the number we dialled, so does anyone know of any
0800 or 0500 dialups where you get an American operator?

IF 0800 100 100 was something more 'important other than a shell petrol
ordering service', dont you think they would of changed to a differnt
number? They must receive quite a few calls every day, by some curious

I called 0800890999 and asked the BT guyon the other end why I could no
longer break Hawaii, he said he didnt know but to call back during the
week and that once of their techinications would know. I had threewated
him onto the party line so everyone was listening ... I mean, BT helping
with boxing what next! AT&T giving us calling cards ?! ... Also Phant that
Merc numba is in Russia, its a contruction comapny in Russia using Merc
run by British people (highland guy and an English guy), breakable but
only every so-often :> ... Using a bit of pink noise ... Catcha L8r.

This is 0800-282871. Its 2400,7E1. When you connect it does nothing for a
while. Then asks if you have a printer attached to the terminal. After
that
it pumps loads of control codes on the screen and gives some of the stuff
below. I've removed most of the ansi rubbish. I've tried ANSI, VT52 and
VT100 and it still doesn't like it. Anyway, the majority of the text is
below.

  From: Harlequin [99]

OK, here are a couple of numbers I've found while scanning 0800282xxx
(so far). The first seems to be a UNIX system (kEwL). With username/
password inputted as guest/guest you get asked for a second
'Dialup Password'.
The second number wants a dial-back password... This does seem to
suggest caller-id, but it's more likely that it'll ask you for your
number once you've cracked the passwd. Anyway...

  Yah..get root on one internet sun then do a rpcinfo -p sitename
on the site u wanna hack - if you see theyre running mountd then
do a showmount -e on them.  If they export any filesystems to
(everyone) or the site you're on, then you can do the following:

  yoursite% mkdir /.example
  yoursite% mount site.you.wanna.hack:exported_filesystem /.p
  yoursite% cd /.example

and then phuck about with the files in there, it's as if they were on your
filesystem.  N.b. some sites export stuff read-only :(  (although that can
be handy), if they export anyone's home directory writeable (finger comes
in handy here) then u can just write a + + .rhosts file and rsh straight
in.

     This return call I got - It called me back, like, a couple of minuted
after I hung up so I shouldn't imagine it's anything to do with not
hanging up properly. I wasn't scared really, I just wondered. Also my dad
got some kind of strange call today - We were out so someone took a msg
but it read:
BT phone to tell you the number: 0800 243120.
They also said to ring back about the telephone account.

Not sure what that means yet but I'll find out when I phone tomorrow.

  Time: Thu Jan 13 22:13:41 1994
I've obtained a few empty boxes on an 0800 VMB system but they're gonna
need a bit of work - Does anyone know how to get some systems to allow you
to receive messages when you don't as standard ? If someone tried to leave
me mail you hear my greeting then it just stops.... If you try to send
someone else on the system mail you get the proper "Leave message after
the beep" announcement. For some reason no-one can send me mail. Maybe
it's because it's a new box and needs to be verified by the system manager
or something ?

Also there is no option once inside to send other boxes mail. If this will
help identify the system the promprs are:
- 2 For administrative options
- 3 To change greetings
- 5 To leave box

Administrative options lets you change pwd and prompting level.

Any ideas ?

Hmm.....found a merdian/express VMB the other day.....(0271 388 000)
nex consecutive numbers ask for 'Prompt Maintenance. Menu ID?'
doesnt seem to like any amount of numbers entered.....
can these be disabled/not set up?
any way of setting them externally?
388 001 trys to transfer to an operator but cant find one available...

I hacked a PBX personally a few years back on 0800-891-798. This was a
company in New York called 'Interpayment'. If you pressed '000' you could
get an outside line which would allow you to call global. I guess they
suspected something was wrong when their phone bill arrived in a box.

Pyro Man, the best method of obtaining PBX's is to dial a number range in
sequence and make a note of all automated answering systems. Now you
can go back through the list one at a time and try to access an outside
line. Most systems nowdays require more than pressing '9' followed by the
number, however you will be surprised at how stupid some people are.

Yes, there was a PBX on 0800 220255 which gave a recorded announcement.
If you then dialled *0*9 you would be given a dialling tone and could then
dial anywhere!!!

I found a PBX that would give you dialling tone if you hit the # key as
they were giving you a message. The system was on night service, so try
this on some information lines in the US, when a message tells you that
they are closed etc, trying confusing the system, you never know you luck,
I do!....I'll be back with some numbers for you to try and explain how I
used to get on one.....Jono

bah, try erm...1800-436-4801 codeline run by a guy called Paradox that I
met on IRC...its pretty lame usually but sometimes he posts useful
things...btw...not the place but what the fuck is 0800 891898? gives you a
tone like a loop/bridge and it IS multinode but you cant hear if you try
to speak over it....is it a muted loop or just a tone test or what???

900s you need a pbx, for 800`s just ask the inward B12ac121C to connect
you to it, if she says she cant or whatever, just tell her you are
receiving a network failure on that number...
