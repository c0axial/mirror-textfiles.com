Can anyone donate a 50 or 60mb SCSI hard drive to the system? We are now
running with less than 1mb spare and I dont want to take the system down.

I am sure someone must have a spare SCSI drive which they no longer
require.

rumours are that at&t will be with us by the end of 1993 so where will
this lead us?
well i hear a lot of people talking about the good ole at&t card dying etc
as bt will then comunicate with them and give permission to trace back
card users etc so thats a disadvantage but things arent always one way.how
about the bridges,pbx`s,sys 75,85g3i,85g3r`s and lots to explore on their
new freephone dialups,like mercury they will have a frephone code.
so looks like we will be getting less sleep than before a totally new area
to explore in .
i think this may be a thought for most people but i assure you i would
like to be first to get into there central computer over here...!

When I think of a police officer trying to say a plant that is several
times older than man is illegal I nearly piss myself with after.
Getting philosophical for a moment, I can and will do anything I want to
do anytime I want. There is no such thing as natural law. All things are
the same. Its ridiuclous that smack addicts have to go around stealing and
costing police time and money to get a fix of impure expensive shite, when
they could be giving the same by the government for a couple of pence and
do community service to pay for it. Save stealing. Save impurity and
dangeroud cuts. Give junkies something to do and let them get on with it.
As you say, your business is none of mine or anyone elses...
FUck em...

                             -Computer Melvins-

A computer Melvin is one who:

Is either under 5 feet tall or over 6 feet tall, not weighing over 100 pounds.

Buttons his shirt all the way up, until his face is blue.

Has zits that glow in the dark.

Has Bi-focals by the age of 12.

Wears Kangaroo shoes.

Falls on his face, whenever a girl walks within 20 feet.

Jacks his pants up all the way up to his neck.

Cares more about which DOS to use than what clothes to wear.

Watches Dr. Who every Sunday at 11, and thinks K-9 is the greatest.

Carries his books with both hands.

Attacks flies.

Has a pet frog.

Goes to CLC.

Speaks Chinese.

Tucks in their regulation P.E. shirt, and wears matching brown socks.

Thinks personal hygiene is a word processor.

Has keep out signs on his door.

Has not been able to open his locker since 5th grade.

Boasts to girls how much "k" his computer has.

Drops nickels in disk drives.

Has every single game created by man, and paid for them all.

People call him a geek, he thinks it's a compliment.

Can convert every number into Hexa-decimal, and then into binary, in his head.

Favorite movie is the Karate Kid.

Is around as social as a skunk.

Has a password to gain entrance to every one of his disks.

Uses their computer on Friday and Saturday nights.

Brings a Flip 'n' File 50's to school.

Watches GI Joe on channel 9, every weekday at 3:30.

Trying to pass someone in Driver's Ed will shift to 'P' thinking it means pass.

Has a Micro-modem II or even worse, a Networker.

When typing "RUN HELLO" puts "RUN HELLO,D1,S6,V254"

When saving a program, always puts secret control codes in them.

Starts their own BBS or AE line on the only phone line they have in their house.



Has a Commadore 64 or a Vic 20, and swear there the best.

Has an ATARI computer and a modem that plugs into to joy port#2.

If 1 to 5 of these apply, there is still hope; unplug your computer for one
month, if you can do this you may still live a normal life.

If 6 to 10 of these apply, complete cold turkey is necessary to salvage what's
left of your life.

If 11-20 of these apply, you are a complete loser, at most you have 1 friend and


he probably fits in this category too, start thinking what sanitarium you want
to go to.

If 21-30 of these apply, you care about nothing and nobody, you stand out in a
crowd like an elephant in an ant farm.  You were probably admitted to a
sanitarium and escaped.  Beware of the people!

If 31-36 of these apply, you are positively a complete vegetable, if you can
talk it's probably in short beeps and rings. If any of these kind of people do
exist, and you see em, the best thing to do would be to point a 22 gauge
shotgun at their head and pull the trigger. Put them out of their misery.

LEECH (Leach); n; A person who takes all the programs, text philes, or any
      thing else that goes on a disk, that he can, without giving anything
      in return. ---The Webster's Computer Crime Dictionary, 1985 ed.
      (coming soon to an AE line near you!)

Leeches are:
-------People who call up an AE or Catsend and take EVERYTHING on it.
-------And don't upload.
-------People who call BBS's and read EVERY message on there.
-------And don't post
-------Then head straight for the G-Philes
-------And read all they can within the time limit
-------They then call back and get MORE.
-------And MORE
-------And MORE
-------People in school who TELL you to give th{em your newest.
-------When they don't have anything to give in return.
-------Except Super Deluxe Tax-Man VI
-------AE sysops who have 4 drives full of "U/L here!"
-------BBS sysops who tell you to U/L to get your security level raised
-------When they have nothing to offer at the higher levels
-------People who don't write their own text philes
-------People who say, "Anyone have a cheat for..." repeatably
-------People who see phreak codes on a board and use them to death
-------Without hacking out their own.
-------People who see your latest on a "New Warez" board and ask you to GIVE
       them the programs and they'd be forever grateful...
-------People who come over your house, copy everything you have, and say,
       "Oh, look how late it is! I have to go!"
-------People who work out an AE/Catsend trade, get the game you send them,
       and hang up.
-------Note: THEY always call YOU in the first place and you don't have their
       fone number!
-------Someone who trades by mail and never sends his stuph.
-------People who say they have the newest when all they do is call AE's
       all day and D/L everything they have time for.
-------Your "dad's friend's son" who doesn't know shit about computers
-------Basically, anyone who doesn't C O N T R I B U T E to a BBS, AE,
       Catsend or WHATEVER. Leeching is the #2 sin, remember...besides
       being 13 years old! So...----> DON'T BE A LEECH! <----
-------[Note: this is not a leech...it is an asshole] Anyone who changes the
       names of authors of text philes! It's ok to but your board's name up
       there, but DON'T change the author's name! It's against the law!
       (of course, that never stops us...). So PLEASE, don't do this!

If you do ANY of the above, then stop immediately! In the computer crime
social scale, leeches are ranked lower than Melvins! (scary thought isn't
it?). So if you have any of those habits, stop them AT ONCE! You will
be doing the entire computer underground a favor!

**************************************************************************

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were "free".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is "low":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No "phone stores" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Would anyone happen to have a Commodore 64 compatible modem (preferably
2400 and Hayes compatible but will consider others) ? If the answer is
yes, either leave me a message or send mail to PELOQUIN BEASTIE on my
board, Spider's Lair.

Check Micro Computer Mart for a cheap 2400bps modem. You should
find one for about 40 pounds. Although you may have to build a RS232
interface like the one advertised in Maplin.

Nah Ada 9X isn't finished yet - I keep checking New York uni for it but
they haven't put any news up on it yet.

ajpo Hmmmm yer its a bit one-sided though - being the validators etc.

What I want is an Ada compiler for the PC and any libraries anyone has. It
*MUST* be 'VALIDATED' though. Is Meridian validated to the last standard?

What do you mean: 'misfortune'??? I think Ada is fantastic - certainly
better than C and PASCAL in many respects. Anyways please let me know on
the Ada for MS-DOS. I may be able to get IntegrAda which looks good but
not for a while and it beats remote compilation and use etc.

Cheers

I have had the bad misfortune of programming in ADA for the last 2 years.
I use Meridian ADA 3.0 , and HALO_ADA (Graphics stuff)
Can you get ADA 9X? Is it out yet?
Anyway, if you have access to FTP, here is the main address for stuff :-
ajpo.sei.cmu.edu
got more addresses if anyone wants them.

Noticed you are coding govt./aerospace spec. software so I guess you must
be using Ada if it's to be certified etc.

Do you know of a PD Ada for MS-DOS other than AX9 and the educational ones
etc.? I've tried comp.lang.ada etc....no luck and FAQlists on Ada - they
seem to say just Augusta is available....

Thanks
