Is someone on here responsible for this P/H-UK mag ? I saw a call for
submissions somewhere for a magazine containing UK-specific info. No
handles were mentioned etc, just an anonymous e-mail address.
Interested to know who's involved.

I believe that if Meekos board(urban xtc) was 24 hours, he would not be
in this situation. [Hint Phantasm :)]
