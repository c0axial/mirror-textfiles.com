Here are some VMB'S to play around wiv

0800 800600 - National Breakdown, try mailbox 1234#  
passcode 1234# 

0800 551188 - The AA, Try mailbox 1234# no passcode

0800 919929 - IBM, All ya need is the id try 1# 2# 3#

0800 232232 - Golden Wonder, This one aint a VMB but if you
try user code 0000 you can do a lot of weird phings with it

0800 665500 - Escom Direct, Mailbox 3244# passcode 3244#

0800 550550 - RAC, Mailbox 1111 havn't hacked the passcode yet

0800 100600 - TNT, Dont know if this one is a VMB but when you
press the # key it asks you for a 7 fig passcode

01926 464xxx - These are mainly IBM VMBs but some other interesting 
phings around, possibly an IBM internet server but i'm too lazy 
(and tight) to scan them all

To get into these either try # or 81 .To get into some others you 
need to key in any numba then it asks you to record a message
when the message is recording press * and then your in.

Well thats it, if you do get hack any of the ones i havn't
hacked yet tell me, oh and have phun!!!

 I was told by Tas that there were over 10 wayz 2 dial out of a
meridian vmb system,I'm a little bit doubtfull of this statement as I
sure as hell don't know 10 ways....perhaps I've got a load of meridian
systems that I could of been abusing without even knowing about it.
 Can anybody set me strait and tell me all the ways there r to dial
out.
