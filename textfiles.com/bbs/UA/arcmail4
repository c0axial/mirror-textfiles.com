Well it looks like 971 has died (sob) but there *is* still a way to
call the USA. All I know is this:
It doesn't use standard (i.e. CCITT5) breaks and there are 2 0800s you
can box off.
I reckon they're R2 tones and I suspect 0800890038 is one of them, but
I can't get the bugger to break. I called the op and said 'I am BT
engineer etc etc Have you had any1 calling and hanging up recently cos
we think we have a fault on the linez...' She said two interesting
things...
a) We don't know which country the caller is dialling from as they
answer home country directs from holland,UK,germany etc etc and
b) There has been some     JV'kids' calling and hanging up recently...
Hmmmmm.....

Global routes : My guess is that it would be outside of 0800-890, and I
don't see why it would have to be in 0800 aswell, what about 0500 ?
When I get time I'm going to have a proper search as I've been given a

down, busts happen. Personally I'm gonna be *very* careful and I
advise everyone else to do the same. This may be just paranoia, but its
healthy paranoia, and hell its good practice.
Mosts busts happen cos of CC fraud and other 'tangeble' crimes. Hacking
is a bit of a wishy washy charge. However, they had nicked the 'Black

Try KP1 - x101    where x is btwn 1 - 9

 In the middle of doing a complete KP1 scan at the mo. so ill chuck

BTW this will probably be a lame-arsed question..but ill ask anyway...
would it not be possible to break the line of an internal trunk in
trinidad...and then dial off that using trinidads CCITT
reccomendations?
   Any ideas anyone....

R BT! tracing your calls, well the answer is YES!!! BT is tracing the
0800 numbers. Several companies from abroad have complained that either
their numbers are being used for "Defraudment" or thet they are being
used for, "Unauthorised Access". This includes the VMB's, Telnet's and
such stuff, the companies that have complained that they are losing
money through this "defraudment" have been given permission to apply
traces to their lines, although from the information I received I do
not know whether a prosecution can be made from the trace??? 
 
BT are DEFINITELY investigating their international 0800 numbers,
whether or not they can prosecute is another matter?? I will try to
find out more even as I type this message. BT are also aware that
several PBX's are being "abused" and that following investigation a
prosecution may or may not follow. Do not be fooled by the text files
that say that all this is bollox, because BT have to do something, I do
not think they are going to let people "abuse" their systems, fuck
knows why but still :) Any more information I do get will be posted
here!!!!!

Hi , BT are probably tracing certain things, but according to the
BT terms and conditions it is the companies resonsibilty if they want
to use 0800's. If they were wise they would have there PBX's on a local
call number like 0345.

It's obvious that they will get problems having an 0800 number and BT
will just say that is up to you, they may try and trace some, but it
will be one hell of a job and you are percectly legal to call 0800's
and leave a message on someones mailbox.

Still ... Be sensible and all will be ok, but don't start getting
paranoid, that can sometimes go against you. Keep phreaking, read mu
file BUST_BT!, at the worst you may loose you phone line and equipment,
but then you just say sorry and get it back again <g>.

The last 2600 meeting re-inspired me to continue my feeble
attempts at boxing. What's the score  regarding boxing the states
now ?  I used to be able to KP2+10+NUMBER+ST but I now get
the dreaded  three tones and message to call the international
operator (on 1 5 5). Have the routing codes been changed, if so
where can I begin looking for the new ones ?

I found that you can scan for them by dialing slowly and waiting for
the aforementioned message to find out which number was not
acceptable...  but this is VERY slow.

Also, what can be done with KP1. According to Welch, some transit
exachanges are one and the same as the receiving exchanges, in whach
case, can you make inland calls ?

Finally, the old question...how safe is doing this from home ?
So far, myself and a couple of friends have done quite a lot of playing
about with C5 tones and so far no hassle - is this just to lull us into
a flase sense of security  ???

Sorry if these questions seem extremely 'lame' but I'm a bit of
a fledgling...

Yes you can use KP1 on certain lines to make inland calls. I wouldn't 
bother with the old lines we used to use KP2-10-num-ST off since
they're thoroughly overscanned. Start looking for new lines to break.
 
I also noticed that you could slowly digit but digit and scanned out a
few numbers which don't seem to get you anywhere except to some HCD
that you can reach off 0800-890 direct numbers anyway.
 
Don't take my word for it but I wouldn't have thought there'd be much
danger in messing with C5.

Anyway when i call trinidad and break/seize where actually

so i presume im back at a 0800 exchange, no???
Anyway whot r ya thoughts on this one
Phone up 0800899843 box to some other coutry (eg, on those porn lines)
say Iraq (teehee), can you then break and seize the lines using
different tones to break/seize tthe last country (ie, Iraaq),
while the Trinidad trunk is nott affected.

As i say this may all be common knowledge, and im just thick
as fuck, but is a Q thats been bugging me for a while
have had a play around with different tones, but can only seem to
break the line, ie end up hanging around with out been able to shit

Sieze with 2600Hz for 500ms
 
This will call anywhere, but always responds with the busy signal.

etc, etc... there are many other international countries which can

Yeah, but they lack some features, like having 100 instead of 200
name/number memories (a real useful feature :))

yeah, the Orange call waiting and shit is quite good for a portable as

Come the revolution, every man will have a new mini metro and a
portable fone of his choice. Women will be put back in their place and
all council officials will be flogged in public. (Dunno how much for
though). By then possibly Orange will have crept past watford and be
almost into the midlands.

OK, I don't know whether or not this is any use but I've been
experimenting
with 0800 899843. First you seize and send the number to connect to.
Wait
for the connection and then you can seize using a 2040hz and 2400hz
tone
together. Just send it for a second or so. I think that the line must
be
silent or something because I have only managed to seize 1- when it
first
beeps to signal a connect and 2- when there is no voice on the other
end.
   
I haven't had any luck dialling after the seize yet. NOTE you can still
reseize using the usual tones. I think that perhaps I am seizing the
gyana
trunk (not the Trinidad trunk as usual). BTW I read that the 204 400
seize
tone is used in Kenia, Uganda etc. so theres a pretty good chance that
it is
a valid seize tone.

That's what I had assumed... I was thinking of setting up a timer chip
to an 8kHz frequency then waitiing for a change of state in the data
and firing the chip off... then just monitoring it and watching the
bits. Inverted data ain't a problem as you say... I just hope I won't
lose too many packets due to flipping in the middle.
Thanks.

PhoneDisk is a CD ROM of the published UK phone directory.
It is available from BT - and also maybe elsewhere.
It works fibne on PCs, but I am trying to write software to read
and display the information on an Arxchimedes
The names, adresses & hone numbers are stropred in 2 known files.
Unfortunately the information is heavily enciphered or encoded.
BT is less than helpful in informing me how to decipher these files.
I feel that someone out there may either know how to decode the
information, or be able to tell me how I could find this out, or
point me in the direcgtion of the source file of the EXE PC program
analysis of which could provide me with the clues.

   Hi there Phr3akers ,

   If you had tried to box a line from Trinidad last night then you
will
   have found that it didn't work , well , they havn't actually stopped
us ,
   th have just changed the routing codes.

   The number to dial the 5921010 chatline used to be :

         KP2  59211010  ST but it is now  KP2  15921010 ST

   stead of dialin the '1' after the '+2' it goes before it.
   If the old routing code had any other number after the '+592' then
miss
   it out but still put a '1' in front.

   We found this out at about 10:20 AM this morning (Saturday 10TH Dec
1994)
   and I have checked the other numbers and they all work with the new
   routing code ......

   Cya l8r......

the 0 in area codes ie. 0506 becomes 01506 . When will this come into
effect (I know it works at the moment but when does the old system
become defunct)? Why did they do this anyway?

I was messing around on the 0800899843 number and i came across the
routing A1109 which took me to a port of spain inward. I bullshitted
him for a bit (i'm bt, the usual crap) and he told me that the routing
for the UK was 0144767 . I can't get this to work - maybe he was just
shittin me but i also found the same guy on B0101 and B0109 and A1101.
I found some tones and silence on B0108 , B0102 , B0100 and B0103. If
anyone can get any further please post !

they use the numbers badly.  erm for your info.  most vmb outdials that
wont accept 141 will also need to be modified after the change as the
01 code is currently blocked on the aspens anyway :)

More bad news guys... I have just heard that 'RAVEN' has also been
busted. Yesterday two local CID officers, a BT fraud investigation
officer and another CID officer confiscated all his hardware and
took him for questioning. This seems to be linked with the PBX/VMB
phreaking which I mentioned in a warning message in General Mail.
 
Another possibility is that he may have been linked with the recent
bust of 'ROTOX' since his name and other details are thought to have
been stored on ROTOX's personal organiser.
 
More details will be posted as they become available,

Well, it's April 1st (no joke). Not all STD just add a 1 after the 0,
there are five that change totally, also some towns go from 6 digit to
7 digit local numbers at the same time. Here in Hull all 5 digits
numbers get a 3 put infront of them to put them up to 6 digits. Also
all VMB/PBX outdials, call-barring equipment, phone memories etc. will
also have to be altered (some needs the use of an engineer). Call
barring equipment must be altered by March 1994 (well gone...). Thing
like all your stationary, fax machine ID numbers etc. etc. All this
bcuz BT are a bunch of idiots who can't count... Hell, the Yanks beat
us at something else - a decent dialing system (10 digits fixed).

Er, no and stuff. They may have 10 digits fixed but their area codes
are very restricted, and what happens when Trinidad and all of the
other 809 numbers want their own area codes? Much confusion...
Read phreak90.txt it has lots of stuff about numbering systems.

                        ESN READER MODIFICATION
                        BY WIRE HEAD
                        OF THE N.Y.H.E.

                *****************************************************


        Here's the problem: Range, or lack of it !!!
        Solution: Increase the sensitivity by either
        1. Adding a RF front end or
        2. Patching the IF from a scanner to the IF in the reader.

        This article will address the second method because it does
        not require any test equipment to make it work. The mod will
give
        the reader about a 2-3 mile range or more with an outside
antenna.
        The ESN readers were not designed to be very sensitive and
require
        a little help to make them work better.
        
        Parts list:
        ESN reader (Curtis or Wavetek)
        Pro-2006 scanner (any scanner with 800 Mhz will do)
        Some shielded audio cable
        2 - .05 uf caps
        2 - audio jacks 
        1 - audio patch cable (match to the jacks)

        The following assumes you have some experience with soldering
and
        electronic know how. If you don't know what you're doing than
find
        someone (you trust) that does. 
        
       In the Pro-2006, restore 800 mhz by cutting diode D502 on the
front
        vertical board (you can't miss it). On other scanners look
around
        for the mods on the BBS's. In the pro-2006 locate IC2, TK10420.
        IC2 is the NFM demodulator chip. On other scanners look for the
        455 kHz filter. It will usually say 455 somewhere on it.
Connect the
        cap to either side of the filter. In the pro-2006 solder a .05
cap
        to pin 3, the 455 kHz IF mixer output. Now we must get this IF 
        signal to the outside of the unit. You can either drill a hole
in
        the back and install an audio plug or convert the earphone jack

        like I did. Solder the center wire on the shielded cable to the
        jacks tip and the shield to the ring. Solder the other ends
center
        wire to the cap on pin 3. That's it for the scanner.

      Now in the rder, locate th NE605/615 chip and solder a .05 cap to

        pin 20, the 455 kHz IF mixer output. Do the same hookup here
with
        the jack and shielded cable and drill a hole for the jack. 
        The reader will not need the antenna hooked to it while
connected
        to the scanner. Hook up an antenna to the scanner and program
in
        the following freqs: 834.390 to 835.620 in 30 kHz steps, these

Yeah I know that you ascii posted it, you just forgot to post the
credits that were in the original phile :( Doesn't really matter
now I suppose... but what about your other files? Your Mercury
file was basically a copy of an old phile called MERCURY.TXT.
Have you actually tried anything that you suggested in that phile
out? Scanning Mercury etc.? Anyway, your Trinidad routing codez
were very familiar to a scan done by Violator/Apocalypse.
I dunno who copied but check out the philez (I think his is called
TRINIDAD.TXT) they're IDENTICAL!! And your phile tb-xmas.txt was
strange.. You made it sound as if your just needed card details when
you actually need real plastic. And the machine can check the card
details, theres a coms cable at the back...
 
On the plus side, your local net access phile was good, even if the
info is available in other philez, it was nice to see it all collected
together.
 
Sorry about accusing you of writing tb-out.txt. I still think you
shouldnt have released his pri8 details, couldnt you think of something
more imaginative?.. pri8 stuff should remain so.

ummm, it shouldn't be too difficult, cause phones are at a relatively
high voltage (perhaps only when in use), so you could use 9v appliances
at a fair current. (need to consult a physics teacher sometime :))

no, what I mean is, you get the 50V from the phone line (small current)
and use a transformer to step it down to around 9v, thus increasing the
current proportionally. Your are still only getting a small current
from the phone line, so wahat's impossible about that?

Have measured the voltatge. It's 50v (approx.) when it is not in use
(D), but rises to around 90V AC upon rings. To get the 50v D into a
useable crrent, you'ld need to get a chip from maplin (something
that'll take a variable voltage feither AC or D between 40v and 100v,
sorry, can't remember part number), then route that into a tranformer
to increase the current, decrease the voltage to maybe power your modem
or summit. I can handle the theory , but not the practical side of
things, so if you wanna try it out. oh, the Maplin part costs around 20
quid I think, plus extra for a tranformer.         ^^^^ chip that is.

Greetings,

Has anyone had any luck in using the Spytrak software with a 4800X. 
I've got a couple of plans, but pin 25 on the LPT1: plug is causing me
problems.  Anyone got it working properly, and what plans are you using

Anyway, whilst I'm here, for a few of you ESN hunters, I always find
this an easy way - Walk into your nearest phone shop and hangaround
the sales desk reading contracts, and peoples pairs of the side of the
boxes as their being shown a phone.  It at lesast means you've got a
fresh one :-)

Anyway, if you do use SpyTrak / 4800x monitoring software, lemme know.

no use hacking it wiht a modem, anyway just thought you might be
interested.

yup, most of the boxable lines use c5. I dunno of any lines using r2,
trouble is r2 was designed to be unboxable, cos the seize tone is
3825hz which is too high for normal operations. The only thing u could
try is using r2 on any lines which u break, and if it responds then
u've
found an r2 line that hasn't got the proper master tone for some reason
(like it cant be transmitted via some routes why? cos its too high
freq!)

     Hmm, I've seen several windows programs - I *think* one of 'em was
a box prog.  They're on my board, I'll call it up and check to see for

HAs anyone got anywhere with blueboxing recently...I found this weird
no thats a modem line but I think it also seizes-0800 898 804 you have
to wait for it to answer first and the carrier noise is a bitch to
send the seize noise over.
also i managed to seize bolivia today using the same breaks as used
when boxing was still good..only managed it once though.
If anyone could advise me on break frequencies id be grateful,currently
im using 2400/2600-150ms and 2400-70ms with pink noise too as without
pink noise the liones just lock up for me,is this the best way?

Try these out:

BT Operator (Mercury Routing) : 0500-500-453
I dont think the Operator routing is still operative, but you can try
anyway. Advantage being that the 0500 will bypass the payphone warning
mechanism that alerts the operator to the fact that you are calling
from a payphone, and you can just bill direct to the telco, or if you
live on a UXD5b exchange, have one of your enemies pick up the tab.

Can anyone shed some light on this? Ive found a number on my local

sopunds 1633hz continuously for five seconds, and then drops the line.
Its not a loop, and I cant get it to accept any signalling. I reckon
its possibly for line decibel loss testing, but why use 1633? Surely
2713hz and 1004hz are quite adequate for Loopback and decibel testing?

phones and then taking the sim card out and just egetting sim cards him
self (legit ones) and selling the phone properly...there is a guy near
me doing that..he makes a nice profit because he gets his commision
from vodaphone/cellnet/orange and he does not have to buy the phone...i

If you heard about stealth then you would not try it....they came
noticed his bill because the people that put the bills in the post look
at them before they go...and if they notice like loads of 0800's they
report it...also what makes them look at your account is if there is
lots of orders for three-way and call waiting and complaints of people
trying to get information on your account....the people at the fraus

Well.. I would say there MUST be some interesting lines somwhere that
would be of use,I expect Dr.Fonk knows ;) As for scanning 0800's..
well..I have scanned plenty from my home line,and I have never been
contacted.. and I know other people that have done the same and they
havn't been contacted either.. as for PBX's.. well.. if you use a BT
PBX then you are asking for trouble.. but if you are using a companies
PBX (not a BT one) then you are a LOT more safe.. I have used plenty of
non BT PBX's in the past and not been contacted so.. all I can say is
stay clear of BT..

line...this is what i did..  nicked an electric shaver thing and cut
the 2 wires...then opened up the fone socket and shuved it on all the

ring...it was not like normal xxx xxx it was xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx so i
held it there for about 1 min and then it stopped as i lifted my head i
could like see there was a small ligh in the phone....and then i could
smell smoke...the phone was on fire...and the one on the extension
as well..it was like really cool..and then the person that called the
phone went next door to ask if he could borrow the phone...but he
couldnt because it didnt work!!! so he went down the road...and it
didnt work...basically i took out all the phones in the street
8)....and the next morning nio the way to werk as driving out the
street i could see 5 british telescum vans outside that little green
box thing...and they were there at 5:15 when I came home...and they
said it was a lighning volt at the exchange...8)  it took all of the
fuses out and everything...luck it did not travel any further or it
