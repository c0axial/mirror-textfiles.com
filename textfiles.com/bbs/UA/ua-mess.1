Kixx you have gone and won the |_ /\ |\/| 3 R of the year award with the
following message, a lesson to all the other lamers of the so-called
HP world :
----------
When i dial a number ANY NUMBER, once the recieving end has answered,
voice or date, when i switch the fone over to PULSES not TONES, and press
1 then i get another dial tone, when i get this tone i hang up, then
IMIDIATLY the person who i first called then dials back AUTOMATICKLY and
we start when i hung up on... Do ya know what i mean?
I dial the number firstly using TONES on my fone, when i get an answer i
switch to PULSES and get another dial tone, then i hang up, and the other
end that i first dialed calls me back!!!!! It's shit hot! Dunno who the
fuck pays for the call once I get called tho, somebody else try it out and
tell me what it is, coz i aint gotta clue... Also, when u get the second
dial tone u cannot dial another number out of it, after pressing a few
numbers a message comes up saying 'Sorry u have dialed incorectly, u will
be re-connected to the otherline' .... well WIERD! anybody know what it
is?

You sure aint got a clue, I though Phantasm deleted the lame ones ?
Oh well, maybe you just slipped through the net. The above is being printed
and put on my wall so when I am feeling down I can read it and have a good
laugh and say to myself "There are people much-more lame that me!".

Matty, are you competing with Kixx for lamer of the millenium ?
------------
O.K. here it goes,
What you need is a very nice person with 3 - way calling on their
phone.  You get them to set up a three way call with you and any U.S.
number you require.  When all three are connected, the very nice person
with 3 - way calling hangs up!!!!  Do you get this so far???  And then
no-one is being charged for the call!!
Easy as Converting Base 4 numbers to Base 13!!
--------------
And when the person with 3-way hangs up the call dies and everyone is cut
off unless the opt to transfer the control to another caller but THEY still
have to pay for the call. The amount of lamers on this board is getting bad
time for some deletions Phantasm ... Wheres the real phreaks ? 
Scojack / Grim Reaper / Boots / Maelstrom / Eck / Phantasm / AC / Datastream
etc ?

SJC, dont be a wank ...

This is not so.  The routings have changed due to phone day, which is
supposed to bring us in line with europe.  Blue boxing has F.A. to do woth
it.....  So I will keep trying to find the new codes.
----
Has it fuck, the country codes arnt changing, 1 is still USA, 44 is still
UK ... Get a clue ?

george king/sjc: it aint the phoneday thingy at all, Bt stopped it coz to
many poeople were boxing to the Uk, that is why it died, they have been
changing data and blocking out codes (as A BT bloke explained) so it is
unlikly you will be able to box at all from the old numbers
-------------
I have large feeling you are one of 3 people I know :>
BT are just full of shit, as you know you were on 3-way when I got BT
Fag to admit the data changes and code blocking on that Wednesday and he
said they would be done quickly, they did 4 hours to kill USA->UK boxing.

 I have spoken to someone pretty senior within the BT establishment and
they confirmed that a software change and/or some sort of filter was
placed on the lines to stop boxing. The reason, he told me, was that after
the channel 4 program the instances of blueboxers skyrocketed and they
felt that it had to be stopped.
 However, he is getting some engineers to find some other routs for me to
... some BT engineers working on a way round boxing for me.
Basically they know everything about all these countries phone
exchanges, so it shouldn't take that long.
-----
Well they wont have much luck and probablt will get fired.
The security surounding international exchages is phenomonal, they wont find
any codes, they may find some other shitty country operator with standard
codes but by boxing over the likes of 56/808/27 I dont think so, when BT say
no they fucking mean it, why are you engineer friends getting the info for
you personally ?
