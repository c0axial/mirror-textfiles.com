a good method of discovering valid meridian VMB accs is using the Express
service that usually goes hand in hand with Meridian VMBs.
it seems that within the VMB tel. no. range there is a service which
alows you to send msgs without all the menu shit.
after the 'Express mail...mailbox?' prompt just start entering numbers
(with following #) to find valid boxes....
hmmm...might be usefull....

specifys whether a msg was left internally or externally. is the number
that the system was called form logged?
i only ask cos i wanna set up a code line on here....

News Update: Tuesday 24-May-94 21:01:45

The Hayes Optima 28.8k modem should arrive tomorrow. I will do my best to
get everything configured and running upto 14.4k before the weekend.

Due to the fact that my serial port will not support 28.8k, this system
will probably be running on a 386/486 before the end of 1994.

 Title: hi/red boxes
  From: Tornado Of Souls [122]
  Time: Sat May 21 22:58:39 1994
hi you may have noticed im a new User sorry if I come across a bit lame
someone recently gave me these numbers ..euro space agency dissemination
centre 071 6309466 (7E1) and NASA 0101 205 895 0028 the ESA is a good
one supporting vt100 ant tty the nasa one has a modem hanging on it
but i havent verified it is actually NASA. Regarding red boxing in the
US I was wondering if /how BT signal the machine that a coin has been
inserted ? is there a similar tone system or is it completely different?
if there is a similar way to red box will the phone cut off the mouth
/earpiece untill you insert the minimum required amount like some
boxes in the states where you have to put in your dime whatever
first. I gather they eventually got round this. gotta go now im
running out of time. CHeerZ ToS

Hello Mr. Phantasm,
   If you want a *VERY* good bbs package supporting the new VFAST
standards then C-NEt (v2.35 is very good for a 500) and supports all
speeds to 192oo. I have the wb2+ version which will support the new
28.8k but you will need an A1200 because the A500 serial port can only
xfer data at 31840 which is not a valid standard!!

The best way I now of getting on to internet using CC's which ALWAYS
works is to use CIX (081-390-1255), create an account and you get
internet access until the accnt is checked!!

Yeah.. bluboxing.. fucked or just a temp setback? ..

To my  mind, if you can break the line, then with the appropriate routing
coeds, you can dail wherever.. just a question of cracking the little
fuckers! :>

Some1 suggested that KP2 +46 works for Sweded, 47 for Germany and 33(?)
for France.. can't confirm this.. tried but no joy :( ..

hi you may have noticed im a new User sorry if I come across a bit lame
someone recently gave me these numbers ..euro space agency dissemination
centre 071 6309466 (7E1) and NASA 0101 205 895 0028 the ESA is a good
one supporting vt100 ant tty the nasa one has a modem hanging on it
but i havent verified it is actually NASA. Regarding red boxing in the
US I was wondering if /how BT signal the machine that a coin has been
inserted ? is there a similar tone system or is it completely different?
if there is a similar way to red box will the phone cut off the mouth
/earpiece untill you insert the minimum required amount like some
boxes in the states where you have to put in your dime whatever
first. I gather they eventually got round this. gotta go now im
running out of time. CHeerZ ToS

This is as far as I know not correct.  The codes have changes due to B.T.
phoneday.  I have spoken to some of my contacts within B.T. and that is
what I am told..... I am also trying to find out the new international

Hi All
Blueboxing is OK, I can call the whole of Europe now! who the fuck wants
to speak to Europe, we're having enough trouble trying to join with
Europe. Well, as others have said you can still break lines and get the
tones excepted, fuck the BT engineer (even though I used to be one) he
doesn't know what here's talking about. The routing has changed due to
phone day hence all international routing has changed! ALL OF YOU WITH
LOTS OF TIME, unlike myself. use BlueBeeps Script language to hack new
codes, it shouldn't take to long, unless someone has already done it <g>
.
We have got to get back on there to make the traffic seem normal, at the
moment, they are probably wondering why it has gone so quiet after a route
change !!! so get on with it and put the fuckers at rest. YEA! ....Jono

Has anybody seen that little leaflet that comes with the phone bill?
It says that from 25th July, everyone will be given an account number
and PIN for when they call 0898 or 0338 numbers and you can charge the
calls to your account from anywhere.  So would it be poss. to find out
someones account no. and PIN and have them pay for your dirty calls?
It also says 'for a security PIN number application form, please call 0800
123 898', so would it be poss. for someone to get an account and PIN in
someone elses name?

  From: Eck [137]
  Time: Fri May 20 06:42:50 1994
BT make UNBELIVABLE ammounts of money thru blueBoxers, just think on it
4p from the country EVERY time you call the number (and the defraded
countery get the money (or a %age of the money) back from ATT who claim it
back from a part of the us govt.) NOT to mentaion all the money they get
from sell the filter THEY make to pleaces like germany... If you ask me it
would not be in BT's best intrests to skupper BlueBoxers, mabys if all of
a sudden BBing made it to the national press, then I'd watch out, but
until then as far as I can see BT are making so much money....

Here is the number for yet another company offering teleconferencing
services. Give them a call on 0800-101-610 and be ready with your VISA,
AMEX or Mastercard. I recommend calling from a payphone since you will be
called back once the other conference members are connected. You may even
book a conference in advance and get this --- have your conference
recorded on a tape. <grin>

If anyone is going to try this out, don't forget to have a false company
name and address ready. And remember to thank the nice operator for
assisting you with your enquiries. :-)

As regards BT making money on blue boxers, I was given to understand that
the foreign countries involved paid a flat rate for their line..that would
mean that NO-ONE made money out of it (or lost it either, for that
matter..) however, it seems obvious to me that they know (and have always
known) who is bbing, they just don't seem to want to prosecute for some
reason.  Perhaps it's to avoid publicity, or maybe it's a 'better the
devil you know' type situation, i.e. they can keep an eye on the guys who
are bbing rather than have someone invent a new method of phreaking that
they CAN'T keep an eye on..this would also mean that if someone released
the next internet worm, theycould go round and arrest him immediately...

  Then again, maybe that's all complete crap :) - jus speculating

  So what IS the score with BBing at the moment then?  The lines are still
seizable..from what i can gather on here BT have just 'changed the routing
codes'...is this DEFINITELY a measure to try & get rid of blue boxers?
Surely the would just have made the lines un-seizable?  If they have just
changed the codes, is it a good idea to try and scan them out again, or
can we expect a knock at the door for our troubles?  Does anyone have any
info on the possible length/format of the new routing codes?

   Can I suggest that if people are going to try and scan out the new
codes, we organise some sort of scan on here...a division of labour would
be a good idea so we can all get back to our 'hobby' asap.  Also, if only
one or two people have the new codes & start to BB, they are going to
stick out like a sore thumb..safety in numbers and all that..what do you
lot think?

Well I agree with Georges message.  We should organise our scanning
efforts.  To set the ball rolling I have found the following.
KP2 118 081 390 1244C       The 81 390 1244 bit is CIX
this gives the engaged tone
KP2 128 081 390 1244C     We are sorry your call can not be connected
also KP2 xxx where xxx is 138 148 158 198 give some results.
Can anybody improve on this.  Can anybode guess the new code format.
Blue boxing is not dead, we just need to sort the latest problem.  If we
can break the lines we are 50% of the way there. So lets get to it!!!!

Right .. Here Here !! I think that there must be a way to rout a call
through to the US ... I found out that if you dial +10176xxxxxx where
xxxxx is anything at all you get an american ring and a number
unobtainable message. Also, you can call hawaii with +10808xxxxxxx ...
not too interesting you might think but if you call a number and actually
connect (ie.8089236333) you can seizi the line again with KP. I have not
managed to get it to dial out, but I also managed to find one number in
the 808 area which will give the connecting "beep" and then a message
saying this number is not on the dial list or someting (Sorry, i forgot
the number). Then you don't have to piss people off waiting for them to
answer their phones before you can seize and try and dial out.
Keep trying everybody ! Eventually we will crack it ... L8tr

 ok as to the new routing codes this is what i have found..
 B1X176+       Bahamas
 B1X808+       hawaii
 B57X809+      Columbia
 B56X994+      Chile
 B62X178+      Philipines
 B886X133+     Taiwan
 B592X770+     Bolivia
 B27X119+      S.Africa

 interestingly the Taiwan and philipines routing can be used on
0500-890066 , on that # any other stuff gives me a recorded mesage
'this is mercury international...' .. weird..

oh and if you dont mind engineering operators a little its still easy
enough to call anywhere on the old BB.. all you have to do is find the
right operators heh..

Hmm...I think that it is a bit strange that we are still ablt to sieze the
lines. Has anyone ever actaully tried calling  "the internation operator
on 1...5...5":-) ? and asking them for the country code (well you know
what i mean - social engineering and all that...). Maybe they have to
leave the lines as siezeable so BT or whoever can use the lines for
whatever they are usually used for- otherwise wouldn't they have to put in
a whole new system? (anaotzher costly entzerprise...).

Anyway, lets all get scanning/hacking/whatever  and maybe we can come up
with something for the good of the ubnderground community :-)

Damn sure I aint payying for calls to US (or UK and anywhere else if I can

Hmmm...just had anopther thought - accoring to the sources it seems that
boxing to US was stopped before boxing to UK? Anyway, this fact combined
with the fact that the lines can stuikll be siezed suggersts to me that
indeed it boxing is still possible but only the country codes have changed
 - if you remember UK code wasn't 44 anyway so it will not have abbenm a
hasskle for them to do this (praps thats why UK wasnt 44 - a bit to
obvoius for us to find?). Well, thats my view...if you see what I mean.

Well done George !!!  I have scanned the following with no success.
KP2 0  081 390 1244 C   to KP2 330 081 390 1244 C
If you are starting at 00-200 I will start at 00-400  Call in tomorrow to
compare results.  It would be good if we could have this board up before
10pm at night at the weekend so we could advance quicker ?  Anyway stick

       KP2 200 516 751 2600 C

   That is the 2600 magazine voice line in U.S....needless to say, not a
sausage (unless you count some dude going on about TH COUNTRY CODE I WAS
CALLING... exactly 201 times...git).

  Anyway, the point is this scan needs a) more manpower, and b) some sort
of central organisation...Phantasm..sort it out m8 :)

I wanted to figure out what the hell +10176 .... was getting us to, so i
scanned for ages and eventually i managed to get through to a number ..
It was +101763256103 - and when i asked the guy where he was at he said
Barbados. Thus i guess you can still box to the 809 areacode. This is
strange, because unlike 808, 809 isn't one of the usual 0800890xxx
numbers.
 I'm not sure, but i found +10175 will also work. Haven't had time to scan
that properly. Anyone else scanning the +10xxx prefix's and onwards of you
get anywhere with one ? This could crack the boxing to the US (Maybe ...
Not sure i know what the hell i'm talking about :)
Keep trying, u can't do any harm ..... L8tr Gilby

PS. Anyone out there help me out, I need to call the US for a short time
only and I would appriciate if anyone has any CallingCards or suchlike
methods. It's just for 5 weeks, so i would even pay some cash for 4 or 5
working cards. Mail me if you can help ....

Sorry George I was not too clear.. I have scanned KP2 000 etc ... to
KP2 330 etc .... i.e. it seems I have heard the same country code message
330 times now.  If you carry on from 330 then I could try from 500 say.
Hope this is OK.  I will use the same telephone number that you are using
i.e. 2600 magazine voice line.  While I'm typing this, IS ANYBODY ELSE

   Incidentally I looked up a leaflet on phoneday last night, and it said
that the SUBSCRIBER international access code was going to change from
 010 to 00 on phoneday , 'This is part of a programme to make it
consistent throughout Europe'.  Can anyone on here manage to box a call to
a uk operator? If so it may be possible to bullshit them out of the
routing codes we want..in the meanwhile I will continue scanning....I
WOULD appreciate some help though..c'mon guys, leave a message stating
what range you are willing to scan and GET TO IT!
