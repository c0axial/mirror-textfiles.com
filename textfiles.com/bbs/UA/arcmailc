If anyone is thinking of scanning 0500-892-XXX I would advise you not
to waste your time. I scanned the whole range today from 000 to 999 and
only found '1' single active line. i.e. 0500-892-305 which didn't even
answer, but it sounds like a North American ringing tone.

I would want to scan the entire 0500 numbers. this would take a long
time. Is there anybody willing to help? a bit of coordination would
save lots of duplication...

To the person who was talking about co-ordinating a scan. 
When I had nothing better to do a while back I scanned all of 0500-89X
twice over. There's very little above 890. This kind of means that
regular scans are more necessary because one number could quite easily
go up or down in a couple of months and thats quite a large percentage
of such a small total!
 
I'll find that scan and upload it.

Just finished wardialing 0500 000xxx range and found 5 carriers which
are:

0500-000170
0500-000324
0500-000695
0500-000847
0500-000967

Unfortuanately all of these are fax machines but it saves doing it 
yourself, I found in total 212 connected numbas, if anyone wants a 
list of these then mail me and I'll give it you.

<<GeNeRaL HeDcAsE>>

PS:I'm hopeing to scan the entire 0500 xxxxxx range if anyone wants to
help then mail me, it could cut the time taken down to about 2 years
:->

PPS:Just done 289xxx theres a modem on 289389 and fax on 289421, 
only 23 connected numbas this time.
