AC Assassin, those two hackers mentioned in the MTV program were not jailed
for blue boxing. As far as I am aware the two hackers were PAD and GANDALF
who were sentenced for hacking into various systems around the globe.

The last time people were arrested for blue boxing in the U.K. was during
the mid 1970's.

News Update: Tuesday 24-May-94 21:01:45

The Hayes Optima 28.8k modem should arrive tomorrow. I will do my best to
get everything configured and running upto 14.4k before the weekend.

Due to the fact that my serial port will not support 28.8k, this system
will probably be running on a 386/486 before the end of 1994.

george king/sjc: it aint the phoneday thingy at all, Bt stopped it coz to
many poeople were boxing to the Uk, that is why it died, they have been

unlikly you will be able to box at all from the old numbers

 Title: Organise
  From: Gilby [72]
  Time: Sat May 28 00:46:05 1994
Everyone :
 I have spoken to someone pretty senior within the BT establishment and
they confirmed that a software change and/or some sort of filter was
placed on the lines to stop boxing. The reason, he told me, was that after
the channel 4 program the instances of blueboxers skyrocketed and they
felt that it had to be stopped.
 However, he is getting some engineers to find some other routs for me to
use. I gave him some info about what freqs. and dial patterns we could
dial and he suggested russia would be a good place to use. Whatever
happens, it can't be bad - some BT engineers working on a way round boxing
for me. Basically they know everything about all these countries phone
exchanges, so it shouldn't take that long. I am only here weekend tho.
Keep you posted. BTW Can anyone supply me with some calling cards ....
mail me please !!!!! Thanks Gilby

News Update: Tuesday 24-May-94 21:01:45

The Hayes Optima 28.8k modem should arrive tomorrow. I will do my best to
get everything configured and running upto 14.4k before the weekend.

Due to the fact that my serial port will not support 28.8k, this system
will probably be running on a 386/486 before the end of 1994.
