Could someone recommend some good electronics suppliers with hefty
catalogues and plenty of lines in stock (including obscure stock) ?
 
Cheers

You won't get one unless you've got an account (like me) with RS but
try Electromail they should have a CD soon, they're RS for people
without an account.

Max.

has anybody ever tried to make a tempest device?  The hackers handbook
reckons it can be done for 30-40 quid.  Ive seen professional makes for
2000 quid. (two thousand.)   If anyone wants to help, leave a post.

this company, display electronics has got an advert bbs, 081 6791888,
but theres never any reply when I try.   And it is probably shite as
well,  but they do sell "INFRA RED RED TOP HEAT SEAKING MISSILES",
which would be kinda neat...

Don't bother with the ones of the DIY type, the do one on a PCB but
they give you some parts which don't fit, the ones already built are
quite decent.

If you are still after plans for a stun gun let me know, I have some
here on paper (easier to read than those crap ASCII attempts of
circuit diags) however I did make a file called STUNGUN.TXT a few years
ago which detailed the same production stages, got a feeling it may be
on here. Anyway, if you want a hardcopy let me knoe and I can post you
it or FAX it to you or something.

Anyone know how to make a box that lets you listen in to your 
wardialling, vmb hacking etc.... without cocking it up when your modem 
hang's up and you don't, like when you use a phone. Plans or whatever
would be nice.

Yeah but my modem speaker is complete crap, makes every one sound like
Billy Connely :]. Also I don't wanna toss around with my modem too much
cos it was exspenxive and I have a habit of breaking things.
