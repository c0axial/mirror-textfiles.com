I have decided to remove the NEW Uploads file area in the near future.
 
Users are asked to upload files into the correct file area. This will
save me the task of moving 50-100 files every couple of months.

If you have not seen this film, watch it! It's from the same people who
did WarGames, but it is much better and very funny at times. (and it
doesn't even feature a wardialling accoustic coupler) <g>

I'm helping organise a UK hackers conference
next year, and am looking for potential speakers
and workshoppers.  The conference will have a
wide scope - linux activists, cryppies, hardware
hackers, packet radio amatuers, phreaks, network
explorers, programmers, security hackers, and all
other computer enthusiasts will be welcome.
So if you fancy giving a talk about any kind of
hackerish subject, *please* get in touch.  It'll
be zero-profit making, so there won't be any big
financial rewards, but it'll be darn good fun.

The reason your'e getting all those calls for the price of
a local is because thats a private BT GEC Network for Inter
Development and centre use only...I used to be able to 
contact my man on the inside using that number at the 
Software Development centre, but Im not surprised its gone
down...I did a scan of it, but theres nothing radically
interesting there anyway.
 
        I recognised the number prefix straight away...
I take it you got it from scanning or a dodgey BT bloke??
BTW, if you can be bothered, 0141-220-6XXX handles all 
calls into and out of The Development Centre down near
Glasgow University Road, off Briars road. Its a big
fucking place, and thats some SERIOUS equipment they have
in there, like a SunOS system for each user and secretaries
using fucking Risc stations... My mouth was like round my
heels walking thru there.
 
PS : They put the bins out each Tuesday, and theyre collected
     as far as I know by a private firm.

Right, I don't want to solder the wires on directly to the fone,
cos that will make it look a bit shit.  Also, it'll mean a lot
of fucking about to connect a modem to it.
 
I think the only other thing is to get one of those 'shoe' things
from car kits and stuff.  I should then be able to use one shoe
for reprogramming the fone and using a modem, if I make 2 
different cables.
 
Now all I need is a shoe, where can I get one from, and how much
will they cost?

Does anyone have full details (ie ones I can implement from) for any
strong secret-key cypher apart from DES? I am planning a strong crypto
program to be written initially for PC in hand-hacked 8086 ASM for the
benefit of those on the hacking scene who are sceptical of DES and the
other widely distributed alogorithms. Alternatively, can someone point
me to good references?

                              User Guide

What is cipher ??

Cipher is a paperless time recording system using the PSION P250 
field terminal. CIPHER replaces the need for field staff to complete
paper records such as, the A1650 IMAP form and the PARIS 401/412 time
sheet.

Job, Pay, and Allowances details are directly entered in to cipher by
the field technician, and stored in a removable datapak in the back of
the field terminal.

All of this is copied from the user guide, somebody had gotten hold 
of one of these and wanted instructions to use it, so I thought I 
might as well type up the user guide :) yeah, i know its kind of sad,
but I've nothing better to do :(

This really isn't of much use unless you have a P250 with CIPHER on 
it though :(

I've uploaded it as cfcipher.zip to the general phile area

Well, there's three BBS packages, one carding program, two wardiallers
(can't get them to work though) about four or five C
compiler/assemblers and the greatest debugger in the world, barring
none (MacsBug 6.5d12). Much of the best software on the mac is free or
shareware, and commercial warez are lamely protected if at all.

Oh, and by the way, the 9500/132 with the yummy 604 CPU is just a mite
fast.

You can (and I do) use a PC modem (external) on a Mac. Only the cable
is different. The PPowerMacs are pretty fast/reliable running 680x0
software. They kick major butt speedwise. Even a 25MHz '040 is
subjectively pretty fast in a mac (about like a DX4 in feel).

I think the Apple PC card only fits the 6100, but there may be
third-party cards for other models.

I pay 35 pounds for mine, which is a fair price when you consider that
an Amiga CD-ROM can hold about 1,500 disks in .DMS format.
 
Anyone charging above 45 quid is a pirate in more sense than one. <g>
