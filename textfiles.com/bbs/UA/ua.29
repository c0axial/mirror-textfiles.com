Hiya all,
   I'm new to phreaking but I own a Mercury one2one and I was wondering if
anyone could tell me how to access the test modes on it, and also if it
can be connected to my modem.  It has a port on the bottom for car kit and
stuff but I don't know the pinouts.\n Thanx in advance.\n Fallen Angel.\n

I did make a giant devil banger out of the stuff from about 30 wrapped in
a few rizla papers stuck together. I got a mate to throw it but it
exploded in his hand (heh heh), now he can't go near a box of them without
shitting himself (BA HA HA HA HA).

 Title: plastique
  From: Flash [172]
  Time: Sun Jun 05 23:32:48 1994
I got a file from here about making plastique from 1 part petrol to 2
parts vaseline, it showed a way to detonate it by putting some over a
mains socket and then sticking a paper-clip into it.  I made some and
tried to set it off using a mates rocket launcher detonater thing but it
didn't work so I tried putting some mains lecky through it but nothing
happened.  Can anyone suggest a way to use it?

Kixx, what you are doing is very risky..But from my experince(when
ordering legit stuff) they will ring the door bell, if yer aint in they
wont deliver, you then have the option of having a redelivery or in
somecases picking it up from the depot
