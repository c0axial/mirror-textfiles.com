When ya call it says "authorization number(or code?) please", and after ya
entered 8 digits, it says (invalid) and asks for the authorization number
again (you can enter it 4 times, and then it hangs up)... I found about 20
of them in a row ookhy}>>'

theyre not 24 hours then what are they the rest of the time. yank time
varies from abt 6 to 8 earlier than gmt (uk) so presumably ya lookin at
roughly 0200 to 1400 gmt. check ya email (g).

out' so to speak, to see if the guys on here would be interested in
contributing to/supporting such a line...It is proposed that we'll change
the number VERY frequently (even if it's not neccessary! hehe), so's to
keep 'lamers' from free-loading our decent stuff/info...Ok, PLEASE mail me
on this one, 'cos I'd like to know YEAH or NEY a.s.a.p! Thanks...

Hmm...right! I've hacked a UK VMB (not a 89xxxx no.), and I also got lucky
and hacked the sys admin box! So it's time to get a 'VMB City' or a
'Citadel' or whatever you wanna call it going.  So let's get things sorted
out...Mail me HERE, or leave me voice mail (for those of you that CAN
speak) on 0800 892361, ext: 611...those that aren't in the uk can also
leave me mail on this sys by calling 1-800-877-3837, but seeing as the
purpose is to find out who wants to be on my VMB City in the UK, it's not
really recommended! hahahha...(what a wit).
 
Right...GET YOUR ORDERS IN FOLKS! Let me know what your MAIN interests
are, and so on...and a SECURE place to contact you (ie: 0800 vmb or
whatever) with your private box # and pw...I am also doing a 0800/1-800 24
hour system that we can communicate with our American cousins on, but this
won't be around until later in the week I fear, so we'll make do with
this...L8r ppl, DON'T IGNORE THIS! hehe...bye 4now - MAELSTROM
