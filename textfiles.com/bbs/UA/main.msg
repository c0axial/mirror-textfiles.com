details of security flaws in VMS and Unix and loads of other shit...
Unarchived it is over 1mb...

Is anyone else going to the 'hacking at the end of the universe'
conference in Holland? I will be driving to Harwich with The Grim Reaper
and Boot on the 3rd of August (11.30am ferry). Are any other UK subversives
making the effort? Three days packed with underground workshops, meetings,
conferences and the Party at the End of Time (PET) with 'smokes of assorted
types' available.

At the moment, myself, The Grim Reaper, Boot and Mark Bennet (editor of
Black Ice) seem to be the only U.K. attendees. It has only cost the two
users travelling with me 40.00 pounds each which is very good. The three
day event will cost 35.00 pounds which includes camp site, workshops,
party, etc. We hope to logon from the conference and let you all know about
the days events and upload an ASCII postcard.

The Grim Reaper, I decided to form -BuG- the British Underground Guild for
the few British hackers/phone phreaks/anarchists still active.
 
The reason for the 1:1 post/call ratio is simple. All non-contributing
user accounts will be deleted and UnAuThOrIsEd AcCeSs will become a
closed system. This will ensure a steady flow of information and only
those who support the system will remain.

The previous one (in 1989) was for free and there was also Internet

money since you have to consider that most hackers/phreakers are students.

  From: Cryptic [8]

Has Anyone Read The Specs. On the new vodafone MCN which they hope to
install later this year.  They will be using the GSM and using digital
phones each subscriber will have their own SIMCARD(Subscriber Identity
Module) either as a credit card or miniature plug-in thing.  This chip
allows the Subscriber to go anywhere in the world with their phone or
anybdy elses phone just by using their SIMCARD in the phone ... It allows
you to receive and make calls on any phone..anywhere .!! 
  The technology/extras the card brings also are an authentication
alogarithym(to make sure the chip is an original) an encryption algorithm
which determines the speech cipher code two security codes to protect
against unauthorised use. and 5 short memory stores(can`t understand
these) allowing the useer to store a message of up to 160 characters each.
 
 Other extras in the new network will be Call forwarding, call barring,
Short Message Service(Still Can`t work this one out), Cell broadcast, data
trasmission, call waiting, hyold for enquiry, upto 6 way conferencing,
caller ID facility and call transfer .. these will be phased in over 2
years.
 
The best thing I think of this is the fact that later versions of these
GSM phones will be able to interface will all portable PCs/COmputers/Handhe
lds etc allowing data trans. upto 9600 bps.
  Apparently Vodaphone have installed most of the GSM network (90%) so its
just a matter of public availabilty of the phones etc .. or am I being
stupid and has everybody known about this for ages ... anyway I`ll
transribe a copy of the bulletin I`ve got and u/load it sometime ... later

I am trying to set up an anarchist BBS based in manchester.  AKOF was
first
started this year as part of the manchester anti copyright convention, and
has since become a permanent fixture.
 
I intend to 'grow' AKOF into a BBS where people can access all sorts of 
information, concerning all sorts of 'subversive' subjects including
hacking and phreaking and also things such as squatting and free festival
information.
 
The main problem with AKOF has been the lack of users, and in particular, 
the lack of users interested in more than downloading video games.  So I
am attempting to make contact with other people interested in this sort
of BBS.
 
Any help that you can give would be most appreciated, uploads and contact
numbers are particually needed.

UxU), they're sending a delegation too. They'll be wearing T-shirts with
'UxU' handwritten on it. As for the Belgians (only two so far), we'll be
wearing a red hat with 'BELGA' written on one side and 'LIVE' on the other
side. It's one of these hats we get for free on every concert in Belgium.
Now, I suggest that you guys (the British) hang a big sign above the
entrance of your tent saying 'UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS' or something. Will
probably attract the feds as a pile of shit does with flies, but at least
i'll be able to identify you.
 
See you all in Holland, T0
 
BTW, it's amazing to see how many British companies have most of their
Unix users use the system without a password. Also, mucho ALTOS' and NCR
systems around in the UK, and both come with quite some defaults which
nearly always work. But we'll disuss that in Holland.

most of us are defraurding columbia,philppieens and chile of wich are the
most commern boxing roughts.... untill about 2 weaks ago i was spending
about 7 hours a day online to the states ..i dont belive that bt or any
other ph company are nieve about bbing but i dont think that they are to
botherd... what can bt do about it!!!  Can they prosecute me for making a
call to an outside opp in chile  .. what the shit can chile do ..extradite
me? if they  gotta gether thay could do some harm but i thing it is
beond them..i am proberly wrong about the hole affair ,(is that byt noking
on me door?)..i thing that every one should start looking again for new
ways to bbox out of the contry.. i can see bt putting filters on all
outgoing opp lines.. can thay do this!!
i am quite eager for BT to come knoking on my door for i whould find out
alot about there technics on finding phreakers... i dont use opps on 
063,056,057 etc ,etc .these are to popular and if any one started
monitering opps they whould most defenetly start on these....
if any of ya guys think the above is a lot of shit..i whould like to hear
your vieus on this subject...its about time we all had a good descution on

slip un-noticed under without been busted...0
remember if bt start to bust people it will make phreaking very dificult.

                   (What a crap title eh?!)
                       
The Crim manual called the Jolly Roger's CookBook also gives detailed
instructions on how to murder with their bare hands,forge bank notes
and grow illegal drugs.
    It is now one of the most widely copied disks in Britain.A news
reporter of News of the World obtained one from a teenage pupil at 
North London Comprehensive school for 5 pounds.
    Shocked MPs have called for an imediate ban on the disk,Tory Anne
winterton who camaigns against computer porn,said:"This is just as
degrading as pornography and criminally dangerous.
     "We must find ways for the home office to ban this material."
      Labours Frank Cook said:"We have a tough enough time dismantling
the wareheads around the world without a whole new generation of
children being taught to build bombs."
      "Parents should move computers into the living room so they can see
what is being fed up into the screens."
      And former bomb disposal chief Peter Gurney said:"I have
investigated
many incidents where children havvvvvvvvvvvvvvd and maimed ussss home-made
explllllllllllllllllllllllk contains hundredddddddddddddddddddddhich can
be        on the

those used by the IRA.
If chemicles are unavailable it advises viewers to use a number
of"householddddddddddddddddddddddddddhem.
Theee                       w to use grenadessssssssssssmbs and how to set

Why not try a little gadget called THE VIDEO ENHANCER its a legal device
available in the UK which strips off the protection which is one
line{above the TV but is not usually copied when doing tape to tape but
neeeded for that tape film sync. It replaces it with a copied blue line
sync. Note you never actually see this blue line, Iam told its present
though. I think they retail for under a ton, I can get you all the info
you want on them if you like. what you got thats new, I got ROBO 3,

You guys missed a really good laugh at the conference...
As for copy protection on videos, I think if you take the signal from VHS
out to Betamax in and Betamax out to VHS in and play the tape on VHS 1 and
the recording tape on VHS 2 it gets rid of the shit (something to do with
screen compression apparently...)
Can anyone set me up withg some good pirate videos, the ones you were
mentioning Cypher sounded cool, how can I get hold of them?
nb. Details on the video enhancer would be good :-)
I have never seen so many geeks in one place at that conference although
there were some cool people there loike Emmanuelle Goldstein, Ropp, The
Key, The Dude, live chat with Phiber Optic, Billsf (Weird Al :-) and other
assorted from CCC, 2600, Hacktic etc.
BTW...go to Amsterdam, it is the best place I have ever been in my life
