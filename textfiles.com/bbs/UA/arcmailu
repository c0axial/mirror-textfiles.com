Hi All
Just sent a file called BUST_BT!.TXT, not its not about busting BT :-(
but is mail I sent as reply to the recent BUSTED information. It also
contains BT terms and conditions. You have nothing to worry about, as
long as you are sensible. PS. Don't sell this as BT will get even more
stirred up! The file BUST_BT!.TXT is in the Phone/Phreak area.

Sorry about the 2400 baud modem, but since I have had so much trouble
using 14.4k on this line, I have decided to buy a cheap v32 9600 baud

moved into their correct directories. I have just downloaded all the

I've uploaded a file called FTPD.C This is a hacked around
version of the wu-ftpd package for unix boxes. It supports
better security for ftp sites, especially those you wouldnt
want admins to find out about ;) It also supports the ability
to run off of a different port than the normal one (so you
could run it as a second server and run a legit server on
the normal port), and allows ratios

If you want to use it and need any help, mail me.

I got this off a PD board, the description didn't say much, but
anything with "abuse" in the title is worth downloading on the
off-chance. But no joy. So.... what the fuck is it, and is it kool or
krummy?

 I have finally completed uploading all the UABBS files. There are now
over 3,600 files available for download.
 
I am also looking into the possibility of having all this material put
onto a CD-ROM. This would save me a lot of storage space and mean that
I don't have to worry so much about my hard drive crashing.
