Should I upgrade to Ami-Express v3.37 when the Hayes Optima 28.8k is
installed? I also plan on purchasing a Supra 28MHz accelerator card in

886+8+acn+st, BUT you say the 44 code for the UK isn't part of what you

Oh yeah, why/how does changing 272 with 179 work, and how did you work

possible to blue box back to the U.K. Most people seem to have only found
out about this during the last couple of months.

Hmm...I don't know about the method that u are using Blackthorn....Ihave
managed to box back to the UK using international ops by way of :
KP2-XX-Y-ZZZZZZZZZ-ST where XX is the country code and Y is the
Identification (I think), Anyway the country code for the UK is not 44 as
you might think - I won't tell the number used , as said before, it is
more of an acheivement to work it out yerself. It seems to work on all
numbers I have tried so far....
 
BTW. As Phantasm pointed out...the exchanges that became unseizeable have
now become siezeable onmce more....Hmmm, is there something to to worry
about by boxing on the se numbers or not? Who makes the loss out of
phreaking? BT or the remote telco? Has anyone got any idea as to how BT
wopuld detect us boxers?

I am visiting a friend on Friday to start work on a portable blue box
unit. The circuit is from an old issue of TAP (classic 1970s phone phreak
newsletter) and is built around two 555 timers. The only frequencies which
need to be added are 2600/2400Hz and 2400/2400Hz. We hope to use a normal
phone keypad with * producing 2400/2600, 2400/2400Hz and # producing the
tones for Key Pulse 2. The guy who we are meeting is supposed to be an
electronics wizard, so lets hope it's true!

Well now I think that I could be in with a shout here....  Is the id code
a 1 or a zero.  If you can tell us that much it does narrow it down a bit.
I only have to scan the other 99 then to get the right code..... ho hum

I always thought that the tones required had to be sinusoidal.  The good
old 555 generates a square wave.  I suppose it could sound pretty similar
though.  I have some electronics experience so if I can help just shout.
I wondered about using one of these Casio FX730 computers to drive some
hardware to produce a handheld box.  Does anybody know whet the pin outs
are on the rear.  Anyway just a thought ......

you can only dial a few numbers in bristol with 272 but if u replace this
with 179 u can call nearly all others apart from my xchange :( and UA

a good method of discovering valid meridian VMB accs is using the Express
service that usually goes hand in hand with Meridian VMBs.
it seems that within the VMB tel. no. range there is a service which
alows you to send msgs without all the menu shit.
after the 'Express mail...mailbox?' prompt just start entering numbers
(with following #) to find valid boxes....
hmmm...might be usefull....
