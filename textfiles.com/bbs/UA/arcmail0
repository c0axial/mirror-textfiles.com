something is up.. btw check out 0345 258 258.. hit 7 to get a dialtone
then 9 followed by the number you are calling.. its a heap of shit and
the line is REAL quiet.. dunno what the fuck is wrong with it!

Obviously Dloading a massive zip file doesnt appeal to soem people, and
I cant find my SLH zip here anywhere, so Ive just uploaded some of my
better Phreaking stuff to dload one file at a time. This was all
written under my previous handle, and apart from one or two lame ones,
is 100% accurate. Enjoy.

Wahay!! I have finally given up my trusty old ST, and got a semi-cool
noteook.  It was supposed to come with just DOS 5, but when I got it,
it had DOS 6.2, and Windows too!! (Hurrah! 3 cheers for Microsoft! ;) )
Anywayz, I haven't got the original disks, and I need 2 files to get
it set up.  If anyone could give me DICONIX.DRV and LANGENG.DLL, I'd be
really chuffed.
 
Cheers, Flash.
 
P.S. How the fuck do I get 386 Enhanced mode, there is no fucking
icon!!
