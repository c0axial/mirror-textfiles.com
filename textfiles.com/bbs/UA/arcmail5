  Um, what is the frequency distribution for cellphones in the UK, all
the files I have read state that the freqs are in the 800mhz range, but
when i scan in the UK, I get cells between 918 and 963 mhz. Also are
the forward channels higher or lower than the reverse ones? Does
anybody have any interesting ROM images for any good cell phones. Also,
how is everybody coupling there MODEMS to there cell-phones? Will a
direct link (wire to wire) work, or is it Acoustic Coupler only?
 
     Thanx for the help, George

The lowest Mobile transmit frequency is 872 mhz
The highest Mobile transmit frequency is 905 mhz
The lowest Base transmit frequency is 917 mhz
The highest Base transmit frequency is 950 mhz
There is a 45 mhz split between transmit and recieve
But there are gaps in the allocation, 934mhz CB for example.
Hope this answers some of your queries.
As to the connecting of the modem, it's in phate103 if it ever comes
out, I have a preview copy (not complete), but until the situation with
maelstrom becomes clearer, I'm not going to release it, as the full
version would be better, and also it's really down to mael to give it
the go ahead if it turns out the original has been lost due to the
recent goings on..

Alrighty..
 
I was talking to someone today who *really* knows his cellphone shit.
He's got loadsa units, he called me today on a v. highly modded 4500x.
He's spent like thousands of pounds on hardware and software and shit
for his "hobby". He's selling spy-track gear for 3-500 quid I think.
Depending on how much he likes you (he makes it himself).
 
Anyway, I forgot to ask him about the bus, I'll give him a call
tomorrow for ya. Oh he's also using the proper Motorola modem
interfaces... If anyone can get 4 more he'd be willing to do a deal of
some sort.

     Is anyone using the p3 reprogramming software from this BBS?  If
so, can you tell me if you can reprogram the MIN from the software?  If
not, can it be reprogrammed from the handset without a NAM programming
adaptor?  I REALLY need to know before I go buy a new p3.  Incidentally
I have a supplier who can red-star a LEGITIMATE ESN-free NEC P3 to your
door next day for 130 uk pounds - that's the cheapest price I was
offered going through all the cellfone supplier's adverts I could find
for the last couple of days.  If anyone can beat this price I would be
interested.  Alternatively I would LOVE a motorola microtac-II,
legitimate or otherwise, if the price was right...

Well if you're interested in second hand I've seen a shop selling an
ESN-free P3 for 70 and a Mot8800 for 70... And I may have found a
source for 4500s at 30 quid each. I reckon that'd take a lot to beat.

I'm not sure about the Spytracks... But they cost, like, 300 quid or
something, so I'd stay away if you're on a similar budget to me :> I
don't think they can collect ESNs... In fact, no they don't - they just
allow you to enter a phone number and listen in on it. I think these
guys are currently finding a source for ESN readers which they are
going to begin selling, I'm hoping they're gonna be cheap.
 
As for the bus, I've asked his brother to ask him, and he also says he
knows a few other people that might know, I'll expect a phone call over
the next few days about that.
 
As for boards, I think he calls a few in Britain, not here or Urban XTC
tho... Can't really remember where, he calls a few in, like, Canada,
like Underworld and not surprisingly has v.good access wherever he
calls. He's got the proper Mot modem interface so he gets 14.4
connects.
 
Anyway, I'll keep ya posted about the bus info, it's just that he's the
kinda person that doesn't wanna mess with small-time phreaks, he's into
this for the big money, and would rather do a deal than give info out
for nothing.
 
Please give us a ring soon, cos I need to have a word with ya.

It has a mot microcontroller in it, a 68hc705, a dtmf decoder and a

Yep, I got em, they're a cunt aswell I might add. You gotta pry open

                             tx/rx isolation
 
To connect a modem to a motorola 4800.
 
You need :- 
            2 off  2.2uF capacitors. (non polarized)
            2 off  isolation transformers (signal) with 3 seperate
windings
            1 off  1k ohm preset 
            1 off  BT socket (to plug modem into)
 
Using a capacitor to provide DC isolation, connect winding (a) of
transformer
1 to pin 24 on D plug and the other end of winding (a) to pin 1 of the
D plug
via a capacitor. 
Connect winding (a) of transformer 2 in a similar manner to pins 24 &
6.
(see above).
 
Winding 1(b) & 2(b) are connected as in above picture, the start of
each winding
goes to the BT socket (pins 2 & 5), and the two ends connect to each
other.
 
Winding 1(c) & 2(c) are connected as in picture, the start of winding
1(c) is
connected to the end of winding 2(c), and 2(c) start is connected via a
1k 
preset to the end of 1(c).
 
The way it werks is thus.
  
  A signal being presented to winding 1(a) will appear on both 1(b) and
1(c).
  it will then couple to transformer 2 through 2(b) and 2(c), BUT
because 
  winding (c) is connected out of phase, it will cancel out the signal
induced
  by winding (b) thus giving no signal at 2(a).
 
  A signal from 2(a) will follow the same proceedure and not appear at
1(a), 
  but a signal at either 1(a) or 2(a) will be present at the modem.
(actually
  only 50% of the signal will reach the modem, the other 50% is eaten
up by
  the balancing resistor.
 
  The signal from the modem is delivered to both 1(a) & 2(a), (50% of
signal
  is present at both ports), but as pin 1 is the microphone input to
the fone
  it will accept the signal and send it on its way. Pin 6 on the other
hand 
  is the received audio, and it don't care if there is a signal
connected to
  it or not as it is an output.
 
  The pin numbers given are for the Motorola 45/48/6800
mobile/transportable,
  but the basic idea should werk on any cellfone. It is also a good
idea to 
  disable the microphone and earpiece in the handset once the modem is 
  connected, otherwise (a) the noise from the earpiece gets on your
tits, and
  (b) the microphone tends to pick up your 100 gigawatt stereo system
and send
  the output of same to the remote modem, this causes transmission
errors as 
  remote modems don't appreciate or understand 'techno techno techno',
at high
  volume levels.

It   is possible to add this type of 'fraud control' into a phone
system.  But the telcos want the revenue, so they tend to leave up
phones that could produce revenue.  Two phones (assuming they are not
in
use at the same time) can have the same MIN/ESN active as long as they
pass a 'velocity check' (e.g., one call from London and ten minutes 
later from Manchester would fail the check and the second call would
not
be allowed, if a 'velocity check' was in use).  Two phones with the
same
MIN/ESN can be in use as long as they are not in the same cell (hence
the logic in trading MIN/ESN pairs with other parts of the country
to roam).  Hope this helps.

vodafone will not allow two fones to make outgoing calls

the second fone, but cellnet just gets on with it.
As to who rings etc, the last one to log the network gets paged first,
so if you just switched on then you will get the call, if the legit
user has just logged he gets it.
If you want to rx a call, and you know when it is going to be, you
switch your fone off and on again to relog the cell, then your fone
rings and his doesn't.
complicated or wot.
I just disconnect the bell.
long live cellular.

the best fone is a motorola cos they make a special box that plugs into
the fone and then you plug your modem into the box, werks at upto 9600
but will werk at 12000 sometimes.

Doesn't seem to be many people actually know what a gold number is, a
guy who mends fones told me they were usually demo numbers that could
receive calls using any esn. Like the demo model in the BT shop..
can't really tell if you get a roamer, unless you scan both systems
and correlate the data looking for the same esn, the phone only logs
the system with the min from that system, it will have another min for
the other system.. (I think)..

About 10% of the numbers I get are international enabled, I think it's
entirely up to the airtime dealer what you get, but I know that
lifetime and lowcall don't get fuck all, no 3 way, no international and
no 0898.  Most of the airtime dealers werk under the assumtion that if
you want international capabilities, you'll ask for it.

You only need a valid esn/min pair and a pc/programing cable. No
hardware mods are needed, you don't even get to take the cover off the
fone if you use a 'brick' type. (4500 4800 6800) Beware the more modern
ones though, flipfones do require a little open heart surgery to get
them to change their identity.

BTW isn't running someone elses bill up illegal? Must consult my

I been experimenting quite a lot with the 4800, it's a fucking ugly
piece of shit, but it is dead easy to interface to.
I don't really understand what you mean by scanning?
If you just want to listen to conversations then you need celtrak or
celmon, gob a few wires onto your audio/logic board and away you go.

If on the other hand you mean scanning for pair snarfing purposes, I'm
still werking on that, it means a little bit of soldering here and
there to get over motorolas oversight, (they forgot to give me access
to the pll programing lines from the D socket), but what the hell.
The biggest problem is keeping the modem active, unless the fone finds
a forward channel and logs the system, it keeps switching the damn
modem on and off, (this is the internal modem for signalling, not this
peice of shit attached to my serial port.). As you can imagine, a modem
thats going on off on off on off on off on off on off ...... pretty
soon begings to get on ones tits as they say. But nevertheless,(biggest
werd I know), I'm still werking on it. I'll be sure to write a tfile on
it once the jobs sorted.

is about USD1700 and the ETACS USD2000, they've got a printer port so
you can leave them 'pair' scanning all day. Problem is they've only got 
a range of about 30 metres.
I've got an ad from an American cellular mag, can't find it at the
moment, but I'll let you know.

Fallen Angel, the P3 test rom is available online in the 'cellular
phreaking' file area. All you need to do is remove the original chip
from your P3, burn it with the modified binary source and re-insert it
back into the phone.
 
The codes for scanning and reprogramming the ESN/MIN can be found in
Jono's P3 test rom user guide.

not having tried it, I am only guessing if I tried to bulshit you.
but the modem interface will werk on any fone so long as you find the
audio wires, (mic & speaker). you will need to disable the internal mic
and speaker though, as the noise will get on your tits, and you will
have to sit in complete silence if the mic is still active.

You need audio in, audio out and ground. I think best fones are bricks,
they are easy to find the connections on, portables need lots of
fucking around with to get anywhere.

Yup I got Tac2 v1.6. v1.7 doesn't exist, 2.0 is uncopiable but there's
a copiable 2.0 around that's a fake of 1.5. Oh and 2.2 is a fake of 1.5
aswell. 
 
 ...go figure
I can upload v1.6 for ya, but if you got the money I'd suggest you buy
2.0 with Badtypes. (If you are going to buy it, don't buy 3.1 because
the only thing it does extra is the new 0374/0585 numbers and it's
about 3 times the price. And you can program 0374/0585 using the 9.11
motorola after anyway).

I wish people would take the _tiniest_ bit of initiative and actually
look at the software on here instead of constantly asking what software
will do their phone...
 
There's probably at least one copy of the Panasonic software on here
that will do the F series _and_ the diagrams are online aswell. (Look
for the one that involves the RS232 convertor thing).
 
If you really want I'll sell you the cables. There are some new cables
out now that use a lot less stuff on it - it can all fit into the
D-case at the parallel port instead of having a convertor box
inbetween. I don't have the diagrams unfortunately.
 
While I'm at it, what's everyone's obsession with 4800s and P3s ? Tehre
are plenty more bashable phones out there you know. We'd all be
cellular much quicker if you didn't all wait until you could find
yourself a 4800x. Plus the 4800s warrant big pockets and a strong back.
I prefer portable models.

4800s chuck out mobile power levels, they get to the cell without
loasdza hiss, they also do continuous transmission, whereas the
portables are usually vox operated, and not very easy to hang your
modem on. The bigest problem seems to be disconnecting the mic and ear
while the modem is online, everytime the budgie cheeps, the modem goes
into a retrain sequence...

You can international access on your cellular if you ask for it, you
can get it on lifetime and shit as well, they assume most people dont
want it and due to the escalation of phonez pinching it saves
cellnet/vodaphone or woever a lot of money (interms of lost airtime),

The problem is getting international dialling enabvled on someone elses
fone, if I wanted to pay for it, I would use a BT landline..
I doubt very much if you could ring vodafone and say, ' hello I'm 0836
123456, can you give me international direct dialling please', they
would want your name at very least, probably a letter too.
Besides, PABX extenders are safe to use when you on a cellfone, so
international isn't a problem.

cost 2 grand, would it be possible for you, or someone else, to knock 
together a snarfer, and we could all contribute to the cost.  Then 
someone, like Phantasm, could use it and give out the ESN/MIN pairs.
It would certainly be cheaper than getting one of them from the US.

Not noticed any difference in lifetime on either system (up here in the
frozen north :-) ).
Depends on how many ppl using that pair, and who the legit owner is.
Joe Bloggs Handyman who never makes calls only receives them will go
apeshit when he gets his bill, ( which could be anytime), Pickfords
will not notice for about 2 months untill the driver starts whining cos
they deducted 5 grand from his pay packet...

A P3 Modem connector is available - For a start, you can buy the NeFax
which is a portable fax which comes with the cable to connect it to an
NEC handportable - This you could also use for a modem.

I've noticed that Cellnet pairs last a hell of a lot longer than
Vodafone pairs. If you have enough to pick and choose go for the ones
with the older serial nums as they're long-standing and probably
business customers (more than likely).

You may have noticed that the 400+ pairz I posted on xmas day were all
vodafone numbers, so you may have a valid point on which system is the
most useful..
But notwithstanding the aforementioned, a pair is a pair, and if you
get five quids worth of calls off it for free, who's to complain.

There was once a version of celltrack which claimed to snarf pairs, but
I've never seen one that actually werked.

If you set everything on in the options menu, it will track all
coinversations, if you only intersested in certain numbers, this option
can also be set, and if celltrak sees this number it beeps. This is
ideal for industrial espionage or listening in to the local whore, but
other than that it is boring stuff, I stopped using it about a week
after I got it.

The carding idea is nearing fruition, so maybe some results fairly
soon. I'll order lots of some 1meg and 4 meg simms, perhaps send you a

Hi Davex, I was wondering whether you have your 4800X set up so that
you can autodial and scan for modems etc. just like a normal fone.
Interesting idea? You would probably 
need to put a command line switch in motdial to dial numbers or
something and then call it from a hacking/scanning script.
 
Just an idea... but perhaps the cellular s/w would recognise many very
short calls from the same fone??

I haven't done the mechanised version yet, I'm werking on a circuit to
decode dtmf and turn it into mot-bus codes, kinda like a hardware
motdial without the fone book, this would be compatible with toneloc
etc.
I've scanned whole exchanges manually using a pair of headfones in the
modem jack and using the scanner in motdial to do the dialing. The
netwerk doesn't seem to care about lots of calls, so long as they
remain within budget.  If you dl 5 megs from australia, the next call
won't go through, coz the netwerks 'high-roller' sw suspends the acc.
But this only happens between calls, so if you get online, you can stay
there all day.

I'll release the info for the hardware thing soon as I get it sorted, 
should make life much easier.

Has anyone else got my modem interface running yet???

Ah but you wouldn't be able to scan pbx's etc. with it, would you? I 
was think  thawith acommand line call likemotdial.com 00592279000
you would be able to scan using a script, or you could run hacking
programs like the Telix hacker, which would be pretty kewl.
 
Would there be a simpler way to dial that would werk on any Motorola?
I was messing about with the pins and when I turned my fone on I got
a load of ones across the display, and I could still edit it and 
dial. I thought that maybe you could control the data line in the 
reprogramming lead and get that to dial.
 
Im rking on your modem interface. Does anyone know the audio tx 
pin on an 8500X? I have the rx but no mic to test for the tx...

Here's some information I gathered on ESN's:
 
Whats in a ESN?
 
An ESN is short for Electronic Serial Number and just tells the company
who your with info, on your phone....etc..etc...heres what they mean:
 
Example: 02/01/00/18273
         ^^--Phone ID number
            ^^--Company ID
               ^^--ALWAYS 00, reserved for future expansion
                  ^^^^^--The ESN itself
 
The phone IDs are as follows:
02 - NEC phones
40 )
05 |- Motorola phones
03 )
29 - MD100 phones
11 - ClearTone Phones
04 - TechnoPhones
15 - Panasonic PHones
 
The ID's above tell the Cellphone company what phone the ESN is going
into. There are others, when I get them I'll post them.
Anyway thats about, This info will be in the text fiel I am releasing.

I have some friends in Newcastle who are currently building a low cost
device. I expect it will be priced around 300 pounds. This is very
cheap compared most esn/min grabbers, which are priced at over 1000
pounds.
 
These guys have been designing and building surveillance equipment for
the last 3 years and have done a lot of research into this type of
device. They also sell car alarm code grabbers similar to those
advertised in Exchange & Mart.

Sounds to me like you have version C. Version B displays the full
information. I would try reading the EPROM(?) on version B and put into
your version, and hope it works. The only problem, is that i very much
doubt it is a EPROM, but im sure you'll let me know :-)

So I need to know more about the motorola fone.
Primarily about the signals in the curly lead.
Does anyone have the definative story to this?
or even a good guess based on personal experience?

This info is around, celltrak's author knew how the fone communicates
with the handset, so did the various programming sw writers, so how
come none of YOU the cream of the UK's hacking/phreaking community seem
to know anything about it?

Lets liberate this piece of info, it will allow allsorts of
experimentation with bricks, might even lead to some decent sw being
developed.

I'll even give international pairz to anyone who comes up with the
goods.

I will sell you the Nokia 101/121 reprogramming kit for 130 + P&P. That
will get you the software + hardware, which consists of a programming
'shoe' in which you place the phone and one module which you add to the
phone you would like to program. (one module per phone) Extra modules
costs 20 quid.
 
You may hear about the Modules'r'Us kit which is a real waste of space.
You must solder the module onto the phone and each time you want to
reprogram you need to do it again. And most importantly, it only lets
you change the ESN four times.
 
This is the latest kit from Cheese Factory which brought you Sony,
Motorla, Ericsson etc. - The modules can be programmed as many times as
you like and each time you wish to program you just push the phone into
the shoe. (Rather than connecting wires up to the chip each time).
 
Mail me if interested.

The reason it wont let you change these functions is because you used
the temp lock code to unlock it when you turned it on.  It will only
let you change these features if you use the main lock code - 4 digits
long.  Try things like 1234 etc. or just use a test rom to bypass it !
Hope that was some help.

It connects to the unit perfectly and reads all the data from the NAM

then it immediately says "Comms Powerdown" - "Releasing Link" and wont
let me make any changes or edit anything.

Am I doing something wrong ?  I am using 12v and not 9v as in some lead

Should werk ok, but you need strong stable signal for data.
You will need to live at a cell site or fit an external antenna.

His software is of little use to you without the hardware. I should
imagine one of the main reasons he doesn't release the full information
for building a snarfer from scratch is so that people like you don't
get hold of it. The kind of person that would severely mistreat it and
probably sell the thing for 1200 quid a piece when you put no work into
the design yourself. You don't get anything for nothing in this world
so if you want a snarfer, get down to it yourself and don't get
somebody else to wipe your arse for you. 
 
Also why the hell should he give you ESN accounts ? There are security
reasons, ie people start asking questions when a hell of a lot of
people use accounts that are snarfed from the same area. With a little
thought and investigation he wouldn't be too difficult to track down.
So he keeps his head down. More to the point, do you really expect him
to give ESNs to the person who calls him a "BIG HEADED PENI". Big
headed he is not.
 
I'd advise you to voice-hack them if you're that bothered but I forgot
that you probably sound rather too much of a young pimply lad to pass
as a Vodafone engineer.

A mate of mine bought a motorolla classic on cellnet last year, he has
used loads and has never been billed for any calls (just gets billed
for the line rental). When he bought it, it was on business tariff so
he could get cheaper calls, when he found out that they wern't charging
he even managed to get it changed to the lifetime tariff with no
problems. He currently has a pocketful of spare batteries and hardly
ever makes any outgoing calls on his BT land line. Allright for some.

Assuming your fone is an MT4, I think the software you'll need goes by
the name of Beech or BeechTree or something. It normally knocks around
bbs' in a ZIP called CELLSOFT.ZIP that's got a load of other stuff in
there.
 
It involves programming the chip rather than just plugging a nice cable
into the bottom but it looks quite easy.

So how much would an 8255 card cost you ? The beechtree looks like a
cheap alternative (PIN-OUT.TXT) to buying a full-on EPROM programmer as
it says it programs the 93c46. Do you know any different ?

aright m8.. 
     the motorola 4800x is a very good bet - 3 watt output so it's like
a normal land line.. you'd need to make an interface though.. all the
interface's ive seen have lost about 50% of the signal coz they are
cheap and use resistors to balance the signals.. the best way to do it
would be to use a set of dual op-amps to actively balance the signal
(not as hard as it sounds).. if i ever get my hands on a 4800x i will
work on the circuit (of course.. if you find 2 you could donate one in
exchange for the interface :)..
anyway - l8rz, etherlord

Hi,
Got a Mitsubishi MT-8 Phone, been playing around with it for a while,
and have found the engineer code to access hidden menus (I have to
admit I was told the code)
To anyone who has one of these phones, try this:
Turn Phone on while holding down the red END button, hold END button
for 5 seconds,
Keep hold of button, key 2398378 , the display will change and show
something like 0906 td|-0 if it does'nt turn off phone and repeat.
key 03 SEND - your phone is now a scanner! use * and # to move up and
down through the channels.
If this is old knowledge sorry, I just got here!
Any info on what the other codes do would be great.

Mine broke a while ago so I gave it away to a service engineer friend

I have no idea if the following method will work, but in theory there
is no reason why it should not.
 
Buy a double phone line adaptor and plug your modem line in one socket
and an ordinary telephone in the other.
 
Leave your phone off the hook until the line is completely dead. (i.e.
after you have listened to "please replace the handset and try again"
about ten times.
 
Now, open your cellular phone and extend the wires connected to both
the ear piece and mouth piece speakers. (about 6 inches is long enough
in most cases)
 
Place the extended ear piece speaker from your cellular phone onto the
mouth piece on your telephone handset and sound proof it with masking
tape, etc.
 
Connect the extended mouth piece speaker/mic onto the ear piece on your
telephone handset and sound proof as above.
 
Basically what you have done is turned your modem into an accoustic
coupler device. All you need to do now is as follows;

Dial the BBS number you wish to phone on your cell phone and press SEND
as you would normally.

Type ATX3D or simply ATD into your terminal and you should connect to
the service you called on your cellular phone. The carrier signal will
be played into the mouth piece of your phone and into the modem. (which
is connected in series via the double socket adaptor) In the same way,
any signal from your modem, will be played into the cellular microphone
socket.
 
This should in theory work, but you may need to include a simple
amplification circuit to boost the sound comming out of your cellular
phone. I would guess that if your modem has error correction, at least
2400 should be possible.
 
Phantasm (SysOp)
 
P.S> I would be interested to hear what other users have to say about
this idea. It is just an idea, but it should work fine if your cellular
phone output volume is set to its maximum setting.

It works!!! I just held my cellular phone upside-down against my normal
phone handset, typed ATD into my terminal software and connected at 1200
baud. I know it's slow, but It proves my point. I will need to open my
mobile and tape the speaker/mic onto my telephone handset to connect at
any faster speeds. There is too much background noise to connect at
anything faster, but hey, this means that ANY cellular phone with a
fairly decent sound output can be used with a modem --- without the
hassle of building or buying a modem interface.

I was a little amazed it worked myself, especially when you consider
that all I did was place the cellular phone upside-down next to my
telephone handset with no extended wires or tape. I doubt anything above
4800 would be possible using this method, but you never know.

George recommends using a transportable since the sound output is much
better, etc. I am fairly sure I can manage a 2400 connect if I open my
telephone handset (or the cellular) and tape the ear piece and mouth
piece speakers onto my cellular phone. Opening your normal desktop
telephone handset is much easier than trying to put your cellular back
together.

     Well I am using a proper motorola cellular connection jobby, and
the fastest I've got so far is 2400..it's supposed to be possible to
get a 9600 connect with it but I'll be buggered if I can.  Perhaps I
should invest in a new aerial?

OK, folks, there's a small possibility I might be getting a snarfer

should it be. The Motorola 4800 seems to be recommended for modem use,

as i was reading the evening standard i came across an article about
cloning, and plans to stop it, me beeing the nice kind person that i
am,
typed it all up so you can all read it. 

Crackdown looms on mobile `clone phones' (Luke Blair evening standard)

New legislation to combat mobile phone fraud is beeing considered by
thegovernment amid fears growing evidence that that it is soaring out
of control,   The most serious problem "cloaning" where a stolen phone
is given someoneelses number - has exploded in recent months. the first
indication for ownersis the bill,which can be tens of thousands of
pounds. there is now evidencethat previously un-cloneable digital
phones are beeing used.   Mobile-phone companies, currently bearing the
cost put between 50 million
to 100 million a year, have been lobbying for a change in the law for
18months. Under the umbrella organisation fo the federation of
communicationservices, they are finally getting somewhere. at a recent
meeting with thehome office minister David MacLean, the industry was
left a hint thatsomething would be done.
   According to gary burnstein, head of corporate security for cellnet,
thatcould mean the creation fo new criminal offences. These would
outlaw the useof special scanning equipment, used to snatch  the
signals produced by mobilephones over the airwaves. They would also
make it illigal to transferinformation gleaned from those signals to a
mobile phone, the process knownas cloning, so it can be used by a new,
often by an entirely innocent, owner.
    "The government is very postive about doing something," said Mr
Bernstein"Two years ago we came up agaist a brick wall but now they are
veryreceptive." At present, using and even reprogramming a phone is not
illegal.Using the phone to avoid paying bills is fraud, but it is
virtuallyimpossible to prevent once cloning has taken place.
    Labour MP Brian Donohoe, who has taken up the issue in the commons
saidthe government had been reluctant to force new legislation on a
boomingindustry which is still in its infancy. But he added "the
pressure buildingup for a change is now irresistable." Part of the
concern is that with anynew boom in crime, there have been the
associated problems of escalatingviolence and links with drugs trade.
   But some of the most powerful pressure for change, ironically,comes
fromcloning itself, with an increasing number of its victims coming
from the veryinstitutions which until now appeared to be reluctant to
act - the government, parliment and the
police.-----------------------------------------------------------------

shit..it aint come out right, but i guess you can still read it ok..
looks like all you cell dudes will be in the shit if ya ever caught..

Err yeah.. I didn't think BT were still selling them which confuses me
somewhat. If it's quite tall and slim (but also quite broad) and the
aerial lifts up from the back it's probably a P3.
 
As for rechipping, yes you could whack in the test chip and change the
ESN through the handset.

Right guys, I was on irc channel #2600, and I asked if there were
any UK peeps there, and some chick called Anne-Lise said she was from
Coventry.  So I asked her what she was into (H/P-wise!!) she replied:
 
*Anne-Lise* Celljacking.
 
I realised she meant snarfing, so I asked her how she did it :),
 
*Anne-Lise* It involves a hand scanner, an MX761 chip and an 800mhz
bandwidth tuner for Vodaphone jacking.
 
*Anne-Lise* I 'takeover' computer lines over cellular after login.
 
I asked how much the setup cost, and she said 260 quid, to wich I
replied something like "JESUS!!! And you snarf with it?!?!?!?!"
 
*Anne-Lise* *nod*
 
When I tried to find out more she kicked me off the channel, saying
'Get a manual' :((
 
Well, is there any truth in this?? Why isn't anyone else doing it??
And why did a 'chick' know about all this when I didn't????

THat's so true. The saddest thing about phreaking is that as it becomes
harder to phreak from your own line, its becoming more and more so that
only professional criminal can defraud the phones successfully. As with
something I read the other day about GSM type stuff in the States - it
was defrauded, but by a mobile phone store, which sold loadsa phones
all with cards matching one particular phone sold to a "phantom"
customer, who duly disappeared when the bill arrived. The worst of it,
is that all this technology doesn't reduce the scale of phreaking, it
just takes it away from the "little people".

hmm...this really makes me laugh..you come on and make a lrge comment
with loads of big words about the price of the nec p3's that i am
trying to sell.  The price was just over 200 quid and you made such a
fuss about it and you yourslef where selling the fuckers for 200 quid. 
And they came with battery charger chip and 5 esns.  MY 200 QUID P3
comes with that and another bat an extended areial, carry case, and car
eliminator....think before you write the next message because you are
making yourself look like a right wanker.

I just got me a Motorola 8500x, Ive leeched all the files 'bout it off 
here and some say I need the cable to program it and some say I can 
programm it in test mode. Ive played around in test mode a bit, I had
actually cos I accidently locked the fone and didn't know the code :].
Oh yeah if I do have to use the cable, can you buy plugs to go on the
back instead of having to soldier it?.
 
I also got a Sony CM-H333, does anyone know anything about this fone?,
like the 8500x it only cost me 5 quid and I got cos it looked good 
(compared to the 8500x anyway :]).
