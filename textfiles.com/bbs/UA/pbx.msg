I think I've found a UK pbx, but I've got NO idea who it belongs to or the
code length etc. Here it is, and maybe someone will have some luck with
it.
0800 893 218.
Good Luck.

Im more or less clear on the use of a PBX but do I have to use a DTMF fone
to enter the code(or any DTMF touch tone oad of course) to use it or will
ordinary pulse dial do
?I ask this as Id prefer to use them from a payfone..

Well if you have a 14.4k modem why not type in before you call
AT&N6 this should temporary lock your modem in at 9600 and this is much
better for connects.

Private Branch Exchanges are usually used by Compaines who wish for all
their employees calls to be logged, and thus finacial cost control on
expenditures can be more easily aduited. But thats there problem, a PBX
will allow you to call anywhere in the world for free and allow you to
start alliance teleconfs for free as well. When you call usually you
would have to insert a pin digit pass code. To be allowed to dial out.
This can range from 4-6 digits although I did come across one that was a
10 digit one and that was the phone number of the business but that was a
total one off.
