A BT friend informed me with tears in his eyes that BT is only making this
year 65 quid per second,  compared to 95 quid per second last year.  So I
have sent them a donation.

re: donation to Telecom

Some people will believe anything. Do you really thing anyone would donate
anything to British Telecom? Although I guess it is easy to feel sorry for
such a sad company. I may send them 1p myself...

Since I have been expressing my concerns for British Tele$cum,  I would
also like to express my concerns for the queen mother :-)  I believe that
everyone should send her some flowers and a get well card because she has
done so much for us.  Fucken Shit - can you believe that the queen is
receiving so much attention because she has a soar throat - death to the
queen & Tele$cum!

I distinguishing mark of a Cyberpunk is his/her ability to realize the
power of plants (drugs really).  But I wondered if anyone out there
realized the power of plant accesories.  For example if you want to get
rid of spots use weed killer on your face,  if you wanna grow your hair
loong then shampoo with Miracle Gro.  Replies appreciated ...

   What...
     Is A leech?
     Does a leech use in his vocab?
     Does he look like?
     Do we do to kill them?
     Am I talking about?

I am talking about those losers out
there that take all our wares off of
our Catsend lines and give them to his
local buds...Yes...sound like someone
you know? Don't be afraid lad...we all
have them...But we need to know how to
recognize them and how to get rid of
them...That is very simple if you just
follow some directions and read this
file patiently!

 First of all as I said in 'The True
Leech Hazard' there is a difference
between an asshole and a leech so I
won't go over that in much detail...
But an asshole is someone you hate that
could be a very big pirate ready to
put your loser ass six feet deep...
(That is how far people are buried for
you dumbasses reading this)
A leech is someone you may not have
even ever heard of and you just want
to get rid of him...you may think it
is easy but most leech's are very
determined in getting their wares and
will use false names if necessary...
That means you shouldn't validate
someone who has just called your
catsend and uses a name...Ghost Buster
I heard is an awesome name...Maybe I
am exagerating the name but if you look
at anyone's info You can usually tell
if the guy is a fake or not...But
it isn't as easy as just deleting him
because when he found out that he
was deleted he will call back again
under a false loser name and eventually
he will pass the check that you give
each person because you can't always
tell a leech from a cool 'Rocker'...
haha...Also...Ali Baba or Dr. Micro
don't call catsends...so don't freak
out if someone says..ALI HERE!...say
back to him...ALI NOT HERE!...and
preceed to hang his ass up...but if
you did deal with Ali Baba and you
hung him up...then I will leave you
with a 'How to comit Suicide' file
but that is not under me...Ok well
pirates I am sure you guys may want
a demostration and a good vocabulary
of the leech to tell if you are dealing
with a leech...Aren't you excited?...

Johnny Pirate just opened the box to
his micromodem and is ready to set up
his local-loser board right after he
gets permission to call long distance
on AT&T so he can get on the awesome
100 meg catsend in Boonfuck,VA....So
he does just that...that is he is
using is microscrotum dialer...finally
he is on...

Bye...

---------------------------------------

Folks Johnny just hit rock bottom...
he would usually call back and do the
same thing again and when the sysop
chats...they use their extended vocab.
of their awesome words...they include

PLEASE............PLEEZE
BYE...............LAT0R
                  L8ER
                  L8R
                  L80R
                  LAT0R 0N
YOU...............U
FRIEND............D00D
                  DOOD
COOL..............(OOL
                  C00L
                  KOOL
                  K00L

Folks these iren't all the leech's
words but if you haven't caught on
there is a pattern...also their
biggest word to use is PHUNY and
when they cuss on rag boards they
usually go $h!t or A$$H0le...
that is perfectly immature...and as
people say it is for you guys that
can't cut the PG-13 Law....HAHA...
Well L8er Guys and keep K00L you
awes0me D00DS U...

 Title: PLUNDERBOX
  From: Plunderer [89]
  Time: Sun Jan 24 22:50:43 1993

After many requests I have uploaded PlunderBox, a PC Blue Box program
which I wrote because I was pissed off with so many lame ones floating
about.  The program is very simple to use which is why there are no docs
with it.  The only thing that you need to know is that the program
automatically dials KP & ST tones for you (the lengths of which may be
defined in the config screen).  Any comments, suggestions or criticisms
would be appreciated.
BTW : version 1.8beta is only needed if you have a fast 486 because 1.7
sometimes cocks up on them.

Does it still use samples of the tones from the amiga or does it now
actaully have the tone genertaion built in? as when i truied it before the
tones werent exactly right which cause a few problems.. Personally i find
OmegaBox is still a better programme.. but then again i havent looked at
PlunderBox for over 6 months now.

Okay, the meet will take place on Saturday 6th February outside the Punch
and Judy pub, which is inside Covent Garden, London, at 1pm. Nearest tube
is of course, Covent Garden. It is easy to find. If you are coming and
need more info etc mail me asap..........

I came in part way through this conversation.  It sounds like you are
planning a meeting on Feb 6th, at the Punch & Judy - is that correct?  If
so then I'll try and come along.  The Punch and Judy, however, is a large
pub (both a large upstair, with balcony and a large cellar downstairs).
I'd hate anyone to arrive but be able to find the rest of us.

 Title: Laser printer wanted
  From: AC Assassin [15]
  Time: Sun May 23 02:18:21 1993

Anyone got or likely to come across a decent laser printer in the near
future? I am starting a business during my summer hols with another
person, writing systems for the aerospace industry, they have showed a lot
of interest and are willing to pay 10 grand for a simple inventory system
with no relational stuff, normalisation, nothing. Who, knows, if this
takes off, i may just donate a hard drive ti the BB (if I earn loadsa
money).
