I think this bantering your going on about is a lot of fuqing bullshit,
just sit back and think about it, it's got jack shit to do with BT, to
prove, other countries have suddenly have trouble routing to the US to
(uncomfirmed, but would someone find out for sure please?).When you seaze
the trunk you are "sitting" inside that countrys exchange (or at least I
have allways thought of it in these smiplistic ways).. (oh and I just anit
buying this International Sender in Bath/Blackpool bull).. OK as for Z's
varios calls with BT, BT could just be playing along and getting very sick
of it, anyways I am not saying this IS how it is, but I am saying lets
take a freash look at it from a diffrent angle and forget about BT for a
while...

 Title: My bullshit..
  From: Mini Master [145]
  Time: Mon May 30 22:45:22 1994
You do have a point there, I'm new to this bbs, and
havent had as much experience in phreaking as most of you guys,
but I don't know if we are breaking outside this country or where.
But I beleve it's breaking here, in sunny England. Why??
----
1) Line quality: When you break, listen, how many times have you
heard ANY international line sound that clear, NO excessive line noise,
bleed through.
2) Dialing back in to the UK: You didn't even need to send the SP,
which makes me think it's been routing the call as you dialed. If you were
dialing from outside the UK then surely it'd take longer than that to
establish a link?? And you didnt have to dial the UK country code.
3) The 'voice'. Sure it could be just a reaction from a UK exchange to the
OTC tone (is that it's name??), but it's an English voice.
4) Symaltanious country changes: ALL the backbone boxable numbers had
EXACTLY the same propterys, the broke EXACTLY the same and the all went
down EXACTLY the same time, I doubt all the countrys would collabourate in
attempts to stop boxing.
----
Right there are my ideas on the matter, noboubt they all have
something that could be talked around.
----
What do people rekon on it being BT's fone day changes that made it
possable for us to box back in to the UK? Heres and idea, I don't
neccessarely beleve it, it's only an idea.
Everyone knows you dialed Kp2-01*no- The * could have been any
digit, or even just a delay. This followed BT's fone day exactly with the
addition of the 1 in the area code... The delay was needed to establish a
trunk within the UK for the call... It was not possable before because the
routing table deemed any numbers beginning with 02* 03* 04* 05* 06* etc.
would be refused, but not 01* because after London changed it's area code
to 081/071 then no area code had the prefix 01*. (geez, did that make
sence??) BT could have overlooked this fact....  This could be taken
further to say BT realised this was happening and when they got around to
changing this they also decided to stop normal boxing. It seems BT had
made
a rushed job of it, only banning MOST area codes in America (But leaving
most of Hawaii 808 accessable). In recent days they have modifyed the
routing table so most of Hawaii is off limits, but you still can get to
some operators there.
Last thing: I rekon it beeing Goon Hilly Cornwall..

 Title: what the fuck!
  From: Falastur [164]
  Time: Tue May 31 00:53:49 1994
Hi!

Yes, you are being charged for the call. What you have done is effectivly
pressed your RECALL button. This causes a 'hook flash' signal. Dialing 1
on a pulse dialing phone almost imitates this signal.

The hook flash signal is only processed on new digital System X or System
Y exchanges. Once the signal has been acknowledged you get a dial tone
whilst the original caller is placed on hold at the exchange. They get a
recorded anouncement every 30 seconds or so.

If you want to find out more about the facilities on your exchange, dial
150 during business hours and ask for more information of Star Network
Services.

There are two network services you get for free; Reminder Call and Charge
Advice. They only cost you when you use them. Some other neat facilities
are things like Three Way Calling, Call Waiting, Call Divert/Forwarding,
Call Barring etc.

There will be some other services available to the rest of the UK later
this year. There are currently being beta tested in London and wide area
beta tested in Scotland.

Have phun! ;-)

Hi!

Yup, same here. Hard at work at finding new routes. There has been a
national change in the international routing structure. Probably in
preparation for the new number system in the UK. This will be coming
online in mid June, in conjunction with the old system.

No, with a good line adaptor, cell/modem are very compatiable, the maximum

Ok just a few thoughts on general shit...
STUN GUN: Night not work, but if you got a mains transformer and applied a
decent sized battery via a micro switch to the secondary you should get a
fucking big voltage output but little currlet so unlikely to be fatal =(
Yeh I know transformers dont like DC so keep flicking the micro switch
then to will get 2 pulses per turn a posative spike and a neagtive..

HardWare Blue Box... The jolly box uses a R-2R network (simple D-A
converter??) to convert the binary image in to the tones all controled by
the processor which doesnt look like it's dping much work... Surely it
would be possable to make a cheap Z80 circuit with a 128K EPROM to do the
same thing... without the sounds in binary images on a chip get the
processor to output to a PIA or something and use a D/A chip to do the
rest.. I'm only starting on this shit so this may sound like total drivvel
;) So I dont give a toss - what do you think ?? =)
Laters

The Hayes Optima 28.8k modem should arrive any day now. I will do my best
to get everything configured and running upto 14.4k as soon as possible.

Due to the fact that my serial port will not support 28.8k, this system
will probably be running on a 386/486 before the end of 1994.

Whats  all this oooh you're so lame didn't you even know that stuff...
Some bloke (in this case Kixx) finds something new about the phone
system. So he decides to share it with everyone. So its just a regular
thing that he didn't know about/overlooked... That doesn't make him lame.
Thats makes him - yes you guessed it a phreak - just cos he hasn't had
much experience doesn't mean he's lame. They're are some guys about who
know more about the phone system than BT, but there was a time when even
they were starting out. Instead of slagging ppl off for discovering stuff
and sharing it we should be encouraging them. Yeah and I'm also pretty
inexperienced with phreaking and I want to learn. In my opinion 'lame' iks
an attitude not a level of knowledge gained...

They should both work well I havent built either.... What I did try

should kill but if placed on the mark in such a way that it went via his
heart, and the mark had a heart condition it COULD kill so be careful =)

This is available in most health food shops - you can also get buzz drinks

guarana molecule is similar to the caffeine molecule apparently.

The Hayes Optima 28.8k modem should arrive any day now. I will do my best
to get everything configured and running upto 14.4k as soon as possible.

Due to the fact that my serial port will not support 28.8k, this system
will probably be running on a 386/486 before the end of 1994.

 Title: Strange routing?
  From: Jono Bono [194]
  Time: Wed Jun 01 05:53:29 1994
Hi again, I tried the number that Blackthorn left 0800-890-139 break, then
KP2-592-1-1010C and you get a US but international Party line as he said.
.
But the 1 in the middle can be 5 or what ever but it must be there
otherwise it doesn't work? The number reported back on connection is
011-592-1010. Any ideas of how this is routing and why that odd routing
digit gets lost :-() .....Jono Bono....

Didn`t you understand Z-N0te`s msg? I mean I don`t agree with the way he
put it but he`s certainly right with his info...Why won`t changing routing
codes stop us finding them? with 10,000 possiblities it`s certainly going
to delay it, and with their new SCAN system only someone who has suffered
a crainial lobotomy would attempt to use new routes anyway...`nuff said.

  Time: Thu Jun 02 01:34:16 1994
The countries didn`t pool resources to stop blueboxing...it is my beleif
(confirmed by long chats with int. ops) that they just press a button
marked UK toi place the call...so to them it is of no consequence whether
the route is b440number-st or b236465234878242-44-number-st...you see what
I`m getting at? only a select handul of top engineers responsible for
their country`s international routings need know of the changes, and
that`s merely a phonecall away (as the BT ad`s say...)

Yep, phone cards are optical...if ya want info on them then there is a
file around on this board ('scribed by me from BT sources) that tells you
how they work. I don't think that stopping the h"hammer" woukld do
anything as the gauge is only for humans not the machine- it counts hte
units from the card using light techniques. Anyway, see the file for more
info (can't remember what its called xactly - perhaps someone eklse
knows...)

I thought the phonecards worked on a `refractive index` that refracts
(hence the name) the light at a certain angle when the unit is valid, and
is burned out (in some way, ok so I don`t know the specifics) when used
up?

Probably made with something akin to the ammonium-whatsit crystal touch

PS. How about dissecting loads of the things and putting them together as

News Update: Tuesday 24-May-94 21:01:45

The Hayes Optima 28.8k modem should arrive any day now. I will do my best
to get everything configured and running upto 14.4k as soon as possible.

Due to the fact that my serial port will not support 28.8k, this system
will probably be running on a 386/486 before the end of 1994.

Sorry for the delay, Phantasm (SysOp)
