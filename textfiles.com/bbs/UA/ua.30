 Title: Payphones
  From: Harlequin [99]
  Time: Mon Jun 06 22:35:04 1994
While messing around with a BT payphone I noticed that after hitting
the hang-up cradle on and off for about 5 mins it came up with 7.7
quids worth of credit and tried to dial a number...
I presume this is its way of letting BT know that its knackered
or something similar. Is this a known scam ?? And if so is there
anyway of stopping it dialling this number and being able to dial
yer own number with 7.7 quids credit ??

Yeah i do agree witht that about in not being an int trunk being broke...
another reason for thios is look at hgow long it took to route a Uk
call..liek as soon as ya dialed the last digit ya were thru yeah?
i dunno but maybe they did this so they were able to tap lines or
something like that??
All the saem i think the best bet would be to look for soem, more inter
boxable lines..tgheer must eb soem on the 0800/0500's..
(scuse my typing been on my holls and n0t used computer for about 3 weeks

That was a scam,yeah..but to my knowledge it doesnt work anymore...hmm...

get 10p and put it in the payfone,then belt the fuckin thing as hard as
you can wheer the blue piccies are....if ya coin copmes out then all
should be kewl..
then hang up and put a coin in again..make your call and just as ya creds
are about to go(well,when the nouise to tell ya they are comes on) press
follow on call and hit at as before yuor coin should come out and you've
got your call...a little limited I know..abvoiusly you can use quids etc
but best use 10p as it doesnt work on all phones..

It is now possible to purchase unlimited download credits and 60 minutes

as soon as we get enough money for my second phone line. I am still
having a few problems with high speed modems but hopefully this will be
sorted out in the near future. I feel 10.00 pounds is a fair price for
the amount of information available from this system.

Anyone know of some software that'll let me import mail from Demon into
Waffle (UUCP package on the PC) ? If not are there any cheap/free UUCP
feeds in the UK ?  I know I could card one but it needs to be permanent.

Does anyone read the Guardian OnLine supplement every Thursday?  I always
'borrow' it from the college library, on a long-term basis :-).  Anyway,
a while ago it had a thing on the Defcon II convention in Las Vegas, it
said stuff about the 'Most politically incorrect virus' award and a 'spot
the fed' compo.  Anyway, it said for further info. go by anonymous ftp to
cyberspace.com and look in /pub/defcon.  Just thought I'd let you all
know about that, and can someone tell me how to use ftp, for when I can
call cyberspace again.  BTW, has anyone called cyberspace recently and
used irc?  Last time I did it told me that 'gohsts are not allowed on
irc'.

  Dark Fiber: what version of unix is it??  And if u want password
cracking software for unix there are a multitude of proggies available on
this bbs for various machines, have a look in the file section.  Saying
that, once you're on a machine then password-cracking is usually fairly
pointless, cos if theyve got any sense then the root password is probably
&^%^(*&) or something along those lines, and also even if u did manage to
crack the root password you prob wouldnt be able to use it unless your
account happened to belong to the 'wheel' group and/or your terminal is
defined as secure in /etc/ttytab.  If none of that makes any sense, read
some books/files on unix then ask some specific questions, there are some
very good books and files about if you have a dig..

What effect does everyone think Caller Line ID will have on Phreaking?
BT are introducing this year - they have already done it in Glasgow!!
As you probably know you can tell the exchange not to send your number out
to the subscriber you are calling by dialing 140 in front of the number
but your line info still goes into a "private" store in the distant
exchange.  The data is sent as V23 modem tones to distant subscriber - so
any modem can pick it up .....as long as you pay a fee to BT!!!

  From: Quasar [188]
  Time: Sun Jun 19 01:57:43 1994
Just something I was thinking about on the toilet, after being caught out
for change @ a payphone.
You need one of the credit card ones,  I slid my card in the slot, the
phone started dialing a number, I think to auth. my card, then after about
20 secs a voice came on saying to dial the required number.
If you recorded the DTMF tones and worked out, you would get the BT
free line, enter in a CC number (or using a modular-10 # generator) then
possibly the phone box ID then the number you want to dial, this would
then put the call thro.
When I was waiting to type in the # to call there was a stream of tones
going down the phone. Maybe this could work?! try it out and let me know?!
Byee

I've heard rumours that when you break a trunk, if you send a tone of
more than 3000Hz with the 2600, it still siezes, but BT's SCAN system
dosen't catch you, anyone know about this?  Cos if we find the new
routing codes and this 3000 thingy works, then it'll be just like the
good ole days!

 Title: ID...
  From: Archaos [104]
  Time: Sun Jun 12 23:35:19 1994
Here's and idea for fake ID ie. ID with a photo and date of birth...

In Scotland anyway, there is a card called a Young Scot card which allows
those between 16 and 26 to get discount at several shops etc. The good
thing is that it has your photo and date of birth (also name and expiry
date) and the date of birth is written by the card holer ie. yourself! So
it is easy to make it fake for whatever purposes you require. Dunno if you
can get a card like it in England (some thing similar) but it is porbably
easy enough to pretend you are a Scot as it is only an application form
that needs to be filled out...

Anyway, theres a tip for you underagers...

Because BT are going to give out account #s and PINs for 0898 #s, you
have to ask for a form to fill in to get an account.  I've been thinking,
would it be possible for someone to get an account in someone elses name
(i.e. a neighbours) then post in on here, then we could use those BBSs
with 0898 #s that have internet access and shit.

of the house)  i'm not 100% on this tho, but good luck!
BTW try seting up a PO BOX and say its your BUSINESS box, u get faster

Don't bother with a PO Box, anyone can phone the post office, give them

I think you're all getting the wrong idea around here. If you phone up and
order some goodies and give them the correct name, card number and expiry
date and tell them that your drop address is the card address then if the
value of the goods is over about 50 quid they will phone for an
authorisation code. When they phone as soon as they give the address that
you gave them the authorisation department will know it ain't the correct
address and the goods will not be sent. What you are supposed to do is
give all the correct details, card no, name, expiry date and the cards
correct address and then try to redirect the delivery. If you can't then
you just forget about it. Try Red Star, order the goods and then phone the
train station just before they arrive and say you'll call in for them.

Kixx, Nor have I ..but you have to think Things out well, if u do any
serious stuff, also use a fresh virgin card, Uk based, Aint sure if this
makes much difference, but it may look a bit odd, if u card something
using bank of iraq! or someother weird bank

That would only be ok if you were ordering small stuff that went by the
post office, but most pc stuff etc goes by carrier like business post,
which can not redirect usually, how ever in some cases you can pick up
stuff from the depot if when they call the person is not in

 Title: Diff addresses
  From: Pulse [176]
  Time: Mon Jun 13 23:15:58 1994
How often do the MO companies check addresses for orders ? I remember my
old man's Access used to have his bank branch for the cardholders address
and only very infrequently did shops phone back to say they wouldn't send
them. Even for a 450 quid printer I think...I have seen catalogs that have
order forms with 2 parts; one for the delivery address and one for the
cardholder's address. These are mainly catalogs for businesses but it
looks like it'd be a cynch to order from them. (they also stock some v.
nice equipment!)

Also, lastly, some catalogs, such as Viking allow 30 days to pay for the
goods. They set an account up for you when they send you the catalog tho,
so if I did it now I'd be billed at my address, but I'm sure you could
persuade them to set you up an account over the phone.

Later...

Right, here's the deal...

If you have the cardholder's address - you phone the MO shop, place an
order and ask them to send it to your work address/studio or something. If
they say no try elsewhere. Surely *some* shops would. But is there a
danger of them phoning you back at the cardholder's number ? As long as
you phone back later in the afternoon after they've called the CC checker
you can talk your way out of any sticky situation or cancel the order or
something. What do you think ?

PLS
