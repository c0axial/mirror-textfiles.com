Choosing a Monster BBS

  What exactly IS a "Monster BBS" anyway? The definition is unclear, but
when you find one it's obvious: a large number of nodes, disk storage
measured in Gigabytes rather than megabytes, and several CD ROMs.
  A Monster BBS should also be well-rounded; a variety of interests
should be represented. Numerous (registered) doors, a comprehensive
online chat system, many different networks, shareware distribution
sites and technical support are all key examples of the well-rounded
system. 
   Each month we'll take a look at a different Monster BBS to help you
choose the best overall system for you.

   What this system lacks in files, she makes up for in style.  No, there
isn't a ton of leech-o-rama to be found on FUN University.  So, if your
download finger is itching, this ain't the one for you.  However - and this
is a big "however" - Prodigy (until that ZIFFNET deal) hadn't files online,
either.
  Ahh, Prodigy.  Funny I bring that up.  If you aren't familiar with the 
kindergarten of online services, get yourself a free startup kit, and
have a look...
  Then, call FUN University.  I guarantee you'll enjoy yourself more, and
spend less money doing it.
  No, seriously!  The people at FUN have truly pushed RIP Graphics to the
limit.  We're talking full-mouse, clickie-pointie, VGA in your face, honey.
The pictures are so great (little campus-type buildings, theatre kiosks, 
funky little people pointing at menu selections), I almost forgot that I was
on a BBS, and not some commercial enterprise (psst, Prodigy, that means you).
  No more struggling to learn UNIX barebones commands just to read a few 
letters.  FUN University has Usenet (Internet) feeds galore.  The system 
is set up so well, that even in ANSI emulation, a compleat beginner should 
have no trouble navigating the message subs.
  If real-time interaction is your thing, check out FUN's simulations.  These
aren't your average RPG Door Games.  The SysOps have fashioned their sims 
after controversial and timely issues (gun control, abortion), taking "Role
Playing" to a much higher level.  Don't worry, though.  None of it is 
presented in tiresome means.  Someone over there knows how to play with
metaphors.  Note that FUN's simulations are billed separately.
  Other key points:  Online chat across 8 nodes, DOS and MAC file areas,
puzzler games (The Stumper of the Month, Mystery of Q), and voice support.
  FUN is fun.  FUN makes you think.  So, it's a little pricey, competing with
the big boys in cost.  They're competing with the big boys in service, too -
sometimes surpassing them.  Hey, who needs those other guys, anyway?
