BBSs are like mushrooms in spring - they seem to sprout up with every
rain, and suddenly, without warning, disappear into thin air.  There
are thousands of BBSs to use, and since you can't spend every waking
hour BBSing, you need to be selective in the system you choose to use.
Here's some helpful hints to guide you in selecting the BBSs you
utilize:

1.  The SYSOP.  You can tell a lot about the SYSOP without seeing the
    system in action.  As you log on, what is the flavour of the
    SYSOP's comments and prompts for answers?  If he/she nasty?  Does
    he/she give you the feeling that they believe they are God?  Does
    the SYSOP ask too personal questions, such as detailed information
    on where you work or live, your income or your sexual preferences?
    If so, don't bother completing the logon sequence - hang up and
    take your business elsewhere.

2.  Does the system provide adequate telecommunications support, such
    as a high enough baud rate?  Systems which don't provide at least
    9600 baud today are probably going to be VERY slow in terms of
    user activity, and slow systems are dead systems.  Is the system
    constantly busy?  If a system is constantly busy, either the
    system has too many users, the system doesn't restrict session
    times, or the SYSOP is constantly taking his/her system down
    to play games, do their homework, etc.  Regardless of reason,
    find another BBS to frequent.

3.  Does the SYSOP force you to suffer through endless screens of
    totally useless information, such as last N number of callers,
    lists of those who haven't uploaded enough (in the SYSOP's own
    opinion), lists of useless trivia such as "On this date in
    history..." and the like?  Are you forced to suffer through
    a seemingly endless list of "system messages" that date back
    more than a week or two?  Do it take more than 15-20 seconds to
    log on?  If the answer to any of these questions is "Yes", forget
    this system and hang-up immediately.

4.  Do the logon screens/prompts change frequently?  This can reek
    havoc on your attempts to fully automate your logon sequence via
    script files.  And it illustrates just how much of a plaything
    the SYSOP considers his/her system to be.  Again, forget these
    systems and go elsewhere.

5.  The name of the system:  If the SYSOP picks some space-faced
    name (Galacticom Gladiators or Space Base North, for example)
    or overly-cutesy name (Gina's Boutique or Dick's Doghouse),
    it will attract users of a similar mindset.  If this matches
    your mindset, continue to logon, otherwise hang up immediately.

6.  Does the BBS' name change with the weather?  This is indicative
    of a SYSOP who is about as stable as Jello.  Get your desert
    elsewhere...

7.  Does the system require users to maintain an upload/download
    ratio?  If so, move on - there are too many systems around
    which don't have such restrictions to have to bother with those
    which do.  Again, move on... quickly...

8.  Does the SYSOP allow "war-boarding", profanity and other trash?
    "War-boards" = "Kiddy-boards".  If you're a kiddy, great news!
    For the more mature user, dial another number and don't look
    back...

9.  Is the system well-policed?  For example, how old are the messages
    in the public forums?  If they are more than a month or two old,
    you really must reconsider the wisdom of using the system.  If
    they date back 4-6 months or more, boggie on... to another system.

10. Is the system well organized in a logical fashion?  Are there
    different topical SIGs/forums/message bases, or is everything
    tossed into one big bucket?  Same goes for the File Libraries -
    are they organized into logical areas, or will you be spending
    time weeding through files of no interest to you to find those
    which are?  Again, there is no need to have to suffer through
    a mess when there are so many BBSs around which are well-
    organized and well-policed.

    Conversely, does the system have a SIG/forum/message base for
    absolutely everything under the sun?  Are the SIGs/forums/
    message bases splintered too much?  (Example: SIGs for DOS, Batch
    Files, Disk Utilities, Keyboard Utilities, Memory Management
    Utilities, etc., rather than a single DOS SIG/)

11. Are the files online available for downloading packed with PKZIP,
    ARC or some other packer, or are they available ONLY in an
    uncompressed state?  Time IS money and uncompressed files take
    far longer to download.  The only general exception to this rule
    are GIF graphics.  If you can't get your downloads in packed
    format, look elsewhere.

12. Privacy of YOUR information:  Does the system allow users to gain
    access to the personal and usually VERY private information about
    its users, or is this restricted - available ONLY if the users
    elect to make the information available?  If you don't have
    complete control over your own personal information, hang up
    immediately.

13. What is the "theme" or purpose of the BBS?  If the purpose of the
    system is "stamp collecting" and you have no interest in stamp
    collecting, don't waste your time and that of others in trying
    to change the theme of the system.  Move on.  In contrast, if you
    ARE interested in stamp collecting, use the system to the max -
    its definitely in YOUR interest to support the system.

14. What is the user activity in the public forums/message bases?
    If there is little activity and the BBS has been around for more
    than 2-3 months (i.e., the system is NOT just starting up and
    gaining recognition), move on.  Again, a slow system is a dead
    system.

15. What is the age of the SYSOP?  Many youngsters 9-15 go through
    the stage where they absolutely MUST be the SYSOP of their own
    system.  Its genetic.  A FEW of these systems are run by mature
    young men/women, but most are just passing fancies and thus the
    systems will be online for 3 months or less.  Especially when
    Mom and Dad decide to punish Junior for getting that D in Math.
    If you use such systems, just don't be surprised one evening
    when you call and the Ma Bell Electronic Lady tells you "The
    number you have reached has been disconnected."

16. Does the system provide the transfer protocol(s) of choice for
    today?  For example, currently ZMODEM is the protocol most
    popular, and for good reason.  Does the system offer ZMODEM?

17. Network mail.  So-called BBSs which offer network messages are
    not BBSs in the original sense.  Network BBSs tend to be "just
    another node" and don't have the local intensity and don't
    foster the spirit of comraderia that truly local BBSs do.  This
    is NOT to say that network systems are not worth using - quite
    the contrary.  If you need to get electronic mail to someone
    in another state and are too cheap to subscribe to CIS, GEnie,
    America Online, etc., and you don't mind exchanging electronic
    mail at a snail's pace, they are just your cup of tea!  But if
    you desire the spirit of a local system, network nodes are not
    going to satisfy you.  Personally I prefer local BBSs and
    Reach Out America - time is more valuable than money to me,
    so I pay the few cents to get my mail to someone instantly
    rather than wait a week to get the mail there and get the
    reply back.  Just personal preference...  But, if the network
    BBS is charging you for each message sent out on the network,
    go elsewhere, period.

18. The spirit of the users.  What makes a BBS is the quality of its
    users.  If the users are mature, friendly, knowledgable and
    outgoing, the system will be hopping and you'll get the most
    from it.  If, on the other hand, the system fosters users who
    only want to logon and take downloads, forget forging any
    friendships or getting much help, such as answers to your
    questions.

19. Hours of operation:  Is the system available 24 hrs/day, 7 days/
    week?  If not, forget it; the SYSOP isn't committed to running
    a solid system if he/she doesn't spring for at least ONE
    dedicated line, and why should you have to rearrange your life
    around the system's availability?  Such systems never last very
    long.  Mushrooms in spring...

20. Is the system easy to use?  In other words, are the commands
    logical and make sense?  Or are they Unix-like, cryptic and
    Greek?  If you need to download a manual to learn the system,
    forget it - go read a nice novel and get some enjoyment in
    life!  If you are on the system for 3 min and still haven't
    mastered the commands, Alt-H and dial another system.

21. Is the system free?  If not, be absolutely sure what you're going
    to be getting for your money BEFORE you ship the cabbage.  There
    are thousands upon thousands of BBSs which are free, and if a BBS
    is going to charge you for your use of the system, make darn sure
    they are going to be providing you with something than you can't
    get for free further down the road.  Also know that many of the
    BBSs which have attempted to go the subscription route have failed
    miserably and either folded altogether or have reverted back to
    being a free, public-access system.  If the pay-for-use system
    you are considering goes back to being a free system, will you
    get your money back?  If the system goes offline permanently, will
    you get your cabbage refunded?  Chances are the answers to both
    questions are "No".

    Before you send in your money, the pay-for-use system should allow
    you some "free" connect time to investigate the system and the
    services it provides.  Unless you get some free time to investigate
    the entire system, move on.

This is by far NOT a comprehensive list of considerations to make
in selecting which BBSs you utilize, but it should provide you with
some elementary considerations as a start.  The key to maximizing
the benefits of using BBSs lies in being selective.  BBSs should
be places to go for learning, for getting public domain and
shareware files, for exchanging thoughts, for getting news and for
making friends who share some common interests (such as computers).
But most of all, BBSs should be FUN.
