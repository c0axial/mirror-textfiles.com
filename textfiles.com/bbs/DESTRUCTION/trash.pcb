    I know that you are all wondering how people manage to *Crash* a
board running under PC-Board 10.0, and here's how it's done.

          NOTE: This has all been taken from a successful attempt at
                crashing my board. Anyone who has any further questions
                can contact me at (914)297-8726. This has all been
                printed out on my printer (They, of course, initiated a new
                callers log hoping that no one would find out thier secret.)

DUMBNESS: First off, I would like to express to you how dumb a Hacker can be.
          This was all done in broad daylight (1:30 to 1:51 pm to be exact).


SMARTNESS: They did, however, page the sysop first, so if he was there, theyed
           just postpone it until tommorrow. They also packed the users twice,
           so the backup created would be blank the second time.

HOW THEY DID IT: Here is how my Callers Log looked after they were done...

I know that this was not the Real Computerman, because he is:
    a) At school (I have winesses that say he was there)
    b) He owns a 1200 baud modem.
    c) even if he did, he knew that I was printing the Callers Log.

This guy is very strange (1:30 ????????????)
That's all the damage he did (he could have erased my whole HD)
