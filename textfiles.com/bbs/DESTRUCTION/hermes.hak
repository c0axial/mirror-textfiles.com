Hermes Back-Door (*RELEASE*)
=============================

1> FRANK PRICE'S BACK DOOR TO YOUR HERMES SYSTEM.

1>      As many of you already know, Frank Price has a way to get in your
Hermes BBS without your permission, or your knowing until he's done. Frank
Price can log on to your bbs at any time (with sysop access), and do whatever
he pleases. If you are using a serial number that doesn t belong to you, and
he finds out, he will call your bbs, and COMPLETELY trash it! I personally,
only know of a few (3 sysops) people who had this happen to them. They told me
that Frank Price logged on and became the sysop and t rashed the user list,
and then rendered the bbs useless. The sysops who had this happen to them
weren t using hacked copies of hermes, they got their copies from The Hermes
Support BBS (MT. Olympus, aka Frank Price's BBS), to make sure that their copy
wans't a hacked copy. Then after using the bbs for 30 days they decided that
they didn t want to pay $75 to obtain a serial# to register their copies of
hermes, so they managed to get a serial# from a friend and then continued to
use hermes *FREE* of charge. To make a long story short, somehow Frank Price
(creator of Hermes BBS) found out that they were using hermes bbs
illegitimately. So he called their systems up, and then trashed the bbs! Now
their systems are completely destroyed, and they are starting from scratch
again...*BUT* without Hermes. They decided to obtain 1st class and use that
instead. Now they are all content and vow never to look at hermes again. But
until a few weeks ago, I discovered that the three sysops above could have
possibly fallen victim to a hacker, instead of Frank Price. Apparently Frank
Price's buggie programming, has led a few to discover a few BACKDOORS, in the
software. I have seen numerous claimings of users who claim that they know of
a backdoor in hermes......This is most likely true......

TO BECOME A SYSOP ON ANY HERMES BBS DO THE FOLLOWING: (v1.7->2.0)
     1> Logon as a new user, with the name Frank Price III.
          Phone number: 213-275-6975
          password: //SYLIST
          (ALL OTHER INFO DOESN'T MATTER..computer type,DOB,ect.)

2> At the main menu type //OPENTEMP

3> Now the bbs will freeze up for 10-15 secs,while it loads the official Frank Price account. Then you ll see the regular hermes prompt dissappear. Now you can do whatever you like, because your now the sysop of that bbs. If you have no idea what to do just type '//?', and you'll get a list of all the remote sysop commands including a new option called '//XAMIN'. This command will let you delete, restore, or edit the userlist. You will also see an option that will let you d/l the Hermes Shared file. ('//DSH
ARE')

4> If you try this and it doesn't work, just be patient....When I 1st discovered the above info, it t ook me about 10-15mins to get it to work.

NOTE: AT RANDOM WHEN TRYING THE ABOVE SOMETIMES THE BBS WILL HANG YOU UP
(THE ABOVE INFO HAS BEEN PROVEN ACCURATE ON AT LEAST A DOZEN HERMES BBS's)
