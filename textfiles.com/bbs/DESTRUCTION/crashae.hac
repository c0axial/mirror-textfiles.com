Here it is, how to stop and how to crash ae's! written by ----->
Delta-Master, thanx to the new micro mofia, and THE Resistance...

1: GO TO INSTALL..... NOW SELECT SUPRESS KEYS..
2. HIT CTRL -L	AND
3. OH YES CTRL-H AND THAT WILL DO...

<>Also put in the character which will turn on the buffer and autosave and
destroy the person's ae!!!   which is:  ^R
WELL THIS IS FOR LITTLE COMPUTER PUSSIES.. THAT DON'T KNOW HOW TO WORK AN
APPLE..

WELL NOT LET'S MOVE UP A DEGREE TO A ASSTHAT MAKES HIS LIVING CRASHING AE'S...

(THIS TYPE DON'T HAVE APPLE... PROB. TIMEX SINCLAIRS 1000 OR HAHAHA I.B.M.'S PC
"JR")

WELL FOR assholes LIKE THIS WHO KNOW ASPENT THEIR LIFE READING AE INSTRUCTION
MANUAL.... WE HAVE TO GO TO ASSEMBLY...

well, i'll leave it off here, but 1 last thing(I forgot how to fix it..in mach
ine code i'm sure..) you type:

V>iew:			  (15 or so spaces)

then press return..that should fuck him up bad! Another is if he has an ae
working on a pw system, you type ctrl-y and that should put you into machine
lang(*), but it doesn't have DOS so you can upload a copy of DOS(in machine
code, i'll make a copy of it for ya guys soon) and then init his disk or
something

latur,
