            "WaReZ d00dz and H/P/A/V: A Failing Mixture"
                           by Mr. Sandman
                              08/21/93

       I have noticed a very sad thing occur recently. Wares and
  H/P/A/V have mixed together on the same boards and this has damaged
  rather than helped the scene. I never really thought this was bad
  at first but what I've started to notice is that most Wares Boards
  have started to advertise that they are also H/P/A/V to either
  attract more callers or so the sysop can feel like he is a complete
  BaD aSS because not only does he have WaReZ but he also has H/P/A/V
  which makes him "MoRe Elite" than most other boards. This is crap
  and is really hurting the scene.
       Nothing pisses me off more when I see a board advertising
  H/P/A/V support, CCInet, NuKE, etc. and yet it is totally geared
  towards Wares so no matter how much you know about the H/P/A/V
  scene you will not be granted access to the board because the users
  and sysops favor the WaReZ d00dz. This is really quite sad because
  there are less and less total H/P/A/V Boards almost every year and
  you have to have Wares in order to enjoy the H/P/A/V scene. I am
  not saying that this is true with all Wares/HPAV Boards but it
  seems to be true with most at the moment. For example, I have not
  had access to CCInet ever since High Voltage went PD.And sad to say
  you had to have an abundance of Wares in order to gain access to
  High Voltage in order to gain access. The only reason I had access
  there was because I helped him set up his BBS from day one when he
  had about five users. Then there was one other board in the same
  areacode that used to carry both Wares and H/P/A/V who did not
  discriminate towards any user if they knew what they were talking
  about. Unfortunately he went down. The use of improper Infoforms is
  to blame for most of this. When I see a BBS advertising H/P/A/V and
  it's New User Voting Infoform only has questions pertaining to the
  Wares scene I think it is really unfair to the good H/P/A/V User.
  It does not give him a chance to prove his worth to the BBS and the
  Users will normally vote him off. Personally, I see no excuse for
  having an unbalanced Infoform if you are supporting both Wares and
  H/P/A/V because it is hurting the scene. If you are a sysop and you
  run a BBS which carries both Wares and H/P/A/V then please balance
  your Infoforms. If you don't then it looks like you really don't
  give a shit about the H/P/A/V users and are only using H/P/A/V to
  make your BBS look á’ddEr than the others.
       The other thing which has really started to bother me is when
  Wares Boards or Wannabe Wares Boards start advertising that they
  have an abundance of H/P/A/V when they really have jack shit and
  don't ever care if they get any H/P/A/V files. Once, you have
  called you have accomplished their goal because you have made their
  BBS look one user bigger. For example, I called another Wares BBS
  recently, which shall remain nameless, which was advertising that
  it had CCInet and loads of H/P/A/V. When I gained access the
  first thing I did was go to the message section. All the users were
  complete WaReZ d00dz and the subs that dealt with Wares were
  thriving. Then I reached one sub titled "H/P/A/V Discussion" which
  had one post by the sysop explaining what it was for and then all
  the remaining posts were d00dz warring with each other. I was so
  pissed to see the one thing I called for which I expected to be
  somewhat intelligent being used as a warring sub. Then my Message
  Scan ended and I hadn't hit any subs that were on CCInet. I paged
  the sysop and when he broke in he said that he didn't have it yet
  but he knew that he could get it if he asked for it. I was really
  pissed off at that point but I hadn't yet checked out the file
  section so I kept my cool and went into it. He had a great supply
  of Wares but the thing that surprised me most was that he had only
  ONE FILE dealing with H/P/A/V which was on how to build a Gold Box.
  At this point I was so pissed I chatted with him again and totally
  went off on him. The dick started calling me a lamer and tried to
  make me look like I'd done something wrong. He then proceeded to
  tell me that if I didn't upload him a new Ware he would revoke my
  access to the board. Using the Nowhere Utilities I disguised the
  Crazy Trojan as a Ware and gave it to him. I know he ran it because
  Balin later called back the board and he posted a Bulletin about it
  yet this did not help solve the problem. It was merely one asshole
  who just started everything over again after he reformatted his HD.
  I have even less respect for these losers so if anyone runs across
  another board like this send a virus or trojan their way for me. If
  a BBS is actually trying to get a good H/P/A/V section then it
  won't require you to upload Wares. If they required uploads of
  H/P/A/V to keep access to their board, even if they only had a few
  H/P/A/V files or posts you would at least know that they were
  genuine about wanting to get a good H/P/A/V board going because you
  would be contributing to the board. However, if they require you to
  upload a Ware then you know where their mind is.
       The only other problem I've noticed that is also hurting the
  scene are the egos among H/P/A/V and Wares Users who think they are
  greater than everyone and were born with their knowledge and never
  had to learn everything. If someone with less experience posts a
  message like, "What does a Red Box do?" or, "What does INC stand
  for?" they are immediately attacked by these egotistical users in
  the subs who insult them and call them lamers. This doesn't help
  anything. We all know that those of us who do know what we are
  talking about had to learn at one point what all these things stood
  for and what their functions were. We didn't just know it! And that
  is why we should not belittle someone because they don't know what
  something is because it doesn't help the situation. If someone asks
  a basic question like that why not just give them the answer
  instead of giving them an attitude. It will help out everybody much
  better in the long run.
       I am not going to point the finger at any BBS's in this file
  for doing anything that I mentioned above because that was not the
  purpose of this file. However, if you happen to be the Sysop or a
  User on a BBS that commits what I've expressed dislike to in the
  above then please change your BBS to meet the above or have a talk
  with the sysop about what I've said. If we could get the Wares and
  H/P/A/V Community to truly come together then so much more could be
  accomplished. Please take into consideration what I've said in this
  file.
