left your msg on other boards.  I'm sure there are boards that acutally
specifically cater to the Commodore line.  You are just not likely to get
an answer here.

to DAVID JOHNSON re: R/STATIC

  I'm not on or near static - that is kind of the surprise!  However,
I think this might be clothing related.  I also have a plastic floor
protector under this chair.
  A friend, Mike Warot, bought me a Radio Shack thermoneter/humidistat,
so it will be interesting the NEXT time I sense some static (hopefully
without zapping some components!) to see what the humidity is!  Also
I should perhaps spray the wool chair seat with static guard.
  Meanwhile I'm grounding myself before touching my laptop or hooking up
the Wizard Link.

  Well, "no trouble found" was the analysis of my Toshiba when it was out
in California for repair!  Sure enough, I hooked it up to Lap Link, it
worked perfectly!
  Since when can a zapped serial port start working again??  I tried the
SAME cable on the SAME system, it didn't work!  Also I tried just using
a comm program on another machine - it wouldn't even receive - though
it would send!

I have Qemm installed w/dos 5 on my 386SX system. Currently I have
have 647K memory free, and am looking to get a high loadable menu
program so that I can get about 680K of free conventional memory.
But I can't find a hi-loadable menu program. Anyone know of one
out there? While we're at it, why can Word Perfect and other
application programs be loaded loaded high?

to ROY LIPSCOMB re: FAST STEP RATE

Roy,
   Actually, the only reason the standard AT ships with a step rate of 6 ms
is to maintain compatibility with a wide variety of drives.  If your
particular drives are capable of a faster step rate then you might as
well use it.  It's typical of IBM not to allow user-configurability of
such things, although I've seen a couple of fancier clone BIOSes that
do.

Msg 45203 is 07 line(s) on 11/02/91 from DAVID JOHNSON
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/STATIC

Hmmm, that is surprising.  Perhaps the wool chair is the culprit, with
your clothes.  The humidity test should prove interesting, I think that
both our guesses would be that it will be low.  As far as grounding, what
method do you use?  I've heard (and used) that touching the fan grill
before opening the case works.  In any case, good luck with your systems,
and glad to hear that the Toshiba is ok.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/STATIC #2

I've had some bizarre COM: port problems lately, too, one of which
matches yours (sends but won't receive). In that particular case, I
found a strange contention for the port under a multitasking
environment. My only solution so far has been to close down the
program in the inactive window....On one specific day I couldn't
do file xfers even though all text communications worked fine. What was
so strange was that I had precisely the same problems when I altered
every element involved--changed modems, cables, software, and computers.
Even tried restoring a known good back-up. I ended up xferring stuff to
CIS as straight ASCII the rest of the day. Next day, all went well. :-)

A few Commodore BBSes and stores exist in the Chicago area, though I'm
not directly in touch with them anymore. Try leaving a message to "ALL"
on a system I run. A couple of callers there still play with C-128s in
their free time and probably would be able to meet your needs. Also, as
you log on, note carefully the instructions to access the various BBS
lists we maintain. using the SEARCH facility, you should be able to
identify BBSes in the 312 and/or 708 area codes with a special interest
in Commie machines. Here are the details for calling:

if I really have enough to tell you about the center to justify a lot of

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: STATIC...

Ward,
  I have found that statis is a big problem come April & October.  The
number of calls I get regarding 'hung' computers and 'parity errors'
jumps 10 fold.  While statis guard spray works, it is very expensive, and
it is vacuumed away with the cleaning staff nightly.  I don't remember the
source, but I have people get a spray bottle ( a nice one, adjustable
nozzle), and fill it with 1part Downy fabric softener to 2 or 3 parts water
and spray this instead of static gaurd.  It works the same and is a lot
less expensive.
   I have found serial ports freezing for a period of time.  Sometimes
removing them from the board and then replacing them works. (OK hardware
guru's.. is there some capacatence built into the 1488/89 chips and/or the
circuits that drive them ?)

Other than to get the free upgrade to OS/2 Version 2.0, is there any good
reason to go out and buy OS/2 1.3?  To date there has been relatively little
software for OS/2, with the huge market for Windows.  Can you run Windows
under OS/2?  Is there any evidence at the present time to tell whether or
or not IBM will be able to deliver on the promises that they have made for
OS/2?  In talking to IBM to request liturature, the lady stated that the
failure of OS/2 Ver. 2.0 to run any Windows or IBM software would be con-
sidered a bug in OS/2 itself.

I'm running OS/2 due to an application specific requirement! Unless you
have a reason to move to OS/2 I wouldn't!.  To be specific, there isn't
any software utilities (ie..Norton, Copyiipc, backup, modem program that
run under OS/2. I've call ALL the software manufactures that currently
produce software to support the DOS enviroment and they say they either
have no plans to support OS/2, or are waiting to see what the market will
do. Personnally, It's frustrating to be able to do anything I what on my
DOS system, and I'm very limited under OS/2.
If you move to OS/2 you pay full price! There is no break or discount if
you move from DOS to OS/2.
Best of wishes in your plight....

I have a whole working machine, and might be willing to sell it.
It's not a 620, it's a Xerox Computer Services internal equivalent
to the 620, plus some ribbons and print wheels. If interested, let
me know. I think it is referred to as 1330, or 1320 some such.
Essentially the same machine, however.

to GAYLAND BLOETHE re: R/WHY OS/2 VERSION 1.3?

Yes is the answer to your questions. OS/2 2.0, in it's final version
will run DOS, Windows, (probably Desqview), and OS/2 sessions
simultaneously. IBM will deliver on the promise. I run DOS and OS/2
sessions together now under OS/2 1.3. If you install OS/2 properly
you don't have to give up anything. I regularly boot up under DOS 5.0
and then switch to OS/2. I am communicating now using an OS/2 commo
program similar to Qmodem, called Logicomm. This is an OS/2 session.
I also run windows 3.0 when "over on the DOS side". Actually, the
real answer to your question is "because it's there".
