COHERENT REPLY,BURR
Greetings Bill,
   I sent Gary Clark a message (#44441).  I placed some info for you
in it also. (1-27-91)  Let me know if you purchased it already, and
how you like it.

POSSIBLE SWAP,
Tony--I have an Apple II+ with two disk drives that I might be
willing to consider swapping with you.	I don't know a lot about
the Amiga 1000, but here's what I have been looking for:  My son
would like a computer with some kind of simple CAD software for
designing cars, motorcycles, etc.  He doesn't use the Apple II+
much anymore.  Do you know if there is any such software available
reasonable cheap for the Amiga?  Also, I presume that you are talking
about an Amiga without a monitor.  True?  If so, what kind of color
monitor would the Amiga require (or for that matter, monochrome)?
I have monochrome monitors around here.  I'm a bit reluctant to part
with the Apple II+ for sentimental reasons.  It was my first computer,
but on the other hand, they're not too hard to find.  Give me a call
at (708) 352-7415 if you want to talk about it.

UNIX QUESTION,@@@@
We have two UNIX hosts on the same network running TCP/IP. We want to be
able to mount the file system of one to the other. Any ideas?

UNIX QUESTION,
You would need to be more specific as to your hosts, but in general,
you can use either RFS (Remote File System) or NFS (Network File System).
Each has its advantages and disadvantages. NFS is typically easier to
setup and run, however, it is not as safe as RFS. If you are looking
to run a database which your business relies on use RFS, if you are
looking to share some files informally, NFS would probably be best. What
machines and applications you are running make a difference. For example,
I don't think you can get RFS on a SUN, or the application you are
running may take into account that it may be running on NFS and insure
that data has successfully been written over the network. If you have
further questions, you can drop me a note at stox@balr.com, or

CD ROM & BIG DB?,
  A customer is wanting to convert a mainframe application to PCs, and it
requires a 300-400 meg database.  They want to master their own CDs, and
update them fairly often (say, every 2 months, just guessing).
  They'd probably stage the data to hard disk from CD-ROM for speed of
access - the data could be "batched" so that maybe 3-5% of the database
could be looked at one time.
  I think they sort of want to write their own access method - they don't
want any "tie-ins" etc.
  Any thoughts on this?
  Thanks!

R/CD ROM & BIG DB?,
1) If they're planning to master an new CD every two months, they must have
money to burn.	Also, I wonder what the lead time on CD-ROMS is.  Are
they going to be able to keep up?
2) Remember that although CD-ROM drives can transfer data very fast,
they have miserable seek times (ca 500ms!).  If they're going to do
any kind of random access searches, they'd do better to copy the entire
CD-ROM to a hard disk and do the searches there.

FRAUDIGY PART 2,
Although I have not tested this yet, but it is said that if you take
a brand new Prodigy software package and install it on a brand new
floppy even though you have a hard disk as drive C:. It will pull
information off your hard disk and place it in the STAGE.DAT file
even before you log on for the very first time.

Someone who works on the inside of Prodigy as a columnist admitted
that Prodigy does pull information from your system and does so
legally because if you read your on-line agreement closely, it says
that you sign all rights to your computer and its contents to
Prodigy, IBM & Sears when you agree to the service. Well that is all
very interesting... wouldn't you agree? <BW>

RE/COPH-2 BBS NUMBER CHANGE,NONO
It would be helpful if you were to indicate the location of the central
office to which COPH BBS has moved.  The phone book indicates that the
436 prefix is in the Prospect district which puts it into the "B" zone
for callers from the North side Lakeview and Kildare exchanges, whereas
it was in the "A" zone under the old phone number.   The phone company
operator and business office (a lady who identified herself as "Mrs. Bell")
refused to tell the location as "company information only."
  (It happens to be on Chicago's South Side.)
  The information is important to callers who won't realize they have
been calling a "B" "C" or "D" zone until they see a phone bill
at month's end.
  Will people who call both Chinet on its guest line (312-283-0559)
and COPH at its new location (312-436-0559) encounter a problem when
trying to recall which is which?
