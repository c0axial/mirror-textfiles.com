  You didn't say how much memory you devoted to your cache.  If your
application exceeds your cache space (some default to 64K, which is not
worth the trouble) then you won't see an improvement of any significance.
  I for example on my communications machine, have a 384K cache.  This
allows many applications, such as communications, and editors working on
moderate sized files, to work very quickly.
  You may want upwards of a meg of cache if you have the memory for it
and if your applications are large enough to need it.
  Another thought is that your application is CPU bound, and thus you're
stuck - CACHE won't help - what you'd need is for example an AOX (Waltham,
MA) upgrade - they have a small 386SX upgrade for the model 60 that should
help quite a bit.
  Another thought is that if you don't have a math co-processor, you are
requiring extensive CPU power doing software floating point.  A math
co-processor might be your most cost-effective upgrade.

I just upgraded to DOS 5.0 and none of my old utilities

Any tips will be greatly appreciated.....Lynn

Are there any solutions other than going back to DOS 3.3 ??, or are ther any

  That is AMAZING!  I have about 50 utilities, ranging from Stackey,
to Pcopy, DX, TreeView, Command Editor, clock fixes, keyboard speeder-
uppers, etc.
  I haven't switched to DOS 5 yet, but I FAR from expect ALL of them
to stop working!
  Have you tried using the "setver" command?
  Could you give me an example of say a half-dozen of the utilities that
have stopped working?  Perhaps we can analyze what is wrong.  This is
truly amazing.
  ...OR... perhaps you meant to say "my DISK utilities such as Norton
and PC tools" but you just said "NONE of my old Utilities work".  Utility
is too generic a term.  Please be specific.

A friend has an Apple IIc (about which I know nothing) that I'd like to
set up as a terminal for calling BBSs.  Are there any free or shareware
communications program for the IIc?  If so, is there anyone on the north
side of Chicago that would be willing to provide a disk copy of same?
Please leave a message here, or give me a call anytime after Monday,
Aug 26.  (312) 274-0531.  Thanks much.

Ward, one util that I know has real rpoblems is PMAP134.  Even with
SETVER chenged to include PMAP and telling it that it's looking at DOS3.3,
still has hernias.

Msg 45074 is 13 line(s) on 08/21/91 from LYNN ANDERSON
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/BEST UTILITY PROGRAM?

Ward, you're right most utils will work.  For example I have
PC Tools ver 1.10 and it works ok, except that I can do everything
it does faster from DOS Shell.  The problem seems to lie in programs
which use FAT (just a SWAG).  For example Norton 4.01, Disk
Optimization Ver 1.3, Disk Manager Ver. 4.3, and a generic memory
checker do not operate.

I've been looking at Norton 6.0 and PC Tools 7.0 the features of these
versions have far more features then do the programs I have circa 1985.
I'm just not sure which I should buy? Or if I should instead buy a
variety of individual utils.

Lynn...

I don't really know, Phil.  It just seems that all of the online services
available now are run by greedy moneysuckers who concentrate on new,
IMPROVED! ways of charging you extra for every conceivable item of
interest.  It would be nice if there was a simple, cheap, clean, and
fast national service that just had basic BBS type services and file
availability without a lot of extra charges for "extra" services.
Hmm.
