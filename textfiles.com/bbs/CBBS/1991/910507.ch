 A Unix-based solution is definitely appropriate - EXCEPT that they've
got custom-written RBBS/PC based programs, and have a July 1 deadline. They
just don't have the luxury of starting from scratch.

Msg 44714 is 24 line(s) on 05/03/91 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to RICHARD HINTON re: R/BIX OR COMPUSERVE

 Bix is definitely cheaper - you can get a fixed rate deal with Tymnet,
and a fixed-rate deal with BIX. With CIS, your phone calls are cheaper
because they have their own network node in Chicago, but the connect
charges are significantly higher.
 BIX is really a big BBS - run informally, and if you like that, that
could be a plus. CIS is run more formally, and I like that.
 CIS has a LOT more formal vendor support forums - the list is HUGE. I've
dealt with Microsoft, Aldus (Pagemaker), Digital Research, Computer Lang.
Mag, DDJ, the entire PCMAGNET, Magee (Treeview & Automenu), Mansfield (Kedit),
the Super PC Kwik folks, etc.
 BIX has the Periscope company, and probably quite a few others, but not
as many as BIX.
 BIX access number: I'd just call 1-800-555-1212 and ask for BIX. I'm
sure I see a customer service # every time I call, but I don't keep
my logon info.
 Bix has a couple plusses in that (1) msgs tend to stay around a long long
time; and (2) you can "file read ref all" to put all new msgs in all
conferences you subscribe to, into a file, then download (xmodem 1K).
 CIS has better ogranized and more searchable download libraries, and has
people who do nice things like creating one-liner description files for
all the files in the download sections.
 It really is a tough decision. I'm quite active on both. If someone said
I had to choose, I would definitely choose to stay on Compuserve - I like
its more formal nature, but BIX.well, I'd sure hate to give either up.

 Can I change the default font in Word for Windows? I can't seem to find
how (and now can't seem to find my manual). It defaults to Times Roman,
but I don't HAVE that. I have either Adobe Type Manager, or Bitstream
FaceLift, so my default font is one of their fonts.
 Thanks for any ideas.

 Gee, I LOVE my Sharp ZQ-5200 (Not actually called a "Wizard", but
nevertheless a smaller version of the big Wizard, and with a couple of
its program cards built-in, but no memory expansion (both have PC link
capabilities).
 The to-do list has priorities, and a "Manager", and "Project" field. You
can arbitrarily assign text strings to both, but I'm having trouble
figuring out what to put there. I've tought of one being "place" (e.g.
"at home", "at work" "Home or work", "APCU Meeting", and the other being
some kind of activity (phone call, mail letter, write check, etc).
 Curious if anyone else has this.
 If anyone has any questions about this G-R-E-A-T product, just ask. (But
I don't have the PC link yet - it was back ordered).

to ALL re: WHO OWNS DOS?

Ward (or any knowledgable person),
 Who currently owns DOS aka PC-DOS or MS-DOS. I was my understanding that
IBM owned PC-DOS 4.0 and licensed it to MS. Now I hear that IBM has sold
all right for DOS to MS and is getting out of the DOS operating system
business. Is this correct?
 I always thought IBM support of PC-DOS 4.0 was good. The CSD's were
easy to get via IBMLINK etc. If MS is in charge of DOS does that mean
we won't be seeing PC-DOS 5.0?
Thanks,

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/DISK COMPRESS

 Bought Stacker, read the manual and took it back. Looks OK for
general programs but 1) I can't loose the memory it uses; 2) I
have pgms setup with "drive" specifications so the change however
it does it with the EXTRA drive designation screws me up. It
could also mess up paths with programming. Having the system
re-designate drive letters can cause problems inside pgm
paths.
 Oh well. Maybe one HD will blow and I will have to get a bigger
one.

Msg 44720 is 12 line(s) on 05/04/91 from DAVID JOHNSON
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/DISK COMPRESS

This may not exactly fit what you're looking for, but there's a program out
(shareware/PD) that will allow you to compress any/all files on the hard
drive. When the files are accessed, it automatically uncompresses them.
Also, when invoked, the program will compress any files not accessed after
a period of time that you can set. You can also tell the pgm what files to
not touch, which files to compress that meet a certain space savings, etc.
The program is called PCMANAGE.ZIP You should be able to find it on one
of the BBS's. If not, leave me a message and we can arrange a transfer
thru a common BBS (you're on American Archives, right? How about Round
Table?). Hope you find what you're looking for.

I just wanted to drop you a line to say that I saw the recent
(April) issue of Boardwatch Magazine. Being new to the area
of BBSing, I was most impressed with the inventiveness which
went into the development of this system and, likewise, to the development
of XMODEM. Given the time that has elapsed since, it seems almost
remarkable that the majority of comm. protocols devised since your
work on XMODEM have used the same basic principals. To find, first hand,
the essential history of this endeavour which has become so much a part
of my day to day life is quite an experience for me. I thank you for
all that you have given the on-line community.

to ALL re: SCOPE RENTAL NEEDED

I just completed a fairly long browse through the yellow pages in search
of a compnay that rents electronic equipment. I did not see anything
Specifically, I am looking for a scope in the range of about 100Mhz for
a day. Can anyone point me to a compnay that rents test equipment?

Msg 44723 is 11 line(s) on 05/06/91 from CLIFF SHARP
to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/SCOPE RENTAL NEEDED

 There are several, listed in the Business (C) book for Chicago under
Electronic Testing Equipment. I heard good things about ElectroRent
(708-350-2222), but they screwed up badly on us; I've heard good about
Genstar Rental Electronics Inc. (800-323-8964) and haven't tried them;
and I got pretty good results (but lukewarm recommendations about)
Leasametric Inc. (800-553-2255).
 One day with a piece of test equipment is gonna cost you, though.
Some of these places seem to imply that they rent by the month. I
suggest you ask friends; I was able to borrow a 100 MHz scope some time
back from the unlikeliest person I knew (a software-only jock I knew
had a very nice B&K, for what reason I don't know).

You need to load the normal.dot file into the editor. then change
the NORMAL style to the font you want. then save it (normal.dot).
Don't assume your system has crashed when it takes a long time for
normal.dot to save. that's normal (but of course). The next time
you open a new document, you will have the new font.

Oh yeah. you will find the normal.dot file in the w4w directory.

to ALL re: COMMUNICATIONS HELP!

 Subject: Mysterious problems with Carbon Copy setup.

Help. I am in depsrate need of a solution to this problem.

One terminal on a PC network is a dedicated comm terminal. It runs carbon copy
and one of several remote sites calls daily to update information.
Once every two-three weeks, the host machine would lock-up, requiring a
re-boot. But in the main, all worked well.
Then chaos struck. In one week, the following changes occurred:
 1) Arcnet net changed to Ethernet and re wired.
 2) Comm terminal replaced with CompuAdd 286-20.
 3) 2400 b everex modem replace with Pract Periph 9600SA.
 4) Dedicated phone line replaced splitting device to allow
 modem its own line free from other demands and interference.

Now any callers get hung-up on mid-session, or occassionally the
host machine freezes and then hangs up. Whichever comes first, the
host does not recognize the disconnection, and freezes.

Now, lest you think I do not know what I am doing, I have covered all
the bases. The net card has been set to different inyterrupts. The old
modem was put back in. The pc was switched. The same set-up that preciously
worked was set-up on the line. All combos of hardware/software have been
tried. Carbon Copy was told to hang up if it detects 30 seconds of
no communication (still freezes). Illinois Bell has checked the line
for proper grounding or other problems. All OK. Yet the problem Still Persists
Please offer suggestions. (Preferably ones I did not think of)
