to PHIL SCHUMAN re: R/3270 FILE TRANSFER

  ind$file handles the transfers in two ways:  In CUT mode, they do some
sort of escape char i.e. send 2 bytes for one - or even nibblize the
whole thing, not sure.  In DFT mode it can be sent transparently,
i.e. 8-bit.
  With DFT it can apparently "do something" (I know not at all what) but
to go on as if I did - like setting a "mode" indicating transparency,
and it then goes onto a block-by-block basis.
  Tempus Link - which I worked with indirectly at JT Ryerson & Co, worked
nicely enough that what they did for setting up new machines was to have
a single diskette with FDISK, FORMAT, and enough of DOS and tempus link,
that they hooked to the mainframe and - what - XCOPIED - the rest of the
standard software setup down from the virtual host disk.  Oh, no, I
remember what - they hired a consultant to write a program that copies
only newer files or something like that.

  If I can be of any help - i.e. "what is the shortest way to get from
'a' to 'b' on Compuserve", don't hesitate to ask.
