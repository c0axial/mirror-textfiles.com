  Fonts?  What is it you want to use the DeskJet for?  I have to admit,
I've learned - and been burned - by fonts over the years.
  - Burned: wasted my money on "soft fonts" only to find the pain of DLing
them, while if I'd spent the same money on HARD fonts, I'd have had 'em
right at hand.
  - Learned: Well, from soft fonts, several things happened - among them
the DJ getting better built-in fonts - (it has a single-size Times font).
Also, as I purchased more and more Windows apps, I found myself first with
Bitstream Facelift, a scaleable soft font driver, then with Adobe Type
Manager - also a scaleable font manager - really works nicely!  Also,
the DJ driver that they supply with the 500C has scaleable fonts, but I
"think" it is over-ridden by Adobe - at least when I exported a font from
Corel Draw to Adobe, it showed up - something I don't THINK the HP driver
would do.
  PageMaker 4.0 came with one of the above 2 font managers - I'm not sure
where the other came from.  ATM seems pretty decent, but then again
Bitstream had some interesting fonts, too!

I just got the latest version of MicroEMACS for all those that are i
interested. Call my BBS at (708) 991-3894, search for "EMACS".

Well...I don't really know what I want to do. Resume's perhaps, I've
also thought I might be able to create letterhead in colors with the
500C. My big problem is not really understanding if I was going to be
buying a printer that might cause me to buy much more software at no
small cost in order to do stuff like that. I'm particularly attracted
to a font style called Garramond, and would like to be able to use it
on a printer like this. I'm gun-shy because I have a Toshiba P321
with several font cartridges, sheet feeder, tractor, etc. etc.
but it is seldom supported in software, and discontinued, although
an execellent printer until it jammed and broke a pin. Still good for
programming output, but not much else. I don't want to limit myself
any more than I have to or spend a lot on surprises.
No dup. chars.
