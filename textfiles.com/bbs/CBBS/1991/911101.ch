]HI!!!
i just signed on to your bbs and it is without a doubt the most difficult
bbs to use! i have signed on to many and yours takes the award for
the most difficult to read screens and archaic commands.
It sure does look like yours is the oldest BBS! I can tell by the software
you are using!(grin) Every other bbs i used has the same type of
menu system. perhaps u can take a look at some of these others and
adopt their menus or software.
in any case, i wanted to upload a file and i did not even see any letter
selection foir file area.
Oh well - on to the next bbs!!
bye for now!

 My friend and I (described in the above mentioned msgs) still have not gotten
any job offers in the software consulting field. If you hear of any openings,
please let me know. Please read messages 45094 and 45095 for our
qualifications. Thank you very much.

Sounds like your a prime candidate for a humidifer, Ward!
Zapped a comm board myself this week too. <sigh>

Msg 45194 is 06 line(s) on 10/31/91 from DAVID JOHNSON
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: STATIC

Another rather inexpensive protection against static (if you have your
computer on carpeting, or are working with it while standing on carpeting)
is to buy a can of Static Guard and spray it on the carpet/floor where
you are working, before you use the machine(s).  I've used this, and it
has worked for me.  A 6oz can costs about $2.99, and is available in most
Walgreens or grocery stores.
