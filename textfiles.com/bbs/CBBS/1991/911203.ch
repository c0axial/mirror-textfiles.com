]Hi Alex Zell:  This is Jean Barber typing now. Mike and I
are looking for your BBS listing.  See you have shifted it
elsewhare.  Lois and the boys were here this summer.  We did
not have time to get on the board.  Will try to make it a
point to get to you then.  They live in a small town in
Minnesota now and seem very happy.  Good to chat with you.
Jean Barber..

 Folks who have tried lately found the Beaverton place is out of biz.
 Another place I've seen in a recent Shopper is:"Disc
"Disc Drive Sales & Repair Center"

to ALL re: HP DESKJET 500 INKJET PRINTER

I would appreciate any thoughts, comments or recommendations anyone
can offer regarding this machine or the 500C. They are getting almost
affordable now and I'm looking for thoughts from present owners. For
example, what are surprising limitations, if any? Are there black-only
ink cartridges for the 500C? What do they emulate? Looks like you have
to buy a cartridge to emulate IBM Proprinter, or Epson. What is HP PCL
printer language? Are drivers available? What kind of paper do I REALLY
have to use? Etc., etc., etc.
