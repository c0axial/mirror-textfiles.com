Yes, I'd be quite interested in the Fido discussion. I'd welcome the msg
or two you say you have plus a fuller thread if anyone may have it....I
don't offhand recall whether you still have validated status over my way,
but I think your total number of calls probably has been high enough that
your validated status probably is intact. If not, please post a msg and
I'll revalidate quickly. (Put up a private msg indicating whether your
address/phone has changed and, if so, new info if you want "permanent"
validated status again. Otherwise, I'll build a temp validated status for
the current exchange to keep the user log trimmer. Whichever you prefer is
OK though.) Thanks....

Good input, thanx. Actually, your "part that doesn't apply" in some ways
offers the most interesting, albeit indirect comment received to date. I
well may be able to work it into the article despite the "indirect"
connection. Regards.

to MARTY DIPPEL re: FORTH

Hello.  Nope not doing anything with Forth although I still have my Rockwell
Forth chip handy.  I stop Forth with the Objected Oriented Forth and recently
began looking into Hyperscript; it has many elements of Forth and Lisp like
stuff.  I especially like the way it writes source code based upon then user's
movement and placement of buttons.
No dup. chars.
