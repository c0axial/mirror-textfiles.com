]Looks like you found a bug!  Somehow, a file was created that has an EOF
character in the last byte of the sector - not sure, perhaps it went to the
next sector, ... Heck, I have no idea.  But I think the fact that there's
a 1a in byte 128 indicates a possible problem.  Hmmm..

]Oh, OK, this was the known 'extent bug' in the CP/M emulator.  Somehow
the file gets over 16K, and WHAM, the emulator grabs big blocks of memory
and writes 'em to the end of the file.  I dl'd it, cleaned it up, and sent
it back - the next time we roll around to xxx42 and xxx43 we should be OK.
WARD CHRISTENSEN,

]__AHA! Since the extent bug was at fault, that meant your msg was THERE
just in the wrong place (e.g. after some EOF chars, @ the end of the file
after more garbage).  SO I resurrected both messages with an editor,
and then deleted the 2nd (as a dup of the first).
__Sorry for the problems.
