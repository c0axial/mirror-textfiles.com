I am awaiting word on whether I have to go in and retreive the files.
I have found the one sub-directory that I may need.  Your details
on recovery are just what I needed.  Thanks.

to ALL re: XEROX XP12E LASER PRINTER

I have acquired one of the above mentioned laser printers.  It seems that
it was possibly used as an output device on an NBI word processing
cluster of some nature.  In any case, I removed the external interface
(seems to be an ethernet to Centronincs interface) and have been
able to print text OK.  It has 2 fonts (landscape and portrait) in it.
I count 384K of ram and about 96K of rom.  It also has 4 font slots.
Now for the questions:does anyone has documentation on this printer, or
know where I might get them ( service, etc.) Any ideas where I can get
fonts to download into it (I believe the NBI systems could do this)
3rd:  Is there any chance in this world that it can be used with
Windows?

I acquired an Apollo DN560 workstation.  It may have been part of a
DN550 stsation (it had a disk & tape backup) or may be stand-alone.
It appears to have some form of token rign network card in it (
BNC in & BNC-out)  I am interested in just what this machine can or did do,
and what I may be able to do with it.  There are some roms in it labeled
BOOT, but I see no evidence of it ever having a disk drive.  It could have
booted off of a host.  Anyone with into on this thing, please leave a
message.

to ALL re: CORVUS/OMNINET/DRIVES

In the early 80's Corvus had the constellation series drives that used
a 34 pin flat cable and special adapters for various computers (Apple,
IBM, Mac, Commodore)  THe next thing they came out with was the
Omninet.
   Each drive has a 4 pin (net) connection as well as an address switch
on the back.  there is also an additonal 8switch dip inside the case.
How did these units hook-up to the computers, and what was the capability
of them.  If nothing else, I can pull the drive and use it in an XT
(it is a ST-506 interface)

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/BOOK

Ward: Thanks for the note. Unfortunately, Chinet has proven
a trial. Not the software, the log-on. I got in once as
a new user under Dana, again as a new user under Danab.
I found then that Dana was logged in with the correct
password as an existing user. Today I tried getting in as
Dana and Danab and was thrown off both times. So it goes.
The bottom line is I still haven't gotten the input I need
from Randy on the creation of CBBS and what has happened since.
But I promise to keep trying. If he can post something here,
just stating what he was doing in January, 1978 -- who
he was working for, in what capacity, etc -- and his own
view on how he met you and what got CBBS rolling -- then
our chapter will be quite satisfied.
Thanks again for all your help. IT was a pleasure meeting
you here in Atlanta!

answer.  He doesn't call CBBS any more.

Msg 44860 is 11 line(s) on 06/19/91 from BILL WOLFF
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/FAT TABLES /REBUILDING

I understand how the Commodore disk format works by saving each file
link within each sector. The BAM (MS-DOS' FAT) only stores which sectors
are being used and that's all. How does MS-DOS differ? Does the FAT store
both links and which sectors are being used? Or is it like the Commodore
format? Commodore has a DOS command called "Validate" or "Collect" that
will restore the BAM (again MS-DOS' FAT) to what the directory contains.
If MS-DOS also stores the links within each sector, it sounds like it
is very possible to do the same thing in MS-DOS. On the other hand, if
the links are in the FAT and it's zeroed, it would be lots of fun to find
each sector by sector. Hopefully the interleave would help in finding
the correct sector.

Has any quantitative study been done on the merits/drawbacks of leaving
a system run 24 hours a day versus turning it on at 8am and off at 5pm.
Assuming theat there is no machine access during the non-business hours,
the system is still running and hard disk is spinning.
Lacking scientific information, what is your personal choice in the above
matter.
