But the big question is... Did they use WINDOWS in operation desert STORM?

Sorry... couldn't resist.

  I didn't make it to Comdex this Spring, but a report in CSN says that sales
of Windows-based software were up 157% in 1990.  The same report says that
nearly 400 million copies of Windows have been sold.  Are some users running
several copies on the same machine?
  Know what you mean by ShelfWare, though.  My own copy was last used on
4/8/91, and then only to edit a .PCX file with Paintbrush.  It got close
to getting bumped when I loaded Paradox on earlier this month.  I guess
I have gotten used to character-based programs.  Also, I have found that if
you can do something both inside and outside Windows, you can do it faster
outside.  I use DesqView now and then, but mostly for task-switching during
a debugging session, or for doing compiles with the big Fax TSR loaded.

Charlie,
  Can you check with your IBM friend regarding my ancient relics...

]I was curious if you have a file concerning the history of this board
considering that it is the first BBS and had revolutionized modeming.
I am curious because I am starting a business in which I will network
BBS sysops with Businesses to place advertisements on thier systems
(essentially a computer advertising agency).  I would also like to
include your names as the "originators" of the BBS in my literature.
Considering how popular systems such as these have grown, I would assume
that a history of your system does exhist (such as how you developed
the idea, when you started, etc. etc.).
If you can please drop me a note concerning this, or feel free to
call me at 1-708-964-3722.
Sincerly,
Christopher S. Susi.
