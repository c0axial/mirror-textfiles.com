to BILL FISCHER re: R/CHINET DOWN?

  About once a week, Randy has a system board memory parity error with
Chinet - which is running on a 20mhz 386.
  Randy decided - "for speed freaks like you, Ward" (grin) to move his own
386/33 to Chinet, as he crashed Thurs nite.
  Well, turns out his 4th drive just won't be recognized by Unix, though
DOS loves it.  SO chinet was down for the transfer, testing, and eventual
restoration of it on the 20mhz system.

to ALL re: INTNL. SHAREWARE SOURCES

I'm writing an assigned cover-story article on "Shareware around the
World" for which I'll be soliciting viewpoints from individuals in
roughly 20 countries outside the U.S. on five continents. I'm looking
for leads to sources to expand my current list. Individuals needn't be
"experts" on shareware or have any particular qualifications other than
some connection to shareware. Sources may be everyday shareware end
users, dealers, BBS sysops, etc. The only real prerequisites are a
reasonable command of the English language and availability by voice,
modem or (preferably) FAX during July and August. I would welcome leads
to possible sources. Thanks.

Hi Murray! How does the getter continue to operate when the tube is off? Oh
you must mean when the cathode current is off. Where does the getter really
sit? And from what voltage does it operate from? Here is a crude drawing of a
CRT. Can you elaborate?

        --------\
        |        \
        |         \
        |          --------------------------|

        |                         |  |  |  < |
        |                         |  |  |  < |
        |          --------------------------|
        |   +20KV /               |  |  |  |
        |        /
        --------/                 F  B  S  C

  F=Focus;  B=Brightness;  C=Cathode w/heaters times 3

Also from what I can gather, the shadow mask is the same surface as what the
high voltage is also applied to. And ground is applied to the coating just
outside the CRT, which makes a really big capacitor at high voltage. In this
case, it's 20KV, do I have this right so far? Now the barium isn't really in
the electron beam path per se, but must be a lower energy cloud of electrons
which focus' to the high voltage, correct? It would also make sense to fire up
a CRT from time to time to prevent the CRT from losing too much vacuum and
burn up the filaments. Also does the getter operate without filament voltage?
If so, then one would benefit by disconnecting the filaments first for a few
hours to 24 hours, if they believed the vacuum is bad. Is this so?

to CLIFF SHARP re: GETTER THEORY

Well Cliff, your sort of close about how a getter works but I believe your a
little side tracked. The idea isn't to coat the inside of the CRT to prevent
further leakage in, but rather to trap gases and stick them to the sides to
get them out of the way of the electron beam and to prevent oxygen (another
gas) from burning up the filaments. I suppose some coating of porous areas
(though glass isn't very porous) would take place, but not likely to be a big
benefit. Let's say if an air molecule happen to make it through the glass. I
doubt if a small amount of barium will continue to stop it. How our ion getter
pumps would work in our electron microscopes (a large CRT really) which it
appears CRT getters don't have was large magnetics (although the yoke might
work as one) to cause electrons (and I suppose atoms) to take a spiral path
instead of a straight one. Which would cover more area than a straight path.
Like getting two birds with one stone, so to speak. We also used titanium
instead of barium. Why I don't know? Maybe Murray has the answer! My guess
would be because titanium works better, but also cost a lot more. We are
talking about $150 for a CRT and $500,000 for an electron microscope. You can
add a few extras for that price. Our ion pumps claimed to have a life of
20,000 hours. Which was about 2 years at 24 hours per day. Though it seems to
me, they would work closer to 5 years (at 24 hours per day) as a general rule
(though some are still going after 10+ years). The poorer the vacuum, the
shorter they usually lasted. The shortest one would last about 2 years. Our
getters would operate with about 3KV and no heater. I don't think getters ever
used heaters, but Murray should know for sure. I understand that a getter was
invented only after they found out when they used a gauge for high vacuum
which was called a penning tube (or penning gauge), would actually start to
pump on small loads. Someone got the idea to make larger ones and then formed
what we now call a getter. Hey Murray! If the getter supply is isolated, one
could measure the vacuum in the CRT! I suppose measuring the current for the
high voltage while the tube is off would do it. Too bad we have no way to know
what current equals for what vacuum though!

to MURRAY ARNOW re: REFERENCE BOOK

Hi Murray! I know you may not be interested in electronics per se, but here's
a great reference book called "Horowitz and Hill: The Art of Electronics." It
takes a reader with no experience in electronics to a reasonable degree of
proficiency in electronic circuit design (really an expert by typical
researchers in the physical sciences). It is somewhat old (1980), but saved my
neck a number of times. It is published by Cambridge University Press and I
got my copy about 6 or 7 years ago at Kroch's & Brentano's for $29.95. Of
course, they had to special order it. By the way, the ISBN is 0-521-23151-5.
It doesn't have anything on tubes, just solid state devices. It does have a
lot on computers and even something on the RS-232 protocol.
No dup. chars.
