  Sorry, it was down - unattended.  I just got back myself, don't yet know
what was wrong @ Randy's with it.  Again, sorry.

Msg 45159 is 06 line(s) on 09/29/91 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ANDREW DECKOWITZ re: R/CNE?

  The company paid my bill directly, but I think it was in the $5K range,
and $490 for the tests is exactly right.
  There are ads that require CNE, etc, I think it is valuable to have.
Maybe you can work to change company policy on the reimbursement deal due
to the Pass/Fail technique used by Novell.  A place to start would be
Novell themselves, or perhaps LAN\Mind.

I ran into a simular problem trying to add a 1144A into a AT type machine
with an existing 80 MG MFM drive. I found a company called California
Computers that makes a controller that will allow an IDE drive to
co-exist with existing drives. It has it's on on board bios so it can
be loaded several different ways depending on your configuration. I
bought it direct, I'll try and find their phone number for you.
No dup. chars.
