Msg 45012 is 16 line(s) on 07/22/91 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to BILL WOLFF re: R/MATCH DIR'S?

  Well, I wrote a CORR program that correlates two alphabetical lists
of anything, and I have a batch files COR, that does:
  dir %1 | sort >corr.a
  dir %2 | sort >corr.b
  corr corr.a corr.b 32 > corr.out
  <my editor> corr.out
but the trouble is that only works for one directory.
  Actually, I found that PCOPY - the very program that copies files, will
also delete!  Unfortuately it was called "sync", not "delete", so I didn't
find it scanning by keywords.
  When I tried it - in "/t = test" mode (so nothing would actually happen -
a GREAT feature for a program to have) I realized that I was using a
STACKER based disk on one system, and a Double Disk based on on another -
so it would have (yikes!) erased the umpty-megabyte file.
  I found Pcopy has a way to write a batch files - so perhaps I could
take your advice of creating a file - output of PCOPY.

The IIP is going for about $800 - $850 *new*. Elek Tek still has them.
Expect to pay only 60 - 70% of that for a *very* good used one.
No dup. chars.
