to GARY ELFRING re: R/DJ SCALABLE FONTS

  No, not Intellifont - just "plain" HP scaleable fonts as delivered with
the DJ500C.  I guess it was surprisingly simple - I just disabled ATM,
and "poof" only the HP fonts showed up, so somehow, nicely, the two
techniques co-exist to the extent that ATM lets the HP fonts run when
it is disabled.  Somehow i thought it would be less magic and more trouble!

  If you are planning to recode CBBS, the current assembler will probably
translate better to C than to any other language, and there are plenty of
async packages for C.
  If I were doing it I'd probably use Turbo Pascal, but mainly because I
don't like languages that grew out of assembler.  Again with TP there are
several async packages, but I'd use the new object package from TurboPower
Software in Colorado Springs.  These guys seem to be the best so far at
writing generally usable objects.  Come to think of it, they also have a
version for Borland C++ 2.0.

  There have been several messages about scalable fonts, but they all
seem to involve HP printers.  Recently I worked with an Epson with that
capability, and it was their LQ570, which sells for around $260.  It has
Roman and sans-serif fonts that can be scaled from 8 to 32 points. Not all
sizes in that range are available; it will do only 8, 10, 10.5, 12, 14,
16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 26, 26, 28, 30 and 32.  Of course, since the printhead
is only so deep, the big fonts are done in several passes, but all you
have to do is specify the size and send the characters.  It's reasonably
fast, reasonably quiet, and takes the same ribbon as my old RX-80.
