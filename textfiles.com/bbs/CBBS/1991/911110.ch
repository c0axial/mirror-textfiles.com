to AL HIGGINS re: R/ORGANIZING HARD DISK

 I'd be more inclined to have two DRIVES - that may be how I expand
and speed up my high-end system at home - currently it has an old 170M
Priam 519, which I've RLL'ed to 230M, but it is kind of slow. I see
no point in mirroring - after all you get more disk space to have more
disk space. I'm coming from 120M (quite full) to 160M, and was just
wondering.
 My main problem is I just LOVE TREEVIEW, but treeview was written in
the DOS 3.3 days, and uses a small-model C allowing only 2515 directory
entries per screen (23 bytes each or what ever, divided into 64K seg).
 Sorry to hear you loost your 1144! Always bugs me to hear that someone
running the same thing I do loost the drive!
 > I remember back in '77 when we had 10M drives.
 Seriously? I had 8M in perhaps 79 or 80 or 81. 10 was unheard of for
hobbyists until the XT in 84 or so as I recall.??.??
 Sorry for ribbing you - loose is "to not be tight", lose it to "not have".

Yup, there are some very strange static stories. I once did a
consulting job for a company that wanted to make sure that when they changed
from fluorocarbon to organic charged sprays that the cans wouldn't explode
during manufacture or use. Researching for the job it became clear that you
can get a static discharge from almost anything, believe it or not, steam can
be a source of static electricity. One time when I was in LA and the Santa
Anna winds were blowing, I was outside walking and touched a light pole.
I got a terrific static discharge. I blamed it on the fact that the humidity
was near zero, and I was wearing rubber crepe soled shoes.

I just replaced a Western Digital 120 Meg IDE drive (Caviar 2120) with a
WD 200 Meg IDE drive (Piranha 4200). I immediately noticed that the new drive
was louder when the heads were "seeking" than the old drive. Since its
hard to quantify sound, I guess it sounds about twice as loud as the old
drives "seeking" sound. Since my experience is limited with these drives,
can anyone tell me if what I am hearing is normal. (This is definitely not
a bearing noise.)

Sure there are lots of software available for the C128. For one, you have
lots of CP/M software available to run on it. Plus you can run any C64
software program as well. Then there is GEOS (graphic operating system)
which works very much like a MAC. But the best software are those that runs
in C128's 80 column mode. Desterm v2.0 for communications, The Write Stuff
v2.0 for word processing, SwiftCalc 128 for spreadsheets, and dBASE for
database work. Any questions?

to MURRAY ARNOW re: R/HARD DISK NOISE

Contrary to most situations, I've more or less come to ignore all but
the most outrageous of HD sounds, though of course a significant CHANGE
in sound can be another matter. At the moment, I have a couple of HDs in
a machine that mostly functions as a fax computer. It is left on at all
times and occasionally makes a positively screaming sound which disappears
in short order. It's loud enough to hear almost anywhere on the premises
yet hasn't given a hint of trouble since the drives were installed years
ago....In any case, comparing the sound of a specific HD against another
brand shouldn't lead to any concern just because they are different. I
might offer one other experience. I have Seagate 225s in two different
computers, one of which is discernably noisier than the other, yet both
have functioned flawlessly for years. And each is MANY times louder than a
different HD I have in another machine--which I am entirely unable to
hear.

to ALL re: HOW TO COMBINE SYNCS (H&V)

  I need help or documentation on combining the horizontal and vertical
sync signals found on ega/ vga cards into a single signal that can
be fed into a monitor that only takes R-G-B and SYNC, which is a
combined signal.  IT will also allow for one sync to come in with the
green, but again I do not know of a way to mix these two signals.  So
far I have tried combining horizontal and vertical syncs using a
small capacitor to provide isolation but that did not work.
I have left other details in a prior message # 45225.
   ANy ideas ??????
