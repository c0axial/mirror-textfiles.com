  Yep, Lantastic can use IRQs above 7.  Nope, my PC can't.  Only XTs.
I DO have a 286 in it (even a lowly communications 'box' needs more than
a 4.77mhz 8088!)

to TONY ANTONUCCI re: R/LANTASTIC

  My tech ref says that IRQ5 is for the hard disk.  Since this is a PC,
and not an AT, I think that means I can't use it.  I recall that the
AT uses a looping I/O instruction instead of interrupts "or something"
and thus frees up IRQ5, right?
  Re: Network Eye:  Simply a fantastic program!  I really enjoy "toying"
with it.  (I have no legit use for any of this - just a hobby).
  Re: Lantastic Z: Ya, seems to work fine in serial, and even parallel,
when I changed the IRQ to make it work (then changed it back when commo
wouldn't work - sure wish I could figure out who is using IRQ2 that prevents
it commo from working with irq2 selected in Lantastic's Ethernet board!
  P.S. network eye is NOT as good as many of the remote operations packages-
because it doesn't support graphics.  But like Lantastic, it is very frugal
on memory usage.
  Problem with the Xircom is that you have to go with the AI version
of Lantastic (Adapter Independent).  This is $99 per node, rather than
software being bundled with the ethernet card.

to DONALD CROSS re: R/PRODIGY FOLLIES

A TSR would be a nice way to monitor what Prodigy is up to. Although the short
fall of that idea is that the Prodigy software goes out of it's way to
conflict with TSRs. I have tried to use TSRs with Prodigy and they either
won't work or work only half the time. The Prodigy manual tells you to
remove all TSRs before running Prodigy anyway.

There was one report that I had heard was that when you sign the agreement
to use Prodigy, you also agree that it is okay that Prodigy now has access to
to your whole computer system or something close to that effect. I could
dig up the information if someone wants it. I tried to find a statement
like that in my kit, but I couldn't. Maybe I mailed the agreement to
Prodigy or something when I signed up. <BW>

to ALL re: MULTITASKING OR TIME SHARING

It appears what some are calling multitasking is really
nothing more than time sharing? If so, then what would
really qualify as multitasking? One guy told me that
support chips don't count. What?!?! Is multitasking
limited to only what the whole computer system can do, or
only what the microprocessor can do? Also what does the
Amiga people mean by their computer are the only ones
that can truly multitask? Although since the 486 has come
out, I don't think that is true anymore. Or is it? <BW>


Msg 44825 is 05 line(s) on 06/04/91 from MICHAEL SHARTIAG
to ALL re: FAT TABLES /REBUILDING

Is there a utility out there that will re-build your FAT tables by
scanning the disk for files and links?  I have lost both copies of the
FAT on a given drive, but all of the names dates, sizes, etc. still
appear when I do a directory.  Attempting to copy a file in most cases
generates a read error, or a sector not found error.

Msg 44826 is 11 line(s) on 06/04/91 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to BILL WOLFF re: R/MULTITASKING OR TIME SHARING

Multitasking simply means that a single computer system is working
on more than one task at the same time.  Timesharing is one type of
multitasking where the system is working on several different users'
tasks at the same time.  It's possible for a single program to be
performing multiple sub-tasks on a multitasking basis; this is often
called "multi-threaded execution."
What the Amiga people mean was that it was the first personal computer
with an operating system that supported multitasking without requiring
extra-cost third party utilities.  Any processor is theoretically
capable of supporting multitasking, though some make it more practical
than others.

The COPH-2 BBS will be moving from 312-286-0608 to 312-436-0559 in the
next day or so.  The old number will be forwarded to the new one for
a few weeks.

Msg 44828 is 04 line(s) on 06/05/91 from BILL WOLFF
to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/FAT TABLES /REBUILDING

Hi Michael! Let's see... DOS' CHKDSK rebuilds a directory from the FAT
table and RECOVER I believe rebuids a FAT from the directory. Do I have
this correct guys? In either case, you won't like the new file names
that were created. <BW>

Msg 44829 is 04 line(s) on 06/05/91 from BILL WOLFF
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/MULTITASKING OR TIME SHARING

Hi Eric! Well that really sounds great, but I thought most CPUs only
perform one task at a time? Does support chips also count. For example
a 286 with a coprocessor would have two CPUs running at the same time.
<BW>

to WARD re: XIRCOM

Yes, it was a shame that Artisoft went with the "Adapter Dependant" version
of the software. They did that so the get some cash if you but thier ethernet
card OR the per/node software. I got lucky in that I bought all my
LANtastic stuff, before Jan. 1,1991. So I have the AI version. Of course
it will never be upgraded. I hear that Artisoft has just come out with
Version 4.0, I'm pretty eager to get an upgrade...hope it does'nt cost
a bundle! (They upgraded me from 2.57 to 3.00 for free!)
No dup. chars.
