to ALL re: MATCH DIR'S?

  Anyone know of a program that will make two directories match by
ERASING files from one?  I know of programs that copy newer, so the 2nd
dir has the files in the first, but if you've cleaned up the first, it
won't go over and erase files in the 2nd.
  I use (and registered) PCOPY, which works great for the copy-newer,
but not for the deleting.

Free to good home:  Compugraphic 7200i typesetter, the Chicago
Reader's very first typesetter.  Comes with >100 fonts and I
will throw in a small Ektamatic processor.  This machine must
be spoken for in the next few days.  Please call if interested.

For sale:  Quadritek 1201D typesetter and Compugraphic 2400Z
processor.  Comes with several manuals (including service set).
Works pretty well.  Comes with lots of RC paper.  $100 or
make me an offer.

For sale:  Itek 530 Graphic Camera.  Comes with some film and
lots of assorted stuff.  I haven't seen it run, but then, I've never
plugged it in.  Art Institute, whom I bought it from, claim that
it worked the last time they ran it (last year).  May need some
minor work.  $1000 (this is a steal; they are going for $4000
elsewhere).

 Anyone need a GEnie user's manual before I throw it in the garbage?? Please
respond before Labor Day oor it's gone! I used to subscribe to GEnie
and Compuserve and after gathering huge bills, dumped them.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/MATCH DIR'S?

Well I should revise what I said earlier. If you missed it, well sorry
but I deleted it. As it was poorly written. Okay, PC Write (a shareware
word processor) has a nifty feature which compares directories and adds
+'s or -'s to an ASCII list for added or missing files. This sure would
be a good data file to delete those extra files.

Another idea; what about a program which would set each file to read only
if it also finds one on the other disk. That way one could just delete
all files not set for read only. Someway the archive bit may also be
used, but briefly I fail to see how.

How many files and how big of a job is this task you want to do? The bigger
the job, the larger this program can be.
