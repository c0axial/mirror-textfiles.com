to BILL WOLFF re: R/FAT TABLES /REBUILDING

  The MS-DOS system is based upon a cluster size - may be as little as
512 bytes, but is typically 2K or 4K for hard disks - 4K if the disk
is below 16M (because it uses 12-bit cluster pointers in the FAT), or
2K over 16M (because it uses 16-bit cluster pointers in the FAT).
  The FAT is a table right after the boot sector, which, per above,
contains either 12-bit or 16-bit pointers to the CLUSTER.
  The active sectors are determined by the length field within the
directory.  If a file is 1050 bytes long, that sez it occupies 2.x
sectors, but all in one cluster.
  The valid FAT pointers are: "nn" to point to the next cluster,
F7FF to indicate a bad cluster (don't allocate to it), 0000 for an
open cluster (can allocate a file there), or FFFF for the end of a
chain.
  When you erase a file, the first byte of the filename gets changed to
an E5 in the directory, but everything else stays intact - i.e. the
cluster pointer, and file length.
  However, the FAT is ZEROED for all clusters that that file occupied,
making it very difficult to piece the file together if it is more than
one cluster long.  (you have the first cluster from the erased directory
entry, but you have to guess at the rest).  Some people "compress" their
disks so that clusters will be contiguous in case they need to un-erase.

  I'd LOVE to become aware of some location that is installing 100+
PCs, and arbitrarily (flip of the coin, or odd/even letters in first+last
name, etc) to determine who leaves the machine on, and who turns 'em off.
  My thoughts:
  - electronics age faster from power on/off cycles;
  - drives have a finite # of power on/off cycles, as well as a finite
# of power-on hours.  Some say that the grease in the bearings tends
to work its way out from power-on/off cycles, while it doesn't happen as
fast if the drive is left on.
  - At work the Air Condx turns off at 6:00, and it is known to get up to
95 degrees on the weekend.  I INSIST on all machines being powered off,
both to not ADD to the heat for the few that are in working, but also
to prevent premature failures due to the excessive temperature.
  I also am concerned about "energy wasting" - by leaving machines on,
SO I power off all my machines overnight.  I USED to leave my PC on
Friday nights, knowing I'd be using it Sat AM, but now I turn it off
all the time.  Leave it on if you're going to use it again the same
day, otherwise shut it off - that'd be my advice - saves our energy
resources.  Then again someone could do a rebuttal "but think of all
the energy you'd waste making new components if they fail prematurely!".

   As Ward said, you have one heckuva hacking job ahead if you choose
to go ahead with this.  But you mentioned changing controllers; I have
personally never ever been able to read a disk after changing to a
different controller, except when I went from a WD1002 to a WD1003.
   I have a dumpy little program (in progress) that at present will read
whatever it finds in the position the partition table should be in, and
compare that data to the CMOS settings, etc. and display what the part
table says the drive is set up for.  If you'd like a copy to verify that
the machine is indeed reading your disk right, leave a message and we'll
work out details of transfer.
   I would say the best possibility of recovery and the easiest, would
be to get another WD1003 and use it to back up the drive, then install
the new controller, LL format, FDISK and HL format, and reinstall all
the stuff.  Might be safest, too.  I have a controller you can borrow
if you like (converted to IDE here).

Looks like you've already received most of the nitty-gritty (and ugly!)
details. I might add, though, that if some of the data are REALLY
valuable you could consider some of the commercial services which
specialize in exactly this sort of thing. Since they've put together the
tools, it might expedite things and (if you're charging for your work on
resurrecting files) might be more economical from the client's perspective.
   Though it's not a help for you now, the recent msg exchanges have
suggested a spin-off of an unreleased program which saves (and encrypts)
all FAT, boot-sector, root DIR and (possible) reserved sectors to a
floppy, then *intentionally* "corrupts" the HD as a disk lock-out method.
The spin-off idea would be simply to save an UNencrypted image of those
areas. Running this regularly (maybe as part of AUTOEXEC.BAT) on a client's
machine might be a good idea for consultants--so you'd have at least a
reasonably current copy of FATs, etc., if a crisis like the one you've
described hits. (Make that WHEN it hits!)

Yep, some studies have been done, but none to my knowledge under a rigid
set of conditions. Ward has outlined some of the factors which certainly
are worth considering....From what I've come across, the jury seems to
still be out on the question. My own rule of thumb is to turn off any
inactive machines if I'm leaving the premises for an extended period of
time. On the other hand, one machine stays fully on at all times, a second
stays on EXCEPT for the monitor at all times....As a very Unscientific
observation, I have two largely identical machines of the same (old!)
vintage, one of which is the "always" on machine, the other is generally
on very briefly, then turned off for the day. I've been able to discern
absolutely no difference in long-term wear and tear between them.

to KEVIN CLARK re: R/LOOKING FOR DEC SOFTWARE

Hi Kevin! I sort of answered your question already on "The Round Table"
but I briefly add some here. I never even seen a real Rainbow computer.
I was just in a used computer store in Silicon Valley (the best place
to get old computer stuff cheap and by the truck load) and they had
some Rainbow software unopened for a few dollars each. I knew that it
would be risky, but I decided this maybe a chance in a lifetime to get
cheap software for either CP/M or MS-DOS operating systems. It turns
out that it doesn't work on either, but just on Rainbow computers. I
was going to hack at it, but once I learned what was going to be involved,
I decided that my time was worth more then the benefits. So I gave it
all away.

What about you? Well I believe there must be a Rainbow Users group out
there somewhere. If Timex computers still has a users group, hey, why
not? Now all you have to do is find it. Leaving messages on BBS networks
is a good start. Keep it up and I hope you well.

Msg 44874 is 30 line(s) on 06/20/91 from BILL WOLFF
to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/ALWAYS ON VS POWER UP/DOWN

I pretty much agree with what everyone else has said. Though I do have
lots of experience with electronics in general. We know that turning
on and off is bad for electronics. Those spikes causes junctions to go
and electrolitic capacitors to short (or open after time). We also know
that electrons are really eating away small parts of the curcuits every
second. Though design also plays a big part. When I worked in R&D, we
could tell you when a certain transistor would fail within a few hours,
if we knew the temperature and how long it was on. You could build
curcuits to withstand the spikes of turning off and on for much longer
periods of time and higher temperatures. This is in fact what R&D people
try to do. If the people who designed your computer was looking for
making it cheaper than there were shortcuts taken very likely.

I have seen the same models of equipment act differently. Some can take
being turned on and off (for service repair I had to do this) without
problems or I seen some blow something almost very time till you replace
all the weak links and then everything was fine again. I still have lots
of very old electronics and I am very surprised that most of it still
works.

A light bulb is a good example of some electronics. It will very likely
go bad during the turn on proceedure (spikes). It will fail though too,
if you leave it on enough. I do want to add this theory of mine though.
Things like laptops which is low power and almost no heat may not make
a bit of difference whether they are on or off. Some electronics you
see also goes bad from time (age) alone. Ward can also feel better if
someone leaves a small laptop on for energy savings. Since the cost is
very low to begin with. For example, mine draws 23 watts max and won't
likely place a dent in energy savings. The dumb meter outside your
house draws 3 watts I believe of it's own power.

Boy that was sure valuable information. Does CP/M also use CLUSTERS
as well? Does it follow the same type of format? I know on my
different CP/M computers some logs in either 1K, 2K or even 4K
segments. Though the sector sizes don't follow this pattern I don't
believe. Would this then be the CLUSTERS?

Since I use 720K floppies on my MS-DOS. Is this say 512K CLUSTER size?

  Won't make a mail pickup and send-out quickly.
  One thing for sure about S/W is:
  Make sure all international stuff is STATED like only payment
in US funds DRAWN on a US bank! I have noticed that most want
more info on what I have so including something about other pgms
IS important in the docs.
  Only received ONE S/W fee, the rest were orders for the registered
version which had a printout option and only screen output was
on the S/W version.
  The right distributors is also important. Distributors tricke
(trickle) in after a while and they want to handle it. I only
advertised for 2 issues in Computer shopper long ago and have
had others do the distributing. Received a request from Australia
the other week from a guy who got hold of the FIRST dinky version
I had out (heck 2- 2 1/2 years ago) and wanted to know about V2 where it
is V3.2 now (should be V4 by now).
  Also state the price for a specific version like 3.X and other
upgrades are more. People get these things years later and expect
the price to be the same and it must if it is in writing.

After some digging, the XP12E somwhow becomes a Xerox 2700 laser printer.
This was supposedly a supported printer under WIndows 2.0 & 2.1
There are also alledgedly Wordperfect compatible fonts on disk for this
printer.  The 4050 desktop unit has an emulation mode that makes it a 2700
printer.
Now for the revised questions:  Does anyone have or know where I can get
these fonts or any other fonts for the 2700? Does anyone have access to
the documentation for the 2700?

CP/M stores all of its allocation information in the directory entries
themselves.  Each entry contains an array of 16 cluster numbers.  If
a file uses more than 16 clusters, it gets a second directory entry
(I can't remember if theres's a "second entry" flag or if this is just
determined by position.  The number of sectors per cluster is determined
at system generation time.

DELL computers in general and specifically the 325P.
A friend of mine is considering purchasing one and would be interested
in any information, both pros and cons, relating to this line of
equipment.
Thanks in advance,
James Schmidt

I just heard that the free upgrade to LANtastic 4.0 WILL be for those
who purchased it after May 1st.....lucky you. I bought mine in April,
but I will be getting another AE2 card in the near future, so I will
get it with that.....ooooppps I would not get the server software. I'll
have to call'em.

Eric provided most of the info re CP/M DIR entries. An additional comment
or two....The size of a particular cluster is stored in a system parameter
block (that's my term--it was something similar) along with a quite a bit
of additional (cryptic!) info. The data in the parm block was machine-
specific, thus having a lot to do with a major flaw in CP/M--lack of a
standard for disk formats....The 32-byte DIR entry contained one byte which
revealed whether it was self-contained or "chained" to a later entry (which
may or may not be the next entry....As for your DOS 720K floppies, they
generally contain 1K clusters (512 bytes per sector, 2 sectors per cluster).
Data to calculate these and other values are stored in a reserved system
area on the disk; it IS legal to use an alternate scheme, as such scheme
can be calculated from the disk parm block.
        Re the Rainbow Lotus disks: Yep, they've already been passed along
and graciously received by a client. Thanks again.

Though your comments weren't too closely connected to the question (and
focus of the article), I appreciate the reply. I've captured your thoughts
--maybe they'll tie into some tangents as the manuscript takes form....The
questionnaire did go out this week. As I'd noted on it, if by chance you
receive it and can get it back by this coming Friday, the 28th (ABSOLUTE
latest), your input still might be usable. I'll be turning to the piece
early in the week but may or may not wind it up till Friday. If not
mailed before then, I'll have to pop for FedEx, so the incentive for an
earlier completion is there. :-}

I have a couple of CP/M floppy & RAM disk only machines
 equipped with screen blankers.  Since these use about 10 watts or so
in standby mode (and since the disk drives have to run for some time to
load up the RAM disks), I tend to leave these on, for as long as six
months at a stretch.  They work fine, and I suspect that, given their age
(which is about 7 years), this has to do with this mode of treatment.

On the other hand, I have a PC at work that I shut down at the end of each
day.  My reasoning is that nothing mechanical (per se) is going on in the
CP/M boxes, so they should be nice and stable.  On the other hand, the PC
is a noisy little sucker with hard disk whining and fan buzzing.  If
something should go MECHANICALLY wrong with these parts, bye-bye machine.

So, as long as the machine is running ONLY electronics, and is in a
reasonable, well-ventilated place, I would tend to leave it on.  If it
has a lot of things that make noise, I would turn it off.  BTW, some of the
newer lap tops DO have a hard disk power-down setting, so that the disk
stops spinning after a few minutes w/o access.  Now, if we could only
get rid of the fershlugginer fans!

On the topic of power conservation -- Ward, how much power does your work
save by shutting down the A/C?  I would think that cooling an overheated
building down to reasonable working temperatures would cost more than
keeping it on for the weekend, but I could well be wrong...
No dup. chars.
