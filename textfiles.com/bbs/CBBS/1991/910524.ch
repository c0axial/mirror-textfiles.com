No problem, just every now and then I get the urge to dump some hardware.
Usually to make room and $ for new stuff. I got the Amiga to do a project
on in grad school, and have never used it for much since. I DID spend millions
of hours working/playing/coding etc on an Apple ][, and have tons of
software. But its pretty safe to assume I would not use the Apple much
either, since almost 100% of my work is on the IBM iron.

would consider new or used. A 386SX is the minimum. Can you provide a few
specifics about what you have available? (If you want to catch me faster
than my occasional calls here, see immediately-preceding msg for contact
info. I'm located in the South Loop area.)

It does seem strange, doesn't it. Maybe many other people are like I am. {_
Although a computer may sit around for ages not being used, there's always
the chance that it MIGHT be used again. In the case of our Apple II+, my
son has periods of heavy use followed by periods of no use. I keep
expecting that he will abandon it altogether, then he goes back to it.

to ALL re: PRODIGY FOLLIES

 Well, after seeing all the brouhaha about Prodigy and STAGE.DAT, I
decided to dig out my brand-new software and install it on my hard disk
as a test. Here's what I did:
 *defragmented the hard drive
 *ran my own utility to set all unused disk space to 0E5H
 *installed the Prodigy software
 *went through STAGE.DAT to see if anything "secret" was there

 Here's what I found. From offset 0 through offset 3DCFF in the file,
there were areas that looked like copies of _parts_ of my FAT; there
were two copies of my environment; and there were multiple areas of
Prodigy-looking stuff, with small (i.e., < 256 bytes) areas of 0E5H
interspersed. So far as I was able to stand looking at all those
screens, everything from offset 3DD00 through E7FFF was 0E5H.

 Here's what I did NOT do; I never ran the Prodigy software. Since I
no longer maintain an account with them, it wouldn't have done any good
anyway.
 Here's what I decided: STAGE.DAT does legitimately make a big file
from unused disk space and then copy some things into parts of it. Any
"secret" stuff that can be found in STAGE.DAT would therefore have been
on the disk (in the parts that Prodigy did NOT yet copy into) before the
installation software touched the disk surface.
 My conclusion is that, although software that takes control of my
computer and calls an on-line computer could very well go careening
through all the data on my drive, there's no evidence that Prodigy is
doing it with the STAGE.DAT file. Your mileage may vary. So there.

Is that system still for sale? (I contacted you a couple weeks ago
about it.) If so, I'm still interested - call me at 312/334-2308
(24 hr answering machine if I don't get to the phone first).

 The National Weather Service has warned us to keep away from Windows
during a Tornado Warning. Is this a reference to the Microsoft
product, or does it apply to GUIs in general?
