to ALL re: BBS WARNING

I found this on the Stillwaters BBS message bases:


 Sysops:
       I come to you with a warning about a troublesome BBS called
Hi-Lights-aka-Remote Access, Not Just Another BBS. The phone number is
708-452-4417. The warning is that when you sign-up, your personal information
is broadcasted to everyone. Not only do they make slanderous remarks
about you but that they call your home up and cuss up a storm to whoever
answers,as in my case,my 7 year old. When one confronts the sysop,Chewbaca,
to delete any and all text involving one's personal info, he then resorts
to the same antics and slams the door in your face. His real last name is
Roraff, residing at 4019 Ozanam in Norridge, Il. Please, I ask of you,
in the name of a good clean hobby...Keep this BBS off any good BBS listing.
Thank you.
Bob Anderson

 Take this warning at face value. Log onto this BBS at your own risk.


Max Kohn

YOu may have already gotten this answer since I see your post is from
February, but there is a Chicago number...1-312-616-1071. Access can be a
little tricky, they seem to need a password.

to MAX KOHN re: R/BBS WARNING

  Norridge is SMALL and a letter to the township or a trip over there
will do wonders. I have been to the city hall and it is nice. I also
know from this location that there are some pure looniy families living
in that area.

Msg 44696 is 03 line(s) on 04/29/91 from RICHARD GOZDAL

  The practices of this BBS is one reason I have hardly been logging
onto new ones. Too many loonies out there and too much info is
given out on registration.

to ALL re: DISK COMPRESS

  I need more HD space and don't want to go over the 120 meg I
have now. Anyone know the best file squeezers? I need one
to compress data and overlays etc also. Some program files
are megs and megs and I would like to segregate pgms and only
compress some (some might be slowed too much).

Msg 44698 is 23 line(s) on 04/30/91 from DANA BLANKENHORN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: BOOK

Dear Ward:

         Thanks so much for your note.
         I can respect your desire not to be interviewed, but I'd
like to change your mind in the only way I know how. That is, by
following your instructions.
         My plan is to download the CBBS file you recommend on
Chinet, and to talk to Randy Seuss. I will also talk, next week,
to Dennis Hayes, who I understand worked closely with you on CBBS
in 1978, and get his story.
         Only after that will I consider troubling you again, and
then only with a list of specific questions, posted here. I hope
to follow that up with a phone call. I'd encourage you at that
time to talk with Randy Seuss concerning my interview technique
and whether I'm worth talking to.
         I'm sorry you had a bad experience with "Boardwatch" and
I don't want to add to it in any way. But I'm responsible for an
accurate portrayal of BBS history in my own book and hope I can
honor you with that, if nothing else.
         I still hope to talk with you, at your convenience,
after I've done more homework. Until then, please accept my
thanks for your time, and for starting such a great industry.
         Sincerely, Dana Blankenhorn (ph. 404-373-7634)

Can anyone tell me where I would be able to purchase an HP deskjet
printer? (new)  I have a friend who's looking for one.
(p.s. What's the diff. between DJ, DJ 500, and DJ+?)


Msg 44702 is 04 line(s) on 05/02/91 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to PETE CANTELE re: R/HELP W/DESKJET PURCHASE

The best price can be found at Elek-Tek ($330 for the plain Deskjet).
 The "/ higher" models have more built-in fonts, landscape printing and
are somewhat faster (3 ppm rather than 2; the difference comes from
grabbing the pages faster, not from increased CPS).

The biggest diff will be faster graphics printing, and landscape, in
the + and 500 over the plain DJ, also the 500 has a nice times font
built in (but only one size - a good "correspondence" size).

Any thoughts on the following project: a 64-user BBS, implemented as
4, 16M 486s running 16 copies of RBBS/PC under DesqView-386, Token Ring
LAN with Netware 3.11.
  A 5th system will be the server - probably a Compaq SystemPro.

to WARD re: 64-USER BBS

Ward; It would seem to me that running 16 copies of the BBS on one machine
(even a 486) would be quite a feat for the machine. The disk I/O gets to be
a bottleneck. I run a 4 node BBS (one node local only) and with 3 people on
and me poking around, the network can slow down. I run 10mbps ethernet and
the server is a 33mhz-386 with a fast SCSI (15ms) hard disk. The SystemPro
would be faster, but your asking it to do 16 times as much. Gene Plantz runs
13 nodes on his BBS, and with over 10 people on, I get slower downloads, due
mostly to disk I/O I would guess. He runs Netware 386.

Ward; how about one of the Unix based BBS systems ? After all, they are
designed for multi-user access. Also, I think you would need far less
horsepower.

to ALL re: BIX OR COMPUSERVE

Which system is BETTER, BIX or Compuserve. My purpose is
general questions on the IBM AT clones, some PD software
etc. I can't seem to find an access number BIX, either
800 or otherwise. Anybody got info?
Thanks
