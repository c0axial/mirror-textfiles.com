Msg 45172 is 10 line(s) on 10/16/91 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: COLOR DESKJET!

  Just saw on BIX that the Color Deskjet is out - 500C.  Apparen
takes one cartridge - black - OR - CMY - and it simulates black (muddy
brown) by zapping all 3 colors on top of each other.
  Anyone seen one yet?  I'd like to upgrade, but most of what I do would
be B/W, and I think manually swapping cartridges is asking for problems-
I seem to "lose" cartridges that are out of the machine for any length
of time.  Right now I try to "condition" them by soaking the "nose" in
distilled water, perhaps with a bit of 409 or other solvent.  Also store
the un-used ones in a margarine dish, off the bottom (a bottle cap in
the bottom) with water in the bottom - to keep 'em from drying out.
No dup. chars.
