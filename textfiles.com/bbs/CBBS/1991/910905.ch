  I wouldn't "chance" a 5.0 based install - 1.3 is designed for dual-boot
on a DOS 4.0 base - you have 3 possible outcomes:
  1. it might just screw up
  2. it might work
  3. it might say it can't work
(all above dealing with DOS 5).

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/OS/2 INSTALL

Thanks for thoughts. I'm considering getting another hard disk, and
installing 1.3 on it with the HPFS...hoping to preserve drive C:
from any untoward damage. I have an Ada compiler which uses a DOS
extender that I very much would like to see run successfully under
OS/2. I have seen more than one statement in BYTE to the effect that
OS/2 won't work with certain (un-named) extenders (and/or memory
managers???), and I want to test my compiler/linker. I think it's
Phar Lap based, but i'm not sure. I wonder how QEMM 5.1 fits into
all this (if at all). Regards...

Msg 45107 is 16 line(s) on 09/04/91 from BILL MATTSON
to WARD re: OS/2 INSTALL

Just received the new owner's support letter from IBM, with the
support number to call...free support for 90 days, but it doesn't
start for another 4-5 days from now. I'll be asking them a few
questions about OS/2 install but don't expect too much sympathy
for someone working in a non-PS2 environment. My current fantasy
install scenario is to install 1.3 with FAT's and dualboot with
DOS 5.0 just to see what happens (backed up, of course). If no
success, then back to Compaq DOS 3.31 (large partitions) and OS2.
Then will try to install second hard disk and set up as HPFS disk.
I don't think this will work, as I suspect OS/2 will want to be
all FAT or all HPFS. THAT'S the interesting question in my mind.
I have to admit that DOS 5.0 with QEMM 5.11 is nice. The memory
management stuff MS supplies with 5.0 didn't seem to want to work,
so I just went back to QEMM and voila'... it's soup! Incidently,
I ordered OS/2 by toll free phone. and VISA, and had it in a few
days by UPS for a mere 99-small...as advertised.
No dup. chars.
