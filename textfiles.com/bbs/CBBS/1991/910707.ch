  Are you on Compuserve?  There is a forum called "IBMEUR" (Europe)
which could give you a good start!

There's a second edition of Horowitz and Hill, dated 1989.  Among other
things, they completely rewrote the chapter on FETs.  Definitely worth
the money.

I'll quickly answer your questions. If you want more detail look at the
Handbook of Materials and Techniques for Vacuum Devices by Walter Kohl
(Reinhold, 1967) andColor Television Picture Tubes by Albert Morrell, et. al.,
(Academic Press,1974). I beleive both books are out of print, but your library
may have copies. This is a very mature industry and new books aren't in demand.
Now, the getter is always functioning until it gets exhausted, which may or may
not happen during the life of a tube. The better the tube is processed the
less outgassing and getters last forever.  The tube needs not to be operating
for barium getters to function.  A barium getter operates this way.  A device
holding a barium suspension in an aluminum matrix is welded to the gun.  The
device often called the getter is heated after the tube has been pumped and
sealed.  The barium is vaporized during the heating and is deposited on the
inside of the tube, usually on the envelope and mask.  Barium is an active
metal and combines with the residual gases in the tube to form barium compounds
The barium coating the mask is going to be exposed to electron beam
bombardment. The x-rays usually are created here.  The coating on the funnel
is not at ground it is at the screen voltage.  It is there to form a field
free region so the electron beam isn't defelected by electrostatic forces.
By the way I've been involved in electronics design for about 20 years,
ranging from tubes to chips, voltages from 150KV down to nanovolts.  Thanks,
for your references.  If I get a chance I'll look at it.

Hi Eric! I should have known that you would have one one those reference
books and a 1989 edition at that. You can be sure that I'll be checking out
the newer version. Where did you get yours at?

to MURRAY ARNOW re: R/CRT LIFETIMES

Thanks again Murray! The knowledge you shared sure illustrated a great
deal. I must say there is a big distinction between high vacuum systems and
vacuum tubes. The system I used to work on had to be reopened to air from
time to time. The getter system used in CRT's just couldn't handle this
mistreatment. Yet on the other hand, if we had a getter that always
performed, that sounds really convenient.

If you didn't know, electron microscopes go up to 1 million volts. Many of
the ones I was close to, created 120KV to 400KV. Some used oil as an
insulator and some used SF6 gas. Some of the circuits that I had to check,
required to be within one millionth of a volt. Tightfisted specifications
huh? It had to be, as the error would then would be magnified one million
times. It was tough finding a differential voltmeter. I even had to make my
own to get by. Maybe that is why they only hired engineers.

It was also my job to interface electron microscopes to computers with
imaging packages. Not fun when you were the first one doing them. I've
learned they are still doing them just the way I had designed the first
few. That is good, but there were some things I would have liked to have
done differently if I had the time. Was it that way with you as well? By
the way, thank you for the references. I am very likely to check them out.
No dup. chars.
