to CLIFF SHARP re: R/IDE 'PRIMARY FORMAT'??

  Thanks, no need to format that data - someone on BIX got it for me.
It appears to be a Seagate spec sheet.

Msg 44998 is 02 line(s) on 07/17/91 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to BILL WOLFF re: HELP FULL

  Sorry, somehow it didn't get into HELP - try typing: full?
(yes, that's right, with the ? after it).

Msg 44999 is 09 line(s) on 07/18/91 from DAVID JOHNSON
to ARNOLD BOYD re: CONFIRMATION

Hello Arnold,
    I just wanted to leave a message confirming our voice discussion about the
Texas Instruments Professional computer.  I am looking forward to picking
it up this Saturday.  Most likely I will be there in the early afternoon.
As per your request, I will call before coming.  Again, thanks for the
kind offer of the P.C.  I already told my girlfriend about it, and she was
excited about the acquisition of it as well.

Dave Johnson
