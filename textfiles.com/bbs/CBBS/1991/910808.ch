  Anyone here a Certified Netware Engineer?  I've just started taking my
tests.  I'm rather paranoid about some of the tests.  I'm trying to get
a 2.15 server going at home, using Lantastic's AE2 board, but having
troubles.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: DFT VS. CUT FILE TRANSFERS

Ward,
   A few messages back you described some differences in the way
ind$file handled data depending on whether the workstation was a
DFT or CUT.
I did some research and found the Query Bit in the logmode table was
the key to whether the transfer was DFT or CUT. Now I ask myself
"What other things perform better as DFT ?" and have found a dearth
of information on the subject.
I guess my basic question might be "What makes a DFT workstation
different from a CUT workstation?" Are there any documents that explain
the inner differences of these two schemes?

Ward,
   A fellow here at work has passed 6 out of the necessary 7 test
for the Novell Certified Engineer. He will be taking number 7 shortly.
If you could like to get in contact with him just let me know.

You can bet your very last bippy I absolutely do not want to see any

paper are constantly crammed with baseball, basketball, football,
etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.,...Please.........
I'm begging you...
