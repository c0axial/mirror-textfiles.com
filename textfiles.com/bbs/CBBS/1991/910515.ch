Does anyone have the phone # for the ddsw UNIX system?  Does anyone have the
phone number for the pro-harvest (Apple) system?  Also, if you have phone
numbers for any good (elite) Amiga BBS's, please post them...

Thanks!

actually, I got the number for bix from byte magazine. After typing my a
answer to you, I went back to their board and noodled around. I had forgotten
from the last time I had logged on that a caller could gain an access
channel by typing "bix". When I first logged on, I was given access to
a series of demo programs. On successive log ons, there have been prompts
for a subscription fee. So, it is not that it is private' it's just
a little costly at $39 every three months. Sorry about the confusion, but I am
am fairly new at this and really do understand bbs etiquette, even if my
inexperience might sometimes belie that fact. Again, thanks for your time.

I too would be interested in a cheap legal copy of WS4. Either CP/M or
MS-DOS would be fine. <BW>

Hi Ward! You still have the install disk for Prodigy, don't you? I know I
still have mine. The problem I have is that I don't currently have access
to a hard drive and so reinstalling another copy without a hard disk isn't
going to prove much. Since people are claiming that info from their hard
disk is contained on the file STAGE.DAT, I would suggest turning on the
computer and just installing Prodigy on a floppy disk. If you then find
some info from your hard disk on Prodigy's STAGE.DAT? Then I could think
of nothing else other than the Prodigy software placed it there. You don't
have to call Prodigy or anything. If I had a hard disk, I would have done
it weeks ago. So what do you say? <BW>

  I will pass your msg 44752, along with your stats to the
person I'd mentioned, and it'll be up to THAT person to
contact you.
