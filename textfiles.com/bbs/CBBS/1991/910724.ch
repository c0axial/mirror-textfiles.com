]Greetings guys!

Thought it was about time that I dropped in to see how it was going.
Yes, the long-distance cousin system still lives, in fact they even
wrote about us not too long after they wrote about you!

Ok, it was not much of an article...  Ok, it was not an article...
Alright, I'll admit it...  They just mentioned that we were just about
the only system left running that was on the first published BBS list.
But hey, it was SOMETHING!     B^}

Tried to call Ward's system first, but it does not seem to be there?
Heck, I know how that goes...

Well... all for now I guess.  Best wishes to all!

BTW:  version 4???  whats new now???
