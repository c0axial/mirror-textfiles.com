  Well, the durned thing (T1000XE) came back from Toshiba with NTF -
No Trouble Found.  So what ever it was, it cleared up with time.  Perhaps
they "reset it" by removing power or something.  Interesing thought about
a latch-up of a chip.  And for sure, the thing doesn't power off when
you power off - matter of fact, it draws 6.6ma when "powered off" -
about a week's worth of time!

to ALL re: ORGANIZING HARD DISK

  At work I'm chaging from a 120M to a 160M hard disk.  Any thoughts
on organizing it?  No tape drive for backups, so I'd like not to have
to back it all up very often!
  I'm thinking of trying to separate applications from data on 2
partitions - means a little extra work doing "save as" under Windows
and other applications.
  One thought against that is how often my application set changes -
upgrades, new PD software, stuff I've written, etc.  I can't really
see a partition staying "static" for long!
  Thanks for any ideas!

I recently was faced with a comparable decision. As my apps also are
volatile <G>, I opted for a single partition. Though I generally
wouldn't recommend it to others, I back up DIRs on an as-needed daily
basis by running a program of mine which reflects the current day's
changes in file creation/update. I think a reasonable alternative might
be careful segregation of data into their own DIRs, then do back-ups
something like this with prepared back-up program scripts: (1) daily
back-up of all data DIRs; (2) weekly back-up of app DIRs which contain
some files which update on app "status" (e.g., WINDOWS); and (3) full-
blown "full" back-ups on a monthly basis.

Just some comments on static.  I noticed static becoming an growing problem
as leather was increasingly replaced by synthetics in shoes.  Particularly,
replacing leather soles with crepe and other rubber substitutes that don't
absorb moisture can aggravate the "static problem". A solution, not
practical for work, is to go around barefoot or in stocking feet.  Otherwise,
the easiest solution is to discharge yourself before you turn on a computer.
To reduce the shock sensation, hold a key and touch a grounded object.

to JERRY OLSEN re: R/ORGANIZING HD

  I like that idea - of leaving it one partition, but organizing fixed
vs variable data into diff subdirs!  Also, since I've ALREADY created
a 127M partition, I think that is easiest (no need to full-back-up and
repartition and restore).
  I'm growing very fond of a new shareware program: STOWAWAY.  It is
an archiving program, somewhat similar to Intelligent Backup.  With it
you archive old things (whole dirs, individual files, etc) off to
diskette (with verify, optional erasing of source).  It is helping me
clean up my hard disks, making the backups easier.
  I think I might try to create a single subdir (of course with lots
of subdirs under it) of applications that can be readily re-installed
(such as Norton 6.0), then never back up anything there.
  Thanks for the ideas!
