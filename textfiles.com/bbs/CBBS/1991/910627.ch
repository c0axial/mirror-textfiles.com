]On some calls, when the modem answers, it seems to skip the fist high
pitched stable tone.  When this occurs, I can not make a connection.
If I hang up on the modem, the problem still reamins when I call back.
However, if I wait for your system to drop me and then call back, I
get on, and the system recognizes me at 2400 baud.  AS my modem is
auto switching, it seems that it is not recognizing the raspy tone,
or maybe they need the solid tone first.

  It doesn't seem to be the serial # that DOS 4.01 checks but the
LABEL. I have had many reboots because it asked for the LABEL
of the disk I had in it which differed from the 'present' one.

to DONALD CROSS re: R/PRODIGY FOLLIES

The June 1991 issue of Boardwatch  magazine has a rather
long article about this Prodigy issue.
The article states that Prodigy is NOT hard drive snooping.
Rather that the file STAGE.DAT is being used as a sudo-sub
directory.  Problem is that most of this file/directory
contains NOTHING.  So the disk's FAT shows one large file,
that is almost empty, but since whatever data that WAS on the
disk and erased is still ON the disk  (Only the pointers have
changed.) this data is then included in the STAGE.DAT file.
The BoardWatch article goes into much more detail.  It might
be worth a look-see if anyone is interested.
Board watch is NOT available through any mas market bookstore.
The only place I EVER see it at is the Book Market right across
from Sears at 6-corners here in Chicago.

  The "raspy" tone (I call it "shhhhhhh") is the fact that it has
recognized 1200 or 2400...
  Anyone got any ideas?

Received yours today, thanks....I'll be reviewing it (and submissions of
others) tomorrow. "Thanks" to a local client project which has become
horrendously more complex than anticipated, work on the article has been
pushed back, though it still must be submitted by the first. If I don't
get back to you for in-depth comments, you might want to check out any
of your written responses I may use in the September issue of Shareware
magazine. Thanks again.

What's "great" as a reference for one person is so-so for the next. I've
found the best thing is just to peruse a large collection such as Kroch's
in the Loop. That said, my primary introduction to C was "Turbo C: The
Complete Reference." (Nearly identical versions exist for Quick C, etc.)
My favorite "general" C reference--when the compiler manuals themselves
prove insufficient--s The Waite Group's "Turbo C Bible." Among other
features, I value the cross-reference chart for each function, indicating
whether the same (or comparable) fxn exists in several other C compilers.
Lastly, the book I used as a basis for jumping beyond the basics to more
"sophisticated" techniques (TSRs, etc.) without a doubt is "Systems
Programming in Turbo C" (a somewhat misleading title). Though I've heavily
modified and expanded the techniques therein, the book provided an
exceptionally lucid explanation of tricky problems--with a collection of
well-integrated, comprehensive code to handle most common problem areas.

We have several Dells where I work.  They have been faithful for the most
part.  When one did develop a problem the company was quick to arrange for
repairs.  The only thing I did not like on mine (System 200) was the
keyboard.  It was too soft for me.  I have never had a problem with it.
