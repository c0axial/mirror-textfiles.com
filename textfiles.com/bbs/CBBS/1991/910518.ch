Msg 44775 is 12 line(s) on 05/17/91 from GERALD PINE
to TONY ANTONUCCI re: R/SWAP

The major reason for my interest was that I thought the Amiga might be
a useful route for my son to get into some drawing/CAD types of programs.
I later discovered two things:  1.  Autosketch was highly recommended to us,
and it unfortunately runs only on MSDOS machines.  We got a copy of it.
2.  My son still uses the Apple II+ more than I thought he did.
I guess the bottom line is that }i{_I changed my mind.  I {_presume that
you have looked aro{_und at Apple II+~r ads in some of the ad papers.
They are available commonly for $250 or less.  If you are interested in
purchasing one, I can probably put you in touch with at  least one or
two of my work colleagues who would be glad to dispose of one.  In fact,
I'm surprised that no one else here expressed any interest in at least
selling you one.
