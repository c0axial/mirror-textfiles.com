If you want a free ticket to PC Expo Chicago (Nov 19 - 21) just
send me a stamped (business size) self addressed envelope. Gary

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/CNE?

I have a basic problem with the way support is provided by Novell.
Even if I go through the extremely expensive CNE training, I will still
need to maintain a CI$ account to keep up-to-date.  In our first 2
weeks of connection, our on-line charges are already over $75, and that
is WITH tapcis! (which must be registered for $79, and to be truly useful
it needs tappet and some other utils, for extra cost, and it still beats
the pants off of CIM) The whole CI$ concept of message handling is flawed.
It would not be so bad if the traffic was not so high.  But I cannot
avoid the CI$ connection, because of Netwire!  Even the regular updates
to the NSE won't cut it if we have a problem that needs
an immediate fix.  I just am feeling quite trapped by the volume of data
that I now need to handle, just to keep up with what is possibly wrong
with our equipment.  The funny thing is, I am an extremely fast reader.
If my boss had to do this at his own reading pace, it just wouldn't get
done.  Ridiculous.  We need a new generation message handler.  Tapcis
is a decent front end, just like trn is a decent front end to netnews.
But they both break down when presented with broken conversational
threads or high message volume.  If I was just independantly wealthy, or
I worked for a company that had a reason to branch out into this kind
of software development, I'd do it meself.  As it is, I have to hope
that someone else already has.  Any suggestions?
