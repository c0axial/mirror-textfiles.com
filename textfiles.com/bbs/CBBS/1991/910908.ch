]Thanks for the idea of the doublr boot. It looks as if that may
be a little comberson, but it's better than nothing at ALL.
Thanks again!

  Many people double-boot, i.e. so they can switch back to DOS and
from there, back up the system with a DOS utility.

I used to have a login on your UNIX system (chinet).  I didn't use
the system for a while, and when I tried to log back on get a new
account the system wouldn't let me.  Did I do something wrong the
last time I had an account?  I mainly used the UNIX system to send
mail to friends on a computer in central Illinois.  If possible,
could you write me back and tell me how I could get a new login?
I would be willing to join (become a member, I think it was $25 the
last time I remember) If that is what it takes.  It is pretty
important, because I do have alot of friends on that computer in
central illinois that I would like to keep in touch with.  Once again
I really would be willing to do anything to get that login back
                          Thank you very much for your time,
                                Pete Grobarek
                              (formally STOMACH on chinet)

to ALL re: DIABLO 620 INTERFACE

I'm trying to help a friend connect a Diablo 620 serial printer
to a serial port on a IBM clone. It appears the 620 does not
work on a standard serial cable, and no he doesn't have the
manual with the pin assignments. So if anyone out
there use to use a 620 with a PC any information would be
helpful!!!!!!!
No dup. chars.
