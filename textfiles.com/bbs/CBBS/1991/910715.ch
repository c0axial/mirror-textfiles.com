  I'd just go ask on the IBMEUR forum.  State your needs.  They should
be very helpful.

  > They do not have BIOS on them
  My IDE card is specifically designed for an XT, has a BIOS on it, and
doesn't use CMOS.
  P.S. yes, I do understand my drive uses ZBR - something like 30 sectors
on the outside and 16 on the inside and something else between.
No dup. chars.
