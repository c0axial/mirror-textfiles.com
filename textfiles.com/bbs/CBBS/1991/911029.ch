]Hello, I just got your number from a friend of mine who suggested
that I call to get a listing of active bulletin boards in the Chicago

as pre-adolescent.  If you wish to respond via phone, my daytime work

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/CONTROLLER CARD IDE 

I didn't want to get a second drive, someone gave me a ide drive
I thought I would just need a controller for it, but if you can shed
some light on why it's best to buy them together it will be helpful.
also if you can help, someone told me you can use anykind of drive
except rll and mfm with this ide controller, I really don't know.
thank you for the help

Msg 45187 is 17 line(s) on 10/28/91 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ARMANDO ROSARIO re: R/CONTROLLER CARD IDE 

  Why buy drive and controller together?  Let me quote from msg 45174:
"simplicity of problem determination should you have problems".
  You don't HAVE to buy 'em from the same place, it is just if you buy
a card one place and a drive another, it is a "little bit" harder
"perhaps" to get one or the other to believe the problem is in the "part"
you bought from them (grin).
  I'm not sure what works WITH an IDE - what is your current drive?
  As to my confusion: your first msg said you were looking for an IDE
drive, your latest says you already have one.  Sorry, I don't know the
co-existance issue.
  If this is an AT, perhaps you should just buy the controller from
Compu Electronics - guy's name is Ram (pronounced Rahm) - tell him I
sent 'ya, and ask if he knows about running an IDE with an old MFM -
that you're just looking for the controller for now, but may want to buy
an ST1144 (120M or so) from him "some day".  I just feel better going to
a place with "a guy" rather than to CompUSA where you might get a different
person one time from the next.

to ALL re: PARALLEL TAPE DRIVE?

  Anyone have any experience with a parallel tape drive?  We're looking to
buy one at work - got first level of approval, assuming a cost (of one
I've seen) just under $1100.
  Thanks!

Msg 45189 is 04 line(s) on 10/28/91 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JOHN MUZZO re: BBS LISTS

  Type the command: or;1,bbs list
to do an (O)ne line summary with (R)etrieve, from msg 1, with the words
"bbs" and "list".  NOTE the punctuation, i.e. exactly a ; then a , -
you'll get steered to what BBSs have BBS lists.

Msg 45190 is 05 line(s) on 10/28/91 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to KEVIN CENTANNI re: VALIDATION

  Gee, you DO go way back!  This system has been up for nearly 14 years,
it was written up (by me) in the November '78 BYTE.  If you've seen RBBS,
that is a clone of this system.
  Sorry the software is so clumsy - it is "old" - "antique" perhaps,
but it wouldn't be a 'part of history' if we modernized it (grin).
