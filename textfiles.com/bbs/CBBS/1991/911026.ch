to ALL re: STATIC ZAP AGAIN!

  Well, it is that time of year again - the dry season in the north -
and that means static.
  A couple years ago (mebbe '87?) I blew out the serial port of my
Toshiba T1100+ when I connected the LapLink cable to my desktop - when
the low power light turned on and I reached in back to plug in the AC
adapter, I zapped static to the case, and it grounded the only place it
could find - thru the RS-232 cable.
  My Wizard 5200 hadn't been backed up in a month or so.
  ZZZZZZZZZaaaap.
  Static blew the wizard, AND MY "NEW" T1000 XE serial port!  I tried
hooking the XE via Lap Link to a machine, no go.  Tried a commo program
port to port - it would receive but not send.
  Tried a different machine AND a different Wizard link cable (hoping
only the cable (which has electronics in it) got zapped - nope, the
Wizard's xfer circuitry is gone.
  You have one VERY UNHAPPY person here, sigh.
  P.S. I think it zapped because my T1000XE was hooked to the AC supply -
otherwise there might not have been enough of a ground.
  P.P.S. I noticed my car was zapping me every time I got out of it
today as I went shopping.  Also I reached to turn on a fluorescent in the
basememt and it FLASHED from the STATIC ZAP before I got to the switch!
  I should be forbidden to work with computers!
  Heck, my sweatshirt is 63% cotton, my pants - I think 100% (jeans)!
  Aaaaaargh

to ALL re: STEPRATE.ZIP:  FAST--BUT GOOD?

    I just downloaded a freeware package called STEPRATE.ZIP, which lets
you specify a faster (or slower) stepping rate for your floppy drives.
I doubled the stepping rate on my drives, and it works great.
    The author says as long as you don't get "BAD SECTOR" errors, you can
run at any speed you want.
    My question is this:  Are there any bad side effects of running at
say, 3 ms stepping rate instead of the 6 ms that an AT system comes with?
Faster wearout of the stepper gears, quicker loss of head alignment, etc?

Have you tried tying a chain to your ankle, and letting it drag
on the ground?

Msg 45181 is 09 line(s) on 10/20/91 from CHARLIE KESTNER
to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/STEPRATE.ZIP:  FAST--BUT GOO

  When I had my CP/M box as my every-day computer, I had a set of
Shugart/Panasonic 80T/96TPI drives in there, and I pushed them to
3 ms.
  When I quit using the box in summer of 90 (put the drives in
spring of 85), they were still running, though the B: drive was
a bit tired.
  This was a floppy only machine, so the B: caught hell every day,
and swam in a sea of dust, dirt and cat hair.
  Took a licking and kept on ticking.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/SUB LIBR SYSTEM BACKWARD STE

  Thanks for the idea of checking the log since the library users are all
indepedent we have no other way of knowing how much it was used.  I have
spoken with the director of the Suburban Library System to explain the
problem and to offer any assistance.  The guy was honest and said they were
having problems and frankly user access is desirable but a low priority for
now.  He did promise to call back.  I am going to stop by to chat with my
local library director and I will continue to look for others interested in
this stuff.  With so many good BBS systems around it is hard for me to
understand why anyone would have the problems the Suburban Library System is
having?

Msg 45183 is 03 line(s) on 10/20/91 from BOB SULLIVAN
to ALL re: STEPPER MOTORS?

  Any suggestions for good books on working with stepper motors will be
appreciated.  I am playing with the idea of satelitte tracking via computer
and stepper motors.

to ROY LIPSCOMB re: ITRC

I'm just coming up for air after submitting a manuscript and
installing a couple of new software packages. Sorry I haven't had a
chance to respond to your msg (or those of anyone else, for that
matter) over on my system. If still interested in my reactions re
the ITRC, best bet would be a voice call some workday afternoon
this week: (312) 939-3300.
