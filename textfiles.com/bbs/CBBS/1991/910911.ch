  Randy doesn't call here.  He's called once since '87, and that was to
see if CBBS would answer a call after fixing it from a crash.  Call
Chinet directly, sign on as a guest.  (312) 283-0559 if memory serves me.

Msg 45122 is 03 line(s) on 09/08/91 from JERRY OLSEN
to ALL re: REMOTE COMPUTING

Does anyone know which remote software (pcAnywhere, C/O Session, etc.)
permits operation of the remote and host systems under one license rather
than requiring a separate license for each?

Msg 45123 is 03 line(s) on 09/08/91 from JIM POLOUS
to JERRY OLSEN re: REMOTE COMPUTING

PC Anywhere IV comes in three versions, Host only, Remote only, Host and
Remote.
It also comes in a LAN version with a two PC license.

Ward: I need your street address. John Wiley & Sonss
requires completion of a specific form for each person
"interviewed" for my book, including those whose interview
consisted of reading their words on Chinet!
If you can pass me your address here, I will mail you
both the form and a self-addressed stamped envelope immediately.

I think you're pretty much out of luck.  You might look into some of the
user-supported stuff like Elseware (which is actually public domain) and
Equal Partners and such -- the commercial stuff is always set up to sting
you for two licenses.  Ick.

Thanks Jerry, after I left your place I left the manual in my truck. My
sons picked last weekend to clean out the truck, and that's what they did.
However, I was able to find the 620 manual before the garbage man came.....
Thanks alot for the response, I think thing are well in hand......
Reguards..

to AL HIGGINS re: DIABLO 620 INTERFACE

The DIABLO manual lives up to its name.  The Devil wrote it. Or
translated it, because it's indecipherable.  In our edition
(1983) you could order a concordance by writing Diablo Systems,
Inc. Retail Store, 1510 Trimble Road, San Jose, CA 95131 and
requesting the API INTERFACE MANUAL, publication 90440 (request
latest version). However, don't forget to include $8.00. (Do I
detect a bit of IBM marketing?)
   Martin Seyer's book on RS-232 Made Easy shows the pins
configured as
Pin 2     Transmitted data     From 620
    3     Received data        To
    4     Request to send      From 620
    6     Data set ready       To
    7     Signal ground
   20     Data terminal ready  From 620
Hope that's true.  Best regards, Lane.

I need a new controller card for my hard card. RLL type/8 bit.
It is a Tandon TM 262 R - 20 megabytes.
Please reply to me here. I will check for messages over the next
couple of days. Thanks!

to ALL re: VOLUNTEERS NEEDED

     Are you a computer professional, advanced user, or hobbyist
who would like to volunteer your skills to a charitable organization
that needs computer help?  The Information Technology Resource
Center (ITREC) invites you to become a CompuMentor.
     The ITRC, a nonprofit organization, has provided a package of
low-cost computer help on a membership basis to more than 700
Chicago area nonprofits in the past seven years.
     Among the current Mentor assignments:  designing databases,
creating budgets, maintaining equipment, providing software
support, improving publication design, advising about network
installation, and advising about document management.  While some
projects might involve several hours a week of on-site help, others
involve taking an occasional phone call.  Some Mentors volunteer
during the day; others in the evening or weekends.  Although many
organizations requesting Mentors are located in Chicago, requests
have come from throughout the Chicago metropolitan area.
     For further information, contact Virginia Lawton Boller, ITRC,
Suite 2020, Chicago, IL 60605, 312-939-8050.
     Thanks.  And feel free to post this note on other BBSs.
