to ALL re: EXT FLOPPY CAB?

  Sheesh!  My external 1.44 started flaking out - slow to have the
drive lite come on, etc.
  So I took everything apart, cleaned the contacts, etc.  Then when
I put it together to try it, I decided to blow out the dust with one of
those bottles of compressed air.  Well, something "popped" and the power
supply died - both fuses were OK.
  I have an old 5-slot PC as my communications system, with 120M hard
drive, 9600 modem, Colorado Jumbo, etc.  I put in a bullet 286, and it
is "fine" as a communications (only) system.
  BUT now I'm thinking - should I get a new drive cabinet, or even if
that costs $60, should I put that toward a small 386SX and move
everything to it?  Looking for lots of diskette access due to Colorado,
1.44, 360, etc.
  Curious for your thoughts, sources, etc.
  P.S. I have a big 486 as my "main" system, so I'm NOT looking to spend
a lot of $$, though if a 386/33 is reasonable, I'd go for it.  This just
doesn't HAVE to be a "power" system.

        This color printer with wide carriage, sheet feeder, printer
stand and output tray has been used for less than 25 hours.  It is
LIKE NEW, and will go to the person willing to give it a good home
and give me $650.00.  Call JoAnn Vitellaro @ (708)-916-7817.

to BOB SULLIVAN re: R/PRINTER QUESTION

Bob,
  What kind of printer do you have?  I will assume that at some point in t
th epast it did print ok .  First, if the print head is removable, do
so, and get a magnifying glass and look at the face of the print head
and see if all of the pins are there (broken pin = no printing)..
If all looks OK, get some type of cleaner (contact cleaner, turner clean
with no lubricant is ok) and spray the underside of the print head where
the hammer wires are exposed.  With lots of use, the ink can collect and
stick up a pin.
  Lastly, depending on the cost of a printer head, there are companies
that rebuild them for about 1/3 of the cost of a new one.  Let me know
if you need more details.

Sounds like your printhead has lost a pin or two.  Should be an easy fix.

to ALL re: PCJR PARALLEL MODULE NEEDED

        Hello!  I just got a used IBM PCjr, but I discovered
that I can't use my parallel printer with it, since it does
not have a normal parallel port. The manual said that one
would need a parallel extension to be able to connect a
parallel printer to jr. I would by a used module and the
cable for a moderate price, and also I would consider buying
some other hardware for the jr: modem, another drive, etc.
Or if somebody have some information on where I could purchase
that kind of things, please leave a message.
Thanx.       Boris.
