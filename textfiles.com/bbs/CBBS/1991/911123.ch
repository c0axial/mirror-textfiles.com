Is there any public domain C compilers for the Amiga?  I haven't been able
to find any.  I have pascal and M68 assemblers (both PD) but no C yet.

to ALL re: PRINTER QUESTION

My dot matrix printer is not printing descending parts of characters such
as y, p, comma, etc.  I have put in a new ribbon and I still have the problem.
Is this a common problem with long used dot matrix printers?
Can I just replace a small part, maybe the print head for example?
Any help will be appreciated.
No dup. chars.
