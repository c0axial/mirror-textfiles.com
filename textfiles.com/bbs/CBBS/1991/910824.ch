]Ward,

I'd like to post a message re: the upcoming Chicago Computer Society
event featuring Philippe Khan, the president of Borland International.
It's open to the public, there will be an open raffle, and Philippe
will be discussing their database strategy in the wake of the Ashton-Tate
takeover. He'll also demo Paradox for Windows and a beta version of
the Turbo xBASE compiler. I tried to follow normal BBS procedures for
uploading a previously-created ASCII message and I got a bunch of garbage
and was unsuccessful.

Please advise. I'll log on again in a couple of days and hopefully
will have some advisory E-mail from you.

By the way, I'm the current vice president of CCS.

THANKS A LOT!

  Oh, ya, - PMAP is an extremely DOS-dependent program, - I'm sure the 
memory control blocks might change between versions.  - I'd EXPECT to have
to get a new vers for DOS 5.

PC Tools V.7 is exceptionally tightly integrated with DOS 5.0, as Central
Point and Microsoft cross-licensed portions of their code. Though Norton
and PC Tools hop-scotch each other, at this point, PC Tools really is best
with DOS 5.0. I just ordered my copy today.

Fred Kasner was a "casual guru" with the beast and likely could help you

Sounds like GEnie may be the best bet. I don't use it, but last I heard
unlimited nonprime-time access to most functions was still under $10/mo.

Msg 45080 is 10 line(s) on 08/22/91 from LYNN ANDERSON
to JERRY OLSEN re: R/ONLINE SERVICES

GENIE is a good bargin at $4.95 a month for unlimted basic services
which consists of the boards, along with games, encyclopedia,
shopping, and EASY SABRE (I have used it twice, its pretty good).
The extra pay for services such as files etc. are $6.00 hr. This
is between the hours of 6:00 PM & 6:00 AM.   The other hours are
very expensive.

I have tried AOL and found it very slow and frankley the boards are
sophmorish.   I also tried Prodigy and found it a great waste of time
watching the screens build, commericials, etc.  AOL & Prodigy are crawling

I'm leaning towards PC Tools right now and frankly they do offer more
features then does Norton at the moment.  and you're right when you say
that they leap frog each other.  I only hope the next package I buy
will last as long as my old one.  Anyway, please let me know what you
think about it.  I am most concerned about back-up, optimize, and file
recovery.

Ask for my reactions to PC Tools V.7 after 10 Sept., if still interested
then. It should arrive by then and a manuscript deadline will have passed
by that date.

Msg 45084 is 10 line(s) on 08/23/91 from JAMES SCHMIDT
to ALL re: OS/2 1.3 UPGRADE

IBM is supposidly offering users of IBM PC DOS (any version) the
opportunity to obtain an OS/2 1.3 upgrade for $99. I've also
heard that this includes a FREE upgrade to OS/2 2.0 when it's
available.
Question 1) Is the above information correct?
Question 2) Can IBM OS/2 be installed on non-IBM hardware?
Question 3) Are there any authorized locations that sell this
            upgrade over the counter for less that $99 ?
Thanks in advance,
James Schmidt

Msg 45085 is 14 line(s) on 08/23/91 from JAMES SCHMIDT
to ALL re: CLIPPER VS. FOXPRO (PART1)

.Our firm is trying to compare Clipper 5.01 with the new Foxpro 2.0
release.  We have significant investments in both products but are
interested in possibly standardizing with one.
.The compiler/linker feature of Foxpro 2.0 seems to put to rest the
final major complaint against using Foxpro over Clipper.  There are
supposedly ways to link in Whatcom 32 bit compiled "C" code but we are
having problems with that.  Unfortunately, the manuals are not very
well organized and that feature doesn't seem to be documented.
.Actually, most of our problems seem to revolve around:  How do we do
this?  & It's not in the manual.
1.  Can we get a thread going here debating both products against each
    other?
2.  Are there any Foxpro seminars sponsored in the Chicagoland area
    for under $200?

Msg 45086 is 18 line(s) on 08/23/91 from JAMES SCHMIDT
to ALL re: CLIPPER VS. FOXPRO (PART2)

Clipper has hundreds of third party libraries available, including
public domain.  Nantuckett even sponsors one on Compuserv Nanforum.  I
am not aware of "libraries" for Foxpro other than source code.  That
might be sufficient, but assembler and most "C" programmers are
excluded from contributing routines for Foxpro.
.Clipper has many linkers such as Blinker & Warplink that greatly reduce
the compile/link cycle.  Foxpro 2.0 compile link is taking 10 minutes
on a 386 machine.  Granted, you can run in interpretive mode for most
development, but we are finding things that work interpretive and bomb
when compiled.  With a make file & Blinker 1.5 we have a 10 second cycle
with Clipper 5.01.
.Foxpro 2.0 has a sophisticated CASE like environment to speed
development.  Clipper is lacking in those types of tools unless you use
the template route.
.Support at both Nantuckett and Fox (just recently) has gone into the
dumper.  It seems there are some bugs in Foxpro 2.0 and their phones
are ringing off the wall.  (They'd probably get less calls if the
manuals were more comprehensive.)   Which one seems better???????
