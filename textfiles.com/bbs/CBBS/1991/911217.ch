  If you don't want color, the DJ500C is compatible with the older
printers, no special driver would be needed, I'm quite sure.

Msg 45351 is 15 line(s) on 12/16/91 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JERRY OLSEN re: R/PC SERIAL ROUTINES

  I guess I didn't consider language - because I'd expect the routines
to be in assembler, and either available in, or able to be adapted to,
any language, such as C.  I don't KNOW, I SUSPECT "C" is what I'm
interested in - mostly because that would allow CBBS to eventually be
moved to Chinet, so it doesn't have the vulnerability of a single
machine (not backed up, etc).
  I don't know system() - "runs a command" - hmm, that should do it -
but CBBS would of course still be in memory.  No, don't like that.  I
often uploaded new versions of CBBS, then by going to DOS externally,
I rename files, and bring back up the NEW version.  (Occasionally
having to call Randy to re-name things back ;-)
  As to "lots of libraries available - see C Users Journal - actually
I HAVE the Greenleaf library already - but was looking for PD stuff
as I figured it would be "out there" somewhere, and that there might
be a "most popular" one.

to WARD re: DJ SCALABLE FONTS

Is the driver you are talking about IFW? (Intellifont for Windows)
I use both IFW and ATM together. Installing fonts into IFW is a bit
slow, but I not ahve about 40 typefaces for it. (Of course these
scalable fonts work directly on a LJ 3, instead of via software as
in a DJ.) If the fonts that your driver takes have *stupid* file names
like F0001.FF, F0002.FF, etc thats IFW.

Msg 45355
01 ?  No, not Intellifont - just "plain" HP scaleable fonts as delivered with
02 ?the DJ500C.  I guess it was surprisingly simple - I just disabled ATM,
03 ?and "poof" only the HP fonts showed up, so somehow, nicely, the two
04 ?techniques co-exist to the extent that ATM lets the HP fonts run when
05 ?it is disabled.  Somehow i thought it would be less magic and more trouble!

Phil,
   I haven't seen you floating around the BBS type world in a long time.
How is the new (older) by now job ??   Give me a call when you get a
chance.  I have a question for you relating to some old things.
