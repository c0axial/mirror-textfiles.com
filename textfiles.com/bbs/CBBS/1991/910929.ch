  I took the full CNE series, at LAN\Mind, 2000 N. Racine in Chicago.
They recently became an authorized testing location too (though on
a different floor).

  No, no real need for compression algorithm - just having fun
learning a bit more about it.
  Congrats on the column!

Jerry, you're right, I omitted the street address, which is 59 E. Van
Buren, as you stated.  The early morning gremlins strike again!  I'm
curious as to your reservations.

Msg 45152 is 17 line(s) on 09/16/91 from BILL MATTSON
to RICHARD HINTON re: R/OS AND BEYOND

Hi again. I moved the APPEND command to high memory with QEMM's
LOADHI command in my AUTOEXEC.BAT and lo and behold, I now have
622K of available memory again on the DOS side of the DOS/OS/2
dual boot set-up with OS/2 1.3. Also OS/2 seems to run all of my
DOS programs without problems...so long as I don't have conflicts
between mouse drivers or IRQ's. Some progs like QMODEM have created
problems with both, in that I have set up QMODEM to use a Logitech
mouse driver and Logitech CLICK menus, and this doesn't work when
the OS/2 mouse driver is loaded. Also QMODEM's IRQ apparently
conflicts with OS/2 or vice versa. This is only true in the
"compatibility box", as a dual (reboot) boot of DOS or OS/2 actually
reloads the complete (whichever) environment as if a cold boot has
been done. But in general, the compat-box with 512K runs most every
thing I've tried, including some text-based windowing progs I have
written, that I didn't expect would run in the compat-box. So in
summary, I guess although OS/2 requires the APPEND statement in the
DOS AOTOEXEC.BAT, you can run it into high memory, no problem...BYE

 Does anyone know where I can obtain plans or a device to create my
own subliminal messages on tape? Im looking for a device to help me
with a specific problem I have and none of the tapes on the market
have topics. Any info would be appreciated.

Msg 45155 is 09 line(s) on 09/17/91 from ANDREW DECKOWITZ
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/CNE?

I am considering becoming a CNE.  I just got the info book from Novell
(And it took the full 6 weeks, of course - everything else I have ever
requested from Novell took less than 2 1/2 weeks to arrive).
The listed prices for the courses, or even the CBT or self-study materials,
are ridiculous!  $6115 for the courses or $3095 for self-study PLUS
$490 for the exams!  Were the courses more reasonably priced at LAN/Mind?
At these prices I will never be able to convince my boss to go for it.
And because the courses are graded only pass/fail, even if I take them
under my company's education plan, I only get 50% reimbursement.

to ALL re: TRAFFIC

Why is there no traffic?  There have been no new messages
for over a week, and the phone was not answering during that
period either.  Was there a hardware problem?
No dup. chars.
