to ALL re: FLOPPY PROBLEMS

 I can't believe it!
 I zapped the power supply on my external floppy cabinet, bought a
new one, and the drive was STILL flakey - changed for ANOTHER 1.44
drive, STILL flakey!
 Guess what - turned out that I changed one parm on the floppy driver
for a DIFFERENT drive - and it effected THIS drive to cause read errors!
SO I NEVER HAD ANY HARDWARE PROBLEMS - but 2 hrs and $120 later (new
cabinet/power supply) I'm back running.
 Whine.

to MARTY DIPPEL re: R/MICROEMACS V3.11 SOURCE

I just pulled down 3.11 from SIMTEL20 today (anonymous FTP to
WSMR-SIMTEL20.AMRY.MIL).  All sources are there,
as well as PC executables.  3.11 is much smaller than the
previous versions -- about 50% of the size of 3.10e -- but
starts more slowly.  It has a lot more smarts, though, and a few
new features that are really nice.  Supposedly, there's a new
new version of MicroSpell as well...

like the thing I was looking for in all the small LIBs around. Was
wondering if anyone else is using GENUSes toolkits? I plan to
get at least 2 more of their kits but was wondering if the other
ones are worth it. They probably are, middle range of price and
seem quite good for graphics.

Msg 45295 is 11 line(s) on 11/27/91 from JERRY OLSEN
to BOB SULLIVAN re: R/PRINTER QUESTION

As some others have suggested, the problem *could* be in the printhead.
Unfortunately, this sort of problem can have quite a variety of causes,
which you would need to address one at a time. Among them. . . .The
alignment of the printhead in relation to the carriage may have become
mucked up. Many dot matrix printers have alignment screws. Have you
checked the manual? A related possibility would be to adjust the
carriage, though this is less likely to help. A bad contact or line
on the cable can lead to results like this. For many printers,
replacing the printhead is more costly than it's worth, but some of
the cleaning ideas you've received might help. I've also seen this type
of problem when a chip which instructs the printhead goes bad.

Say, do you have any idea who does the "official" EMACS updates?  I
mean, everybody and his brother screws around with it, but who keeps
track of the "real" thing?  Is there some sort of revision clearing

I have that address readily at hand, so to save Ward a second or
three <G>, it is:
Disk Drive Repair, Inc.; 8220 S.W. Nimbus; Beaverton, OR 97005; tel.
(503) 626-7104....But I've heard more favorable comments and reports
about a couple of alternatives, if you want to check them out....
ONTRACK in Minnesota is at (800) 872-2599. A few additional alternatives
are: Paul Mace Software, also in Oregon, at (800) 523-0258; Rotating
Memory Services in California at (800) 488-DRIVE; Statewide Computer
Support here in Illinois at (708) 983-6000 or (800) 882-8311 and
Barry Workman & Associates--also in California--at (818) 794-7979.
Depending upon your specific needs, Technical Parts (California) may
be able to help, (619) 546-8188 and Seagate will respond to *questions*
about HDs from any manufacturer by calling (800) 468-3472.
        The above resources are from my personal data base but I can't
necessarily vouch for them all. But ONTRACK has consistently had the
best rep, though it ain't the cheapest.
        Hope this helps....

Thanks for the help, Andy...  I'll have to see if I can get Randy at chinet
to pull it down for me, or if I can ftp it from gagme.  I still have
version 3.9 running here on my PC and at the Sun at work. It's OK, but
might as well be up to date, eh?  Pity it starts more slowly... that's
my only real objection to Version 3.9.  Oh well-- if it has more smarts, it's
worth it!

One last thing: Did I get the address right: WSMR-SIMTEL20.AMRY.MIL or is
that supposed to be ....ARMY.MIL ?

Tony has a better idea, if you don't mind the time spent uploading it all.
It would be a lot easier for me to get it from his board, plus it would
become available to others in this area.  As far as I know, if you upload
it there, Tony would be the only BBS in the Chicago area to have the latest
version of MicroEMACS.  I'm sure others would enjoy having local access to
it as well.  Again, thanks!
