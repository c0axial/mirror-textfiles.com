to BILL MATTSON re: R/HP DESKJET 500 INKJET PRINTE

  Surprising limitations of the Deskjet 500 and 500C?  Nothing obvious!
  I am so pleased with my DJ that I upgraded it to a 500, then when the
500C came out, I bought one!  (upgrading gives you a 90 day warranty unless
there's old warranty left on your to-be-upgraded printer, while buying new
gives you 3 years!
  The speed is limiting of course - 2 PPM or more in text mode - while it
might take - well, probably CPU-bound doing fancy color stuff, but perhaps
4 minutes per page.
  The overheads are expensive since they must have a water soluble surface-
about $1 each.
  The 500C is basically an electronics-only update of the 500, with an added
mechanism for detecting the (3-) color cartridge.  It uses "chemistry magic"
to combine the 3 colors to produce a darn good black.  The only problem
I've really seen is "gray" is more of a dark green.
  The 500C can be used with a black cartridge just like a 500 - the printer
detects which cartridge, and won't print "ordinary" things with color in it,
and won't print color with the black cartridge in it.  It "centers" the
cartridge and blinks a "change cartridge" LED.
  What does it emulate? N-O-T-H-I-N-G.  The DJ is so widely accepted they
don't even SUPPORT the Epson or Proprinter cartridges in the 500C.
  HP PCL is the language used by LaserJets.  Some examples of what is used
are things like (where $ is an esc):
6 point Courier @ 20 CPI= $&l0O$(10U$(s3t0B$(s0p06v20h0S$&l12D
DJ 500 12 point CG Times= $&l0O$(10U$(s4101t0B$(s1p12v12h0S$&l6D
BOLD=$(s3B
normal (Not Bold)=$(s0B
  That is not meaningful - if I typed what "Postscript is" if you'd not
seen it before, you'd say "Wow!" - but what matters is drivers - nearly
every appropriate modern product has it, and the Windows 3 driver is
simply STUNNING (while bringing a 486 to its knees in highest quality mode)

Msg 45306 is 21 line(s) on 12/03/91 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to BILL MATTSON re: R/HP DESKJET 500 INKJET PRINTE

  The ONE thing I wish were easier, is having multiple cartridges - I
liked re-inking one to BLUE - but there was no effective way to keep one
cartridge from drying out while the other was in use.
  The DJ500C solved that by having a 2/3-size of a "recipe box" sized
box with lid, that has holes for 1 black and 1 color cartridge, with the
appropriate rubber thingie in the bottom to seal the jets.  (It doesn't
ACTUALLY "seal" the jets but rather kind of "puts them in a tiny house"
where they aren't touching anything, but where there's only a miniscule
amount of air to draw moisture out of the ink.  I've had no problems
in a couple weeks, but the REAL test will be if it is unused for a month
or more).
  One SMALL surprise was "banding" when printing a VERY complex color print
out of Corel draw.  Turns out that is documented: print to disk, THEN copy
the file to the printer.  Turns out the "chemistry" doesn't work if say the
magenta dries before the yellow mixes with it to produce red.  By printing
to disk, the printing occurs fast enough (not CPU bound) that the ink colors
mix "wet" and the resultant "identical data stream" output was PERFECT.
  I've found only one teeny bug in the driver - when printing say a box
with a light grey error-distributed dither scatter, it leaves a small white
band near the top of the box.  Error distributed dithers are the best kind,
because they avoid regular patterns common with most dithering techniques.

In reference to the companies listed in #45298, Technical parts has a clea
clean room, and and tetst the internal amplifiers inside of the drive
mechanism.  They do not ( or did not) do data recovery.  I also have used
Barry Workman & Assoc.  They have a 3 tier price schedule which works
out very good if you have a little extra time.

to RICHARD HINTON re: R/HARD DRIVES?

WHile I am sure one of these days the following will not be true, to-date,
I have never removed a dead seagte drive from any of my computers, or
that of any client.  While performance varies with price and size,
they are good drives.

to MARTY DIPPEL re: R/TONY'S BOARD

I'd upload it there, but I'm calling from upstate NY, a bit (so to
speak) at a time.  You have the right internet address
-- WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.  It's an old DEC computer at the
White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) that somehow got to be an archive
site for just about EVERYTHING.  I've been using it for years, now;
it still has the best archive of CP/M related materials I've ever
seen, and it does very well on the DOS side, too.  And, if you have
access to the internet, it's free.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: INKJETS

Ward, thanks for the responses. I'll take a little off-line time
to digest it all. I did go to Elektek and get a demo of both printers.
Still a little concerned about fonts, and such. I've never done any
desktop publishing, and don't have any of the state-of-the-art word
processors, although I do have Windows 3.0. The sales person at
Elektek seemed to be saying that one would need more than just the
printer to do all the fancy stuff the demo pages are showing.

to MIKE ROSE re: CHICAGO AREA BBS LISTING

 <Pardon me for answering your comment directed to A.Z....>
  Ward stopped keeping the list here several years ago, since it was
taking way too much time to massage it into a format he could tolerate.
  You can call the keepers of said list, Stillwaters BBS, at 708-403-2826
(it's a "donation" baord, but they don't holler if all you want is to
snatch the list).
  Or, call Randy's unix system at 312-283-0559.  If you do that, the
file you want is /usr/public/bbslists/cbbsnnnn.nam - where 'nnnn' is
the month/year of the list.  (If you don't "do unix", don't bother, you'll
be hopelessly confused...)

Good question! I would have assumed it would be in the DOCs. I personally do
not use EMACS (been a BRIEF user for 6 or 7 years), but I know Marty Dippel
uses it. Try leaving him a message.

I currently have 4 seagates drive, which total 2.8 gigabytes, they all run
365 days/year, 24 hours/day...I've never had the slightest <knocking on
wood> problem any of them. I would be inclined to say that most modem
Hard disk drives are pretty good.
