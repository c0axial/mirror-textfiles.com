just the TTL XOR of hsync and vsync.

  Picked up one at ElekTek, Lincolnwood, Sat.  $725.  Amazing little
machine!  Been having TOO much fun with it - up until nearly 4:00 AM
Sat PM.
  Comes with a very sophisticated driver - scaleable fonts, AND one
of those fancy error-distributed dithering techniques (avoids repeated
patterns).  However, that really sucks up "CPU cycles" doing it.
  If I can answer any questions, don't hesitate to ask!

Trying to get more information about my hard disk noise, I learned that
Western Digital has a toll free number where they answer all questions
about equipment, service, technical specs, etc.  The number is
(800) 832-4778.  Incidently, the tech said that the 2 drives should not
sound different.

  It was smart of me when I first got my 386 fully installed to do
a screen dump of the "setup" menu. The batteries went dead (3 years?)
and it only took a few minutes to open, change and resetup with the
HD numbers listed easy enough to just copy. Wouldhave taken over
a day to make calls otherwise.

Thanks for the offer.  Does this work on Apple computers? I'm
guessing that it is IBM.
As an update I luckily have a VISUAL 102 at work now so I can get
into SWAN via VT100.  Still home computer users with Apple etc can get in
only intermittently and with tons of garbage on the screen.

  Sorry, Randy doesn't call this system any more.  He still "runs" it
(supplies power & phone line, and occasional heroic efforts at keeping
old hardware going) but he doesn't CALL.  You need to do Chinet to
reach randy.  (312) 283-0559 as I recall is the guest line.

Msg 45252 is 13 line(s) on 11/14/91 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to ALL re: STICKTION

I saw this term used recently to apply to a problem I have
with a Seagate 238 drive (yeah, it's old, and CHEAP).  If
my office has been cool, I can't get the HD to spin up.  I have to
reach under the drive and twist the head positioning motor's shaft a
little bit.  THEN I turn on the power and get spin-up.

I've been told that this occurs because there is a lubricant on the surface
of the disk itself, and this tends to build up at the edges and capture
the head, preventing the drive from starting.  The lubricant story sounds
weird to me, but my solution (discovered independently one day when
I came in to work and things got crazy) always works.
 Is there a fix?  Or am I facing a dead drive one of these days?  I'd
like to be able to close the case again!

Msg 45253 is 10 line(s) on 11/14/91 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/STICKTION

  One day, my ST-225 locked up.  I was visiting Randy at the time.  The
ST225 was in my IBM Portable (Luggable).  Randy said "Easy, we'll just
spin the drive" and went looking for a screwdrive.
  I said "Hey, I'm not a "physics graduate" for nothing!" - and proceeded
to pick the entire PC up, rotate it slowly about 1/4 turn, then "snap" it
back - turned on, the drive came right up.  Inertia had loosened up the drive.
  I passed this info on, and have had positive feedback from at least two
other people that this "inertial" technique worked.  One was a PC, the
other a SCSI drive in a Keyboard Synthesizer.
  P.S. this is the ONLY time I've out-hardware'ed Randy Suess (grin).

I was looking into picking up a regular deskjet as they've come
down to $399, but if I can get color, and for under $800 that doesn't
sound bad at all!!!!! Most of my work would require BW, but having color
around wouldn't be bad if you know what I mean..... I may just run
by ET in Willowbrook and look at one. Tried 3-4 wks ago and they didn't
have any in... Thanks for the info.....

Msg 45255 is 08 line(s) on 11/14/91 from BENJAMIN COHEN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/PARALLEL TAPE DRIVE?

We reviewed a couple of them (Law Office Technology Review), one from
Interpreter  and one from Valitek. Both work nicely; Valitek claims to
do more error checking.  I'm sort of looking now at the MicroSolutions
unit, which is a lot smaller.  If you plan on moving it from place to
place (as well as within an office), the MicroSolutions is much more
portable.  The two we looked at ran 6-7 inches by 14 inches by about 3.
The MicroSolutions unit is a LOT smaller at about (I'm estimatingg
from memory) about 9 inches by 4 inches by maybe two.

Msg 45256 is 13 line(s) on 11/14/91 from BENJAMIN COHEN
to WARD CHRISTENSON re: STATIC

Instaed of Static Guard, get some Downy and a spray bottle.  Mix one
part downy with two parts water.  Spray it on the carpet all around
the computer area -- even on the wool chair.

3M used to sell a stick-backed strip that you could attach to the front
of the keyboard and ground the attached wire.  Touch the strip first
when you sit down at the computer.  They even had (for all I know
the stuff is still being sold) a mat that you could put your monitor/
keyboard/whatever on and ground.  I think the Trademark name was
something like Touch Me First.

My computer room has tile.  It reduces static problems, significantly.

Yes, tell me more! How good is the output? Does it have a good Windows 3
driver? What Apps (Windows or others) support color? How much does it cost
to operate, $$ for inkjet refills and approx lifespan.
Since we now have a Elek-tek out my way I could go see one.
Last printer I bought was right before the last CBBS birthday party! At
Elek-tek of course.

Msg 45258 is 10 line(s) on 11/15/91 from JIM STEPHENS
to WILLIAM DAVIES re: R/CD-ROM

Mr Davies,
I think that you can use the setver command to get dos to use your
extensions.  I have used them with the AMDEK cd/rom drive that I have.
Also, you need only obtain the extensions, and need not worry about
whether they are matched exactly to your drive, since all versions
of the extensions work with dos and not with the drive.  You still
might have problems with your drivers.  My version was with 4.01
which did require a new version over the ones which worked with
version 3.3.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: OLD COMPUTERS NEVER DIE

Ward,
I noticed that you had run this bbs on a northstar horizon.  I have
a collection of them and not much software for them.  I have CPM for
both the standard density and double density versions, and some
other software as well.  Any advice about whethere any hard drives
will work on them?  I did not anticipate ever needing to know so
I don't have much info about what was used with them.  I have
many perfectly good 10 mb ST 506 interface drives, but anything
would require a BIOS and an idea about the interface.  This is
only an inquiry in case I should run across the boards at a swap
meet for now, since all of the units I have are duafloppy drive units.
I sure hate to see any machine as nicely built as the northstar
go to waste.  I have several ALSPA units which have corvus drives
on them which are much nicer for what i use now.  I have seven of
the northstars which came from a law office.  This is a nice
board to see running for so long.

Hi All,

this message here.  I go to college, work as a security, an electric
a stationary engineer.  I have an Amiga (actually 2). Well gotta go.

Msg 45261 is 23 line(s) on 11/15/91 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/STICKTION

Well, I'm just a lowly sociologist, but I didn't think that
flipping the whole #$! PC (it's an ancient XT) was going to be
worth it on a regular basis, so I resorted to twiddling with
the drive.  I now have it set up beside my desk with the top off so
that I can easily put a finger on the shaft of the head motor.  But
it's such a pain anyway!  I guess one fix would be to
preheat the drive (GRIN!).  But as long as it keeps the drive
working.

On another topic -- how did IBM go about designing their power supply
ventilation system, and why does everyone copy it??  As built,
all IBM systems SUCK air through the disk drives iinto the case,
and exhaust air out through the PS.  This means that dust, dirt,
smoke, ETC, get a free ride through the system before being dumped out.

The only machines I've seen that don't do this are Zenith products.
I'm sitting next to a '151 which pumps air OUT through the drives and
front ventilation ports, and I sometimes use a 386SX Zenith at work that
has a similar arrangement.  Back when I was a ham operator, I could have
sworn that good design dictated the Zenith approach...but I'm just
a lousy sociologiist (no, scratch that, a pretty good one!),
so I don't know beans about engineering.  Any
good technical explanations?

Hey, what a great idea - screen-dumping your CMOS SETUP.  What I do
is have a "hobby manual" that I log stuff in - therefore things like
drive types, write precomp, and things I may need years later, are
in one place.  I may screen-dump and file the dump in the book in the
future!  Great!

  Today I was at lunch with a guy who had one of these fancy 300 DPI
wax transfer printers.  He said his looked about 2x as good as the DJ-
BUT it cost 10x!  ;-)

  The smallness of the Microsolutions is that it uses the DC-2000/2120
tapes.  Did the other biggies use more like a DC-600 sized tape?  (I
say "sized" because I don't know my tape nomenclatures.  If you DO happen
to know some specs I'd appreciate hearing them just for my general info).

  Adding to your tip, what I would do is use Downy, with DISTILLED
water.  Not "much" better than tap water, but a little!  Actually,
with all the dryer sheets these days, I don't HAVE Downy "in stock",
may try to remember to pick some up.  Strangely, I was only annoyed
by static that one day!

  Does the Color Deskjet (DJ500C) have a good Windows driver?  Would
"superb" be a good word?
  It used something like Floyd-Steinberg error-distributed dithering,
but takes ENORMOUS computing power to do so.  What this means is that
instead of doing "patterns" to handle various levels of color intermix,
it "randomizes" the dot placement.  Sort of like putting 100 people
in the middle of a gymnasium floor, and saying "Ok, everyone go about 3'
from the next person - but don't line up in any rows or anything".  That
would be a certain density.  Then you might say "OK, stand 5 feet from
the nearest person" - that would be a lower density.
  It even has an EXCELLENT test print - showing how your printer and
your choice of paper would print at low, medium, and high density color
settings (there are 5 settings for density, 3 types of paper, 2 color
settings (8 color and "infinite color"), 3 settings of dithering
(don't remember names, but something like "simple", "complex dither",
and the random one I forget the name of (It is NOT called Floyd-Steinberg
on the screen).
  Refills are $26 (14.50 for B/W).  Don't know print life.  B/W is 500
pages; the big diff is that color you're usually doing graphics - imagine
a fill going from blue to green - across the entire page - that would
be mebbe a 7 x 9 area of solid blue - how many square inches that is
(63) compared to say a typical page of text (mebbe 1-3 square inches
of real ink).  I'd guess 100 sheets or so - but really have no idea.
  You will LOVE it.  I also just upgraded my Pizazz, and bought their
add-on program to convert graphics formats to pizazz format - I should
theoretically be able to do some many-hour ray traces in 24-bit Targe
mode, and without losing resolution, turn it over to Pizazz to print.
  I may take the package back if it doesn't do an error-distributed
either, which I consider "mandatory" now that my level of expectation has
been raised by the standard HP driver.

  I don't understand the issue of the fan in PCs.  Whether they
sucked it or blew it, the same volume of air, with the same yuck,
would go where ever the air goes.  Or did you want to put a filter
on the fan?
  (thinking...)  Ok, I'll bet it is because the power supply is
"cheap" compared to memory and circuit boards, so they gave the more
expensive components the "first shot" at the colder air, rather
than pre-heating it in the power supply before sending it to the
boards and motherboard.
  I am very impressed with some of the engineering of new IBM products -
like putting the BIOS on the hard disk, so it can be upgraded with a
diskette, etc.  Another thing - barely noticed - I was "fiddling" with
a floppy, and noticed there is a DOOR - black - so as to be invizobobble -
INSIDE the floppy - behind the slot.  Presumably it specifically keeps
the drive cleaner, but has a VERY weak spring so you don't even notice
it is there.
