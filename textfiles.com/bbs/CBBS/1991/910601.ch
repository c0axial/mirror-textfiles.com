  What do I think of Gateway's little cardboard extravagance?  I ripped it
out, in doing so, partly destroyed PC mag, finally threw the whole magazine
away, and wrote a letter cancelling my subscription (I'd paid thru '93).
Ditto Computer Shopper - got one from a friend yesterday - found only way
to really remove Gateway ad was to tear the mag apart there.  Decided to
toss the whole thing and ask they guy not to bring it to me any more (and
I do mean FREE).
  I got a call from a neighbor lady saying how cute the ad was - something
about black and white and color.  I said I couldn't see giving them the
respect of "reading" the ad - only resenting, hating, rejecting, etc. ;-)
  Right now, Scientific American is the ONLY magazine I subscribe to.

take that also.
