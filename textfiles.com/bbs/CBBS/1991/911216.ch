Msg 45339 is 09 line(s) on 12/12/91 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: PC SERIAL ROUTINES

  If you were writing a serial comm program from scratch, what would you
use for the low-level I/O drivers?
  Also, if CBBS were to be re-written for the PC, (it is RUNNING on a PC,
but using 8080 emulation!) how would the DOS access be handled?  I'm doing
it now via "ctty com1" which is executed only if a password is entered,
etc.
  Is there a standard library of these routines?  Or does every BBS
writer create their own?
  Thanks!

If you want to program the COM port yourself, interrupt driven
serial i/o is covered well in the following book:
The Waite Group's MS-DOS Developers Guide
Publisher: Howard W. Sams
Date:1989 (2nd Edition) - 3rd may be out by now

Look on page 468

As for accessing DOS, I would recommend something like PC-Anywhere III.
There all interrupts that you can call to disable it's output so that
while you're doing your own i/o it, won't interfere.  In fact, you
can write your program to utilize the PC Anywhere communication i/o
routines. CTTY is fine as long as you stay in DOS. Don't try to go
into GWBASIC or any application that uses cursor control! PC-Anywhere III
even handles graphics based programs if you wanted to run something like
that from remote.
Although I dont believe DMA documents the interrupts used to control
PC-Anywhere III, they are listed in a book called PC INTERRUPTS. My copy
is at work, so I don't have an author or publisher, but it is new
(I got mine at Waldenbooks about a week ago). If you need any infor
about it, let me know I'll get you publisher/author. I believe it
was about $39 for the PC INTERRUPTS book.

There is a well  documented interface that Fido and Opus bulletin
boards used called a FOSSIL (Fido Opus Seadog Standard Interface Layer)
That is available on many bulletin boards (US Robotics comes to mind{)
Look for files called X00.SYS or something like that.
It functions as a device driver, and is very reliable.

Hi Byron! Well I use too have lots of interest for the DEC RAINBOW 100
computer. As I bought a bunch of software for it at bargain prices.
Unfortunately... I just gave them all away for free. Another thing about
this computer is that I never had seen one in my life. I still haven't
either, just some software for it.

Is it true that 3.5 (720K format) are about 95us in access time?

Msg 45345 is 25 line(s) on 12/15/91 from JERRY OLSEN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/PC SERIAL ROUTINES

(It would help if you suggested what language you might use <G>.)

Someone mentioned FOSSIL drivers. I recall seeing a bundle of related
stuff--which may or may not contain what you would need--over on the
U.S. Robotics BBS in Skokie awhile ago.

Assuming the language is C (which I _think_ I saw somewhere on CBBS in
Dolton), several low-level serial I/O packages are available. I just
wish I recalled where I've seen 'em advertised! I _think_ it was in the
C Users Journal, but it may have been in PC Mag. or PC World. Also,
shareware packages are floating around. I've seen 'em either in
Shareware Mag.'s back section (the current month's issue contains a
cover article by me <G>) or in the Encyclopedia of Shareware. Even if
you're thinking of being masochistic about it and programming in
Assembler <G>, running the source through to an .ASM file obviously
would be a major start.

If you _are_ thinking about C and your needs are simple--basic
file maintenance with text-based utilities, the simplest solution
obviously would be to use system() or an alternate. In fact, I'd be
inclined to do that with the fxn you would write which invokes
system() offering a simple, password-protected menu to execute your
most common tasks.

Have I missed the mark entirely? <GGG>

Does anybody have a working boot disk for the famous CP/M for the
C64? I know the darn thing is about worthless, but my disk died
and I can't seem to bring it back to life. I wonder if Commodore
will still have a replacement copy around?

Ya, but some of the software packages I use do not have drivers for
HP500s. Does the 500C take a different driver than the 500?
If things are quiet at work this week I'll be heading over to ET
to pick up a 500C. I let you know how it goes.....

to JERRY OLSEN re: R/DEC RAINBOWS

Thanks for the response about the DEC Rainbow. It's
truely a collectors item. I guess the drawback is
not being able to upgrade it. If somebody desparately
needs one (for parts, etc.) I would consider trading
for something, but for now I will probably just use
the monitor (and prop my door open with the pedestal).

I don't know exactly, but it would probably be somewhere around there.
