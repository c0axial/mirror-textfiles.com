Msg 45364 is 09 line(s) on 12/21/91 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to ALL re: 22-DISK USERS OUT THERE?

I've pretty much converted from CP/M to DOS (especially now
that I have 4DOS installed), but I need help with some disk
conversions.  I have 22DISK, but there's no built-in definition
for Kaypro w/Advent TurboROM.  Has anyone written one
of these?  I need the DSDD Advent format.  I suppose that if
nothing else works, I can always justuse the CP/M
machine and write things  out to DOS format disks, but
it'd be a lot faster to use 22DISK, and I have HUNDREDS of
text disks that I need to convert.  Anyone have any ideas?

to JERRY OLSEN re: R/CP/M ON COMMODORE 64

Thanks Jerry! Although that sounds like it's worth a shot. The odds
of finding a C64 user who used the CP/M 2.2 is like finding a needle
in the haystack. Though finding a CP/M user on the C128 is a completely
different story. I suppose the best thing to do is to write to
Commodore and see if they will still replace the CP/M 2.2 boot disk.

This is referenced to your message numbered 45349. As odd is this may
seem... but I have no idea what you are referring to or what what your
talking about. Can you elaborate a bit?

Msg 45368 is 03 line(s) on 12/22/91 from MICHAEL SHARTIAG
to BILL WOLFF re: CP/M

OK...OK.... 'we' will check the archives and my list of old timers
who took care of the CP/m stuff.... Specifically, you are using the
C64 version, (cartridge expansion) , pre C128 edition ?

Msg 45369 is 06 line(s) on 12/22/91 from MICHAEL SHARTIAG
to ALL re: IBM PS2/60 & 1MEG SIMMS

I am working on an IBM PS2/60.  It has 256K real IBM simms in it.
(they still seem to be into metal packaging at least in 1987)
Anyways, I would like to put 1Meg simms in the system board if
possible.  The machine did not recognize them and I had to put the
old 256K ones back in.  Is there an update or other means to install
them?  Is my best bet a BOCA expansion board ???

Msg 45370 is 05 line(s) on 12/23/91 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to ANDY SHAPIRO re: 22-DISK

I would be surprised if the Advent TurboROM used a non-Kaypro format
when installed into a Kaypro machine.  The DSDD Kaypro format (394K)
is probably the same one that non-TurboROM's use.  If so, you can
use the /KAY2 option (unless there is a /KAY4 option) of 22-DISK to read
your Kaypro disks on your PC.

Msg 45371 is 04 line(s) on 12/23/91 from BILL WOLFF
to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/CP/M

Thanks Michael! Yes it is the pre128 type. I do also use the C128 CP/M
as well. Though I am trying to get the C64 CP/M to fire up again. I can
use it on a SX64 which is somewhat portable, which would be handy for
me right now.

Msg 45372 is 03 line(s) on 12/23/91 from PHIL JERN
to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: IBM SIMMS

Hiya Mike!  I have that modem power supply for you.  The PS/2 SIMMS
are proprietary, standard off the shelf ones will not work.  I tried
that myself early on, and couldn't get it to work.

Well scratch the idea of getting the CP/M boot disk for the
CP/M 64 cartridge from Commodore. They don't have any.

to ALL re: THE LAST LASER?

When I saw an ad for the new IBM Laserwriter 6, which has 600by600
resolution (as compared to 300by300 currently) I wonder if this
product will knock out the others like HP, Epson etc.?

Msg 45375 is 02 line(s) on 12/23/91 from BILL WOLFF
to RICHARD HINTON re: R/THE LAST LASER?

600x600 has been out for a long time now. I don't think things
are going to change much.

Msg 45376 is 03 line(s) on 12/23/91 from PHIL JERN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: KEYBOARDS

Ward, I have a copy of the official IBM wiring diagram for the enhanced AT
keyboard cable (I saw your note in KEYBOARD FORUM on VM).  Call me
@764-1375 if I can help you.

Msg 45377 is 09 line(s) on 12/23/91 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/22-DISK

Well, be surprised!  The TurboROM _can_ use the standard
Kaypro format, but also includes a more efficient format -- 382K
per disk, DSDD, with 255 directory entries
(this latter is especially nice with DOS+ or one of its derivatives,
which uses 20% of the directory entries for storing date/time
info.  ANyway, the point is that my TURBOROM disks are all in the
special format, since it was an all around 'better' format for me to
use.  I can probably hack up a definiiton for it, but I was hoping someone
else had already done the work...

Msg 45378 is 13 line(s) on 12/23/91 from ED FOSTER
to WARD re: FONTS & FOOTBALL

  There is a diskette containing drivers included with the printer.  I
didn't look at it because I was trying to write a simple driver for one of
my own programs.  I don't recall what the label said, but I think it included
Windows, WordStar and WordPerfect.  I'll look it up the next time I work on it.
  The commands to select the type size involve the usual (for Epson) 16-bit
binary sent as two characters.  Of course, you need transparency to be sure
the binary gets to the printer.  The HP Series III uses pure ASCII, with no
control characters, so you don't need transparency to specify scalable fonts.
You do need it for font download, of course.  And the HP has the full range,
by quarter points, up to 999 points.
  Incidentally, I hear that the Detroit Lions will be using a special
typeface on their playoff tickets.  Since Detroit is in Wayne County, they
will be featuring Wayne Fonts exclusively.  Remember, you heard it here first.
