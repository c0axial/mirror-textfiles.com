  Just put in an ST1144 124M IDE disk.  Among the menu items in the
menus gotten to via Debug are "Primary format".  Anyone know if that is
a REAL low level format, or just one of those "trick it into thinking so"?
  Anyone have any details about this drive?  I got NO info on either the
controller or the drive!

I've managed to avoid C'serve to date. Though I had thought of it (and some
competitors) in the context of the current article, I'd so far shied away
from the idea due to my unfamiliarity with their forums and not wanting to
invest too much time learning about them with the rather substantial amount
of work for the article pending. But with your specific recommendation of
a forum, I may take the plunge--esp. after a C'serve trial offer I just
received which is far more attractive than the run-of-the-mill offers I
regularly receive from them. That offer and your suggestion together
probably will tempt me to explore there. Thanx....

to ALL re: 3270 FILE TRANSFER

In looking at the various 3270 file transfer packages - like Tempus Link and
the IBM IND$FILE software - the thought struck me...
How do these packages handle the binary file transfers that will have the
hex chars x'00' thru x'40' that the 3270 data stream will interpret as
control characters...  I'm thinking of the SBA (start buffer address) and t
field attributes.   The attributes might make it thru to the screen buffer
but the SBA certainly would not.
So, with an IRMA card and Tempus Link (or the like) how are transparent
binary file transfers accomplished???   Binary with no translation - just
storing the data on the mainframe as a virtual diskette file for the PC.

Oh sorry Murray, I didn't mean to sound so gloomy. I guess it hit me
funny. Oh well, that's life.

The July 8, 1991 issue of Info World's Buyers Advisory column by Brett Glass
discusses formatting IDE drives. I don't know if any of the info in that column
is of any value to you, but it may be worth looking at.
No dup. chars.
