Hi Kevin! Thanks for the information about Boardwatch and Prodigy. I had
never known that there were BBS magazines out there in the first place. I
was at the Book Market yesterday and picked up a copy. They have about 6
or so still left. I also found another BBS magazine called Telecomputing
there also. It too seems to be a very good magazine. Do you subscription
to any of those magazines?

One point made in the Boardwatch Magazine (June 91) is that Prodigy could
theoretically be pulling data off your hard disk, but not very likely.
Some of my personal notes turns up nothing interesting with Prodigy v2.1
software other then what we already know. On the other hand, the brand new
version called v3.1, adds another file called PROFILE.DAT and updates
every time you call Prodigy. What this file contains is everything
connected to your computer. Number of RAM, drives, hard drives, DOS
version, and lots of other interesting data. Some of these things are not
necessary for Prodigy to know. For example, I am running off a floppy
drive and why would Prodigy care how many hard drives I have connected?
Why does it need this information anyway? It's a neat small file that can
be uploaded to Prodigy with ease. Did all this attention give them some
ideas? Someone once said if your accused of something and your not doing
it, then you might as well do it and gain some benefit from it. Does
Prodigy think this way too?

  I was quick in writing any comments in the BBS msg but I think they
are consice and to the point. The BASIC questions don't seem to help
ME decide which way to alter my pgm. Like a BBS. I just use the Krishna
BBS as "A" BBS for messages if ayone wants to use the computer and
most importantly of all..... a phone number LOOKS better than just
a P.O. number. Then again AFTER an order I sometimes use the home
address on communications. I just don't want to be bothered by
wackos by distributing a number internationally.
  Another answer to a theoritical question is: the Palmistry pgm
is taking off better now probably due to the "times" of v\change
we are going thru. A pgm can be set in motion if it coincides with
what people MIGHT want to use at "A" specific time (year). I personally
thought this would have taken off a few months back.

to ALL re: CRT LIFETIMES

Regarding the recent comments aon CRT life.  The primary cause for CRT failure
is cathode failure.  The cathode has a finite life because barium is constantly
evaporated while it is heated.  When the cathode coating evaporates to 1/2 the
original thickness, the cathode is considered spent.  Increasing the cathode
heater voltage will get some added barium migration for a short time.  What
tis means is the life of a CRT is mostly related to the length of time the
cathode is at operating temperature.  It would seem prudent to turn the CRT off
when not in use.  However, depending on gun design, a cathode may have a
useful life from 5000 to 10,000 hours.  So turning the CRT on and off every
10 minutes probabaly won't improve the life of the tube.  By the way, in
today's tubes when images are burned into the screen.  It generally isn't
the phosphor being burned.  The glass is actually retaining the image because
the x-rays emitted from the mask cause glass to discolor.

to ALL re: HELP:  ZENITH 151

I recently wasa given an old Zenith 151 PC, and I'd like to make it
into a useful machine.  It has a memory card that it fully
populated with 64K chips, for a total of 256K.  Can I just replace
one or two banks with 256K chips?  Two banks replaced should
bring the machine too 640, but would it work?

It also has an odd monitor card -- there is a 9-pin connector on it, but
the monitor that came with it is using a phono jack.  Will  the 9-pin
give me monochrome output, or is it a game port of some kind?

Clearly, this critter came without any manuals, etc.  My plan is to
boost the memory, drop in a 40M hard disk, improve the monitor (if
possible) and have a useful writing machine.  I'm also planning to
make it honest (i.e., with DOS 5).

Has anyone had any experiences with this machine that might help in
the project?  Anything I ought to know about weirdness, e\?

Sorry about the messiness of this message; I always forget which
key to use for DEL (here it's backspace).

Hi Murray! No way do I disagree with you in theory or in the real world.
Though something else also happens in the real world too. I've seen CRTs
that just wouldn't work anymore using standard filament settings and I
gave them new life my tweaking up the filament voltage. I'd told the
customer that I'd expect the CRT to last 6 months or so, but if the
filament was weak, it could go out tomorrow. Odd enough some of those sets
are still working 15 years later. No... not all, but some of them are.
Another thing, CRT rejuvenators sometimes also adds many years on to a CRT.

I didn't know the cathode had barium! That's a bad metal to play around with.
If you touch barium, it will get absorbed into your skin and settle into
your liver. We are talking about the same thing, are we not?

Oh are you sure images burned in is X-RAY damage to the glass? Oh maybe
because now the glass has lead in it. I also haven't seen any recent image
burn in's either. Is this why? It use to be very common years ago.  Then
again the phosphor used to burn very easy too.

to BILL WOLFF re: R/CRT LIFETIMES

I didn't want to get to deep into the practice of cathode design, but you
brought up the point of increased heater voltage improving CRT performance.
If the cathodes are in a poisoning environment,i.e., the vacuum is not high
enough, the cathodes sometimes can be made to overcome the problem by running
them at a higher temperature.  Indeed it is the metal Barium that is the
active element used in most commercial cathodes.  Also x-rays are copiously
created  from electron bombardment on the masks.  Barium is used as getter
material to maintain the vacuum in CRTs.  The Barium ends up coating the
shadow mask in tube processing.  Barium will emit x-rays when bombarded by
electrons.  This is the primary source of CRT x-rays.  Glass discolors under
x-ray bombardment. The theory for the discoloring is the metal used in glasses
for various reasons change their chemical states when exposed to x-rays.  The
transformed state will change the color of the glass.  These are all highly
simplified explanations of a complex subject.
