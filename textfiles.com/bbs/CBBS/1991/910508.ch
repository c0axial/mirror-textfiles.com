to JAMES SCHMIDT re: R/WHO OWNS DOS?

  I guess I thought all DOSs were derivitive works off of MS, though
some things IBM did on its own.
  As to whether there will be a PC-DOS 5, that's interesting, since IBM
is pushing OS/2 so much - "what runs DOS better than DOS, Windows
better than Windows"? - and it seems it DOES - if you have enough memory.
  I think we'll just have to wait and see.

Msg 44730 is 06 line(s) on 05/07/91 from ED FOSTER
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/WINDOWS LOW-LEVEL PROGRAMMIN

  I have "Programming Windows" by Charles Petzold (Microsoft Press, 1990).
It is 944 pages long, and deals with lots of stuff like that, although I
did not see "writing device drivers" in quick look at the index.  The preface
mentions that to compile the examples you need the Windows Software Development
Kit and Microsoft C 6.0.  I also have a 4-disk set called "Supplementary
Driver Library".  If you'd like to look at any of this stuff let me know.

This looks like a disaster waiting for somewhere to happen.  Please let us
know after July 1 how it came out.

Msg 44732 is 06 line(s) on 05/07/91 from ED FOSTER
to TUVIA VINITSKY re: R/COMMUNICATIONS HELP!!

  I have had some problems occasionally with Carbon Copy and networks, but
most of the time they work fine.  You didn't mention what the remote sites
do when they call in.  (I assume the remotes run CCHELP and the machine
on the network runs CC.)  If they run a program, did the program change?
And do you have this trouble when you are just doing DOS commands and
listing directories?

In fact, ASC has open (Some time back) a location in Milwaukee,
and will open (This Summer) one out in Geneva, IL.

Msg 44734 is 04 line(s) on 05/07/91 from BEN BURCH
to BILL WOLFF re: R/DAMARK WARNING!!!

I have ordered a number of items from Damark, and have not had
any problems, either.  One can have a bad experience with ANY
vendor, I guess.  I should tell you about my experiences with
IBM some d~ray...
No msg 44735

Msg 44736 is 03 line(s) on 05/07/91 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to DAVID JOHNSON re: R/DISK COMPRESS

  That program looks  a lot better. I can compress the smaller
ones and probably run a TSR only when needed. There surely should
be somthing like this out there.

Msg 44737 is 11 line(s) on 05/08/91 from TUVIA VINITSKY
to ED FOSTER re: R/COMMUNICATIONS HELP!!

Yes, we have this problem just sitting at the prompt. Repeat, NO software
has been singly bumping. It is a random occurence between 1 and 60 minutes
into a call.

We returned the exact machine modem and hardware setup previously used,
(except for we did not restore the old network obviously) and it still
does this nonsense. I suspect line trouble, but Bell says it is OK.

Msg 44739 is 03 line(s) on 05/08/91 from JERRY HASLETT
to ALL re: REMOTE TERMINAL FOR PC

It is desired to connect a remote terminal to an XT Clone via
a twisted pair or an RS232 cable about 25 to 30 feet long.
Any suggestions?

Your name sounds familiar, have you ever worked at Rockwell

Msg 44741 is 22 line(s) on 05/08/91 from BILL WOLFF
to ALL re: FRAUDIGY PART 1

I know all of you have heard something like this before about
Prodigy, but it has come under attack again. It appears Prodigy has
the ability to scan your hard disk and then make copies of what it
considers useful information to a Prodigy data file called STAGE.DAT
for uploading to the Prodigy system. This is fueled by what people
have been finding within this file.

Now some have defended Prodigy and blamed that the Prodigy software
is so bad that it somehow goofs and extends the end of file to some
areas of the disk that was previously deleted by your DOS. So that is
why there are scraps of your data attached to that file. Even if the
program is that bad, Prodigy already admits that it uploads that file
to the system. So it is still getting your personal data whether the
programming is bad or not.

Now bare in mind, not all STAGE.DAT files are containing personal
data. It is my guess that once Prodigy uploads what it wants, it
deletes the data in the STAGE.DAT. Also note, STAGE.DAT normally
contains the most often used screen displays, so they can be accessed
by Prodigy to save telecommunications time and keep it low.

to ALL re: FRAUDIGY PART 2

Although I have not tested this yet, but it is said that if you take
a brand new Prodigy software package and install it on a brand new
floppy even though you have a hard disk as drive C:. It will pull
information off your hard disk and place it in the STAGE.DAT file
even before you log on for the very first time.

Someone who works on the inside of Prodigy as a columnist admitted
that Prodigy does pull information from your system and does so
legally because if you read your on-line agreement closely, it says
that you sign all rights to your computer and its contents to
Prodigy, IBM & Sears when you agree to the service. Well that is all
very interesting... wouldn't you agree? <BW>
