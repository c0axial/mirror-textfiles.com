I have an old Kaypro 16; when I installed DR DOS 5.0 I found the MODE
command wouldn't accept a MONO parameter!

I'm using PC-FIle 5.0, which uses a DBF file format.  I have one file
which is somehow damaged.  I can see all the records (some 350 or so) in
the program, but when I report only 182 come up.  I've run PC-File's
PCFIX program which (among other things) strips out any characters
below ASCII 32 (actually, replaces with a space), but the problem
persists.  Any suggestions for approaches to curing this ailment?

Like, is there a file editor around that's as easy to use as the
CP/M SuperZap?

Several .DBF fix utilities are around the various boards. SURGEON probably
will fix the problem. But your problem almost certainly involves a
corrupted header. Look for the hex equivalent for the *wrong* value you
found for .DBF with PMK, ZipZap or any similar disk editor and (on a
back-up copy, of course) try changing it to the hex value for the *right*
number of records. If the damage is more extensive (I suspect not), grab
a doc file on the .DBF file structure before editing. All of these
PD and shareware programs and docs are available on The Advocate and
elsewhere.

I have OS/2 running onn IBM PS/2 Model 80 for severl months now.
I have discovered i can not use my FASTBACKUP utility under OS/2,
nor can I run CHECKIT virus detection.. In talking to the computer
stores they just shrug their sholders or scratch their heads....
So, if their is anyone out there that knows of a utility package
I can purchase to allow me to backup my system, check for virus
plus some other basic utilities drop me a line on this BBS.
Thanks!!!!1

to ALL re: TOSHIBA 1340 PROGRAMING

I have owned a TOSHIBA P1340 for several years, and I am
a very satified customer as far as the printers performance.
The printer is a 24 pin DOT MATRIX letter quality printer.
The printer is capable of graphic modes.  I have only a
few qualms that I would like to inquire about.
My first complaint, is that in graphics mode the printer runs
like a model T ford.   I tried to save graphic files into
a print file on disk.  The files are saved to disk, but
require some kind of processing.  I am not quite sure what
is going on.  My second problem is that very few programs
will support my P1340.  EPSON & Hewlitt-Packard seem to
be the latest craze in printers.  I want to know if there
is a piece if software that will convert these bewteen
two different printers.  I think it can be done, but I
don't know if there are any products on the market that
will do such a trick.  I think it is possible, because
with the TOSHIBA it is possible to create a dot-to-dot
control of the print head.  All one would have to do
is convert from the different control characters that
are sent out to the printer, say from an EPSON mode
to a TOSHIBA mode.   Please leave any information about
this subject on the system to Edward Marsh.
                                  Thanks.
 P.S. Are there any P1340 owners that if had any
success trying to get their printers to work with
programs that didn't support P1340?  I tried to
print out TURBO TAX forms with little success.
No dup. chars.
