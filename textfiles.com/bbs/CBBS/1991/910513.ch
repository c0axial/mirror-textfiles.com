to ALLEN TURNER re: CBBS ACCOUNTS

  I have a 1000 user file accessed by a hashing algorithm, that scans 20
records after it lands on the hashed one.  If the name isn't found, it
overlays the oldest of the 20 it found.  As it is now, you should stay
around for about 4 months - for sure if you call monthly or every 2-3,
CBBS should still remember the hi msg # of your last call.  (such as to
get this msg - ;-)
  Tnx. for the kind words.

to ALL re: REMINDER:FULL LINE EDIT

  Lots of people don't realize that CBBS has a full "line" editor.  I can't
see how I could get along without it - I type fast, and when I make a
mistake I've often gone past it - with full line edit you can go back
quite readily, even inserting a char, or deleting one, etc.
  Type FULL? for help.  For some reason, FULL isn't in the help file,
or the help file index is fubar.
  Basically, if you just put "full" as part of your logon script, you
will be in wordstar full-line editing - and full? will show you what chars
do what (e.g. ^S=back, ^D=right, ^F=word right, ^G=del char, etc.)

to WARD re: THANKS

I recently read the article about this board in Boardwatch and wanted to
say that I had called back to where it all began!  And to say, "Thanks"
for all of the enjoyment that I have recieved by the work you folks have
started and continue to do.  I'm a Lutheran Pastor who uses the computer
like a fancy typewriter and file system (word processor and data base) and
the modem connects me to those who give me a hand via shareware and keep
my disposition better with recreational use - like "Global War" played on
several local boards.  Anyway, enough of the chat.  I'll go back and read
my log of the information at the first of this call.  Maybe I'll call back
again to enjoy the fruit of your labor.  Thanks, again.   TWH

The number I call for Gene's system is 708-843-8664, hope that helps.
I have the latest copy of "Stillwaters Chicago BBS list" on my BBS
at 708-991-3894, if that would help you replace any other local numbers.
I also have the latest national numbers if you call out of the area.
Search for "BBS" with the "FIND" command on my board, if you like.

to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/CIRCA 1980 IBM/#5217 PTR

  Leave me your particulars (address, telno, parts needed, etc),
and I will forward them to  someone who does this.
  I would give you her FAX number, but she telecommutes, and
I don't know if that would be acceptable to her for me to just
hand it out.
  If you don't wish others to see the address, etc., you may
leave them as comments when you go.

to ALL re: WORDSTAR NEEDED

If you have a legit copy of WordStar 4.0 with documentation for
cheap or reasonable, please leave a message here for me.  I might
be able to use two copies.

to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/DISK COMPRESS

No it doesn't.  The Round Table is very easy going.  You need to complete
the usual registration information, but that's it.  After you're validated,
(which is done usually quite quickly), there's no hassle.  And from what I
remember, the registrations no hassle either. (I've been on it for a
number of years, so don't quite remember the level of complexity of the
registration).  It is one of the more no-gimmicks boards.  Try it out.  If
you do get on and decide to stay, leave me a message.

Msg 44768 is 10 line(s) on 05/13/91 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/FRAUDIGY PART 1

From what I've read, data from the C drive appears in STAGE.DAT even
if STAGE.DAT is on another drive (such as a high-density floppy).
Doesn't quite sound right to me.  BTW, a while back there was an effort
to make Prodigy accessible to blind users (since it uses a graphics-mode
screen, ordinary screen-reading software can't figure it out).  Prodigy
was contacted and refused to give out details of their transmission
format (reason given was that they were afraid someone would figure
out how to bypass the ads).  I wonder if they were reluctant to give
out anything that would let people know exactly what kind of access
they have to your system.
No dup. chars.
