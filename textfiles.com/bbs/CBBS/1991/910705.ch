to ALA LUKE re: CBBS

  Please, as the bulletins say, don't call me "sysop" - I hate being treated
generically!  Also please use lower case!  CBBS automatically translated
your hard-to-read all-upper-case messages to lower case to make it easier
for others - but they'd be more readable if you used normal lower case with
upper case in the usual ways - EMPHASIS, etc.
  I don't know what you mean by "key commands on the screen".  Do you mean
the results of the ? command?  Most communications programs allow you to
capture to disk or print, so you can have a copy printed out and don't need
to look at it online.  I see you always enter things 40 columns wide - if
you are running some kind of a system that supports only 40 columns, then I
could see that you would have trouble - with EVERYTHING, and that isn't
CBBS's problem.  When CBBS was programmed in 1978, it handled 64 wide
columns as that was the standard of those days for microcomputer displays,
but soon went to 80 columns as more and more people got "real" CRTs for their
systems.
  Finally, as you'll note from most messages, there is no need to address
or sign your msgs, and the msg header does this very nicely for you.  Also
indenting an entire message does nothing.  I GUESS I can't complain it wastes
disk space as we have 5M free for msgs, but I just see no point in the
information-less spaces in front of each line.

Msg 44932 is 18 line(s) on 07/02/91 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALA LUKE re: CBBS

  Ooh, I forgot one thing: you commented on having to "scroll through
tons of screens before I can execute a command".  Do you know the standard
means of suspending and continuing output on remote systems: the use of
control-S to suspend, and control-Q to resume?  With this, you can pause
to see what is being given to you - apparently you don't or can't or
haven't read all the "tons of screens" which are, among other things,
telling you how to make use of CBBS.
  For example, when I log on, I am able to start entering a message with
about 6 lines or less of information coming from CBBS.  For example, after
you've seen the bulletin or welcome, you can ^K them - just as it says you
can.  Pressing control-K will abort out of what you're doing.  Once you've
entered your name, you should get right to the command menu.  Once you
become an expert user - i.e. have memorized the few commands you need,
you can run the "x" command to turn on the expert user flag which will
stop sending you long prompts.
  Also, you can separate multiple commands with ";" so for example you
can log on as: n;ala;luke;o;*    to log on, and request a one-line summary
of messages since your last call.

to BILL WOLFF re: R/POWER-OFF CONTROVERSY

   Hiya, Bill.  Well, I wouldn't worry about screen burn these days what
with all the screen savers (blankers) there are to choose from.  But what
I've noted about the situation is that leaving a set on most (if not all)
of the day every day is that the cathode emission gradually goes down,
and the cathode(s) develop a peculiarity such that they warm up VERY
slowly (sometimes hours! before a good picture).
   The rejuvenators are good, as you say, and they're just as dangerous
as you say they are.  Some are better than others, I've found.  A friend
owns a really good one, and his tech knows that machine better than anyone
else; I'm no slouch when it comes to that stuff, but when my CRT needs a
shot and Pete is available I have HIM do it.
   The small voltage on the filaments of some sets is a good thing; but
remember that with the set off, there's no cathode current, and it doesn't
seem to affect the warmup thing.

to MURRAY ARNOW re: R/CRT LIFETIMES

   I always thought of the getter as being the actual anode of a CRT,
and never thought of it as helping keep vacuum in the bottle.  Now that
I think of it, though, a metal deposition would certainly help hide the
porousness of the glass.  Interesting information one finds around here!

   Most interesting discussion!  I had always wondered about the discoloration
I see on so many old 25XP22 tubes (naturally, they're in VERY old sets!).

I have an IBM 84-key AT keyboard attached to my 386 clone.  To put it

to ALL re: HARD DISK WOES

  Well, it appears when it rains, it pours.
  Yesterday my Colorado Jumbo tape drive ate a tape, so my backup didn't
work.  I called Colorado, and 24 hrs later I've got a new drive in my
hands.  Unfortunately, my hard drive doesn't run now!  Spins, but
apparently the seek mechanism has given up the ghost.  It gets "non
system disk or disk error", meaning it is sitting on the boot track,
and can't seek past that.
  Fortunately, when the Colorado died, I networked to my other system,
and ran a backup tape to IT.  Tonight, it seems that tape is unreadable!
  Aaaargh.
  Time to figure out what drive to get - a 100M or so IDE - with 8-bit
controller.  (I'm still running an 8mhz Bullet motherboard in my PC
as a communications system).  The drive that died is a 2.5 year old
Priam half-height.

Msg 44938 is 06 line(s) on 07/03/91 from ED FOSTER
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/MODEM CONNECT

  I have also experienced this phenomenon of having to dial twice for one
connect.  I'm using a Prometheus 2400 internal, and I find that I must
recognize that it won't connect, break it myself, and redial after a few
seconds.  Occasionally that doesn't work either, and I have to cut back to
1200 or wait until the next day.
  By the way, an acquaintance of mine calls this the "ocean" sound.

Msg 44939 is 13 line(s) on 07/03/91 from ED FOSTER
to ALL re: CRT LIFETIMES

  I had to chuckle at the estimate of 5K or 10K hours of CRT life, because
I happened to be reading it on an 8-year-old monochrome monitor that has spent
most of its 8-year life turned on.  It is one of the original IBM PC monitors,
and I like it because its extremely slow phosphor (P39 as I recall) gives
almost no flicker.  They're not making these anymore, and I hate to see this
one go, so I use a screen saver with a 5-minute timer.
  "Slow" means that there is an after-image, so that the phosphor keeps glowing
even after the electron beam has been suppressed.  It makes the tube useless
with light pens (remember them?), and I suspect that it also makes the screen
vulnerable to permanent alteration by, perhaps, alteration to the molecular
structure.
  You rarely see burn-in on a color CRT, mainly because the phosphors are
faster and "harder", even though the electrons hitting them are moving faster.

Msg 44941 is 10 line(s) on 07/03/91 from MURRAY ARNOW
to ED FOSTER re: R/CRT LIFETIMES

I'm glad I gave you a chuckle.  The fact is the lifetimes quoted were average
lifetimes. The fact you have a tube that lasts longer is anecdotal.  Also it
is difficult to compare an old monitor performance to how it looked when it
was new.  You make all sorts of accomadations because you have a brightness
control and your memory of how it looked when new is impaired.  Your conjecture
about the phosphors has what sort of basis. I have seen screen damage on color
tubes.  The screen damage was actually the glass becoming discolored.  My
info isn't anecdotal.  I have a Ph.D. in physics and have been involved in
designing CRT's and measuring their lifetimes.  What I have been saying can
be substantiated.

to THOM QUICK re: R/ZENITH 151 HELP

Thanks for the info -- my machine has the video/floppy controller setup.
I'm hoping to find a controller card for floppies only, and replace the
current video with mono graphics.  As to memory expansion, yes, I think
a six-pak type setup would be best; that would give me clock space as well.

There is a PAL on the market that will make the memory card take 246K
chips, as well, and another that disables the CGA circuitry.  We sha;;
(shall) see how it goes.  One other thing I like about the machine --
unlike the IBM PC, which happily sucks air through every case opening
and shoots it out the back, the Zenith models seem to have pressurized
cases -- air flows OUT through openings.  Should help keep dust out!

Did I say floppy only controller?  I meant, of course, hard/floppy...
Thanks again for the help!

to ALL re: HARD DRIVE WOES

  Well, fixed my problems - a ST1144, 124M, and an 8-bit controller.  Being
my first IDE drive, it was kind of a "thrill" and yet a "letdown" - you just
plug the drive in, and "poof" it is there, FDISK sees it, etc.
  Nice and fast, too - probably TOO fast for my little 8mhz 640K commo
PC.  Partitioned it to match the Jumbo tape drive - I'm conservative,
still on DOS 3.3.

Chinet was down 1 July for 5 hours suffering from heat prostration.
Apparently had a relapse today.  Should be back up later today.
