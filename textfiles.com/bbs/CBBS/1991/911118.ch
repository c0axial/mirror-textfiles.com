I can't recall now if I mentioned Elseware?  How about Equal Partners?  There
are probably a zillion other shareware products out there by now, since
the commercial stuff has smacked SO badly.  Keep your (be seeing you)
Eyes peeled.  Let me know how it goes with TR3-9, eh?

The practice I follow here is to dump TWO CMOS screens--the one from
which the set-up data are entered and one that displays at boot time.
It will vary from system to system, but the items which are displayed
aren't identical on my machine. The first of the screens, for example,
shows my (wierd!) settings for HD type, while the second doesn't. On
the other hand, my second screen shows details about installed RAM,
which doesn't appear on the first. (RAM set-up is accomplished through
an XCMOS routine.) . . . Yeah, I too keep a little set of data similar
to your book. And for each of my clients, I maintain a printout of CMOS,
AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS and tree structure. Handy, of course, to
refresh memory (human and computer!) after a variety of minor disasters.

Well, the worry about the fan is exactly that whatever dreck is out
there gets pulled all over the boards; but you're right, since the
PC doesn't have filter, it probably makes little difference.
 I agree on the BIOS up to a point -- the point of a crash, at
which point you can't get the machine back up.  But I haven't much
experience with these critters.
 The door IS a good idea.  But I've seen those on many 3.5" drives --
it ain't nothing new.  What WOULD be a good idea would be to put some
additional power-switching outlets on the back
of the box.  You could have everything switch at once.  Ofcourse
that would put the 'control center' folk out of business...

There are some types of computers that doesn't even have any fans.
Personally, those are the ones I go for. I shy away from hard drives
for the same reason as fans. They brake down too often and then you
have all kinds of problems. If a computer can't operate without a fan,
then I feel that some components are running too hot as it is. Why
fix it with a fan?
  Hard drives are the weakest links to todays computers. They make lots
of noise and are only 4 times faster than fast floppies in general.
Though they cost more than 4 times more. No deal there... though
RAM drives can be 1000 times faster and only a little more in cost
without the noise. I know this isn't mainstream, though I have kept
very happy this way with a bare minimal cost to compute AND NO NOISE!
