to ALL re: SO YOU THINK PRODIGY IS SLOW?

I had the opportunity to install a communication package that accesses
a relatively new service called 'America Online' You may be getting or
have already received an offer to trial the service for free.
Well let me tell you, I you are a DOS 5.0 user it flat out won't run
until you to a SETVER to something less that 5.0 and if you have a
hard drive partitioned to greater than 32 Mb you must use 4.0x.
Once installed it executes in the same GUI that PC GEOS uses.
It is as slow as or slower than Prodigy (2400 baud max). The initial
sign on procedure takes about 15 minutes (it askes a dozen questions
and asks the usual credit card/ billing address stuff).
Once in the service you CAN do file downloads but based on my stop
watch estimates I would guess they are about 25% efficient. YUCK.
Based on this you are really paying 4x the $4.00 offprime connect time
or about $16 per hour.
I'll stick with CIS.

to BARGAIN HUNTERS re: MOTHERBOARDS FOR SALE

Hi! I have several motherboards and other parts that I am trying to sell.
I also have a CD ROM player, a few IDE hard drives, lotsa VGA cards and
even a whole computer. oh yeah, did I mntion Ethernet cards?
 Anyway, If you are interested in something, call American ARCHIVE BBS,
which I check for messages daily. leave mail for SYSOP there.
 Anything I do not sell by next weekend *Aug 17* I will take to the annual
CACHE fest at DeVry (Its still the third Sunday in August, right?)
 So I do not want to clog up this BBS with all the details, so call my board
and read all about it. but act fast! It all goes at the CACHE FEST!

to BENJAMIN COHEN re: R/DR DOS OR MS DOS

you can also install DR-DOS on any partition on a hard disk. MS-DOS will
only install on the first. Very handy if you have a disk with something
else at the start if it.
