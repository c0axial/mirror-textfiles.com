Msg 44975 is 17 line(s) on 07/11/91 from MICHAEL SHARTIAG
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/HARD DRIVE WOES

Ward,
  My understanding of the IDE drive is they basically  built the controller
onto the drive.  THis gets somwhat complicated by the use of MFM, RLL and
other varoius schemes for recording (Zone recording), but it is all
transparent sst the IDE connector.  The drives also convert from whatever
they actually run in (as far as physical layouts) to a standard 17sector/
xx heads yy cylinders through their own onboard mapping routines.
    The IDE interface card is simply a parallel paddle card with a
little bit of electronics to allow it to be I/O mapped and have a
slection of addresses.  They do not have BIOS on them, which is why
they can't be used in XT machines.  They were designed to be used with
CMOS setup type machines only.
   I guess someone could have designed a card that is 8 bits, and has
a BIOS on it, but this sounds more like a converter interface than an
IDE card (while the end result is the same)  I'll check the local
compUSA by me.  For some applications it could be interesting.
It would at least open up the larger drive sizes to the XT machines.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/3270 FILE TRANSFER

the think that interests me is the way the file transfer is accomplished
without stepping on the 3270 data stream codes.  The killer would be the
SBA - start buffer address - I don't think the buffer on the emulation
board would see that code....
So, they have to be using some form of magic - like with ind$file -
can only do 2 for 1 or remap chars or something - especially the binary
files.
You were at ryerson - the steel folks - hmmm - I know some folks down
there - but they did quite a few shuffles last year.

It is now time for me to upgrade from DOS 4.01 to the next OS.
Apparently there are two OS's to look at. The first is Dr. Dos
5.0 and the second is MS DOS 5.0. Has anyone h{d eerience
suggesting a perference between either OS? Thanks...

I  have a Texas Instruments Professional computer that I would be willing
to give to anyone who (1st) knows what it is and (2nd) can find a use for
it.  All I have for it in the way of Dos is ver. 2.11 with an emulation
program to make it quasi IBM compatible.
If you want it, give me a call at 830-4222 anytime after 10:00am 7 days

Yes the primary format is a true low level format, but don't use it.
Seagate told me that if I really wanted to re-low level format the drive
they would send me a program to do it, and not to use that one under debug
I have all the specs available for Seagate drive, so if you need one, give
me a call and I can mail or fax you a copy.

How much memory does it have and how many drives does it contain?

Msg 44984 is 24 line(s) on 07/13/91 from JIM POLOUS
to RICHARD HINTON re: DR DOS OR MS DOS

I originally purchased DR-DOS 5.0 shortly after it became available. It
seemed to fit all of my needs at the time. There was a bug in the TYPE
function that caused some headaches for me doing some programming (I don't
remember it exactly, something with CRs and LFs. ) It is very compatible,
reporting to all applications that it was DOS 3.31  It allowed me to
use the NET3 Novell shell. It costs $99.99.  MS-DOS 5.0, reports 5.0
for the version, but it has a neat SETVER command for those applications
that won't run on odd DOS versions (I have it reporting Version 9.99 for
PC Tools. It doesn't seem to mind). My Bernoulli box driver was not
compatible with MSDOS 5, I had to get an upgrade of that. There appear
to be better memory management features in MS-DOS 5.0, you can unload MSDOS
and install your old DOS in its place. The DR-DOS full screen editor is
Wordstart command based (Ctrl-K, Ctrl-Y to delete a line, etc). MS-DOS
editor is like their programming languages (QBASIC, QC). MSDOS includes
edlin as well as its editor. MS-DOS includes a QBASIC interpreter, DRDOS
does not. There are other slight differences.... DRDOS's debug is called
SID. Both include a GUI-Like shell... DRDOS's VIEWMAX and MS-DOS's
DOSSHELL. I don't use them so I can't comment on them. MS-DOS has some
features from Central Point Software.. ie, MIRROR and the ability to
UNFORMAT a disk. The FORMAT command merely clears the FAT table and
verifies the disk, and saves the old FAT table. If you need to unformat the
disk, it just rewrites the FAT. MS-DOS upgrades are only $40 at Egghead.
DR-DOS will set you back $80-$150 depending where you get it.
Hope this helps. Jim

Thanks for the offer....I just received a carte blanche OK to use a (limited)
expense account for whatever seems appropriate from the editor. Depending
upon responses to FAXes and some air mail queries I've sent out (a total
of about 3 dozen in 20+ countries), I may want to pursue CIS for supplemental
sources. Do you happen to know if forums exist for areas OTHER than Europe?
At the moment, I've found at least some leads on 5 continents, but would
like more depth in some parts of the world. Western Europe is fairly
well covered at the moment--subject to how responsive the sources are.
(Just received my first reply--from England--today.) Thanks again.
No dup. chars.
