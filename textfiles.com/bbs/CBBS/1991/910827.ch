  Sure, no problem.  There's even a possibility I may be roped into
being there - IBM is apparently doing something, though not sure - our
internal workstation special interest group was talking about it.
  As to problems uploading msgs, I don't know what the problem could
be - I'm preparing this msg offline for uploading, assuming I'll have
no problems.  Just put a slight character delay in, and wait for the
question-mark as a prompt char before uploading the next line (or
wait for a line-feed, and put a fraction of a second delay after that
- all this has worked fine for me.
  Hope you don't have any "centering", ****'s, or other things in the
note.  That's the one thing (other than inappropriate subjects) I
don't like to see - wastes space and time and contains no information.
  ;-)
  -- Yep, I'm now on-line - the above looks just fine.  Perhaps you had
data just coming in too fast, or you had blank lines that kicked back to
the editor, then mis-interpreted your next line as commands.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: YOUR 486 & OS/2

Ward,
   I'm SERIOUSLY considering obtaining a 486 based system. I know you
recently  purchased such a unit. Would you mind telling me what your
configuration looks like? eg. Secondary cache, video, memory, dasd etc.
Also, have you dabbled into OS/2 as yet? What are the possibilities
of running OS/2 on non-IBM systems?
Thanks,
James

to WARD re: UMBS AND OTHER CRITTERS

I'm wondering...if PMAP doesn't work with DOS5...how the heck can I
check to see if all those wonderful drivers got loaded high like I
told DOS to do it?  Seems that with 2 MB on the Mod. 80, there should
not be a problem with it, but I don't see any increase in available
memory.

Ideas?
No dup. chars.
