to ALL re: WILL SCSI'S FIGHT?

I keep hearing horror stories about IDE drives that fight with
one another, or an IDE that fights with an RLL. But I wonder
that since SCSI's don't even use the 386 BIOS for example, they
shouldn't fight with anyone--is that true?

Msg 45167 is 14 line(s) on 10/15/91 from BOB SULLIVAN
to ALL re: SUB LIBR SYSTEM BACKWARD STEP

Some of you may be familiar with SWAN.  The Suburban Library System: System
Wide Automated Network.  For the past couple of years this has allowed home
computer users to call up and do various searches of the 850,000 titles in
the suburban system.  A good BBS type access to knowledge.
  Last Friday I attempted to look for books on stepper motors and found that
I could not access the system.  When I first called the library, no one knew
what the problem was exactly.  After several phone calls my local library
and I now know that the computer was changed to work with VT-100 terminals
only.  I tried to explain that this locked out users such as myself, yet many
systems allow a choice of terminal interface.  I received a kind but
patronizing response.  This is a big step backwards for information seekers
without the money to buy VT-100 or emulation programs.  While not as
spectacular as the Thomas-Hill hearings, access to information is important.
Any suggestions?
