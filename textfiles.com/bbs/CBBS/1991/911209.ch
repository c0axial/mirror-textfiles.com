to ALL re: GENUS TOOLS WANTED

  Anyone selling GENUS's toolkits? I will order 2 but would buy 3
used (transferable)... GX Graphics, Effects. Text. I love the PCX
Toolkit (fast and easy multi language kit).

Msg 45319 is 11 line(s) on 12/08/91 from MICHAEL SHARTIAG
to WARD/ALL re: MONITOR CONT.

I have reviewed my super VGA card manual and found the following:
MDA = 18.4KHz  Horizontal
CGA = 15.75KHz
EGA = 21.85KHz
VGA = 31.5KHZ for standard modes
VGA interlaced at 35.5KHz for Super VGA
VGA non-interlaced at 49.8Khz......
If these are indeed correct, what can I do with an interlaced monitor
with Horizontal at 33.5Khz +/- 500 Hz??  Can the clock on the monitor
be slowed down by a percentage to get to a PC standard of 31.5 or
optionally speed up to get to the 35.5 level ??

Msg 45320 is 08 line(s) on 12/08/91 from BILL WOLFF
to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/MONITOR CONT.

I would think that monitor could adjust that far. Look for a horiz
control, e.i. television. Though this may not be your problem, though
one can't usually adjust the horizontal freq much on many non-multi-
sync monitors far because the circuit is freq matched to the rated
freq. If you wanted to change it one would need to recal the pin
cusion amp, maybe change the flyback, yoke, and a few tuned circuits.

Then again, I never got a CGA monitor to work at MGA speeds!

Msg 45321 is 20 line(s) on 12/08/91 from JIM POLOUS
to RICHARD HINTING re: HARD DISKS

In my experience, Seagate drives are better than some hard disks I have
encountered. I had one running a BBS for a while and it's 6 years old.
Due to other hardware problems, I am no longer running the board, but
If I fired up that drive, it would work flawlessly! At work, we have
a couple dozen old Miniscribe 10 and 20 mb drives. These too function
well, despite their age (6-7) years. None of these drives that I'm
talking about are really speedy (Seagates @ 65ms, Miniscribes at 100ms), but
they STILL work. On the otherhand, we've had a rash of Conner Peripherals
drives die (3 in laptops, 2 in PCs). The 2 in PCs were under warranty,
so we were able to replace them..(with Seagate IDE drives!). These
Conner drives were all 20Mb, the Conner 40 mb drives are fine.
In my opinion Maxtor/Storage Dimensions, Imprimis/Seagate/Wren and
Miniscribe drives are all excellent - I'd watch for drives from a company
called LaPine. I had one once and it was nothing but trouble. I think
the company went out of business anyway, but there still may be a few
around.  For the heck of it, I'll tell you what I paid for that Seagate
over 6 years ago... $589.00 - ST-225!

to BILL MATTSON re: R/HP DESKJET 500 INKJET PRINTE

Bill I've also been looking at the 500C. You can get a black only
cartridge. I ran their demo on 10, 20, 40, and 70 lb bond paper.
All typing and color graphs came out looking G R E A T. I need to
try some transparencies and envelopes yet. I do not know what the
optional epson/proprinter III emulation cartridge costs!

Looking for someone who has a dead Seagate 1144A that had a head crash.
If you have one or know someone who has one, please leave a message
hear.

to AL HIGGINS re: R/HP DESKJET 500 INKJET PRINTE

Thanks for the input, as you may have gathered from some of my traffic
with Ward, I'm not very well informed in page-printing, desk-top
publishing, fonts, etc. This looks like a great machine. B/W or color,
but I'm kind of lost on all the peripheral stuff (no pun intended)
being basically an old Epson MX100 man who spent some money on a
Toshiba P321, now broken.

Msg 45327 is 13 line(s) on 12/09/91 from BYRON GRUSH
to ALL re: DEC RAINBOW WOES

I have acquired a Dec Rainbow 100 with two floppies
and about 384K memory. This runs CPM and can run DOS.
The drives are pretty funky. Are there people out there
that still use these things? If so, I would be interested
in either, upgrading this so that it is useful, or
trading it to someone who could use it. It works. It
has a bunch of software (word processor, spreedsheet,
communications package, etc.) My problem is in trying to
get the serial port to talk to my DOS machine so I can
do file transfers, etc. I'd be interested in a drive
transplant or hard drive addition. This has color (16)
and a nice monitor. Let me know if anyone has any interest
in this wonderful antique.

Msg 45328 is 15 line(s) on 12/09/91 from MARTY DIPPEL
to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/TONY'S BOARD

Thanks, Andy.  I'll have to check into SIMTEL somehow soon.  I've
seen listings of SOME of the available archives, and it looks just huge.
Tony Antonucci has very graciously uploaded MicroEMACS3.11 to his board
for me (and others, though I wonder sometimes...).  I've downloaded it
and it works just GREAT.  Many improvements since V3.9.  I see by the
docs he's got MicroSPELL V2.0 available as well.  I'll have to see if
I can pull that one down from SIMTEL.  I've got SPELL V1.0 and it's
just fair.  Can't wait to see any improvements.  If they're anywhere
near the magnitude of the improvements to MicroEMACS, I'll be more
than pleased.

I can't understand why more people aren't interested in MicroEMACS.
It's about the best programming editor I've seen for cheap; MUCH better
than vi (at the risk of an editor war here) and without being the
system resource hog that GNU EMACS is.  Thanks again.

Msg 45329 is 13 line(s) on 12/09/91 from AL HIGGINS
to BILL MATTSON re: R/HP DESKJET 500 INKJET PRINTE

Understand..... I've talked to several people at ET and it's really
amazing the different stastics you get out of them. It's apparent none
of them really know how a 500C works! They can't even speak intelligently
based upon what HP puts in their product announcement. After those encounters
I took my material over to ET and ran it thru the demo program. We were
even able to talk them into hooking one up to a PC. The down side was
the PC didn't have HG on it so I wasn't able to print out MY Charts that I
print out on a LQ2550 at work. The next test is to print out Color
transparities and see how they look! If they look good, I'll purchase one.\
That will mean I'll be the only one in the office that can do COLOR overheads.
As the company will not pay the $8-11 per transparity... Besides, I don't
know who is going to have more fun with it, ME or my three kids!!!!!
Will let you know how the transparities come out.....
No dup. chars.
