to ALL re: LINE NOISE?

  I'm having the worst line noise I've ever had - been going on for
a couple months.  If I don't go MNP I cant' talk to CBBS at all - but
at times it is better - so perhaps it is a specific trunk line between
Chicago and Dolton, and sometimes the luck of the draw sez it get it,
other times, not.
  Thanks!

Hi Ward, this is Dan from Patri-Soft.  I was hoping to be able to upload
the latest and greatest STOWAWAY to your BBS, but it doesn't look like
you take uploads.  (Of course, I understand, what with a 20 meg drive and al
all.    Oh well, I guess I'll just use U.Snail then.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/ORGANIZING HARD DISK

One option would be to  set the partition 80/80 or 100/60 and use the second
partition as a miror backup of the first. The only problem you run into
is if you loose the drive you've lost everything!!!!!
I recently lost a Segate 1144A, controller went up in smoke! As I keep
all my data on 3 1/2" disks I didn't loose anything other than three
days of loading software and RESETTING all my favorite settings......
Remeber back in 1977 when we had 10MB drives and couldn't find enough
software to put on them!!

to MURRAY ARNOW re: R/STATIC

We found we had a problem in the office with static. It seemed some
people generated more static than others. Actually it was the clothes
they were wearing.... One secretary could just turn around on move in
her chair and she would ZAP things. She transfered to another department
and we solved our problem.
No dup. chars.
