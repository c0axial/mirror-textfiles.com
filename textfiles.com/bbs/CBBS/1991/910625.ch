  I don't think all those "set back" thermostats are a sham - thus I think
it IS appropriate to set back air conditioning when a location is not
occupied.  Lets take the worst case of a house unoccupied for a month's
vacation.  Surely the AC shouldn't be left on 78 degrees all that time.  It
won't cost THAT much - perhaps 4 hours operation - to bring the house to
76 degrees after the people come back.  At the other extreme is the
idea of leaving the AC on full time.  That would be most expensive.  I'm
sure there is some formula for determining the optimum - for example "don't
go more than 8 degrees high" or something.

  Great!  I just bought another AE2 yesterday @ CompUSA - the Novell
School I'm in has me thinking of putting up a Novell server, and I
would use the same board so I could be compatible across the board -
in case I decide to make it a Lantastic Server instead.

  Here's what a 720K disk looks like:
DiskParm 9/10/88 by Ward Christensen
        Defaults to A: drive, or specify a drive:  DiskParm c:
00 02 02 01 00 02 70 00 A0 05 F9 03 00 09 00 02 00 00 00
~~~~~ ~~ ~~~~~ ~~ ~~~~~ ~~~~~ ~~ ~~~~~ ~~~~~ ~~~~~ ~~~~~
  512 bytes per sector
    2 sectors per cluster
    1 reserved sector
    2 copies of fat
  112 root entries
 1440 sectors per disk
   F9 media descriptor
    3 sectors per fat
    9 sectors per track
    2 heads
    0 hidden sectors
  ----
  So, no a 720K isn't 512 byte clusters - it is 1K.
  720K floppies could even be patched to use 512 byte clusters, but
you'd have to increase each fat's size, move the root dir down, etc.
  Major process, but I've done it as an exercise.

  A light bulb doesn't fail due to the start-up spike.  It fails during
start-up due to thermal shock - going from room temp to thousands of
degrees.  Nevertheless this same cold-to-hot transition, to a lesser
degree, obviously applies to electronics.

Msg 44891 is 10 line(s) on 06/23/91 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: HOW A PC BOOTS

  I'd been asking (not here) how a PC boots, and found the following, by
pointers to the MS-DOS encyclopedia.
  What happens is that the rom goes to the master boot sector (MBS) of
the drive, and looks for the following:
  - can read it (obviously - if it can't read it it hasn't been LLF'd)
  - finds a long or short JMP in byte 0
  - finds a 55 AA at the end of the sector
...THEN it loads that code into 0:600 (I think) and executes it.  It moves
itself up, sets up pointers to the partition, and then loads the boot
sector from DOS or what ever is set up to boot.  It loads up at 0:600 also.

Msg 44892 is 06 line(s) on 06/23/91 from CLIFF SHARP
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/HOW A PC BOOTS

   Good description, except that the code I've looked at executes at
0:700.  The partition sector (C0H0S1) on a hard drive is an executable
code fragment which finds the active partition's first sector, loads IT
and executes it to complete the beginning of the boot sequence.  It
can be very instructional to disassemble C0H0S1 on a standard, FDISKed
hard drive to see that part in gory detail.

Ahh... your right about thermal shock to a light bulb, but it also
does gets spiked as well. Light bulbs when cold hardly offer little
resistance to electrons. On the other hand, when they are heated to
high temperatures with the combo of mass current flow, starts to
oppose current flow and builds up lot more resistance.

On a different note, filaments in tubes, which act very much like
light bulbs, would usually blow (if connected in series) either the
one in the path of an incoming electrons or the one rated at the
highest voltage drop. Knowing this little trick while repairing
tube TV sets with series connected filaments which had one or more
filaments gone proved very helpful.

In short, yes you are correct in what you are saying, but there
are also mass surge that builds up through a filament when you first
turn it on or shall I say whenever you turn it on.

Ah... that old MS-DOS bug got me again. I had a open file on drive B:
and swapped the data disk with a freshly formatted disk. I forgot that
there was an opened file on the other disk and placed the old data
disk back into the drive and then read the directory and wham! The old
directory is now replace with the formatted disk with no files. OH
NO!!!

I recovered some files with RECOVER and CHKDSK MS-DOS commands, but
those that were much older than a few days were all gone. Why oh why
does this bug still exist while many never warn you of this. Ouch!

  I ran into the old "change the disk with open files" 3-5 times at work-
I used to say I would rebuild the disks for 'em - but after about 5 hrs
hacking, I decided it wasn't worth it - better to teach 'em "don't do it!".
  When DOS 4 came out, and showed this funky serial #, I said "Yay!  At

   Everyone seems to be talking about whether to leave power on the computer
or turn the whole thing off when leaving it.  To cover the monitor, let me
say that the monitor should be shut off any time you're not going to be
using it for the next fifteen minutes.
   I spent the better part of the period 1967 to 1978 repairing TV sets,
and found that sets left on all the time developed a peculiar weakness of
the CRT; it would be fine once on for a while, but when turned off and hten
on, it would take nearly forever to "warm up" to the point that it had even
a viewable picture (much less a good one).
   How does this experience carry over?  Take a TV, gut it (remove the tuner,
the IF stages, the video detector, the chroma stages, etc. etc.) and you
basically have a monitor.  The Princeton HX-12 I'm using today was a
throwaway from a company that was told the CRT was bad; I soldered an
intermittent joint on a CRT driver transistor and it hasn't performed in
any less-than-perfect manner since.
   The debate is open on leaving the computer on (I leave mine on 24 hrs.)
but the monitor should be turned OFF whenever you plan not to use the 'puter
in the next fifteen minutes (about the amount of life the CRT loses when
you turn it on).

Msg 44900 is 30 line(s) on 06/25/91 from BILL WOLFF
to CLIFF SHARP re: R/POWER-OFF CONTROVERSY

Hi Cliff! Well I understand what your saying but many improvements have
been made since the 60's and 70's. There used to be a claim that leaving
CRT's on all the time with the same screen causes the image to be burned
into the screen. Since then, the screens can take lots more heat then the
older types. So this would hardly be a problem today. I have yet heard of a
case that this has happened with any CRT later than say 1980. Of course,
you can if you turn the bias higher than average viewing.

Another thing you have to worry about is the heater (filament) in the CRT.
If that goes (you have three filaments on a color CRT) you'll be out of
business (if color, you're out a color). Turning it on and off will weaken
the filament(s). Also leaving it on, will also weaken it. There is no
winning here, just balance.

I do still have a CRT rejuvenator that works wonders in some cases. It
won't fix broken filaments, but it will help getting a brighter picture.
Though this trick does weaken the filaments and can blow them during the
event. Darn if you do and darn if you don't.

Another thing helpful (or harmful depending how you look at it) is that
most CRT's now have a small voltage applied to the heater all the time.
This speeds up warming up a CRT and lessens the quick temperature changes
that a CRT has to go through. On the other hand, it's on all the time even
though on a lower setting sometimes.

By the way, I too, turn off my monitors if I won't be using them in about
15 minutes or so. I also turn off my computers most of the time too. Though
I don't have hard drives. If I did, I would likely leave mine on more. I
don't really dislike hard drives, it's just the computers I use would be
very expansive to add one.
No dup. chars.
