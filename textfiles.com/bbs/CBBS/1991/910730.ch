IDE is magic.  It seems the drive layout doesn't matter too much!  They
use an RLL ZBR recording technique - Zone Bit Recording - that means that
like Mac floppies, different tracks have different # of sectors.  Thus
the physical drive characteristics you give it DO NOT MATTER except they
have to match the MAX size.  At least I've heard this said by people
over and over.
  I just bought an ST1144A with a hokey XT controller (it actually is a
16-bit drive, but apparently this controller TRANSLATES to 16 bits!).
I like the drive - quiet, fast.

  Soon as I have enough extra for a printer it is job change time! Maybe
just an omen to wait a while yet.
No dup. chars.
