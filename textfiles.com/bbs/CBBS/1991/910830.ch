  No, I thought about it (message threads) and designed it, but never
implemented it.  CBBS is basically a piece of history - how it was 10
years ago.  So just like a ride in a model T, it wouldn't be the same
with an automatic transmission.
  HOWEVER, suppose the subject is "club meeting", you can do a summary
s<CR> then 1,club meeting<CR> or s;1,club meeting, in which case each
of the first 9 msgs found will be "marked" for retrieval (not retrEIval
as I see you spelled it when looking in the HELP file), as #1, etc.
  Thus: r;#1  r;#3, etc.  Kind of a kludge.
  Actually the most expert way to do it is: or;1,club meeting
which says (O)ne line summary, with (R)etrieval, from message 1, about
club meeting ;-)
