Nice to see that this little gold gem remains, etched in time, a tribute

to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/FAT TABLES /REBUILDING

  You're into real "hacking" territory if your FAT is gone.
  First thing I'd do is get good with Norton Utility.  If the drive were mine,
I'd first check if the boot sector reflects the drive properly - i.e.
number of clusters, etc.  I have a program that can do that - or you can
do it with Norton Utility - well, sort of do it - you can look at the boot
sector and see if it "looks right" (one of those "I know, but I can't
explain it" problems).
  If THAT is correct, then I'd see how much of the FAT is still good -
either FAT 1 or FAT 2.  If NONE of it is any good, I'd zero it.
  Then, I'd decide which of the files were most important - i.e. worth the
effort to try to bring back.
  I'd then try to locate the directory entries for those files with NU -
I think it can change directories, even if the FAT doesn't agree that
there's a file there.
  I'd patch the directories back into existance - by putting an "<EOF>"
entry in the FAT for each.  If it looked like a DIR went past one cluster,
I'd try to find that cluster, and make the fat chain properly.
  Then I'd find the file, and I'd use the unerase utility to bring the file
back, manually-selected-cluster by manually-selected-cluster.
  NOTE you might have to put an E5 in the first byte of the filename to
be able to use unerase.
  The reason I'd use unerase is because it has a utility to view sectors,
and add them to a chain of clusters, and rebuild the fat from that info -
cluster by cluster, and file by file.
  VERY tedious work.  I once zapped about 100 FAT pointers (wrote
some garbage over 'em) and it took about 100 hours to reconstruct a few
of the files.  BUT I sure learned about FATs (I had no NU at the time -
wrote some of my own utilities, such as to dump hard-to-read 12-bit fats).

Thank you for coming up with a wonderful idea!  I've been running a BBS here
in Olympia for 8 years now.  I just wanted to drop by and pay homage to
GOD, as it were.  Thanks again.
