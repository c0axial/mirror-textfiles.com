to BOB SULLIVAN re: R/PRINTER QUESTION

  My 2nd printer - a Gemini - had problems with some of the wires.
You should probably not try to take the head apart - I found it could
take hours to try to get all the wires back in place, as well as rather
exotic gluing techniques to hold things together.
  It DOES sound like a print head problem.  Do you have any graphics
applications that you could use to check it out?
  You might also try putting some cleaner (isopropyl alcohol?) on the
head wires...
  Also check the "plug" or how ever the head plugs in - could be bad.
  Of course, other things could be wrong - such as electronics - a blown
transistor, etc.

to ALL re: MICROEMACS V3.11 SOURCE

I'm looking for the distribution for the latest version of MicroEMACS,
that being version 3.11.  I know I can obtain source via anonymous FTP
to Daniel Lawrence (wherever he is, easily enough obtained) but thought
one of the boards here in the area might have it on line.  Anybody
know which one for sure?  I've been calling all kinds of 'em today,
and at this rate, it'll soon be cheaper to fly Dan Lawrence over here
and exchange the stuff in person over dinner.  I've got V3.9 here and
have been using it for years; time to upgrade.  Any help is appreciated.
Thanks.
