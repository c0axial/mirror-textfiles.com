I installed FAST! as a device driver on a model 60 with no other disk caching.
When I ran Norton's speed index, it indicated that the disk index speed had
increased, and the overall speed of the PC had gone from 7 times to 9 times as
fast as an XT.

However, none of the programs are executing faster.  I timed the loading of a
compiled spreadsheet -it still took 6 minutes.  I tried loading it a second
time, thinking it was a caching utility, and the next time would be faster;
but their was not increase in execution.  WordPerfect still takes the same
amount of time to load and the disappointed users can see no difference
in performance.

Has anyone else had this problem, or do they have any suggestions?  I
installed the EXE file for a PS/2 type machine, and I am not using
Fastopen.  I left a message at the company, but they have not yet
returned my call.

Hi Martin! I disagree and believe there are uses for online services. I use
CompuServe, GEnie, Q-Link, and sometimes Prodigy (usually to verify con
reports). I also used The Source before they went under. I continue to
subscribe to them because they offer bare minimum cost verses high long
distance phone charges. I can usually EMAIL a friend a thousand miles or
more for a few pennies verses using another method which is more costly. I
also like online services for the news and latest computer news info. It's
also a good place to share ideas and helpful tips. They usually attract
software authors so you can also chat with them directly. Again, without
expensive long distance charges. Another thing nice about online services
is multi nodes and minimum down time. This is what paying a little extra
can provide which saves tons of time.

One little neat feature of online services that I latched on to, was Q-Link
offered a deal of one payment of $169 for a lifetime membership. This meant
you pay $169 once and no charge for basic services which normally run $9.95
per month. Well... years have past since the offer back in November 1988
and if I had to do it again... I surely would jump on another offer like
this again. True this is a Commodore only services (with some MS-DOS and
CP/M) and you need a Commodore with special software to log on with, well
now it's basically free for me and still faster than Prodigy at 2400 baud
vs. Q-Link's maximum speed of 1200 baud and Q-Link still uses graphics. I
wish other services would offer a deal like this as well. Although I doubt
if another deal would ever pop up like this again. It was perhaps... truly
once in a lifetime deal.

to MARILYN LITT re: FAST! NOT THE PROBLEM

Disk cacheing software (including, I suspect, FAST!) operate by allow
fast RE-reads of disk sectors.  When you're loading a long file, there
are no re-reads, and hence the cache presents no advantage.  For faster
loading of programs, there are at least two strategies you can use:
1)  Make sure that your hard disk is "defragmented"; that is, that each of
the files on your hard disk occupies  a single contiguous area on the
drive.  Otherwise, the disk spends most of its loading time skipping from
track to track looking for the pieces of the program.  2)  Create a
RAM disk in the computer's extended memory, and load the most commonly
used and/or longest programs onto that disk at boot-up time.  Then place
that drive's root directory at the head of the PATH parameter in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
  Someone else here may have other suggestions, and may be able to tell
you if FASTOPEN would also be of benefit.

to MARILYN LITT re: R/FAST! NOT WORKING

  As an adjunct to Roy Lipscomb's reply to you on this (45064),
I'd further suggest that if/when you do run a de-fragmenter, you
pick one that let's you put INDIVIDUAL files where you want them.
  I.e. say you are running a program that takes overlay files
that are frequently accessed.  Now, normally you'd think that you'd
wish to put the executable FIRST, but in this case, that would not
be a good strategy; the executable gets loaded once, but the overlays
are seing sought often, so it makes more sense for them to be first
on the disk.
  If you've not ever USED a de-fragmenter, and have say Norton,
disable your cache program first (MOST IMPORTANT!!!), then run the
de-fragmenter.
  Usually, slow load times are invariably because of fragmentation,
and trying to say, sort a large database that is heavily fragmented
can also be much slower than one'd expect.
No dup. chars.
