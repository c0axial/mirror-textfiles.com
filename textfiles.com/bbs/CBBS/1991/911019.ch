to ARMANDO ROSARIO re: R/CONTROLLER CARD IDE 

  Randy & I shop at Compu Electronics - ask for Ram (pronounced "rahm",
i.e. "ROM"!) - I bought an IDE drive there recently.  I had to go to
CompUSA for the controller BUT ONLY BECAUSE I needed an 8-bitter.  Ram
should have 16-bit IDE controllers.  Good guy.  Give him a try.
  I'm Kind of confused why you say you're looking for a controller, then
sort of casually mention you're looking for a drive.  Do you have another
IDE drive already?  I'd suggest getting both from the same place, for
simplicity of problem determination should you have problems.

The company is called Silicon Valley, they can be reached at 415 967-1100
The sales person I talked to was Katie, was wonderfull, knew just what the
problems were installing an IDE with a MFM or RLL drive. As I was
purchasing only a single drive, I purchased it thru HARD DRIVE. If your
a company you can submit a PO to Sillicon Valley. Believe the cost
ontrontroller was $79 dive or take a few $$$$. What you need to order
is a Model ADP60PWR from Harddrives. Good luck.....
