to ALL re: CHANGING FROM RLL TO IDE
 I am thinking of dropping my RLL drives (Seagate 65megger) and going
to an IDE type, like as not also a Seagate, 1234 I think. I have a
1989 CMOS, with about forty drive choices (AMI) I wonder if the
CMOS will take an IDE drive, or is there fiddling to be done?
