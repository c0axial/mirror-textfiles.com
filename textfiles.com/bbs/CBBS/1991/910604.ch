Msg 44814 is 15 line(s) on 06/01/91 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: IRQ CONFLICTS

  I'm kind of confused.  I'd think that 2 devices that use the same IRQ
could be used - providing they were enabled at different times.
  I have Lantastic, and on my 286-enhanced PC, I had to use IRQ7 for the
ethernet board.
  (I looked @ my Bullet 286 tech ref, it said: 0=timer, 1=keyboard,
2=reserved, 3=com2, 4=com1, 5=HD, 6=FD, 7=printer - thus I assigned it
to 7, since that seemed to be the only open interrupt.
  Now, I'm trying to run Lantastic Z, the serial/parallel version, to my
laptop.  Brooklyn Bridge, Laplink, etc, all work, but parallel Lantastic
doesn't work on the PC - I am thinking it might be a problem with IRQ7.
  I guess I should take apart the PC and pull the Lantastic AE2 adapter
long enough to see if Lantastic Z works - if it does, I have an IRQ
conflict, right?
  Curious for ideas.  I did find that Lantastic Z DOES use interrupts on
the parallel port; and it DOES work serial, just not parallel.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/IRQ CONFLICTS

Does the Lantastic have the capability to use IRQ's above 7?  If so, that
would work, wouldn't it, since you are using it on an AT (12 IRQ's, if I
remember correctly)?  Other than this, I don't have any other suggestions.

to WARD re: LANTASTIC

Ward; I too run LANtastic, and the "out-of-the-box" interrupts did not
work. I use IRQ=5, if that helps. I have had my eye on LANtastic Z as a
way to get the laptops on the net, other then the IRQ problem does it work
pretty well? I do have a XIRCOM pocket ethernet adapter which works pretty
well. Another interesting Atrisoft product is the Network Eye, any comments
on that?

two printers for sale:  Morrow MP100 is a daisywheel prinetr, 10 cps.
Star Gemini 10-x is 120 cps dot matrix printer.  Both in good
condition, ideal for a student.  Call 312-726-3555 days or leave a msg here.

to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/IBM.. CONTINUED

  I will contact this person regarding your equipment list.
  I don't know WHY there's been no reply (one way/other), but
don't feel too bad - I didn't even get an email acknowledgement
that I'd even sent anything.
   Grrrrr.

Msg 44819 is 17 line(s) on 06/03/91 from DONALD CROSS
to BILL WOLFF re: R/PRODIGY FOLLIES

     Hi.  I've seen some of the messages concerning Prodigy's ability to
scan users hard drives, and upload information from them elsewhere.  I
haven't done any extensive testing, but I did scan through my STAGE.DAT
with PC Magazines DR.COM utility.  What was there could easily be
explained away as disk clusters that had been part of previously erased
files.
     While I am satisfied that they haven't been doing anything real
unusual on my system, it occurs to me that there may be another way of
keeping tabs on a comm session with Prodigy.  It seems like it would be
a fairly easy task to write a TSR to log disk activity, probably something
simple enough to just log clusters that were accessed, and the type of a
access.  Then after communicating with Prodigy, another utility could tie
the accessed clusters back to their files, so as to produce a list of all
the files that were accessed, and how they were accessed.
     Actually, this sounds like something that could be usefull for
detecting, any untoward virus type activity too.  Maybe it's already been
done?  Anyway, it's just a thought.       Don Cross

to WARD re: CARDBOARD

Conversations with two knowledgable people regarding the Gateway spread
revealed that 1) the presence of plastic would make recycling the thing
rather difficult and 2) the per-magazine cost of the insert (NOT counting
design or set-up charges) could be as high as 50 cents.  I don't feel
like hunting for the the little legal notice that lists each magazine's
circulation, but I would think that would add up to big bucks pretty
fast.
No dup. chars.
