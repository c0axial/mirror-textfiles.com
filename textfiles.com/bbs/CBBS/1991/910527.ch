to ED FOSTER re: WINDOWS

  Dunno if "stay away from Windows" only applies during a storm or not,
but - hey, wouldn't "STORM" be an interesting name for a windows competitor?
("Stay away from windows")...
  Some people @ Comdex (from which I just returned) commented to Windows
in a way I've never heard before - "ShelfWare".  You buy it, you put it
on the shelf.

Msg 44800 is 03 line(s) on 05/24/91 from HARV MILLMAN
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/SOFTWARE FOR SALE

It's FastBack Plus.  I haven't opened the diskettes to see which version
it is.  It's never been used.  I'll be happy to furnish a "transfer of
license" letter.  It should be upgradable, if it's not the latest.

Msg 44801 is 05 line(s) on 05/25/91 from TOM YORK
to ALL re: C USERS GROUP

I am looking for a C users group in the northwest suburbs, does anyone know
of a local one, around my area...
Thanks,
Tom York
