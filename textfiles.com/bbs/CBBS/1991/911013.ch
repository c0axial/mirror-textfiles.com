to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/CNE?

I have a basic problem with the way support is provided by Novell.
Even if I go through the extremely expensive CNE training, I will still
need to maintain a CI$ account to keep up-to-date. In our first 2
weeks of connection, our on-line charges are already over $75, and that
is WITH tapcis! (which must be registered for $79, and to be truly useful
it needs tappet and some other utils, for extra cost, and it still beats
the pants off of CIM) The whole CI$ concept of message handling is flawed.
It would not be so bad if the traffic was not so high. But I cannot
avoid the CI$ connection, because of Netwire! Even the regular updates
to the NSE won't cut it if we have a problem that needs
an immediate fix. I just am feeling quite trapped by the volume of data
that I now need to handle, just to keep up with what is possibly wrong
with our equipment. The funny thing is, I am an extremely fast reader.
If my boss had to do this at his own reading pace, it just wouldn't get
done. Ridiculous. We need a new generation message handler. Tapcis
is a decent front end, just like trn is a decent front end to netnews.
But they both break down when presented with broken conversational
threads or high message volume. If I was just independantly wealthy, or
I worked for a company that had a reason to branch out into this kind
of software development, I'd do it meself. As it is, I have to hope
that someone else already has. Any suggestions?
