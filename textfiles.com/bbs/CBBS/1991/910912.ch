to JERRY OLSEN re: R/REMOTE COMPUTING

  What is your remote application?  When I first saw REMOTE, in about
maybe '86, I dialed into another guy's system, using ADM-3A emulation!
  I am looking at my PC Anywhere book, and sorry, it is from '86, so
things may have changed, but they HYPE the point that you don't HAVE
to even have a PC to call in.
  Of course if you need graphics, and if the 25th line "hokeyness"
necessitated by calling in with a 24-line screen are a problem, or if
you don't like having to press "esc-1" for F1, or "esc-U" for up-arrow,
then this isn't for you.  Depends upon the application, frequency of use,
need for convenience, etc.

to ALL re: LZH?

  Has anyone else "putzed" around with LZH algorithms?  I started with
a paper on it, and took the pseudo-code example it had, and implemented
it in my favorite programming language - PMATE editor macros (took under
300 keystrokes to code a full LZH encoding algorithm - this is a VERY
net programming language!).
  The output is basically a bunch of numbers.  The decoding program starts
with a table consisting of the possible codes in the "set" (such as
ascii, or all 256 possible binary values) and starts decoding.
  The thing I was wondering: do any lzh routines do a 2-pass technique,
in which, after encoding the LZH, they then Huffman encode the resulting
NUMBERS?
  Also in Pmate, I wrote an output number frequency histogram, and it seems
quite "clumpy", implying Huffman encoding would do a lot to further reduce
the output data size.
  Of course, other tricks could be used: if the output is a byte with
the 8th bit off, it is "straight ASCII", while if the 8th bit is on, then
it is perhaps a 11- or 15-bit value (ignoring the 8th bit) which represents
a point in the code table.   Here's the Pseudo-Code.
[1] Initialize string table; (to 256 entries, 00-FF for example)
[2] [.c.] <- empty;
[3] K <- next character in charstream;
[4] Is [.c.]K in string table?
 (yes: [.c.] <- [.c.]K;
     go to [3];
 )
 (no: add [.c.]K to the string table;
    output the code for [.c.] to the codestream;
    [.c.] <- K;
    go to [3];
 )

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/LZH?

What you're describing sounds more like LZW coding rather than LZH
(LZW was the coding scheme originally used in ARC.  It's fallen a bit
out of favor because Unisys has a patent on it and recently started
enforcing it).  The implementations of LZH that I've seen rely on a
"sliding dictionary" which keeps track of the last 8K or so of input.
If a string of text can be found in the dictionary, it's replaced with
a code consisting of an offset, length pair ("insert the 20 characters
that you saw 550 bytes ago").  These codes are then subjected to Huffman
compression.
No dup. chars.
