]sorry for the short connect.  line noise was atrocious, so i'm backing
out gracefully.  don't know what kind of policy you have regarding
required frequency-of-calling-to-avoid-account-deletion, but i'd appreciate
any waiver you can make.  i can't afford *much* ld calling, and will
only call occasionally, but i'd like to maintain my account here.
as a sysop (murphy's law bbs, raleigh, nc, 919-664-8060), i consider
it a bit of an honor to have an account on the *first* bbs!  thanks!

  I'll bet people could THINK that stage.dat is sucking data out of their
system - for the simple reason that it is created by block writing a chunk
of memory, so what ever "garbage" is in memory at the time appears in
stage.dat, and is eventually overwritten by what is received from Prodigy.

Borland C++ (retail $495) has its own windows sdk include (from Whitewater

VSI Distributors is going to sell its computer system.
Alpha Micro AM100L (7 poss terminals, 6 being used. 3 printers, vcr backup,
Alpha Ledger accounting software including UPS manifesting (v.88.1{1}),
If ANYONE knows of someone who might need a distribution system,
PLEASE give me a call at 708/498-4130 (voice). Thank you.

Hmm... that is interesting Ward, since Prodigy claims it only uploads
the file called STAGE.DAT from your system. What in the world do
they care what is in the memory before you boot up to Prodigy? <BW>

to ALL re: CIRCA 1980 IBM/#5217 PTR

I have come across an IBM system/23, which was a precursor to the PC.
I have been told, it was IBM's internal answer to the PC market, and
was the casuse of the IBM/PC being developed externally.  Anyways,
these tings appear to be white elephants.  A controller card went
dead in the printer # 5217, which is a bin fed, daisy wheel printer.
IBM wanted $450 to walk in the door, and the card is $2500.  Needless
to say, this is just a little high.  I am looking for a
"Newman Computer Exchange" type of business that deals in old IBM
equipment.  Is there someone out there buying these things, or are
they literally being throw away.  I would like to get either a
replacement printer or the card.  While the card does not look too
complex, since all the part numbers are IBM it is impossible to
try and pick/guess/ or swap chips.  ANy ideas ???

Hi.  I just read the April issue of Boardwatch Magazine (first time
I pick it up), and I am grateful that you were willing to share some
of your life with us.  I have been aware of your BBS since I started
my trek through BBS Land sometime back in '83.  Its good to see
that you have the dedication and patience to hang on.  Since BBSing
is a big part of my life (I should say computers in general), of
course I look up to you as one of the men (and women) that have
made major contributions to this incredibly exciting hobby (I am 30,
and follow your philosophy on marriage and computers...).  Again,
thanks for sharing your knowledge and enthusiasm with all of us.
You truly helped to make my life more enjoyable!   -Jim Kliora

to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/SCOPE RENTAL NEEDED

I don't have the catalog immediately at hand, so can't provide a phone
number. But "GE Rents," a national business of GE, rents scopes and a
variety of other electronic gear. (They also sell used gear in large
quantities as they upgrade their rental offerings.) I'm not entirely
sure, but I THINK they have an 800 number, so calling 1-800-555-1212
may get you in touch with them....If you're interested but have trouble
locating a number/address for them, let me know. Next time I call (a day
or a week from now), I could dig a little.

to ARNOLD BOYD re: R/NEED SCREEN SAVER PGM

There are a lot of fancy programs out there, but if simple will
do, I've written a small PD ditty (occupies about 300 bytes), which is
released with a set-up program to redefine the number of minutes before
blanking occurs. Unlike some alternatives, mine has lived in harmony with
all TSRs I run. The only "gotcha" is that mine will return garbage to
your screen if it kicks in during a break while in graphics mode. I use
the latter so infrequently that I just remove the blanker from memory
as part of the loading process for the graphics programs. If of use for
you, the archive (and some alternatives) are available on a BBS I run:
The Advocate/NOWAR, 312.939.4411, 24 hrs., 8/n/1, Loop area. I don't
recall the precise archive name, but like most it's something resembling
SCRNSAVE.xxx. (Doing "SEARCH" for "DOS" + "SAVE" should produce a list of
programs, including mine.) Hope this helps....

I was unaware that last week the Wall Street Journal also reported that
Prodigy had the ability to peek into the user's computer system. Also
for those that are GEnie User's, check out page 8015 under "A Networker's
Journal (910510) by Charles Bowen. <BW>

  The PKLITE runs only certain files. NO overlays or EXEs. Have
to check these out also. That other one was OK but still doesn't
fit the job. I seem to be with others now that NEED space and
can't afford to sacrifice swapping drive letters due to program
setups.

  Hope the Round Table doesn't have one of those call back setups.
I quite after seeing that. Heck the sysops even know more about me
thanI of them after logging on some BBSs.
No dup. chars.
