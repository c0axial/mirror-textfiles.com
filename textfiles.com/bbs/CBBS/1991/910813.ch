to ALL re: MULTIPLE IDE DRIVES?

  IDE drives seem so "simple" yet "mysterious".  Most come with no docs,
and ditto no docs with the controllers!
  How is one to know how to set up a 2nd drive?

to ALL re: SCSI-ST02->100M?

  Got a call from CACHE Ex-Prez Bill Precht today.  He's looking at adding
a 2nd Scsi drive to his ST-02 controller.
  Seagate said that the ST-02 wasn't made for drives > 100M (although
he's already using it for one).  They recommended DTC or Future domain,
and of course, Seagate's own drive.
  Would this likely just be a matter of performance - i.e. the ST-01 and
ST-02 are "low-end" controllers, and you're better off with a more
powerful controller for larger drives?
