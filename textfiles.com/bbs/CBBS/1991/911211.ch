Msg 45330 is 16 line(s) on 12/09/91 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL. re: BUILDING PC SYSTEM

  If you're interested in minor upgrades, or major ones, or putting
pieces together, I'd like to recommend Compu Electronics, across the street
from the ElekTek in Lincolnwood - 708 679-2667.  "Ram" (pronounced "Rahm"
which I guess you could also say is "ROM") is the owner, and a great guy.
  I just picked up a 386/sx/25, mini-tower, 4M, 2-ser+1-p+g, etc, and moved
my old floppies, hard disk, video, and tape into it - finally retiring my
Bullet-286'd original 5-slot PC.  This thing hums!  BUT we're talking real
HACKING - I stared at cables trying to figure which way they go in, etc.
  But I got it working - and with some help from Randy, figured out that
the problems I had were that "something" is interfering with port 300,
which was where my Lantastic board is.  (Just dawned on me, that might
have been the EMS port - I'll bet that's it - the AMI BIOS setup is GREAT!)
  Good prices, good service, and a real personal touch.  From bits and
pieces to full systems, though I've not gotten a "full" system since my
original PC!  I've only 'hacked' since then...No, I guess I got an AST
Premium 286 a few years ago...('87).

  >optional Epson/Proprinter III emulation cartridge
**NOT** supported on the 500!  They say essentially "Since the Deskjet has
been so widely accepted, most packages supporte it directly so we
don't support the Epson or Proprinter emulation in the 500C.
  As to trying transparencies and envelopes, well, people are calling and
saying "What the heck did you print that envelope with???" - because I
use corel draw to do a color spread (red top, to blue on bottom) across
the 3 lines of addr, etc (grin).  Transparencies are OUTSTANDING - but you've
got to go with the rather pricey HP ones - they are "coated" so the front
is - get this - water soluble.

to ALL  re: DJ 500C SCALEABLE FONTS?

  Curious if anyone has installed the driver and used JUST the HP fonts -
someone asked me how they are, I had to say "I don't know, I always use
Adobe Type Manager".  I'm not even sure how to defeat ATM and try the
other fonts - or rather am not really motivated to try.

to ALL re: BUY KEYBOARD?

  Of the stuff I bought at Compu Electronics Saturday, the keyboard is the
one I struggle with the most.  It has that darned "large enter key" as if
my fingers weren't accurate enough to type on a smaller one!  In return for
this annoying big key, the used-a-lot-in-dos \ key is now further away.  On
several occasions Sunday, I hit the TOP of the enter key, thinking the
\ key was there, so for example entering to copy to D: instead  of D:\...
  Curious if anyone knows of an ENHANCED keyboard - preferrably with
switchable control & caps - though I'm doing that in software right now.

to MARTY DIPPEL re: R/TONY'S BOARD

Well, people like what people like.  I was horrified recently to see
someone using WordPerfect as a data editor!!  But
it's really a  case of knowing what you liike
and liking what you know.  I grew up with EMACS of
one form or another (I started with  Perfect Writer in
1983 or so), so I like it.  But people who got used to WordStar will
always hate EMACSes.  I agree that VI is VIle, but if you learned it
first...I used to know one person who ran a version of WYLBUR on her
PC...

Kill message 45142, will you?  I read that one eons ago.

Msg 45337 is 11 line(s) on 12/11/91 from JERRY OLSEN
to BYRON GRUSH re: R/DEC RAINBOWS

I have a client which has a few of those beasts still in service. My
recollection is that the serial port (unlike almost everything else
about the thing!) is IBM-compatible. The main problem is that the comm.
program distributed with it uses proprietary protocols which were so
utterly strange that I gave up on direct connections with anything
else. The most practical solution is a version of Media Master written
expressly for the Rainbow, which works well.

I almost hate to suggest this, as I'm slowly weaning them from the
Rainbows, but if you would like, I could pass along your phone number
in case they're interested in contacting you.

blurb into the welcome message again.
