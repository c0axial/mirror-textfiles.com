]=Ward, re full: I think we went thru this a couple years ago.
I tried h;full cuz you had tried it in response to someone's inquiry
and I wanted to see what you got.  We have a couple of items in
keywords under "F" so I was checking out the differences.
"Keywords" is where I used to hang out a century or two ago on
CBBS and CASAT.

to CHRIS S. SUSI re: BBS - ADS - ETC

  Thanks, I don't wish to participate in such a thing.  Due to my hate of
advertising, I haven't watched commercial TV (channels 2, 5, 7, 9, 32)
in about 3-4 years, and I just cancelled the last of my magazines, brought
on by my intolerance for the cardboard that has to be fought.  The idea of
BBS's running ads - well, I would hang up in the middle of such an ad, and
erase its number from my calling directory.
No msg 44807

to WARD re: CARDBOARD

What do you think of Gateway's little extravaganza that appeared in PC
Mag a couple weeks ago and Computer Shopper this month?  I wonder what
percentage of each system's price went into creating that ad?  Cardboard
is bad enough, but plastic now?

to ED F. / WARD C. re: WINDOWS

Microsoft must be driving interior designers nuts.  First we have
"wallpaper for Windows" and now we have "Windows on the shelf."  If
there were a sudden dropoff in Windows sales, would we be talking about
"Microsoft Curtains"?

Hi Cliff! Well I am glad you did some tests. It appears that Prodigy
software you had looks legitimate enough. Although it isn't always what
some have reported. Either they are mistaken or something. Another thing
that maybe a big problem is that Prodigy can update your software at every
time you call. So there are likely many different versions of Prodigy
floating around. Mine was updated last in DEC89 I believe.

The big deal I think isn't that they are controlling your computer or not,
but they can without the user knowing about it. Some users may even have
very important information on there computers at work and installed Prodigy
for fun. A guy can get fired without knowing that this can happen. I think
the warning should be posted, as I believe it is at the user's risk. Though
they need the correct information to make that choice, right? Hmm... I also
see a future for a third party hardware device that would record all RS-232
communications. It would also be nice to have a modem that would have a
listen mode. You know, having a second computer with a modem recording what
the first one is doing on the line. Hmm... what a wonderful idea. <BW>
No dup. chars.
