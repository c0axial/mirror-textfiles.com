  Sorry, I have not idea - your msg in the LOG only went to me and a few
others.  Please leave a msg to ALL.  Good luck!

One point which was already addressed, but I want to add my own experience
as well. I have two Magnavox monitors which are the same, but one is one
year old and the other is about 4 years old. Also the older one is also
on much longer than the newer one. Now if I didn't have both to compare
to, I would say that the older one is just like new. But the truth is,
it takes longer to power up and it is slightly out of focus for awhile.
I also just ordered a third Magnavox monitor and may also learn that the
other one may also show signs of wear. It's really pretty hard to judge
without a fresh view on what it is suppose to be.
   I would guess that your monitor takes longer to fire up and also it
may be slightly out of focus when first turned on. Also another thing
will soon or does now is the contrast will be getting weaker. Although
adjusting the contrast over the years you may not notice this either.

The Cubs are notout of it yet. They must get better pitching, and if Maddux and
Castillo pitch well, there's no telling how far this team can go.
George Bell has proven to be the super-star many expected, but Jackson and
Smith have been busts. Here's an idea, make Chuck McElroy the closer.
He has pitched downright awesome, with a 1.50 ERA and a lot of strike outs.
His only problem is he just plain walks too many.
The Cubs need to sweep the Braveand stros, to get over the .500 mark.
If they can do this they'll be about 9-1/2 back, and back in the hunt.

I just got my computer again, and I need a list of BBS's.
Especially those on which you can talk live toother users, game BBs's, and
genealogyBB's. Do you know where I can get this information. Please let me
know. Thank you.
