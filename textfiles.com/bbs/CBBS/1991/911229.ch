Msg 45379 is 11 line(s) on 12/24/91 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to LENDELL FERGUSON re: R/DISK DRIVE NEEDED

  What kind of machine do you have?  What kind of floppy drive do you want?
There are 5 kinds that I know - in 5.25" there are 360K, 1.2M, and kludge
80 track low density ones (I have a Teac 55F - a special driver gets
800K on it), and in 3.5" there is 720K, 1.44M, and now even 2.88M.
  What you can put on your system will depend upon your controller.
A PC or XT with the 37-pin floppy connnector on the back can support
an external 720K 3.5" or a 360K 5.25", but not 1.44 or 1.2M.
  If you don't have an external 37-pin floppy connector, you'll need another
floppy controller - one that can be addressed to be different from the
first one.
  Details!  Details!  (grin)
