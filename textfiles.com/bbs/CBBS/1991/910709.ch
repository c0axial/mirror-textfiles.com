  I don't begin to fully understand IDE, because I "vaguely" thought there
were "XT" IDE drives, and "AT" IDE drives, but from my limited experience,
I'd have to say perhaps more that there are "XT" IDE controllers, and
"AT" IDE controllers.  I merely asked for an 8-bit IDE controller - $47
from CompUSA.  Worked like a charm.  I was somewhat "spooked" about it
working, and bought (from Compu Electronics, a 16-bit combo IDE and floppy
controller.  It was even cheaper!

I don't know how to compare your experience to mine.  I've knocked around alot.
I did my thesis work in a rather obscure area of experimental atomic physics.
I picked a good working knowledge of high vacuum systems, low noise
electronics, electron optics, and some engineering skills in the process.
After I graduated, I worked for Warneke electron tubes designing RF amplifier
tubes. That was abummer. I went back to the universities and banged around
from one visiting position to another.  The money was lousy and my debts were
growing.  So back to industry. I went to work for Zenith at their tube
manufacturing facility. Did all sorts of non-interesting stuff involving CRT
manufacturing.  I was then offered a job with a CAT scan manufacturer.  The
best job I ever had. All state of the art, and I worked with the brightest
group of engineers and Ph.D.'s  I have ever seen.  Incidentally, some of the
best engineers were non-degreed.  Unfortunately the company went belly up like
so many others in the field. I then went to Magnaflux who was interested in
starting up an imaging system. They ran out of money and went into hard times,
and I was back pounding the pavement.  I decided eneough was enough.  Zenith
hired me back into their R&D facility in Glenview. I thought I would retire
from there. But the cloud was still over my head. BAck in Noveember '87 Zenith
wiped out all its R&D and 2 floors of employees were beating paths to
Unemployment Insurance.  Since then I have been consulting, teaching part time,
and picking up any job that interests me.  Most of the consulting has been
computer related, but I am now getting involved in a project out east involving
the imaging of radiation leakage from power plants.  This should be the most
interesting work I've done for some time since it involves developing a new
technology.  Anyway that is a super brief history of what I have done.

Hi Eric! That's funny as that's the same place as were I got mine at.
Another thing is, other than that one trip, I've never been there since. It
was the first and the last trip.

Hi Murray! I know what you mean. R&D departments isn't where one usually makes
a good living. Also when money gets tight, trimming the R&D department seems
to be the first thing to happen. That policy seemed to always get a company in
trouble down the line, but I don't make the rules, I just work with them. It's
always been that way as long as I can remember. I know of a lot of sad tales
about engineers (especially electronic engineeers). Too bad lots of people
like this field so much, maybe that is why it can be real tough and maybe
that's why you can buy electronics at real bargan prices.

An interesting note came my way in school which there was more R&D put into
color television than what was put into getting man to the moon. Speaking
about getting to the moon, I also worked on the VTAS computer system that was
engineered to get man to the moon. No I didn't design it, but used them for
navagation in high tech aircraft in the middle 70's. Yes at the time it was
sort of over kill. Neat little package (about the size of a standard monitor),
though nowadays, it's no big deal. They didn't use wiring harnesses for some
reason and used 40 gauge wires all over the bottom side. They ran in a
straight line from one point to another, a real mess if some wires had broken
off. It was like trying to find a needle in the hay stack.

I also noticed that a good number of good engineers didn't have any degrees
either. I suppose that didn't help in getting a job either. As usually those
without degrees got less money and was usually plentiful in the field. Well
it's really tough for just about everyone right now in all fields. I am
thinking of doing something totally different myself. It seems that the
computer has been also been replacing good engineers. Nowadays, some computers
systems are designing curcuits themselves with only minimum information given
to it. Who knows what will happen? If computers now can beat the best humans
at chess, it may not be long till computers can out design the best engineers?
I hope the best for us all.

Yah, I guess times are tough all over. The physics community has had a major
battle going on over the lack of employment.  The youngsters want to kick the
old timers out so that they can have their jobs.  When times get tough the milk
of human kindness has a sour taste to many.  Fortunately, I've always kept a
number of lines in the water. Something always seems to come along and bite.
There's always the option of kissing the world of high tech off and becoming
a farmer. As long as you don't want to make a "living" at it.  Just sit back
and let the "rest of the world go by".
No dup. chars.
