Msg 45185 is 17 line(s) on 10/26/91 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: COLOR DESKJET

  Well, I got to see "my next printer" at Comdex - the Color DeskJet was
REALLY nice.  Unfortunately, it uses a small carriage just like the current
DeskJet, so only holds a tri-color (CYM) cartridge, -or- a black one.
  I know from my experience, that taking a cartridge out, can be a problem,
but they've "solved" that by selling the printer with a "box" about a little
smaller than a recipe box - and it has the necessary rubber gasket to seal
the cartridge when "plugged in the box" rather than being plugged in the
printer.
  I had my card run thru their machine so I should be getting upgrade info
thru the mail when ever HP gets time to process all the cards from Comdex.
  I heard they'd be available in a month - then again on Compuserve I saw
one guy who had one already.  Anyone know?
  P.S. they will still take the OLD cartridges, too!  I suspect what the
color one does is simply fire diff jets within the same patter, but not
sure.  It might be interesting to plug a color cartridge in an old deskjet -
then again it might fry the printer and/or the cartridge...
  I think the street price will be < $1K, and the upgrade price is ca. $500.
