  For info on BBS LISTs, type this (admittedly obscure) command:
  or;-80,bbs list
That means (O)ne line summary, with auto-(R)etrieve; back 80 msgs from
the end or last msg, with keywords of "bbs" and "list".

I don't know what your asking for really, but if it is a CP/M emulator for
MS-DOS. Then here is what is available that I am aware of. This partial
list is from CFOG's BBS.

22NCE126.ZIP    75157  04-09-90  CP/M 2.2 emulator for MSDOS!
22NCE124.ARC    75776  12-18-88  Terminate-Stay-Resident
  Latest version of Sydex's 22NICE CP/M 2.2 emulator.  Loads a memory
  resident module that allows running CP/M programs right from the PC's
  drive.  Includes terminal emulators to emulate popular CP/M computers and
  terminals.  This updated version does not need to be always present in
  memory - it can be loaded as needed to run CP/M programs.   Shareware.
Z80MU52B.ARC   117760  11-10-89  Terminate-Stay-Resident
  Run CP/M programs on MS-DOS computers. I believe this version may only
  support V20 and V40 CPU's. Otherwise you need Z80MU310 version which is
  much slower and older. <BW>

to ALL re: DAMARK PURCHASES

You might have remembered me mentioning that one computer newsletter that I
received had advised caution when purchasing from Damark, 7101 Winnetka
Ave. N., Minneapolis, MN 55428. Well I received my very first order from
them and I was very surprised. They advertised a Magnavox RGB/composite
color monitor for $99.99 + $12.50 for shipping and handling. Yes I got a
monitor, it wasn't Magnavox (it's a HeadStart M-888C, btw what are these
going for?), nor did it have any composite video inputs. Something of which
I was very interested in having. I also know a great deal about Magnavox
monitors which is one reason on why I felt confident in ordering one.
Another interesting thing about the shipment, is that no manual or any kind
of instructions came with this thing. The catalog said there was a one year
warrantee for the Magnavox, but this isn't a Magnavox! Now what?

Ah... but Damark has a legal way out of this in small print in their
catalog by saying: "Substitutions - If the requested merchandise has been
sold out. DAMARK may substitute merchandise of equal or greater value. If
you not completely satisfied, you may return the substituted merchandise
within 14 days for a refund... (excluding shipping & handling charges)"
That means it will cost me about 10 more dollars to get back my $99.99 and
I lose $22 and haven't got a monitor to keep. A call to customer service
was very interesting. The lady told me that they didn't have any Magnavox
monitors yet, I asked if I could ship this one back to get a Magnavox when
they come in? She stated that she believes they won't be in, but I could
ship this one back for a refund. Of course, in small print it says I need
to include the warrantee cards and manuals too, of which I never got.
Hmm... could it be that they never had any intentions of selling any
Magnavox monitors, but merely used Magnavox's name to pickup orders for the
other lesser brand? She also suggested that I should call Magnavox's
customer service about the composite problem. I asked why, it's not a
Magnavox monitor to begin with? Do I dare ship this without manuals?

Anyone know what the used price on HP IIP lasers are lately?
If they are cheap enough, is 2 or 4 meg the best mem to get?

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/IDE 'PRIMARY FORMAT'??

   Do NOT low-level format your IDE drive!  (Your "Primary Format" is
probably a real LL format, BTW.)  You're guaranteed to trash the drive AND
your warranty on it if you do.  Your ST1144 uses Zone-Bit Recording and
so has a different number of sectors per track in different areas.
   I have a file from Seagate that might have the info you're looking
for.  I'll try to format it for the message length here and upload it in
a bit.
No dup. chars.
