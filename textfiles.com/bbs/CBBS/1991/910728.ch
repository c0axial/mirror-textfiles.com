]Greetings guys!

Thought it was about time that I dropped in to see how it was going.
Yes, the long-distance cousin system still lives, in fact they even
wrote about us not too long after they wrote about you!

Ok, it was not much of an article...  Ok, it was not an article...
Alright, I'll admit it...  They just mentioned that we were just about
the only system left running that was on the first published BBS list.
But hey, it was SOMETHING!     B^}

Tried to call Ward's system first, but it does not seem to be there?
Heck, I know how that goes...

Well... all for now I guess.  Best wishes to all!

BTW:  version 4???  whats new now???

]Ward, I can't spend anymore time here today but, I promise that at
some point I will play with it.  By the way, did you tell Randy that
I received a retroactive raise that was activated at my four month
date.  If you didn't and Randy is reading this...then Hi Randy!  How
are you?  My job is great...and I am going to finish school except
it will take a little longer because I started my career a little early.
Regardless, I want to thank you for the advice you gave me before I
took this job!  I think that's all I have time to say.  I'm in the
office again and have lots to prepare for tomorrow.  Ward-When you
get this message giv a call...Talk to you guys soonBYE

When is the next Hamfest in the Chicagoland area?  Is there a BBS that keeps
a current list of dates/times/places?  Thanks in advance!

Msg 45016 is 03 line(s) on 07/25/91 from JERRY OLSEN
to MAX KOHN re: R/GENIE USERS MANUAL

I would have the same interest in the GEnie manual as for the CIS manual
we discussed over on my system. See a msg I put up there a few minutes
ago about working out details. Thx.

Msg 45017 is 17 line(s) on 07/25/91 from JERRY OLSEN
to WARD re: R/MATCH DIR'S

That's an interesting idea for a "directory utilities" package of mine.
In the meantime, though, a quick (and by no means thorough) check of the
latest Encyclopedia of Shareware doesn't reveal anything quite like what
you want. It does, however, list a few duplicates-deletion programs which
might be workable in tandem with PCOPY (or better, perhaps, with PMOVE).
What *I* have been doing in similar cases is combining a couple of
programs in my DirUtils package. ADIR will display two DIRs (actually,
up to 6) in whatever sort order desired. After identifying what I want
to zap, I use ADEL with parms for all filespecs I want to zap. (You can
specify as many as you can stuff onto the command line.) ADEL also lets
you further narrow "matching" filespecs by date or date range and has
three levels of confirmation. Used together, these features let you
specify enough about the files you want to zap to encompass them, then--
if some files you want to KEEP are among those which would be zapped, you
can specify forced-confirmation mode. You also can do these (and other)
functions recursively, if desired, which I have set up as a CLEANUP.BAT
to rid my hard disks of all temp files.

Msg 45018 is 04 line(s) on 07/25/91 from AL HIGGINS
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/HP PRICES

ELEK-TEK is selling NEW HP IIPs still for $849. The used computer
places are trying to sell a used or referbed for $750-900. If I
was a betting person, I'd purchase a new one, unless you can find
one at a good price! Good Luck!!!

Msg 45019 is 05 line(s) on 07/25/91 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to AL HIGGINS re: R/HP PRICES

  I was wondering about used prices. Thought there might be more
response and that would mean that some are upgrading and getting rid
of used IIPs. Guess they are few and far between. I really don't
have HEAVY use for one and wouldn't buy one from a 3rd party. Knowing
the past use would prove invaluable.

Msg 45020 is 10 line(s) on 07/25/91 from MAX KOHN
to JERRY OLSEN re: R/GENIE USERS MANUAL

I wasn't aware of your interest in the GEnie manual. In that case, expect a
call from me tomorrow so we can arrange delivery of these manuals.
I have read and replied to your message on your bbs. I do noot want
to trust US Mail so we'll have to arrange mutually convenient meeting.
I also do not want this meeting to inconvenience Carol either. Please make
sure that when we arrange the meeting it won't be interrupting
anything you or she may be planning. I'll call you tomorrow so we can work it
out.

Msg 45021 is 06 line(s) on 07/26/91 from CLIFF SHARP
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/HP PRICES

   People don't appear to be upgrading from the IIP.  That's probably
why you're not finding good prices on used units.  Although the III is
a MUCH better unit, people are used to the idea that they're getting
really nice performance from the IIP and they seem to be hanging on to
them.  You might not find the deal you want on one, and might end up
buying a new one; might as well, from the prices we've seen here.
