to ALL re: OS/2 INSTALL

Before putting 50 Megs of DOS files at risk...does anyone know what
the options, trade-offs, and considerations are for installing OS/2
on my MSDOS 5.0 machine might be? I just got the IBM 1.3 upgrade
and would really like to install it with the High Performance File
System, while keeping all my DOS files. Documentation for the upgrade
is sparse...lots of how, but no what-if. Probably assumes you knew
1.2 or some silly thing like that. Any long term OS/2 users out there?
What options do I have?
No dup. chars.
