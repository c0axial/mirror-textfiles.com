Thanks for your response.  Since there have been no negative
responses, I'll go with the 3 ms steprate.

Ward, back in my old Chicago/CP/M days, I used to have a Kaypro 2
(well, I still do, but).  Anyway.  It had a metal keyboard
case and, when I was charged up and touched it, it would freeze the
keyboard. I don't know why, since the case was grounded, except to
think that the tiny conductors in the 'phone cable they used for
keyboard connection didn't handle things too well.
 In any event, I became convinced that the problem lay in
a chip that simply 'latched' when power was applied.  I could easily
fix the problem by unplugging the keyboard and plugging it back in.
 I suspect something similar on your serial port.  I'd wager that if you
could remove ALL POWER from the machine, it would reset the serial port
to normal.  Problem is, especially in laptops, that turning off the
power doesn;t really TURN OFF THE POWER.  All sorts of
those little electron guys are running around in there all the time,
and you know what that means.
 Try removing the batteries (unless there are soldered-in backups) and
see what happens.  I'd just BET that fixes the serial port.  Of
course, there goes your setup information... ;-$

to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/STATIC #2

  Sometimes even removing power is not enough.  With a recent series of
motherboards, it was possible to set up a memory/wait state configuration
that would not allow the machine to run.  Removing the battery was not
sufficient to clear it. (Either a cap or the CMOS chip itself was capable
of holding a small yet large enough charge to sustain the chip's memory
for some time.  |With battery and power removed, a pin had to be shorted
to ground.
     As a follow up to the serial port question, and the 1488/89 chips
and associated circuitry, with power off, taking both pin 2 & 3 to ground
might clear the port.  ( I pulled the chips last time I had a freeze and
it cleared it... I'll have to try the above next time and report back)

to ALL re: SWITCHES ON V-CARD& SYNC'S

    I am trying to hookup a non-standard (Apollo) large screen monitor to
my PC.  After going through all of my video card manuals, none of them s
state what the actual functions of the 4 switches are, yet all of them seem
to be doing the same thing (VGA & multi mode cards)....
Does anyone know what the exact functions of these switches are???
  2) The apollo monitor takes only 1 sync signal in (combined horz & vert)
and may be aldo allow one to come in the sync signal and the other on the
GREEN singal.  Is there a simple circuit for combining the PC's horz & vert
sync signals into 1 composite signal to feed to the monitor?

The public domain communications program known a kermit comes
originally from Columbia U. but was written by Joe DOUPNIK  OF
Utah State U.  The version which I use is 3.0 AND does a
vt100 emulation.  If you wish to call me...
