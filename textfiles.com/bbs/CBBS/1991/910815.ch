When, oh, when are we going to see some legitimate online services?
These guys all seem bent on ripping off the general computing public.
I considered subscribing to BIX for awhile, but never was overly impressed
with the service overall.

Tell us if you find an online service worth its salt.  GEnie sure isn't
anymore.  I dropped them like a hot rock after the rate structure change,
but there isn't anything else comparable around.  <sigh>

Out of curiosity? wha do you look for in an online service?
It seems you haven't found one you like...so what would you like to
see? perhaps someone here might know of one that would fit your
interests.

Phil,
  Long time no type... Heard of your new job via Lee D.  He is now in
Calif.  Also, I misplaced (lost) the power supply to that modem I
got from you ages ago.  Do you have a desciption of the voltages it
put or or possibly another PS?  Give me a call at home (312)472-1331

I'm considering a couple of IBM clones from CompuSoft Plus in Wood
Dale to purchase for a client. Everything else checks out, but I'm
unfamiliar both with that firm and with CDI America motherboards,
which they use. Does anyone have any experience with either? Thanks.
