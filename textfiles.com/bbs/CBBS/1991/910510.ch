  Look for NEWSPACE.ZIP, X_V23.ZIP, and PKLTE103.
  I think NEWSPACE will on everything, X_V23 runs compressed programs
and batch files out of a ZIPfile, and PKLTE runs programs from a ZIP.
  And don't ask me how well any of them work, because I've never
tried them; just reporting to you some of the things available.

to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/DISK COMPRESS

Well, you should be able to find the program on the Round Table BBS
(312) 777-9480.  If not, and you're unable to locate it elsewhere, leave a
message to me here and we can set up transfer to a mutually logged onto
system.

Msg 44745 is 11 line(s) on 05/09/91 from MICHAEL SHARTIAG
to ALL re: SCOPE SPEEDS

On a lark, I hooked up my scope to a Racore network system, running on
co-ax cable. The manufacturer had provided scope pictures of what a good
line looked like, acceptable and bad.  They said a 60-100 Mhz scope was
needed.  DUe to desperation, I tried by BK 30 Mhz scope on it, and
I was able to see the signal, and trigger on it just fine.  While I
did not have the .2 Usec sweep, .1 did just fine. I was able to see
it OK, plus had a 5X magnifier switch.  The aplitute was OK....
   By big question is:  What was I giving up with the slower scope?
The transfer rate on the net is supposedly 10mbits/sec.
In idle mode the net sends out a polling sequence every 10usecs or so.
Did I lose aplitude?

to ALL re: NEED PLANTZ'S BBS #

I installed new software and didn't save the BBS numbers.  If some one
could leave a few of the better bbs #'s , and Gene Plantzs # I would
appreciate it.

Msg 44747 is 03 line(s) on 05/09/91 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/SCOPE SPEEDS

What you lose is (1) the ability to see short noise spikes and (2)
the ability to measure rise and fall times accurately (pulse edges
will appear more rounded than they really are).
No dup. chars.
