  That's about the net of it.  Prices have probably fallen (this was
Jan I believe).  The "funky" format of above was because I extracted
it right from Clyde Washburn's downloadable price list from Compuserve
(Not REALLY downloadable - he emailed it to me).
  Video and disk (Sorry, can't say "DASD" when I'm not at work) were
things I had from my previous system, even keyboard.  So all I bought
was the above - MB, memory, case, P.S., and a combo-board.
  No, haven't tried OS/2.  I've got 1.3, but even if it did work, the
only thing I'd want to do is over-write it with my beloved DOS anyway
(for example, the first TSR I load is a control-caps swapper - can't
STAND the en-yucked keyboard - my 2 most heavily used utilities -
TreeView and Pmate (& Kedit) editors, are all totally control key driven).

  1. get a new PMAP; -or-
  2. use the MEMORY command built in to DOS.  Some of its operands go into
quite significant details
  Other people using DOS 5 get unbelievable results - wonder why you don't
see any increase in available memory?  You using DOS=high, and loadhigh's
on your config.sys stuff?  (I'm not sure about TSRs that come up in
autoexec - is there a "loadhigh" on them?).  Using Blue Max on a PS/2,
one which isn't yet supported by their BIOS compression, gives me
five hundred thirty something free WITH LANTASTIC LOADED.  It crammed
Cxxx full of stuff.  Then again, Blue Max has "Maximize" which compresses
things "optimally" - I noticed it had 80 bytes free in C000-Cfff.

Hi again, thanks for the (crc) info....
I know I'm being lazy, but can't find this in your help file...
When I want to look at all replys to a msg, is there a 'thread' function
for retrieving them?
Talk to ya later.....

I am looking for a position in software consulting or in computer
operations. I have an Associate's Degree in computer science and have
functioned as a computer room aide and operator on a volunteer
basis. I have a rather extensive educational background in this field
and can easily pick up on any software package and on how to run a system. If
you can provide any leads, I'd be appreciative. Thanks.
