  Ooh, that's a bummer!  I always hate it when software changes - to
be more "modern" but less flexible.
  Just tonight, I got a beta copy of a VERY popular program (one of
the top 20 sellers) and Sonofabitch!  They changed from "pick 3 colors
you like - normal text, highlight, and reverse", to color SETS, none
of which are the least acceptable to me!  When you choose one with
black backgrounds, they throw up ugly white text.  I just don't like
colored backgrounds!  I'm REALLY bummed!  Tonight on CIS the prez of
the company himself asked whether I'd had a chance to try the beta test
yet.  Heck, I may lose a friendship over the degree to which I responded
about not ever loading it again - that I couldn't stand it.
  Owell.
  What can you do?  I guess the best thing is to see if they have a log
of the # of users, and compare the # of users in a month before the VT100
schlock was installed, to a month after - to see if they've cut down a
lot on use.

  CBBS died a few weeks ago, and was down for quite a while.  What was
wrong was that the hard drive got tired and stopped spinning.  Randy
took it apart, gave it a kick start, then backed it up over a
Lantastic network, put in a new drive, and we're back!  (Whew!)

See previous msg.  It was a severe hard disk crash that took a while to
get the time and ambition to work on.  Backups are too much to expect,
sadly.  I'll have to back up more across the "wire" to my house, I
guess.
