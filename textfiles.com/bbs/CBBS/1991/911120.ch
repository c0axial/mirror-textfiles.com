to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/STICKTION

  Heh heh, I realized a few days after leaving you that msg about the PS/2
3.5" diskette "door", that my 3.5" has one too!  It is just that this one
isn't "black" so you see it (grin).
  On the subject of fliters:  One thing that differentiats an "industrial"
computer from a normal one is usually filters.

Msg 45274 is 03 line(s) on 11/20/91 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: FILTERS

Well, given all of the machines I've seen that have been used
by smokers, ALL computers ought to have filters.  It's an amazing
amount of junk that gets into a machine!

Msg 45275 is 04 line(s) on 11/20/91 from AL HIGGINS
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/COLOR DESKJET

I understand you can evenve, if that works.... I just bought
one !!!!!!!
