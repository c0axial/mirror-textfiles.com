to JERRY OLSEN re: R/FAT TABLES /REBUILDING

CHKDSK will not run if the FAT is corrupted (or at least if both copies are) )
While I am not sure how recover works, I know that it created file names and
associated links of block with them.  My problem is that the file names
are all there... just no links to real data.
   If it helps, I think I know what casued it.  The drive (ST225) was
being used with a 16 bit WD-1003 MFM controller.  When the computer died
the drive was moved to a different machine with a SEGEATE contoller (MFM)
ST-11M I believe.  Anyways, they told me that when they powered up the
computer, the controller said, drive appears to be uninitialized.. do you
wish to prepare it?  THey answered NO and the machine went to the floppy
and booted, but I think this 'disk interrogoation' by the seagate board
may have been what fried the FAT tables.
   I am still waiting on word as to whether there was any valuable data
on the drive that must be recovered, but with this info in hand, is there now e
now any new possibilities of recovery?
No dup. chars.
