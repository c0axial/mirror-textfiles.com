to ED FOSTER re: R/SCALABLE FONTS

  Wow!  I've never heard of scaleable fonts being built into the
printer so you can just send ascii like that - especially a dot matrix!
  Is there a windows driver for it so if you wanted to do some low-end
desktop publishing, you could?
  Thanks!
  Thanks also for the CBBS reply.  It would have to be "C" for portability
(well...) to chinet, a Unix system.

to BILL WOLFF re: R/CP/M ON COMMODORE 64

If you haven't found help elsewhere, post a msg over on The Advocate
(312.939.4411). Several C-64 users or former user there.

Msg 45360 is 14 line(s) on 12/20/91 from JERRY OLSEN
to WARD re: SYSTEM()

Actually system()--or a couple of other, compiler-specific fxns which
might offer some advantages--**does** sound appropriate, based upon
the scenario you mention.
        It would work something like this....Upload the new version of
CBBS with the current password protection. Then, shell to DOS with
system()--of course again with password--to do your renaming and such.
And finally, have one more passworded routine to reboot (after the
then-current version of CBBS does any appropriate housekeeping). At
that point, you would call back to test the new version.
        Assuming the new version doesn't utterly crash <G>, you could
use its own system() routine to rename things back if desired--without
bothering Randy to do so.
        Happy holidays to you and all. I'm outa here for a few days to
escape from the computers, phones and editors. <GGG>

  I'm looking for some RAM chips. (DIPs?)
  I need (36) 1M x 1  80 ns chips for a Micronics memory board. Any
one selling cheap chips? I saw them listed in a catalog for $5.99.

A number for early evenings for chips:  312-775-2593.
