to MIKE REINHART re: R/HELP ON CRC

  Call the Ward Board CBBS - (708) 849-1132, (up to 2400 baud) and check
out the low numbered messages - do an "s" (or "o" for one line summary)
from message 1, and I think msg 7 or 8 or 9 or some small number, contains
a CRC routine for computing the XMODEM  CRC.  It won't really show you the
math, because you really should see the "hard way" to do it - which is
shifting, exclusive-oring, etc; the one on the Ward Board is a table-
driven one - enormously faster computations that doing it via shifting, etc.

to ALL re: CUBS BEATMETS/ SWEEP SERIES

The Cubs beat the Meyts 7-2 last night, to the disgruntled heckles of bitter
Mets fans. Andre Dawson smote his 19th homer of the year, and as he raced
around the bases, one could not help but believe that the tide had turned,
thatthe Cubs had somehow pushed themselves back into the NL east race.THEY
ARE ONLY 9-1/2 GAMES BACK, but only 3 games out ofthird place. Tonight the
Cubs face Philly, a tougher team than many give them credit for. Meanwhile
the Mets battle the Pirates in Shea. An exciting NL east battle awaits....
Last night FRANK CASTILLO pitched his third complete game of theyear, giving
up only 2 runs in 9 innings. Watch out NL east.
No dup. chars.
