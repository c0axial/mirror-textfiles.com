You know, Bill, DOS keeps convenient records of all that stuff -- in
fact, a Master Boot Record.  There are all kinds of ways for software
running under "remote control" to find out things.  Just look at other
commercial products such as Remote, Carbon Copy, et al.  I wouldn't
let one of those slimy pieces of ka-ka *touch* my machine.

As for the legality of the so-called contract, it probably just hasn't
been challenged in court yet.  I'm pretty sure IBM, Sears, etc. would
lose a resounding defeat if somebody with some big-time legal pull
fought them on invasion of privacy grounds.  This does smack of 1984
though, doesn't it?  Keep on your toes, dude.

  you could call the local zenith dealership
in skokie ( on dempster ) for the upgrading
of the chips.  the user manual for the 151 pc
is called the zenith 100's series manual.

the rca/phone jack  and the 9 pin  are for the
ttl monochrome display.   a color monitor and
hard drive could be attached, but it would be
rather expensive and may not be worth the
upgrade ( the "8080" processor is rather slow ).

the switch on the ttl mono card must be disabled
and a color card installed into the machine.

i truly think you should trash the machine!

        bye.

           ala.

i looking for excellent reference

does anyone know where i can purchase

Well, I don't believe in trashing working machines.  I figure that
I can have a decent writing machine for $300, tops, and that beats
what I have now (a Kaypro CP/M machine, nice as it is, is hard to
add a hard disk to!).  I know all about the 88/86/286/386/etc
business -- but, again, this is better (for what I want to do) than what
I have now.  I appreciate the info on the video card -- I take it
I can just plug a mono monitor into the 9-pin port; I abhor color screens
of all types (also graphical interfaces, etc), so that makes life a
little easier.  And since I can get 256K of chips for $15 or so, I guess
that might be worth a try as well.  I can always add in an expansion
card if it doesn't work.

Besides all this, the 151 has one of the best keyboards of any MS-DOS
machine I've ever used; I know I can move it to another box, but it
has this one attached.

So, unless you have a 286 or 386 (SX optional) to give away, I think
I'll probably bring this 'handyperson special' up to speck.  BTW, I
live in upstate NY -- I moved from Chicago some time ago!

Dear Murray! Well I must say your a real ray of sunshine for me in this
area of engineering. You see, I used to service and operate electron
microscopes for 9 years. Really, an electron microscope is nothing more
than a complex CRT in many ways. We had various ways to evaluate the
microscope to provide a vacuum to operate an electron gun which beamed a
small sample with electrons and magnified (or projected) the image on a
fluorescent screen. Getter (or we called them Ion Getter Pumps) is nothing
new to me. It was possible to get about 1x10 -10 torr for a vacuum. Our
filaments were easily replaced in about 5 to 10 minutes tops. 1x10 -4 torr
was about the least amount of vacuum one could have without blowing out
filaments daily. Though normally one would never want to operate in that
range, if one could avoid it. What does this have to do with CRTs?

Well with tubes in general, you have a metal silver looking area which is
generally a round matter attached (Is this shadow mask?) to the inside of
the glass. I was told that this was a getter and fired up when the tube
was new to create a stronger vacuum. Afterwards though it has no purpose
and the only thing to maintain a vacuum was the heater burning up any
oxygen it finds inside. It appears that you maybe telling me something
that makes a lot more sense. Are you maintaining that CRTs (and perhaps
other types of tubes) maintain a vacuum by a getter action while powered
up? If so, do you have any idea about what the vacuum (sometimes they call
it pressure nowadays) would likely operate around? Measurements in Torr or
Pascal would likely be very helpful to me. Anyway, thanks for the already
enlightened information you have provided us. Of course, I've found the
information very informative.

Yes MS-DOS can check on Prodigy's action if needed. Though it appears to
this reader that Prodigy has gone way out it's way to prevent any type of
software learning anything that Prodigy software is up to. This simple
action on their part only fuels suspicion that they are only hiding
something. They have done other suspicious things which has created their
intriguing position. They have gone out of their way to targeted the naive
group while keeping the knowledgeable in disbelief. Another perfect of an
example of controlling the masses. Now when the smoke clears, this may
simply turn out to be one of the best marketing strategies known to man.
With all this attention just fueling their success.

I predicted that Prodigy would flop within a year. It certainly appears
that I must now eat those words and say that they are still maintaining one
million subscribers. I certainly didn't expect that many naive people using
computers and having a modem at the same time. Well... all I can say is...
I was wrong! Sorry. I guess it's true about what they say: a fool born
every minute. Though I am not implying that all users of Prodigy are fools,
just that some maybe misled by Prodigy's use of censorship to gain more
support. After all, I am currently using Prodigy to review their new
software version called 3.1. and at their expense too.

to BILL WOLFF re: R/CRT LIFETIMES

Your info regarding the flashed getter is largely correct.  The getter is
active even when the tube is off.  Tube pressures range from 10-8 to 10-9 torr
in most good tubes.

Msg 44924 is 07 line(s) on 06/30/91 from MURRAY ARNOW
to BILL WOLFF re: R/CRT LIFETIMES

Sorry, forgot to answer the shadow mask question. The shadow mask is next to
the glass screen opposite the gun end of the tube. You normally can not see
the mask because there is a conductive coating on the tube funnel which blocks
the view.  The getter is usually mounted near the gun and is positioned to
direct the barium towards the screen end of the tube when it is flashed.
If this isn't done and conductive barium gets around the gun elements, there
will be arcing and all sorts of fireworks.

The Z-151 is a 4mhz 8088 machine.  It has at least 2 major
configurations that I know of.  The 1st had a CPU card, and dual
floppy and video card with a parallel port.  The video ist NOT
monochrome, it is CGA with a DB9 for RGB and a RCA Jack for
composite video.  The best upgrade is to find a AST six pack or
simular product to expand the memory.  You can contact Heathkit in
St Joseph Mich and get the hardware tech support to give you
atitional options.  And you are right about te keyboard it still is
the best and most reliable made.

I have two Northstar computers (remember them?) for sale.
The first is the all-in-one Advantage.  It is a collectors' item.
It does not work and I can't figure out want to fix. Asking $25
plus shipping.
THe second is a two user Dimension.  This is an MS-DOS compatible machine.
Includes two mono monitors and key boards.  It requires a new
hard drive, more memory and an operating system upgrade.
Asking $100 for the main unit; $50 for each of the work stations.
Plus shipping.  This is an excellent machine for alternative to a
network.
Call Donnie Stuhlman  312/743-4241 (evenings, answering machine).
