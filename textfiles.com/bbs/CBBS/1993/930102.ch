 No, not using 4DOS - instead, CED. I don't want anything "too"
different - I don't have those environments when on "other people's
machines" etc. heh.
 I don't have a deskjet on my "main" machine, but actually I DID
set up a little program to initialize the DeskJet - I put in all the
normal fonts, densities, etc, that I use, and can cursor to one and
hit space, it sends that setup. I wrote it in Pmate editor macors,
and even saved it as a custom 28K version of Pmate called FS - Font
Select. heh. When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like
a nail. When you have an EXCELLENT programmable editor like Pmate,
everything looks like an "editor" solvable problem.

to BILL MATTSON re: R/MODEM PROBLEMS

 The only thing that comes to mind on the modem problems is that at times
it seems to connect at the wrong speed. If I get a "connect 1200" then
I just hang up and call back - I get 2400 that next time and everything
works fine from there on out. It has to do with my having spent a lot
of time customizing the answer sequences for an HST, but then having the
HST die, and putting another (I think USR) 2400 modem on, which isn't
a "perfect" match.
 If it were in my house, it would be easier to work on, but being in
Chicago, it isn't.

to ALL re: NEW TOYS?

 Anyone get any new computer or electronic toys for Xmas? My Brother,
thanks to me, got a Sharp 5200 pocket memo. I broke the "whisk" that
I use for making pancakes, and asked Santa, but he gave me a rechargeable
4-"tool" electric whisk. Worked fine, heh, especially the plastic blade,
to mix up some spackling compound (grin).

Msg 45989 is 07 line(s) on 12/30/92 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to BILL MATTSON re: R/MSC 7.0 & IBM C SET/2

 Sorry, my C-SET has mostly - SET. Were you using real Windows calls?
Didn't that require an SDK? I guess Cset doesn't need the SDK, or sort
of "you can think of it as THE SDK"?
 I "panicked" and bought it before the price went up but in retrospect
dunno if I'll use it or not.
 Right now I need some ideas on cleaning up my hard disk. I've got 520M
but it is VERY cluttered - too many versions of too many programs.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/DISK CLEANUP TIP

CED - OK, but it can't do what 4DOS does! But on the other hand, you're
right. When I'm working on someone else's machine, it's a PAIN not to
have the stuff I'm used to.

The BMT file I set up for 4DOS sets up the DJ500 in a neat way (I think):
It gives you a menu for basic functions (reset to [my] defaults, set
margin, do an envelope, or choose a font). If you do 'choose a font,'
you get a drop-down menu of all the useful fonts (internal and those
in the Prestige Elite cart), and just highlight one to load it.

I really like the DJ, but HP's PCL is a royal pain at times. Order of
commands is a real big factor. Having the ability to just pick a font
off a menu makes it a whole lot easier to deal with.

I keep hearing about PMATE, BTW. It sounds nice. I use MicroEMACS
for my main editor/word processor/etc, and recently added a macro to
call a high-speed text searcher (MasterFind) and dump the search results
to a new buffer. You're right - given a good hammer.

to WARD re: RE: TOYS

I didn't get one, but I saw today a little Casio 4300 'pocket book.'
It's nice. For $69 you only get 32K, but the keyboard is good, th
the whole thing is SMALL (REALLY the size of a pocket calendar, not
a day-runner), and you can hook it up to a PC. If I had the $ right
now I think that
is the way I would go. Oh yes - the screen is quite readable, too,
and it has a QWERTY layout.

Funny, I was at an office last week where there was a big box that
said LaserJet 4M on it. When was the hold released.\

Actually got a few weeks ago, Zoom V.32bis fax-modem. Seems to work nicely,
though I haven't yet tried out the fax receiving software. A friend of
mine got a USR Sportster: the furnished software won't send out a fax
that has been received. He tried WinFaxPro, but I'm the only one who
can send him a fax from a fax machine; others have tried but the software
refuses to accept them! Zoom provided MTEZ, which seems to work reasonably
well. I used WordStar 7's fax printer driver, which has the same fonts
as a LaserJet 3. It 'prints' the file to a PCX file and MTEZ nicely
converts that to a fax. And downloading at 14.4 yields about 1600 cps
vs about 230 at 2400 (as reported by ProComm). 'Tis a joy to the
phone bill.
