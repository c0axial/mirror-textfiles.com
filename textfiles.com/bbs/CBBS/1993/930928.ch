]sysop's: glad to see you're still around. perhaps you knew Frank Mcneill,
programmer from Chicago. He was a close friend of mine who died of
cancer this year. I inherited his machine & found your # on his comm
software. I also inherited Frank's BBS (Farpoint, 312-274-6128). i've
been having problems with my software & have been looking for some
help. I'm running rbbs-pc under desqview. Any assistance you can provide
would be greatly appreciated. Please leave a message on mine if you
wanna help me tackle my problem (or refer me elsewhere). If you'd like
you can try my voice line @ 312-973-6870. I'd really appreciate any
advice you can give. Thanks again in advance.   DS

Call the IBM BBS, 919-517-0001, and find your way around - I think there
is even a command "REF DISK".

Msg 46474 is 04 line(s) on 09/24/93 from KEN STOX
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: SCSI

If memorty serves correct, SCSI-III will support more than 8 devices,
32 I believe, but it is still under debate. As far as I know, SCSI-II
still supports 8 devices ( 7, actually, since the host adapter eats up
a slot ).

Msg 46475 is 19 line(s) on 09/28/93 from MICHAEL SHARTIAG
to WARD/ALL re: IDE/LOCAL BUS REVISITED

Ward,
   I just got a chance to do a little exploring in the VESA/LB world
again.  An identical machine running standard ISA/IDE vs. VESA local
bus card in a couple of benchmarks:  Norton SI  13.6  vs 9.9
PC labs Benchmark 7.0 drive test overall rating of 47777 vs 46244
   Seems to work OK.. you get 3 modes to choose from: NOrmal, enhanced
and TUrbo.  Normal leaves system bios alone, enhanced mode, using a
new BIOS and reloacting it into RAM, and a Turbo mode that does the BIOS
swap , plus attempts multiple read / multiple write commands offered by
some of the newer IDE drives....
   NOw for some of the fun questions:  which drive manufactureres
support this new command?  DO my Seagates(ST3283A)  ??
   ANd when does thjis VESA/LB stop ??  It was for video only, then they had
2 slots.  The most recentr MB's I have seen now offer 3 VESA slots.  Will
we soon have 7 LB slots? And if so, does there come a point where they
start to interfere ( too many)  or until we get to parallel processing
only 1 card is active at a time so it doesn't matter.
        SOmething just seems wrong to be popping all of these cards
directly on the CPU.
No dup. chars.
