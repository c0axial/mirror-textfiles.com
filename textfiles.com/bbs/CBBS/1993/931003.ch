to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/CYRIX 486/40 ??

 Oh, this whole non-Intel chip thing is CONFUSING! IBM comes along with
"Blue Lightning" which I thought was a 33-100 chip, possibly without a
math-co, and possibly a 16MB-addressing machine.
 Cyrix had 386-pin-compatible 486s, I think - and also other products. This
one you talked about with the piggy-back math-co sounds strange! One of
the bennies of Intel is the internal 64-bit path to the math-co, wonder if
that is true with Cyrix?
 Have you or anyone seen any reviews of the Cyrix chips?

No, CBBS hasn't been available for quite a while. Maybe nearly 10? I
don't know. It is running here on a highly modified PC running a CP/M
emulator and V20 chip! I really SHOULD write it in C if I want it to go
on "forever", heh.
 What was the 1:3800 in your phone number? Never saw that!
