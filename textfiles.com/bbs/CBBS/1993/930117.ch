]Ward, when I tried to enter a message subject I was told
++LINE >    4 LONG etc
regardless of the length (even 8 characters), but when I
entered "FOR SALE" even though I got the same message it took
the whole subject....

I found the file for PCMANAGE. As for the TSR overhead, I don't know
what it is specifically, but the program that is loaded as a TSR is about
28k. The way the program keeps track of the last access date of the files
is by creating a file in each directory called INDEX.CMP. The program
can handle 100 directories/files per directory/and child directories,
and allows you to specify any files (up to 100) that you don't want to
be touched by the program (config.sys, command.com, etc). It also
notes that you shouldn't compress any OS/2 files (system ones, I believe).
The archive is fairly small, about 36k zipped. I'll upload it to your
directory on Chinet.

to ALL re: WHY DO 486'S GET HOT?

A fellow I know says that 486 DX2s run at better than 200 degrees
Fahrenheit. I'm curious as to what specifically causes a chip to
generate heat, given a fixed operating voltage. Is it due to the
narrowness of the interconnections between the transistors? Is it
due to the number of transistors? Is it due to the speed of
the on/off switching of the transistors? (Perhaps a better question
is, How much is due to each of these factors, and how much is due
to others.)

to ROY LIPSCOMB re: RE: WHY DO 486'S GET HOT

The newer generation of CPU's run hot for two reasons:
 1) Speed, the faster you switch, the more heat you generate.
 2) There are Xx10e6 components in a very small area.
I would think that the biggest factor is a function of both, but
really is just of function of speed, since that is also a
driving factor towards smaller sizes.

Msg 46025 is 12 line(s) on 01/14/93 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/WHY DO 486'S GET HOT?

 It is due to the number of transistors and the speed of on/off switching.
The technology is probably CMOS, which means "Complimentary Metal Oxide
Semiconductor". Unlike traditional transistors, MOS means that there is
an insulator (the oxide) between the controlling signal and the Input
and output signals. Like a capacitor, it is inherently an AC device,
in that electrons get pushed into one side of the capacitor, but don't
cross the insulating barrier. When you turn it off the electronc go
back out, when you turn it on again, they get pushed in again, etc.
Like DC resistance causing heat, all these electrons moving around cause
heat. The big difference is that speed is totally related to the heat -
if you clock the chip at 2mhz, it might take forever to get something
done, but a 486 would run quite a bit cooler.

Msg 46026 is 10 line(s) on 01/14/93 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to BENJAMIN COHEN re: R/FOR SALE

 All I can think of the problem you had entering your message is that you
put one too many fields in the input line. The syntax for expert users
is l;whoto;subject;password but if you stuck in one too many "fields",
as I did in this by putting in "whatever", you are then putting the subject
into the password field. You gave me the clue when you said "> 4 long"
because that's the length (4) of the password field:
>Function:?e;all;whatever;for sale
Msg 46026
+LINE > 4 LONG - truncated, return to ACCEPT, ^U to RE-ENTER:

to ALL re: REQUEST HELP - VISUAL 102

I am trying to get a VISUAL 102 TERMINAL to send data
out to an OKIDATA printer. Does anybody know of:
where I can get hold of a VISUAL 102 Manual with port
specs, or does anybody locally still use Visual 102
( I already tried IIT ), or does anybody know if the
company still exists and where it is?
Any help will be aprreciated.
