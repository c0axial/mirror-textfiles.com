to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/PROBLEM WITH 20 MHZ 286

Andy, as you surmised, the problem was the keyboard. The AMI bios I
have works fine if I boot with a friend's 101-key keyboard (set to AT mode).
(The odd thing is that, with the 84-key keyboard, the AMI bios recognized
the ESC key but not the DEL key. I thought those were two of the keys
that had the same scan codes on the 101-key as on the 84-key.)

Now all I have to do is get a 101-key keyboard.

Glad it worked! Once you get used to the 101 key layout (which DOES take
a while) you won't want to give it up. Just make sure you get a good
one (I like the NMB technologies keyboards, myself).
