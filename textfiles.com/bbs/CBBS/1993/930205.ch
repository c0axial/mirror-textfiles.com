Msg 46050 is 15 line(s) on 02/04/93 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to TONY ANTONUCCI re: LAPTOP

 I didn't get one. The IBM Personal Computer company switched from
paying for 500 marketing folks in the big-companies marketing organization,
to 150. I went to the class filling in for one of the 150, who was on
here honeymoon. I won't be getting a machine unless I buy it myself, or
unless they work out something at the company. This is my 25th year,
and I'm supposedly getting a fancy Rolex, which I would probably look at,
and go "hmmm, I like my 5-alarm, 20-phone number $39 Casio better" and
lock it up in the safety deposit box.
 SO, mebbe they'll "chip in" for a laptop, heh.
 The only thing I could think of would be to pre-arrange with Barnaby's
for a place to put a desktop machine, perhaps I could bring my DeskJet
(or someone could bring a small laser).
 Oh, come to think of it, a guy I drive to Elgin with now and then was
asking about the Fotoman. That's the tall skinny (thin) camera, B/W?
 P.S. what the heck IS a "RAVE" party?
