Msg 46051 is 03 line(s) on 02/06/93 from JOSEPH SKOM
to ALL re: CALLER ID WITH RS-232 OUTPUT

 I was wondering if anyone makes a Caller ID box that sends output
through an RS-232 to be read by a PC/terminal. My company buys 8-line
boxes, but I need a single-line box for home use. Any ideas?

Msg 46052 is 13 line(s) on 02/08/93 from BENJAMIN COHEN
to ALL re: NORTHGATE SUPPORT??!

I've always loved Northgate keyboards and we have three of them in the
office. Alas, last Friday one of them locked up and won't work on any
system. [This morning I schlepped a keyboard from home, and until I have
a replacement I'll be carrying one back and forth daily.] So this morning
I called Northgate. I guess Monday at almost noon is a bad time to call.
After I waited a minute or so someone came on the line to tell me that
there is a 25 minute wait and my options were (1) wait and (2) call back
later. I told her I'd buy my replacement keyboard somewhere else. Perhaps
I'll just send a letter requesting an RMA#; the keyboard has a five year
warranty and should be under warranty (though I can't remember the
purchase date off hand). Sigh. This is support? What ever happened
to Northgate? Losing too much money to provide any help? Not even an
excuse.

Hi Ward and Randy,

I am writing a term paper on BBS'es and would appreciate it if either one
of you have time to answer a couple <G> of questions for me.

History of CBBS? What do you think of BBS'es today versus when you guys
started? What are you doing now? Geez, I'm having a brain fade.

Um, really anything you think would be helpful to know about boards.
Oh, yeah, one other question, how would you define a BBS?

Thank you in advance for the help!

Traci

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: LAPTOP

I have 2 laptops, but neither is capable of running windows. I agree the
Rolex would be a waste on me too. I have a nice dress watch ($200 Seiko)
and that is fine, for pilot activities an LCD with stop watch and 2 time
zones (about $20 cost) is perfect.
Yes, the fotoman is the tall skinny camera B/W. But it does a fine job
I have my eye on a Microtek scanner later this year.
A RAVE party.I have no idea.I was asking the same thing.
See ya Sat.
P.S. If we can not get a Windows compatible laptop (or desktop) there, I
can shoot 32 pictures and put them on my BBS for downloading (only thing
I can think of).
