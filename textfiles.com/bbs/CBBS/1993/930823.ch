]Ward, Did you miss Andy Shapiro's msg of Monday (16th) just after
you left?  He was evidently looking for a flash on Wednesday and
Thurdsay (short calls).  You called immediately after his Thursday
call and could have missed his msg if you didnt go all the way
back in tghe log.  I saw no "flash recvd" either.

Msg 46431 is 15 line(s) on 08/19/93 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/PROBLEM WITH 20 MHZ 286

Any chance it could be an enhanced keyboard - looking for the del key
that's not part of the numeric pad? At first it sounded like the KB was
bad but like you say ESC worked. Hmmm.
 The AT disk controller could be too slow for the motherboard - go into
SETUP and see what you can do (he said, with frustration on his mind,
knowing SETUP doen't work!).
 How about completely pulling the hard disk controller, and booting a
floppy? It might give you a 1701 error (Hard disk controller failure)
but might let you boot the diskette. "maybe" you could somehow figure how
to get into setup (like by poking around the ROMS in DEBUG).
 You say you have an EVEN and a KB ROM. Sounds like you should have
an even and an odd. BUT the fact that the msgs come out OK ("Press DEL
to run setup"), you should be OK.
 I presume you have a 1.2M drive, right? I have some "extra" 360 1/2 hi
5.25"ers around here if that would help.
