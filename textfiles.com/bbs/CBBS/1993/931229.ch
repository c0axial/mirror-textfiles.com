There are now commercially available alkaline rechargeables, so it can't be
too difficult. The chargers aren't expensive, and I suppose you could
take one apart to see what makes it click!

Ward,
 I was scanning old messages here and noticed that in September you
were asking about some information you had picked up on using X.25 for
multiple-line BBSes. In case you never got any information:

 I've seen some information in the Telecom Digest on the Internet
lately about this. Apparently a number of companies, including U.S.
Robotics, make devices that will attach to T-1 circuit(s) from the local
phone company and supply an X.25 interface. [A T-1 circuit in this
context supplies 24 voice circuits - an equivalent digital bandwidth of
56kb for each. T-1 circuits are frequently used for connections between
the local phone companies and company-owned PBX equipment.]

 The normal way to connect modems to phone lines coming through a T-1
circuit would be to connect the T-1 into a Channel Bank, which would
then break the circuits out into 24 4-wire phone lines. You would then
hook individual modems into each of those lines. Apparently these
devices you heard of "pretend" to be modems to the 24 voice circuits and
present the data to individual SVCs (Switched Virtual Connections) over
an X.25 link.

 These products are probably targeted to companies that have mid-sized,
or larger, mainframes. Most Unix mainframe manufactuers offer software
and hardware to handle X.25 connections. I'm quite sure that other,
propriatary mainframes can handle X.25 on their front-end processors.
(I have an X.25 port at work on one of my front-ends for the Unisys
A-Series mainframes I support, and another one on a U6000 Unix box.)
If you can't support X.25 directly (because, for instance, you have a
LAN-based BBS system) an alternative would be to plug a multi-port X.25
PAD into the above-mentioned equipment. This could then break out the

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: X.25=MULTI LINES (CONT.)

SVCs into individual serial connectors (optioned as DCE ports) that
would appear to be modems to the serial ports of the PCs.

 As I said, I just heard about these devices recently. I've been
meaning to contact USR about them. I'd be glad to pass on any
information I get.
