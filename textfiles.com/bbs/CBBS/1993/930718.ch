 Does the Geneva execute a basic? i.e. does it come with one? I might
be interested - it WAS a system I had considered at one point. Besides,
my 10-year-old-laptop died! (Epson HX-20 - GREAT early machine - tape,
printer, screen, BASIC, etc. Problem with it, was that it could have
been a great "hackers" machine but they refused to release the internals
documentation until it was a dead product.

I was fiddling around with the program that works with Filink on the
Geneva, and for some reason or other it wouldn't work consistently. Since
there's still an Osborne Exec about arm's length from here, I never bothered
to fiddle with other stuff. That connection works reliably. Most of
the time the stuff that I'm doing can be quickly edited on the Exec and
then printed and that's all I need from it! Actually, for that kind of
work the machine is still quite good - 8 MHz CPU and 385K RAM disk make
for plenty fast editing and it has DSDD drives and can copy the finished
work to an IBM-compatible format disk.

It's simply a matter of having a method that works well and not having
the energy to figure out a substitute. The Exec isn't going away and it's
still quite good for writing letters and stuff. It's even "green" (uses a
lot less energy than my 486!).

Sure, it has BASIC in ROM. The base machine is 64K, of which about 24K
can be configured as a RAM disk. You can add on a "wedge" under the base
machine. It may be (a) a 300 baud modem, (b) a 120K RAM disk, or (c) a
"multi" unit, with 64K RAM disk, 300 baud modem, and an additional ROM
slot. The base machine has two ROM slots. There's a utilities ROM,e
WordStar, Portable Calc, BASIC, and some other stuff. Parallel port,
serial port, etc. I dunno what Randy has, but I have a spare 300 baud
modem wedge just waiting for the first hungry buyer! Oh, yes, there is
a tape drive, as well.

to ALL re: FAX CLASS 1 VS 2

I have been 'excercisng' my new fax mode. It is 14.4K fax & data.
I have had problems connecting with serveral standard fax machines as
well as other fax/ modems. The majority of the problems went away when
I changed from a Class 2 fax to a Class 1 fax although the software
documentation said to use class 2. The modem users guide and the
software did not give even a 1 line explaination of the different
classes. I have also checked one other manual. Can someone enlighten me?

 IN order to operate under Windows properly I had to use a new COMM
driver in system.ini, ortherwise it would not keep up.
 I was able to send dta to this standard fax machine, but could not
receive a fax from it.
It is about 2 years old, and is a G3 fax machine (a small unit) Any
idea as to why this is happening?
