 What do you think I should do - should I check with the current CACHE
officers to see if they "OK" using the old list? Do you want to take
part of the list? Actually, I may have one on 8" disk, and by moving
some hardware around I might be able to actually read it!

Msg 46031 is 09 line(s) on 01/17/93 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to WARD re: PIZZA PARTY LIST

I imagine they would not object to your using the list for that
purpose. I also have a feeling that it would be at least courteous
to get such permission, since the list actually is the property of
CACHE. But my original thoughts were that CACHE might run a note in
their newsletter, for the old timers or for anyone, as you deem best;
and that perhaps CACHE would provide an updated list for those old
timers who are still around. For my part, I guess I was offering to
call a subset of old timers on the list; but maybe postcards would be
less work. What do you think?

to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/PIZZA PARTY LIST

 I ran into a current cache member on America Online, and I wrote a
little piece for him to do - either just bringing up in the meeting,
or put in the newsletter, so we're at least somewhat "covered" in that
area.
 Dunno about post cards vs calling.I guess selfishly I'd like to
contact the folks I REMEMBER - but I'll bet there would be familiar faces
whose name I'd not associated with it.

Most terminals have SERIAL hookups for printers, so, unless you have
an unusual Okidata (most are parallel) yer outa luck. If you DO have
a serial printer, I'd try seeing if there is a SETUP (usually activated
by pressing a SETUP key and possibly a shift key) that turns the printer
on. This terminal PROBABLY emulates a VT-102, so a Digital Equipment
manual might be useful - also, VAXen can print to a printer-equipped
terminal with the PVT command. Sorry this isn't more help.
