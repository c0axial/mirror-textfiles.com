]Ward, yes and thanks.  I recall that you did respond with the info
on
the "tail" -- which I used to use occasionally a couple years ago
to check for the most recent Kills.  Don't recall if you explained
the reason, as you do this time.  Ah, yes, now I remember, I had
tried to use "tail-n" sted of "type-n" and wondered what had gone
wrong. heh.

Hope this will get you started in what you want to do. I would make ONE
suggestion, before you purchase a voice board, sit down an write out
your script and sub-menus. Once you have that down pat, sent it to
the distributor or company and have them verify that their product
will do what you want. Otherwise, you may have just purchased an
expensive answering machine!
Best of luck, you have just entered the world ofIVR.

to ALL re: 68000 FRIMWARE?

Looking for a simple monitor for a processor. I am not sure
were to look for such an animal. The monitor sould be able to
read an write character from a RS232 port via SIO. The monitor
sould be able to get around some memory, and should be able
to be able to other useful things necessary for micro development
I would like to buy the source code. Code should be written in
68000 assembler. The processor being used will be a 68008.
thank you. Please leave a repy on this bbs.

Sorry to hear that the program isn't quite up to what you need. When I'd
gotten it, I'd played with it for a bit, then tucked it away. The concept
is a good one.too bad the execution isn't as great. Does the search
continue? :-)

I'll give you some frimware (sic).but seriously, folks - there is a
publication entitled MACSbug 1.3 INITIALIZATION AND I/O ROUTINES, and
M68KMBUD(D2), dated January 1980, second edition, which is probably
where you should start. It's a facinating little tome consisting almost
entirely of commemted 68000 assembler. The intro states the following:
"This document provides all initialization and utility routines within
MACSbug. The listing provides the user with insight into actual machine-
level programming for the MC68000 microprocessor, and the various service
routines used during operation of the MACSbug monitor ROM." A Motorola
publication of 41 pages. P.S. that is all one title up there, the part
after the 'and' appears to be some sort of document number. Hope this
helps. By the way, I am the proud owner of a 6-Megahertz 68000, in a
ceramic DIP, no less. still in it original little plastic box. WOW!

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/MF COBOL

"Downsizing" seems to mean using a computer that was smaller than
the one you started on. THe next question is "What does smaller
mean?" MF Cobol can create any kind of screens from character based
mono main frame screens to GUI based, multicolored PC based screens.
THe same program can use used for both interfaces.
MF COBOL is a strong tool form downsizing since the same code can
be used on multiple platforms (Main frame, PC, UNIX, DEC & more).
MF Cobol's strength is in it's ability to run on many computers
without changing the source (except for file locations and other
"local" considerations.)

In the Business section of Sunday's Trubune there was an ad
that including a voice mail product. THe cost was about $164.
I think it was on page 2 on the bottom half of the page about
38 cm from the left margin.

to ALEX ZELL re: R/CBBS NOT RETIRING

Ward mentioned something in an earlier message about CBBS having
become "boring," and led me to believe that he was not longer
going to support it (i.e. take it down). Glad to see there
probably was a misunderstanding on my part. I guess I didnt'
need to remind Ward that if he didn't want to spend time
maintaining CBBS, there would be plenty of others who would
be glad to serve as s*ops. (Thanks for reminding me that this
is a family board!)

Do you have the "C"BBS project mapped out yet? And/or farmed out?
I still have the phone number of the fellow who offered you some
low-level routines.
