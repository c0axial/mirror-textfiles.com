to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/THE WRITTEN RECORD

 Gee, did they even spell my name right?
 I was talking to a lady friend the other "year" and she had just
started working at Microsoft, and said they had this cool huge database
they could search. "OH, lets look you up in it!". I suggested "No, lets
not, lets look up a WRONG spelling, like "Christiansen" or something. Sure
enough, found 2 hits, on XMODEM. Heh.
 I DO admit I do occasionally look in a book - looked in "computer Jargon"
the other day, it had Xmodem, but no derivation.

to ALL re: SCSI TAPE SOFTWARE

I have recently come into a nice SCSI based tape backup unit. I have
even found several manufacturers that sem to use this drive. The problem
is that I don't really want to spend $800 or so for the software !
Is there a generic type program out there that will let me use this ?
 Central points product Back-it-up (or something) works with all
QIC 40/ 80 tapes. Is there a product out there that supports SCSI ??
dup. chars.
