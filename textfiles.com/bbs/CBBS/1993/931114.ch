Msg 46506 is 10 line(s) on 11/09/93 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ABU BAKAR re: R/GOOD CONNECTION

 Yes, I wrote CBBS, originally in '78. Mods thru early 80s, then
"frozen". So a trip here is like a ride in a Model T, heh.
 What is a "quoting system"? Heaven forbid people pulling quotes from
other messages! They shouldn't be so lazy - I could pull an entire paragraph
from your msg or say "Quoting system?" and get the point across. No, there
are no changes planned for CBBS, that would cease having it be historical.
 I have no idea how many users. Not many. The user database keeps track
of the last 1000 callers, and many go back months if not years. CBBS has
only a couple hundred calls a month. Kind of tempted to just pull the plug,
but folks @ BBSCON say the first system should keep going.

Msg 46507 is 18 line(s) on 11/11/93 from RICHARD PAQUETTE
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: INVITATION

Ward.

I am publisher of BBS Callers Digest Magazine soon to be called
BBS Magazine. I think that you meet my partner John Carcione at
One BBScon two years ago at Fred Clark's Dinner/Party. Well we are
sponsoring our first annual BBS EXPO in April 94 in Washington DC and
would like to discuss with you the possibility to have you as a Guest
Speaker.

If possible. could you call me at: 609-953-9110 (10am to 4pm EST) or
at: 609-231-1757 up to 11pm est. If not; could I get a voice number
to contact you?

Will check back here later today for a reply. thanks

 Richard Paquette, Publisher - BBS Callers Digest
