to MURRAY ARNOW re: VOICE BOARDS

 Do you really want to keep a system on all day for the functions that
you could get out of a cassette-based recorder that would cost less?
 I used a Watson board, and it was "fun", but one day I came home to -
wish this were an AUDIO BBS - a roooooowwwwer from the drive - bearings
going out because of running it all the time. SURE, you can run a BBS
all the time, but an answering machine might be the kind of application
that a computer is overkill for.

to MURRAY ARNOW re: R/VOICE MAIL

Quite a few advertisements have crossed my desk for PC based voice
mail. I have never seen one in action. I think one name is the
Complete PC.

Msg 46153 is 07 line(s) on 03/16/93 from DONNIE STUHLMAN
to ALL re: LAPTOP OR NOTEBOOK WANTED

Does anyone want to sell a cheap laptop or notebook computer.
I need one for the summer and I don't want to spend more than
$500. It needs only a 286 microprossor and a 20 meg HD. It must be
able to operate over seas on 220 volts.
Thanks,
Donnie Stuhlman
