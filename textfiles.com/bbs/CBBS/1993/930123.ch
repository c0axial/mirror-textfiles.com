Msg 46038 is 03 line(s) on 01/19/93 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to BOB SULLIVAN re: R/VISUAL TECH INC?

 I've got a HUGE list of a BUNCH of companies - not maybe like the
CD-ROM one, but all I've got is Visual Business Systems,(404) 956-0325,Voice
and - heh heh - THEY might have heard of the OTHER "visual", but probably not.

Msg 46039 is 02 line(s) on 01/20/93 from BENJAMIN COHEN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/SPEECH INPUT?

I've heard good thinngs about Dragon Dictate, but it's a bit
expensive still!

Msg 46040 is 07 line(s) on 01/20/93 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to KEN STOX re: RE: MODEM PROBLEM

The modem initialization string is !ATZ &C1 &D2 S0=0 S7=8!
Makes no difference if I use &D0 or &D2, or leave off the initial "!".
A friend (whose modem this is) says she has the same problem dialing
out with a non-Procomm program; likewise, if she exits from the
program and then reinvokes it, she has greater success in getting
connected. (Her program is a dedicated application, and gives only sparse
clues as to what's happening with the line or modem).
