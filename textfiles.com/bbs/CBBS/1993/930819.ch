]Ward, I lost your address.  I have the modem wedge/RAM disk for the
Geneva, but I can't send it out without somewhere to send it!! FLASH
it to me again (will call on wednesday PM) and I'll send it off.  No
additional charge, this is part of the Geneva and so it's included
in
the original price...

AS I have been shopping around for SCSI cards, compatibility with
Corel SCSI seems to be a selling point.  I know they have Corel draw,
but can anyone shed some light on Corel SCSI, why one would need it if
your card ( assume ADAPTEC) comes with software?

What is the commonest cause of a floppy drive ceasing to be usable?
I have one that obeys commands to home the head, etc., but has no
effect other than to cause a "Bad sector" message.  Is there a
particular component or connector that appears to be a weak point
on 5-1/4" drives?  (The one I have in mind is a Toshiba, model FD5022.)

The biggest failure I find is in the hub assembly getting nicked or
slighly out of alignment and the doors won't pop open , leaving the
disks stuck in.
   Drawing on experience from back when it was worth fixing drives,
I found most failres to be in the head itself.  A wire would be overwrapped
or the fwrrite would be cracked and over timethrough vibration, and aging
of the epoxy that this would trigger a failure.  I was able to fix a couple
with tweezers, steady hands and a very small soldering iron.
   one other quicky:  use standard cassette head cleaning solution on the
drives heads and try demagnitizing them...

Thanks for your response.  I've already tried q-tips and alcohol.
I'll see if I can find my old tape-recorder head demagnatizer.
As for broken wires, I did check the continuity of the top head's
wires.  I'm not sure if I can get at the lower head's.

to ALL re: PROBLEM WITH 20 MHZ 286

    I recently bought a 20 MHZ 286 motherboard.  But when I swapped
it into my true-blue IBM AT (6 MHZ) computer, it wouldn't
recognize the disk drives.  It would access the A drive, then
(half second later) the B drive, then got stuck in a loop trying
to reset the C drive.  The video and the keyboard appeared to
operate normally, with one exception:  The screen said "To run
SETUP, press DEL", but pressing DEL produced no result.  (The
screen also said "Press ESC to bypass memory test," and
pressing ESC did abbreviate the memory test.)
    Does anyone have any idea what the problem might be?  Might
the AT disk controller be too slow for this motherboard?
    Also, does anyone have any docs on this board and its jumper
settings?  There is no brand name stenciled on the board, but
the words "PC Chips" appear on a chip that's the same size
as the 286 chip nearby.  The BIOS is from AMI, copyright 1988;
one of the BIOS ROMS says "286 EVEN BIOS" and the other says
"KEY BOARD BIOS".  The number PCB9060D is stenciled on the
back of the board.
    Thanks for any help or suggestions you can give.

to ALL re: NCR/SCSI DRIVES 7 ME.

I came across a 40 MEG SCSI drive fro a MAC.  I jumpedered it for an
open SCSI port adress and installed it into a NCR 386SX/20 Micro Channel
computer.  I ran several of the programs, etc. that came with the PC, and
formatted the drive.  The Drives reported their correct sizes of 46 meg
and 40 meg ( correct figures)  The 46 was the C drive, dos 5.0 and was all
one partition, and it was there.
  WHen I went to fdisk the new drive (D), all it said was possible was 33
MEG ( almost like I was in DOS 3 or something).  I looked at the table
on C and it was fine, and full and 46 MEG.
    Did I miss something here?  THis is only my 2nd or 3rd venture into
the world of SCSI drives.
