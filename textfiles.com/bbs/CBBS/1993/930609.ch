to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/NEED VGA TO NTSC OR RGB
 Ah! In my new technique with Computer Shopper - I call it "Read-And-Rip",
I DID rip out the pages that have the VGA-TO-NTSC converters.
 Company name is "Publishing Perfection".
 Product is JOVIAN LOGIC's VIN Plus - External box VGA to NTSC: $298.
(Hmmm, at that price, I might get one!)
 Company is at 800-782-5974. (800-Publysh) heh.
 Hey, THIS is rare - they're in my home state - Wisconsin - 414-255-7600!
Fax -9640. No address given - "Wisconsin" mentioned because the 800 # isn't
apparently valid in Wisconsin.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/COMPUTER CHRONICLES
 The question was what was it Ward Christensen and Randy (I forgot his last
name and erased the tape) established in (date)? No one had a clue on the
two pannels. I was not impressed by their knowledge of the trivia this
time. The people are interesting in a very strange way.

to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/FAN CLUB :-)

Radio Shack uses a termister in their puters: part# DBT103J-U.
Their fan turns on when the disk drive is going.

to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/QQ: <PAUSE> KEY SCAN CODE?

The scan code for key 126 (pause) is only seen by the BIOS. It is:
 E1-1D/
 5-E1/
 9D-C5

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: IBM SOUND BOARD

Ward:

 I was reading about a new IBM product called Audio Solution Board.
The board is available in ISA & MCA bus versions. The board supports
MPC/2 specs w/16bit audio and smplaing rates fo 44.1KHz. The board also
supports MIDI and external jacks for headphones and speakers, a joystick
port and 4-1 sudio compression. Sound Blaster compatibility will be
added lster this summer. Do you or can you get any information on this
IBM product for me.
