 Any idea what the TSR overhead is - and how they keep track of the last
usage date of a file?
 Thanks!

 hehe, could be! Actually I have an HST that is merely in need of having
the power cord fixed, it shouldn't be that big a job. I think they use
a standard DIN, so I can "finish the Chop Job Randy started" and cut the
cord completely and see what wires go where - even with one loose wire,
4 should be OK and 1 not, so I can figure what goes where. I'll make
a note to at least put that on my to-do list! Actually, a V-32 would
be nice, too!

 I have already contacted a cache member to tell them about the 15th
anniversary. I DO have a mailing list. I should get going on it!
 Should I upload a VERY large message with all the names? I'm not
going to put the phone #'s in a public message.out of courtesy to
folks - and of course in 15 years probably about 70% of folks have moved.

Off hand, I don't remember what the overhead is, but I believe it's
fairly small. As for the date checking, I'll have to dig up the archive
and check both that and the overhead. Will get to it quickly and post
the answers next time I logon.
You're quite welcome!

I haven't heard of that particular company, but it sounds like you may have
a multi-line voice response unit. There were a lot of companies that
developed that type of technology in the 80's and a good majority of them
are no longer in business. Tahe a look at the boards with the RJ11
connectors and see if there is a vendor name, ie. Dialogic, Periphonics,
If your really intrested in finding out who made the system, find a library
that carries: Speech Technology, Inbound/Outbound (now called Call Center
Manager). These magazines normally list MFGs who mave voice type cards
for PCs and other products. Suggest you go back 3-5 yrs and start from
there. Good Luck.
