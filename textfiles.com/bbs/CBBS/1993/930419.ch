]After the last call and before this call I dialed up at 300 and
connected -- CBBS wouldn't talk.  Tried at 1200 and got some usual
garbage x~x~x~x~ and nothing else.  Now I am back to my normal 19.2
setting and CBBS connects as usual -- 2400 nice and clean. Go figure.

Msg 46210 is 21 line(s) on 04/18/93 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to NORB DEMBINSKI re: R/CONNECT OK?

 9600 is screwed up, 4800 and 7200 - I don't think I even look for 'em.
 As to logon script, I wait for the connect, then press carriage
returns until I get a CBBS text string back, wait .2 sec, send a ^K to
avoid the bulletin/welcome, watch for "1st time", then send n;ward;.
pat; pat 1i CBBS - Set up pattern 1 to wait for CBBS
pat 2i Welcome .and 2 to wait for "Welcome" (shouldn't happen)
while n put "\r" wait - Send a C/R every second until pattern matches
sleep 2 - then wait .2 seconds
put \013 - put a ^K to kill out of the wait
pat 1 "1st time" - wait for "1st time" message
pat 3 "FIRST" - Pattern for "What is your FIRST name"
pat 4 "+LINE >" - Occasional glitch from aborted prev call
wait - wait for one of the above patterns
sleep 16; - sleep 1.6 seconds
if 2 put \013;sleep 4 - if "Welcome" hit ^K sleep .4 sec
putw \025;putw \025;putw \010 - send ^U^U^U<backspace> (clear)
if 4 put "\025" - If we got at +LINE > then ^U it. (Oh: 25 = octal)
if 1|4 put "n;" - If I got a "1st time" then say no, not first time.
putw "ward;christensen. Then put my name, and other parms.
 This isn't all that readable, sorry. all the \025 type stuff is
OCTAL, so a 25 is really 2 x 8 + 5 = 21, 21st letter of alphabet is
dup. chars.
