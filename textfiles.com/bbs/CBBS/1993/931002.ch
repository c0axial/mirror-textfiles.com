]Thanks for the look see. Its been years since I've been on. Its looks
just as good as it did years ago.I use to run CBBS in the seventies
for a few years. Changed over to what was called mini-cbbs untill
you put a stop to it. I sure I wasn't the only one but you logged on
to my BBS and read me the riot act in a friendly way. Got my attention
and sent Randy $5.00 to update my copy. Do you still sell CBBS and
if so, how much? Enjoyed it and still miss having users log on to leave
message only. Stan Brohn      (1:3800/1 504 273-3116)

to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/IDE/LOCAL BUS REVISITED

 I think there might be an electrical limit to LB of 3 cards, and you
COULD have (1) video; (2) disk (IDE or SCSI) and (3) ?? Haven't heard of
any others!
 I think PCI is going to change that - that's the standard I think espoused
by Intel, for local bus. Randy Suess tells me it isn't quite as good as
local bus since it is processor-independent, and must therefore be a bit
slower than the Intel-specific local bus stuff (sounds backwards, no?).
 I just added local bus to my system, and went to a 33/66 DX2, my video
went from 12 frames/sec to 45! If doubling the clock were all I did, I'd
have 24, but I have 45, so local bus really helped (this is a DOS based
graphics benchmark).

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: 3RD LB CARD

Ward,
 Seems like we have cosmically linked systems. I found that my video
with a LB using a new generation Cirus enhanced SVGA chip outperformed
a S3 based card (ISA)
 AS for the 3rd card, it will be a network adapter (at least what I
have heard).
 As for a new INtel standard, unless they get a group together I don't
know if it will go anywhere. and who would use it if it is slower than
VESA LB ?
 And would they look for licensing fees (ala Micro-channel = dead)
Just when I thought 2 slots was the top of the world.

Msg 46478 is 07 line(s) on 09/30/93 from MICHAEL SHARTIAG
to ALL re: CYRIX 486/40 ??

Has anyone had experience with the Cyrix 486/40 ?? Apparantely, it
is a 486/sx 40 MHZ chip to start with and the math co-processor plugs
into the top of the chip ( you remove the heat sinc, plug it in and then
put the sinc back on top)?? this sounds weird, and at least froma marketing
standpoint a little deceiving. I was told it was 100% the same as an Intel,
vs. the ability to look the same. With the math co chip it it very little
difference in price.
