Has anyone had problems getting powerpoint (3.0) to work on a 386SX?
I have a co-processor and 8M ram in an older laptop ( DG walkabout)
In any case, the application will not run, yet it will run on a 486DX.

"Computer virgin" was my way of describing persons who are
encountering computers for the first time. They almost
invariably have hilarious notions about computer equipment
and how it's to be us-a few of which notions Eric pointed
out in his message.
"Viruses," on the other hand, are about as funny as a broken
leg. (Come to think of it, maybe broken fingers would be a
good reprisal for virus perpetrators. Not exactly "an eye
for an eye," but it might do.)
