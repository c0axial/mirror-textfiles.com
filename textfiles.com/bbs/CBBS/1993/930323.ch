to DAVID JOHNSON re: PCMANAGE/CLEANUP
 OK, I'm running it - let it go on my WHOLE laptop drive. It is taking
"forever" (maybe an hour?) to "test" compress every file. Seems to be
a bit buggy - things like "compression of -6%, 65020 bytes saved", so
it seems there are condx under which it will write MORE bytes in the'
process of compressing! Strange! Thus the negative compression is
mis-interpreted as a positive 16-bit integer. Yet internally it seems
to handle it OK.
 I'll let you know how it works out. "Interesting". It says 238K saved
already! Not sure which ones it found that it could compress the most.
dup. chars.
