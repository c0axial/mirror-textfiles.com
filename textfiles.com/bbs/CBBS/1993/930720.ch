]Ward:

I'll send you what I've got (captured the address).  The batteries
are NiCad, look like AA types, and I know there is information around
on how to build a replacement pack.  These are, however, pretty good
--I think I can run for about 10 hours or so on a charge, and there's
a backup that keeps things in RAM for about a month or so after that.

This one is the basic 64K RAM, divided into RAM DISK (c. 20K) and
TPA.  I'll collect all the ROMs I can, I have the power supply (a
VERY small brick) and a tape or two.

I hope you enjoy it -- I used it a LOT.  Named it Archie, after Nero
Wolf's mobile assistant.

I should get it sent off to you by the end of the week.  MY address
is:
Andrew Marchant-Shapiro
14A3 Sheridan Village
Schenectady  NY  12308
(518) 374-5459

You'll see it soon...
