to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/CBBS IN C

 Well, actually I dug around a bit more and found some C routines
that do interrupt-driven serial I/O, and I even brought up a comm
program using 'em and everything was fine.
 The decicison will be whether to do it op-sys independent, i.e. so it
could be ported to Chinet, or just "get it done on a PC".
 CBBS was down for a few days, and that provides the incentive I need
to push toward a "C"BBS.
 But with Carpal Tunnel coming on strong, I'm having to find ways to
spend my time WITHOUT a PC - or spend minimally $2K for a Dragon Systems
voice system.
 (and I wonder if you can use it while watching TV or listening to the
stereo!)

 Well, I guess managing a PC's disk space is more a matter of just
"getting organized" - such as installing new versions on TOP of old ones,
instead of in a separate dir where you then have both.
 But one problem with that, is that when you install the new version,
if there are files related to the old one that aren't needed, you don't
know that, and they just sit around.
 I guess that the answer is just to double your disk space every few
years. Lets see, from 15M in '82, to about a total of 900M now, I
should do some calc's - 60 times. Hmmm, in say 10 years. How often do
you double to get 60 times? Hmmm, need logs. 2^n = 60? n log 2 = log 60?
n = log 60 / log 2? Comes out to about 6. No, that's not it. Oh, means
it doubled 6 times, in 10 years, call it 120 months/6 times = 20 months,
so I gotta double my storage every 20 months? Heh.
 My $1299 520M drive (from about 20 months ago, come to think of it) -
now goes for, so my dealer says, about $849!
 One of my problems is I like keeping old data around - and DO read it
to index it with Magellan. SO that screws the "pcmanage" idea.
 Any other thoughts? Anyone else want to jump into this discussion?
