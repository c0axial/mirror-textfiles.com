 Sorry, not here - but I'm wondering how compatible microfocus cobol
is if you were trying to downsize - or do new applications in a familiar
environment, etc.
 I keep wondering what downsizing really means - if it means people doing
their own thing with traditional tools like spreadsheets (that used to take
mainframe cobol to calculate) or if - more likely - it almost always means
SQL, etc. Further then what language is used? And is Microfocus cobol
a possibility?
 Just curious.

Ward,
 Have you heard of any flakey problems with "long transfers' and IDE
drives with older BIOS's? I am still playing with that Toshiba 1600
trying to get a larger drive in it. I'm playing hot-potatoe (could'nt
resist) with On-Track Computer SYstems and Conner trying to figure out
what is wrong. The machine originally had a conner 20M IDE drive in it
so these hang-ups dpn't seemt o me to be IDE timing related.
 Problems include timing out (30-60 seconds) when using XCOPY to
move one partition oto the next, and installing windows will somtimes hang
up)
 On-track gave me some crap about certain conner dirves not translating
above 1024 cylinders, but I don't think it is the case. It is also hanginh
on a segate 245M drive I just tried tonight?
 ANy insight ???
dup. chars.
