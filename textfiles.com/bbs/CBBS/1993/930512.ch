to FERNANDO VALDERRAMA re: XMODEM IN C

 Sorry, I don't know. I think it would be easy to find - I'd try
Compuserve, BIX, or perhaps Gene Plantz' system - those are the three
biggest systems I know. But I've never looked for it. I did the original
in assembler.
 The "Ward Board" at 708-849-1132 has some C for the CRC routines in
the low #'d msgs like 4-5-6-7 somewhere, but not the entire protocol.
 Randy (Co-inventor of CBBS) has source on his Unix system, but I don't
think he's accepting new users right now - maybe out of disk space. If
you can get in it is in /src somewhere - rzsz (Zmodem stuff, with X and Y
modem as subsets) is in /src/unix/rzsz (but this is for a unix system).
 Chinet is at (312) 283-0559 for guest access, I think, but the logon
tonight said "no guest access" -has for about 2 days. Folks are trying
to find why. Maybe he's just in a bad mood, I dunno.

to JEFF ROSTON re: SCROLLING

Traditional ASCII ^S to stop, and ^Q to start, work fine here. Actually,
I turn any chars typed while CBBS is scrolling, into control chars, so
actually just an "S" or "s" would work. And for simplicity (and for
tradition since CP/M worked this way) another S will start it again.
 Sorry for the problems.

Ed.If the wife is to be trusted, the document will go in the U.S. Mail
Monday morning. I copied the entire text and covers so that nothing is
missing. Let me know when you get it. Sorry about the length of time,
but other stuff got in the way. Regards.

Msg 46237 is 28 line(s) on 05/11/93 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to ALL re: SHADOW RAM - TEST RESULTS

You always think things are snake oil until. I have an 'obsolete'
computer, a CompuAdd 386sx running at 25 MHz. I've hacked around with
the software about as much as I was going to, and then I remembered the
BIOS - by default, my machine uses 'shadow' RAM, and relocates system
and video BIOS to RAM. In theory, this should speed things up. In reality,
I was dubious. So I decided to run the following test.bat file:
@echo off
superpck/f
timer
cls
d \bin\util
d \bin\util
d \bin\util
d \bin\util
d \bin\util
cls
timer
(This is running under DR-DOS 6.0/4DOS, but it's basically generic).
I start out by flushing the cache and turning on a timer, then clearing
the screen and running 5 iterations of a DIR command (aliased to D) that
gives me a sorted list of approximately 91 files. Then I clear the screen
again and display the timer results. Without Shadow RAM, it took around
9.7 seconds timer to timer. With Shadow RAM enabled, just under 7.0 seconds
for the same thing. So - sometimes these things they sell you really work!
I should note that I run with BREAK OFF - putting BREAK ON added about
.2 seconds to the time.

So, if it's speed you need, THE SHADOW (really!) KNOWS!

Msg 46238 is 24 line(s) on 05/11/93 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to ALL re: FAN CLUB :-)

OK. I have an obsolete machine, on which I don't want to spend that
much more money (except, perhaps, for RAM, which has no bearing here).
It's a 386sx running @ 25MHz, and all is well and good, except for the
fan.

The fan is loud enough, and has always been loud enough, to be just a
little distracting (I used to use a CP/M machine with a RAM disk, no
fan, so I'm picky about noise).

Now, I have noticed that the air blowing out of the case is room
temperature, and there are no hot spots on the case (and none when I run
it case off, and touch chips to check).

My stupid question is - given this information, would it be reasonable
for me to disconnect the fan from its power source, and run the machine
without it? Or, alternatively, does anyone know of a thermostat that
could be installed to switch the fan on/off? I know there are power
supplies with 'variable speed fans' out there, but fitting one into
my case would cost >$100 plus labor.

Am I thinking of doing something stupid, or could I expect the machine
to continue living without a fan? I note that Radio Shack sells, or
used to sell, a machine without a fan - anyone heard anything bad on
that one?

Msg 46239 is 05 line(s) on 05/11/93 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to ALL re: QQ: <PAUSE> KEY SCAN CODE?

Can anyone tell me the keyboard scan code for the <pause> key?
(This is the single key that acts like the control-numlock
key combination.) I'm writing an TSR in which I have to fake
a press of the <pause> key. (The environment I'm serving
seems to ignore the "ctr-numlock" bit at 40:18.) Thanks.

Msg 46240 is 05 line(s) on 05/11/93 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/QQ: <PAUSE> KEY SCAN CODE?

Hmm. Neither my 4DOS help nor the SCANCODE program show anything
there, but my GUESS would be that it's right around 70. 70 is the
scancode (decimal) for the SCROLL LOCK key, another of those weird
ones, and they do seem to follow keyboard layout, so - that's what
I'd try. See what values nearly either side of 70 getcha.

I am looking for about 8 meg of 70ns Simms. Anyone know of a place that
sells SIMMS cheap?
