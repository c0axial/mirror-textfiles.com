]Ya, gotta think something about CBBS.  Maybe just move it to my house,
since the number is going to change anyway, and it isn't like there is
any listing for CBBS in the directory, etc.  I really should rewrite it
(Gee, have I ever said that before?) to make it more maintainable!

Msg 46329 is 15 line(s) on 06/14/93 from NORB DEMBINSKI
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: MESSAGE UPLOAD

Ward:

 I was able to upload my two long messages to this BBS without
having to type them in on line. I had the messages created off line and
then copied them to the Windows clipboard and then pasted them in when
the BBS was ready to accept input message lines. I had to slow down the
character pacing and line pacing quite a bit for the system to accept them
without error. Also and CR/LF that I had for line spacing threw the
system out of wack. I had to add blank characters before the CR/LF for
the system to accept the line spacing. I think that I am now able to
handle the message upload function now. This at least gives me the ablility
ability to create lengthy messages off line and then upload them to the
BBS message area. The pace that the characters are sent in, I can type
them in faster but who wants to bother with repetitive tasks, that is
what computers are for.

CBBS is the best BBS around if the metric used to define best is
signal to noise ratio!

Msg 46331 is 06 line(s) on 06/15/93 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to TOM YABLONG re: R/QQ: <PAUSE> KEY SCAN CODE?

Thanks for your response. I presume you are saying that the
"make" sequence of scan codes for the pause key is E1, 1D, and 5; and
the "break" sequence of scan codes is E1, 9D, and C5?
Incidentally, I recently came across a book called
THE PROGRAMMER'S BIBLE (or something like that) that gave the
scan codes as E1, 1D, 45. Does this jibe somehow with your reference?
