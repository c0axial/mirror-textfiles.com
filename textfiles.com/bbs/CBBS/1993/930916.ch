to ROGER ROSENQUIST re: 486 FOR SALE
 Thanks for the offer, I'm holding a 486/33 with 2-serial, parallel,
IDE, here in my hand. CBBS runs on some old piece of dung, which is about
5 times faster than needed already - remember, this is assembler, written
to run on a 2mhz 8080!
 SO appreciate the offer. Go ahead and put up an ad (though this is a lightly
used board, won't get much response).
 Be SURE to turn off CAPS LOCK, looks like you were, as we say, "SHOUTING"
when have have all caps on. Heh.

to ALL re: SCSI I & II ETC

 Anyone really understand SCSI? Or know a good article on it?
 Randy sez that SCSI is sort of async - that's how it can transfer
tape, CDs, hard disk, etc. So the drive determines the speed of xfer,
but there are "fast" SCSI drives, do you need "fast" SCSI adapters, too?
Or is there some kind of negotiation between the drive and controller?
 I noticed IBM's new 540M and 1G drives are fast scsi, but that they work
on old PS/2's, but for AT bus they need the new fast controller. (this is
strictly IBM, no talk of Adaptec, etc).

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/SCSI I & II ETC

Ward,
 I am no expert on SCSI, but there are a couple of things I do know.
First, and probably most important, all devices are block oriented.
You never request a track, head, cyclinder.
Being at a block level on all devices , transfer of data is really
transparent.
SCSI -1 I beleive is an 8 bit parallel transfer while SCSI-II
is a 16 bit data transfer.
 I see a number of similiarities between SCSI and IEEE-488 at an
operational level ( not speed)

to ALL re: TAPE DRIVE REPAIR 

I have a Wangtek tape drive that has stopeed writing properly. It reads
fine, and the 2nd (remaning drive works fine). I am looking for a local
(hopefully) service center or repair depo that can fix this thing at
a reasonable rate. By standard places for MB's , print heads, etc.
do not work on these units. Can anyone suggest a company ?
THanks.
