Msg 46041 is 14 line(s) on 01/23/93 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/RE: MODEM PROBLEM

I've had this same problem when using a generic 2400 baud internal
modem. I have it on COM4, and sometimes the port doesn't get
'turned on,' and I have to stomp on it (that is, hang up). I don't
know why this happens, but it sounds like you may have the same
situation. Now - I seem to recall that serial ports use a lot of
juice, and it may be the case that your laptop likes to keep them
shut down until it really needs them. Maybe, then, the problem is not
with the modem, but with the port?

The way I got around this was to use a little PD utility called
ATSEND. I have it send out the initialization string when the
machine boots (in autoexec.bat), and that solves the problem.

Hmmmm.can't think of anything else.

Msg 46043 is 08 line(s) on 01/27/93 from MICHAEL SHARTIAG
to AL HIGGINS re: R/HEARD OF ASC SYSTEMS

Thanks to all for the info on ASC SYSTEMS. I was able to find them.
There are actually 2 companies using ASC in their names. These boxes
were used in the early 80's by trading houses to display stock &
financial data on 5 monitors with DTMF keyboards which allowed
the user to key in which screen to display. Data came in via
serial port.
 Can anyone think of a useful purpose for this or am I looking at
some scrap metal and a re-usable case ??

Msg 46044 is 07 line(s) on 01/28/93 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to ANY SHAPIRO re: RE: MODEM PROBLEM

I've had the problem with the modem while using it on a desktop
(IBM AT). Also, I've tried sending intitalization strings via
the ECHO command in AUTOEXEC.BAT and/or just before invoking
Procomm, to no avail. Do you happen to know how to toggle DTR
on/off in software? I'd like to give that a try.

Thanks for your response.

Msg 46045 is 07 line(s) on 01/29/93 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/RE: MODEM PROBLEM

There are a couple of PD programs that will do that, but
it seems more likely that for some reason the port just
isn't set up. I'd check out the MODEM subdirectory on SIMTEL20
(assuming that you have access to the internet).

Somebody there has to have access - maybe through Randy's UNIX
system??
