 Do you get Computer Shopper? There is some company that specializes
in publishing things - scanners, etc. I recall seeing (some months ago)
an external NTSC conversion box. I think it might cost a lot more to
handle EGA (digital color) AND VGA (analog color, different frequencies,
too).
 Sorry I don't remember the name - I'll try to remember to jot it down
if I come across it again (got a new Shopper last week).
 Otherwise, Willow (Peripherals?) - Willow Ave, Bronx, NY. makes an
AT-but NTSC output VGA.

 Gee, pressing S for ^S i.e. to stop/start scrolling, and pressing C
for ^C and K for ^K to cancel a bit or kill out completely should work
at all times - except when CBBS is busy doing something like writing
to the disk. Also if you type an invalid command such as "new", it
executes a "synonym" which happens to have ^K disabled, but then you'd
see the message:
 +Can't Ctl-K now
so I'm wondering - did you see that?
 Sorry you had problems.
