]Hi..Just wanted to say thanks for the information and the patience
I'm sure new users can be a pain but your board doesn't make us feel
that way.  I'll look forward to calling again. Thanks again.

Cool! How does it compare to MKS, the winner of the Unix-shell-on-DOS
wars?
 Sorry, I don't know where to upload it. Right, CBBS is a message-only
system.

This should probably be on the sports talk shows ( I'm sure it will be
for the next 3 weeks and as soon as the BUlls lose a game); but
I'm still shocked to hear of Jordan's retirement. I figured the
thought would come, but that he still was on top of the game and
would want a 4 peat.
 I guess the question, is will he stay retired, and if not then this
whole episode will seem foolish.
 I guess we will hear the details tomorrow at 10am at his press
conference.

 Hope this isn't too off-base for this board, but.

 I bought a beater in February. It had no radio (the previous owner,
who used his extensively, removed it before sale). It also had a
cracked windshield which I wanted replaced. I asked around and got
a recommendation to go to Silva's Auto Glass & Trim in Elmwood Park.
The price was right, etc. so I took it there.
 Then a few problems, like a leaking radiator, etc. made me hesitate
to put my $300 radio in my $600 car, so I waited to install it until
two days ago. When it didn't work (3 FM stations and 0 AM), I did some
checking.
 The windshield, which they specifically said had the same built-in
antenna as the old one, did NOT have a connection from that antenna
to the "car" (the coax going to the radio). The area where that wire
would have attached to the windshield was sealed over solidly with RTV
rubber.
 Fernando Silva this morning refused to make good on it. He held
tightly to his 90-day warranty and ignored my protests that that
windshield never had a working antenna, provably so by the fact that
the glass was sealed over and the "car" connector was corroded by months
of laying bare and connectorless.
 If you do decide to patronize them, make sure to get everything in
writing AND to personally check every aspect of the work. My personal
recommendation is to avoid them at all costs, as I feel very cheated.
