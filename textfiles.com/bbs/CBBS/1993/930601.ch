I don't understand - just where does the mouse cable go into?

to NORB DEMBINSKI re: R/HP 1200C DESKJET PRINTER

 I never heard of the 1200C, didn't know it was coming, then found myself
standing in front of it at Comdex - Beeeeautiful printer! By going with
separate cartridges for the 4 colors, it can print SO much faster - i.e.
with the 500C/550C CYM cartridge, it has less holes, and only prints 1/3
of the width stripe that the black one does.
 It looks like it is at least 11" wide, and since it is a "plotter-like"
machine, I'd think it would go to 11 x perhaps 17. But, like I say, I
didn't know about it before Comdex, and I didn't persue it any further -
I've no budget for anything beyond what I have already, since I have no
REAL use for what I already have - I just tinker.
 (no need to sign your msgs - header says who it is from).

to ALL re: COMDEX REPORT

 Found a few interesting things at Comdex -
 - Deskjet 1200C printer - has separate cartridges, prints very fast; seems
to have much larger paper size capability; they also have a "deskjet" that
looks like it might do D or E size!
 - "morph" - this is a program that morphs one graphic into another - and
does an EXCELLENT JOB. Price was $74 or so, I ordered a copy. By example,
they had a (real?) stamp of Elvis, from some foreign country, in which he
was in his Army hat, and another in which he was wailin' away with hair down
over his forehead - the morph between these 2 pictures was VERY smooth,
with almost a look of the hair pulling up, and into the cap, as the cap
appeared. They nicely morphed between a kitten and a lion, between women
and men (with obviously interesting in-between pictures). I'll give a
full report when it arrives.
 - fractal image compression - someone finally has an affordable (under
$100) image compression for the PC using fractals. Up to 100-to-1 compression,
and you can pick the level you need. Since it determines "areas", and not
just pixels, you can blow the image back up to other sizes without getting
the "jaggies". For example, if there's a little crescent-shaped light
highlight in the eye of a face, and you blow it up 200%, you don't get a
jaggie highlight, you get one twice as big!
 - Been looking for a laser pointer, but I didn't want to spend > $75, so
whad-ya-know, someone was selling them for $72 @ Comdex! (wound up going
up to the black anodized one for $82 after all).
 - "Jammer" - a nice (I think!) replacement for band-in-a-box, a MIDI
algorithmic composition/accompaniment program. Ability to add a lot more
instruments, and have finer control over styles, chord changes (on 8th
notes, not just quarter notes like B-I-A-B).
 Lots of other cool stuff. VERY tempted to buy Fractal Design Painter
and the bundle with the pressure-sensitive Wacom tablet, but just can't
justify the expense to just have a "new toy" no matter how cool.

On the Computer Chronicles they had the 5th annual trivia bowl. The first
question concerned you and Randy and the fact that you guys set up the
first bulletin board system. No one on the two teams got it.

It goes INSIDE the keyboard cable coil. You've probably done like me -
waiting on the phone, you manage to wrap the coil cord around a pencil.
My 'innovation' (single quotes) works the same way - I just wraped
the coil around the mouse cable. It's conceptually weird (at least it
was for me!) because it looks like you shouldn't be able to do that. But
it works. I suppose that if you don't have a coiled cable, it could
be a lot harder. :-)

Msg 46285 is 10 line(s) on 06/01/93 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to WARD re: CABLES.

I'm not sure I'm explaining this clearly, so here goes again. Take
your mouse (well, trackball that fits on the keyboard). It has a long
straight cord. Stretch that out so that one end is right by the point
where your keyboard cable comes out of your keyboard. Now, stretch
out the coiled keyboard cable and wrap it around the mouse cable so that
the latter goes along the inside of the loops. Like I said, weird, but
it works. When I first had the idea, I thought that I'd have to MAKE an
extension cable for the mouse, and put on the connector AFTER I'd
run the cable through the coils. But the coils AREN'T CLOSED. It's all
one long opening. #@$%! It's harder to explain than to do.

 I'll be darned, thanks for the info! Normally, I would have taped
Chronicles, but I was out of town @ Comdex, & stayed the weekend with
friends. Heh.
 'preciate the info!
 What was the question? "Who set up the first BBS?" or what?
 Thanks again.

 Oh, it worked by "induction"? Hmmm.
 I almost wouldn't believe you if it weren't for an experience of my own:
A customer said that their IBM 3812 printer was "flakey" and that at times
it would take HOURS to print the first page.
 Well, I went there, and tried - sure enough, it was "flakey". I hooked
up my RS-232 break-out box, and things seemed kind of screwey. I finally
swapped pins 2-3, and the printer started working VERY well.
 I said "I don't know why, but it IS working, and don't touch that box
under the table the printer is on" (my RS-232 break-out box).
 I called the next day, asked if they used the IBM-supplied cable. They
said "no, we made our own because we coudln't get the ends thru the little
"dog houses" that go into the floor". "Could you give me the name/number
of the guy who made the cable?" . talked to the guy, he did a 1-1 cable!
The 3812 required a "null-modem" cable!
 All I could figure out was that there was enough signal INDUCED from the
one cable to the other cable! (2 <-> 3) etc.
 Strage!

 Oh, I see - you just ran the trackball cord THRU the keyboard loop -
ya, like you said - like wrapping the phone cord around a pencil - BUT
you HOOKED IT UP, ah, I see. Not "induced". Just making a single sort
of cable out of two since one is coiled. Heh. Sorry to be so dense!

Ward,
 Did you check out any of the palmtops from Apple, IBM, etc.
They have run some nice video on CNN tonight.
If so, how much computing poer are they packing? Are they anywhere
near replacements for notebooks ?
