]I just got a PC/modem and am just starting to play around
with BBSes.  Hopefully next time I call in, I will have
more time to look around and read more messages.  I read
a few but it is getting late.  Basically, I saw your number
in WIRED and I figured I would check it out.  See you later.

Msg 46498 is 12 line(s) on 10/18/93 from DENNIS STAHL
to ROY LIPSCOMB re: II/E PROBLEM

Ah yes. I remember the screen full of garbage well. About 5 years
ago I had a similar problem with my daughters II/e. Unfortunately
I do not remember which chip. I tried "rocking" all chips, connectors,
etc. all to no avail. The "brute force" method I used (rather than
trying to isolate which gate in which chip was the offender) is as
follows: 1)Make a list of all the 74- series chips in the machine.
Note, there are duplicates. 2)Purchase one each of all the chips (I
believe this set me back all of $5-7 at Tri-State Electronics.
3)Substitute half (binary search) of the chips at a time. You will
soon correct (and if you continue isolate) the bad chip. Any
questions? Ask. Good luck! P.S. I don't remember which chip but the
symptoms you describe are exactly the same.

Has anyone ever used the services of the consulting firm
Computer Power Group? I'm just checking them out because
the are international and seem to be big.
Let me hear from you good or bad.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/FIND COMMAND

Thanks for the note. I have been using your bullentin board to test our
modem. It always seems to be available for me to check my systems ability
to connect to another one.

Msg 46501 is 04 line(s) on 10/22/93 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to MIKE AND DENNIS re: II/E PROBLEM

Thanks for your suggestions. I've made a copy of your messages
for my "tool kit." (The teacher is otherwise occupied with
the school play, etc. When she's free again, I get back to
her.)
