to ALL re: PROBLEMS WITH PKZIP 2.04C

The new PKzip/unzip is indeed real, but it has at least 3 identified problems:

1) QDPMI.SYS v1.00, the Quarterdeck DOS Protected Mode Interface, will not get
along with either pkzip or pkunzip. This can be worked around with a SET
PKUNZIP=-) and a statement in the file PKZIP.CFG that reads DPMI=disable. If
you do NOT do this, both PKzip and PKunzip will reboot your system!

2) PKZip 2.04c will allocate a 16k UMB and will NOT give it back when it is
done executing. This is especially troublesome for those who process outside
DESQview and then start the bbs, or those who do not use DESQview. The UMB is
allocated in the middle of the largest available continous block.

3) Related to 2), the statement XMS=disable or XMS=off is completely ignored,
so that cannot be used to work around it, and can also cause other problems.
The commandline switch - does work, but not every program that calls PKzip can
have the commandline configured.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: MODEM

I just got this new modem, a PPI14400, and it does seem to have
problems connecting to some modems. What type of modem is CBBS
running on these days, a USR maybe ? That seems to be the most
difficult for the PPI to connect to, but I really don't have
enought data yet to come to any "real" conclusions. If I'm able
to come to some answers that may be of use, I'll pass them on.

Msg 46012
01 ?  Yep, CBBS is on a USR 2400.  Tonight I connected at:
02 ? - 1200 = garbage
03 ? - 1200 = garbage
04 ? - 2400 = just great, error free.
05 ?That's quite similar to other times - if I get a 1200, I just hang up.
06 ?  Mebbe CBBS deserves a newer modem ;-)
07 ?  THoughts?
08 ?
