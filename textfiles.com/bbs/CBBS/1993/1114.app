Ward.

I am publisher of BBS Callers Digest Magazine soon to be called
BBS Magazine. I think that you meet my partner John Carcione at
One BBScon two years ago at Fred Clark's Dinner/Party. Well we are
sponsoring our first annual BBS EXPO in April 94 in Washington DC and
would like to discuss with you the possibility to have you as a Guest
Speaker.

If possible. could you call me at: 609-953-9110 (10am to 4pm EST) or
at: 609-231-1757 up to 11pm est. If not; could I get a voice number
to contact you?

Will check back here later today for a reply. thanks
