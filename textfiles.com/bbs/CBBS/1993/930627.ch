 First, curious what you mean by "computer boxes" (.done of late).
 And the resolution/size scares me - 2400 DPI B/W would be 720K bytes
PER SQUARE INCH - or over 5 million if we talk 8-bit color. Multiply
that by a 2 x 3 foot area - that's 800 square inches - we're talking
4 billion byte images. Or am I missing something? (like a 2400 dpi
negative BLOWN UP TO 2 x 3?
 This amazes me.
 Yet again the quality of the screen images amaze me, so maybe it is
some incredible density/size.
 Curious to learn more.
 Thanks! VERY interesting!

This hasn't been much of an issue before, but. My spouse and I
are thinking of getting a PC for home use. Problem is that my
apartment is wired with no ground - not even the outlet boxes provide
a good ground (hot to outlet screw is ~25 VAC, which leads me to
believe that the grounding is THROUGH something else, if it's there
at all). On the other hand, probably contrary to code, there are 3-wire
outlets in all rooms. My question - what are the odds of something bad
happening to a computer plugged into one of these outlets? Obviously,
the only reasonable surge protection would be to wire HOT to NEUTRAL,
ignoring the ground. Or, alternatively, could I run a wire (inside the wall
with a little help) down to the laundry room and clamp it to a cold water
pipe? That's what we used to do in the old ham radio days, and I assume
that would also do the job for a PC.

We've also been considering a laptop (many have 2-wire supplies), but
they're awfully costly to get the same level of performance (25 MHz
386sx class) as the desktops.

My best suggestion is prpare to spend the money for an electrician.
