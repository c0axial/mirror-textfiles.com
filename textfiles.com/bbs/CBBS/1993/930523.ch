 Heh, I did the same thing - made my own checkbook manager. I wrote mine
in FoxBase (i.e. "xBase") same as you. I just had a BLAST adding rampant
feature-itis to it, designing nice screens, etc. I like my check recon-
ciliation a lot - you just hit 'r', and it pops up each un-reconciled
check or deposit, and says "This one Y/N/Quit" and you go y y y y y n y n
y q and what it does it zero the balance each time, then you do a "T"
function that runs a total - it scans from the oldest check for a zero
balance, and starts computing the balance from that point.
 I base mine on a check number (0 for deposit or cash card withdrawal),
date, "to", and two very important flags: a "deposit" flag, and a "cleared"
flag.
 I also had fun doing strange things like "Z", which goes to the bottom
of the file, then backs up about 12 records, then stacks the keypresses
for "down down down down", then goes into browse. The reason I do this,
is that, like editors, I like my "active" line to be near the top of the
screen, but not THE top line of the screen.
 I have a display function that scrolls from the BOTTOM UP, and changes
colors - 4 colors, for the 4 combos of deposits vs checks, and cleared
vs not.
 One day a friend was over, and asked what my electric bill was like.
I did an extract for "comm ed", popped it into Quattro Pro, and showed a
graph (heh). I THINK Fox Pro might have some graphics built in. I bought
it but never installed it. I talked work into buying the run-time library.
 Owell, hope you find a dBase IV compiler!

to PAUL CHARTRAW re: R/THE CBBSLIST

 Hmmm, I did furrow my brow when I saw the name "CBBS" - it IS the name
of THIS system, AND an officially registered name, at that. Other than
that we carried it as a service for a while (difficult, since we have no
file xfer and I had to mash it into some messages with an editor), there
was no tie-in to CBBS. Hmmm again.
 I granted the use of its name? Hmmm, I guess like the guy who said I
promised him a million dollars yesterday, you could BOTH be right, I DO
have a bad memory, but this DOES come as a complete surprise to me.
 (Then again, one day I asked Chuck Forsberg where he came up with the
idea of the name "Ymodem". He said "You suggested it". Embarassed, I went
through my old Compuserve captured messages, and found the one I SENT HIM
suggesting the name, because "YAM" was his commo program, and "Y" was one
more than "X", etc)
 CBBSLIST seems as inappropriate (people might come here asking about it-
and do ask "in general" about BBS Lists) just as being the Stillwaters
BBS list they went to him and he wants it stopped.
 Gee, credit where due: Call it the Hideaway Chicago Area BBS list, and
in the front of it credit Stilwaters/Colby for all the effort perhaps.
CBBS in the name just seems confusing and IS misleading.

 Hey, Norb, does this mean you got the auto-upload working? Or just gave
up and typed it all in? heh.
 Good luck selling the stuff! Dunno where to go for the best shot at
selling it.Limited market, mostly corporate, some hobbyists.
 To anyone looking over "our shoulder" I've known Norb for a long time,
you can be comfortable dealing with him.

Ward:

 I wish that I did get in to upload but I couldn't get it to work
yet. I did it the hard way character by character. Thankx for the promo
I have had some replys to my offers. One reply was the guy was going to
buy most of the equipment that I had for the PS/2. I am waiting for him
to come back and say yeas or no. I will just keep on trying to sell the
equipment.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/DBIV?

Sounds like fun! Mine's not that fancy, but it works. The main thing
was that we're here in DC, writing checks for students 20 at a time, and
the commercial version I bought had me inputting the date and check #
for each and every one. The one I wrote auto-increments the check #
(you can still change it) and carries the date. So when I start it up,
if the last entry was a check, I have the appropriate number, plus
the date of the last transaction. Nothing really fancy, though -
I wanted to take a UNIX-like approach and keep it small.

My one fancy move was to use BROWSE on to clear the checks (used a
logical field) and then I have dBXL pump the data out to a DIF
file and start SuperCalc4, which reads a macro, pulls in the DIF,
and figures running and cleared balances. This would limit me to
small files, except that dBXL can swap itself out of memory, which
leaves me about 430K of workspace once SC4 loads.

My one fancy thing was gonna be making the check/withdrawal fields
red and others green, but I decided that was just too much. Total
size of everything (excluding the .DBF file) is just 4K. I also
learned a little about disk space preservation - I put all the
subr{utines in a PROCEDURE file. I thought the allocation unit
problem was CP/M only, but that saved me around 18K of disk space
right there. Hmmm. I wonder if I can combine the main .PRG and
the procedure file? I'll have to check.

to ALL re: VOICE ON THE INTERNET

 I just finished listening to a description of what was hesitantly
described as an event comparable to Marconi's first transmission of
data over the air waves. The event took place yesterday, Friday,
on NPR, when the program "Science Friday" was simulcast over the
Internet. That is, voice data was digitized and broadcast to
whoever happened to be listening with equipment that could
convert the data back to voice. What's more, the broadcast
took place in real time-and was interactive. A tape of the
 voice returned to the radio studio sounded better
than telephone quality, apart from the fact that there was
relatively frequent dropout. Details of the required equipment
were not given.
 A broadcasting "studio" for the Internet has been set up, with
plans to broadcast Congressional and other governmental sessions.
 Six months ago, I asked at a computer club meeting if the
Internet could be used as a cheap/free telephone. Nobody there
thought it was feasible yet. Do times change, or what!
