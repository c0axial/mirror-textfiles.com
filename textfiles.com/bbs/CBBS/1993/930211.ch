 Randy hasn't called here in a Loooong time, sorry.
 History of CBBS? Heh. Couple thousand words there. Next question:
 BBSs today vs when we started? Gee, few similarities. I guess the
biggest difference is the use of multiple lines, lots of file transfers,
"conferences", email forwarding (ala FIDO) etc.
 What am I doing now? Well, RIGHT now I'm going "C" programming on a
Risc system for X-windows graphics applications, on a contract. I work
for IBM and this is my 25th year (not all that well known, nor relevant).
I spend a lot of time on, on order of time, Compuserve, Unix (Randy went
on to run a series of public-access systems, most recently "chinet"),
CBBS, BIX, America Online, etc.
 Define a BBS? Well, I coined the term, and in doing so, meant to imply
the computerization (C) of a Bulletin Board System (BBS) = CBBS. In other
words, postings of messages - questions, answers, etc. I didn't then
and don't now believe REAL strongly in private mail - I like as many people
as possible to participate in the conversations, etc.
 But a definition? Just about any dial-in system that at least includes
a message base. I suppose something more sophisticated could be called
a "conferencing system".

Thanks for taking the time to answer Ward! I sorta feel like Moses t
to God (removing sandals approaching burning screen). Does the board look
the same as when you first started it? I read that it went online in
February 16?, 1978. How long did it take to write the program? If there
is a definitive Ward and Randy history boI'd sure like to find it.
If not, perhaps you should write your memoirs??? <G> I think the only
important thing I've learned from this paper, is that I don't know
*anything!*.

I'm trying to learn C on my own right now. I have micro C and probably
this fall will upgrade to something that can handle Borland C+.

Well, again, I appreciate your answering.

to ALL re: PARITY & CLOCK CYCLES

Computers have come along way since the Altair 8800 back in 1975. Memory
has also. Static, giving way to dynamic with external clock, to todays
chip.
 With this in mind, is parity checking really necessary. The only
time I have seen it come up is if there has been a memory failure, or
a static shock which kills the machine anyways.
 Specifically, the newer BIOS's have the ability to disable parity
check, making memory cheaper (not really that much), but MY REAL
QUESTION IS:
 Does the memory parity checking take CPU time, making the machine run
slower, or do the motherboards have a chip responsible for memory
management and things such as parity checking ??
dup. chars.
