]After the last call and before this call I dialed up at 300 and
connected -- CBBS wouldn't talk.  Tried at 1200 and got some usual
garbage x~x~x~x~ and nothing else.  Now I am back to my normal 19.2
setting and CBBS connects as usual -- 2400 nice and clean. Go figure.

to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/VESA IDE CONTROLLER

 I have always argued, that the disk spins at a certain bit rate below
the heads, and you can't go faster than that, so based upon that, "yes",
you're right - only will CACHE really help things.
 I kind of wonder what the trade-offs are between cache on a drive, and
cache in memory. I presume some drive caches are maybe a track, assuming
sequential access. I think Smartdrv can read-ahead, but then again Brett
Glass in InforWorld mentioned that that can cause problems on a drive that
doesn't make bad spots invizobobble: namely it doesn't look at the fat and
compute where the bad spots are, so it can "go away for a while" trying to
read a bad spot, because lets say cluster 1234 is what you read, but 1235 is
bad - smartdrv might read-ahead trying to read say 8 clusters, and would
than "hang" for a while trying to read the bad spot.
 Interesting thought: IBM's ValuePoint had an STB accelerator board of
some sort, and in spite of not being local bus, performed better than Dell's
local bus implementation. So just being Vesa isn't sufficient to mean that
it is REALLY fast; a good vesa implementation will of course beat a good
ISA implementation.

 Hi, and thanks for being around - nice to see a name that has been
calling for years.
 I'm curious: why did you ask for help on "linefeeds"? Are you getting
double spaced output or something? Shouldn't be unless YOUR software is
translating a received (or even sent?) CR into a CR/LF, then CBBS sends
the obligatory LF, so you get double spacing. (Anything TANDY related?
I remember people having problems with their printers since they auto-LF'd
when they'd get a CR, so MOST software could cause double spacing.

Msg 46208 is 06 line(s) on 04/15/93 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: VISA? VESA?

 Help me understand. There are two things these days with similar names,
prounounced like the credit card - or is one Veh-suh?
 One I understand is a graphics standard, probably implying a VGA/SVGA
BIOS, the other a hardware standard for local bus.
 Just what ARE the right acronyms?
 Thanks!

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/CONNECT OK?

 After talking to you I tried to connect at 9600 again and the connect
failed. I tried at 7200 and 4800 and failed to connect also.
I took your advice and tried at 2400 and I connected OK. The system seems to
only connect at 2400.

 I have been trying for some time to get the logon script to work correctly
I don't seem to have the knack of getting it correct. I have also
been working on upgrading my machine with a new XGA-2 and SCSI w/cache
adapters. I have also got the new 9517 display and CD ROM II items
installed.
Well this is enough for now.
