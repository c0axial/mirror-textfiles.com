It really does feel like looking back in time... kinda makes me look

 Thanks! CBBS is far from the best - but yes, it is the oldest (grin).
We had a great pizza-party celebrating the 15th anniversary last Sat.

 That sounds strage! Are you using software that doesn't give you
feedback as to how it connected? For example, when I call CBBS, I'm
just using "dumb terminal mode", and I see this:
 "CONNECT 2400/ARQ"
so I know what speed I'm going. What COULD be happening is that you are
calling into - this is unlikely - a 1200 baud system, that supports
MNP, and with one modem you're going "true" 1200, with the other, you're
going 1200 but with MNP that supports compression, and your modem, at
2400, CAN compress data and get more than 2400.
 There is no program to "test' a modem that I can think of. What you
might do is something that takes a given time - like "help files" on
CBBS, that will, if I'm remembering right, type out a few pages of
"stuff" (or better - the "B" command - bulletin). This will type about
40 lines. You'll need a stopwatch. OF COURSE, it could be that you
don't SEE a speed diff with CBBS but only with some other system.
 Modems are inherently a VERY slow device when you're talking 1200
or 2400 - after all, with things like LapLink, your PC can do 115,000
baud, so it is really just waiting for the data to be sent.
 Could you have some modem profiles set differently - like parity
on one and not the other? But that would account for only one bit in
10, or 10%.

 About a week ago CBBS stopped hanging up when you were done, and
powering off/on the modem and fiddling with cables seemed to fix it.
 Also I was having trouble connecting at the right speed - I always
come in at 2400, but would often get a 1200 or 300 connection - had to
modify my script to hang up and try again. Lately it has always been
2400 - but not enough to "PROVE" it.
 Curious for your recent experiences.
 Thanks!
 P.S. Tomorrow (Feb 16) is the "official" 15th birthday anniversary of CBBS.

 Wish you could have made it to the party! Tony Antonucci & Alex

Ward,
 I had a 1200 connect last night (2/14) verses 2400 which I dialed at.

Msg 46081 is 09 line(s) on 02/16/93 from LYNN ANDERSON
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/ALL 2400 MODEMS EQUAL?

Thanks for your reply Ward, I don't think the problem is in
the software setup only because the only thing I change is the
com port, all other settings are the same. I do this with
TAPCIS, GEnie Aladdin and Qmodem, I can actually see the msgs
being typed to the screen much slower with the internal modem,
and the connect times also increase for basically the same # of
msgs. I did find a modem testing program call Modem Doctor Ver 4.0
and it gave me a couple of error msgs, so I think I'll call the
mfg. and talk to them. Thanks again for your reply and this BBS.

I still have not "developed" the pictures from the CBBS b-day
party. I will "real soon now" and leave you a message here as

To anyone I missed. Sorry for my tardy arrival last Sat.
An associate from Boston came in and we had to work on Sat.
as he was flying out Sun morning. See ya @ the 16th!

Donnie,
 It has been a very long time. I'm right up the road from you in
Bannockburn. I'm currently renting my body to A.C. Nielsen. As for the
real topic of discussion, I believe that we still have a long way to go
before we reach the fundamental limits of the universe with just known
materials. To date, developments in silicon technology has been so fast
that other semiconductor ( and for that matter, superconductor )
technologies have not been able to catch up in terms of speed/price/
pation. [ eg. Gallium Arsenide, Josephen effect, etc.] Once
silicon tops off ( of course, I remember predictions of this in the
1970's), one or more others will probably surpass and replace it. Even
now, silicon seems to be evading death once again, by the use of lower
voltages. If someone really wanted to, I'm sure that they could build
a freon ( how about environmentally safe halogen compound ) cooled
XXX86 machine ala Cray's Cray II.

I hate to be the harbinger of bad news, but rave is dead. It came, it
saw, it left. And just where did you get the idea that someone on this
honorable, and respectable, information exchange would even contemplate
going to a party where people consume hallucinagenic compounds and
dance to loud music past dawn???
dup. chars.
