Msg 46504 is 09 line(s) on 11/01/93 from BILL MATTSON
to ALL re: APPLE MAC SE

Being an Intel kind of guy, I don't know much about Apples. However,
my son's MAC SE has quit. I understand it's not worth much, but he likes
it and wants me to fix it. I've tried all the obvious stuff we all
recommend to each other. The screen exhibits a sort of checkerboard
pattern on bootup, interspersed with little unprintable characters, and
bootup does not complete. Anybody have any experience with this? Any
ideas? Anybody have an old MAC SE I could scrounge the logic board
out of? I might pay a little for a fix, but not much. If you can help,
I'd appreciate it. Thanks in advance for your help.
