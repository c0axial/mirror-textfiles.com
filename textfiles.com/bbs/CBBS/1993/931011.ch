to ALL re: MICROCHANNEL AUDIO CARD

 Anyone know of a good microchannel sound card that is being currently
marketed or will be before the end of this year? I do not want or am
interested in anything built by Creative Labs like the Sound Blaster boards
or some of their other products. I have had nothing but problems with
their products and technical support giving me the run around.

Thanx

to MURRAY ARNOW re: APPLE IIE PROBLEM

A parish school nearby has an Apple IIe that won't boot. When
you turn it on, the screen fills with blocks the size of character
cells, each a random color. The screen seems to flip to a different
set of random colors after four seconds or so, and does this again
about four times in all. At that point, it enters an infinite loop
of beeps (about four to eight staccato at a time) followed by a few
seconds of silence.

I turned off the machine, removed the disk drive card and the serial
card, then turned the machine back on. The symptoms recurred.

Any clues?

to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/APPLE IIE PROBLEM

Gee Roy, it's been along time since I've seen an Apple IIe. I gave everything
relating to the Apple away years ago. So what I can relate comes from an
imperfect memory. I suggest you remove all the cards and try to boot. If the
same problem persists, try pushing down om all the chips to make sure their
well seated. If the problem doesn't go away it could be either faulty RAM or
a faulty ROM. You may try swapping components with a known working Apple.
I don't know if any of this is of use to you, I'm sorry I can't help more.
