Msg 46161 is 11 line(s) on 03/19/93 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to DAVID JOHNSON re: R/DISK CLEANUP

 Uh, OK, I cranked it up. I didn't "trust" it so I put it on my laptop,
but I couldn't get it to do anything. Perhaps I didn't have a large
enough file. I'll experiment more. Just to have it record the last ref
date for a file would be useful, but the limit of 100 is a SEVERE limit -
I have for example 300 files in several directories.
 Ah, but come to think of it, there is source, and I could change it.
 Thanks again.
 I still think the best way is to TRASH the system, and restore only
what I need.
 Also Randy Suess suggests a dir w/ the original install files in it,
and another dir with the files you create. That might help.
