to RICHARD PAQUETTE re: R/INVITATION

Hi, sorry you didn't get a msg from me the next day - been gone on biz
trip. Dunno about the speaking invitation - kind of burned out on that,
the BBS "hobby" has gone so commercial, I've pretty much lost interest in
it - I figure after maybe the next BBSCON it will be way beyond what I'm
interested in. Between BBSCON, Hackers Convention, and this year, the
Computers, Freedom, & Privacy convention award from the Electronic Freedom
foundation, I really am burned out on the computer related circuit (I
stopped going to COMDEX).
 Well, I'll try to give you a call.

Is the high-capacity ink cartridge for the Deskjet refillable?

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/INVITATION

Can understand how you feel. although I may not have explained BBS EXPO w
well enough to you. We are attempting to gather the "other" end of
BBS'ers. the so called "hobby" people and folks that just bought a modem
and have no idea what to do with it etc. If you would take a minute
to call. I can most probably explain ourselves much better to you.

Also. if you haven't seen recent copies of our magazine. I would like
to mail you the past six or seven copies for your review and then you
would see the "type" of bbs'er we are talking to via the magazine and
the "type" we are gathering for this convention.

If you would like. I can be reached in the evenings at: 609-231-1757
and please feel free to call collect. daytime: 609-953-9110 ok.

Thank you for taking the time to explain your feelings and hope to
hear from you soon.
