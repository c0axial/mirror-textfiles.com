Msg 46120 is 30 line(s) on 03/04/93 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to ALL re: FLASH: DAMAGE NOT FROM VIRUS!

Today I encountered a hair-raising problem with my D drive (a hard-
drive partition). There was a sudden epidemic of invalid clusters on
my D drive, afflicting about thirty or forty files. When I tried to
restore the files from backups, other files got damaged and I
observed further trauma, an outbreak of cross-linking.

After wrestling to restore the damaged files for several hours, I
finally despaired enough to think more about the symptoms. I noticed
a crucial clue, which had been I ignoring in my panic: When I ran
CHKDSK to check my progress with the repairs, CHKDSK would always
start out by displaying the message, "possible non-DOS disk:
Continue anyway (y/n)?"

I decided to rev up a disk-sector editor, and poked around in
the control areas of drive D. When I did, I could find only one
anomaly: The first four bytes of both FATs were peculiar. Those
bytes are normally F8 FF FF FF; but on my D drive, those bytes were
2D DD 9F C3. As a test, I restored those bytes to their usual
values, then ran CHKDSK. CHKDSK no longer reported "possible
non-DOS disk." I was then able to replace the bad files without
inflicting new damage, and the drive once again operated normally.

After solving this problem, I recalled that in the past year I
had encountered a similar problem. One of the hard-disk partitions
had suddenly become balky, refusing to operate normally with some
common utilities that had presented no problems previously. I finally
tracked that problem down; the first byte of the FAT had been altered
e strange value. As in the present case, when I restored
AT signature to its normal value, the problem was cured.
(Continued next message)

to ALL re: FLASH: DAMAGE (2)

It's popular to suspect viruses as the cause of most (if not all)
unexplained file disruptions nowadays. In those incidents where
a virus is not found, well, it be a new type that at present escapes
detection.

Was this damage caused by a virus? I really doubt it. Anyone who
wants to scramble a FAT would hardly stop after changing less than
five bytes. My guess is that the damage was caused by some bug in
DOS or in some utility program- a bug perhaps that shows itself only
under very unusual circumstances.

However, this kind of diagnosis doesn't make headlines. ("Man finds
data loss was not due to virus!") The result is that viruses
have become the scapegoats for all sorts of mischief (kind of like
like Communists were in the '50s).

So is there a moral to this story? Yes: If your hard drive or files
seem to have gotten damaged or scrambled for no obvious reason, try
checking the first four bytes of the FAT. (In fact, it may be a good
idea to check them now, while everything is functioning normally,
so that you'll know exactly how to restore them if they do go bad.)
You may have to boot off a diskette to do this, if the hard drive is
no longer bootable; so keep an emergency boot diskette handy that
contains a disk-sector editor (and other diagnostic and repair tools).

P.S. As noted above, the value that overlaid the FAT signature was
2D DD 9F C3. Does this give any clue to what caused the overwriting?

It'd would really be sad to see this trailblazing institution
disappear. Are there alternatives? Could others take over the
job of sysop, so you'd be free for other more rewarding pursuits?

Sorry about the midirected message. I guess that I saw Ed's name
and didn't realize the reply would go to you.

to ROY re: CBBS

Not to worry, Roy. You know that on occasion, when the spirit moves him,
Randy mutters threats about giving up CBBS causing Ward and a couple of
his loyal assistant operators to beat him back into some semblance of
sanity and CBBS continues its existence. [Did I glimpse the word
"sysop" in your posting? As the owner and custodian of the original
CBBS machine you must recall that you used a word that could be cause
for immediate removal of the offending message? tsk tsk]

Msg 46125 is 08 line(s) on 03/06/93 from ALEX ZELL
to ALL re: PRIVACY

 An earlier message leads me to believe that some visitors here may
not realize that CBBS is a *public* bulletin board and that there is
no *mail* function here. All postings are readable by everyone.
There is no privacy here, and no private messages can be sent or
read - with two minor exceptions. Ward can *flash* a message that
can be read only by the caller to whom it is addressed; Ward and
his assistants can read comments left upon logging off, at the
<g,y> function.

to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/CBBS RETIRING?

 Why do you say retiring? I posted nothing. I gotta move toward
converting to "C" - maybe with my 12 extra days vacation IBM gave me,
I will use that time. CBBS recently added external Bernoulli's for
backup, and I JUST installed the HST back on it, I don't see any
particular "its dying" indications.
 Matter of fact, next week I get a free flight to San Francisco, to
receive the Electronic Frontier Foundation's (Mitch Kapor started it)
Pioneer award - along with the founders of the Internet, the Trailblazer
modem, etc.

to ALL DESKJET USERS re: CHEAP INK

Well, not cheap, REALLY, but close. INMAC (the company everyone seems
to love to hate, including me) has a deal on high-capacity black
printheads for the DJ series - their catalog says "buy two for $47.50,
get one free!" Well, after tax & shipping it was $55, but that's still
pretty good for 3 high capacity units, and they arrived the next day.

That works out to about $18.30 per cartridge, tax & shipping included;
I don't know what they go for in Chicago, but the same cartridge would
cost $38 EACH at our college bookstore.

My advice? Order a few and stock up!
dup. chars.
