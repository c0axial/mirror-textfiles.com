Msg 46110 is 09 line(s) on 02/27/93 from RUSSELL STEVENS
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: CBBS IN C

Ward,
   I use an interrupt driven assembler comm routine that maintains
a buffer of any size.  You could call my routine and get a character
back and a status code indicating if a framing error occurred or not.
If the buffer were empty, the status code would indicate that no
character was available.  The wait function would be contained in
the calling routine.
   If you're interested, you can get in touch with me through
Roy Lipscomb.  Talk to you later.  R.
