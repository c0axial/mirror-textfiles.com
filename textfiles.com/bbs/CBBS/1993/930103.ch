to BENJAMIN COHEN re: R/NEW TOYS?

 I, too, got a Sportster 2400/9600 modem (for work), and WinFaxPro, but
it would NOT work under OS/2. I understand release 3 should work, but
instead I took it back and bought PM FAX, which I've not had time to try.
 MTEZ is kind of funny - not sure I understand it. I know that higher
levels of MNP implement synchronous transfer, to avoid the time wasted
by sending start and stop bits, and obviously software can't do that.

to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/RE: TOYS

 I gave my brother a Sharp 5200 for Xmas - the only reason I did was
that he was interested in a "Brother" or "Royal" or some "off" brand,
that was about as big, but not as full featured. This way I can
back his up (occasionally) when I visit, etc. Also I can help him with
usage tips (and he taught me a thing or two by more patiently reading
the book).
 SMALL - "really small" - would be a distinct advantage - and being able
to hook to a PC is important (but typically, expensive: nearly $100).

to ELI LEHRER re: INTERVIEW

Tell me more about the "research", please. Ask a few questions, I'll
respond online. Kind of burned out on the interview process, what with
having invented BBSs (and coined the term "BBS"). I DO presume you know
this is the worlds first BBS, about to celebrate its 15th anniversary
in February.
 What is your research for? A write-up? A magazine? Club newsletter?
Where is 203?

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/MSC 7.0 & IBM C SET/2

No, I was referring to use of equivalent calls in each of the two systems,
MSC SDK, and IBM C Set/2. There seems to be similarity, as one would
expect, but still lots of naming difference to keep us busy. Not calls
for Windows, but window calls as in window function calls, handles,
creates, messages, etc. I have the SDK also, and have found some of
Microsoft's sample programs to be more functionally complete than IBM's.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/RE: TOYS

Yeah. You're right about the PC hookup - I was amazed
when I saw the price (today). Still, it's a really nice little
critter. Keyboard has little rubber keys, a one-time SHIFT as well
as a CAPS LOCK. Everything beeps when you hit it, don't know if it
can be silenced, but the beep is nice with something that small. The
screen was good and I THINK it had adjustable contrast. Once nice
feature (from my point of view) was that there was nothing electronic
in the TOP of the case - it was just a door, with some instructions
pasted in it. That helps make this a thin little unit.

to WARD & ALL re: TOYS

I got a Fotoman (actually I bought it a few weeks before Xmas). Takes
up to 32 pictures (Black & White) which then download into the computer
via a serial link. You use a Windows program to preview & edit them.
Pretty nice. Needless to say this years Xmas cards included the dreaded
Xmas letter With PICTURES! I'm learning there is quite difference in
taking photos with the Fotoman then a real camera.
It will be making an appearance at the CBBS birthday party. I would like
to know if anyone will be bringing a laptop/notebook that is capable
of running Windows?? If so I will bring the software and we can view/edit
the pictures.right away! Perhaps a "group" photo of those that attend!
