 If things go as planned, I'll have a 486 COLRO laptop at the
'fest. It will be FROM IBM so it will be running OS/2, I'm sure.
I don't know if they are going to come fully outfitted, or if I get
to install what I want.

Msg 46001 is 09 line(s) on 01/03/93 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: HOME DESIGN PROG?

 Is there a program that would allow me to take the plans for my
brother's home, and do some renderings of scenes from it? I have
"virtual reality studio", but this is, while interesting, a poorly-
implemented program that just won't do the job.
 I'm aware that Autocad has some sort of 3D package, but I'm talking
significantly less than $1k for my budget.
 I DO have Design Cad 3D, and I think that can do some things.
but not sure it could do the 256 color mode 640 x 480 stuff. Also I'd
want to be able to print on my Color DeskJet.
