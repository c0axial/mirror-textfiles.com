Msg 46494 is 04 line(s) on 10/14/93 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to DARCY EMERY re: R/XMODEM CRC CALCULATION

Sorry, no, CRC wasn't my doing, I don't have code. I DO believe a table-
driven CRC in "C" is on one of the low message #'s of the "Ward Board CBBS"
at (708) 849-1132 (2400 baud) - check msg #'s like 4-5-6-7-8 sort of thing
- you can do "s" then "1" then ^K out and try to retrieve the appropriate ones.

to ROY LIPSCOMB re: APPLE IIE

Roy,
 Those power supplies are also notorious for going flakey. Thow a scope
on the power in and check for a clean signal and voltage. Also a couple
of sprits of contact cleaner on the socketed chips, ( re-seating them)
also helps.
