to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/LAPTOPS

The only negative comment I have is that when I was asked to help a friend
in the Phillipines get a replacement battery and floppy drive for his old
Toshiba laptop (dual floppy - this was a few years ago, at least - Toshiba
wanted an arm and a leg for each and both were back-ordered! There was a
discount for exchange of the old disk drive, but only if you gave them the
old one at the time you ordered the new one. Mind you, this is for a disk
drive they admitted hadn't been in stock in the US in over two months! I
can't say what the current status of parts availability is.

I say this having just purchased a T1000 w/768K RAM card, one floppy, DOS
2.11, 512K base RAM. The RAM card becomes "hard RAM" (a non-volatile
RAM disk), holds ProComm, NewSweep, DTA, SmartKey and VDE, leaving about
300K or so free. With NO floppy access at all it runs over FIVE hours on
a charge (continuous). Using the floppy at all reduces that somewhat, but
with VDE in RAM disk there's no need to use it. The system does not do an
automatic shut-off (unlike my Epson Genevas; which also get >10 hours per
charge), but it's quite serviceable and it DOES have a floppy drive instead
of a tape microcassette drive!

Say, there's a note in the latest Mor-Atlanta newsletter from a guy in the SF
Bay area who has a Kaypro with 2 Meg RAM disk, 4 floppies, and also a
Geneva that he'strying to find a home for!

1979? I think they had the right date; at least when I heard the
question I KNEW that they had the right date. Randal's right; the
ignorance of the panel on some points was amazing (but they knew
some things I didn't know, too). There was nothing quite as bad as
last year's "What does the ERASE command do in MS-DOS?"

Msg 46335 is 08 line(s) on 06/17/93 from BENJAMIN COHEN
to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/LAPTOPS

Second thoughts. The laptop that I really covet at the moment is the
new Canon with the built-in bubble jet printer. Sigh. Still around
$2.5K+. On the more reasonable size is the Gateway 2000 Handbook. At 2.2
pounds, small in size, $1295 (last I saw), only a 286, it's small enough
to make the difference between a laptop you take wherever you think you'll
need one and the laptop you carry EVERYWHERE all the time. There are some
other entrants in this size range, I think. The keyboard really is big
enough; my ex-partner reviewed it and really liked it.

G-Bar Limited Partnership is looking for a programmer. The position requires
PASCAL, C, ASM, and some FORTRAN, scripting and SQL. All work is done on
MACINTOSH, SUN and RS6000. If you're interested send your resume, with
salary history and references to the address below. Phone calls and drop-ins
are a MAJOR no-no so don't even think of it.

Send all resumes to:

to BENJAMIN COHEN re: PS

Yeah, I still have MY Geneva (though my Kaypros are LONG gone), but
we need a machine that'll do VGA (games for the kids, etc) so the
handbook, while nice, is out. I tried the Toshiba 1850 at a COMPUSA
store in Northern Virginia, and it was very nice, both w/respect to
the screen AND the rd (a little blast of lif*ne noise
here). You wanna ~2{buy another Geneva, Ben? This one has VDE 2.11
(if I recall) burned into a ROM, along with some other useful programs.
If you're interested, I'll sell it cheap (I think I still have the
modem/RAMdisk, even.)
