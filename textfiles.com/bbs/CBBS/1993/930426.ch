to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/IDE SPEED/TIMING/LAPTOPS

 Heh, sounds like you're really digging in! A friend merely wanted to
upgrade his LE from, I think, 20M to 40M, and someone at Toshiba support
said it would work (sort of unofficially) but he never got it working,
I think he took it back.
 Won't it read "at all"? I mean, can you do the bit about one of the
hard disk drivers? Or even boot a floppy and fire up the hard disk
driver from there? Probably not.
 Must be a bummer to be SOooo close!
 Are there any other drive brands that might work? Or was that the bit
about non-standard IDE. hmmm.

Msg 46220 is 04 line(s) on 04/25/93 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/VOICE INPUT

 Ya, I saw that thing today @ CompUsa. I am sufficiently intrigued
with the Dragon systems, and how it can do FULL text input. though
not continuous speeth - sort of "discontinuous". Have to leave time
between each word.

Msg 46221 is 09 line(s) on 04/26/93 from DONNIE STUHLMAN
to ALL re: MICROFOCUS COBOL USERS

  Our organization is trying to adopt useing Microfocus Cobol. I need
to talk to some current users about the possible pluses and minuses
of use the MF system.
  Could anyone who uses the MF Workbench please give me a call or
leave a message here as to how to contact you?
  Thanks
