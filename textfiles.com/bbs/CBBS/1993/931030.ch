]Hi, Ward.  Been a long time since I've been up on here.  Thought I'd
try to hire some loyal users.  I used to be VP of the Chicago Ccomputer
Society.  Since then i've been through an Involuntary career change,
but it worked out for the best.  Good to see this is still here!  Best
of luck.

I am Network Manager at Olympia Fields Osteopathic Health and Medical
Center, 20201 S. Crrawford Ave. I need to hire a LAN Administrator and
a Data Communications Specialist. We are building, from scratch, an
1100 user WAN. Four main sites (including a new Data Center being
built in an office building, a University in Downers Grove, a
hospital in Hyde Park, and one in Olympia Fieldss. These all will
have a Wellfleet Router linked to several SynOpticss hubs. Fiber
Optic cable and Level 5 UTP throughout. The sites are to be linked with
multiple T-1s. I need someone to help with setting up the comm net and ca
cable plant. The hosts will be Novell file servers and a number
of HP 9000s running the completely new software systems for this organization
Thus, the net will be running both TCP/IP and IPX. We're shooting for a
Class B licence as well. the organization has committed the bucks,
but I've got to have the right people. If you know something about this
stuff (kknow your protocols!) give me a call. (708) 747 4000, x1486 ASAP!
