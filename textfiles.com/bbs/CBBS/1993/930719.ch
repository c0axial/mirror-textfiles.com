to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/FAX CLASS 1 VS 2

 I checked my Hayes manual - it doesn't tell squat about FAX. The
software works fine - I've used it to send and receive faxes - one of
each, so not much of a test case, though!

Msg 46364 is 11 line(s) on 07/19/93 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to WARD re: GENEVA

Well, I _think_ I have the BASIC ROM lying around still. The Geneva
is also known as the PX-8, and was a direct descendent of the HX-20.

I _do_ have a custom ROM for it with VDE and a couple of neat little
utilities. I chucked the modem wedge when I moved, I think (I'll have
to look).

Anyhow, if you're serious, let me know. $40, shipping included, and
I'll even throw in a tape for the drive (if you have HX-20 tapes (I
THINK that machine had a cassette) they'll likely be readable on
this little machine).
dup. chars.
