]Don't see why it should be an inconvenience.  Was gonna say that
"tail" would help in determining where the thing was cut.  But
Alzheimer's has set in again.  "Tail" didn't work.  What did I
do to read bottom up.  I certain I used to do "tail -50 KXXXX"
and now it doesn't understand the command.

 Thanks! When CBBS stopped hanging up, and I asked Randy to put a
breakout box in it, that seemed to solve everything - I have NOT had
a wrong-speed call since! Maybe there was a cable problem - though
he also mentioned he powered the modem off and on - could have been
a glitch.

Well, here comes some rain.I just called up @2400, but got connected
at 1200. This has happened before, but I thought you'd wanna know since
you're keeping track. SIGH. Just when you think you've got all the
bugs out./^@^\\\ another one creeps along.

 Ya, sorry, same here tonight - got the 2400 call, 1200 connect problem.
My script hung up and tried again - came in OK at 2400.

 The command is type, but with a -nn (sectors).
 type-12 log -or- type-20 l9302
 TAIL would be a good name for it, but I hadn't heard of that unix
command way back in the stone age when I programmed CBBS. I'll fix that
in the very-soon-to-be-done-but-I've-been-saying-THAT-for-years "rewrite".

 Uh, are you the Michael from "Computer Phone Book"? Or are you the
one I asked this of on Compuserve (grin).
 Still AWFULLY angry about Michael Cain the AUTHOR publishing my HOME
VOICE NEVER-was-a-computer number AS a BBS, and therefore effectively
taking my use of it away (I never answer that line any more - haven't
for YEARS).
 And even angrier that Commodore magazine picked it up and in the worst
abortion of journalism I've ever seen, published it AGAIN with a wrong
name, wrong description, etc. Lets see, 7 sentences, 4 errors. AND
they refused to print a retraction! Now THERE'S an S-F-B attitude!
(No, if you don't know that acronym, I won't explain it - grin).

Yes, Ward, I am the other one, from Compuserve, thank goodness! I sure don't
blame you for being PO'd, though. Do you know what PO'd means? <g>
I was wondering if you noticed the posts in IBMHW by Jeff de Pappa on the
Carpal Tunnel problem?
