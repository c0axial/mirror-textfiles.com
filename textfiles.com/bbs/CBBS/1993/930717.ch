Actually wrong subject - in the log you asked about Randy's chinet system.
The guest # is (312) 283-0559.

CBBS was down for 14 days due to a total re-arrangement of "chinet
headquarters" i.e. where Randy runs CBBS and chinet. Sorry for the
outage. Thanks for coming back.

to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/PS

Well, no, I don't REALLY want to buy another Geneva; I have two now, both
with Dvorak keyboard on the system ROM, one with the 120K RAM disk and one
with the combo 64K RAM disk and the modem. I have ZDE 1.6 in ROM! But
another one, especially if the batteries are down, would not be a lot of
use. Besides, I've never been able to get them to talk to my DOS
machines, so when I do take notes I have to bring the machine home and
hook it up to an Exec (actually, I still have an Exec hidden somewhere at
the office; I suppose I should set it up just for this - or would it be
ecologically and economically sound to do some writing on it? I'm sure
it uses a LOT less electricity than my 386-40!

to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/ELECTRICAL QUESTION

Andy, most of the conduit in your building should be ground. It is
very easy to check using an OHM meter, and some wire. If the
conduit is not at ground (assuming your building has metal conduit),
then you have some kind of rupture in the conduit.
Try several boxes in your apartment. I'll bet at leased one box
will have some kind of metal condut link to the main breaker box.
The main breaker box can be used as a gournd (earth). You can
check other possiblities such as using an isolation transformer and
try to establish your own ground, but this is a costly soulution.
Running a seperate ground wire down to the building fuse box will
be expesive also.

Well, it has working batteries. I think it's found a home, tho -
I now have a Zenith 386sx notebook to replace it.

You've NEVER got it talking to a PC? It's EASY. Use the serial
printer cable and (if you have it) the DAKCOM software. Plug
the printer cable's 25-pin end into a 25 pin serial port on your
PC (or a 9-to-25 adaptor, etc). Startup DAKCOM on the Geneva and
set it up for EXTERNAL MODEM, HIGH SPEED (19.2 kbps). Get a comm
program set up at 19.2 kbps on the PC, talking to the port into which
you have plugged the Geneva. You're set. Now, on the Geneva, type
SX followed by your filename and a return. It'll start an Xmodem
transfer (checksum, I think). Start an Xmodem receive on the PC and
yer done. I've been doing this for YEARS! With DSZ, you don't even
need a comm program on the PC - just aim DSZ at the appropriate port
and tell it the speed.

I tell ya - it's getting hard to remember all this CP/M stuff.

to ALL re: MEMORY PRICES UP 53%

I don't get it: A resin plant in Japan burns down and the price of simms
jump about 53% ??? This single plant had a 60% share of the market for
the resin to make the cases is what I have heard. This all sounds like
someone is trying to make a killing off of us. Has anyone heard more?

It has a serial port, all right.  I've had my Geneva hooked up to a
PC for YEARS with no trouble.  To several other machines, as well.

Say, you don't want a bit of computer history for $40, do you?  It's
exactly the same size and weight as a modern laptop, but it does
so much less!!

01 ?  Does the Geneva execute a basic?  i.e. does it come with one?  I might
02 ?be interested - it WAS a system I had considered at one point.  Besides,
03 ?my 10-year-old-laptop died!  (Epson HX-20 - GREAT early machine - tape,
04 ?printer, screen, BASIC, etc.  Problem with it, was that it could have
05 ?been a great "hackers" machine but they refused to release the internals
