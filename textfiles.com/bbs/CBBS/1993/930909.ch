to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/PHONE LINES

I just did a very quick and cursory investigation. I believe that Ma Bell
calls the half duplex service Answer Lines. It is at least available on
Telecommunications Channel Services. Maybe a suitable choice is the Type 2001E
 service. I'll leave it to those interested to contact Ma Bell and get better
information.
