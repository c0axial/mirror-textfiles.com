So is the computer! You should get it in a couple of days via UPS.
I packed it in the Zenith 386sx box; they're just about the same size!

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: GROUP

Ward,
 The GROUP number on the fax is as best as I can tell their designation
for 'modem vis standards' Very OLD faxes are/were group 2 and I believe on
had a max baud of 2400. Group 3 will fall back if connected with an older
fax machine. Group 3 is the current modern day standard, although I also
thought it contained a max specified baud of 9600. Hmmm. Maybe that's
why some machines didn't like my 14.4K faxes.
 I am still finding the quality level of connections/fax interrogations
to be quite a problem. I called 3 different fax back systems and
got connectionsa at 4800,2400, and 9600 baud. Without having another
brand to test side by side I don't know if my modem is just 'too sensitive'
(ala inexpensive) or if its just plain bad luck.
 While my explaination of CLASS is accurate, I am finding that in
practical application it does not apply. The sticking point seems to be
old faxes where you dail and manually press a send button after answer
do not like fax modems ( or at least class 2's) whereas drop and send
faxes seem to work fine.
 Can anyone shed some light on these problems?

to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/GROUP

Getting back to your troubles. Check to see if the fax init string contains
&f. I had some strange problems with my fax/modem card until the service tech
told me about resetting the modem to factory settings with the at&f command.
