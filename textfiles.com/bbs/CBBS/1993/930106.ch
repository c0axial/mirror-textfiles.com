to WARD re: MODEM

I'm still figuring it out, but I'm getting some interesting
results logging in with a new modem, although it could be the
modem. One connection V.22bis, next call Bell 212 with MNP/5.
Curious.

Around Thanksgiving time there were NO IV-M's to be found anywhere. They
have begun to ship units now, but they seem to be moving slowly.
Distributors seem to be getting several at a time. Eventually supply
will catch up, but it seems that with the 'hold' demand grew while the
printers were waiting for the upgrade.

I came across an XT box that consists of 5 mono cards and 256K on the
motherboard. There are 3 ROMS (1 is BIOS)

 There also is a DTMF decoder card with 5 RJ-11 jacks in. When
booting up each screen says SCREEN(1-5) depending on the card. I have
not been able to find the company, ASC Systems to find out if this thing
does anything useful. ANy info would be appreciated.
