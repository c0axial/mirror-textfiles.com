 Hmm, I don't think it is "duplex", but there might be some sort of phone
line like "answer only" or something like that. Hmmm.
 Sorry, I've never heard of such a service. You CAN omit Touch Tone,
which should save - what - $1.50?

to BILL MATTSON re: KODAK CD'S

In your message you did not specify what CD rom you are using. Is it
compatable with Kodak CD technology? Older CD drives are NOT.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/KODAK PHOTO CD

Ward, I found a good program on COMPUSERVE called GWSWIN.ZIP. It is a
shareware program with low registration fee. Seems to work OK. I can't
provide a qualitative eval as I don't really know much about this area.
It showed me all of the photos on the CD and allowed me to crop them,
save them, and convert them into other formats (PCD to GIF, for example)
with no hassle. As one might guess from the name, it's a Windows prog,
and it runs great in WINOS2 under OS2 2.1. I'll check out KODAK, too.
Thanks for the info.

Thanks for the reply.mine's a Toshiba 3401, and it's apparently
compatible with Kodak. See my message to Ward.#46457 I think.

I used the term duplex because I forget what terminology is used by the phone
company. I do know that there is a lower rate for lines used only for
outgoing or incoming calls. I'll look it up and relay the results.
