to MURRAY ARNOW re: R/APPLE IIE PROBLEM

Thanks for your help. Just narrowing it to RAM or ROM is helpful.
And since I usually repair my own computer without board swapping
(I don't have spares), I didn't remember that as a diagnostic approach.
Thanks again.

Msg 46493 is 13 line(s) on 10/13/93 from DARCY EMERY
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: XMODEM CRC CALCULATION

Ward:

 I have a document you wrote in 1982 describing Xmodem. The funny thing
is that I can't get the crc option to work correctly. My calculated CRC's
look nothing like those from the system I am receiving them from.

 Would you have any code sitting about I could have a look at?

 Thanks in advance for your time!

 Best,
