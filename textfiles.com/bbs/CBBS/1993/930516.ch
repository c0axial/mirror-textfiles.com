Are you looking specifically for a custom control that can be used by
dialog editors?  If so, Microsoft look or Borland look?  What's your
preferred message interface?  Buttons for switching month and year?

     Ward is there a way that I can transmit  text to the message
message file without having to type in all of the text.  I have
tried several times with out success.  I have been able to do this
on several other BBSs.  Can you help?  This would a great shortcut
to sending a lenghty message.

to PETE CANTELE re: R/LINE FEEDS

 heh, looks like you don't have an MNP modem. Come in at 2400, and
with MNP, you shouldn't have line noise.
 I noticed CBBS is getting NO CALLS at anything other than 2400. I see
the codes coming in correctly for other speeds, but I'll bet Randy set
the switch on the modem for "fixed speed", so even a 1200 baud call is
coming in at 2400 to CBBS. When CBBS switches to 1200, that hoses things
up. Hmmm.

 > temperature sensitivity
 I had the strangest thing the other day. I opened the lateral mail
drawer at work, and put my hand in to pull out something way deep in
my mail slot (a pendaflex folder). I noticed it was warm. I started
feeling around - bottom of the drawer, adjacent mail slots - I fully
expected someone's laser-printed listing to be nearby supplying the
heat, but I couldn't find it. I started moving my hand around my mail
folder, and was amazed that I could "sense" a temp difference - I figure
it must have been only a couple degrees, since there was nothing around
that was supplying the heat.
 I also noticed how sensitive I am to "radiated" heat.

 I hate to admit it, but "lawyers" is the best solution to your problem.
They should hire a lawyer and threaten the company due to the down days,
and be "willing to settle" if the company will come up with some scheme
to get around the copy protection. I remember having my first MIDI program
be copy protected (and maybe even the one I use now, I forget) - and I
thought: "Boy, this is enough to make sure I never do professional MIDI
stuff - a little glitch on the hard disk and POOF you are D_E_A_D."

Msg 46254 is 03 line(s) on 05/16/93 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/IDE TIMING PROBS. (CONT)

 About all I can think of is trying something like periscope, that
can single-step thru ROM, then trapping INT 13, and tracing to see where
it runs.

Msg 46255 is 03 line(s) on 05/16/93 from MURRAY ARNOW
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/LINE FEEDS

You said that CBBS is taking 2400 calls only. I believe I am logged in at
9600, and I have been calling in at this speed for quite some time. Have
I misunderstood your comment about 2400?

Msg 46256 is 06 line(s) on 05/16/93 from NORB DEMBINSKI
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/WRITE MESSAGES

 The problem that I have has been the first two or three characters
of each line are missing when I list the contents of the message just
after sending it up. I will try a greater pause between characters
the next time I try to send up a message. Thanx for your help.
