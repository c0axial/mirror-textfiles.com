 I think the Computer Shopper has a BBS listing by area - might check one
out when you're in a store to verify if this is still true.

I can do you one better: I've still got a 4-MHZ one lying around (no
plastic box, though).

I've had a chance to play around a little with Voice Blaster, a hardware/
software combo from Covox that lets you use a SoundBlaster or clone for
voice input. It can recognize up to 1023 words at a time (though they admit
that speed and accuracy will be poor with such a large vocabulary). It's
speaker-dependent and requires training. I've had mixed results with it,
but they admit that support for the PAS-16 sound card that I have isn't quite
there. I haven't had time to open up the machine and stick the old
SoundBlaster back in and try it out (it has a test function that lets you
play back the word that it tried to recognize, and I found that with the
PAS it was chopping words up). Cost $69.95 at Comp Usa. Might be useful
for entering control-key sequences or the like without straining the
wrists (it also works well with a word-predictor program I sell). Current
support is DOS only, though they've promised a Windows version.

Yeh.It's the presentation box that really makes it. Consider a trade?
Just kidding. We sure have come a long way since the 1-mhz 8080. Actually
my first was a .5-mhz Signetics 2650 that only addressed 32K, nice
instruction set, though. Built it myself from bare boards. It kind of
troubles me to see all the for-fee BBS's that popped up later on, consid-
ering that the cost of iron has steadily declined.but then we never
contemplated storing gaggabytes of 6-megabyte word processors with built
in harness race handicapping TSR's did we??? Regards.

to ALL re: IDE SPEED/TIMING/LAPTOPS

I have been working on updating a Toshiba 1600 from a 20Meg disk to a
120 Meg disk now for several months. I have left several messages
concerning what I have found out. I hope that this info may help others
who want to do this, and maybe someone will even have a solution now
that I can define the problem.
 This laptop and many of the first several generations produced
all used 20 or 40 meg drives (usually Conner's becasue they had the 1"
packaging first). These were first generation IDE drives (all
manufacturers, which basically combined the ST-506 drive with the
Western digitial controller technology. What is important here is
that: 1) there was no ANSI standard for IDE as there is today;
and 2) the drives used the inerleave value of 3:1
 Today there is a standard and the drives are 1:1 and can not be
reformatted to any other value. The controllers simply ignore these
parameters.
 What ties all of this together are ther BIOS issues regarding
timing on the IDE bus controller. Prior to 1989-90 depending on the
company, the BIOS's did not have to concern themselves with this timing
problem becasue drives were slow. On desktops you can simply
upgrade the BIOS and be done.
 The laptop vendors have gone with cusomized BIOS's that it seems
none of the 3rd party companies have touched. They further have not made
the necessary changes themselves. What is occuring is that with 1:1
interleave and burst mode transfers, the data is coming in from the drive
faster then the laptop's BIOS is prepared to handle it, and at some point
they miss handshakes; the computer waiting for the next acknowledgement,
while the drive has already sent it and waiting for the next request: the
result is a lockup. (which sometimes will retry in 90 seconds or so at the
DOS level sometimes.

 I finally got to the level of removing all upgrades I had made,
and simply swapping the CP-3022 for the newer CP-30104 while only trying
to access the new drive as a 20 Meg drive. It still froze: What is needed
is a patch or fix or a means of upgrading the BIOS in the laptop. As I am
not sure if there is any speed relevant data in the BIOS drive table, this
by itself will not be enough (but it would take care of the drive size
recognition problem)
 A company in Calif. is offering to upgrade this T1600 (286 based)
machine to a 120 Meg drive for $795 (which is just a little too much of
a markup) They will not sell me the BIOS, nor'update' the code on my BIOS
chip.
 Conner says there is nothing I can do to slow down their drive;
Toshiba has no newer version of their BIOS available. Where can I find a
company selling laptop BIOS upgrades, or how much work would be involved
in 'fixing' the current code ??
