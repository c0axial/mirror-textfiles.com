Randy doesn't call CBBS, but I'll forward your note to him. Try chinet
again maybe later Tuesday or maybe Wednesday. then again you didn't
give your ID, hope he can find your logon.

Msg 46231 is 28 line(s) on 05/03/93 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/TAPE IMAGE BACKUPS

 Tape backups seems an area with lots of "issues". For example, Colorado
didn't have an OS/2 backup, then suddenly they did - turns out they were
supplying Sytos. OK, how do you restore? You boot floppies, then restore,
right? NO! Turns out Sytron made it a "PM" (Presentation Manager) appl,
so you have to have a "full, running OS/2" to do the restore! Sheesh!
 This AM I tried running my 486, it told me my QEMM wasn't registered.
So, I renamed QEMM386.sys, and restored from a backup, and compared - sure
enough it was trashed. CHKDSK told me C: was pretty hosed - turned out
TWO sectors got clobbered in the FAT, AND, FAT #2 was "synchronized" (often
I'm able to restore FAT 1 from FAT 2). OK, clean a few things up, manually
"e5" (erase, but without touching the FAT) the cross-linked stuff, zero the
FAT sectors that were hosed. Now it says my tape backup device doesn't
exist. OK, re-boot, try again, it is OK. BUT the tape isn't indexed.
OK, index the tape. Takes 50 minutes. Come back: "a severe write error
occurred on the hard disk, retry?". RATS! What IS going wrong here!
 I turned off Smartdrv write cacheing, seeing if that will help.
 -
 Back to your problem: unfortunately, a block-by-block backup wasn't that
popular or that good an idea because you could only restore to the SAME
drive, AND you couldn't have any new "bad spots", because by NOT being a
logical copy, it couldn't get around bad blocks, etc. Also it was much
more difficult, if not impossible, to restore a single file.
 What I suggest you do is, for example, write your FAT using Norton's
DiskEdit, i.e. you go in with alt-F1 and that indicates Fat 1, then write
to a file (say, fat.1) on A:.
 As to really doing such an image copy, I can't think of a way, sorry,
other than hokeying up a directory and FAT to "point" to chunks of the
disk "or something". Hmmm.Nothing real obvious comes to mind.

 As to whose BIOS they licensed, could you boot debug and go searching,
it might have a Phoenix or AMI copyright or something.

to ALL re: WANTED: CALENDAR DLL

I need to find a windows dll that will allow a display of a monthly
calender, with the ability to click on a particular date, with the
date getting passed back to my app. I've been scanning cserve & other
BBSs, along with commercial packages to no avail. I wouldn't mind if
this were one component of a general function package. Any ideas, please
leave me a message here.
