Msg 46258 is 15 line(s) on 05/17/93 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to ALL re: DBIV?

Greetings, all. I'm looking for someone with the new version of
dBase IV (someone with the compiler). I've recently written a little
application, and I'd like very much to see how it compiles. It's written
in dBase III+ (DBXL, actually, but it's the same thing), so it should
compile under IV without any problems - but I don't have the $ to spend
for the compiler.

So, if anyone out there would be willing to compile a small bunch of
code, I could send you a disk and you could return it, or I could send
the code via Internet.Thanks in advance.

Oh - the program is a little check register/banking manager. I wrote
it because the commercial programs I looked at were serious overkill,
and because the one I tried added 1+ meg of files to my disk. Since I
already had a database, I figured I could dump most of that. :-)

Ward-

First of all, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Paul Chartraw,
and I have been editor of the CBBSList/Stillwaters List for the past
year and a half, and have offered it a 'home' since the beginning of
this year. I have meant to contact you since November or so, but as
you know, things always seem to get in the way of doing what you WANT
to do. I dearly hope that there is no ill will towards my usage of the
CBBS moniker, I understand you 'own' it, and granted it's use as the
filename in the Stillwaters List-era, and hope that you do not have a
problem with it's use as the NAME as well as the filename. The reason
I chose to rename the list to The CBBSList is that simply it was no
longer housed at Colby's system, and he asked me to differentiate it
somehow so that he would not continue to be overrun by the callers, and
it seemed simplest to me to keep the familiar, etc, etc.

Feel free to contact me voice at 708-748-6816 evenings after 6pm, or via
my system, The Hideaway BBS, at 708-748-1911.

Paul M. Chartraw

PS - Ya know, if it wasn't for you, I'd NEVER have had this
 much fun. ('Course, my phone bills'd be cheaper, I'd
 have more time on my hands, I'd stil have most my hair.HMMMM)
