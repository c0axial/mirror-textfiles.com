to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: VESA ???

Ward,
 My information says that VESA stands for Video Extended System Arch-
itechture.
 I have also seen reference to VESA signals on the VGA adapter connector
that is found on IBM VGA cards, and copied by many of the 1st generation
VGA cards by others. I do not know what they may have to do with todays's
VESA.
 Also, with caching disk drives, controllers, system software
(smartdrv, etc.) Netware, and motherboards, have we reached a point where
we are CACHED OUT and actually losing performance by everyone trying to
guess ahead for what we may want? Most seminars I have been to say not,
but with 4 levels now possible in most machines it seems to be possible
that with all of this going on it could take longer to get something than
having none of it, or just one.
