to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/PALMTOPS.

 Gee, no, sorry, I didn't SEE any palmtops! Only spent 2 days, and I
didn't really have a "mission". I heard someone say "I hear Apple isn't
at this Comdex", so I didn't look. Also, IBM was EVERYWHERE - all kinds
of different areas by themselves - multimedia, OEM components (IR LAN, etc),
and other things - but not a pure hardware group (PCs, Laptops, etc).

Ward:

 Thanx for the HP 1200C/1200C/PS report. I just received some infor
mation from HP on the printer. I have priced the machine around Chicago
and come up with about $400.00 off of the SRP.

Msg 46292 is 16 line(s) on 06/02/93 from NORB DEMBINSKI
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: SOUND ADAPTERS

Ward:

 Has IBM anything new in the audio card area? What I am looking for
is something that would be Sound Blaster/Adlib compatible and paly WAVE
files. The card would have an adapter for connecting a CD-ROM audio line
onto the card internally, have a MIC and AUX input, speaker output ( amp-
plified or not) and joystick port. The Sound Blaster that I have hangs
my MS Windows when sarting up in Enhanced mode. I have to start Windos
in Standard Mode, quit Windows, then restart Windows in enhanced mode.
Creative Labs is of no hlep and points the finger at Microsoft and IBM.
Microsoft points the finger at Creative Labs and IBM says it is not
their problem. I have never had a problem with IBM for support or
service. Microsoft has been good to me so far. Creative Labs I don't
trust any more, that is why I am looking for an IBM card. I know what
I will be getting and can sleep at night.

I picked a microcom ZX/2400 external modem and need an outline of
both dipswitch functions,anyone have this or Microcom's address?

Msg 46295 is 07 line(s) on 06/02/93 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/AN INNOVATION.?

Another possibility is that when you had two outputs connected together,
one of them was able to sink enough current from the other to alter
internal thresholds in the driver/receiver chip (assuming it was one
chip with both, rather than the old 1488 and 1489). Maybe the chip
was sourcing enough current into its ground to alter the reference
points (similar to a TTL counter double-counting because the first
count created a current spike).

Msg 46296 is 10 line(s) on 06/03/93 from EDWARD MARSH
to BILL MATTSON re: R/FRIMWARE

Yes I recieved the packet of information and it is the best thing that you
could have ever done for me. I really am surprise on how much trouble
I put you through. I hope I can return the favor sometime. The info
gives me a base to work from. I don't have to start from sratch.
This is going to save time effort and trouble. My only problem is during
the debugging stage, since I can't afford a decent emulator, will be pain-
ful and very time consuming. If you have any bright idea's throw them
my way. This project is going to be rough enough. (please excuse my lousy
 sepellign)
thank you very much :)

Msg 46297 is 07 line(s) on 06/03/93 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to WARD re: NOT THAT INNOVATIVE

Cute, but, alas, no. The innovation, in this case, was merely having
a single batch of wires going to the machine. Induction would be a
cute trick, but I can see that resulting in LOTS of problems :-].

For me, the weird thing was realizing that you COULD put a wire
inside the coil cord without having to slide it through end to end. It's
like those 2-or-3-prong fork optical illusions.
