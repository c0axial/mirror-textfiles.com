Msg 46035 is 12 line(s) on 01/19/93 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to ALL re: PROBLEM WITH MATCHBOOK MODEM

 I've got a problem with a Practical Peripherals "matchbook"-sized
modem. When I start Procomm 2.4.3, the modem plays dead either
1) until I quit Procomm and then reinvoke Procomm, or else 2) until
I press Alt-H ("Hang up").
 I tried all sorts of other kludges: Diddling with Procomm's modem
initialization string; creating a control-string file that is TYPEd to
COM1 before Procomm is called; and entering strings by hand within
Procomm. Among the strings I tried was the string used by Procomm to
go on-hook (~~~+~~~ATH0). None of them work.
 I'd like Procomm to start and run without all this pussy-footing.
Anyone have any ideas on what the problem is?

Does anybody know the location of Visual Technology Inc.
There were located in Andover, MA at one time. They
made the Visual 102. Or maybe they have gone out of business?

Msg 46037 is 03 line(s) on 01/19/93 from KEN STOX
to ROY LIPSCOMB re: RE: MODEM PROBLEM

Is the modem "really" playing dead? or is Procomm not sending data
because it thinks that the modem is not "ready" ? Try changing the
modems setup for line control (eg. AT&C1 )
dup. chars.
