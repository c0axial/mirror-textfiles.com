to BENJAMIN COHEN re: R/GENEVA

Thanks, so far no word on the BASIC ROM. That would be nice, lets give him
a bit more time. Do you have an easy way to make one? Does the Geneva
have a speaker and a sound command like the HX-20?
 One thing I thought would be interesting to use a laptop computer for
would be to take it with you in the car, and have a little timing program
running that would allow you to tap the space bar every time the speedo
went another mile. Then you could come home and plot a speed chart - it
would just be interesting to see what it looks like particularly during
rush hour, etc. Obviously it would be more interesting if it were more
precise - like driven off the magnet on the wheel that runs the cruise
control, so you could see the speed on the tollway, etc.

 I interviewed IBM Research in approximately 79 or so, and I can tell you
there were microcomputers internally, but of course no PC as such - the 8080
chip was still popular, and the Z-80. I was offered 3 jobs, but was too
"anxious" about change, cost to live in up-state NY, etc.
 You mentioned "circa 1970". Remember, the height of microcomputer
technology in say '73 or '74 was the feeble 8008, and the 8080 in 74, etc.
The 80986 - the basis for the PC - was unavailable for several years.

 The IBM Computer exhibit at sci & industry was closed today - no
indication - anyone know what's up?

Msg 46402 is 07 line(s) on 08/04/93 from BENJAMIN COHEN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/GENEVA

Well, actually I don't have a way to make a copy, but I have a friend
who does (Bill Wolff), so it shouldn't be a big problem.

I've never gotten much into the innards of the thing, but there is a clock
of some sort, so it just might be possible. I do have a set of manuals, if
Andy doesn't/didn't furnish any, if you'd like to look at them. [Not to
mention a spare 300 bps modem wedge, rah rah!]

Msg 46403 is 03 line(s) on 08/05/93 from PAT BALL
to ALL re: WINDOWS TERMINAL

When I log on the info comes in waves rather
than one line at a time. Any suggestions?
Thanks

Msg 46404 is 09 line(s) on 08/05/93 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to WARD re: GENEVA

Sorry, no ROM. It looks like I got things well cleaned-out before I
moved. There IS a clock in the Geneva (it's been called one of the
heaviest digital watches in the world) and it should be accessible.
It's VERY accurate; I set it to WWV and a year later it was right on
the $. As for sound - I think so. There is a little speaker next to
the tape drive, and I know that some software will do neat things with
it. BTW, if Antelope Freeway is still in business, they will have
some nice neat things for the Geneva. Or I can give you a list of what
I can find in the Epson area on SIMTEL.

Msg 46405 is 05 line(s) on 08/05/93 from MURRAY ARNOW
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/IBM CIRCA 1970

I am quite certain that my friend told me about internal desktop computers
at IBM around 1970 (give or take 2 years). I left Cincinnati in '73, and
I was told about the desktops in Lexington before I left. At the time I
had no real concept of what a personal computer was, but his remarks about
this "strange" computer stuck in my memory.

Msg 46406 is 08 line(s) on 08/07/93 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to WARD re: STUFF

I spoke too soon! While I don't have the BASIC ROM, I just found the
modem wedge. This'll give you a 300 (WOW) baud modem, plus a 64K
external RAMdisk - so you'll have a full 64K TPA in the Geneva. It
has its own battery that charges from the Geneva's PS, and plugs right
into the Z80 bus on the back of the machine. Along with it, I found
the Portable Calc ROM - a little spreadsheet. I'll wrap this up and
send it off on Monday. Just plug it in and screw it on (and reset your
machine) and you'll like the Geneva even more!
