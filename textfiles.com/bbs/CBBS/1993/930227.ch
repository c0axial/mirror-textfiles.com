to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: COMM ROUTINES

I would be happy to "donate" my interrupt comm routines for a CBBS rewrite.
But, these are not for the general public, as is CBBS source I assume.
There is a nifty program will will shell to DOS and watch for a line drop.
I'll have to scratch my head and search the disks for it.
umm, I remember, Its called REMDOOR, or remote dos door. I have a copy if
you want it.

Msg 46107 is 10 line(s) on 02/25/93 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to TRACI WEISTER re: CHAT? NOT!

 CBBS was done by two people - Randy Suess did the hardware, I did the
software. It runs at Randy's house, 40 miles froml-in Unix system), a chat
would only be for HIM, and not for ME - and 99 of 100 chats were for ME, and
I'm 40 miles away. SO, the help on "chat" does sound kind of discouraging,
intentionally (grin).
 P.S. no, I haven't been on "PC addicts Conference". I don't know what that
that is - I have WAY too many systems I call as it is - CBBS, Randy's chinet,
Compuserve, BIX, America Online.

Ward,
 I use an interrupt driven assembler comm routine that maintains
a buffer of any size. You could call my routine and get a character
back and a status code indicating if a framing error occurred or not.
If the buffer were empty, the status code would indicate that no
character was available. The wait function would be contained in
the calling routine.

]Have been trying to locate the newest DOCS on the XMODEM protocols.
The version I have includes checksum/CRC and a few things on
WXMODEM, windowed modem, ZMODEM and YMODEM - but it does not
give any protocol procedures for these or for BATCH operations
(multiple file transfers under automatic control). I HATE
calling long distance to ask about this, but have no other choice
because my new protocol procedures can't be completed until I
know what already exists (to include them too). BTW, I also
have a valid 6502 assembly code (under 128 bytes) that
generates both a checksum and CRC for any packet-length. Also,
in the docs I have, it lists the prime number for CRC as 69,665
which is not prime, but 69,661 or 69,667 are - are my docs in
error or was the prime incorrectly chosen? Please help me to
get the latest list of the docs, or tell me where I can get
them -- thanks.

to ALL re: C COMM ROUTINES

  If CBBS is going to survive many more significant outages, it will be
necessary to re-write it in "C" for portability, getting away from the
8080 emulating V20 environment.
  I write in old Turbo C 2.0.  Any recommendations for an interrupt driven
comm routine (or assembler callable routine) that I could use?
  Also, I have a real kludge for going to DOS to do file maintenance -
consisting of a bat file, with a password routine, and a CTTY COM1 for
remote access.  It works "fine", but I'm sure there could be something
less kludgy.  I am NOT looking for anything "complete" (i.e. a whole new
BBS system) etc.
  Thanks for any ideas!

Ward,
   First get yourself wrist braces.  They work to immobilize the wrist
to arm, but still allow limited use of the fingers.  Second thing to
do is make sure you have an ergonomic work area, and also get an adjust-
able wrist support for your wrists while typing.
Your doctor can also prescribe some anti-inflamitory type drugs to help
  (these were my observations from last year when my secretary got it
and went through the entire nerve testing, etc, ordeal)
   It also could be tendonidice (sp?)

(Sorry, just not Nearly as knowledgeable as everyone else here I bet.)

Anyway, thanks for taking the time to explain and post the history!
Do you ever jump on the PC Addicts conference?  I'm gonna havta
brag that I called here and that you even ANSWER a lowly prole <Big G>.

I don't think the syntax sucks.  It's nice to do all of that at once!

Okay, well, I'm outa here, thanks again Ward.

I had the same problem with the 1200 baud a few days ago.  Tried to
connect about 5 times and then gave it up for the day.  It sounds like
you still get to tweak the system alot.  How long would it take to
convert it to C?

BTW, I like your "reasons to chat"!  Although I like an online chat
once in awhile, it seems to end up being 2 hours long, and similar
to chinese food - I can't remember having written anything <G>.

  Sorry you have to spend your long-distance money, but the answer is
"I don't know".  I've never seen WXMODEM myself.  If I were to try to find
Y and Zmodem docs, I'd try Compuserve, and Chuck Forsberg, "Mister Y/Zmodem"
is there.  Unfortunately I'm away from my machine now so I don't have my
directlry of names etc.  Chuck is on Portland Oregon if you want to (gasp)
try a VOICE call to him.

  Oh, that's interesting - watch carrier when in DOS ... that IS a problem,
but mostly I type something "dumb" (like COPY CON...) that locks up the system
and Randy has to restart it (heh).
  I'll see what else I find and keep you in mind for REMDOOR.

  Thanks.  Do you know what the right height for a wrist rest is?
  It could be tendonitis (-itis = inflamation of), which I thought carpal
tunnel was a specific variation of - but you're right, right now I can feel
it nearly in my elbow - which is where I got "tennis elbow", but in my RIGHT
arm, not left like this.
  Guess I really should quit screwing around and see a Dr.  But I also need
a lighter touch, more ergonomic keyboard.

  Heh.  You used the "reply" command, but to a msg from me, not from "ed".
Your msg 46098 was to me, but started "hello, Ed".

to TRACI WEISTER re: CHAT? NOT!

  CBBS was done by two people - Randy Suess did the hardware, I did the
software.  It runs at Randy's house, 40 miles from my house.  Since Randy
has not taken an active interest in CBBS lately - because he's (seriously!)
gone on to "bigger and better" things (like a dial-in Unix system), a chat
would only be for HIM, and not for ME - and 99 of 100 chats were for ME, and
I'm 40 miles away.  SO, the help on "chat" does sound kind of discouraging,
intentionally (grin).
  P.S. no, I haven't been on "PC addicts Conference".  I don't know what that
that is - I have WAY too many systems I call as it is - CBBS, Randy's chinet,
Compuserve, BIX, America Online...

  Try the "B" command - the bulletin tells you what this BBS is for.
What it is "about" is "history".  This is the worlds first BBS.  15+ years
old.

  Anyone have any experience with 4mm dat drives?  Like the Archive Python?
I'm looking into one.  I have 520M, and an old used 60M tape drive just makes
it too much of a pain backing up!

Ward,
   I use an interrupt driven assembler comm routine that maintains
a buffer of any size.  You could call my routine and get a character
back and a status code indicating if a framing error occurred or not.
If the buffer were empty, the status code would indicate that no
character was available.  The wait function would be contained in
the calling routine.
   If you're interested, you can get in touch with me through
Roy Lipscomb.  Talk to you later.  R.
