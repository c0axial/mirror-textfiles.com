to ALL re: ONE BBSCON

 Just got back from ONE BBSCON (the ONE means Online Networking Exposition).
This is a BBS related convention. Last year, 1000 attended, this year, just
under 2000. Next year, they predict 3500! I think it will be at Atlanta
 The program started of an opening session, with Jim Warren as keynote
speaker (he has been involved in the industry for many years - Dr. Dobbs
Jorunal, Micro Times, Electronic Design News, etc).
 It then went into optional sessions, two every AM and two every PM, with
some "Birds of a Feather" to round it off in the evening for topics come
up with after the original program was created.
 There was a very large exhibit hall, with everything from modem mfgrs
(US Robotics, Hayes, Supra, Zoom, Xyzel or whatever that strange one is,
etc), to all the BBSs, multi-port board vendors, vendors hooking to the
Internet, PageSat with their Internet news feed by satellite, (and a
competitor giving more - Ilink, Fido, etc, but at $30/month right away,
and not $30/month AFTER 2 YEARS like PageSat).
 I gave a session on the BBS history, kind of expectedly lightly attended -
it was up against Dr. Vinton Cerf, the internet inventor, doing a big spiel
on the internet.
 It was held at the old but nice Broadmoor hotel in Colorado Springs. They
picked up my hotel bill, but I had to do my own airfare.

Hi all,
I'm new to the modem and shortly intend to obtain a 96/96 for business pur
poses. I'm interested in Internet and Usenet etc. I want to learn UNIX
and expand my computer knowlege. I'm formerly an Atari user (64k-8bit/4meg
16bit) Clones since they became afordable. I have Unix 3.2 but need some
info about whether I can format a hard drive half Unix and half Dos, of if
I have to dedicate a machine to Unix. Please pass on any info. Tnx.

Msg 46443 is 19 line(s) on 09/03/93 from ED FOSTER
to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/DBIV?

 This is a little late to join the conversation, but I think I have what
were looking for. Along with the dBASE IV upgrade (from 1.5 to 2.0) for
$99, I also bought the compiler for $199. This may sound like a good
deal, but wait, there's more.
 The Borland dBASE Compiler gives the option of a full, standalone .EXE
file, and a "compact" .EXE requiring the presence of two .RTL (runtime
library) files. In the application I bought the compiler for there are
seven .PRG files, totaling about 31K. The "compact" .EXE file is over
180K, and the .RTL files are 150K and 1.5M. That's right, almost two
megabytes of program files to run this compiled application.
Furthermore, I could not get the programs to run on a machine with only
2M of RAM. Talk about FatWare!
 That said, the compiler does what I bought it for. It allows me to run
multiuser applications on a network without buying multiple copies of
the development system. It's not a speed demon, but it's reasonably
fast under Novell 3.11, and if you have a browse screen up and somebody
else changes a record, after a (settable) interval your screen will be
automatically updated.
 Still want your programs compiled? I'll be happy to do it for you.

 I'll try to talk to Randy Suess, co-founder (with me) of CBBS, to see if he
has an answer on your half-DOS half-Unix issue. Ideally, your Unix might
have a DOS emulator that allows running DOS directly - though I'm not sure
how well they do in a more complex environment - such as I don't think you
can run Windows since Unix would already be the "protected mode" op sys in
your box.
 Could you tell me what you mean by "Unix 3.2"? Not sure that's sufficient
to know what you have - i.e. is it DELL Unix 3.2, or what?
 As to internet/usenet, etc, that's a complex issue. One person to contact
if you really want that direct access, is Karl Deninger. Here's a signature
line from him from a recent message on Chinet, Randy's Unix system. (Hmmm,
you might want to get on chinet, a place to ask your Unix questions, etc -
the guest access number is (312) 283-0559, I think. But $50/yr helps.
 Here's that Deninger signature line:
