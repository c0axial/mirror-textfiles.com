to WAED CHRISTENSEN re: PHONE LINES

Your question about X.25 brought up a peripheral question. Do bulletin boards
use half duplex or single duplex lines? If the boards do not make outgoing
calls, they can get the half duplex service. It is a small economy that can
add up over time. Do you know if sys ops use this option?

Msg 46455
01 ?  Duplex refers to whether a line can send and receive data at the same
02 ?time, - way back when, they would send in only one direction.  Even the
03 ?HST modem "breakthru" was 9600 in one direction, and was duplex - with
04 ?300 or something in the other direction.  I dunno what the phone company
05 ?term is for a line unless it is "answer only" or 
06 ?

Msg 46455
01 ?  Hmm, I don't think it is "duplex", but there might be some sort of phone
02 ?line like "answer only" or something like that.  Hmmm.
03 ?  Sorry, I've never heard of such a service.  You CAN omit Touch Tone,
04 ?which should save - what - $1.50?

  We have a 286 with 82 MB drive that has UNIX (Microport) and DOS.
The UNIX was given about 50 meg and boots from the hard drive.  The
DOS partition boots from floppy.

Ed:

Thanks for the offer, but I think that I'll stick with non-compiled
for now.  I've since learned that DBXL supports some functions that
aren't part of dBASE (such as the APPEND AUTOMEM function) and so that
might cause some problems.  Also, I keep tinkering :-), so compiled code
might not be as useful as I thought.  SIGH.  Thanks for the offer, though.

to WARD re: "POWER" SYSTEM

Ward, have you considered a program to cache the CD-ROM?  I've seen them,
and they should make a big difference in things like 7th guest.
Hey, if you don't like your system, I'll trade you my 386sx for it
(just kidding)...
BTW, I'm playing around with GEOS today, so I'm talking to you over the
GEOS desktop COMM program.  Cute, but mebbe a little too GUI for me to
handle...
