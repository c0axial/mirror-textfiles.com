 I'm wondering if perhaps there is an SL vers of the DX2 - perhaps Intel
has taken some of the SL-learned knowledge of low power, and applied it.
 I'm supposed to be getting a 486 SLC-2 (25/50) notebook soon.
Otherwise, whoo-ie! That suckah is going to be HOT!
 I think we won't be seeing Pentium laptops for a while!

to WARD re: HOT NOTEBOOKS

Well, a friend of mine refers to his DX2 (66) as a room heater with
a built-in computer, but on portables.? The remarkable thing about
the '486 portables is not just the fact that they don't melt, but that
their claimed battery lives are quite long, comparatively speaking.
All that heat means wasted energy, and anything THAT fast is going to eat
power in any event. So what's going on? Have motherboard designs
improved all THAT much?

Thanks for the number. will trying calling a little later today

to ALL re: MEMORY >16MEG

I have begun reading up on memory limitations above 16MEG and am getting
a little confused.
 1) Is this a problem with ALL ISA machines ??
 2) Does it only apply to certain cards and/or disk controllers
 3) DOes it only occur when using virtual memory ???

I have a couple of IBM files and INternet traffic on the subject and they
seem to read that is a problem with certain disk controllers.
It also has problems with DMA/ bus mastering cards ( any type)
 Now my PC has an option to set memory >16M as non-cacheable. also
what if you have 20MEG and set up NO swap file on disk.
 Or finally, is the limitation more generic than all of this, and lies in the
address lines available in an ISA slot (can'nt even find a pin-out right
now). sort of how some 8 bit cards get confused by the addressing of
a 16 bit card ( I had a lot of problems with S3 chips and 8 bit I/O cards)

Msg 46527 is 17 line(s) on 12/11/93 from MICHAEL SHARTIAG
to ALL re: MEMORY >16MEG

As I have tried to increae my understanding of this memory limitation
a little more, I am starting to get this picture:
 Some (usually older) hard disk controllers used to use DMA to transfer
data back directly to memory. (we are talking ISA problem here only)
The ISA bus only supports 16 bits of data and 24 bits of addressing.
ASking for a file or data to be loaded (DMA'd) at an address above
16MEG requires 25-32 bits; no 25th bit hence data is overwritten at the
lower 24bit address.
It seems that this is also a big problem with SCSI cards.
 Now, Istill don;t have a handle onthe following:
1) is it a problem with IDE drives ( do they DMA)?
2) HOw about VESA-LB controllers; they supposedly have direct 32 bit access
to the CPU and memory?
3) WOuld any oother DMA cards ( tape controllers, network adapters) have
this same problem, or do on-board buffers, orlower memory boundaries clear
this problem. ( do the tape backups, Colorado card for example die in over)
16Meg systems.

to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/CPM BASIC TO DOS BASIC?

Andy-
Well, it worked. I'd tried that in the past, but kept getting error
messages when I ran the program. This time, however, I ASCII'd and DOS'd
all the chained files in the program before running, and Voila!, it worked.
I appreciate the suggestion, and the comments about pushing and popping whcih
compelled me to translate all the .bas files before running. Thanks.
But I have another question.do you know how to change the program to
initialize a different printer? I can't find it in any of the Basic
references I have. Lastly, how would one go about printing a report
generated by this program to disk, in stead of to the printer?
Thanks!

Msg 46529 is 13 line(s) on 12/14/93 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to STEVE FARMILANT re: R/CPM BASIC TO DOS BASIC?

Well, one step at a time.
First, what do you mean by 'initialize'? Unless you're running a serial
printer, the output just goes to LPT1. If you want to set up the printer
to do something fancy, like tiny fonts or whatever, you'll need to add
some LPRINT statements to pump out the appropriate code.

As for getting the output to disk instead of a printer, it depends. If
the thing is just LPRINTing it to a printer, I believe that you can just
open a file for sequential writes and change the LPRINT statements so
that the output goes to that file. It's in the BASIC manual, which I
don't have, and in the code for your program, which I also don't have.

What is the software that you are trying to convert, anyway?
