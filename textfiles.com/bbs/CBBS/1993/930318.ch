Msg 46154 is 25 line(s) on 03/17/93 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: SCSI BLUES

 I have been working on a contract with RISC systems, and got "spoiled"
by them doing big backups onto a single 8mm DAT drive, so decided to plunge
in and get myself a DAT (4mm).
 I purchased the drive from APS 800-233-7550 (orders). They said it
wouldn't work on my IN-2000 SCSI adapter, nor an Ultrastor. They recommended
the Adaptec. I ordered it, too. THEN, at a computer club meeting, I was
fortunate enough to get Corel SCSI - sets of drivers to sort of make
"anything work with anything". SO, I got cancelled the Adaptec, got the
drive, and cranked up the software.
 Sigh.
 The software said my IN-2000 ROMS were too old, and when I called for
an update, they wouldn't take a credit card - I had to SEND a CHECK! So
I decided to forget it, and try my Ultrastor 14F controller. Well, I
really blew a weekend on that! Randy Suess offered to try it in HIS
system, and couldn't get it to go, either! BUT it worked FINE with his
Adaptec, so I said "Screw it", and bought a 1542C. Once Randy helped me
get some ROMS mapped correctly, etc (I didn't realize the networking
adapter he'd given me had RAM on it - the config referenced ports and IRQ
only), it has worked well.
 Lets see, getting the story out of order here a bit: I decided to leave
my IN-2000 in to run the hard disk and CD-ROM, with the tape on the Adaptec,
NOPE! Would NOT work! Flakey problems. Finally pulled the IN-2000 and put
everything on the Adaptec.
 So, I'm kind of "bummed" about the "promise" of SCSI.
 Maybe it should be called "Yucky", not "Scuzzy". heh.

Ward - The March 30 PC Magazine, on page 31, has several 'ergonomic'
keyboards, which might be helpful for carpal tunnel. They are split into
right and left and have palm rests. One has optional foot switches.

]AZ: Reminds me of the time there was a file on the CBBS disk -
"George TireBiter was here".  It drove me crazy!  I felt CBBS' security
was quite unbreakable, yet it was there - a file, obviously left by
someone who knew what was going on.  Well, a friend finally confessed:
he edited it LOCALLY on the disk while visiting Randy one day. Heh.

Hi Ward. Have you had a chance to try out the PCMANAGE program and test
it for your disk clean up purposes? Haven't heard much about that recently
so thought I'd ask, and I was curious to see how you made out with it.
