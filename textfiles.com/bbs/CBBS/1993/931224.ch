Jeff Gray would like to know if Stillwaters BBS is still up, or where he
can get a recent Chicago-area BBS list. Please leave a msg directly
to him, please. Thanks!

Msg 46534 is 06 line(s) on 12/17/93 from ALEX ZELL
to JEFF GRAY re: STILLWATERS BBS LIST

 The Stillwaters BBS list is now maintained by The Hideaway BBS
in Chicago's south suburbs at 708-748-1911. It may be downloaded
by guests within the brief time limit permitted. Two versions are
available: CBBS1293.nam (73K, ASCII) or CBBS1293.zip (23K).
 The list may also be found on Randy Suess' Chinet in /usr/public.
New users may logon to Chinet at 312-283-0559.

to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/CPM BASIC TO DOS BASIC?

It's a program that prints a report for a Luria-Nebraska neuropsychological
examination, written in the stone age in CP/M.
By the way, I converted all of the .bas files to ASCII, and they ran
with no problem.I had problems in the past with only converting
the main program, which could not find all of the chained files. Having
converted all 10 or so small programs, I'm up and running, with the notable
exception of the frustrating inability to print to my printer.The program
is lousy with CHR$ commands that alter the font, since some of the report
is bold, some expanded, some compressed print.
I'm attempting to update, literally, the program.Currently, the program
is running with the finest technology of 1970.
.
Thanks for the ideas about removing the CHR$ commands.But this idea would
not work, since some of the graphs would be distorted if not condensed.
As for the BASIC manual.Hey - it just might come to that.

Msg 46536 is 19 line(s) on 12/23/93 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to ALL re: ALKALINES RECHARGEABLE?

Browsing late night TV, I came across an infomercial for a device
that recharges alkaline batteries. The emcee, Dick (I had typed
"Disk"!) Clark, pointed out that this device worked with otherwise-
nonrechargeable alkalines because it uses a very low charging
current, controlled by a high-tech circuit developed by a professor
at McGaw university. At this point, they showed a video clip of
the professor fiddling with some circuit board that was about the
size of an adapter card for a PC. They're asking about $40-$50
for the device, as I remember.
 My minimal electronics savvy leads me to suspect that this device
works by keeping the charging current constant (and small-like
maybe a tenth or a hundredth of volt?), whereas normal battery chargers
are designed to keep the voltage constant (like 1.6 volts?). But I suspect
that the circuitry to accomplish this requires only a handful of chips,
rather than the twenty to thirty that the infomercial implies.
 Assuming such a device is feasible, my question is, Would it be
relatively simple to build such a device from parts bought at Radio
Shack?

to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/ALKALINES RECHARGEABLE?

Roy, battery charging depends strongly on the species of battery. Batteries
that become polarized when they are discharged are difficult to impossible
to recharge because the reverse polarization at the anode and cathode inhibit
charging currents (in effect). Carbon-zinc batteries are good examples of
this. Over 20 years ago I read a NASA paper on recharging carbon-zinc (lebold)
batteries. The author found he could recharge the batteries numerous times
by using a real simple circuit. The circuit placed a small AC ripple current
on top of a DC current. I think it was a badly filtered 1/2 wave rectifier.
The AC ripple apparently overcame the polarization problems. I've often
wondered if these chargers are rip-offs of this circuit.
