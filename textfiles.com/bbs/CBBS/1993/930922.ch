Msg 46471 is 09 line(s) on 09/22/93 from DENNIS DARBY
to ALL re: PS2-70 CMOS

Can anyone help me in getting a ps2 model 70 up
and running. This belongs to a friend and the CMOS
data was inadvertantly lost when the battery was
disconnected. Since he got the machine used from
a former employer he didn`t get the startup disks.
Does anyone know if IBM sells the Startup reference
disks alone and who I can contact. Or is there someone who can get
me a copy of the startup. At this point the C: drive is not
accesible. Thanks for any input.
