]Ward; Any word if you'll have the notebook machine @ the CBBS b-day
party? The Fotoman software is Windows, but should run under OS/2
since its not specific to Win 3.1
Since I am only mildly interested in OS/2 I have not been following
When is 2.1 comming out? Will it be a free/cheap upgrade for us 2.0
folks?
See ya on the 13th!
