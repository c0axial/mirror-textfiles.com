 OK, got it (Monday!) Guess the flood isn't slowing things down THAT
much. heh.
 The tape was a surprise - was there once an overlay showing what the
various keys are? I'll experiment a bit.

Msg 46378 is 06 line(s) on 07/26/93 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: COMPUTER CENTRAL

Went to College of DuPage (COD) last Sunday for Computer Central. Pretty
nice dealer's show, run I think about every two months. A friend bought
a new VGA monitor, I got "7th Guest" a highly recommended 2-CD game, but
I can't get it to work (actually now, I'm installing a new hard disk,
and NOTHING works. The drive won't load ASPI drivers if the CDROM is
hooked up!

Yeah, the tape is cute, no? As for the function keys - they're
programmable (in CONFIG). They default to doing fairly inane CP/M
things like typing out PIP, ERA, etc, but you can make them much
more useful. As I recall, you can embed CRs in the function key lines,
so that a single key can perform complex functions (for example, you
can have it call up the COMM program and set it to 19.2 kbps by doing
something like this: B:COMM^MBD H^M. It just stuffs the keyboard
buffer and off it goes. Anyway, I guess the Geneva DID come with a
tiny slip of paper that used to fit in the window, but it was "user
oriented" - blank in other words. You could make one up to show how to
use the keys for the tape, I guess, but there IS a cryptic representation
of the keys at the bottom of the SYSTEM screen as well.

to ALL re: MEMORY UP NOW 125%

Forget stocks and gold, I should have been in SIMM futures. .
I just was quotes SIMM proces today at 125% of their price about 3 weeks
ago. This is crazy, but on a 4meg system this has added over $200 to the
cost of a machine. someone is making out like a bandit.
