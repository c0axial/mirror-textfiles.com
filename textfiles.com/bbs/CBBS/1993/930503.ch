to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/IDE SPEED/TIMING/LAPTOPS

Ward,
 Close isn't even the word. The BIOS table to large drive extender
works fine. (although it does generate over 1024 cylnders, but thats not
a real big deal today). I also tried a SEAGATE 3283( 245 meg drive)
The results were the same. Both eventually failed.
 The drive will work some times. It will always boot and format, etc
Where it hangs up in particular is Windows install, eventually running
windows, and in DOS XCOPY. This all seems to relate to large amounts of
data moving from sequential sectors on the drive, and the drive being
too quick.
 In all cases the PC drive access LED is on bright, and the drive shows
no activity. In DOS, a time-out / read error sometimes occurs and you
get a re-try message and can continue.
 As for the 20 to 40 meg change: AS long as it is an OLD ide drive
(1st generation) there will be no problem. Conner only made 20 & 40's
befor ethe changes I am running into were made ( no used drives to pick
up that might solve the problem).
 Does anyone know who's BIOS code TOshiba licensed for their laptops?

I turned MY Horizon on a couple weeks ago. I was looking for an old
mortgage program I wrote once upon a decade ago. I had a LOT of trouble
remembering how to get a directory with North Star DOS, after having
gone through several disks trying to remember which one was configured
for the machine.back to PC-ville. Hey Ed? Stay outta trees!

to ALL re: TAPE IMAGE BACKUPS

As the quality of software and performance has increased we have moved
away from some of the ways in which things happened. One such example
that comes to mind is tape backups. At least the units I was famimliar
with did tape streaming, and simply put each block out to the tape: No
directories of files, individual recall, etc. (basically for crash
recovery only)
 I am now playing with a hard drive that lost its FAT and was
'virused' in some way. It would be real noce to be able to back it up
to my colorado tape unit in a streaming mode regardless of what the data
is so that if I make some progress but mess up, I can put each and every
sector back on the drive and start over ( or to the last backup before
I hypothetically messed up)
 Right now I'm doing nothing but examing for fear of the above. Is there
software out there of this nature. On a side note it would also remove
the weaknesses of Novell in that it will not allow itself to be backed
up, but must be re-installed.

Hey - Steve I still have myN* Horizon. I haven't turned in on for
over two years. I believe in North Star DOS LI is the command to
list the files on the disk.
I have three North Star museum pieces. I wating until the "Collector
items" become valuable.
For now it's back to my 486 with lots of RAM and os/2.

randy, chinet is kicking me off. i'm flummoxed because i'd just
changed the final 'eval' line in my .profile, trying to start up
in elm instead of pico, and when i logged back in to test it I
got kicked off "elm not found" (i guessed the wrong path, probably)
but *then* i logged in as newuser, and got booted *again*. so is
everyone getting booted by a global bug? if it's just me, can you
repair my .profile? thanks. Jorn
