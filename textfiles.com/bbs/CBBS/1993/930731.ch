to MICHAEL BRENNAN JR. re: R/TALK TO ME

 Looks like you had a bunch of line noise in your last call. This modem
supports error correction (MNP) so if you can come in at 2400 baud with
error correction, you shouldn't see line noise.
 All that came thru is "load programs and how to chat with another computer".
 I'm afraid that isn't enough to go on. If you mean load programs HERE,
that doesn't apply - this is a message-only system - the first BBS in the
world, and its "history" is being preserved by not changing (pleanty of
file transfer BBSs around). "Chat with another computer"? Sorry, just
don't know what you mean.

to WARD re: 1ST BBS QUESTIONS

Dear Mr. Christensen,

 I am writing a short article about BBS's for a new computer magazine in the
 'region' called Computer REGISTER. I always like to include some historic
 perspective when writing about techincal stuff.

 My first computer was an Osborne 1 and I was aware of your contribution of
 Xmodem and setting up the first BBS. I just didn't know any of the details. I
 asked one of our writers if he could sleuth around on the internet to find out
 some more details. This eventually lead to finding the number for your BBS.
 (You may be getting email from Mike DeVore.). All this time I imagined that
 you lived in California!

 So I get my facts right, is it true:
 1. You wrote Xmodem (checksum), the very first PC file transfer protocol?
 2. You also wrote Xmodem/CRC?
 3. You set up the world's very first BBS in 1978?
 4. You and Randy Suess together created the first BBS?
 5. The first BBS was called "Ward & Randy's BBS" and ran CBBS at inception?
 6. The first BBS operated at 300 baud?
 7. You conceived the idea of a computer bulletin board system?

 I also would very much like to know:

 1. Who are you, what do you do? (A nuclear engineer? Professional hobbiest?)
 2. Where did the BBS idea come from? (College project? Vivid dream? Sci Fi?)
that instead? Thanks. Steve Culver (414) 786-8731 voice 786-9194 fax/bbs-sysop
. I ascii uploaded this, i hope it is legible. Thanks for reply.

to ALL re: NEED HELP TO READ DBF'S/ ETC.

Is there a book that tells how various packages format the datasets they use?
I know other software can read and produce data bases that DBASE uses.
Does anyone know the name of such a book, the publisher, and who carries it?

Msg 46387 is 03 line(s) on 07/30/93 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to WARD re: 1200 BAUD NOT OPERATING HERE?

For what its worth, CBBS will accept a call from a 1200 baud
modem, but after doing so will only talk at 2400 baud. Some
recent changes to CBBS that introduced a slight problem?
