Hey ( light bulb lights ), I got an idea. I noticed the other day
on USENET that AT&T Paradyne was running a "sysop" program. I
wonder if they woudl be "interested" in "donating" a new modem to
the world's first BBS??

Don't know if this is along the lines of what you're looking for, but
there's a program called PC-MANAGE (I believe it was put out by PC-Magazine
or such), that will PKZIP files that haven't been used after a specified
time automatically. When a file is called that has been zipped, it will
be automatically uncompressed. I haven't seen it around lately, but I do
have a copy of it somewhere and can dig it up if you're interested.
