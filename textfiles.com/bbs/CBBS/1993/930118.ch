 Well, carpal tunnel is getting to me - my left hand hurts, back of
hand "tingles". It is time for voice input! Do any of them really work?

Dragon Dictate really does work, although it has its quirks (when you're
getting started with it, it will often come up with truly weird guesses
as to what you're saying, though you always get a chance to correct
them). VoiceType from a company that you're probably quite familiar
with works pretty much the same (Dragon did the program design), but
has a smaller built-in vocabulary. All of these are discrete-word
recognizers; you have to pause between words. They're also memory
hogs.

A number of companies are now coming out with multiple-piece keyboards
where the pieces can be oriented to whatever angle keeps the stress
off your wrists.

Maybe I should write a TSR that measures the rate and number of keystrokes
and pops up a "give your wrists a break" message if you've been going
at it too long. Part of the problem is that your tendons swell up
more if you don't give them a chance to recover; if you take appropriate
pauses, you can get away with a lot more abuse.
