]Heh, I dunno what happened to cbbs either, but whenever I can't logon
Randy gets a msg on chinet if I can logon there.  Fix comes pretty
quickly.  I suspect he has some sort of alarm on chinet to announce
the receipt of newmail -- cuz Randy often responds quickly to msgs
even if he is showing "idle."  Of course, he could also be working
on an "invisible" console -- but I hold to the "alarm" theory.

Thank you for responding to my question. I also appreciate the sarcasm
about my typing errors. Where can I find this publication. I find that
dealing with Motorola, or trying to get any documentation, or data books
is like trying to pull teeth from elephants. I waited a month to get info
on the new micro contoller series. Some of MOE's componenets have a 40
week lead time. I know the MOE 68000 series has been out for eons, but
in my specific application, I need to use the processor. I have never
used this processor, but I have used many others. I would like to cut down
some of the time it will take me to develop a monitor. If a monitor is out
there then why try to reinvent the wheel? Thanks for some info.

That little beauty is dated 1980. I just might have a copy, though.
Bet you thought I memorize old technical references. I can let you have
a copy of my copy, cheap. Leave some sort of contact info here, depending
on what you are comfortable making public, and I'll arrange to get it
to you. Might take a few days, but I can beat 40 weeks. Regards.
