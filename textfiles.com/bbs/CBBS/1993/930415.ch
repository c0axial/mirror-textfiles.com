to ROY LIPSCOMB re: CARPAL TUNNEL

 I don't think carpal tunnel is permanent - mine is five times better
than it was - just like my Tennis elbow went away after a summer of not
playing.
 Smart: I have started typing a LOT less, using the control key less
(kills my productivity).
 Dumb: I have not sought professional help for it.

to NORB DEMBINSKI re: CONNECT OK?

 Was that it? Were you able to get in OK? I see a 2 minutes call from
you on 4/8, so that makes me think that was it.
 It looks like there have been NO 9600 baud calls. at least no
SUCCESSFUL ones - no "9" entries in the log (I log the speed).
 I see the days of 1200 baud are GONE, too! NO 1200 baud calls!

to ALL re: VESA IDE CONTROLLER

I am noticing that VESA slotted ISA machines are now entering the realm
of reasonable and cheap. At this time I find 2 types of cards that are
available: Video and disk controllers:

 Having CPU direct 32 bit access for video cards I can see the
benefit of ( while the cheaper ones support 24 bit color) Does one
then believe that the 'true VESA" cards are 32 bit color, and 2M ram?
 As for disk controllers: (ISE & SCSI) with and without cache:
I guess I can see where the cache being 32 bit memory and directly
accessable will speed things up; but as far a direct data recall off
of the hard drive, I don't see this being any faster. Data still comes
of off IDE & SCSI drives 8 bits at a time (right?)
 If ths is correct a non caching VESA controller would be a total
waste of money.
 Do I have all of this in perspective folks?
dup. chars.
