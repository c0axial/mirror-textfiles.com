to ALL re: MOVIES & COMPUTERS

 Just got back from seeing Jurassic (sp?) Park. Special effects: Great!
 Apparently many movie techniques like J.P. & morphing in Terminator II,
are done on computer.
 But I have a question: what is the OUTPUT device? I mean, how can you
do something with a computer, and when shown on 70mm or 35mm on a huge
movie screen, not look like it was computer generated? Is it, like,
4000 x 4000 resolution or something like that, and filmed in multiple
exposures, i.e. one for red, one for green, one for blue - so that they
don't need a "shadow mask" which would show up?
 I've bought some large pictures like of Mandelbrots, but you could see
the shadow mask.
 Thanks!

It is possible to transfer a computer image directly to film with laser
imagers( medical images are reproduced to a high degree of resolution this
way). I assume that it should be possible using the same technology to make
multiple exposures of an image to get color reproduction. The latter is
strictly a guess.

I've had a number of computer boxes done of late. They design the entire
package on a computer, the computer does the color separation, and the
computer outputs directly to negatives. In my case the boxes were done
at 2400 dpi on negative sheets that are 3 feet by 2 feet.

From what I've heard, movies are done in the same way, only they have
special computers - the resolutions are higher than 4000 dpi.
