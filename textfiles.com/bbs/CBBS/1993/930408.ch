Ham/computer-fest season is starting (as soon as the snow goes away!)

Wow. I'll tell ya a guy spells a few words wrong and never hears the
end of it. I guess that is the price I must pay for such a mistake.
Yes! I am very interested in getting any info. I can send you a self
address envelop, or if that is too much trouble, You can leave the article
at your favorite library, and I can pick it up. Which do you prefer? Do
you have something else in mind?

Thank You, Edward Marsh :D <- big smile !

Nice to hear about the pizza party and the 15th Anniversary.
I just junked a 1979 North Star Horizon. An example of a great
product in search of any kind of marketing and sales help.
So it goes. Be well, my friend. I'll check in again next year.

Ed: Tell you what.call my office at 708-575-8600, ask for me.
Bill Mattson. I won't be there. Ask for my voice mail if they don't
put you into it right away. Leave me a message with your address, and
I'll mail the copy to you, or if you want to talk leave a phone #. The
voice mail is a good way to communicate. See ya.

There used to be a message on here that was a list of BBS phone numbers.
Is that message still here? (I couldn't find it) If not, does anyone
know where I could get such a list? or suggest some other local BBS's to
check out?
