]Heh.  Meanwhile, news release from EFF recently posted might be
interesting.  Sent it to you on chinet.  The CFPconf is widely
discussed on the WELL BBS and that is where I got the little item I
first used.

to DAVID JOHNSON re: R/DISK CLEANUP

Sheesh, I completely forgot about it! One thing I try to do to manage
what I have, for chinet, is to have a fully qualified subdirectory that
matches chinet. Thus I have a directory: D:\YAM\CHINET\USR\PUBLIC that
had the file in it - it was sort of "invisible". I forgot to put it on
my "todo" list.
 My apologies for the effort you put in then I dropped the ball!
 One thing I DID do to help manage my disk, is to buy a REALLY big tape
drive - I can back up everything multiple times to one tape. Heh. I'm
thinking of BLOWING AWAY the system, and being more systematic: like
Randy Suess recommended - Windows in its own dir, with NO applications
under it; etc. That way you can blow away a root dir entry. (though
I could just as easily blow away \win3\coreldrw, etc.).
 I'll try to remember to take a look at PCMANAGE!

Don't know if this is along the lines of what you're looking for, but
there's a program called PC-MANAGE (I believe it was put out by PC-Magazine
or such), that will PKZIP files that haven't been used after a specified
time automatically

01 ?  Uh, OK, I cranked it up.  I didn't "trust" it so I put it on my laptop,
02 ?but I couldn't get it to do anything.  Perhaps I didn't have a large 
03 ?enough file.  I'll experiment more.  Just to have it record the last ref
04 ?date for a file would be useful, but the limit of 100 is a SEVERE limit -
05 ?I have for example 300 files in several directories.
06 ?  Ah, but come to think of it, there is source, and I could change it...
