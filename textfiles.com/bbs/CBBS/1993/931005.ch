to JIM THALE re: R/OLD TERMINALS

Good luck selling the oldies. I've got an ASCII crt, also! I think the
frame is cracked from where I used to whack it with a board to get the
jitters out of it! (Tried REALLY hard to find the connector or whatever
was doing that!).
 Your msg upload didn't work - you have to allow a short pause @ beginning
of each line. 1-3 chars were cut off of most lines.

Msg 46484 is 05 line(s) on 10/03/93 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ABU BAKAR re: R/PAY RESPECT

Welcome! (Should I call you "sysuser"? Heh I'm "Ward").
 Yes, I'm sure you're the first Malaysia call. Lucky you got in,
since CBBS seems broken and only does 2400 baud. Yes, no files. With
a single line, that's the best way to keep it open for messaging folks -
as I've felt since it went up in '78.

Msg 46485 is 08 line(s) on 10/05/93 from PETER MCKENNA
to ALL re: UNIX COMMANDS FOR DOS

My partner and I have developed a suite of Unix commands for DOS because
we found the DOS command set limiting after working on Unix. We are
planning to market 'DOSNIX' by uploading a subset of the commands as
shareware to various BBS's. Any suggestions for the best one's? This
is my first time on CBBS and from the description of the hardware, doesn't
look like the place for a software archive - or am I missing something?
We will also FTP our shareware to servers on the internet. Know some
good ones? Thanks1
