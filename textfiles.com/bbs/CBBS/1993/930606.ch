]I am calling from a Macintosh computer.  When I tried to kill a scan
listing, I used the "k" key, and it didn't work.  My keyboard doesn't
have a control key.  Therefore, what key can I use to kill a long
listing.  I'd appreciate any information you can give me.

to ALL re: ANYONE IN 312-545?

 Randy Suess may move to the Southwest - I'd like to keep CBBS going
at its current number - anyone in the 545 area of chicago willing to take
on a bit of history?

Msg 46301 is 05 line(s) on 06/03/93 from MICHAEL SHARTIAG
to ALL re: NEED VGA TO NTSC OR RGB

Can anyone reccomend an external device for converting VGA (in some
cases EGA s possible) to either RGB, or a composite output signal?
S-VHS may even work).
 I need the original VGA monitor to continue to function, even with
whatever swithcing goes on; preferrably 100% external ( no TSR drivers)

Ward:

 This is to be put in my 8580-111 that has been upgraded to a 486-33
with SCSI for the HD, CD-ROM, and 3.5" R/W Opt drives. The Sound Blaster
works but has problems with Enhanced mode Windows.

Ward:

 The SRP of the HP 1200C is $1995.00 and the 1200C/PS is 2395.00.
The street price is about $400.00 cheaper on each model. The largest
size paper is 8.5X14 same as the HP LaserJet models. I think that HP
will probably come out ith another model in about six months called the
1800C and the 1800C/PS that will print on 12X18 paper or B-size. They
have developed larger ink cartridges for the 1200C and I believe that this
is a prelude to a larger paper size. The printing speed is also up on
this machine, faster than the DeskJet 550C. What do you think?
