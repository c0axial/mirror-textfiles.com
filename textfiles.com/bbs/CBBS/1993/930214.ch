to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/CPM TO DOS BASIC CONVERTER?

Thanks for the reply.as a matter of fact, the program runs under mbasic, but
there are several programs on the disk I have that I don't understand the
purpose of, such as MDM720 (which I haven't even thought of since I sold my
Kaypro
and 22disk, 22nice, and some other CP/M commands, like DDT (saved as DDT.CPM
on the disk). There are several chained files that are used by the main
file in this program, all of which can be listed. I'll try to save them as
DOS ASCII and run them under GWBasic. Thanks for the tip!
By the way.10 years or so ago I sat in front of that computer for hours
banging my head against the screen trying to figure out how MDM worked.
It was a blast from the past to see that program on the disk. You wrote the
original MODEM program, didn't you?
