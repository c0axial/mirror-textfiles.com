 Thanks! Interesing stuff! Now that you've got "CLASS" figured out,
do you know what "GROUP" is?

to ALL re: DJ INK CARTRIDGE ABRASION

 The last ink cartridge I used in my DeskJet 500 printer started
misfiring on a set of contiguous dots. Using a loupe, I examined
the head for clogged jets, and found none.
 But I did discover that there were gaps in several of the
electrical traces on the outside of the cartridge. The gaps seemed
to be the result of abrasion: They were on the plastic backing where
it bends around the cartridge; and the closer they were to the
left (leading) edge of the cartridge, the wider they were.
 Looking over the previous five cartridges I had used, all but one
exhibited the same type of damage.
 Has anyone else observed this type of damage?

to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/CHIP PRICES

The reason chip prices are jumping is that a big plant in Japan(?)
went up in flames. This plant produced 60% of the epoxy that is
used in chip manufacturing. The entire electronics "foodchain" is
affected by this until alternative suppliers come on line.
