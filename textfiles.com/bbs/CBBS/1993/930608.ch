Msg 46308 is 07 line(s) on 06/07/93 from BILL MATTSON
to ALL re: FOR SALE

I have an ALR Veisa 64K cache memory board for sale. Reasonable price.
I upgraded. This board will improve throughput on a 386/33 by 50%.
Similar results with 486/33. I used it with both. In perfect working
condition. Guaranteed to work as advertised. Works in any of the
Business Veisa, Power Veisa, or other similar systems. Cash. Leave a
nessage here if interested, and we'll discuss it. First reasonable
offer will be accepted.
