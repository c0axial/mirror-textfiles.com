Yep, the final (fourth) day of CES-Sunday, 6 June-is open to the public
this year. If you need further details (or would like to visit during the
MUCH-less-crowded trade-only days (3-5 June), give me a call. I can be
reached at (312) 939-3300 most weekday afternoons. Unfortunately, I am
lucky to call to the few local BBSes I still follow more than once per
month, so I probably won't see a reply here till after the 6th <smile>.

Hi Ed, I just read your message to Ward. I still have my North Star
computers, but they have not been turned on in years. I can't afford to
keep then and I can't consider throwing them out. THe Dimension doesn't
work. Alas, I bought a Northgate. Recently I upgraded it to 8 meg of
RAM. Remember the days when a meg went for more money than your
yearly salary?
Keep well!
Donnie

Campbell in Chicago. Doors open at 8:00 AM.
Hamfesters on August 8th at the Will County Fairgrounds. See above for

6:00AM)
Then you have the Computer Central shows which are held at
The College Of DuPage on the corner of Park Blvd and College Road
in Glen Ellyn, IL. The hours all start at 9:30 AM and go to

No problem. You put the mike inside your gas mask. ;-)
By the way, is carpal tunnel syndrome permanent?
