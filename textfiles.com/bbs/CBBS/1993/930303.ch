 Hope you don't mine me changing the subject from "Welcome" to "Internet",
seems more appropriate.
 Please define what you mean by "ON" the internet. Do you want to do
anonymous FTP, telnet, rlogin, etc? Or just be able to send and receive
email from other folks?
 Fellow CBBS-inventor Randy Suess runs a Unix system, but he may be
shutting off access- seems he has some problems with his internet feed,
and may have to "buy" one and limit access.

Used to have one here, but sorry, don't have it any longer. I went
into Magellan to search on "bbs list msg" and found a hig:
 "call Stillwaters BBS (708-403-2826)"
 They have the list we used to carry.

 Gee, I'm getting Carpal Tunnel answering that question, seems the 15th
anniversary is generating a lot of "tell me how it all started" messages,
heh. Sorry if that came across negative. I should have a "canned answer"
for you, but I don't.
 Actually it all began simply because the technology was there - i.e.
Randy Suess (co-inventor) and I each had an "extra" machine, Hayes had
come up with a hobbyist modem that could be computer controlled, and I
had the skills to write the thousands of lines of assembly language code
to make it all happen.
 I conceived it as strictly a message system, in spite of the fact that I'd
invented what became the XMODEM protocol about 6 months before. This
was because file transfers would be a significant impedement to the folks
wanting to do messaging. To this day, this system still doesn't support
file transfers (except for myself to back it up or upload new versions of
the software).
 As to how it has changed over time, well, THIS system is a bit of history
and really HASN'T changed over time.
 I have a lot of ideas for the future - for example, why not allow true
"meetings" to be done electronically. Lets take a computer club for
example. Ours has a "random access" period in which people can talk about
anything they want, then we have a formal speaker - or a panel of club
members, etc.
 So, I ask myself: can this be done ONLINE? It would have the advantage
of being more ecological - people not having to drive - and could be done
in a way that a real meeting couldn't - i.e. it is often too hard for
"everyone to make it on the same day and same time". Folks could prepare
"presentations", with the BBS downloading graphics, etc. In an "ideal"
environment, they could make annotations on the graphics, or point to
something and ask a question, etc.

 Thus the idea is, you could, via BBS, take something that exists in
"real life", and make it more accessible (people need not even live
in the same area nor be in the same time-zone). Handicapped people are
particularly freed by BBSs - we had a guy on CBBS for years when it
came out that he is deaf - yet really a full BBS participant. (not
that it solves ALL handicapped problems - though one day I did help a
blind guy get a speech synthesizer going on his computer, so he could
participate in the BBSs).
 Libraries: Hmmm. There could be an effort to find the BBSs that
specialize - such as a geneological based BBS. There are many BBSs
dedicated to specialized hobbies - not all are sort of "pure computer
geek" oriented like this one.
 -
 My first job was in a library - we rented the upper flat in the family
two-flat to the local librarian, and I worked there for a couple
enjoyable years. My how things have changed - from a totally paper
card catalog, etc - to - well, I guess it depends upon the budget what
the limit is. I imagine some day libraries - at least their reference
abilities - will be replaced by CD Roms and "jukebox" players - people
can search electronically very quickly, and pull off citations electronically
perhaps to a diskette for inclusion in their word processors, etc.

Tony, the photos look good, espcially the one of Marie. Now if I
can only get them printed. (CSHOW doesn't have that option
in the unregistered version; I haven't tried VPIC yet.)

Boy, being on a computer monitor is almost as good as being on TV!

Ward,
 I don't have any idea what the ideal height is, but from the typing
wrist suports I have seen, they sit infront of the keyboard, and are
basically level with the height of the keyboard case. Quill, Office
World ( Max this week?) all have these things. Some have adjustable height
It sounds like tendon infalamation, buy hey, " I'm not a real doctor, but
I play one on TV." Thats where I ended up; with a brace and anti-
inflamitory drugs.

to ALL re: TELL US ABOUT YOURSELF

 HI. CBBS usage is going down - partly because of the long time it was
down, but partly because it is somewhat "boring". Well, lets start by
telling a little about ourselves.
 I guess I'm willing to talk TODAY, because this week IBM did some massive
cuts - I think St Louis went form 800 to 425 or something like that! I
don't know about Chicago - only know of two people who actually were
declared "surplus", but I'm sure the number is more in the dozens if not
hundreds.
 I am happy to say I "made the cut" so WILL be able to celebrate my
25th anniversary with IBM this June 17th, in spite of the fact that budget
cuts have done away with the somewhat extravagant dinner they used to
throw. I think I'll just ask some friends to come to the BangKok Thai
restaurant to help me celebrate.
 I will be working with the Media and Distribution industry segments
(RR Donnelley, Leo Burnette, Jewel, Dominicks, WW Granger, and a list of
a dozen or so) and will specialize in high-end servers (minimum 486).
 IBM re-accounted something related to vacations this year, so I would
now have 12.5 EXTRA days to take! Not bad! Time to start putting in
some 4 days weeks (i.e. only 40 hours, not 50, heh).
 So, tell "us" about you! What are you "into"? Work, hobby, whatever.
 Hobby-wise, I'm into C programming, enjoy toying with Ray tracing programs,
CAD, etc, and am a "Lantastic" fan.

Ward,
 Thanks for the help. I'm sorry if I'm one of many inquiring minds,
but I do appreciate your taking the time to talk about the start of
your system. I am still amazed by the possibilities that telecommunica-
tions opens up and see my profession as a librarian changing radically
in the near future. Unlike many of my colleagues, I am excited by the
changes and anxious to help others utilize the technology effectively.
Thanks again, Janet
