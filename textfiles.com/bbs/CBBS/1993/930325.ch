to DAVID JOHNSON re: PCMANAGE

 Well, I let PCMANAGE/DCOMPRESS finish - sadly, it has some problems.
It blows up - "file alocation table bad, drive E" which is my RAM disk
for frequently executed programs. Only by putting dcompress last does
it SEEM to work.
 There is a newer version - 1.1 - on compuserve, but it still has the
same problems.

Msg 46164 is 02 line(s) on 03/23/93 from DONNIE STUHLMAN

There were ads in periodicals and catalogs. I believe even the
DAK catalog had an ad for a voice mail system.

Msg 46165 is 07 line(s) on 03/24/93 from BORIS KUKSO
to ALL re: TANDY PRINTERS QUESTION

 Hello! I got a Tandy DMP-202 dot matrix printer, it emulates
IBM proprinter X24, but on all printouts it feeds out 1 extra inch of
paper, which is very inconvenient. Someone said, that all Tandy
printers do that, but there is not a word about it in the manual.
Does anyone know if it is possible to turn off this feature, or is
this set forever and ever.
Thanx, Boris.

]Alex: Did I ever answer your question about "tail"ing a file on CBBS?
It is "type-nn filename" Sorry, funky logic, but that's how it worked.
__Actually there was (programming, not USER convenience) method to my
madness: if I'd made the command "type -nn filename", then the logic
that scanned the first operand as a filename would instead pick up the
"-nn" as a filename.  BUT since I only look at 4 chars to match a
command, the type-nn was just "seen" as "type", and the filename was still
the first operand.  BUT then in the type routine, I go see if there's a
"-" after the type command.  A TRUE HACK, to minimize the coding.  Sorry
for the inconvenience.
