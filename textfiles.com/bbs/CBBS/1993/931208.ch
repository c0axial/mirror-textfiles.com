Has anyonw noticed that the new releases of notebooks are 'packing'
dx2 chips ??? I am wondering how they can keep these things cool
enough to operate without frying the insides or having a meltdown.
Take the TI with the DX2/66 in it: A regular one has a heat sinc and a mini
fan built into it. No way that can fit inside.
