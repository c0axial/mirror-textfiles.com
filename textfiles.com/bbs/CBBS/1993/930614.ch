]Ward...
I am a news reporter for WHO-AM radio in Des Moines...a 50,000 watt
news-talk station.  Right now, I'm preparing a program on the latest
wave of arrests of BBS operators.  As the "father" of the BBS system...
I'm curious as to your reactions...and would like to talk "voice" with
you on the topic sometime.

If this is possible, could you let me know?  Thanks.

]Now that Randy has announced it officially it's time to think about
the future of this place.  I would have no trouble putting it up
but it would have to change numbers since I am not in the same
central office.  I am in Lakewood exchange, same as Ihnat.  Probably
a number of people could be found in the regular exchange area.
From his announcement I gather there is no BI
BIG rush, but it would be well tho give the whole matter some thought.

to NORB DEMBINSKI re: AUDIO SOLUTIONS BOARD

 Sorry, never heard of it. I wonder if it is up on IBM FAX yet? That's
a do-it-yourself system where you call 1-800-IBM-4FAX, and grab the index
(7 pages last time I checked - some months ago) then you call back and
request any detailed publications by 4-digit number. If you're interested,
give it a try. I left myself a note to check on the board for you.

I heard another humorous tidbit from the trivia game, the question
asked was what is the current winning entry from the obfuscated C
coding contest. Apparently, one of the folks from apple immediately
responded, "Windows/NT." Everyone had a good chuckle, except the
MC, Bill Gates.

Msg 46318 is 10 line(s) on 06/10/93 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to NORB DEMBINSKI re: R/AUDIO SOLUTIONS BOARD

 OK, I give up - our multi-media folks never heard of an audio solutions
board, and I checked IBM announcements and found no such thing.
 Do you have any more details?
 The only thing I found that was even close to audio related and recent
was the "Mwave WindSurfer" - which isn't Soundblaster compat - it is a
multi-function board with telephony (answering machine, etc) and things
like 8 voice synthesizer, etc. It IS on the fax system, but I don't think
it is what you wanted.
 OOps, I have access to the FAX INDEX, and looked for "wave" and didn't
find anything!

to WARD AND RANDY re: LONG TIME AGO

Hello hello hello. Its been a long long time but u were the first bbs that
I ever used. About 7 years ago I had a DEFENDER unit with a 6 in. monitor
that was borrowed from work to dial up a mainframe at Comm Ed. I thought
that if I could dial up a main frame - why not a BBS. I read about your
BBS in the Sunday paper and it had the phone listed. Since then its been
two computers and thousands of BBS that me and my son Tim have logged on
to. Thanks Guys - You are the greatest and the BEST and deserve a place in
computer history !

 Take a look at PC WEEK Vol 10 No 22 dated June 7, 1993. The
article is IBM announces audio board for multimedia on page 30. This
is the best that I can do for now. The announcement is from the IBM
Entry Systems Technology group. The article goes into some detail.

 I have copied the article from PC WEEK and put it in the mail to you.
You should receive it at the office on Monday or Tuesday of this week.

Well, I guess I keep my fan. I opened up the case and the '386sx was
warm to the touch. At least I've moved the machine so it isn't QUITE
so noisy.

Msg 46323 is 09 line(s) on 06/13/93 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to ALL re: LAPTOPS

I'm looking to buy a '386sx laptop. I sort of fell in love with a
Toshiba Satellite, model 1850 (25Mhz, 4 M RAM, 60 [I think] meg disk).
it was around $1300 or so.

I want this machine for DOS (DR-DOS actually), not windose. Anybody
tell me whether I'd be making a mistake with this critter? Or can
anyone recommend a nice alternative?

Thanks!

Msg #:?rep
Msg 46325
01 ?  Well, I'll just say that I'm very pleased with the 3 Toshibas I've had.
02 ?They are NOT the best price-performers, but definitely generally good

]Ya, gotta think something about CBBS.  Maybe just move it to my house,
since the number is going to change anyway, and it isn't like there is
any listing for CBBS in the directory, etc.  I really should rewrite it
(Gee, have I ever said that before?) to make it more maintainable!
