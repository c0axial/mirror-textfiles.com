Msg 46660 is 09 line(s) on 05/31/94 from PAUL STREETER
to WARD re: VIRUS DETECTOR

This virus's footprint is that when CHKDSK is run, there is a line that
should say 655360 bytes of memory available, or something like that. My
stunt was to include "CHKDSK >DATASET.TYP" in AUTOEXEC.BAT. We have a
BASIC program run in AUTOEXEC to put batch files for a menu on a ram drive.
I modified that program to scan DATASET.TYP, look for that line and check
it for 655360. -I left out a sentence. The virus makes this number
be a smaller value. - When the BASIC program finds a number not
equal to 655360, it displays a polite but emphatic message and goes into a
loop. Crude, perhaps, but it worked.

Hi Ward,
Thanks for taking the time to reply. Sorry it took me month to get back
on. The 1:3800/1 is a Fido Zone/Net/Node # of a BBS I run in Baton Rouge
using Maximus software. But it all started with CBBS tha you and Randy
first made avaiable in 1978. Thanks again! and I glad to see that you
are still keeping it on line. Will you be in Atlanta for One BBSCON?
If so, hope to get a chance to meet you. Stan Brohn

to ALL re: CD-ROMS AND SMARTDRV

Smartdrv does not recognize my CD-ROM. The manual (creative Technology) ref
fers (oops) to using it without any details. When I try to maually
activate the drive letter, smartdrv will not take it.
 I'm using DOS 5.0. Am I missing the boat here? Are there other options
I should pursue ?
