Heh, that will be cute. It IS interesting seeing the Geneva, thinking
about it being the next generation after my HX-20. I still suspect a
bad cell in my HX-20, should take it apart and see.

What do you mean, comes in waves? You mean you get say 6 lines all at
once? That's probably because Windows isn't that good a multi-tasker
(like OS/2 is). SO it takes time away from your program for a while,
then gives it enough to print what has already been received.

to ALL re: DIVERSIFIED TECH-COLOR CATCHER

A freind pickup upa large blue box ( alnost looked like an IMSAI)
The box and assocaited stuff says: Diversified Technology, Inc.
Color Catcher, the internal cards and the back say: @1986 Frederiksen &
Shu Laboratories Inc.
There were 3 PC/XT cards ( 8 bits) with a switch that setup for XT vs. AT
(so AT's existed) It takes a 50 pin twisted pair ribbon cable from the card
to the box (only one connector)
It takes NTSC in, and output RGB, SYNC, Sub-carrier out and NSTC out.
I'm sure it had software but nothing came with it. I have been able to
locate a Diversified Technology in the south somewhere but they only
make industrial rack mount computers and never made this:
 So what I need is:
 Can anyone tell me what this thing does/did ? (is it worth even
pursueing)?
 ANy phone number for this company or who ever might have bought
them out ?

to PAUL STREETER re: R/NEED HELP TO READ DBF'S/ ETC

Ward was on the right track in his reply.The two books that I believe
he meant are File Formats for Popular PC Software and More File Formats
for Popular PC Software, both by Jeff Walden, Wiley Press. The dBase
format is covered in the first of the two.
 Note, however, that both books were published a few years ago. In
some cases, that means the info won't help with contemporary files. (The
dBase format info will handle the vast majority of dBase files kicking
around these days, thogh.) The other importance of the pub date is that
the books are not out of print. But full-service bookstores like Kroch's
can help; they ordered my copies well after the books were out of print.
Of course, a larer library is another option. <s>
 Good luck.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: THE WRITTEN RECORD

Ward,
 I had the pleasure of stopping in at the new Borders book store
near my home. Quite a nice selection of computer books and reference
material ( although they were all at cover price)Aodbe Postscript
reference, Microsoft's library of developer books, etc. Even an
expresso caffe.
 To the point, I found at least one author who did his homework
and gave not only the correct reference for MODEM & XMODEM, but also
the idea, thought, invention and creation of the world's first BBS
system, (even had the name right CBBS).

to ALL re: MCIMAIL->ATTMAIL/LAN

we have our MSmail system up and running with a gateway to ATTMAIL.
I can exchange mail with compuserve via the X.400 interface, and the
internet too. I would like to try and figure out how to exchange msgs
with someone on MCImail - or even better, a LAN with a gateway to MCIMAIL.
