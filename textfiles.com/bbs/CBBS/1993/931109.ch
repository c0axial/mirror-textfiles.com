Msg 46505 is 08 line(s) on 11/05/93 from ABU BAKAR
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: GOOD CONNECTION

Nevermind about the speed, i can get a clean connection and that's very
good. I've read the TRUE history of how the BBS was born through a local
BBS which put the article in bulletin section. it's sure a long way. BTW is
this BBS program written by yourself? Pretty simple but if u can install a
quoting system in the message entry will be great. Tell me, how many users
are there in the system?

Bye!
