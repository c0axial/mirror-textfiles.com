Msg 46047 is 13 line(s) on 02/01/93 from DONNIE STUHLMAN
to KEN STOX re: R/RE: WHY DO 486'S GET HOT

Hi Ken,
At a CAMP conference about a year ago I asked an Intel engineer
about when Intel chips will reach the physical limit of the universe.
His talk was on the future of Intel chips and he demonstrated how the
number of transistors per CPU has increased dramitcally. His answer was
that Intel has a long way to go to reach the theoretical limits of
known materials. I think all these heat problems are demonstrating that
Intel and other chip makers will come close to the physical limits
of the known materials faster than we can predict.

Keep in touch. I now work in a brand new building in Deerfield. The
company is ISAC. (We do student loan guarentees among other activities.)

Dunno what you were trying to do, but it came out all garbage. If you
want to leave a msg on this BBS, please make it straightforward and
simple. Youe "CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE[[[[EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\" was totally
meaningless. I must assume it is "ansi graphics" or PC hi-bit chars,
which CBBS strips to 7-bits to ensure compatability with all machines.
