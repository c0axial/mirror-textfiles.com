]hELLO,
I just stopped by to see if I could find the numbers of some local
BBSs posted here.  I'm from out of town and would like to occupy my
time in my hotel room by telecomputing with local boards.  If you have
a list I can't find it.  If you would leave me a message here I would
appreciate it. I'm looking of a number that will be able to provide
me with a local list of BBSs with varing interests.  By the way, I
got your number from Boardwatch Magazine.  Thanks in advance,
Chad Fletcher

]Hi, my name is Janet Balas and I am a systems librarian at Monroeville
Public Library. I am also a contributing editor for the magazine,
Computers in Libraries and write a regular column on telecommunications.
I try to make librarians aware of the resources available to them through
telecommunications, especially through bulletin board systems. An upcoming
issue will be devoted to microcomputers and I thought it would be
interesting to talk about "how it all began." I would like to mention
this BBS and your work. Would you be willing to provide me with some
background material on why you started the BBS and how it has changed
over time? I would appreciate any help you can give me. Thanks, Janet.
