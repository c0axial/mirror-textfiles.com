questions after prelim logon -- usual: name, address, zip, phone,
pulled the plug when it wanted birthdate.  Figured it would be
endless.  Mebbe when I have more time.

to ALL re: ALL 2400 MODEMS EQUAL?

I have two 2400 modems, 1 ext and 1 int, the ext is much faster.
Can anyone tell me of a program to test the speed of these.
I suspect the int modem is not really going 2400.
