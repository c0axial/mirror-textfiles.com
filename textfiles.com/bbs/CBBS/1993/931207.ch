to ROY LIPSCOMB re: DJ HICAP

I've seen refills for it, so it must be. At least one of the
refills for the high capacity cart includes a specially modified
cartridge, whatever that means. I dunno; at $22, it's almost not
worth the trouble. I just had one run out after six months and a lot
of paper. Of course, I print mainly text; if I were doing more graphics
stuff, I suppose it would have run out sooner.

Ward, have you received the PX-8 wedge yet? I'm sorry it took so long
to get it off to you; school started here and between the class I was
teaching and doing childcare at home, it got to be a tad busy.

Msg 46513 is 09 line(s) on 11/18/93 from MICHAEL SHARTIAG
to ALL re: READING NOVEL 2.X HARD DRIVE

I have a LITTLE problem. Without getting into a lot of detail, I need
to be able to directly read the contents of a Novell ELS 2.15 level II
hard drive with something similiar to Nortons.
 My memory recalls that the boot track contains a boot loader, and
that the entire drive shows up as a non-dos unit and CAN NOT be accessed
via DOS or any DOS utility.
 Anyway around the non-dos problem? Any other way to accomplish the
same feat? I need to be able to search for a character string on the
drive.

Ward.

Hadn't heard from you and thought that maybe you had decided to not
discuss with me a possibility that we could see you at BBS EXPO!

Hope that isn't the case. because I think that you would see that
the part of BBSing you started is what we are aiming at with this
EXPO. getting back to the basics of BBSing Today and Tommorrow.

Please leave me a voice number to call you and I will be glad to
get in touch with you at hours you feel are the easiest to reach
you. or. I can be reached all week at home starting at 4pm
est today. 609-231-1757.

Happy Thanksgiving day and thanks for considering talking to me about
our upcoming BBS EXPO in Washington DC on April 5, 6 and 7 of 1994!

Talk to you later or will check back here for a number to call you.

Thanks again.

Msg 46515 is 13 line(s) on 11/24/93 from AL HIGGINS
to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/DJ HICAP

I was able to peel the top off several cartirges but one needs to be
carefull. I placed the cartridge on its side and used an exacto knife
to score a like down the seam where the cartridge is glued together.
After the line was scribed, I was able to find a few small places
where I could get the blade all the way through. Then I used a hammer
and tapped the exacto blade down the cartridge, and was able to pop
it open. Sometimes it wont pop clean and leaves a raged edge. I used
a new exacto blade and cleaned it up, or a dremo drill. Occassionally,
you will find one that's impossible to open, they used ALL the glue
on that cartridge that they left out of the others. I've also opened
the color cartridge, and have refilled it three times. Once you refill
it, use a little ruber cement to hold the top on. Works great!
Have fun!

Msg 46516 is 05 line(s) on 11/24/93 from STEVE FARMILANT
to ALL re: CPM BASIC TO DOS BASIC?

Anyone out there know a way to convert an MBASIC program file so that
it can be read and executed by DOS's GWBASIC??? I've got a great program
that I currently use with 22NICE, but it's too time consuming etc. to
use the program this way.
Any info would be greatly appreciated.

Msg 46517 is 01 line(s) on 11/25/93 from PETER ZELCHENKO
to STEVE FARMILANT re: R/CPM BASIC TO DOS BASIC?

Say, are you any relation to Janine Farmilant?

Msg 46518 is 15 line(s) on 11/27/93 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to STEVE FARMILANT re: R/CPM BASIC TO DOS BASIC?

Well, depends on what needs converting. It sounds like it runs with
22nice, which means that it can't be very hardware-dependent. If it
isn't peeking and poking a lot, you just load it up in MBASIC and
save it with a new name, followed by a comma and an A. That will save
it in ASCII format. You should then be able to load it in GWBASIC,
since (as far as I know) GW is pretty much a superset of CP/M
MBASIC (after all, GWBASIC is a MicroSoft product!).

The one reason that you're having trouble now is probably that the
program is saved in tokenized form to save disk space. The DOS BASICs
do this too, but use a different format than do the CP/M basics. Once
you have the program in ASCII form, you should have no more trouble.

You might even be able to get it to run under QBASIC, which would make
it even nicer.

Msg 46519 is 22 line(s) on 11/30/93 from RICHARD PAQUETTE
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: BBS EXPO

Hi Ward.

Realize that you are busy and probably get many messages daily bugging
you to do one thing or another. I hope that you aren't looking at us
in the same fashion.

Hope that you have received the past few issues that I sent to you and
that you had time to look them over a little to know where we are
coming from (or trying to anyway! <GR>).

Would like to talk with you. I had suggested that you leave a voice
number for me to call you at our cost. if that isn't ok. maybe you
could call me collect either at my office: 609-953-9110 or at my
home office before 11pm est. 609-231-1757.

Hope that the "commercialization" of BBSing hasn't turned you completly
off! BBS EXPO would not be the same without your presence and that is
what I would like to talk to you about.

Thanks for taking the time to read this.
