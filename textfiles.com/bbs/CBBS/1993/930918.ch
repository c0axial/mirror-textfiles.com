to ALL re: SCSI

Some things I think I've learned:
 - fast means 10mb (normal is 5)
 - the drives and controllers adopt - agree - on the lowest common speed.
 - WIDE means 16-bit. At least in IBM, you can get 16-8 bit converters to
 run old 8-bit drives on a "wide" controller's ribbon cable.
 Anyone know if SCSI II is the one that supports 15 devices?
