to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/MEMORY >16MEG

Another issue is Smartdrv - it has to read stuff in below 16M - called
double buffering or something. Causes some problems.
 I still have only 8M, so not a problem and would probably go to 16
as my next step - I THINK I can go higher, but - as you're proving -
too many headaches if you don't need it.

I dunno how they handle the heat, it is truly amazing. Maybe they put
a thermoelectric pile in and use the heat to charge the battery ;-)
