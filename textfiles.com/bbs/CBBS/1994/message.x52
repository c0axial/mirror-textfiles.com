IDE INFO,
I've been hearing from the fidonet echo (old messages) that those IDE
controllers hides bad sectors it finds from MS-DOS. It was also said
that those controllers reserve good tracks to replace the faulty ones
when they are known. One even mentions that you should never use a low
level format on a IDE hard drive. Is all this true and can anybody
tell me any more information about this? It's all news to me! My IDE
drive died before I used a low level format, then it worked for awhile
after, then died again after 24 hours. I doubt that this was related to
the above news, at least I hope not.

R/IDE INFO,
  Well, I'll open the bidding (on answering your Q's) with a LITTLE bit
of info - others will supply the details (grin).
  Most IDE drives use ZBR - Zone Bit Recording.  This means that the
number of sectors/track varies!  The purpose is like the older Mac floppies:
to keep the recording density more constant.  Since the inside tracks of
a hard disk (or floppy) are "shorter" (in circumference), it makes sense
to slow down the clock a bit, and write at the same BIT DENSITY.
  This means that a format program that builds a traditional WD type
controller TRACK in memory then does the track format, won't work.
  Some IDE drives will be hosed up by a low level format.  Some will simply
return a response "Done!" when in fact they didn't do anything.  AND, a
FEW are truly low-level-formattable.
  I don't have details (I don't know which drives are able to be low-
level formatted, etc).

R/TELEBIT QBLAZER MODEM,
Thanx for the info.  I had used the QBlazer for a trial period and liked
it very much.  I decided to return it because it did not have all the
features I may want in the future.  I had noticed that I could
trade my old USR HST in for a new model for just a few $ more and
have the ability to upgrade in the future if things change.
I appreciate your comments about the QBlazer.

CRC ALGORITHM?,
What is the specific formula or algorithm that produces the CRC of a file?

R/1.44 FLPPY NOT SUPPORTED,
Check out the DRIVPARM parameter in your DOS manual under CONFIG.SYS.
It tells you how to alter the parameters for any of your floppy drives.
One caution:  If you set the parameters for 1.44 MB, you may not be
able to read 720K diskettes; and vice versa.  The solution would be
to use DRIVER.SYS to define one density, and DRIVPARM to define the
other.

R/CLONE AND DRDOS,
Yep -- keep it!  DRDOS is a clone of MS-DOS; it's virtually
identical -- so don't think of it as 'different' from MS-DOS.
Just think of it as the NEXT version of MS-DOS.
