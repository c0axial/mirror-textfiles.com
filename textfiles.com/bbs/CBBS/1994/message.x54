R/IDE INFO,
That makes a lot more sense to me! Thanks!

486 UPGRADES,DEVO
I'm in the process at looking at 486 motherboard replacements. Does
anyone out there have any comments on AIM vs. DTK vs. Micromics or others.
If I'm going to spend the $$$$ I would like to make a good choice, and
not just a clone maker that makes a motherboard with a 486 chip in it!
It appears almost all the boards use AIM bios, and some boards can
address 16 MB, some 32 MB and others 64 MB.  Any comments??

QUESTIONS ABOUT DOS 4,
I don't have a copy of DOS 4, but I need two items of information to
complete a utility program that displays the DOS errorlevel for DOS 3+:
   1)  What is the exact offset (from 0H, not 100H) of the byte in
   DOS 4's COMMAND.COM that holds the current errorlevel?
   2)  What are the first three bytes of DOS 4's COMMAND.COM (at 100H)?
Thanks.

OS/2 SERVICE PAK,
Hello OS/2'ers,
  As you are probably aware, the long awaited Service Pak (AP) is now
available via electronic downloading. If you don't have access to a
IBM SE and don't want to pay Compuserve the $200 to download the 20Mb
of diskette images I have an alternative solution.
I have both the 3.5" and 5.25" images and would be willing to produce a
copy for anyone who would supply the required number of blank diskettes.
It requires (14) 3.5" or (16) 5.25" diskettes. I live in Morton Grove, Il
which is just north of Chicago (9500 N and 7300 W). If you think you'd
like to make the treck out here some evening give me a call and we can
set up a date and time.
Days- 708-317-7485

R/1.44 FLOPPY NOT BOIS SUPPORT,
  DRIVER.SYS in your DOS manual talks about the various drive settings -
depends upon the version of DOS... I DO know that early AT's could NOT
have a 1.44M drive without a special driver - which was not readily
available.
  My DOS manual is so old (at least the one I have handy) that it
doesn't address 1.44, sorry - check your manual.
  P.S. would you mine just a couple space indents on a new paragraph?
makes the msg more readable.  'preciate it!

R/1.44 FLPPY NOT SUPPORTED,
DRIVPARM wasn't ever defined by IBM, so PC-DOS doen't have it... but
of course has DRIVER.SYS.  DRIVPARM was nicer in that it didn't take
more memory...
  P.S. if you can think of any folks, I'd sure like to get some old
CACHE folks at the Chinet/CBBS 15th anniversary party on Feb 13th.
I'm in tough with Krystosek, Precht, Suess, Roger Hale, can you think
of others you're still in touch with?  Oh, Randy and I were trying
to remember, just popped into my mind: "Bill Basset".
  I'll check out one of the old listings - I think I've got one back to
the late 70's, but not sure.
 Best offer for all.
