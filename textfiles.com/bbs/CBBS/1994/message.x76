2 SCSI DRIVES AND OS/2 2.0,BLAH
Is it possible to add a second hard drive to a SCSI host adapter
that is using the IBMINT13.I13 driver in OS/2?	To be specific,
I'm using a Procom Technology CCE-16 adapter in my generic
386sx-20.  I have an ST-296N 83 mb hard drive, and I'd like to
get a second one.  Should I expect any problems?

Thanks

R/2 SCSI DRIVES AND OS/2 2.0,
  I know people having trouble with an IDE and a SCSI as D, but dunno
about 2 SCSI's.  I'll ask around.

R/DISK FORMAT SOFTWARE,
Don't have any suggestions, but one of the things that I have run into is
disks formatted by PS/2s to 1.44 megs WITHOUT the benefit of the second
hole punch that is "standard" for high density 3.5" disks.  Apparently,
I'm told, IBM doesn't recognize the IBM/Sony standard in the PS/2s (or	at
least didn't originally) and since 'DOS will format to high density
unless you tell it not to, the result is a disk that can't be read
on non PS/2s without punching a hole in them.  FUN!

WHAT COULD CAUSE THIS,
A client of mine has a Micropolis 1664 330MB ESDI drive with an Ultrastor
controller card (the one with the small cache), and a Colorado 250 tape
drive with controller (i.e. not using the floppy controller).  These were
originally installed in a 386DX-16 system and were moved to a DX-40 some
months ago.  Since the transplant, the client noticed that tape backups
were taking significantly longer.  While looking into some other things,
I ran Norton SI and got a disk performance index of only 2.9 (the reported
seek time was about right for the drive, but the data transfer rate was
reported as zero) and the test took quite some time to run (no caching
software was installed at the time).
Has anyone run into something like this before?

AT&T YEAR PROBLEM,
Andy, thanks for your response to my question.	I was waiting to
actually change the battery before I thanked you, but I haven't gotten
to it yet.  So thanks in advance!

LINE NOISE FIXED../MA BELL,
I received a present from Ma bell on Thursay... They left a message on
my answering machine telling me that they had fixed the problem with
my 545/777 connections.  There was a problem with the return trunk to
Highland PArk via the Kedzie (and/or possibly another location)
switching station.

	I have had 100% error free connections since then.  Within 1 week
of asking for a supervisor with each location (HP and Buffalo Grove) I
was able to get an answer other than "we found no problem" and actually
get it fixed.

	If anyone else was having line noise problem and its clear now
you were probably feeding back through the above mentioned station.  What
nailed the problem down was that any call I made to a 545 or 777 prefix
modem was a bad line.
