]CBBS dying?  If you mean cuz of low usage previous couple days, that
may be because it was not responding a couple days until Randy reset.
Mebbe weather is a factor?  But what is with Ward/Dolton CBBS?
Haven't checked it in a while and it didn't respond this morning.
Anyway, thought you were in Wiconsin this weekend.

Did you hear anything from the Windy City guy about your letter
in my behalf?

Msg 46585 is 10 line(s) on 02/27/94 from KEVIN PRECHT
to ALL re: ASKING ABOUT GATEWAY COMPUTERS

I am curious, has anyone had any experience with Gateway computers?
I am looking to buy in the next few months, and I just wanted to know
if anyone has one, and if they are impressed with, or can't stand
it. Also, if you have one, have you had any trouble with it? If so, what kind
of trouble. In addition, has anyone had any experience with Western Digital
Hard Disk Drives? If so, Good/Bad/Indifferent?

Thanks a lot!
