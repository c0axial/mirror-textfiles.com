COLORADO TAPE DRIVES,
  Anyone have experience with these drives?  Specifically, I went from
a 120 to a 250, and I'm getting way too many errors on the 250M tapes-
on the order of 300, to as many as 1400.  I just bought a new 3M 2120
tape, and will format it to see how it does.
  Thanks for any ideas.

32-BIT DEVELOPMENT,
  I have now sent off my order for the IBM workframe and Cset/2
compiler.  Got the books - WHEW!  47 pounds!  Actually a friend (Mike
Warot) liked 'em so well he bought 'em off of me and I ordered another
set of 'em.

CBBS,
  No, heh heh, no multi-tasking here.  Curious what you observed that made
you think that...
  Scrolling too fast?  I thoughts about that have to do with comm packages:
most have a capture buffer with scroll-back capability - for example I
receive my entire CBBS "session" then scroll back to see what people
said - I can scroll back even when entering a msg (like now).
  The lack of screen pauses are to encourage quick reading - perhaps even
capturing and calling back...
  Nevertheless, while I don't like the stop-every-screen idea (control-S
works very nicely - at least if I'm in that mode I'd rat er it stop when
I want it to, instead of stopping in the middle of a sentence, etc),
THERE ARE SOME SOLUTIONS:
  -- If you want to read every msg since you last called, use the r command
and give a msg * which will read the first new msg since your last call.
Only one message.  Many/most will fit on one screen, or you can ^S to stop
to read.  Once the header has scrolled by, if you want to skip it, hit ^C.
Then when you want to read the next msg, just type "." - "." goes ahead
one message, "," goes back one.  If you have one you want to reply to,
type REPLY instead of . or , - that's. it.
  -- If you'd rather flag messages, just hit enter at any time, and CBBS
will ask you for "msg # or #;#;#" and you can type in the msg # you want
to retrieve, or several msg #'s separated by semicolons; and you don't have
to repeat the leading digits: 45816;7;21  would get 45816, 45817, 45821.
When CBBS says "A pause to flag last message" you can hit enter, and CBBS
will ask for this list of msg #'s, and you can sit as long as you want
(Well, CBBS will bug you in a minute or two to please go on) and type the
msg #'s.
  The main thing that is missing is the ability to continue reading the
next message after using the REPLY command.
  Hope this helps!  Thanks for your comments.

R/AUTHORS AND HISTORY,
  Wow!	Small world!  I'm doing X-windows programming, too!  Though
"not really" - there are some more experienced people than I, so I'm
just doing more routine "C" and they're doing the X-menus, etc.
  Audio cards: I'm interested to know if one can record real-time stereo
to hard disk, and could edit out the "pops" inherent in my old vinyl discs.
(grin).
  Wolfenstein: I bought it, but I don't have a sound board.  It is really
nice, eh?  The program is pretty nice.
  Nice hearin' from you.  When I said you "call in now and then", I didn't
mean "infrequently".
  I guess I was more thinking of the few and far-between msgs from you ;-)
  P.S. what Unix systems are you on?  I'm on an IBM Risc System 6000.

CACHE,
  Were you in CACHE way back when?  Think there would be an interest
in getting some of the "old timers" together for a 15th year CACHE
reunion?  Actually, maybe I should consolidate CBBS's 15th anniversary
party (Barnaby's on Touhy, 2:00 PM, Sat Feb 13) with a CACHE reunion!
  Hope you can join us.

R/DISK CLEANUP,
  Any idea what the TSR overhead is - and how they keep track of the last
usage date of a file?
  Thanks!

R/MODEM,
  hehe, could be!  Actually I have an HST that is merely in need of having
the power cord fixed, it shouldn't be that big a job.  I think they use
a standard DIN, so I can "finish the Chop Job Randy started" and cut the
cord completely and see what wires go where - even with one loose wire,
4 should be OK and 1 not, so I can figure what goes where.  I'll make
a note to at least put that on my to-do list!  Actually, a V-32 would
be nice, too!
