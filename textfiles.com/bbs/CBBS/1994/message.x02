R/MEMORY INTERLEAVE,
OK, I get it.  What machines have this feature?  I don't think
I've seen it widely advertised.  And of course, that brings in the question
of how to define 'wait states.'  My 325s has '0' wait states set in the
setup, but I gather that it ain't necessarily so.  Can you amplify
thee distinction for me?  Thanks --

CD ROMS,
I'm interested in installing a CD ROM. I'd appreciate some input on
manufacturers, performance, and standards. Since my knowledge is very
primitive all comments are useful.

R/DESKJET,
  No, can't say I saw it as faster than an LJ, but then again I've never worked
with an LJ.  Perhaps what happens is you see output STARTING sooner.  Are
you saying it is faster to COMPLETE a page?
 > Utility to setup the DJ:
  Well, yes and no.  I went thru the book when I got my first DJ, and
used my editor to make 1-line of each font change that was supported -
then I got the idea to make a "program" out of it, which means I could type
"fs" (Font Select), cursor to a particular description (such as "Courier
6-point 20 pitch"), and press enter.  This sends the set-up string to the
printer so that next application will print in that font.
  However, the "program" is a custom version of my PMATE editor, so the
setup program isn't really portable.

R/DESKJET,
I mean it comes out faster{  I think this has to do with the
fact that the LJ has to wait until{all is in memory, and the{
get going and prin{ the page, whera3{ the DJ just spits it ou{.

InxD any event, faster output.	No kidding.  I'qve also written my own setup
program, using 4DOS's batch extensions.  If you haven't used 4DOS,
you haven't lived!  In any event, problem solved.

I love the DJ, though.	I now have the Prestige Elite math cart in it,
and that works nicely, though I had to learn another wrinkle in PCL to
get everythingtto work!  (point sizes!	Since there's an inter{al
12 cpi font, you need to specify point size to differentiate).

This is a rather noisy line, so I think {'ll end here...

MODEM,
I'm still figuring it out, but I'm getting some interesting
results logging in with a new modem, although it could be the
modem. One connection V.22bis, next call Bell 212 with MNP/5.
Curious....
