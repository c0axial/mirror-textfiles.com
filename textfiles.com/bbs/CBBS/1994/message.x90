R/HELLO FROM RUSSIA,
I was delighted to see your messages here.

Most of my work these days involves writing for computer magazines,
including a column about international computer issues which is
syndicated in England and Australia. Because of this I have set up and
keep in contact with about 300 sources around the world.

Through that process I of course have learned quite a bit about some of
the questions you raised in your first message here--too much for a
single message, in fact. We could continue exchanging messages here, if
you plan to continue calling; but I sometimes can't call here for weeks
at a time.

One option might be to use my BBS (in the same city as this one) at
312-939-4411 (up to 2400 bps), which I monitor several times each day.
Another possibility might be via Internet, which you mentioned. But it
will depend what local node you use to access Internet. Some nodes in the
Commonwealth countries are extremely expensive--not for you, but for us
in the States. The reason is that WE get billed for messages to you AND
from you--and all are quite expensive. So if you currently have personal
access to Internet, you might leave your Internet address here or on my
BBS. I'll respond with one message on Internet despite the costs. (I'm
sorry to be particularly concerned about this, but with the large network
of international callers I constantly maintain at my own expense, I must
be!)

I look forward to hearing from you and exchanging messages, whether here
or elsewhere. I'll respond to some of your questions and perhaps you
would be kind enough to respond to some of mine for use in my column.
     Best wishes.

INTERNET,JWOA
Just a quick addition to your comments, in case others try to use them....
	From CIS and other systems, you must remember to precede the
Internet address with a ">" redirection symbol--followed IMMEDIATELY by
"INTERNET:....." (A few systems will generate the redir symbol for you
and remove extraneous spaces, but CIS doesn't.)
	Secondly, you of course correctly showed the correct address
format for messages back TO CIS (other than the ">INTERNET:" preface
which most systems require that you enter manually), but it bears
emphasis that the comma in all CIS addresses must be changed to the
period which Internet understands. (Most systems WILL do this
conversion for you <smile>.)
	On a separate note, glad to hear the IDE woes you mentioned here
and on my BBS are fixed.
	Regards.

CRC-32 (CCITT),
Can anyone give the slow algorithm for CRC-32 (CCITT)?

INTERGATED VOICE,DEVO
Does anyone out ther have any experience with PC add-in cards that will
provide Voice Mail??? I have found several products recently, however,
I have found verry little  discussion in the trade mag. discussing the
topic. The vendors I've found are:
Prometheus - The Home Office. $299 or 539
The Complete PC - The Complete Ans. Machine $399
Natural MicroSystems - Watson - $249
Talking Technology- Big Mouth $ 295
 Most of these cards provide the basic answering machine tasks, have a
built in modem and some can do FAX sending.  What I'm looking for is
a board that will allow me to provide a general greeting, followed by
an option message, based upon the message, the customer will be able
to input a selection (1-4) for a more detailed msg.  I have the MFG
technical data sheets on all the products, however they all clame to
perform just about the same features. (Except Big Mouth it can perform
outbound telemarketing).
Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated bucause i'm at the point
I need to make a decision and purchase one of them.... If anyone would
be intrested in the results once I've purchased one, I'd be more than
happy to share the experience with them....

R/DISK CLEANUP TIP,
CED -- OK, but it can't do what 4DOS does!  But on the other hand, you're
right.	When I'm working on someone else's machine, it's a PAIN not to
have the stuff I'm used to.

The BMT file I set up for 4DOS sets up the DJ500 in a neat way (I think):
It gives you a menu for basic functions (reset to [my] defaults, set
margin, do an envelope, or choose a font).  If you do 'choose a font,'
you get a drop-down menu of all the useful fonts (internal and those
in the Prestige Elite cart), and just highlight one to load it.

I really like the DJ, but HP's PCL is a royal pain at times.  Order of
commands is a real big factor.	Having the ability to just pick a font
off a menu makes it a whole lot easier to deal with.

I keep hearing about PMATE, BTW.  It sounds nice.  I use MicroEMACS
for my main editor/word processor/etc, and recently added a macro to
call a high-speed text searcher (MasterFind) and dump the search results
to a new buffer.  You're right -- given a good hammer...

RE: TOYS,
I didn't get one, but I saw today a little Casio 4300 'pocket book.'
It's nice.  For $69 you only get 32K, but the keyboard is good, th
the whole thing is SMALL (REALLY the size of a pocket calendar, not
a day-runner), and you can hook it up to a PC.	If I had the $$ right
now I think that
is the way I would go.	Oh yes -- the screen is quite readable, too,
and it has a QWERTY layout.
