CBBS BACK UP,
Thanks to Randy being willing to support the "old beast", CBBS is back
up.  Norb Dembinski even beat me in on the first call - minutes after
CBBS went on the phone line!
  Please pass the word about CBBS(*).  I know, it is old, but it like a ride
thru history, and I AM working on re-writing it in a way that can still
be compatible with the "old interface" - perhaps message threading is
the most important.
 (*) meaning, I'd appreciate it if you sent a note to your favorite
BBS saying something like "CBBS/Chicago, the worlds first, is back online
after an outage since June.  If you want to see a bit of history, call
(312) 545-8086.  HST to 9600.  Operator Ward Christensen"
  (or something like that).
  Thanks!  AND, please call CBBS - lets see if a bit of history can still
live in this day and age.

R/DATA ON FM SUBCARRIER?,
Data was (is ?) available on some FM subcarriers.  About two years ago
financial market information was transmitted to handheld units.  The cost
of the service was in the 200 to 1000 dollar/month range.  I believe Lotus
even sold a "board" for the PC bus to receive the data and software to
get it into the spreadsheet.  Believe it even ran in background.
... about all I recall.

CBBS 15TH ANNIVERSARY,
  Mark your calendars - Saturday the 13th of Feb '93.  CBBS & Chinet
will have a pizza-fest, probably again at Barnaby's, Touhy and California,
2:00 PM.  BUT watch for a more "final" message, probably posted in mid-Jan
or perhaps late Jan.
  P.S. these have become "bring your toys" kind of get-togethers.  Last
year, we had a remote control blimp, a hover-craft, a laser, home-made
chain-mail (medieval armor), a great "suction cup dart gun" but made
from PVC that shot a toilet plunger, etc.  If you can't afford the pizza,
come anyway, someone will buy for you.

AUTHORS AND HISTORY,ASDF
  I was actually searching for the number of Chinet.  I was calling in
from another system that did not have my dialing directory.
  What have I been upto.  Unix lately.	Quite a bit of work out there
doing X-windows and client/server SQL.	Keeps me pretty busy.
  Calling in now and then?  I've pretty much been calling in since you
started the system 'lo these many years ago!
  If I remember, you`ve been using your PC for audio/midi.  I am going
to pick up an audio card for my PC this week.  I have been looking at
the Sound Blaster Pro, and another card from MediaVision.  Anybody have
any experience with either of these cards?
  Audio technology has reached an interesting point on PC's.  I was over
at a friends house this weekend and saw an INCREDIBLE demonstration of
sound in a Shareware program, Castle Wolfensteif 3/D.  Convinced me to
run out and get a board.
  Nice to hear from you Ward!

DISK CLEANUP,
Don't know if this is along the lines of what you're looking for, but
there's a program called PC-MANAGE (I believe it was put out by PC-Magazine
or such), that will PKZIP files that haven't been used after a specified
time automatically.  When a file is called that has been zipped, it will
be automatically uncompressed.	I haven't seen it around lately, but I do
have a copy of it somewhere and can dig it up if you're interested.
