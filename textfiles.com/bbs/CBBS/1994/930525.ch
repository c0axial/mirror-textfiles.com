 Funding? ha, only a phone line and a couple bucks worth of 'lectricity.
As long as Randy is willing, and doesn't move to the SouthWest like he
is threatening.

No, I wasn't smart enough to save the offending master boot record. In fact
I'm not sure how to do that. I modify AUTOEXEC.BAT to include
CHKDSK >CHKDSK.RPT AND MODIFIED a BASIC programs that copies stuff to a
RAM drive to scan the dataset looking for the 655360 figure, and stop the
world with a message when it failed to find it. This happened this morning,
giving us the best clues so far about when the virus was introduced. Since
the user had only one diskette in the machine yesterday, we have a good
suspect, but I am afraid to do anything with the diskette except run MSAV,
which did not find anything. After I sign off, I may call Central point or
someone. The technician at COMPAQ today was not helpful on this problem.

Meanwhile, if it happens again, I will not wipe out the evidence so soon.
