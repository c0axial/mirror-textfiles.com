RE/TALKING PRGM,NONO
  Thanks for the info. Sent it on to the inquirer via an
awful system called "unison" or "parti" or both.  I changed
the address to Bklyn NY to maintain parity with its zip code.
NYC postoffice is very rigid about borough separation.

RING NO ANSWER,
  Rats, sorry to hear that!  I'll have to ask randy to keep an eye on
CBBS, until such time as it can be made more solid - a rewrite for chinet,
perhaps?
  Also, I felt REALLY BAD about your forgetting the password on the
Ward Board - seems I was forgetting to check the log for a while, so it
seemed your pleas fell on deaf ears!  Again, my apologies!  It means a lot
to me to see you back here!  Also can't believe we had 4 new-user calls in
a row!	MD, Chi, Naperville, Park Ridge.  CBBS's number must be published
around a bit.  NOW, we need some good message threads!	(using the terms
loosely).

R/CD ROMS,
It so happens that I just read that Gateway 2000 is offering Sony CD ROMs
for $225. You and Ward helped me to decide to go that route. Thanks for the
help.

R/CD ROMS,
Do you have a Gateway?	I think their offer is only for their customers.

R/TELCO QUESTION,
  Yep, the telco sure can take away your ability to use touch tone.
  What happened, was that in the early days of touch tone, the switching
equipment wasn't very sophisticated, so they just slapped touch-tone
receivers on EVERY line.  NOW, your switching office proably has put in
newer highly-computerized switches, and it can do things like individually
reject touch tones - probably a bit in memory somewhere.  You'll have to
start paying...
  Gee, it just dawned on me - CBBS's line probably shouldn't be having
touch-tone on it!  It annoys me to have to pay $13/month for an "incoming"
line!  (Talking CBBS/The Ward Board - I dunno about CBBS/Chicago).

AS00,
I have a test coming up next Thursday on working on the AS/400.  Sure could
use some help.	Will check back 12/06 for clues! -Angela

R/FOR SALE,
  All I can think of the problem you had entering your message is that you
put one too many fields in the input line.  The syntax for expert users
is l;whoto;subject;password   but if you stuck in one too many "fields",
as I did in this by putting in "whatever", you are then putting the subject
into the password field.  You gave me the clue when you said "> 4 long"
because that's the length (4) of the password field:
>Function:?e;all;whatever;for sale
Msg 46026
++LINE >   4  LONG - truncated, return to ACCEPT, ^U to RE-ENTER:
FOR^U

REQUEST HELP - VISUAL 102,DESU
I am trying to get a VISUAL 102 TERMINAL to send data
out to an OKIDATA printer.  Does anybody know of:
where I can get hold of a VISUAL 102 Manual with port
specs, or does anybody locally still use Visual 102
( I already tried IIT ), or does anybody know if the
company still exists and where it is?
Any help will be aprreciated.
