I don't know what your autoexec looks like, but if you want smartdrive to
recognize the CD rom, you need to load the CD rom extention stuff BEFORE
you load smartdrive. Check which order they're in, in your autoexec.

Msg 46665 is 09 line(s) on 06/20/95 from DONNIE STUHLMAN
to ALL re: SOFTWARE CONTRACTS

Does anyone have (or know of a source) for a standard
software contract? I would like to know what is usual
and normal business activity for an agreement between a
vendor and end user.
Thanks for your help.
