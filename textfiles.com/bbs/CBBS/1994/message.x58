ANN PELZ,
  Ya, funky.  Ann Pelz is a 15 year old guy named Brandon Ellison.  I
don't think he catches on.  Promised not to use Ann's name again ;-)

CRC,
  There's also a "crcfast" that uses a pre-computed table to do the
CRC.  Also there's a CRC routine that uses it on the Ward Board (708)
849-1132, in one of the low #'d msgs, like msybe 7 or so?
  Basically a CRC is the remainder when a message, treated as a HUGE
number (128 byte msg = 128 x 8 bits = 1024 bit long NUMBER) divided by
a polynomial like x^16+x^15+x^2+1.  However, it can be computed by shifting
a bit at a time and doing XORs and other tricks; then others have figured
how to do it 8-bits at a time (instead of a loop shifting each bit in a
byte).	Actually I don't undersatnd it as well as it may already sound,
and cannot elaborate on what I've already said.

OVERNIGHT,
For what it's worth, a client of mine has been leaving one of their machines
on overnight for over 4 years now, and nothing bad has happened to it.	You
can mention that to your client (might want to tell him it would be a good
idea to turn off the monitor to prevent phosphor burn, both because it is
a good idea and because you're subtly pointing out that one of his concerns
was valid (and coming up with a workaround for it)).

R/80287 COPROCESSOR PROBLEMS,
  DIP = Dual Inline Package.  Means a typical "old" chip.  Newer chips
such as 386, 486, etc are something different - Pin Grid Array or something
like that.  DIP's "dual" means two rows of pins, "inline" means all the pins
are in a row (on each side) - I don't know, I recall there were packages
that had staggered rows of pins, perhaps that's why "inline" was part of
the name.  An 8087 is a DIP package - 40 pins or more.	SO my reference was
that if you have a pin grid array package, it would be harder to unplug
and reseat.
  How'd I know you wanted help on "LAST"?  In an effort to supply a more
usable system, I logged the missed help words.	This was very helpful in
the early days when I was building the help file.  It didn't do any good
to have someone asking for help on something logical to them but that
I hadn't thought of, so the idea struck me to go ahead and see what things
folks were asking for that wasn't there. ;-)

Deskjet font cartridges?  Deskjet Ink Cartridges?.  If the latter,
black?	Color?	If black, regular or long life?  Cost?
