to BRUCE KITCHELL re: R/XMODEM SOFTWARE FOR VAX

 Have you checked out a VMS users group? I'd think there would be one,
and if XMODEM is feasible on it, it should be in there - been around
long enough, heh!

I bit and bought some. There's nothing on them to indicate that they are
"different", but the charger has a light that goes on when you insert
a battery correctly and then goes off when the battery is charged. I
haven't reread the docs to see whether you can actually charge an odd
number of batteries, but it would seem so from observing operation (all
the NiCad chargers I've ever had required charging in pairs, a nuisance
if you have an appliance that uses an odd number of batteries). The pair
that I charged several weeks ago seems to be going strong, though I don't
use the Walkman radio I have very much.

to ALL re: RESISTOR=FUSE?

I'm reviewing "the Underground Guide to Laser Printers", a collection of
articles from Flash Magazine, whichis published by the folks out in West
Topsham, VT, who run BlackLightning, Inc., a toner cartridge rebuild/
refill operation. 'Tis rather interesting, but I came across an odd
(to me) statement:
 "The final part thatmay need to be replaced is the fuser
 lamp fuse. This is a 47, 1/4 watt resistor next to the
 power supply."
I have no technical expertise to evaluate this. Are resistors sometimes used
as fuses? I assume that anything that will "blow" under excess load
could be so used, so long as it blows before something critical. Can
someone enlighten me?

Msg 46569 is 04 line(s) on 01/28/94 from MICHAEL SHARTIAG
to BENJAMIN COHEN re: R/RECHARGABLE ALKALINES

Have you taken the charger apart yet? Is there any circuitry that look
s like some form of power pulsing as someone else has desbribed as an
old way of recharging alkalines? Do you have a scope you can put on the
outputs? Have you tried recharging plain 'old' duracells?

Msg 46570 is 07 line(s) on 01/28/94 from MICHAEL SHARTIAG
to BENJAMIN COHEN re: RESISTOR<>FUSE!

While you could consider any 'weak' link in a system a fuse, resistors are
not really a good choice. When they do, they tend to 'flame out'. A 1/4
watt resistor is not much more than a signal resistor. You can commonly find
them in things such as transisitr radios. They power needed to run a fuser
lamp would fry one immediately.
 It would seem that you have a typo in what you read, or they were
trying to specify a fuse type. Just a suggestion.

 Thanx for the info, but it is not what I asked for.

Msg 46572 is 07 line(s) on 01/29/94 from BENJAMIN COHEN
to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/RESISTOR<>FUSE!

They insist that it's not a typo and that it's a resistor used as
a fuse. The LaserJet III Companion has no reference to fuses in the
index. I don't have the manuals for my LJ1 and III here, they are at the
office. I suppose I should call HP's Tech Support and ask them what
fuse (if any) is used!

Thanks.

to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/RECHARGABLE ALKALINES

Let's see. There's one Phillips screw on the back. Prying with a screw-
driver (U.S. Robotics model, natch) reveals a very tight fit between the
base and outside sections. Aha! It's open. (If I can't get it back
together, you owe me one!) Big transformer in the center, no surprise.
There's a Motorola chip labelled XC78160J4/XXAB9336. A bunch of resistors.
[Not used as fuses, no doubt!] Four devices with a Motorola logo marked
2N/4401/337. These are black, flat on one side but otherwise cylindrical.
A fifth device of similar color and shape is labelled K982/3H and lacks
Motorola's "M". I have no scope and dunno much about the stuff. I haven't
yet tried recharging regular alkalines or NiCads, and am not sure that I
will (don't have any NiCads around - I long ago learned that I didn't
have appropriate uses for them, most of the things I wanted them for were
not used hard enough to make them worthwhile).
