Msg 46634 is 17 line(s) on 04/19/94 from PAUL STREETER
to ALL re: VIRUS

Has anyone heard of a virus that apparently gets into the master boot record
of the hard disk and then does little damage except make the computer act as
though the A: drive is seriously in need of replacement. Two machines in my
office have been infected by it, one of them twice. They are COMPAQ Prol's
 and it was COMPAQ customer support that suspected it was a virus and talked
me through the diagnosis and fix. The MICROSOFT antivirus did not find
anything. The diagnosis confirmation was to do CHKDSK and observe that the
line near the bottom that should say "655360 bytes total memory" instead
had a figure about 2K lower than that. The fix was to boot from a (write
protected) floppy and then run FDISK /MBR also from the floppy. /MBR means
write a new master boot record on the C: drive. This works, but COMPAQ does
not know the source of the virus and I have become curious, especially since
a few people in my office don't believe it is a virus.

Little damage is perhaps an under assessment of the results. The "bad" drive
messes up the FAT of any floppy it writes on. NORTON can fix it if you are
quick and lucky.
