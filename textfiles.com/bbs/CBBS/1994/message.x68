R/HELLO FROM RUSSIA,
Hi Ward! I use Internet from CompuServe once in awhile. The syntax
is: INTERNET:whatever-the-internet-address... and that's it. To
send a message from Internet back, the syntax will be the following:
????.???@CompuServe.com.   <<<< The ??? characters is the user ID
of the CompuServe user. Pretty simple, huh?

CHINET LOGIN,
I hope you've had better success at logging in to Randy's board.  Usually
7-1-E does the trick; terminal emulation doesn't matter unless you're
going for ANSI graphics output.  Once connected, changing parameters on your
end doesn't matter; you have to call in again with the new parms on your
terminal emulator.  Sometimes the lines are flakey
on chinet; I can't always get in either. Persevere.  I hope you take the
time and effort necessary to log in; I'd really enjoy exchanging EMAIL.
If you like, I can also give you an account on the Silicon Graphics system
at work. -not much there for PCs, but we do have a USENET connection as
well as being an INTERNET site.  Hope to see you at the bike trip in June.
John said he wasn't sure if you could make it or not -hope so. I plan on
it so far- if I make it, it'll be the first one in about three years.
It'll be good to see the gang again.

COMPUTERS AVAILABLE (MAYBE),
   As I was talking to the Schiller Park Library staff yesterday, it came
up that there are "several" computers (at this time, type unknown) in their
basement, gathering dust, because no one knows how to use them.  The staff
was VERY receptive to donating them to a worthy cause, and I've seen all
too many messages in the past year asking for used computer donations to help
the handicapped, etc.  Just in case I see anything worth salvaging when I
hit their basement today, does anyone know of any WORTHY causes (they have
to be worthier than "The Cliff Sharp Computer Foundation") that could use a
computer or two, in working condx, no matter how obsolete?

16550AFN UART,
What is the difference between 16550 and the 16550AFN UART chip an
and how will affect me if I own 386-33 or 25mhz. I'm considering buying
V.32 BIS/HST modem perferably an external.

R/KEYBOARDS AGAIN,
  Thanks!  I tried the Northgate back when I first bought my AST premium
in '87, but they had the enlarged enter key and "lost" \ key.
  I must presume they have changed a lot since then!  Do you know if any
have the ctrl-caps switch on TOP so a machine with multiple users can
have each switch it to their preference?
  Thanks.

That's probably Jean Barber.  She has logged on here a couple of times
in the past year.

DISK CLEANUP TIP,
  Heh.
  I needed to clean up my system disk.	I had about 350 programs in it,
i.e. little (and some not so little) utilities, bat files, etc.
  I was trying to figure how to clean it up without removing something
important or having to stare at each name...
  I finally decided to create an ..\unused subdir under the directory
(called \sys\bin), and move all my files to it, then move back the
ones I KNOW I use a lot.
  The first day, I kept getting errors as things I use weren't there -
so I popped into TREEVIEW to move what was missing back.
  The next day only a few showed up - fewer and fewer each day.
  So now, I've got about 75 files in my directory, and 275 in the
..\unused directory!
  Seems to be working out just fine!
