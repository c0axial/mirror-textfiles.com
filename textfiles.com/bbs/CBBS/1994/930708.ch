Hmm, what are "Atrophied Algorithms"? Oops, you said "Algorythms".
Music related?

to RICHARD TUPPER re: R/WINDOWS "TERMINAL"

Boy, I'm looking at the manual, and I sure don't see any indications
that Windows "Terminal" can RECEIVE a call. It has a box setting for
"Originate", and so on. The ONLY vague ref is that it says it could
talk to a computer in the same room via "null modem cable", but - well,
I haven't read the entire text - but it doesn't APPEAR to talk about that
any further.

smartdrive for 5.0 does not recognize CDrom for caching.
only the 6+ versions of DOS will do that.

I'm going to ONE BBS this year. I will be running the ASP booth at the
show. I was amazed that round trip air fare was only $170. The stupid hotel
costs $95 a night though.

Atrophied Algorythms is a firm which I created a few years ago to do
software titles under. The original plan was to have some partners
working with me, but they all dropped out before ever becoming fully
involved. Still, I've managed to put a few titles out there, with back-
burner plans to do a bunch more.

This is the way Turbo Power Software got started, if you recall. They
published some excellent stuff to the PD that everybody picked up.
After the name got around some they started publishing commercial software
(primarily to the development market) and their success rose from that
point. Nice to see somebody make it once in a while.

The music publishing firm I have (another one-man operation) is THD
Tunes, formerly THD Tunes, Ltd. All of this stuff falls under the umbrella
of Parsec Systems, which I founded with a partner in 1978. I bought
out my buddy and own the whole money-losing mess myself now.
