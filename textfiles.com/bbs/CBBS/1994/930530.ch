]Hi, Just cruising cyberspace. I see that this is supposed to be for
techies, so I imagine I won't be using up your bandwidth
too often, but it was nice knowing you're there. (I was a
little disoriented until I realized I had to use PC ANSI settings.(As
you may have  guessed, I have a Mac). Anyway, Goodnite

to WARD re: VIRUS AGAIN

I have the infected diskette in my posession. Central Point doesn't seem
to be interested. The tech support person only suggested that I get the
latest set of signatures from a bulletin board. Oh well.

However the look on the user's face when he told me he had received the
message from my detection program made it worth it.

to ALL re: VOICE ON THE INTERNET

The following file, listed recently on a local BBS, appears intriquing:
 IVC10.ZIP + 326k 0 5-24-94 Internet Voice Chat - Chat
 voice on IRC
Has anyone here used IVC10.ZIP to turn Internet Relay Chat (IRC) into
a telephone? (Just about a year ago, some of us CBBS'ers here
wondered about the feasibility of doing such a thing on the Internet.)
