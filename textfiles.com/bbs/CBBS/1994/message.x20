DEBUG,
Does anybody know what the command set for DEBUG is for MS-DOS? If
your going to ask what version of MS-DOS, I'll say 3.21.

COPH,NONO
The following is part of a note I have received from a friend in
New York.  I recall that you wrote just such a program for Hadley
School, must be at least 7 or 8 years ago.
  ] A friend, Marie Kessel, has developed a problem with vision.  She
  ] wants to make her computer talk to her.  Can anyone suggest good
  ] software?
  ] Marie runs halfway houses; one of the problems that comes up is
  ] dyslexia.  She feels that a talking computer could be useful there
  ] also.

  ] Her home computer is Macintosh, but the halfway houses are using
  ] IBM machines.  Software for either platform would be interesting.

BTW, I have lost track of COPH bbs since its move to the southwest side.
Is it still in operation?

R/OS2 BETA TESTERS,
  Mike Warot just got one, and he calls here occasionally (mebbe better
to drop him a line on the Ward Board).	I have attempted to download it
at work, trying to make a "copying machine" - but it filled the hard disk,
darn it!  The distribution diskettes are already compressed (like, but
perhaps not exactly, as if they contained only ZIP files), so they don't
compress.
  I have the C-set/2 and plan to work on that; I'm not interested in the
idea of a total reformat of my disk for the new version - wondering how
I'd integrate my current OS/2 functions, restore the desktop, etc.
  I DO wish they'd say just what it conflicts with - I was told that
you couldn't install previous beta tests over old OS/2, but did so AFTER
zapping all files and cleaning up all the extended attribute pointers
with Norton Utilities (wrote my own DOS program to SHOW which files have
extended attr pointers).

4079 PRINTER,
Do you have any info as to when the 4079 color printer will be
available or any paper info on same?

R/CACHE..,
  OK, got to figure some way to get folks aware of it - I think I'll find
a listing - lets see, should be '77 to be 15 years ago - or mebbe just about
anyone who wants to come, from then or more recent.
  As to your questions about line noise, no, sorry, I'm not in that area,
I'm 30 miles south of CBBS.
  What I did one day when I had that problem, was to talk to Randy Suess,
and we got the little clicks on our voice line, so I just left the phone
off the hook while going to another phone line to call the phone company.
  Actually, I'd arranged it in advance - i.e. said I had a problem, they
said to call back if I ever isolated it.  Well, I did, and they took a
while, but traced it down to a faulty multiplexor and took it out of
service pending repair.
  Dunno if Randy's gotten this modem changed over, but it seems it wasn't
going MNP.  And tonight when I called at 2400, I got garbage then a
disconnect, then noticed it said "connect 1200".  Hmmm. I KNOW I set the
speed to 2400 when I do the ATA.  Anyway, I switched to 1200, called back,
and got in.
  Hopefully I'll have time to get the HST repaired, then we can go MNP again.

MODEM SIGNALS,
Actually, CTS has become more important than ever, since it's how a modem
tells the computer "hold on and let me catch my breath" when you're running
the computer-to-modem link faster than the modem-to-modem link.  I've never
met a modem that didn't use DSR, though I've also never met one that used it
for anything other than to inform the computer that the modem was powered up.
It's possible that some DIP-switch or NVRAM setting was causing the modem
not to generate those signals (I've explained to people more times than I
care to remember why it's necessary to configure a modem to have DCD follow
the state of the connection, rather than stay on all the time, in order to
use most terminal programs' dialing directories).

R/HEARD OF ASC SYSTEMS,
I haven't heard of that particular company, but it sounds like you may have
a multi-line voice response unit.  There were a lot of companies that
developed that type of technology in the 80's and a good majority of them
are no longer in business.  Tahe a look at the boards with the RJ11
connectors and see if there is a vendor name, ie.. Dialogic, Periphonics,
If your really intrested in finding out who made the system, find a library
that carries: Speech Technology, Inbound/Outbound (now called Call Center
Manager). These magazines normally list MFGs who mave voice type cards
for PCs and other products. Suggest you go back 3-5 yrs and start from
there. Good Luck....

R/DISK CLEANUP,
I found the file for PCMANAGE.	As for the TSR overhead, I don't know
what it is specifically, but the program that is loaded as a TSR is about
28k.  The way the program keeps track of the last access date of the files
is by creating a file in each directory called INDEX.CMP.  The program
can handle 100 directories/files per directory/and child directories,
and allows you to specify any files (up to 100) that you don't want to
be touched by the program (config.sys, command.com, etc).  It also
notes that you shouldn't compress any OS/2 files (system ones, I believe).
The archive is fairly small, about 36k zipped.	I'll upload it to your
directory on Chinet.
