R/OS/2 ON D:,
  The good news is: you can have OS/2 even BOOT from D:
  The bad news is that you can only do so if you go under BOOT MANAGER,
which requires you to completely re-partition your hard disk - the boot
manager becomes a small partition, then you could have C: and D:, etc.

RING/PWORD,NONO
Nah, no problem.  I let Randy know right away when it happened and
he fixed it.  Hasn't occurred again since.  As for p-word, I should
have recalled it since it is based on something important to me.
I think chaz has not been calling here recently, and I know he
no longer calls chinet.  I know where he hangs out and will let him
know thru email that we are back up.  Message threads?	Betcha they
will be developed by the callers "as the spirit moves them." Fer sure.

GOOD TO SEE YOU BACK!,
It's good to see CBBS back up.	I've been following it's progress on Chinet
and was afraid that it wasn't going to be resurrected any time soon.
Welcome back!

IDIOSYNCRASY IN TANDON DOS?,
If anyone has a recent Tandon PC running DOS 5.0, I would appreciate
you're running the two test programs given below.  The purpose is to
determine what value is in the CX register at the start of a .COM
program.  (No, it's not the program length; that's true only if you
load the .COM file under DEBUG.  The normal value actually is 00FF.
I need to know if the Tandon has 0000 instead.)
  Test program one:	Test program two:
  org 100h
  mov dl,ch		Same as test program one,
  add dl,40		except change second line
  mov ah,2		to read "mov dl,cl"
  int 21h
  mov ah,4ch
  int 21h
Each program will print one character on the console.  Please
report what each of those characters are.  Thanks much.

R/CHANGING AT&T PC63000 BATTER,
I think the battery is located in a holder on the bottom of
the machine.  I had to chnage one years ago...the motherboard
is upside down, and you remove the BOTTOM cover of the case to get
to it (I think!).

HP LASERJET4 & TRUETYPE,
I have been looking at the LJ4 and have called HP in an attempt to get a
handle on the truetype world.  First as I see it, truetype basically pr
provides a subset of the functionality of postscript, being scalable fonts
only.  No graphic processing is set it in.
  I asked HP if additional truetype fonts could be downloaded into the
printer.  Their response was 'no', that truetype was not downloadable, and
that I could either add cartridges with the fonts, or use something like
ATM to convert from truetype to bit mapped graphic data and print that.
Can someone seperate fact from fiction here ????

R?DJ500 PROBLEM (!),
The cable is an off-the-shelf one I got from Elektek at the same time
I bought my DJ500 there.  Because I was able print so many pages before
the problem sprung up, I thought maybe static was the problem.	All
those pages rubbing on the platten, maybe.  (The cable mentioned above
is a six-foot parallel.)  Since the DJ works fine with the serial
port, I'm not sure I want to risk having anyone monkey with it even
though it's under warranty.  ("If you're not sure it's broke, you're
not sure you should fix it," as they say.)

VISUAL TECH INC?,
Does anybody know the location of Visual Technology Inc.
There were located in Andover, MA at one time.	They
made the Visual 102. Or maybe they have gone out of business?

RE: MODEM PROBLEM,
Is the modem "really" playing dead? or is Procomm not sending data
because it thinks that the modem is not "ready" ? Try changing the
modems setup for line control (eg. AT&C1 )
