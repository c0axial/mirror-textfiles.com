]Tony: It was nice to be able not only to put a face to your name but
to get a pic.  I have enough trouble remembering faces.  So seldom
do I go to any of these things that I even have to look twice to
identify people I know well.  Randy dumped his camera on me -- preset
for automatic -- and said "it's on auto, just focus and shoot."  Sure.
So dark in there couldn't see well enough to focus well. Heh. Also
I much prefer to work with B/W, I don't like to work with color.
