 Randy Suess (CBBS Co-inventor) gets his NEWS feed from a satellite,
is that what you were looking for? Chinet's guest line is 312-283-0559,
if I remember right.
 I THINK there was some talk about getting encrypted mail via satellite -
you'd be sent the decryption key for your system, but not sure if that
happened or not (I mean, Randy doesn't do it, but it might have happened).

 Upgrading to a 386-SX would be the most practical - but it will depends
upon what you have and what you want. The case is a small form-factor,
and doesn't have an upgradeable motherboard. Also the video is just
VGA - and if you are say at CGA or "nothing" now, that's a step up, but
it isn't super-VGA (800 x 600 resolution) nor is the monitor.
 You might be better off looking at a new 386SX.
