Msg 46553 is 05 line(s) on 01/08/94 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to MELVIN LEWIS re: R/XMODEM DOCUMENTATION

 No, sorry, Glenn, '89 is way past anything I documented. SO I have
no idea of "latest" or who would approve changes, etc.
 Saw your msg about switching between 7E1 and 8N1, sorry, no idea there
either - I've always used a comm program that just ignores parity and runs
at 8N1, and never had a system I couldn't connect to, so I never switch.

Msg 46554 is 04 line(s) on 01/09/94 from JOE SEROCKI
to ALL re: NEW LANDLINE BBS IN NW BURBS

There is a new landline bbs, dedicated to survival/personal security/
emergency services topics, in NE Illinois. No fees, no file ratios for
emergency services personnel (upon request to the sysop). Call
708-587-2398, 14.4kb, 24 hours. Pretty busy, so keep trying

Msg 46555 is 06 line(s) on 01/09/94 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to WARD re: PARTY

If I were in Chicago, I'd be there. Alas, I am in NY. SIGH. Anyway,
I was on the system LONG before '89; certainly by '85. I was just
curious as to when I first got in (it was with a version of MDM7xxx
set up for a Kaypro, and the person who gave me the program, which I used
at first with a little Radio Shack 300 bps modem, thoughtfully left
CBBS-1 in the dialing directory.
