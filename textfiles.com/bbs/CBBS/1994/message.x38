MARS-BBS Z-120,
A friend of mine appears to have taken on a task bigger than he can
chew. He is helping another friend take a Zenith Z-120 and trying to
use it as a BBS on packet radio for a MARS station. It appears this
Zenith won't run PCDOS and nothing is available for BBS work in
ZDOS. So CP/M seems to be the only hope right now. Zenith mentions
CP/M v2.2.101 for running CP/M. Anybody out there that can help,
please EMAIL me some information to pass on to him. And thanks!

CBBS,
  Yes, it is nice to be back - and to have you back!  Contribute?  Ya!
What we need is some "message topics" to bring on the threads (to use
the term loosely - CBBS doesn't currently support "threads" i.e. keeping
track of replies - but you can use summary commands to read all msgs of
a given topic).
  I think I'll start with the next msg - about CD ROMS.

INTERNET VIA PUBNET?,
Does Chicago have any "Pubnets" for accessing the Internet?
    An article in ONLINE ACCESS, in the Fall 1992 issue, gives three access
routes to Internet:  Local universities, commericial BBS's, and Pubnets:
    "The third, and often the cheapest route, is through public access
networks, often referred to as Pubnets.  There are hundreds of Pubnets
spread throughout the world.  A Pubnet can best be described as a
noncomercial BBS specializing in providing Internet access.  Charges are
nominal; in fact, in many cases, access is free.  Pubnets grew out of
the ideal that internet access should be available to all...."
    "To find out more about Pubnets, and to find your nearest site,
subscribe to the Pubnet mailing list by sending an e-mail message to:
	       pubnet-request@chinacat.unicom.com

R/AT HOME LAPTOP UPDATES,
Have you considered disk compression software?	If you can put a 40
Meg disk in there, then you could use SuperStore (sp?) or something
like that to gain a lot more space (of course, 20 will get you 40,
too...).  If things go right, you'd be able to load the software
above 640, and you'd be set.  Note that, since most processors run
PDQ, there's really no operations penalty -- it's faster to decompress
stuff than it is to load it off the disk!  I've been using DRDOS
(with built-in SUPERSTOR) for most of the past year, and I've had
no apparent slowdown...

R/HP LASERJET4 & TRUETYPE,
  I'm not that up on True Type, but ATM is not a "font" when it gets to the
printer, just a bit-stream.  The fonts are scaled, filled in, and rastorized
to the printer.  Thus I think Tru-Type would be the same - which if true
would result in the answer you got - that "no, trutype is not downloadable".

R/VISUAL TECH INC?,
  I've got a HUGE list of a BUNCH of companies - not maybe like the
CD-ROM one, but all I've got is Visual Business Systems,(404) 956-0325,Voice
and - heh heh - THEY might have heard of the OTHER "visual", but probably not.
