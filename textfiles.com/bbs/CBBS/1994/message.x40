3.5 TO 51/4 CONVERT???,GLOB
Is there a way to use copyiipc to backup a 3 1/2" disk onto a 5 1/4" disk?
I've had no success after 6 hours of popping disks.  The 3 1/2 inch drive
is formatted at 1.44 mb, even though the disk itself is only 720...
the 5 1/4 disk drive is formatted at 1.2.  Any ideas?

R/3.5 TO 51/4 CONVERT???,
Why use copyiipc? Just use the BACKUP command from DOS if all you want
to do is really backup the files? Or better yet, just ZIP them into
one neat little file and then save the new file to disk. If you really
want to make a running copy of some protected software... then good
luck!

CD-ROMS,
  Any thoughts about CD-ROMS?  I see many bundled with their own controllers -
are many of them SCSI?	I have an IN-2000 SCSI controller, but might like
to go for a faster one and one supported by OS/2 such as an Adaptec -
lets see (scratching head)... 1542B?  Then the ROM itself: OS/2 only
supports IBM and Toshiba, though "some" others work by patching the name
of the drive mfgr into the support module.
  I'd like music, and I'd like NOT to buy in on the "trailing edge" of
an era - sounds like the double-speed, or even quad-speed CDs are right
here now, though not completely taking over the market.
  Lets put OS/2 out of the picture for now - Just windows (currently 3.0,
but with 3.1 on the shelf).  What drive would work on my IN-2000?
  Thanks!
  P.S. lets get some messages going here!  I sure would appreciate it!
I know with all the outages, CBBS will never see 50 calls a day again on
its one line, but perhaps we can get a bit of "critical mass" to keep it
alive as a piece of working history!  Thanks!

R/CD-ROMS,
I just wrote an article about multimedia-related hardware, including
CD-ROM drives. This was for a shareware mag, so I didn't look at the
high end. OTOH, I disregarded the true low end too. I focused upon
those that were fully compatible with Win 3.0 with MM extensions and
3.1. The hands-down winner was Sony's CDU535. (Among the best sources
I found was FastMICRO. About #350 to the door, very fast service,
a sales staff which knew what it was doing, etc.

BTW, I too am very glad you're back up, not only because this  has
been my favorite BBS since my first modem in the early '80s (well,
except for my own BBS, of course <G>) but also because I slipped
this phone number into an article about shareware's first decade.
(Remember that we spoke briefly about that a couple of months ago?)
That article is turning into my most-sold piece ever--in the U.S.,
U.K., Australia and Canada. (The latter is a mainstream pub, but
they still were interested.) Also, some writer in Texas wants to
excerpt the section about CBBS and MODEM/XMODEM this week....So you
may get a healthy number of additional callers as a result.

Regards.

R/ZIP FILES ON MAC?,
I asked a Mac guru at work and he said there is a commercial program
called Stuff It Deluxe that is available. He also said that there were
a number of shareware programs one of which is called DEZIP.

CARDINAL CLONE - DRDOS VS. DOS,NONE
Scenario...  Clone machine (Happens to be a Cardinal) XT processor
with DRDOS installed on hard drive.
Question... Can I pop a DOS 3.3 diskette in and just format and sys
the hard drive, or is there more to do?
45941,07,12/09/92,WARD CHRISTENSEN,DENNIS STAHL
R/CARDINAL CLONE - DRDOS VS. D,
  The more usual way would be to check out FDISK first - that way you
know if the drive is DOS compatible.  You could remove the partition,
add it back, format it /S and go.
  P.S. you said "format & sys", I presume you know that format /s does
that.  What I'm not clear on is under what condx COMMAND.COM gets copied
over.  One does, one doesn't - i.e. like sys c: doesn't, but format c: /s
does.

RE: MODEM PROBLEM,
The modem initialization string is !ATZ &C1 &D2 S0=0 S7=8!
Makes no difference if I use &D0 or &D2, or leave off the initial "!".
A friend (whose modem this is) says she has the same problem dialing
out with a non-Procomm program; likewise, if she exits from the
program and then reinvokes it, she has greater success in getting
connected.  (Her program is a dedicated application, and gives only sparse
clues as to what's happening with the line or modem).
