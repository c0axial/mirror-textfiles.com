]Thanks for helping, Alex!  I am in the worst state of depression I've been
in in 20 years, and CBBS being down was yet another - uh - well, it is
like being trapped under a heavy door in a earthquake - so cbbs being down
was like another few bricks on top of the door... I can only ask, like the
song, "Why do fools fall in love".  I sure shouldn't have, makes me only
too aware of my many hangups, inexperiences, phobias, all the skeletons
that grow up in a 48-year-old loner's closets.  Sigh.

]Hello, the names Joel Dare..  I run a BBS running RENEGADE
software in Roy, Utah.  I have a 14.4k baud modem that is up and running.
The # is (801) 774-8423.  I found your number in a magazine from 1992,
and called to see if the board was still up..  Amazing, up since 1977.
This is great.  I'm a DOOR author, and would like to know more about
our system, and what type of Operating System your using etc.  I'm
calling long dist, so I'll make it short.  I'd appreciate a letter
from you or something.  If I could get an address that would be great.
I'll leave mine in case I don't ever call back.

Put my zipcode on the wrong line.. Oh, and it is 84067-1058
.
Hope to hear from you..  I would like to start a HUGE BBS list, I have
the list, and now would like to put it on a few boards.  The list can
be netted via a download of the file, and a compare program I wrote
to acompany it.  SeveN Software is the title of my software, and SeveN
BBS List is the name of the door.  SeeYa, gotta run.  11:24pm 02-17-94
