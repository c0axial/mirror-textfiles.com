to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/16 YEARS!

Uh, I have some old logs - I can scan thru 'em, but I think I have the old
ones offline - perhaps on unreadable 800K media, heh - back when you could
buy a double-step (80-track) 5.25" low density drive, and pack 10 sectors
per track, getting 800K out of it - so I'd have to check how far back I
go.
 I did find a couple logins from Jan '89 including your trying to help
someone with a TRS 4P hoping to get some DOS stuff going, you told 'em to
find a new home for it and buy another machine. heh.
 Thanks for the congrats - hope you can make the party.

to ALL re: RECHARGABLE ALKALINES

From the little I have read about them, they are new, specially designed
or formulated battries. You have to get the batteries and the special
recharger. While only assuming, if it were a special circuit in the
charger alone, they would market it to the world for use with standard
alkaline battries.

I have 2 Motorola Ultra Classic Alpha's for sale.
These are the thin tall portable with 100 memory locations,
and each supports alphanumeric entries.
These would be a good deal for anyone just wanting to keep their number
and swapping into a portable - as the carriers usually rebate the dealers
for all NEW number activations with $200-$250 to offset the cost of a NEW
phone for a NEW customer. Existing customers wanting to change have to
bite the bullet.
I also have an older thicker Motorola portable 8000 that is numeric only,
and has 16 memory locations.
all are working and in service as I type.

to WARD re: DIGITAL MODEMS

is you think X.25 is a little scary. try 'digital modems'
this is the technology used by some credit card verification systems that
have the card swipe read and transmitted via originating modem to a 'digital'
device the looks at the T-1 bit stream (on one of the 24 or more channels)
and decodes the bit stream directly into data without converting to analog
and then passing the analog stream into a modem.
Another Digital Signal Processing technique is used to combine FAX data -
which of course is just V.29 9600 bps data streams into a mux for remote
office connections. Instead of chewing up 64kbs of a analog voice channel,
the mux merely carves out 9600 for the real fax data, and another 32kbs for
the compressed voice (or 16kbs, or even 8kbps) and leave the rest for any
kind of data. so on a single 56k line, you get FAX, voice line, and data
. neat huh ??

Msg 46551 is 18 line(s) on 01/07/94 from MELVIN LEWIS
to ALL re: WINDOWS & OS/2 COMMUNICATIONS

I am currently writing a Windows 3.0/3.1 communications program which was
initially to be used on my job (microwave radio tech) to communicate with
our HP1000 CP/M (LARSCAN 1000) alarm system. After successfuly completing
this portion of the program I decided to implement file xfer capabilities
in the program so that I could use it for all of my communications needs.
I have since been able to include XMODEM(Checksum)/(CRC) with excellent
results. I would be interested in any specific C or assembly examples of
ANY and ALL other transfer protocols. I may be reached via Compuserve Mail
through my user ID 72700,3275.
Also, I would be interested in any information or examples of Windows code
implementing serial or parallel communications. I have the terminal example
written by Brian Woodruff of Microsoft, but this example does not include
any mention of file xfer protocols or switching between 7E1-8N1-7E1.The
particular problem that I am having in this respect is that after the file
is transferred successfuly and I switch back to 7E1 I can transmit from my
keyboard to the remote system but I can't recieve from the remote system.
I would appreciate any input from anyone on this problem or the above mentined
protocol examples. Thanks, M. Glenn Lewis, Las Vegas, NV

to SYSOP re: XMODEM DOCUMENTATION

I have an old copy of XYMODEM.DOC which I recieved from Compuserve and I was
able to implement the protocol in a Windows comm program (see message to ALL)
but I wanted to find out if there have been any "official" enhancements or
additions to this document since 1989. If so I may be reached via Compuserve
USER ID 72700,3275 if you have the time or maybe you could leave me a note
on this system directing me to the source of such information. I don't want
to take up any more of your time than neccessary so I'll cut it short with
a Thank You, M. Glenn Lewis, Automated Microwave West, Las Vegas, NV. Bye.
