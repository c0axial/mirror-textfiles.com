R/IDE INFO,
Hi Ward! Well hopefully I am suppose to use MS-DOS' format command. As
I just received my IDE-HD back from the shop. They replace it with one
that has PROTOTYPE stamped on it (oh boy?!?). Anyway, I couldn't get
it to do anything when I got it. As I could log on the hard drive, but
couldn't access, copy, read, or anything with it. Even when I tried to
partition the drive, the computer locked up! So I used MS-DOS' format
and everything started working. Format reported 65536 bytes bad for
every partition I made and I assume that's IDE protecting those
sectors, because other programs like CHKDSK and Norton's DISK TEST
reports no bad sectors. Though one partition was different as format
reported it had 83968 bytes in bad sectors. CHKDSK says it only has
18432 bytes in bad sectors (Norton also reported bad sectors in that
partition as well). If you subtract 83968 from 18432 you get 65536.
Isn't that interesting? May I assume that my IDE drive is saving 65536
bytes from DOS for bad sectors for each partition, though one spot on
my drive has 83968 in bad sectors and 65536 bytes are hidden and 18432
bytes exposed to DOS?

R/80287 COPROCESSOR PROBLEMS,
I tried re-seating the chip. No good. Error message persists.
I think it's a incompatibility problem. There is no place in my BIOS
setup to tell the system where the coprocessor is. According to what
I've read, the system SHOULD automatically detect the chip. Yet,
obviously, it is trying to use a part of memory already allocated to
another device. I seem to have a non-standard BIOS that doesn't have the
ability to allocate the same place in memory for devices as other systems do
and this causes me a lot of problems. I think I may eventually have to
replace my Quadel 1989 BIOS. <sigh> In the meantime, I will remove that
coprocessor and return it to the buyer. Thanks for your help.

By the way, what is a DIP chip? I didn't understand that reference. Thanx.

R/HELP,
 I'd like to ask a question. How did you know I tried to ask for Help on
 "last"?  I was just wondering. Anyway, I forgot how to find out where
I left off in reading messages and the number of the last message I read.
Thanks for reminding me.

KEBOARDS,
Ward -- did you ever get an ideal keyboard?  I saw another Northgate
ad and it reminded me.	BTW, their keyboards were used almost
exclusively in the film SNEAKERS; possibly because they have the right
sound.	They didn't get any credits!
