R/3.5 TO 51/4 CONVERT???,
  I think you can XCOPY with the /s option to include subdirectories -
to copy between different sized media.	Then, if you need a volume label,
you can use the DOS Label command to put in the label.
  If the diskettes are copy protected, you're probably out of luck.

R/4 MEG DRAM'S?,
I have not seen dip memory in the 4 meg chip, but they are readily available
as 4 meg simm memory modules.

R/TELEBIT QBLAZER MODEM,
Ward:

     Thanx for the info.  Decided not to get the QBlazer.  I took US
Robotics on their offer of a trade in on a new DS 16.8K.  The cost
was a few $$ more and I gained a great deal of compatability.

KEYBOARDS,
Anyone know a PC keyboard that is 100% compatible with IBM's enhanced
layout (I don't want \ key in funny place - I want it below [ <- ]) and
I want a "small" enter key (for if I have a large enter key, then \ gets
put somewhere "funky").
  ===> AND... that has a switch for swapping control and caps?
  ..and that does NOT do ANYTHING funky like add a left column of PC-style
function keys?	I'm tired of inconsistency in how programs handle ctrl-caps
swapping, particularly under OS/2.

R/CARDINAL CLONE - DRDOS VS. D,
Hmm... I didn't think of FDISK.  Thanks!

R/CARDINAL CLONE - DRDOS VS. D,
Why do you want to get rid of DRDOS?  It'll run everything you can
run under MS-DOS, and has a number of benefits.  As far as I can
tell, you'd only be LOSING functionality by going to MSDOS 3.xx.
Of course, I'm assuming that you're talking DRDOS 6.0, which has
all that MS-DOS 5.0 has and then some.	DRDOS 5.0 was supposedly
the motivating force behind MSDOS 5;

But if you DO want to replace it, I'm pretty certain that you can
boot up from an MS-DOS (3.31+) floppy and just FORMAT C:/S to
start things anew.
