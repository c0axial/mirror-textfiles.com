COMPUADD EXPRESS,
Pardon the noise, but it's abad line from Schenectady...

Ward, I'm in love with my CompuAdd
Express machine!
Not only is the machine GREAT, but their SERVICE is good, too.
When the machine first arrived, it hgad some monitor
problems (image tilted slightly).  I called them, and the next day
a new monitor (better quality) arrived from Texas, with
prepaid airfare for its sibling to go
back to texas.	WOW.  A week later I gave up on trying to
fix a problem with clock
drift.	I called -- and once again, they sent me out an
upgraded machine (2 extra MB of RAM).  Thewy're fast,
DR DOS is SUPERIOR to MSDOS (hey, I used to use CP/M -- I'm
surprised, too!), and the machine (now that teething is over) is very nice.

The Canon double drive is also neat -- works just fine, and saves
a drive bay for other goodies.

I did get to do a little hardware hack (external).  My office
hooks up to a VAX cluster through a Develcon Dataswitch.  Now, the DSW
only looks at the following RS-232 lines -- TD, RD, Sig Grnd, and DTR.
DR DOS has a built-in task switcher (speedy with all that RAM!), but it
forces DTR low when you switch away from a COM task.  That meant that the
Dataswitch was hanging up on me, so backgrounding wasn't too useful.  My
fix was to disconnect DTR from the computer, and wire the Dataswitch end
of DTR to a small Radio Schok power supply (nominal;
6 VDC).  Now I have an eternal DTR ready!  I LIKE THAT MACHINE (too
bad all I have at home is an original XT!).

R/WARD,
  What Again?  (just kidding).	Is it as goofy as last time?  Or is this
the one with Dvorak handing me the award while I look off in space?  (There
was camera trouble, I wasn't ready...)

R/KEYBOARDS AGAIN,
I just got a new Northgate 102, and the dip switches are all in a little
opening that's on top of the keyboard.	There's also a little orange
key that lets you make some changes on the fly.  I'm not sure whether
it lets you change CTRL-CAPs Lock on the fly without looking atthe
manual.  (Sorry, but I like the large Enter key -- I use SmartKey to
move /\ to locations that I want (in place of '", but then I use
Dvorak layout, which changes lots of things!)

FAX,
Just got Faxability With OCR. Send/Recv'd a few FAXes with a friend of mine
today to test the OCR. We tried pages with several different fonts and size
sizes. It did pretty well, much better than I thought it would. With a
fixed pitch font (about 12pt) it only had 2 or 3 errors on the page.
The software can put a "~" char before every char it is not sure of. And
it did put a "~" before every char it got "wrong", but also a few that
were correct.
The software can save the OCR output into about 30-40 different formats
which is nice. I saved it into Word for Windows format, doctored it up,
and retransmitted it all in under 5 minutes. The OCR is pretty slow, with
it taking 45-90 seconds per page (lots faster then I can re-type! ); )
It works with many different FAX boards, not just Intel's (but I do have
the Intel).

R/DISK CLEANUP TIP,
I meant, "what if you have two files of the same name and you
move them (sequentially) to your \sys\bin\unused?  For example, what if y
had, in different directories, d.com (a GIF file viewer) and d.com
(a replacement for DIR)?"  The problem would occur in moving files
to your 'unused' directory, since the second would overwrite the
first, etc.

Of course, you may not have this problem!  I load many executables
via ALIASES, and the aiases sometimes have names different from the
commands themselves.  In some cases, the directories don't have
to be on the path (e.g., for graphics stuff), so I may end up
with multiple executable files that share a name.

In any event, MERRY CHRISTMAS, Ward!
