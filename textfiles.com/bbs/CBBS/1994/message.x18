QDOS & XTREE,
Does anybody use utilities like QDOS v2.0 and Xtree v2.0 anymore, or
am I not moving with the times fast enough and they have better
directory and subdirectory utilities out there? What are the latest
versions of QDOS and Xtree anyway?

R/OS2 UTILITIES,
continued to look into the issue of defrag.
of the disk. In my case, our applications were written in FAT
file format. We've talked to Norton twice this week and it
looks like we can use Norton 6.0 as long as we boot DOS, run
Norton use the utili and then boot to OS2.
If this works.... this will solve my biggest problem disk
defragmentation... As for other Norton utilities, I don't
k on OS2.k on
If I can get a spare system, or clean up the hard disk, I
will try to add DOS in PM and see if I can go from OS2 to DOS
and run norton. The problem I have had in the past is our
application requires that we have DOSSWAP OFF. Looks as if
I'll have to play for a while and see what we can get to
work or not work....

R/32-BIT DEVELOPMENT,
Ward, Ill let you know when I get my
Workset/2. I guess now that you've got me curious, I'll have to
weigh it when it gets here...and I thought MSC++7.0 & the SDK was a lot
of docs. (I'm working my way back up to long message lines (:-}...) Bye

THANKS,
Thanks for resuscitating the world's first!

R/PRINTER SHARING,
  Randy Suess recommends the Buffalo printer-sharing box.  He uses one at
home to share a laserjet between several machines - even though he also has
a Novell Netware LAN.  I believe the thing could handle a combo of serial
and parallel, with - I think - each port being either in or out - rather
flexible.  I don't think it cost all that much.  You MIGHT have to switch
to serial with its better distance capability.	I found by putting a "Y"
cable on my printer port, one going to lap-link to my lap-top, the other
to a switch box and on to the printer, so the printer is "cut out" of the
picture when I lap-link, well, it doesn't work,  I have to UNPLUG the
cable to the printer (even though it was NOT attached to the printer).

R/CD ROMS,
  Oh, the CD-ROM formats are all standard - MSCDEX is the Microsoft
CD Rom Extensions that everyone writes to.  I've not seen one that doesn't
follow that.  It allows the drive to just be another drive letter, so you
can run programs right off the CD, copy files from it, etc.

UNIX WORKSTATIONS AND SOUND,ASDF
  What flavor of X-windows are you working with?  If I remember correctly
RS-6000's use Motif.   I've done alot of work using OpenLook, although this
project is using IXI/Motif for the GUI.
  Have you done any work with the Interface Builders for X ?
  I'm currently working on Sun Workstations, using a SPARC IPX.  I've also
done some work on NeXT machines recently.
  I'll let you know about the sound card as soon as I get it.  Should be
towards the end of this week.  It would be nice to store old vinyl discs
on my computer, but they have to first come up with a compression system.
Audio files still seem to take up alot of space.
   I'm already looking forward to the pizza party!

CACHE..,
Ward,
   Yep!!!  I remember going to the gas company on was it SHrmer
road ???   I think I may even be able to dig up a couple of old
newsletters if anyone would be interested.. ( I think I saw a small file
of CACHE stuff when I moved)?
  As for the re-union, I think it sounds great.  I already
marked it in my book.

R/CBBS 15TH *PARTY*,
  I have already contacted a cache member to tell them about the 15th
anniversary.  I DO have a mailing list.  I should get going on it!
  Should I upload a VERY large message with all the names?  I'm not
going to put the phone #'s in a public message...out of courtesy to
folks - and of course in 15 years probably about 70% of folks have moved.
46019,05,01/11/93,DAVID JOHNSON,WARD CHRISTENSEN
R/DISK CLEANUP,
Off hand, I don't remember what the overhead is, but I believe it's
fairly small.  As for the date checking, I'll have to dig up the archive
and check both that and the overhead.  Will get to it quickly and post
the answers next time I logon.
You're quite welcome!
