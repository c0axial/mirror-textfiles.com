R/32-BIT C COMPILERS,
  I demonstrated the IBM C-set/2 Workframe at the PS/2-OS/2 forum a few
weeks ago - looks like a pretty respectable product.  The thing is only
$295 from 1-800-3-IBMOS2 (soft-copy documentation only).  The many sample
programs included in the toolkit are valuable - how to do multi-threading,
how to integrate 16-bit and 32-bit applications (speaking if which, the
internal call to call from 32-bit to 16-bit is called "THUNK").
  I don't know of any others.  I've heard of only one problem with the
C-set, which had a disappointing "working as designed" answer instead of
a fix.

R/CD ROMS,
  This isn't going to be all that practical an answer, but I'll mention
a few things:
  1. you might want to consider whether you want to use a SCSI adapter for
other things, too - such as hard drive, or whether a dedicated CD-only
adapter will do the job;
  2. Consider whether audio is necessary; whether you need internal or
external; whether it needs to work under OS/2; whether you're going to
use it with multi-media applications (may require a relatively fast drive)
or just with "software"...
  A few things to think about, anyway.

REPLIES RE: CBBS,
  Ya, CBBS has been "sick" for a week or so - bad modem, finally changed
software to be more "generic" and allow other modems to work - but now
we seem to have lost MNP (error correction).
  How old were we?  Not sure of the relevance of that!	But "about" 33.
  Why create CBBS?  Well, there's a long story, but the short one was
(1) that I had an extra computer (I'd been doing some talks and bought one
to take with me); (2) Hayes had come up with the computer-controllable
internal modem; (3) I had a phone line - for club recordings about next
meeting, etc; (4) there was this terrible snow storm on Jan 16, 1978,
that kept me from going to work, so Randy and I got together by phone and
dreamed up the idea.  I thought of it being for the club, Randy said that
just we two should do it - "committee" projects just don't go anywhere.
So we just did it.  I patterned the software after the "cork board and
push-pins type of bulletin board", and coined the term "BBS" for it.
  The future of BBSs?  more specialized, more commercial, more lines,
but also a lot of people just getting into it for the fun of it.  Multi-
media, graphics (talked to a guy with A HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND graphic
images online, today - over TWENTY GIGS of disk...).
  Roll of BBSs in mass media?  Well, there will be limited exposure -
things like library BBSs or perhaps a city's or village's council BBS
or something - but still not something of general appeal - just not
a high enough percentage of people with modems yet.
  Sorry you had trouble uploading your comment.  HEY, in the future,
how about putting them in a MESSAGE instead of only-I-can-see-'em
comments?  (Well, some assistant operators can also see  'em).
  Where are you doing this article for?  Pardon if you already said, and
I've forgotten.

POCKET MEMOS,
  I have a Sharp 5200, which I'm very pleased with, but which is full.
  I understand that TODAY, Sharp came out with a YO-610, which is like
an 8600, minus the card slot, minus some function - expense, I think.
It is 128K.  THE BIG NEWS IS THAT it is as small as the 5200!  (Well,
4mm bigger in one direction, 5mm in another).
  Curious what pocket memos others have, and if you have a PC (or MAC,
etc) link.  I have the PC link for my 5200.
