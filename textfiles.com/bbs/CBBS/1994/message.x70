FILES,
  CBBS had really never had file transfer - it keeps people who
have messages to send or want to help answer, from using
the system.  Since this is the world's first BBS, I'd rather people
get a chance to sign on and see a bit of history, than get a busy
signal because someone is DLing something they could get from
any of thousands of other places anyway.

R/HELLO FROM RUSSIA,
  Oh, that's a big request - I'm not into writing long articles, and really
don't have thoughts about what's happened to BBSs.  Unfortunately, in a way,
my "fame" has allowed me to be a guest on Compuserve and BIX, and because
of that I've spent virtually NO time on any other BBSs than this one.
  What do I think of the changes in your country?  Well, sounds strange, but
I think the best is over.  The "peak" was in overthrowing the old structure,
but now you're faced with reality of a -relatively- free-market society.
Heck, here even the company I work for has an office with a couple hundred
people and I think we've declared 27 people "surplus" and they'll be offered
other jobs in the "midwest area" (meaning up to hundreds of miles away), and
others encouraged to take an offer of compensation and leave the company.
I personally have been declared in the "upper half" of ranking so am not
worried, but things are MUCH tougher with a lot bigger emphasis on selling
our services.
  How does Clipper handle Cryllic?

GOOF-PROOFING,
Give Jerry Olsen a buzz over at the Advocate, 312-939-4411 by modem (he
often logs on here, but I think he's up against some article deadlines).
A few years back he wrote a hard-drive lockout program that might be of
use in this situation,

R/DISK CLEANUP TIP,
Sounds good -- but what if you had two progams with the same name?
Then you'd still have the second one, but...!  Of course, I expect you
keep backups :-).  My solution to staring at file names is to
use 4DOS's description function so that I have a description
for all of my files that are 'non-obvious' -- \bin\util,
\bin\graphics, etc.  The description comes up when I do DIR,
and is also present if I use select del (*.*) to do some up-
cleaning.

R/DISK CLEANUP TIP,
  > What if you had two programs with the same name?
  I don't get it.  How could I?  I moved ALL my executable utilties
down to a \sys\bin\unused, then move 'em back as I need 'em.
  matter of fact I wrote a little "I.bat" that looks first for a .COM,
then a .EXE, then a .BAT, and if finding one, moves it back from
...unused to \sys\bin.
  You say your solution is to use 4DOS's description function -
my problem isn't that I don't know what they are - it is that it
would be a big process to sort thru 300 executable programs trying to
decide which you really use.  With my trick, if you try to use it,
you have to "bring it back" from the ...\unused directory.
  Actually, I have MEGABYTES to clean up on another system - but
it is not a matter of not knowing what it is, it is a matter of
trying to decide what to keep.	I have a large neough hard disk that
I've become a pack rat - I have Turbo C, 1.0, 20, Turbo C++, Borland
C++, etc.  Actually, the only one I use it Turbo C 2.0, so I'm
wondering if I should just "Blow the others away".  But then again
might be nice to keep 'em around in case I "grow" into C++..
