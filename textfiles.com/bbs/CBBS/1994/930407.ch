to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/UPGRADING PS/2

It's main use will be EE related software,circuit simulations
nothing real heavy. I know going from 640k to 2 meg involves
an expansion board that costs more than I paid for the system!
the hard drive is a bit small and I would like to add another so
could I add any IDE type controller and drive that will fit
and yes I have seen the 286-486 modules but in this case $250 or so
would be better wasted on ram,storage or a new monitor.

to ALL re: ON LINE SERVICES

I am new to modems. Please be patient with me. I have an old 8088 pc clonen
with a 40 meg hard drive. No mouse. Am interested in subscribing to an o(c)
on line service. Would appreciate any advice on subject. Am interested
in forums on health, arts, and things like that. Would like the airline re
servation lookup capability, electronic shopping, chatting, internet access
if possible, capability for international message sending - especially to
1-2 hours per week on line. Any suggestions for the best deal that would meet
most if not all of my needs? America Online was suggested to me, but I'm
modem. Thanks for any helpful suggestions! NSM, Evanston, Illinois.

to NICKI MODABER re: RE: ONLINE SERVICES

 Your have several choices. AOL you mention is one. Another
 would be CompuServe at $8.95 which gives free access to a number
 of services including airline scheduling thru Eeasy SABRE (free)
 or OAG (extra charge), various discussion forums (extra charges
 run up the bill) as well as international mail.
 The best service, which includes Internet access, is provided
 by RCI at $11 a month, and is in the "A" phone zone from
 Evanston,in the Lakeview exchange. Included is international
 mail and full Usenet news. For info dial via modem at any speed:
 312-665-0065. No time limit on usage.
