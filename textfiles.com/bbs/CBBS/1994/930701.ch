 Anyone use a "PIM" on DOS or Windows? I use ASCEND, and looked into
Lotus Organizer, which it seems we're now able to obtain from work as
part of the Lotus products the company buys.
 People at work tell me Lotus Organizer isn't as good as Ascend. (Ascend
is the one from Franklin Quest, the folks who make the "notebooks" with
special pages for calendaring, etc).
 I like things like being able to click on a 24-hour time line, drag a
bar out to the length of time you need to have an appointment, and it
automatically clicks over to the appointment schedule with the specified
time greyed out, for you to type in the name of the appointment.

Ward(xmodem):

I like Organizer myself. but I don't really work in Windows enough
to warrant using it on an ongoing basis.

Best Regards!

Ward-
I recently started using WordPerfect Office 3.1, which is (in single-use
format) a shell and some applets. The nicest one, by far, is the WP
Calendar applet, which I use as a sort of PIM (WP Notebook can be used to
do other things). The Calendar is the best of the packages I've looked
at, which admittedly, are few. It lets me track memos, appointments, andd
to-do lists. The latter I especially like, as to-do items are moved up
and reprioritized automatically. This is a DOS app. You can get a FREE
copy off the WordPerfect BBS as (I think) CL.ZIP. It's pretty cool,
takes little overhead, and works well.
