to ALL re: STACK.COM

Is anyone familiar with a TSR named STACK.COM. It does nicely what DOSKEY
makes a rather clumsy attempt at; it gives you a window of the last 15
commands you have entered and lets you pick with the arrow keys. The
problem I have is that on a computer at my office, when I attempted to
have it save a hotkey setting, it messed itself up, causing me to think
briefly that the machune had picked up a virus. The machine was a COMPAQ
486, but it works fine on another COMPAQ 486. Is there a hard disk
difference that could do this. Is there a newer version of STACK out?
or another program that is as nice?

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: HOWDEY!

Hey, Ward! you probably get this all the time gobbut I just have to add mone.
I found an old text you wrote in 1982 or earlier about xmodem and ymodem in
your first attempt to document you protocol. I'm writing a heBBS, as if
there aren't enough already, and the point of this is it is ALL PD.
I'm one of the few that think there should be atleast an equal share of quality
public domain software as comercial and sharware. Anyway, on a whim I thought
I'd see if the number at the bottom of all the pages of my very garbled
copy of your document would answer and lo' and behold! }!I'll just
brouse around and see if I can pick up any juicy file transfer protocol ^I[
info. By the way. I run a BBS, it$s new, its called the
Society for the Preservation of Obsolete Computers. It's a free BBS featuringe~
CP/M. God, where did Microsoft go wrong. What is this windows thing anyway??
My BBS number is (813)238-8076 (813)238-8076. Voice is (813)238-5279
(813)238-5279. See ya!
