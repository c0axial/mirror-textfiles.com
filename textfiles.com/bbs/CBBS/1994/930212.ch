to WARD re: MSG 46573 / CHIP

Ward,
 We have a disected battery charger ( see msg 46575). Now it sup to you
to find the spec/data sheet for the Motorola chip.

Msg 46576 is 08 line(s) on 02/08/94 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to BENJAMIN COHEN re: CHARGER

The 2N4401's are garden-variety NPN transistors. The part number on
the Motorola chip indicates that it's a recently-introduced device
(established Motorola chips begin with MC, new parts with XC). The
second part of the number sounds like a location/date code, with the
date of manufacture probably late last year (presumably the "36" means
the 36th week of 93). Part numbers beginning with "78" are usually
voltage regulators, though specialized battery-charger chips might
fall into that range too.
