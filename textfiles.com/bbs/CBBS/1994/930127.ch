]Ward, when are we going to have Thai food again?  I've
been hibernating and building toys.
Been playing with a new outliner - Kamas on my HP95lx.
Nice...  have you tried it?

Look in your config.sys - the device=himem statement should give the
path of the file - i.e. where it expects it - could be c:\dos or
d:\windows or anything - just copy the file from your floppy to that
directory.
 As to your comment about graphics, sorry, this is the worlds first
BBS, it is by definition a "historical relic". As author of it (about
16 years ago) I really HATE graphics, because they are so impossible
to capture or upload - I prefer text - when I see something interesting
I can capture it, and when I have some stored info to upload, I can
send it character by character. I tried Prodigy, but being graphics made
me feel so much like I was playing a video game - when people would
ask a question that I had a STORED answer to, there was no practical way
to upload it, and when I found something useful, I couldn't save it, etc.
I dropped it.
 The only graphics environment online that I will accept is AOL, because
at least I can open arbitrary files (admittedly with a HORRIBLE file
manager that doesn't sort by anything but name, and has no dates) and clip
them to/from a clipboard, etc.
 Good luck with your himem.

I dunno about the LaserJet, but I have a little bactch program that
handles set-up codes on the DJ500, and prints envelopes as well. It's
simple, but it works. Actually, printing envelopes on the LJ and DJ
would be quite different, since on the LJ you have to switch to
landscape mode. My program requires 4DOS and an editor that can write
to PRN:. If you're interested, lemme know here or at marchana@gar.union.edu
and I'll send you a copy. Actually, come to think of it, it's already
posted on oak.oakland.edu and other SIMTEL mirrors as 4djpset.zip, in
the 4DOS area. You can get it via anonymous FTP.

we are looking for file transfer software that uses the
