MSG RETENTION,NONO
You ask how long messages are retained here.  They remain until they
are removed by the original author, the addressee, or Ward or an assistant
operator, who take them off the top when the active message base
approaches its limit.  If you do r;1 you will see that at this time
the messages go back to Oct 1991.

R/MSG RETENTION,
I did a R;1 command and it told me that message 1 wasn't found. I typed
the plus key to scan for the next 10. Still nothing. I pressed the plus
key about 5 more times and I finally gave up and typed S;1 and it
reported the first message number was 45169. So to make an already long
story short... just type R;45169 to see the first message.    ;-)

CONGRATS!,
Glad you brought it back up again!  I've really missed CBBS while it was down;
seems like seeing an old friend after a long time.  Antique or not,
CBBS has a definite place, rest assured!  Not only is it the world's
first, but the "compact" (terse) message style suits me better than the
constant drivel found on so many other boards.	Thanks!!  -Marty.

INFO ON SCSI CTLR.,TTTT
Does anyone have any info pro/con on a SCSI controller manufactured
by CE Infosys?	(Model C5610)
I purchased and installed one based on what the distributor told me
and it seemed like such a piece of cake.  (I used it in conjunction
with a Seagate st14766n (663M) hd. for a client.)
I tried it installed as the boot drive and also with the driver as
a second drive, (after an IDE boot drive), and it appeared to work
positively super.
In the handbook it talked about connecting CD roms and other devices.
The price was <$100 which is cheaper than most I've seen.
I am asking the question because I've never heard of this controller
in any of the magazines, computer shopper, etc.
Any comments?

R/386DX "FEATURE",
Thanks for your response.  My main concern was whether this "feature"
made the early 386DX to some small extent incompatible with 8086 machine
code.  (For instance, setting STD as the default instead of CLD, or some
such arcanum.)

MNP BACK ON CBBS,
  Randy got the modem "zapped" to support MNP - I got "CONNECT 2400/ARQ"
tonight, so it seems to work fine.  Should help the folks getting some
line noise, such as you, Michael...
  Let me know how it works.

R/TELCO QUESTION,
yes they can..... It's one of thoese thecnological advances years ago,
the equipment to support TT was cheaper than rotary, also there was
so many rotary phones out there it wasn't worth their while to try
and charge people for TT service.  The local operating telephone
company normally catches people when they move, they ask you if the
phoenes your taking with you are TT.  For those of us who haven't
moved for a while...... they don't know.   IL Bell started a campain
s ago to boos ago to boost their profit my asking their entire customer
base if they using TT or rotary phones.  They call up our house and
asked my kids when they answered the phone, and guess what, next
month was a charge for TT service. If you tell then you don't use TT
service they "may" just turn the your service down to accept rotary only.
After I complained about the charge, they dropped the charge, AND REVERTED
my service to rotary. Doesn't make any difference to me as that line is
used for incoming only!
So be prepaired...

PIZZA PARTY LIST,
  What do you think I should do - should I check with the current CACHE
officers to see if they "OK" using the old list?  Do you want to take
part of the list?  Actually, I may have one on 8" disk, and by moving
some hardware around I might be able to actually read it!
46031,09,01/17/93,ROY LIPSCOMB,WARD
PIZZA PARTY LIST,
I imagine they would not object to your using the list for that
purpose.  I also have a feeling that it would be at least courteous
to get such permission, since the list actually is the property of
CACHE.	But my original thoughts were that CACHE might run a note in
their newsletter, for the old timers or for anyone, as you deem best;
and that perhaps CACHE would provide an updated list for those old
timers who are still around.  For my part, I guess I was offering to
call a subset of old timers on the list; but maybe postcards would be
less work.  What do you think?
