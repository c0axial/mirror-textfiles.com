R/COPH,
Well I realize this is the wrong computer platform, but the following
information can be of some good for someone. I know that a Commodore
64 has a number of cards that allows your computer to talk. One even
allows your computer to listen too. In fact, the card manufacturer is
called: Hearsay, Inc; 1825 74th Street; NY, NY 11204; and they made
IBM version too. I am not sure if they did for the MAC or not.

Now I know that there are some educational programs that work very
well with the above mentioned cards on the C64. There is also an
excellent word processor that even talks called "The Write Stuff" and
works without any extra hardware. Also there is a communications
program called SAMTERM, but it is really slow. You even had to hit
CTRL-S once in awhile even at 300 baud, so the term could keep up
with the BBS.

4 MEG DRAM'S?,
I just read an article in the Economist about the newest type
of memory invented in Japan an captilized in the US, called
flash memory. But the article memtioned that a 4 meg by 1 bit
DRAM chip goes for about $15 each. I have 1 meg by 1 bit DRAM
chips, but can't find the 4 meggers? Anyone see the 4 meg DRAMS?

MNP TECHNICAL DATA,ASDF
I am researching a technical paper on MNP modem protocols. I have some basic
data on the overview of each of the 10 levels, but need to get to the next l
level of technical details for this paper. Does anyone know where I may find
a reference manual,etc. on perhaps MNP 5 data compression techniques, etc.
I have tried to speak to tech support at Microcom directly but they did not
seem to have any leads. Any help in the right direction would be really
appreciated.

R/CD ROMS,
Like most things, you must match what you purchase with your intended uses.
But for starters, you should look for three things:  access speed; whether
the MS CD-ROM Extensions file Ward mentioned in fact is supplied; and
whether the interface is supplied in the base price.
	A few of the VERY lowest-end products file to provide the .EXE
file. Many charge extra (as much as $100) for the interface). Access
speed is a more complex subject and directly relates to your current and
future plans. If you simply want to read files from the drive, anything
around 340ms access time is fine. But for technical reasons, if you plan
to do such things as use reference-book CDs which demand random access of
index files, you may want something much faster.
	With careful shopping, the lower end of decent products can now be
had in the U.S. for under $350; higher-end products double or triple that.
	The shortest answer for users who don't need a lot of searching
capability (or who are willing to wait for the delays) is simply to look
for a product with the MPC (Multimedia PC Council) compliance logo.
	BTW, the cheapest of the CDs with solid specs has been the Sony
CDU-535. After eval-ing various alternatives for an article, that's the one
I personally settled on...which is about the best endorsement I probably
can make. <G>
	FWIW, if you want a detailed expansion of the above plus a survey
of a couple of dozen shareware CD disks, one version of my article will
appear in Shareware Magazine, whose Nov/Dec issue should show up at news
outlets and computer stores any day now.
	Good luck.

R/LIMITING SOFTWARE APPLICATIO,
My Sci America arrived on the day that I posted the message.  It is the
Nov 92 issue with a picture of an ant holding a micro-gear.  The article
title is "Software 'glitches' that endanger public safety."
I have come to the tentative conclusion that even software needs the
wisdom gained from actual experience.

DJ500 PROBLEM (!),
     I have a problem with my DeskJet 500.  Since problems with the DJ are
so rare, I thought I publish a note here.  Maybe someone will also have
a remedy.
     I've been using a serial cable with the DJ for about nine months and
have had no problems.  A few days ago, I switched to a parallel cable,
bought new.  In printing a long document, the DJ started out by printing
fine.  But I noticed later that it had printed a spurious "$" on pages 70,
86, 116, (two of them on) 160, and 176.  When I individually reprinted
the pages, one of the pages again featured a renegade "$" (in a different
spot than before).
     I called Elektek, and a techie there said he had a problem like this
with his DJ, and he cured it by removing the clips that secure the parallel
cable connector to the DJ.  Sounds like voodoo technomatics to me.
     Has anyone else encountered this problem?

TELCO QUESTION,
I recently received a notice (via bulk mail) from ma bell saying that I h
have been receiving touch tone service without being charged for
it. The notice went on to saythat for xx cents a month I could
continue it. One of their telemarketers left a message to the
same effect on my answering machine today. The question: does the
telco really have the ability to switch their equipment so that it
won't recognize my modem and pulse-tone switchable tones?

WHY DO 486'S GET HOT?,
A fellow I know says that 486 DX2s run at better than 200 degrees
Fahrenheit.  I'm curious as to what specifically causes a chip to
generate heat, given a fixed operating voltage.  Is it due to the
narrowness of the interconnections between the transistors?  Is it
due to the number of transistors?  Is it due to the speed of
the on/off switching of the transistors?  (Perhaps a better question
is, How much is due to each of these factors, and how much is due
to others.)

RE: WHY DO 486'S GET HOT,
The newer generation of CPU's run hot for two reasons:
	1) Speed, the faster you switch, the more heat you generate.
	2) There are Xx10e6 components in a very small area.
I would think that the biggest factor is a function of both, but
really is just of function of speed, since that is also a
driving factor towards smaller sizes.
