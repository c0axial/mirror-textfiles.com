Heh, this being the ORIGINAL BBS is running on CP/M - sort of - it is
running an emulator that needs a V-20 chip for the 8080 emulation, and
software to make PC-DOS look like an 8080. Something like 20K lines
of assembler code.

Msg 46578 is 02 line(s) on 02/18/94 from WARD CHRISTENSEN

Don't forget this sat 2:00 PM the 19th is the CBBS 16th anniversary party.
