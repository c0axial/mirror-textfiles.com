R/HARD DISKS,
Oh great... now I read your message 45632 about Conner 20 Meg HD. I just
bought one a few weeks back and the darn thing died on me. The logic
curcuits appear to be okay, it's just that the drive won't spin when
requested to do so... what a rip... $300 I paid for it too.

CACHE REUNION?,
  Anyone think it would be interesting to try to get together folks
from the OLD CACHE organization - say late 70's, early 80's?  It could
be a 15-year reunion maybe based upon old lists.  Lets see, Roy Lipscomb,
Gerry Swetsky, Bill Precht, Rob't Swartz, Lloyd Smith, Bill B.. (The NI
Gas Guy), etc?	Wonder how successful it would be.

R/MNP TECHNICAL DATA,
Thanks for your help on this. I really appreciate it.

CD-ROM,
Ward...not to interject where not wanted, but I seem to remember OS2
only supports two CD-ROM drives. There is a ZIP file available with a
replacement CD-ROM driver for OS2 that is supposed to support more
drives than the 2 IBM likes. Available on C'Serve, and I also have it
if you like...can't remember it's name but can dig it out. Where can
one get info on the IBM Developer's CD-ROM you mentioned in your
message? I've also heard something about a beta test of developer's
something-or-other. Any info on such??? P.S. I'm referring to 2 CD-ROM
drive manufacturers, maybe one was Toshiba, would have to look in the
above-mentioned ZIP file.		...Regards

R/CD-ROM,
  Ya, IBM & Toshiba were the only 2 supported - but there are rumors
of being able to patch others in - you patch in the name of the drive
in the driver so when the drive ID's itself the driver sez "OK".  I
hadn't heard of the zip file you're referring to.  Still quite up in the
air as to what direction to go.
  I don't know what the deal was on the developers CD-rom.  I think the
guy who said he was getting me one didn't, for I've seen him several times
and he never mentioned it (and I didn't think of it).
  The only beta test I know of is for C++, but don't know if it is external
or not.  There is something like a "developer's Assistance Program" (DAP)
but not sure how you'd enroll in it.  I think the general IBM 800 # is
1-800-IBM-3333, they might know.

HP DJ500C CARTRIDGES,DEVO
Over the past year I have collected a number of printer cartridges. I've
refilled them with other colors other than black and thats worked fine.
The problem I'm having is keeping the ink jet end from drying up
between uses... There was a nice little container for storing the cartridges
that came with the machine.  Has anyone seen an after market  device that
will hold 3-5 cartridges??????
Also, has anyone seen kits for filling the tri-colored cartridge? Has
anyone been successful in filling one of those cartridges??

PHONE NOISE,
Ward,
   I had that connect 1200 happen also.  If the burst of noise comes while
the modem is cheking the 2400 speed they miss 'handshaking' and it
skips down ( it seems that what happened)  I'll try complaining about a
multiplexer to Ma Bell.  I have called repair 4 times now and they keep
saying there is no problem, yet I continue to get noise calling here and
one other location in the same switch.	I also had a client with the same
problem in Buffalo Grove to libertyville call, and again Bell said no
problem was found, but the problem also went away after they tested it.
I don't think MNP will help this severe of a noise problem, there are
actual clicks and pops in the line.

R/PIZZA PARTY LIST,
  I ran into a current cache member on America Online, and I wrote a
little piece for him to do - either just bringing up in the meeting,
or put in the newsletter, so we're at least somewhat "covered" in that
area.
  Dunno about post cards vs calling...I guess selfishly I'd like to
contact the folks I REMEMBER - but I'll bet there would be familiar faces
whose name I'd not associated with it...

R/PIZZA PARTY LIST,
At roughly what year does your memory fade?
