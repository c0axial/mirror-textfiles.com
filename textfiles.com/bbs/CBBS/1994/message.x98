R/MANDELBROT,
  Gee, do you have a VGA?  You ought to get Fractint.  It is an incredibly
fast fractal program, available on most of the boards.	Actually it will
run on a CGA even (I've used it on an XT-compatible laptop, years ago)
and the features are just outstanding.	The speed makes it practical to
do a lot with it.

DATA ON FM SUBCARRIER?,
  I thought I once heard something about data being broadcast on those
SCA thingies (Sub Carier Authority) - like how Muzak gets broadcast?
Anyone have any details?
  P.S. CBBS co-founder Randy Suess just got a satellite hookup for
the news feed for his Unix system!

R/DESKJET EXPERIENCES,
  Upstate NY?  I'd forgotten!
  I'm going to a meeting tomorrow where I might commit a lot of funds,
I'll probably just keep what I've got - it is pretty new and lightly
utilized, so I should probably just keep using it instead of pressing
my nose on ElekTek's window looking @ THE DJ550C...
  Gee, just went to see what t new one would cost - the doggone ElekTek
has the DJ as "fair traded" or whatever it is that makes it NOT a catalog
item!
  Lets assume I'm just going to keep it - if something comes up soon that
makes me want to go to the new one (like a particular task better suited
to the mixed black/color environment) I'll see if you've done something
else or not.

R/RE: TOYS,
Yeah. You're right about the PC hookup -- I was amazed
when I saw the price (today).  Still, it's a really nice little
critter.  Keyboard has little rubber keys, a one-time SHIFT as well
as a CAPS LOCK.  Everything beeps when you hit it, don't know if it
can be silenced, but the beep is nice with something that small.  The
screen was good and I THINK it had adjustable contrast.  Once nice
feature (from my point of view) was that there was nothing electronic
in the TOP of the case -- it was just a door, with some instructions
pasted in it.  That helps make this a thin little unit.

TOYS,
I got a Fotoman (actually I bought it a few weeks before Xmas). Takes
up to 32 pictures (Black & White) which then download into the computer
via a serial link. You use a Windows program to preview & edit them.
Pretty nice. Needless to say this years Xmas cards included the dreaded
Xmas letter With PICTURES! I'm learning there is quite difference in
taking photos with the Fotoman then a real camera.
It will be making an appearance at the CBBS birthday party. I would like
to know if anyone will be bringing a laptop/notebook that is capable
of running Windows?? If so I will bring the software and we can view/edit
the pictures...right away!  Perhaps a "group" photo of those that attend!
