MOTHER BOARD?,
Am thinking of jumping to a 33 from a 16 mHz 386, but with
another manufacturer's board (Vektron). The price for a
-386-33 with 8 meg is $530.00. Is it worth jumping
to the 33 from the 16? Richard Hinton

R/DISK FORMAT SOFTWARE,
   I've noticed this phenomenon with a bit of glee; isn't it interesting
when IBM comes out with non-IBM-compatible computers?  Think back to the
first IBM portable...  :-)

R/BOOKS,
You may have some luck investigating the used book stores around the
University of Chicago. Best wishes...

R/FAX,
  Hey, that Faxability sounds cool - especially the OCR.
  Tell me, is there a simple editor shipped with it?  One problem I saw
was if you faxed something into your system, in order to fax it out (i.e.
you wanted a graphic image but didn't have a scanner) then you were sending
out a fax with YOUR INCOMING header on it.  A simple editor to chop that
off would be useful.
  I realize that since you said it could be saved in a bunch of formats,
you could drop it into, say, PC Paintxxx but that would be an extra step,
and come to think of it, an 8.5" wide 200-dpi image by 11" long (or
longer) would be quite LARGE and ungainley to "quickly edit".

R/MODEM PROBLEM,
  How about slowing down the speed at which you send the ATDT - i.e.
send it at about 10 char/sec?  I can do that in my current COMM program.

R/DISK CLEANUP TIP,
Ward, you mention that you use aliases.  Are you using 4DOS?  If
so, I have a neat .BTM file that sets up the DeskJet...if you're
interested.
