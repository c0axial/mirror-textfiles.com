LIMITING SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS,OGEN
This month's Scientific America carries an article about limiting
software applications in some situations because of the
possiblity of bugs.  The mathematical proof of the impossible
situation of eliminating all bugs other than by trial and
error was proved earlier this century by Godel.  I hope this is
of interest to some.

CBBS DOWN & BACK UP,NONE
  Well, sorry for our un-reliability again!  This time the HST power supply
died, and CBBS was too specific to that modem to work with others.
  We're now on a Practical Peripherals 2400, with MNP capability, but it
does not seem to be going MNP.
  Randy sez that CBBS should be "generic" so any modem can be hung on it -
i.e. he'll init the modem with a terminal or terminal program, then CBBS
should just "connect".	I think the default must not be MNP.  He'll check
further, and I'll do what programming is necessary.
  CBBS has to at least hang in there long enough to get ot its 15th
anniversary celebration next February!	Lets see, Saturday the 13th
of Feb should be the Sat closest to the 16th if I guestimated right...
for Pizza at Barnaby's on Touhy near California, 2:00 PM.  (but call back
for particulars in early Feb).
  Thanks for calling CBBS - we enjoy having you.

MODEM SIGNALS,
  Curious about something - our modem drivers for sending chars checked
if the transmit holding register was empty, then looped making sure clear
to send and data set ready were there, then send the char.  When the HST
modem died, (power supply problems) and we tried other modems, they would
"hang".  Is it normal these days for modems to not assert these signals?
  Thanks!
  P.S. a change in the drivers to ignore CTS/DSR was what got it going
again...

R/LASERJET 4M,
Around Thanksgiving time there were NO IV-M's to be found anywhere.  They
have begun to ship units now, but they seem to be moving slowly.
Distributors seem to be getting several at a time.  Eventually supply
will catch up, but it seems that with the 'hold' demand grew while the
printers were waiting for the upgrade.

HEARD OF ASC SYSTEMS,
I came across an XT box that consists of 5 mono cards and 256K on the
motherboard.  There are 3 ROMS (1 is BIOS)

	There also is a DTMF decoder card with 5 RJ-11 jacks in.  When
booting up each screen says SCREEN(1-5) depending on the card.	I have
not been able to find the company, ASC Systems to find out if this thing
does anything useful.  ANy info would be appreciated.
ity, but it
does not seem to be going MNP.
