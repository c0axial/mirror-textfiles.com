PD TCP/IP FOR FTP?,BLAH
I'm looking for a public domain version of TCP/IP that features the
following items:  SLIP and automatic dialing (to dial the terminal
server).  I guess FTP is a given.

Does such a creature exist?  I downloaded a package from ftp.ncsa.uiuc.
edu, but it only works with network adapters, not modems.  Does anyone
know of an ftp site that has what I need?

Thanks.

I have been using the book "The Armchair Universe" by A.K. Dewdney. I a
ing to make a program that lets you zoom in on the "Mandelbrot Set" fractal
As far as his program describes it I am doing everything he says. If
anyone knows how to make the program (in basic) or has the book tell me.
I have the IBM compatible GW-Basic.

R/ALL COMMAND.COM'S IDENTICAL?,
Ward, my DOS 5.0 also has COMMAND.COM AS 47845 bytes,
but the date/time is 11-11-91  5:00.
Bill, my DOS 3.3 COMMAND.COM (Zenith) is listed as
25532 in length (vs your 25644).  In my edition of DOS 3.3
COMMAND.COM, the errorlevel is at offset 0BEA
(when COMMAND.COM is loaded.  The file offset is
100H less).
  Incidentally, to locate that byte, I used a trick
Ward suggested years ago for locating the USER
byte in the CP/M BDOS:	Set the USER to one value,
copy the BDOS, set the USER to another value, copy
the BDOS again, compare the two copies to find
the byte that differs and reflects the two USER
values that you individually set.
  Thanks for your responses.

QUESTION ON GUEST ACCESS,
Randy,
When you have guest access on 283-0559, (login evans) I don't quite
understand if guests can post to the net at all (or just on
weekends). Your message on this was not clear to me.
If I want to post do I need contributor access, or are guests just
limited to certain time slots?	My internet address is
evans@ihlpm.att.com.
Thanks for the help.

R/INTERGATED VOICE,
By the way, do you still have the voice card or did you sell it?
If you did sell it, is there anyone in Chicago that sells this type
of product?  The MFG refered me to Comp USA, they don't know what I'm
talking about nor does Tiger Software. Guess I'll have to make some more
phone calls! Thanks...

R/DESKJET EXPERIENCES,
Well, how much would you want?	  I'm serious, a money IS a consideration,
and I trust you took good are of the critter.  Remember that one of us
would have to pay shipping to upstate NY.  If you'd really be willing
to sell the printer, call me at (518) 382-1880, evenings, until 11:00
Eastern time.  Thanks!

R/NEW TOYS?,
  I, too, got a Sportster 2400/9600 modem (for work), and WinFaxPro, but
it would NOT work under OS/2.  I understand release 3 should work, but
instead I took it back and bought PM FAX, which I've not had time to try.
  MTEZ is kind of funny - not sure I understand it.  I know that higher
levels of MNP implement synchronous transfer, to avoid the time wasted
by sending start and stop bits, and obviously software can't do that.

R/RE: TOYS,
  I gave my brother a Sharp 5200 for Xmas - the only reason I did was
that he was interested in a "Brother" or "Royal" or some "off" brand,
that was about as big, but not as full featured.  This way I can
back his up (occasionally) when I visit, etc.  Also I can help him with
usage tips (and he taught me a thing or two by more patiently reading
the book).
  SMALL - "really small" - would be a distinct advantage - and being able
to hook to a PC is important (but typically, expensive: nearly $100).
 message on this was not clear to me.
