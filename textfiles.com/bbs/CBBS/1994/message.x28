R/MNP TECHNICAL DATA,
  Microcom sells the spec - I think for a nominal fee.	I found someone
in Hayes willing to mail me a 6-page doc, we'll see what I get.

R/CD ROMS,
  Have you gotten into the OS/2 issues of CD-roms?  I'm running OS/2
now and then, and would like to get the IBM developer's CD-ROM, so
I want an OS/2 compatible one.	Also I'd LOVE for it to hook to my
IN-2000 controller, though I may be going to an Ultrastor 14F.

R/AS00,
  Give us a clue - what kind of "clues" are you looking for?  Actually,
I don't think I've ever seen an AS/400 question here...
  I'm trying to remember - hmmm - I vaguely recall a "midrange" BBS
somewhere that I think catered to AS/400 folks.  But I don't have a shot
at remembering it.  Perhaps someone else will.
  Where 'ya going to school?  What is the name/content of the course?
(if you feel like being "chatty").

PENTIUM: 64 BIT?,
  Is the 586 64 bits externally?  I recall IBM saying the model 90 and 95
were the most "likely" to be able to handle a Pentium, since it used a
dual-path to memory - BUT - I think that was for "memory interleave", and
that is a performance thing.  If the 586 would use BOTH paths, the memory
would be slower, I think!

SPEECH INPUT?,
  Well, carpal tunnel is getting to me - my left hand hurts, back of
hand "tingles"... It is time for voice input!  Do any of them really work?

R/SPEECH INPUT?,
Dragon Dictate really does work, although it has its quirks (when you're
getting started with it, it will often come up with truly weird guesses
as to what you're saying, though you always get a chance to correct
them).	VoiceType from a company that you're probably quite familiar
with works pretty much the same (Dragon did the program design), but
has a smaller built-in vocabulary.  All of these are discrete-word
recognizers; you have to pause between words.  They're also memory
hogs.

A number of companies are now coming out with multiple-piece keyboards
where the pieces can be oriented to whatever angle keeps the stress
off your wrists.

Maybe I should write a TSR that measures the rate and number of keystrokes
and pops up a "give your wrists a break" message if you've been going
at it too long.  Part of the problem is that your tendons swell up
more if you don't give them a chance to recover; if you take appropriate
pauses, you can get away with a lot more abuse.
