to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: ONE BBSCON

Yep, that's how I see it - totally commercial. Not that that isn't
interesting, but there are people there who mostly are in it for the
money - or who wouldn't be if it weren't for the money, at least.
 Unless someone comes begging, I'm not planning to go. Mucho $. Heh,
if I ran a board for money, I could (1) afford to go; and (2) write it
off as a (legit) business expense.
 Uh, sorry, I have to remember to call HERE more often!

 Right, I took the Ward Board down on New Years Eve. I saw no point
in getting a call or less per day. no messages. It had no historical
significance, and I saw no reason to keep it going. Heck, the MONITOR
died YEARS ago and so did the 2nd drive, so it was running without
backups, blind, but still cranking away.
 I'm not interested in keeping S-100 hardware going. So I killed it.
 Thanks for the kind offers of hardware!

So-what are you going to do? I must admit that I like this board the
way it is-even if it DOES sometimes make me nostalgic for my old Z80
machine-and I'd hate to see it die. Hmm. I know this is going to
A) sound silly, and B) get somebody telling me how awful the government
is, but have you considered getting a grant to pay for the (minimal)
operating expenses that this board incurs? I mean, one of the reasons
that some of us would like to see CBBS-1 keep operating is simply the
fact that it's an historic board. It has SIGNIFICANCE. I wonder if
there might not be a good source of funds out there somewhere.

Andy, The problem with "funding" is that as soon as the government gets
involved the project seases to be yours and starts to be the government's.
Ever been to South Dakota and seen "Crazy Horse" ? Those guys won't
touch government money because they don't want the meddling.
