Boy, I have NO idea. Since I became a "product" (PC) marketing specialist,
I haven't even ordered any manuals for myself. We DO have a look-up
system ("BOIS" - Branch Office Information System), but I have NO idea
where you go to actually ORDER manuals.
 I'll bet this is a question the main IBM operators get all the time -
you might just call 245-2000 and see if they know. I'll be out at
customers.

Dunno much about STACK.COM, but 4DOS (a version of which comes with Norto
Utilities under the name NDOS) includes a better command line history
than DOSKEY. It has sophisticated command line completion so that if
you enter DIR and press up arrow it will bring backe the last command
line that began with DIR. 4DOS has dozens of other useful features,
including multiple commands on a single line, batch-to=memory files that are
read into memory all at once instead of one line at a time, multiple
arguments for most dos commands (copy this that andother b: copies all
three specified files to b:), aliases, and echoes the names of deleted
files (I can't believe that we're at DOS 6 - and Novell DOS 7 - and
neither of them echoes the names of deleted files!). Go for it!

Jim Coates wrote about aging CMOS batteries last Sunday in the
Tribune. Here's a note I emailed to him in response:

jcoats1@aol.com
/R
I saw your article (about aging CMOS batteries) in the Chicago TRIBUNE,
Another problem with very old PCs that is starting to appear is hard-disk
demagnetization.
A few months ago, my PC began to act strange. It would pause during the
access of a certain file on the hard disk; make a long, slow seek
(evidentally to the diagnostic cylinder); then slowly seek back and
continue reading the file. Two days ago, I noticed the same symptom on
a friend's computer.
In both cases, a check of the FAT map showed that there were no clusters
near the hub for either of the files in question. Both our machines are
about nine or ten years old.
I completely cured the problem on my machine by simply running SPINRITE,
and I hope to do the same for my friend's machine very soon.
Thanks for bringing the CMOS battery problem to our attention.

hi ward. it's been a long time since i logged on, but my wife rememebered
the exchange and i remembered the number. this was the first bbs we logged
in to and it's a great pleasure to drop in again. i think that was about
the time you all started up, and i want to extend my thanks for all the
good work you've provided for us over the years. it was a pretty good idea
back then and i'm so happy to have been a part of it. i'm looking at my
calendar now, and i see grey's lake on march 27th. that's always been a
pretty good hamfest, so i think we'll head up there to see what's
available, junkwise and for weird small parts. are you on packet? i moved
back downtown recently, and haven't gotten a IP station
up cuz the rf links are questionable, but that's the plan. we'll see what
capra comes up with. again, thanks for everything. it's been great, and we
all owe you all so much. so let's see if i remember the cbbs command for
sending a message. kevin h & marie sarapata
.
no that's not it.

to ALL re: FREE ASR-33 TTYS!

I will give away to the first takers 2 ASR-33 Teletypes
which were working when last used 2 or 3 years ago.
They must be picked up in Lake Forest-I cannot ship!
Possibly some manuals also. Here is a chance to acquire
a piece of history-the price is right!
Call 708-234-3000 Ext. 371 and leave message.
