HEY! This is pitiful! Have things gone so far in BBS land that nobody
talks anymore? I was noticing that the messages here are few and far-
between, and I began to wonder (actually, I'm certain!) if we've seen the
end of the BBS revolution. I use a number of boards in Upstate NY, and the
level of message traffic is minimal. People log on, download, and log
out. 'BBS' isn't the right name-these things are, by and large, file
servers. And, worse, most of them have the SAME files, thanks to CD
technology. Whatever happened to unique boards with special software, and
better still, special groups of users? Remember (anyone?) when CBBS used
to get 20+ messages a DAY? it wasn't that long ago! SIGH. (flame out)

to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/NOTHING IN PARTIC

I was just thinking myself about the lack of messages here. I
call Compuserv a few times month and learn a lot there. Here I
have left messages and quiries and sometimes I don't get replies.
Usually on Compuserv I get lots of answers.
SO! What servive would you call?
Keep on communicating!

 Yep, that's the state of BBSs. You see hundreds if not thousands of
people logging on to AOL, to chat. It has turned into the social meeting
place of the 90s. Talk about "safe sex"!
 CBBS was originally (still is, actually) set up as a message board, with
NO files, intentionally, to encourage people to participate.
 But people want slick menus, colors, graphics, etc. Things that don't
add to the message content, but make it easier or more interesting to
use.
 The same thing is happening at the BBS conventions - well, no, what I mean
is I enjoyed the first year of ONE BBSCON, and somewhat less the 2nd, but
this year I assume there will be 2,000 people there, and I would be quite
bored going to it - so right now I am not going. It is totally commercial.
People with dozens of lines, X.25 links, banks of CD-ROMS, etc.
 The main reason CBBS has become so light in use is that it has been down
a lot - as much as 3 months - so "regulars" got out of the habit of calling.
Also people want better software. Heck, I once rode in a model T, and I
wouldn't have changed it! This is a "ride in the model T" except that
it can still be useful, but doesn't have the message traffic sufficient to
get it.
 CBBS' modem seems shot - it kept hanging up on me, and only runs at 2400.
Deep down, I almost think CBBS should just be taken down.

Msg 46643 is 20 line(s) on 05/08/94 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to WARD re: CBBS DOWN?

HEAVEN FORFEND! Seriously, Ward, CBBS is in many ways what I think a BBS
OUGHT to be like. It's lean, it's clean. Perhaps if you set it up with a
faster modem (9600?) and advertised it nationally, it might take off.

The costs are high, though-and I'm just an addict, so I call even from
out of town.

What I really miss is the THRILL of logging into a new board and discovering
something new or unexpected. But I'm seeing more and more boards with
ZERO message traffic, and some that won't even take uploads. Why? We'll
wait until it comes out on the CD!

These days, about the only new software I see is that put up in internet
archives like oak.oakland.edu, and the message traffic is usenet. Ahh,
for the good old days!

Please DON'T take CBBS down. If worst comes to worst, maybe you could
find some newer software and still run a single-conference, message-only
board (OK, give them a little color, and maybe they'll come). But I
suppose that it could never be the same.

Msg 46644 is 14 line(s) on 05/08/94 from BILL MATTSON
to WARD/ ALL re: CBBS

Ward.some random thoughts. I note that the Ward Board no longer answers,
although I don't remember any info suggesting it was down, went down, or
was going down. So.first thought: Why not take CBBS down and move all
to Ward Board. This would seem much more convenient for you, the phone
line aside. Second thought: I'll give you an ALTOS Z80 system board, or
if you wish, an entire ALTOS 8000-10A, (serial, parallel, 8-inch FD's,
and 10-meg HD, CP/M, original distb'n diskettes, manuals), and donate
some $ for a decent MODEM, to run the original code native. Third
thought: Spite is a virtue.I've been calling here for a LONG time, and
and would really like to see the old CBBSOSAURUS.REX stay around as a
benchmark of how we all started out in this. Sentimental fool that I am.
Fourth thought: A MODEM faster than 2400 bps is really sort of overkill
on a system intended for message traffic, rather than file traffic, so
maybe someone has an extra MODEM they're not using. Regards

To the gentleman claiming no response on a message left here: I don't
believe it. I have never seen a message asking for information go
un-answered here.
Ward: I just signed up to goto ONE-BBSCON. you're scarring me!
I am probably inthe minority, but I have so far avoided all national
(suck lots of money out of your wallet) services. I have always been able
to find the files I need locally, and really get almost any technical
problem resolved via peoplr here at CBBS.
 When I want files I go elsewhere. When I want to talk to people who
know what they are talking about I come here. People who know that
mico-computers used to have less than 16Meg in them and you could actually
accomplish something with them.
 CBBS is sort of like the Coke bottle: A timeless classic.

to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/WINDOWS NT/ NT SERVER

We have been using NT Advanced Server about about 6 months. We have a
900+ workstation lan with about 15 servers. We chose NT because
it was the logical sucessor to Lan Manager. Right now, about 1/2 the
servers are Lan Man, the rest are NT. We have found it to be a stable
and very capable server OS. We were able to get around many of the
limitations of MS Lan Manager/OS2 1.3 without upgrading any of the request
software. HOWEVER, if you have any OS/2 workstations on your lan.
lookout! We have experienced a number of flakey problems using
OS/2 in our predominantly Microsoft lan. Support from IBM on these
OS2 crashes has been marginal at best. Finger pointing is common
between these two vendors. But overall, our NT experience
has been very positive (perhaps because we only run it on our file
servers - not on user workstations).
