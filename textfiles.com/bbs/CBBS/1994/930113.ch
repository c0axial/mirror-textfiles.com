]Ward,  What's up with 849-1132?  Rec'd no answer...  Has it been determined
who's doing the Jan APCU meeting?  If it's Katz that's fine but I need
to know whether to prepare or not!  Did Gary get in touch with you
on the room assignments (he had Stuart 104 for Jan/Feb and a diff.
room for Mar (althoughyou mentioned Mar would be downtown so that wouldn't
matter)....

to ALL re: WINDOWS NT/ NT SERVER

Has anyone worked with NT in any depth. AS I have been reading the
reviews more closely, it seems that maybe it was a biger 'leap' in
technology then people are ready to accept on their desktop.
What about compatability? I know it supports, DOS, WIndows, OS/2 file
structure ( I don't know about runnning OS/2 in an NT window. that would
be neat) Mac file services, and multiple protocols easily.
 If you are using it, where and why??? Is it ready to replace the
traditional Novell file server in today's office??

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/GOOD CONNECTION

u're quite right, sometimes i can see the whole message full of quotes and j
just a few actual lines. that ain't writing a msg is all about right!?
it's right, the first BBS in the world should keep on running. it can act
as your computer answering machine. i'm trying to set up a msg based bbs here
alot off bbs in my country carry files and some echos. well, i just want to
make minne sort of like an answering machine.
