to KEVIN HUOTARI re: R/HAMFESTS

 Thanks, nice to hear from you again. Grays Lake Hamfest, is that the one
up near the Wisconsin border? I recall going to that one about a year ago.
 Thanks for all the kind words!
 Heh, no, '.' isn't how you get out of input mode on CBBS - it is just a
blank line.

Msg 46598 is 25 line(s) on 03/11/94 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/ALZHEIMER'S AND OLD PCS

 Thanks for the msg, Roy. That "long seek" you found was NOT to the
diagnostic cylinder - if it was a slow kind of "grinding" or "buzzing"
sort of sound - if I'm guessing right, that was a "recalibrate". That
is a function the drive contains, for figuring out "where it is".
 When the drive seeks, it does a read to see what cylinder it is on.
 If the cylinder isn't the one it expected, which can be due to failing
seek mechanism, or due to loss of magnetism (can't read the required
header info once the seek is done) then it does a "recal" which is a
process like "Oops, I can't figure where I am, so I'd better very slowly
and carefully seek back out to track 0 (at which point a special sensor
says 'OK, you've gotten to track 0') at which time I can again seek
quickly to various cylinders".
 Actually the drive has NO idea of "absolute seeks" - it can NOT seek
say to track 123, but what it does is say "OK, lets see, I'm on track
83, so I have to step in 40 tracks to get to track 123", i.e. it always
seeks RELATIVE to its past position. Thus, if it ever gets lost, it
could have done a seek to 123 but arrive at 122 due to a hardware glitch,
so it has to slowly (since for all it knows, something could have gone
wrong and it could ACTUALLY be on track 2!) seek back until it finds
itself at 0, THEN quickly issue 123 "step in" commands.
 Spinrite helped because of reading a track's worth of data, then
low level formatting that track, then writing the info back. Backing up,
doing a low-level format, and restoring, would have done the job, too.
Spinrite is nice in that you don't "have" to back up and restore, though
you SHOULD have a backup "just in case".

Msg 46599 is 15 line(s) on 03/12/94 from EDWARD MARSH
to ALL re: JAPAN PART CROSS REF'S

I have a few parts that I am trying to cross reference from a japanese product.
 I called Tri-state and found that no cross matches could be found under the
part numbers I gave. I have no idea how to find such information and would
like it if anyone out there knows of such a reference. I have the following
parts:
 D571: transistor I think?
 C3457: Power MOS fet?, Regulator?,
 D1805: tansistor?

The D571 & D1805 are three terimal devices, and are in packages that I
have never seen. (not a TO-226). The case is more square that round.
The C3457 is in a TO-220 case (same as the 78xx regulator series case).
Any info anyone can offer would be appreciated.

Thank you!

to WARD/ALL re: ALZHEIMER'S AND OLD PCS

Thanks, Ward, for your clarification on what was going on in the
hard drives. SPINRITE has one advantage over the low-level reformating
done by other utilities: SPINRITE can also adjust the sector
interleave. Mine was already set to optimum (2:1), but my friend's
old ATT 6300 was reset to 7:1 (from 5:1) by SPINRITE, and the
throughput was increased to 112,000 bps (from 27,000 bps). The
improvement is quite noticeable. "Just because there's snow on the
roof, don't think there isn't fire in the furnace!" (For those
whippersnappers among us, "snow" refers to "white hair.")

From the Chicago TRIBUNE, March 6, 1994, Section 4, p. 3:
 "Some people who have bought computers, bedazzled with reports
about their possibilities, can't even get started. One computer
manufacturer told the Wall Street Jounal its help line gets 8,000
calls a day. A customer complained, for example, that her computer
wouldn't work even though she kept pushing her foot on the pedal.
She had to be told that you don't step on a mouse.
 "A man couldn't get his computer to fax a letter even though
he held it in front of the screen and repeatedly pushed the 'send'
button."
