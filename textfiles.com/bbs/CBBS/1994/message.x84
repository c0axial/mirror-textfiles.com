CHICAGO ONLINE,
I just received a flyer to join Chicago Online. It is apparently a Tribune
connected BBS. Anybody have any further information to share?

R/JUST DROPPING BY..,
Dear Sysuser:
  Sure, an ad for your BBS would be welcome.  Just leave out the "noise",
i.e. my preference is for no ***'s, ---'s, etc.  Just info. ;-)

TELNET/FTP ACCESS,@@@@
Can anyone inform me of any service LOCAL to the Chicago area
which provides TELNET or FTP access to the Internet? I have
a subscription to WORLD (Software Tool and Die) as well
as EMAIL capabilities, however, I would like off-prime TELNET if
possible.. Thanks in advance,
Jim Polous

R/WIERD PROBLEM SOLVED.,
  That (8000 as the # if reserved sectors or whatever it was) IS
very strange!  I should shoot you a copy of my DISKPARM program that
quickly dumps the disk parm block off of any floppy or hard disk:
DiskParm 9/10/88 by Ward Christensen
	Defaults to A: drive, or specify a drive:  DiskParm c:
00 02 01 01 00 02 E0 00 40 0B F0 09 00 12 00 02 00 00 00
~~~~~ ~~ ~~~~~ ~~ ~~~~~ ~~~~~ ~~ ~~~~~ ~~~~~ ~~~~~ ~~~~~
  512 bytes per sector
    1 sectors per cluster
    1 reserved sector
    2 copies of fat
  224 root entries
 2880 sectors per disk
   F0 media descriptor
    9 sectors per fat
   18 sectors per track
    2 heads
    0 hidden sectors
  Actually if there were an 8000 in hidden sectors or reserved sectors,
I don't know if it would say "32768" or not!  But the HEX part would have
shown you it anyway (I wrote it sort of as a tutorial, i.e. so you could
see the hex corresponding to the appropriate decimal values).

MODEM PROBLEMS,
Ward, have been having problems getting into CBBS recently. Last night
and again today. Not Compuserve, Ward Board, NOWAR...just CBBS. Seems
to answer OK then either never sync up, or the link is actually made but
the parameters aren't right. Changing the comm parameters on my end
interactively doesn't seem to help. I get garbage at 2400, 1200, 8, 7,
1, none, odd, even, etc. (I always come in at 2400, 8, 1, & none) Tonight
I got in without problems, but when I called back to leave this message
I had trouble. Could be my modem, but seems isolated to CBBS??!

MSC 7.0 & IBM C SET/2,
Any body have a handy converter to allow easy correlation of MSC 7.0
window functions to C Set/2? I'm looking for some kind of cross reference
between the two from hard copy. Migrating seems to be pretty mysterious
some times. Has such a document ever come to light? On a related topic,
anybody had any fun chasing undeclared extern's that pop into the error
log for C Set/2 compiles/links of migrated code that you thought would
compile without a hitch?
