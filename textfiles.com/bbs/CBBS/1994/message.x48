R/COLORADO TAPE DRIVES,
  I format them overnight - you might suggest the same.  Just start a format
before going home.  I think that's safer anyway because it ensures the tape
is exactly aligned with the drive.

WELCOMEK,
I dunno when yougot this thing back up, but THANKS.  CBBS was the
first board I ever called, I _think_ back in 1984 (it was in the dialing
directory of a copy of MDM something-or-other (CP/M) that a friend had
given me.  Helped me a lot in them days.

I'll try to come up with a good topic or two.  Right now, I'm playing around
with task switchers, though I don't know if that's a good topic or not.
ALSO, I'v gotten into mapping social-science data geographically.  I've
found some neat stuff!	Right now, I'm working with a cheap but good program
(EXPERT MAPS -- $10.00 or so), but I'd like to find something that works at
the COUNTY level for the US.  Has anybody seen such a critter?	I'd
like to be able to assign levels of a given variable to counties/groups
and look at the results in glorious VGA color, but can it be done for
less than $100??  That's probably the real question...

R/80287 COPROCESSOR PROBLEMS,
  It really DOES sound like your chip has a problem!  Try re-seating it,
maybe even check if you accidentally bent a pin under ('287s are a DIP
type chip, right?).
  No problem dropping by only when you have problems...  Just glad to have
you here at all ;-)

HELP,
  You asked for help on "last".  Sorry, that IS a logical keyword, but I'd
not put it in the help file.  The way you find your last call is that it
is symbolically called "*" for the high msg, or # for info on your last call.
  Thus you can do "r" then when asked for a msg #, you can reply *, and if
you just want to find statistics about your last call (date, time, hi msg
#) then use the "#" command.

R/TELCO QUESTION,NONO
  None of the *dial-in* phone lines at Chinet and CBBS have tone
(DTMF) dialing.

R/HP LASERJET4 & TRUETYPE,
Ward,
  Trutype can not be simply rasterized.  AS they are
scalable fonts, one would tell the lser which fiont and what
size to make it.  I don't think this person at HP knew
what they were talking about.  This wories me for another
reason:  I was told by a distributor that the HP4/M was
on an engineering hold and none were available
  I was told that this was not
true, but that several people had called with the sa,me
story from around the country.	I have the feeling
that she might have had all the wrong answers
