as to how the modem performs, reliability, and value.  Telebit has a
direct marketing program on and is asking $299.00 for the .  The
modem is V.32 compliant, etc.

R/CD ROMS,
The major reason for my interest in CD ROMs is that it appears that they
are going to become a mode (maybe dominant) of software distribution.
Borland is now offering their software on CD ROM. My concern for the
moment is what will become the standard format. Can CD players read
different formats through software changes, or will the formats be
integrated into the hardware?

OS2 BETA TESTERS,
Any OS2 32-Bit Graphics Engine beta testers out there? I'm one. Are you
one, too? If you are...'fess up, and we can trade lies and share the
thrills of reformatting large disk volumes for the sake of the jolly
blue giant, and personal curiosity, too, of course. Or, if you're not,
I'll still talk (sic) to you, anyhow.

HOWDY!,
  Long time no see!   You still active in CACHE?  I keep getting msgs
encouraging me to go, but just not enough time, and a bit too far away.
(I've settled on the club, (APCU) that meets at the U of Chicago,
as that is more "down in my area".

R/MODEM,
Hey (( light bulb lights )), I got an idea. I noticed the other day
on USENET that AT&T Paradyne was running a "sysop" program. I
wonder if they woudl be "interested" in "donating" a new modem to
the world's first BBS??
