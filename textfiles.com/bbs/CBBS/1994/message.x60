HEATHKIT DEAD?,
  Just heard that Heathkit is now gone!  Bummer!  Not that I've used 'em
much since the mid 70s, but still too bad.
  I once read something that to make a kit, they had to charge quite a bit
more than if they sold it built - to cover the engineering of the kit
building, warranty returns, etc.

R/HEATHKIT DEAD?,
Heathkit isn't gone yet... in fact order the catalog as a collectors
item. Yea... I got mine right next to me matter of fact. They even
sell Windows for DOS, can you believe it?

CACHE REUNION,
  Gee, sorry, didn't mean to not include you - just quick whipped up a
few names of folks I'd talked or who had been on CBBS recently.
  What do you think of the idea of a reunion?  Yours is the first comment
on it (and for those who are "reading over our shoulder" Steve wondered
if he was too late, and the answer is no, since I'd not heard from
anyone at all!
  P.S. nice to have you back!

INVIZOBOBBLE,
  If CBBS was not echoing what you were typing, then you probably were
"experimenting" by typing different things without knowing what they do,
or a line glitch or typo caused you to key the (now obsolete, but still
there) "D" command, which switches you into half-duplex, a mode whereby
YOUR TERMINAL program or modem echo characters so you don't want CBBS to
do so also.
  Sorry for the problems.  Stop back, jump in the conversations.  What
are you running, what are you "into"?

R/INTERNET VIA PUBNET?,
Thanks, David.	I'll give it a try.

R/KEYBOARDS,
Ward, you sure don't ask for much, do you?  I'd try calling the nice folks
at Lexmark.  I didn't think I liked them, at first.  You will recall how
much I liked the kb that came with my CompuAdd Express machine -- made by
BTC, very solid.  Well, I ordered another for my home machine, and got
a Lexmark keyboard instead.  It seems the Express folks switched sources
because Lexmark is trying to get into the businss bigtime (cheap).  Anyway,
the feel is nice (about like an IBM, but quieter).  It's rubber dome or
somesuch, with a nice feel.  Well-laid out, a nice long (straight/flat)
cable, and fairly light, but with a solid feel.

The one thing it lacks is your (and my) choice of control key, and of cours
it has no switch.  But Lexmark is advertising for the retail market these
days, and may have something more to your liking.

To be honest, I think that I've finally gotten used to the lower-left
control key.  I have a program to switch things on my work machine, but
I seldom use it.  Just like I got used to the F-keys across the top -- but
then I have large hands, which may have made the switch easier.

The only thing I can't get used to is GUIs.  Maybe if I had a touch-
screen they'd make sense.  Right now, I'm in the process of paring
down a Windows 3.0 installation so I can run the occasional bit of
software without 5 MB of junk.	OS/2 sounds pretty good, though.  Have you
taken a look at 4OS/2?	It's from the same folks who make 4DOS, whic
is a MUST for DOS.

DUAL IDE DRIVES,
  Well, today wasn't a good day - and not only because of the sore throat,
but because of the frustration of dual IDE drives.
  I got a new WD Caviar 200M to replace my 120M Seagate ST1144.
  What I wanted to do was put both in the system, with the WD as master,
so I could later remove the Seagate, and move it to another system whose
old MFM drive/controller failed.
  Do you put on the "master" jumper on the master, and the "slave" jumper
on the slave?  No!  In spite of the ST1144 having a "master" jumper
originally, it turns out (no docs came with drive!) that "slave" means
"Slave PRESENT" and is only to be used when the drive is a MASTER!
  SO the "master" jumper on the WD was what worked with both, and after
moving things over, I had to remove THAT to allow the drive to work alone.
  Randy's suggestion of leaving both drives OUT OF THE CASE until the
problems were solved, was a good one!

R/CLONE AND DRDOS,
Thanks Andy!
