Msg 46602 is 07 line(s) on 03/15/94 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/"(I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP)"

There's a (probably apocryphal) story about the support person who
guessed that the user hadn't closed the door on a disk drive and asked
the user to close the door. The user said "hold on" and a moment later
the support person heard the sound of a room door closing in the background.

About a month ago I received a letter requesting a demo copy of a program
I sell. It stated, verbatim, "I need it on the 3 1/4 inch hard dick."

Msg 46603 is 03 line(s) on 03/17/94 from STEVE RYAN
to EDWARD MARSH re: R/JAPAN PART CROSS REF'S

ECG book if I can find it.
