 It can be a bear hooking lots of SCSI devices. I spent 5 days getting
a CD ROM, hard disk, and DAT tape drive. Has to do with "ASPI" drivers,
that seems to tie things together.
 Have you found a scanner that is SCSI? I had heard of them, but have
no experience with trying to get 'em going with other devices. I'd
suggest talking to the scanner mfgr, they should know.

 Well, I got a call from Jack Rickard, "What will it take to get you
to come to One BBS Con?" and I'll have to call him back and see what
kind of an offer he's willing to make. ACTUALLY, I might be able to
stay with friends, AND the airfare is only like $110 last time I checked.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: SCSI DEVICES

Ward:
 I have a HP Scanner that has its own SCSI adapter. I had read at
one time about the reason that you could not hook up a scanner to an adapter
adapter card that has disk drives connected. I was just wondering if you
had read something similar. There was another BBS that had an inquiry
on this subject and I responded. The person is looking for more info
than I presently have on hand. I was going to try and hook up my
scanner to the SCSI adapter but quit because of waht I had read about
the device types and something that it may change with the next SCSI
specification or maybe SCSI-3. ???????

I'll be running the ASP both at the show and probably giving a couple
of the presentations at the SSS part of the show. If you are going and
don't have hotel reservations you better book quickly.

Last I heard ONE BBS was *paying* speakers and special guests to attend.
You should be able to get at least airfare, hotel, meals, conference
registration, plus a bit of cash. <g> I paid $172 for round trip airfare
to Atlanta.
