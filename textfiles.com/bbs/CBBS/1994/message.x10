HP PAINTJET XL300 PS,FROG
   Anyone have any comments as to how the HP PaintJet XL300 with
Postscript performs, on reliability, and $$ value is.  The images that
are printed are they better than the PCL5C mode?

MUSTANG II PS BOARD,FROG
     Anyone used the Mustang II postscript board for the HP LJ III
printer?  The board has 4Meg of memory and allows postscript file output
to be printed by the HP LJ III.  The board also allows another PC to be
connected to the printer using the existing parallel port.  The board
is able to switch from PCL5C and postscript automatically.  Any and
all comments are welcome.

PRINTER SHARING,
How about an A/B switch box (manual) at the printer, and a cable booster
on Mr. X's machine if it's more than 15 feet or so from the printer.  Ideally,
locate the switch box at the printer, not at Mr. X's desk.

If you go to an auto-switching unit, you may have some hassles you haven't
anticipated, like either having different people's outputs interleaved,
or else long timeouts to prevent that.	You don't want hassles like A
downloading some soft fonts, printing a document, B then downloading his
soft fonts and printing, then A coming back and printing on the assumption
that his soft fonts are still there.

R/REPLY RE: CBBS,
Hmm, I guess I'm creating a chain here...Ward's right.	It'll be a LONG
time before most pople have terminals/computers/modems at home.  Some
of us (with income) are fortunate, but many people with access to
computers (i.e., $) are still up a crick because they don't know what
to do if it ain't on the menu.	I was lucky.  Back in '84 I got to be
elected computer person at the American Bar Foundation because (1) I
used to be a ham operator, and everyone though that==hacker in those
days, and (2) I had bought a Kaypro 2 in hopes of gettig some writing
done.  I was lucky enough to be given a copy of MDM7xxx that had the
CBBS number in the dialing directory, and I've been a faithful
follower of CBBS for about 8 years now.  BUT.  Most people don't
feel comfortable with mahines, BBSs, etc.  It's funny -- everyone will
tell you that driving a car is easy; everyone tells you the opposite about
computers.  Yet the latter are in many ways easier (and less risky to
master).  So -- even among the well-endowed, there's a long way to go.
If you're on the street, or make less than $15,000 a year (like many
people) you're probably out of it.  Heck, a good number of the people I
know here in upstate NY don't even have PHONES, let alone modems!!

SEE MSG 45910,
  I think that msg (45910) was intended for you.  He replied to ME,
but I was replying to YOUR note in the COMMENTS - users can't "reply
to a comment" only to a msg....

PROBLEMS WITH PKZIP 2.04C,
The new PKzip/unzip is indeed real, but it has at least 3 identified problems:

1)  QDPMI.SYS v1.00, the Quarterdeck DOS Protected Mode Interface, will not get
along with either pkzip or pkunzip. This can be worked around with a SET
PKUNZIP=-) and a statement in the file PKZIP.CFG that reads DPMI=disable.  If
you do NOT do this, both PKzip and PKunzip will reboot your system!

2)  PKZip 2.04c will allocate a 16k UMB and will NOT give it back when it is
done executing.  This is especially troublesome for those who process outside
DESQview and then start the bbs, or those who do not use DESQview.  The UMB is
allocated in the middle of the largest available continous block.

3)  Related to 2), the statement XMS=disable or XMS=off is completely ignored,
so that cannot be used to work around it, and can also cause other problems.
The commandline switch -- does work, but not every program that calls PKzip can
have the commandline configured.

MODEM,
I just got this new modem, a PPI14400, and it does seem to have
problems connecting to some modems. What type of modem is CBBS
running on these days, a USR maybe ? That seems to be the most
difficult for the PPI to connect to, but I really don't have
enought data yet to come to any  "real" conclusions. If I'm able
to come to some answers that may be of use, I'll pass them on.
