LAPTOP FOR SALE,OPIE
I have a Zenith laptop for sale or trade. This is the 184 series,
8088, 640k, CGA compatible graphics, 20m hard drive and 720k floppy,
1200 baud internal modem.

It is in excellent shape, with a new hard drive and controller card,
and new battery pack.

It operates on internal batteries or 12vdc, making it an excellent packet
rig. Includes soft case, power supply, and battery pack.

I figure it's value to be about $500 or so. It would not be so much except
that all the critical parts are new.

I am looking to sell it outright (preferrably) or to trade it for an
HF rig of some sort. The rig must be 12vdc, can be a QRP rig such
as the Ten-Tec Century 22 or Heath HW9 series (with a little cash or ??
thrown in) or a low end HF rig such as the 747GX, 725, 730 or so.

If are interested in a purchase or trade, I can be reached at
708-632-8723 or at N9IFG@W9ZMR.IL.USA.NA. Thanks es 73, Joe... .-.

R/QUESTION ON GUEST ACCESS,
  Sorry, Randy doesn't call in here any more (compared to chinet, it
is "boring").
  I don't THINK any non-contributor has access to the internet, but I'll
pass your msg along to him when I call chinet this evening.

9600 BAUD,
  I know it isn't all that fast (because of local echoing of the screen)
but is 9600 working OK for you?  At CBBS' 12th or so anniversary, USR gave
me two HST 9600s, one for CBBS, one for me.  Randy "usurped" one when
CBBS died, and I had to give mine up to get CBBS going again, so I can
no longer get in over 2400, and am just wondering if it is OK.
  Thanks!

INTERVIEW,
Tell me more about the "research", please.  Ask a few questions, I'll
respond online.  Kind of burned out on the interview process, what with
having invented BBSs (and coined the term "BBS").  I DO presume you know
this is the worlds first BBS, about to celebrate its 15th anniversary
in February.
  What is your research for?  A write-up?  A magazine?	Club newsletter?
Where is 203?

R/MSC 7.0 & IBM C SET/2,
No, I was referring to use of equivalent calls in each of the two systems,
MSC SDK, and IBM C Set/2. There seems to be similarity, as one would
expect, but still lots of naming difference to keep us busy. Not calls
for Windows, but window calls as in window function calls, handles,
creates, messages, etc. I have the SDK also, and have found some of
Microsoft's sample programs to be more functionally complete than IBM's.
