 The articles in - I forget - PC Week or PC Mag, I believe showed
Gateway as having 100% or even OVER, return rate, the first year. I was
just at a customer who talked their company into STOPPING dealing with
Gateway - they get different motherboards in the same shipment of
identical models, etc. They lost their warehouse server - a Gateway.
They're now looking at IBM. More expensive, but significantly higher
quality.
 I also know some people who are very happy with their Gateways.

 I heard from larry435@aol.com that he had forwarded your message on
to "the powers that be" or something like that, and he was asking ME
if I'd heard from YOU as to whether they'd contacted you yet. So,
no news.

to KEVIN PRECHT re: R/ASKING ABOUT GATEWAY COMPUTE

I am using a Gateway 2000 486/33Mhz. I like it alot. The support is excellent.
They are getting very popular and it can be a pain to get someone to talk to.
But, they keep long hours 6:00 a.m. to midnight and all numbers are toll free.
I have 2 WD drives. They are very good. I measured ave. seek times between
11 and 13 ms. I think Gateway 2000 gives the most bang for the buck on new
systems. Also, they are very reasonable on software and hardware upgrades.

Are looking looking for ISA or MC cards ????

Msg 46590 is 07 line(s) on 03/05/94 from PHIL SCHUMAN
to WARD re: IBM MANUALS FOR 4700/4600

I friend is looking for some manuals on the 4700 and 4600 systems.
these I think are the grocery and teller terminal systems.
I would add these to my SLSS - but he wants to get an order for a class
he is presenting. The library downtown is long gone for ordering and I
don't know where to call for an outsider to call, order and try and use a
credit card or send a check like the old 7th (?) floor did.
Any ideas ?
