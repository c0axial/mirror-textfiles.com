R/HELLO FROM RUSSIA,
Hi, Ward! Great to hear from you! You are very famous in my country -
phone lines are poor, we have to use protocols very wide . So, your
protocol is taught at every computer science college we have.
Many thanks for your comments, appreciate it.
Since I'm running BBS, I'd appreciate if you'd write a few words to my
users . We'd like to hear your ideas about BBS history and evolution,
future. What business are you in now, what plans do you have, what do you think
about changes in our country...
I know, I ask a lot - but hope you'd find some time to answer.
Hope to hear, Arcady Khotin.
Software developer, President of Clipper Users Group in St.Petersburg.

GOOF-PROOFING SYSTEMS,
   I'm trying to make the systems at my local library as cracker-proof as
I can manage.  One idea I've had is to make the systems unreadable by most
all software, by munging the partition tables of the hard drives and forcing
the use of a floppy to get the system on-line; of course, in order to get
the system running, the person would have to enter a valid SLS Inter-library
code.
   I'm open to any and all ideas.  To express a few initial ideas of my own,
I've thought about forcing the use of a specially-formatted floppy to gett
the hard drive on-line, and to load a device driver which would prevent
hard drive access without proper authorization.  Etc. Etc.
   The long and short of it is, I'd like to have them be able to loan their
computers to people with confidence that they won't end up with several
directories full of data deleted, the operating system removed from the HD,
etc.
   ANY and ALL ideas are DEFINITELY appreciated.

R/PC MAINTENANCE PRICING,
I've been using both Memorex Telex and IBM domestically.  However, as the
Qty. of PCs contine to increase, my maintenance budget has gone thru the
ceiling. As a result, I'm looking for other alternatives.....

KEYBOARDS AGAIN,
Ward, try NORTHGATE.  They have a 101-key keyboard that fits your specs
and ALL of their keyboards have a bank of switches that allow things
like custom placement of the control key.  I think they sell for around
$100 or so, and they have a nice touch -- a lot like the original
PC keyboard.  If you really need what you asked for, that's the way to get
it.
