]Boys, boys. How the heck have y'all been? I'm fine, thanks for asking.
But a little reticent about calling since the collapse of the Logopolis
CBBS hardware. It was a sad day, letting a CBBS system die after all
those years. But it was a case where the new sysop on site did NOT
work out. Oh well, on to other things, eh? Laterness...

to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/AD OK?

Sure. Just follow the usual "CBBS practices" - like no centered lines,
etc (tee hee).

Msg 42027 is 05 line(s) on 07/07/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to RICK SURWILO re: R/FILE COMPRESSION

Well, Zoo has source available (not sure where, but the author indicates it
is available), and it's been implemented on Unix. Not considered the
most optimal compression method, but.For that matter, the source code to
earlier versions of ARC is available, but few people would be willing
to touch that one with a ten-foot pole.

Msg 42028 is 07 line(s) on 07/07/89 from STEVE BOGOLUB
to ALL re: APPLE MM/E SCHEMATIC?

If anyone has a schematic diagram for an Apple /e-based Hayes Micromodem
IIe laying around from ancient days, I'd like to arrange a copy. I've got
such a modem in a state where it does everything right except establish a
carrier. (sounds like the signal is too weak) I'd like to take a stab at
fixing it, as a friend has a use for it, but it's one of those cases where
it's not worth "professional" service, even if such was available. A return
message here would start the ball rolling.

Msg 42029 is 02 line(s) on 07/07/89 from BENJAMIN COHEN
to ALL re: PRINTER FOR SALE

I have an IDS Microprism 480 dot matrix printer for sale, with
manual. 120 cps, parallel, push tractor. Call 726-3555 days.

to ALL re: BUNKER-RAMO ALLADIN SYSTEM

If anyone can help, I need information on a Bunker-Ramo "Alladin System"
used in Banks. I am specifically looking for protocol and format
information. If you can help, please call me. My work number is 629-5777,
and home is 690-3770. My BBS can be reached at 690-3808. Thanks.

z{Hi! Are you the author of a great piece of shareware?
If so, we would love to hear from you. Argus
Computerized Exchange is an online system located in
Burlington, Mass. Our number is (617)229-2345.
We believe that quality, disease-free shareware is
what people really want. That's why we are asking
you to give us a call and upload the most recent

easy as leaving an email message to the SYSOP,
then attaching the file to it! Or, if you would
prefer, you may send a copy on diskette to the
following address:
