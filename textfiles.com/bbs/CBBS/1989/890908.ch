Ted,
 I have tried Prodigy for just a week and find it pretty good for the
money. For the E-mail alone it is worth it. I think that the most
important thing is that it is well written for the novice. That makes
it too "menu-ey" for the advanced comm person, but I think it is still
useful. Why not try it again and look in on the Computer Club-Jump
"Computer Club". Brent

Ward,
 I really appreciate the comment my "airing" a private letter, I won't do
it again. I didn't realize that it was a sensitive thing. Though I got the
critical mail via EasyPlex, I didn't even think of privacy and forgot
about the little (P).
 I did reply, biting by tongue so that I wouldn't be as caustic as my
critic. I explained that I didn't see CIS and Prodigy as competition.
And each time I use either I am more convinced of this.
 Try using the Prodigy Directory and from it do an e-mail. It is so well
done! Whoever wrote the e-mail sections of Prodigy sure deserves a lot
of credit, it is simple and it works very well.

 I wish that I could see all the lovely colors on Prodigy too. But I am
seeing CGA on my Toshiba-and it is often very hard to read the screen-
kind of fuz on fuz. I asked the experts, who suggested Hercules! but of
course that was nonsense. I even tried MCGA-which I had never heard of-
but it was no good either. Have you tried using your laptop-is it a
Zenith?
 Say you want to do something really useful? Tell me how to dump a
Prodigy "PRINT" to disk rather than to my printer. Will some little DOS
command do it? Could you write a tiny little program (TRS) that I could
pop up and say "Redirect to disk"? I realize that the graphic screens of
info are not ASCII in the first place. I only want to put my e-mail on
disk.
 Also can you have a look at the front end of Prodigy (ie where you put
in the user id and password and see if Prodigy could ever be accessed w/o
their own software? Maybe that is a no-no. I suspect that some sort of
special code is sent during the log on. And that this wouldn't be
duplicatable (what kind of work is that!). The idea of sending graphics
rather than text makes me feel that Prodigy will never be "open" in the
sense of different comm software like CIS and the other BBS are.
 And the speed will continue to be a problem, unless we get fiber optics
to all homes in the next few years.

Prodigy is a new IBM/Sears service for computers. It is somewhat
like a BBS in that you can send/receive messages. But it is graphics
based and commercial. I suppose that it falls in the area of VideoText,
but because it uses PC's it is a bit smarter than all those other
VideoText failures of the past 10 years (they were dumb terminals usually)
 I think that right now it is available only the IBM PC users but an
Apple II and Mac version is coming. You can get a kit with $30 on-line
credit for $40 from Sears stores-should call them first.
 One phone number in 312 area code is 437-0213, there are others.
 I think that the News, Weather, E-mail, travel service and games are
pretty well done on Prodigy. The very best thing is the cost-hold
on to your hat-$9.95 PER MONTH, UNLIMITED USE! Even with all the little
graphics ads on the bottom of the screen I think that it is worth it.
Would you believe that Sears has K-Mart, PC Penney and Speigel ads on
THEIR service? You can even order groceries and pizza. Try to do
that on CompuServe or GEnie or even CBBS!
 The initial kit price is refundable in 30 days if you don't like the
service.

to ALL re: LIKE PRODIGY???

Hmm. Prodigy sounds just like the same thing as PC-LINK. This requires
differnt menus and only works with a special software (needs 384K) and
displays graphics and all. The makers of PC-LINK has versions for the Apple
(Apple-LINK) and Commodore (Q-LINK needs 64K) computers too. But they are
not linked together. Bad news if you use more than one type of computer. My
understanding is that Q-LINK is the most popular. Probably because it was
out about three to four years before the other versions.

I also use CIS, GEine and The Source (which was discontinued) and they all
support your favorite communication program. Which is nice for sure. But
those graphic communication programs like Prodigy and PC-LINK adds some
spice to plain ASCII. But they usually lack powerful features that your
favorite term has. If you can live with the lack of features with graphic
systems offer, then I believe you are all set.

PC-LINK has a $9.95 monthly fee. Same for Q-LINK too. Does Prodigy have the
same cost? Q-LINK has some features you can use 13 hours a day for the same
$9.95 charge per month. If you use them, what a deal. 31 days at 13 hours
equals to 403 hours at a cost of two an a half cents per hour. But I doubt
that you can stay up at night and log-on all that time??? But you can have
fun trying!

 Thanks anyway.

Prodigy is $9.95 per month ($40 for the initial kit and 3 months usage).
It comes with the special graphics software, but it is much more
impressive than PC-Link, or Q-Link (both of which someone in the house
subscribes to). You can be on Prodigy as long as you want and do anything
that you want on there without incurring any additional charges. The best
part is that they seem to be aware of the telephone company's billing
system and have installed several lines with local phone numbers for
various communities. The number that I call is an Oak Lawn number
which is great, since that's where I live. The only thing "wrong" with
Prodigy is that they do not have any file transfer forums yet, although
they aref* {orking on it. I see features that are not available
for this geographic area, on-line grocery shopping, on-line computer
banking. They want to have a bank in every major service area on the
system. I'm waiting for something like that for me in this area, I will
probably switch my money market and checking accounts over to that
bank, but that's a whole other story.
