to KEVIN KEYSER re: R/NEED COMPUTER

Yes Kevin, I know. I tried to talk him into one. But he wants to just
get his computer fixed. I told him also instead of just pouring money
into the one he has, just buy a used Kaypro for the same price as get-
ting his old one fixed. But he would listen, because he said he really
likes his Kaypro II. He never had another computer before. I did led
him my Compaq 286 once though.

I too have found the Commodore 128 a great CP/M computer. Did you know
in the operating system can store 10 different CP/M formats plus it's
own? It has 5 preprogrammed and you can add 5 more or change to a new
10 set. See the Public Domain program called "UNIDRIVE128" for more
details. You have to BOOT with a Commodore format CP/M, but after that
any format that you would like to use after that. Mix and match if you
like. Add half a Meg for $150.00 to $200.00 and just plug it in like
a power cord (no opening the case to the computer to void the warranty)
here. What could be simplier?

Many people think that MS-DOS has the largest software base. Which in
itself is true. But the Commodore 128 can run CP/M, C64, C128, and
GEOS operating systems and when added together, makes the C128 capable
of running more software than any other computer ever.

The CP/M is one of the most powerful versions I have ever seen. The
ability to use the E: drive to make use of one drive system to look
like two, is rare in the CP/M world. It works in MS-DOS, only if you
really do have one drive.

Commodore was also very smart to make their disk drives programmable.
It has the same micro used in Apples. If you give the C= drives a key-
board and video chip, you have another computer.

to JERRY OLSEN re: R/NEED COMPUTER

Boy, thanks for all the info! You did just fine. It answered all my
questions, better than I had hoped for! I am glad that dBase will work on
MS-DOS machines. As I do use MS-DOS, but not dBase. Just on my CP/M
computers. Although there is dBase on the MS-DOS on the hard disk, I've
never used it. But I don't think I'll let it sit forever without use.

My friend seems not to be to favorable of the idea of buying another
computer, instead of not repairing his. He has used it about 6 years every
day. And I think that he will be throwing money away, if he gets it fixed.

The problem with his computer, is that, let's say he is running WordStar.
It works fine for a while, then he gets BIOS errors. It seems that either
drive does it. But if CONTROL/TAB is pushed. The program continues. More
BIOS errors pop up, but C/T continues to work. The KX command seems to
destroyes the file, but KD works. When it acts up a lot. You even get BIOS
errors on boot. But C/T works again too.

Is there a way to boot off the "B" drive on a Kaypro II, instead of the "A"
drive? You can on a lot of other different computers, CP/M and MS-DOS types.

BTW, my home number is 777-2067 if you want to chat. later <BW>

to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/IEEE-484

Thank's for the info about the pin-outs of the IEEE-488. I knew that, but
if I didn't, I would have had a hard time. I have a magazine that states
that the manual for the Osborne Executive is even wrong. So they give the
correct wirinH. I would like to buy one made up, but I can make my own if I
can find that odd IEEE-488 plug. I may have to change the one on the
Osborne to get it to work.

My friend isn't interested in a Kaypro 10. But I like to learn new things.
How big is the hard disk on a Kaypro 10? What does it run for a used one?
Thanks, chat later <BW>.

to ALL re: CROSSTALK VERSION 3.0

Does anybody know of any patches to CrossTalk for CP/M? How about a
patch for using it on a Commodore 128? I am using it now on my Osborne
Computer.

One feature is really nice is it will add a space if you are dumping
text to the modem and the line contains just a return character.

It about as hard to learn as dBase, MEX, and WordStar. But all these
programs are easy once you learn them.

Anybody else here use CrossTalk?

to ERIC BOHLMAN re: CCBS AND THINGS.

Hello Eric;

Hey; I noticed that you are on a lot of BBS's. One that really caught
my eye was on CCBS. Did you have a Commodore? Did you work with Mike
setting up that board? Is Mike still alive somewhere? What kind of
computer is that board running on? It states it is on ROM.

Well I gotta go, nice chatting with you again, bye. <BW>

Msg 41834 is 07 line(s) on 05/21/89 from BILL WOLFF
to ALL re: LINE NOISE???

I have asked this before, but I havn't gotten a reply. I have a lot of
trouble on this board and another with line noise. But the others I
have no problem. 300 baud works, but 1200 and 2400 is ruff.

Does any one else have this problem? I have used two different
computers and modems, same thing. I am an experienced user, so I don't
think it is my fault.

to ALL re: DISK DOCTOR

Has anybody got 'DISK DOCTOR' version 1.40 by SuperSoft Inc. to
work on anything besides a Osborne 1? I have tried it both on a
Osborne Executive and a Commodore 128. I never exspected it to
work on the Commodore. But you never know? The manual describes
how to run it on the OCC 1 (Osborne 1). Any ideas?

Oh yea, my copy says 'QC SAMPLE' on it. Quality Control Sample? I
did buy it in a computer surplus store in San Jose, California.

Msg 41836 is 06 line(s) on 05/21/89 from BILL WOLFF
to ALL re: BASCOM AND THANKS!

Thanks to everyone who helped me through the BASCOM not running on
anything but a Osborne 1. I got the patch (it's real short) to get
it to work on other computers. If anyone cares, it's three to seven
times faster than MBASIC. EBASIC runs the same as MBASIC semi-
compiled. Does anyone use EBASIC any more? Never used CBASIC. Is
it any faster? Thanks all!

Msg 41838 is 07 line(s) on 05/22/89 from PAUL STREETER
to BILL WOLFF re: R/ XTALK R/ LINE NOISE

I used Crosstalk XVI for a long time; it was bundled with my Ventel modem.
I now have a USR sportster 2400, and "traded in" Xtalk XVI for XTALK MARKIV.
I doubt that this will help you much. I also get line noise often on CBBS
but not often on SYSLINK, the only other system I use. I assume the problem
is usually in my line. If it happens a lot, and if you also hear noise
while talking to someone, complain to Daughter Bell. (Ma Bell, R.I.P.)
If the oise is consistent, they may be able to find and fix it.

to BILL WOLFF re: R/IEEE-484

1) The Kaypro 10 has a 10-meg HD. Used they range from $250-$300 (though
there will always be people asking $600 or more).
2) I have a Commodore 128, though I haven't used it a great deal in
the last year or so. I did manage to write a terminal program for
it, as well as adapt some stuff (mostly cross-assemblers) that I had
written for the 64.
3) I believe that CCBS runs on an 8000-series machine.
4) I suspect that it would be hard to patch Crosstalk for the 128 because
of the way that machine implements serial I/O in software. You cn't
just tell it what location to check to read/write a character and to
read status. Programs like MEX and IMP can deal with it because they
relay on an overlay or insert to handle all the I/O stuff.

Msg 41842 is 26 line(s) on 05/24/89 from JERRY OLSEN
to BILL WOLFF re: R/VARIOUS MSGS

For a number of reasons, your friend <really> should pick up another
machine, including the simple fact that repair <will> cost more than
replacement. If he wants to stick with CP/M Kaypros, he can easily find
a used Kaypro 4 for perhaps $100 or so.The problems you outline indicate
that a repair person probably would just replace the main board-if one can
be found. (The factory doesn't have them, so the repair person would have
to scrounge around.effectively charging for the price of a KII <and>
perhaps $50/hr.) But if your friend still insists, I can dig up the phone
number of a fellow who would work for a reasonable price, though it also
would involve UPS charges. I know if I ever were crazy enough to invest
$ in an old KII still sitting on the shelf here, I'd have serious doubts
whether it would make it across the country intact, though. The kind of
problems you outline can be expected to get progressively worse over time,
so it certainly would make sense for him to make plans now rather than be
without equipment for a time. There just aren't any "drop in" CP/M Kaypro
repair shops to be found anymore.

No, there isn't any practical way to boot off of the B: drive, though he
certainly could build a boot-up submit command which would always log drive
B: after a cold boot, though I wouldn't recommend it. Easy enough, but.

Line noise seems to be more common here (esp. at 2400) than some other
boards. Best bet is to use a term program which allows the filtering out of
selective characters (the ones giving you the most frequent problem).

Good luck.

to JERRY OLSEN re: R/VARIOUS MSGS

Yep, I wish he would just buy a used one. If he doesn't oh well.

Filtering certain characters for the line noise problem? Yep,
CrossTalk let's me do just that. But the line noise just ussually bump
the character to just one higher. Tough to filter that huh?

No keyboard short-cut for booting off of the "B" drive. If I work on
his, can I just swap connectors inside to do the same thing? I want to
prove the "A" drive isn't a problem by not using it. Any ideas?

I don't know if this was ever noted before. If so, please forgive the
retype. But playing around I found out that a OSBORNE EXECUTIVE can
boot off the B: drive by CTRL-TAB. Also pressing "T" instead of the
above, places the computer in a test loop forever. <BW>
