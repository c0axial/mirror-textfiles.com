Msgs 16-on have info on other Chicago area BBSs. The list is kind of old,
but you should find what you need.

to BOB SULLIVAN re: R/VIRUS PROBLEM SOLVED?

Yep, I always liked battery operated RAM as a operating system
too. Disconnecting the write enable is a easy thing to do with a switch
too. Also a good idea is a EEPROM. You can write on it like RAM, but it
remebers without power. So it is like a ROM that can be written to. The
bad news is that it can be only changed about 10,000 times. But no one
I know changed OS 10,000 times. Do you know anyone?

Thanks very much for trying but I'm pretty sure that I read about it.

HELLO EVERYBODY OUT THERE! I am a novice who is just learning the ropes
and need help. If anyone knows of any BBS'S in the Indianapolis area
I would greatly appreciated the information . Thanks!

Ward:

Just thought I would let you know about a possible problem. When I try
to connect at MNP (class 5) the my system will connect, but then it will
just die. I will hit CR multiple times (as usual) but never get any
response. When I try with MNP disabled, I have no problems at all. Wierd.

BTW: I'm using an ATI 2400etc modem connected to a PC Clone.

Reguards.
