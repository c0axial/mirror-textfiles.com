Msg 41792 is 09 line(s) on 05/07/89 from BILL COLEMAN
to ALL re: FOXBASE+ VS DBXL

I need to write several multiple file database applications which will
be run (mostly) by computer ignorant end users. The jobs are non-trivial
but not huge or terribly complicated. I have pretty much narrowed the
choice of development tools to these two. I can and have written decent
code but my time and interest is finite so I'm interested in (1) Ease of
use on my part above all (2) Compatibility with other other programs,
especially re accounting data, and (3) Performance. in this order.
Can anyone compare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of these
two programs for me? I'd appreciate it.
