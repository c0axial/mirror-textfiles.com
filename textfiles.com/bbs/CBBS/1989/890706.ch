with a name something like CBBSmmyy (Chicago BBS, month-year e.g.
when I first learned of it, it was CBBS0489). It will be a zip or arc.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: STATE OF BBS'S TODAY

Ward...I am trying to finish up a magazine article (free-lance) on the state
of BBSing today...particularly the problems which system operators now face-
from viruses corrupting programs, from law enforcement which seems to be
looking at the BBS as the harbor of illegal activity and cases you may have
been following where telephone and long distance companies have lashed out
against legitimate BBS systems.
   (One example:  in Oklahoma and Texas, the local phone company is trying
to charge BBS operators the expensive business line monthly fee regardless
of whether the BBS is commercial or not...closer to home, Telcom USA, a
long distance provider, recently prevented its customers from connecting
with the Protecto/Computer Direct BBS in Chicago because it found that
some of those suspected of gaining illegal long distance usage were
calling the Protecto/Computer Direct board.

   Specifically, what I would like from you...as the "father" of the BBS
system...are we finally in an era where it is going to be impractical or
impossible for the hobbyist to operate a BBS?  Are there so many problems
inherent in the telecom community that you would advise against starting a
BBS system?

   If you could answer these questions and give me what you feel is the
future of BBSing I would appreciate it!
  Thanks,
  Gary Barrett

Msg 42008 is 14 line(s) on 07/03/89 from JERRY OLSEN
to PETE RETZBACH re: R/TERMINAL HELP

It sounds as though the most likely source of your problem is miscommunication
between modem and software in terms of the TYPE of codes they're sending
to each other. I'll assume for the moment that your modem is a true "Hayes
compatible" and the Procomm is set to expect that. If so, remember that
"Hayes" modems can be configured to send either NUMERIC or "English" codes.
If your modem is sending and expecting one but Procomm is set for the other,
such things as recognizing carrier simply won't work. If you're not sure that
the software and modem are "speaking the same language," I'd suggest a
careful look at your modem literature to see how to set up the hardware for
numeric codes and try that. If there still are problems, take a good look
at Procomm's documentation involving modem installation. Quite a few
settings are involved, but just ensure your curent settings (which you can
determine by using the ALT-S menu, then select "modem options" submenu)
match what's expected by your modem, per its manual. Good luck.

Msg 42009 is 21 line(s) on 07/03/89 from JERRY OLSEN
to WARD re: MISC STUFF.

This is my first call since CBBS was back up. Unless I missed a log-on
bulletin, here's a temporary problem I encountered which wasn't mentioned
in any new msgs which I was able to find....Doing "R;*;+" found no new
msgs. Also, though the first new msg (as far as I can tell) was 42000,
Doing "Q;42000" yielded no new msgs. However, after about a dozen trial-and-
error guesses with "R;<num>;+" (substituting <num> with various numbers) I
eventually found 8 or so new msgs. Where <num> was a number prior to 42000
no new msgs popped up. Where <num> was greater than 42009 missed all new
msgs too (being too high). But I eventually locked into all (?) of the new
msgs....Seems the index between "precrash" and "postcrash" msgs couldn't make
the leap. I suspect, though, that my user record should point past the
problem area next time....Sorry to hear of the problems over this way,
which Alex Z. kindly advised folks over on my board early on.

BTW, prior to the crash you'd kindly offered a couple of DTP files for my
examination of their structure. I dunno if you've gotten to them, if they
(and possibly a msg about them) were trashed along with other stuff or you
just haven't had time. Again, no rush; but if the offer still stands, the
files would continue to be useful.

Kind regards.

Msg 42010 is 13 line(s) on 07/03/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to GARY BARRETT re: R/STATE OF BBS'S TODAY

Well, Randy Suess and I may have invented BBSs, but were never into file
transfers that much - the only file transfers supported by any board I've
run were many years ago in an attempt to run a CP/M Users group "by BBS".
  It is not clear what to do - I would surely promote shutting down the
"pirate boards" and confiscating the hardware - if not also fining the
operator.  Perhaps we should look at it like we look at voice telephones-
the positive aspects so far outweigh the negative ones, the we aren't about
to stop using voice phones, are we?
  As to paying business rates, that WOULD slow down a lot of BBSs - they
would have to become "subscription" boards, and that limits access,
especially to new users.  With telephone companies already extracting
units, LD charges and other fees from users of BBSs, it seems unnecessary
to add the burden of being a business line.

Msg 42011 is 12 line(s) on 07/03/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JERRY OLSEN re: R/MISC STUFF.

I dunno what to say.  There could be a bug in the summary file, but
I am unable to reproduce your problem.  The summary commands all work
just fine, including r;*;+, etc.  The only thing I can think is that I
skipped the msg #'s up to 42000, because I wasn't sure how many msgs
had been entered since my last capture, and I didn't want to re-use
any msg #'s that would confuse users.  Sounds like skipping also confused.
  If you do an o;-100 you'll see it kick right in.  o;-60 still finds
some of the older msgs.  The -100 is not "100 active messages", but
rather just subtracts 100 from the current "next" msg # and starts
the summary there.
  No, haven't gotten to the DTP file yet - but am on vacation for a couple
weeks so should have time to get to it!

to WARD re: RESTORE COMMAND

Do you know what the RESTORE command is telling me when it stops with a
beep (goes to a C>) near the end of the 11th diskette of 15? I said
near the end because I looked at the other dataset with NORTON UTILITY,
and it showed 2 more datasets on the diskette. (I am hoping that I
interpreted it reasonably correctly.) I could not find any
explanation in the PCDOS manual. OS 3.3.

to PAUL STREETER re: R/RESTORE COMMAND

I think your restore command is "dying", i.e. there should be no
circumstances under which it doesn't give you a legitimate error
message of some sort.  Even if it thought it was done, I'd think
it would do something like say it was done, and the beep is a total
mystery.
  Try comparing the restore program you're using against one from the
distribution disk (the COMP command) to see if it might be in error.
  Good luck!

Never a problem here with computer related ads for materials and services as
long as they are in straight text and not set up as newspaper display ads
with lots of caps and borders.

to ALL re: OCR SOFTWARE???

I have about 2000 lead sheets from a computer magazine with names and
addresses on them. I also own an HP scanjet.  Is there any OCR software
out there that will let me specify a window on my scanner, and then
read my sheets, turning them into ASCII?
The typeface is not a dot matrix one- it is fixed width. I would need a t
trainable system.

Does anyone know of a public domain file compression program for which

absolute last word in efficiency. I need to port it to an oddball OS.
