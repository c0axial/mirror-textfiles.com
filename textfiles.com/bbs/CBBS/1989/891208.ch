to BILL WOLFF re: R/QUATTRO-PRO

What does Q-Pro offer that others don't have? Well, not sure, since
I'm not all that familiar with the others.
 First, I seldom forget and forgive, so the fact that 123 was copy
protected all those years, drove me to N.C.P. alternatives like Super
Calc, and then Quattro.
 What I like about it is the super grap annotation ability. You can
write even "text" charts, which have NO normal graphs in them (i.e. are
NOT pie charts or line charts - just a blank tablet that you can draw
lines & circles, and nicely boxed (a jillion ways) text, arrows, etc.
 It runs fairly well on a 10mhz 286, while Excel might need a bigger
engine. It has the ability to imbed graphs in the spreadsheet (up to
8, I found out tonight as I added the 9th). It has bitstream fonts
which makes it produce EXCELLENT output on "any" printer (expecially
a 300 DPI one like my DeskJet). That alone is worth it.
 With Excel, (I taught some general "pc usage" classes) I kept hearing
"gee, the biggest question we get is 'why does Excel run out of memory
so often'" while with Q-Pro and its VROOM (Virtual Resource object
whoosie fandango manager) it even reportedly runs in 512K! I know
I have probably only 500K or so FREE (of 640) and it has 150 or more
K free even with my biggest spreadsheet (600 rows perhaps).
 Then there's the price ($99 introductory price if you're a Borland
"regular") or $70 upgrade from $99 old Quattro (or free if you Beta
tested, as some do).
 OOh, line noise starting{to eat me alive! gotta run.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/QUATTRO-PRO

I was thinkning of getting Quatro but figured with the low
price they might be Beta testing it for the future V1.1. The
price is sure right with the ads!

Forget about DOS 4.01 on an XT. It takes 30K MORE! Nice if you

housekeepers who keep cleaning off the hard disk by removing
important programs and data. Is there a way to READ lock the

Msg 42860 is 13 line(s) on 12/07/89 from KEVIN KING
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: XMODEM ON PICK OS

I'm trying to implement an XMODEM transfer between Procomm Plus and the
Pick OS on a variety of different Pick platforms. Because the Pick OS
does not allow ASCII 255 to be sent or received, the checksum algorithm
is inappropriate. I have been told that CRC-16 will not send the
ASCII 255 and would be a good error checking mechanism. If this is
true, can you explain (in human English) how to implement this in
a pseudo-BASIC code?

Please call me @ (303) 458-7735 (mountain time) if you can help, or I will
check here for a response tomorrow.

I have a Western Digital Hard Disk Controller for an XT. Model WD-10032S.
Can this be set up as a secondard hard disk controller? If so, does anyone
anyone have any spec sheets on it. If you do, I would greatly appreciate
it if someone could leave a message here or better yet, FAX it to my
work at 312-977-9063 ATTENTION James Polous, MIS Department. Thanks

Msg 42862 is 03 line(s) on 12/07/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to RICHARD HINTON re: R/MACINTOSH SECURITY?

There's been a fair amount of discussion on this in the national education
echo, which is available on several Fidonet systems around here (one is the
Bit Wiz at 312-935-6809).

Msg 42863 is 08 line(s) on 12/07/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to KEVIN KING re: R/XMODEM ON PICK OS

Unfortunately, you CAN get a 255 when using CRC; assuming that the distribution
of the CRC bytes is truly random, you could expect one of the CRC bytes to
be 255 about once every 128 blocks. In addition, of course, you could get 255
as a block number, and if you're transferring data consisting of other than
printable text, you could have a 255 in the data. You really need to use
a protocol like Kermit, which provides escape mechanisms for representing
"special" characters. Of course, there's a tradeoff; Kermit's throughput
is a lot lower than Xmodem's. Xmodem was designed for transparent data links.

Msg 42864 is 04 line(s) on 12/08/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to KEVIN KING re: R/XMODEM ON PICK OS

Sorry, that's not true. The block numbers can also take any value,
so for example the 255th block sent will have
a value of FF. Sorry, you're out of luck if you can't
send or receive a 255.

Msg 42865 is 09 line(s) on 12/08/89 from KEVIN KING
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: XMODEM ON PICK OS

Believe it or not, thanks to a couple of system quirks, we were able to
implement checksum XMODEM on both an Ultimate and Adds box with a lot of
time and effort. If anyone is interested, give me a call @ (303) 430-
8881 and we can discuss this.

Thanks for the quick response!
