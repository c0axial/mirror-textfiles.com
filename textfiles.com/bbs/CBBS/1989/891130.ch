to JAMES SCHMIDT re: R/CLEANING DISKETTE DRIVES

I'd say "do it, but seldom" - i.e. maybe once a year or something. OR,
what I probably mean, is, do it once every hundred hours of head-down
time, which is impossible to measure, but which would be VERY high for
a heavily used diskette-only system, and lightly used by someone with
a big system who has a tape for backups.
 I run a BBS off of a floppy, and occasionally get read errors, but
only about once a year or so so I'm looking for a - get this - 8" cleaning
diskette because it is so hard to get the drives apart.
 I'm sure they make 3.5" cleaning diskettes.
 I, too, notice that when a diskette fails, it is often with a fairly
significant scratch in the media - and I ponder what could have caused it.
What I usually come up with is that enough oxide must have built up on
the head, and perhaps it then "half flakes off" or something leaving a
sharp edge. It would be interesting to look at drive heads with a
50 power microscope, but since double sided disks came along it is just
too hard to get them opened up enough to really see the heads.

to DON PARIS re: MEMORY ERROR

I think I had a 4020 201 error on my machine, and that the 40 was the bit
that failed, and the 20 was the "bank" that the error occurred in - i.e.
the 2nd (numbered 0, 1, 2) bank of 64K on the motherboard.
 If you're convinced that your error is in the extended memory board,
what I recommend is taking about 4 chips at a time and swapping them
with other chips in another row. Pry them out carefully, perhaps with
a small screwdriver slid under the end - but be careful about "levering"
against breakable capacitors or other components. Also be careful to
work in a way that wouldn't induce static discharge - some people actually
work on a table with a wet newspaper on it to ground things out - but for
sure as you work inside the machine kind of keep one finger on the power
supply (silver box) or at least touch if you walk around at all, to ensure
you don't zap something. If you have the patience to "swap" the chips,
like I say, perhaps 4 at a time, you should be able to narrow down ONE
chip eventually which when swapped causes different numbers to show up.
 What kind of expansion board is it? Is it the IBM 64-256 memory
expansion option? (it has 4 banks of 9-64K chips, in 3 rows of 12
or something like that).
 Good luck.

Did you see the Sound Blaster board from Brown-Wagh (BALLY'S)?
They have a Game Blaster ($100) that produces sound for games
specially written to address it. 12 voices? stereo output.
The Sound Blaster also has a MIDI port and was like $150.
Not MPU 401 compatible.

 Covox was what I recalled what you mentioned.
 My wife and I were discussing it the other day, is why I
asked; the topic of conversation being computers and the
disabled.
 I see I am going to have to visit Eric Bohlman's BBS.

Glad that you had a good flight on UAL.
Even tho' I have thousands of hours in aircraft, I'm a real novice
with computer simulations. I've been trying to get a
good landing out of Advanced Flight Trainer for some time. (grin)
Just got in from a 5 day flight sequence and guess it is time to
quit for the day.
Best to ya',

Thanks for resetting the FLASH. I appreciate it. Will probably get
in touch soon to discuss it. I'm thinkg about getting ESIX (from
Everex), as my machine is an Everex OEM, and their prices are about
half that of SCO's! Will let you know what happens.
