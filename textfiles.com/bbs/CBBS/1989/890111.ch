]Ward, I'll talk to the powers that be regarding getting you an error
correcting demo.  Maybe a Courier 2400 PC, which is a dynamite interna{.
I'll leave you a message soon.

Msgs 16-19 or so have lists of BBS numbers - hopefully you'll find some
help on one of those BBSs. Sorry the list is out-of-date - the originator
no longer creates a list, apparently!

I don't think the 4096 is an RLLable drive. Get a regular Western Digital
or perhaps Omti. One caution - the 4096 might have more heads than
some controllers support.
 Yes, your power supply will have to go. If it doesn't, then it will.
 DOS 3.3 would be fine - since it supports the partitioning of large
hard drives.
 BTW, I'm installing a purely-AT drive in my XT. There really isn't
any difference as long as the controller can support the particular
drive configuration.

The DeskJet (1) uses plain paper ink; and (2) has a hole in the top for
letting air in, which you can squirt ink into. I've also thought about
re-inking the ThinkJet cartridges, but I'll have to wait for one to
empty then stare at it closely enough to see if I can see WHERE you'd
put the ink in. It appears the ink-jet holes are the only place that
goes between the outside world and the "bladder".
 Ya, you could probably drill a hole if there were some place sufficiently
out of the way (of the electrical contacts, etc) and a dab of hot-melt glue
would prolly do the trick.
 Do you have problems with the cartridge not working well when you first
turn it on? All my cartridges (2 diff ones, at least) do partial
"spraying" when first used - I tend to run a full-page test pattern in
the AM, but within an hour or possibly much less, the first line of any
printout is like a "ramp" of dots "coming to life" across the line.
 I, too like the Thinkjet - bought one for $175 and use it at work,
mostly for screen prints. Tried both plain paper and regular cartridges,
am now having "fun" with a blue cartridge (though a black one had the
same problem). Perhaps it is my low duty-cycle that prevents it from
really inking well. I dunno.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/RE-INKING

 As near as I can tell, the bladder is attached only at the business
end. The possible fill hole I mentioned is to the right of the contact
plate, and looks like a recessed plastic hemisphere. When my current
cartridge gets low enough I will get on some old clothes and drill it
out. It should then be easy enough to refill, but now I'm beginning
to think that it is critical to exclude air bubbles. And then there
is always the question of whether regular ink will really work.
 You got a good deal at $175, because mine was $250 several years ago.
I use it mostly at home, where noise is a factor. I was about to say
I don't have the startup problem, but then tried it and noticed that
some of the lower dot rows didn't start up right away. After about
ten lines it cleared up.
 When you do prints of text screens, can you get the line-drawing
characters? Mine gives either blanks or the seven-bit equivalent,
depending on how the DIP switches are set.

to ALL re: R/4096 DRIVES

Installing a big drive like the ST4096 in an AT can be simplified
by using the Disk Manager program (usually included with the drive)
If you do the low level format and partition using thef;3 Disk Manager,
it will install it's own device driver and let you make multiple volumes.
I've got a 4096 formatted as drives E, F and G in a system that has
another hard disk that doesn't rely on the disk manager. The two coexist
with no problems.
Someone mentioned RLL, I would say NAY with this drive.

Msg 41146 is 03 line(s) on 01/11/89 from MIKE COOK
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/HELP W/ ST4026 HARD DISK

Thanks, Ward. One thing, though. w3 It's a 4026, not a 4096.
Assume that doesn't change your advice, other than I don't
have to worry about partitioning +32 MEG.

 I am finishing up my latest program, an EGA graphic Palm Reading
report writer. The one that is almost 200K code now and 150K data file.
 Question! I have 42 menu screens with the options ranging from
3 to dual menus of 16 options each. Would it be a LOT nicer and
more convienent if I used "choice bars" rather than alpha-numeric
choices (a-z and 1-9). It would be a pain to do and it is only
going for $24 with a few dollars worth of printouts included.
 There are over 440 options total in the program and it seems
simple to ME but then again this is supposed to be for novices.
 A reply on prefference would help. I have about 2 months till my ad
comes out in Comp Shopper where I can really change it around but
then again the size is awfully large now. It will probably be
over 300K compiled. It runs at about 275K complied now and I am
just starting the printout routine.
