to ALL re: ASCII MAP BOUNDARY FILES

 dear friends,
my company is looking for sources of ascii map boundary files
(made up of latitude/longitude coordinates, one set per record)
for state, county and city boundaries in the u.s., as well as
files for foreign countries, particularly europe.
we'd be interested in either obtaining unlimited distribution
copies, or in reseller agreements.
if you know of any sources for map files, please leave me a note
here, or contact my self or Pat Fleury at SYSTAT: 864-5670, or
call me at 764-5963. many thanks for any info you can provide!
dup. chars.
