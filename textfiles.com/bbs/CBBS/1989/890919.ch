For sure - special software.
 The thing is 100% graphics oriented. Also, there's a 250K "cache"
file kept on your hard disk (dunno if it is implemented if you're on
a floppy, or not). This means that if you look at the weather map,
then go do something else, then come back to the weather map, if the
map hasn't changed, they show the "copy" you have in your CACHE file.
 Heh heh, it would be interesting to see if someone figures out how
to "print out" the cache file!
 One thing the program does - agonizingly - is steal the keyboard
interrupt, and throw away ALL keystrokes (including print-screen) until
it really wants them (NEVER allowing print-screen). Strangely, my
ctrl-alt enabled program still gets control, so they must "filter" out
certain chars or something.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/PRODIGY AVAILABLE NOW

They're probably trapping interrupt 5, which is want eventually gets
called by print-screen. Probably wouldn't be much use anyway, since
from what I've heard (never used it and have no interest in doing so,
though a friend is getting into it), it uses a graphics-mode screen.

Msg 42501 is 06 line(s) on 09/19/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to RICHARD HINTON re: R/RLL/MFM

I know some controllers are accessed at c800:ccc, though I seem to remember
them being Adaptec RLL controllers. There's another location in segment
c800 you could try, though I forget which one it is (I <think> it's either
0 or 8). In any case, you could just as well use Disk Manager to do the
low-level format and then use something else to set up the partitions; the
low-level formatting is the same.

Msg 42502 is 03 line(s) on 09/19/89 from RICHARD HINTON
to ALL re: VGA/MULTISYNC??

Can CGA software run on a VGA monitor? I am thinking of picking up
a manufacturer overstock of an Amdek VGA monitor, but I am wondering
if my software will run it. Thanks.
