OK, "no" you can't submit the name to me. Submit it to the source of
the list - see msg 42053. Good luck with the new board!

to BRENT JONES re: R/PRODIGY WARNING

Yes, if Prodigy does nothing more than allow widespread Email, it will
be worth it - I think.
 They specifically are NOT trying to compete with BBSs, and therefore
have no "file" area, no upload or download, etc.
 See #42388 for an interesting dis-like of Prodigy.

Gee, sorry - it (X function) worked OK for me. The "h;;chat" is
supposed to pop up ONLY when someone types CHAT, since there's no one
to answer the chat, it goes into chat-help which says "don't chat". ;-)

Sorry you're suffering from all the line noise! My 2 new 9600 baud
modems are "lost" (in the "drop off at store to have sent to UPS"
"but never arrived at USR" sense).
 Hayes had an S-100 modem in - what - late '77, and Randy decided that
could be used to run a dial-in system, which I originally suggested would
be for people to modem in club newsletter items, but Randy suggested a
more general purpose board.
 We did it on S-100 "gear" at the time, since Randy was "into" the hobby
enough by then to "have a system lying around". It took some hacking,
but Randy got the hardware going, and I got the software going.
 I'm sorry, I just have NO idea what kind of money it cost. When you
bought memory boards for $525 for SIXTEEN K and thought you were getting
a bargain, well, lets just say it cost a LOT back then. 'Course, Randy
always has been a "scrounger" and seems to come up with "deals". ;-)

to BILL WOLFF re: DTP PROGRAMS (REPLY)

Bill, I may be wrong but I believe GeoLaser works with any Postscript
compatible printer. Check w/ Berkley softworks they can be very helpful.
I also wonder if your Printer (thr HP Laser II) couldn't be upgraded to
Postscript compatibility. I sure other callers to the board will know the
answer to that question. Good Luck, Jim

Folks, I would recommend that you definitely try out Prodigy. It is not
as zippy as BBS or CompuServe but this is due to the high use of graphics.
To see color you need EGA, but the monochrome CGA on my Toshiba 1200F looks
pretty good. The price is definitely right-$9.95 per MONTH -not $12.50
per hours like Compu$erve (as some spell it).
 Draw backs 1) little 3 line graphics ads on each screen-but you have
about that much in a magazine 2) slow response time-what do you expect
with PCs at 2400 baud and 8088/6 chips [I have to admit that the
"mainframe" used by IBM and Sears sure acts like a Commodore 64 acting
as a file server for 100 terminals, but lets give them a chance to
speed it up over the next year before we finally judge.
 The Prodigy kit costs $39.99 (mine was $42.69 after the state of IL took
their "cut") but this includes 3 months of free service. I wish that I
could have gotten one of the free kits but I wanted to get on-line as soon
as I could.
 Finally, I do not work for IBM, Sears or have anything to gain from
your use of Prodigy. But don't criticize it until you have spent some
time giving it a try. There is a PC Club by the way.
 The kit is returnable for a full refund within 30 days.
