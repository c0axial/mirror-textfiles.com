Msg 41567 is 08 line(s) on 03/25/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/IBMAUX1?

IBMAUX1 is a dual-I/O driver - it looks for both local keyboard and
via int 14, remote keyboard (allows running a remote dumb terminal,
also, I'd thingk). All output is sent to both the RS-232 and to the
local console. This allows - at a minimum - the local CRT to display
all output, rather than just being "blank" while I'm in DOS doing
house cleaning.
 However, I think one "hack" we'll probably try will be changing to
shelling to command.com with a COM1: driver instead of ibmaux1.

Msg 41568 is 19 line(s) on 03/25/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/BOARD LEVEL REPAIR.!

I think the ability to fix your own machine is totally dependent upon
the complexity of the problem.
 For example, at power up over the last 5 years I've had my PC, it has
on 3 occasions given me a memory error (I don't mean to imply I didn't
have any problems - the memory problems caused Parity Check msgs
while I was running software - or when I had Periscope resident, it
would think I was hitting the break out button).
 I was always fairly trivially able to replace the memory chip.
 However, later on, my breakout button for Periscope stopped working,
and I found out that my NMI was in fact broken, meaning I'd never be
able to detect a memory error again!
 There are about 5 chips in the parity check circuitry (from the
bus-connector to the processor connector, but I couldn't find any
way to really find which was at fault, and while I replaced one chip,
I didn't solve it. The parity errors are much easier - and the easiest
are the power-on messages telling you which chip is in trouble.
 I decided to replace the motherboard, and now have a one megabyte
8mhz 0-wait state 286 in my original PC. Works great, makes the system
quite useable.

Msg 41572 is 16 line(s) on 03/26/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: CBBS 9600 BAUD!

CBBS is now fully operational with the new HST donated by US Robotics.
 Thanks to them, we can now handle 300, 1200, 2400, (4800? untested)
and 9600. Output will seem slow at 9600 due to parallel local console
being driven - PCs are notorious for their slow scrolling.
 ARQ (i.e. MNP) is supported also.
 Thanks to the interrupt driven RS232 routine, we're interrupt driven.
RS232: by Mike Macgirvin, Mountain View, CA. This is v1.00 (8/7/86)
 I will try to (1) get the MSTATS routine back so you can all see the
percentage of calls by speed; and (2) Randy wants a default of turning
the local monitor off so it will scroll faster at 9600 baud.
 Thanks again, USR. Thanks Mike Macgirvin.
 P.S. this is STILL running in 8080 code, using Mike Day's V80-20.
 Gee: MIKE Day's V-20 routine, MIKE Andrews of USR arranged the modem
donation, MIKE Macgirvin supplied the interrupt routine, MIKE Warot gave
me IBMAUX1 (dual console driver) that initially allowed CBBS to move to
a PC. ;-)

Msg 41573 is 18 line(s) on 03/26/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to THOMAS STUTESMAN re: R/NEED PROGRAMMING HELP ASAP

What kind of modem do you have? The newer modems all should have an
extended result code which detects things like "busy", "no answer",
"voice", etc. Then a simple routine - probably BASIC would be most
easy - could simply send the dial strings to the modem and watch for
the result codes.
 In BASIC you can talk to the modem via:
 open "com1:1200,n,8,1,rs,ds" as 1
 then you can send strings to the modem via:
 print #1,"atdt5458086"+chr$(13)
and can watch for input from the modem with:
 if loc(1) > 0 then x$=input(#1,loc(1):goto ___ (got input)
 Now you have to be a basic programmer to take these tidbits and turn
them into a program!
 Also, I may have the #1,loc(1) reversed (may be loc(1),#1) in that
input statement.
 I think the modems use the ATXn command to set the result code to
a value that would give you the most verbose and informative answers
to what it sees after dialing the call.

Msg 41574 is 19 line(s) on 03/26/89 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/BOARD LEVEL REPAIR.!

I suppose you're right. But in MOST cases, it should be within
the capability of the user to fix things. I began to adopt this
perspective many years ago as a ham operator. I was 14 when the
power supply in my rig (high volts, lots of tubes) began blowing
fuses. I called up the local repair place, and they said, "Oh,
$30 an hour plus parts, 2 hour minimum." I was able to isolate
the problem as a $0.50 rectifier in the power supply. Since then,
I have tried to avoid owning things I can't fix - or, in the
alternative, I have tried to learn to fix that which I have. It
makes for an eclectic education.
 As for the NMI stuff, the nice feature of NMI.COM is that it REPLACES
the built-in NMI checks. If it hits an error at any point after
it's installed, it tells you where the error is, by address, bank,
and bit (chip). Lots easier than the POST information. There are
probably other 'autodiagnostic' tools. We need a complete list
of them, since diagnosis is the first step toward cure.
 On the other hand, the new motherboard sounds like a great idea.
But you're talking to somebody who still does most of his work on
a 4 MHz Z80 machine.

Msg 41576 is 19 line(s) on 03/27/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to MICHAEL SZEWCZYK re: R/XMODEM CRC

Here's a routine that should get you started. Your BASIC probably has
better structuring facilities than the rather generic code here, but
at least it's a start. Note that I'll be appending a "%" to names
of variables that should be integers.

1000 rem update CRC value
1010 rem c=current character, crc=present crc value
1020 crc%=crc% xor (c% * 256)
1030 for i=1 to 8
1040 t=0
1050 if crc% and 32768 then t=1
1060 crc%=crc% + crc%
1070 rem thanks to Ward C. for suggesting the above
1080 if t<>0 then crc%=crc% xor 4129
1090 next i

I'm assuming that you have an exclusive-or operator and that it's called
"xor" (it might be "eor" on some systems). This is just a quick hack,
but I THINK it will do the trick.

to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/DISK

Last week I was doing some work on a 10NET superstation, and
while I didn't notice any overall slowdown, there were times
when the cursor seemed to 'stick' to a spot; these times were
during disk accesses by other stations. Something like that
would be very noticable but still take only a small percentage
of the available CPU time. Maybe that's what your customer
was talking about.

Hi Roy. Saw your message to Alex Zell and thought I would update
you on the information I gave to Mike Andrews about the ORIGINAL
CBBS modem I own. I bought it from Randy after it had problems
after about the first 50,000 calls. I then paid to have the
manufacturer repair it for me and used it in my early ALTAIR 8800
for almost a year. I used it until I went to an external modem,
but to the best of my recollection I started to have some problems
with the auto answer feature.
 I just thought I would clear up the confusion about Randy
"loaning" it to me. It is one one my most prized posessions, but
I have talked to Mike Andrews about the posibility of submitting
it for the "Smithsonian Project". SEEYA, Roger
