]Why no TRS-80 CO CO messages.  I have a COCO III system that I'd match
against anybody's.  I'd appreciate a return message  to justify your
policy.  The club I belong to and BBS they run are also first rate.
Many professional programmers/hackers in the club that prefer their
coco's to the more expensive systems they wor with on the job.  COCO
III and os9 are a powerful combination,  I don't understand your dismissal
of a fine system here. Peggy

 Tnx.

Msg 41546 is 26 line(s) on 03/22/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/IBMAUX1?

I'm not using IBMAUX1 for CBBS - I do my own dual-console routines from
within CBBS.
 Specifically, I have "RS232" (the interrupt driver) in my AUTOEXEC,
then the BAT file for CBBS is like this:
 :again <- this provides a loop label
 v20-80 cbbs %1 <- this fires up the emulator and CBBS
 command aux1 /c cbbstodos <- This fires up a new command shell with
 ibmaux1 as its console driver, and runs a bat file
 goto again
 Then the CBBSTODOS.BAT file is like this:
 password
 if errorlevel 1 goto noway
 command
 :noway
 Actually, it is not exactly like that - I'm trying to do this from
(a faulty.) memory. BUT, the point is that I run aux1 only with a
secondary command processor, to provide DOS access, primarily for
renaming files, and I don't give that access unless a THIRD level of
passwords is properly entered (two within CBBS, one at the DOS level).
 Your idea that AUX1 might be initializing the ports sounds "reasonable",
but I think that only MODE COMn.is SUPPOSED to do that. I'm starting
to fiddle around - since I can reproduce this problem right here at home
with my backup WardBoard system (an old PC Portable running a V-20).
 I DID check my interrupt vectors, and when things are bad, the vectors are
still where they were when things were OK.
 Thanks for the ideas.

to ALL re: NEED INFO ON NEW HARDWARE

I am presently using a Tandy-1000HD w/640K and am tired of the 1-1/2 minutes
it takes to reboot each time I make a programming error. And, of course, the
hard disk(10meg) has been full for years. So, it's time for new equipment
At my budget level, it will obviously have to be a clone.
What I am looking for is information on two specific companies.
They are: PC Brands and Gateway-2000.
I've talked to both. Read ads and articles in PC-Mag,Pc-Computing,Pc Shopper,
and a few others.
All this advertising won't tell me if these companies are reliable. So,
if there is anyone that has had dealings with these companies I beg for your
input. PLEASE!
The system I'm considering is a 20meg 286 or 386 with 2megs mem. and a 4096
80meg drive, a 1.44 and 1.2meg drives, a 2400 modem and mouse.
Both these companies have like systems. While PC Brand has a 5-yr LIMITED
warranty; it only covers their house brands(which I wouldn't be getting any
way). Gateway-2000 offers name brands for close to the prices for which
others are charging for house brands.
I've done my research and I am a tech so I understand the specs but that
won't tell me about the companies.
So, please, if you've dealt with these companies, leave me a message.
Thank You. Steve.

 CONTEST!

Do you own a LaserJet + or compatible printer? Are you missing several
fonts that are found in the LaserJet II? My firm makes a set of soft

that I need a GOOD name for this soft font set. (The current name is
the "Plus Conversion Font Set".) The contest is as follows: send me
your idea for a product name along with you name, address, phone, and
printer manufacturer/model. I will chose a winning package name and award
the person who supplied the name a copy of this soft font package and
a copy of my TSR Download program. ($65 value) Contest closes 4/3/89.
The package includes: a command line soft font downloader, Line Printer
8.5 point 16.66 pitch, Courier 12 point 10 pitch, & Courier Bold 12 point
10 pitch. All fonts come in portrait and landscape and have the line draw-
ing character set (modified PC-8). Send entries to: Elfring Soft Fonts,
P.O. Box 61, Wasco, IL 60183. Or leave a message here. The decision of
the judge is final. Void where prohibited.
