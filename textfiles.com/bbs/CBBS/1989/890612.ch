to JIM JOYCE re: R/BOOT-UP PROBLEM

You've received quite some replies! . I had a similar problem early on when
attempting to upgrade my DOS. My immediate reaction was the same as yours:
Copying the two "hidden" files and COMMAND.COM onto C:. But this can royally
muck things up. Problem is, the hidden files must be the FIRST two files
placed on the HD or they'll never be found. At this point, there's a good
chance your friend will have to back up all files, then erase all files on
the HD, and finally copy them back in EXACTLY the right order (IO.SYS before
MSDOS.SYS if your friend is running MS-DOS, else the equivalent files). It's
best to use the SYS command to do this to ensure all is automatically done
corretly.If THAT doesn't solve it, it could be a drive (or controller or
cable) problem. I've also had a HD which just became too slow to boot in a
sufficiently timely way, so the operating system considered it "unavailable"
at boot time, but available a few seconds later-which would yield the same
symptoms. Finally, I've had a cable which was just loose enough to result
in the same thing. So, if SYSing (you might as well reformat before that
with the procedures others have outlined for safe measure in case something
became trashed, and to eliminate more variables), then I'd suggest swapping
one item at a time-cable, HD, and controller board-to see which is the
source of the problem. (Of course, ensure all swapped parts are compatible
with each other!) Good luck.

Thanks for the info. Actually, an IBM person gave me some
literature about a new Micropolis drive that runs 1.2 GBytes!
Anyway, the problem with the RT that we looked at was that,
as I recall now, you had to partition the UNIX file system
into 'minidisks,' so the largest single file you could have
could not exceed a minidisk in size - and since the largest
stcck drive was 320M, that wasn't big enough (complain,
complain). Anyway, I probably won't contack Randy, since I'm
only going to be in Chicago for another 10 days (actually leave
on the 28th, but I'm spending a week in Utah first).
.
I also wanted to thank you for all the help and entertainment
over the years. I first logged onto CBBS more than five years
ago, so I have some feeling for the critter. I've got a great
deal of good advice over the years. I hope that you manage to
keep this board functioning for a loooong time.!

Try VDE as a text editor. Limits you to 64K or so files, but it's
small and fast. For text handling, there's always ROFF4. Both of
these programs started out in CP/M, but MS-DOS versions are available.
I'd never heard of the hardram, but it sounds like a real good idea.
I use a little CP/M laptop (Epson Geneva) and it's slow, but with
TINY CP/M programs. loading is quick. I use a version of VDE that's
around 11K, no text formatter, though, as I don't output to a printer
from the laptop. Check out VDE anyway - great little editor!

t WARD CHRISTENSEN re: XMODEM PROTOCOL

I need a discription of the XMODEM protocol so that I can use it
in a data acquisition system that I am working on. Is the protocol
public domain? Does such a description exist? Please call me (Mark
Shell) at 1-800-635-2699 or leave a message. Thanks!

to ALL re: NEED HELP WITH MIDI

I recently purchased a MIDIator interface for my PS/2 and Rolland S-10
Synth. I encountered a problem when sending multiple sequencer tracks
to the S-10 during playback of a song. The problem is that some notes
cut others off. I ran the Midi Monitor program and traced the problem
to the fact that the S-10 sends an "all-notes-off" command whenever all
the notes are released. Apparently, the sequencer records this command
and sends it back to the synth; this causes all notes to be turned off
at that instant, regardless of what "track" they came from. Is there any
way to defeat the sending of the "all-notes-off" code?
