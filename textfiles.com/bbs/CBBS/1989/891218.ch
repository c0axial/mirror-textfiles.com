to JAMES SCHMIDT re: PS/2 DRIVES

 Sorry, I don't know - but I suspect that at the time the 30-021
came out, there was no plan for the 30-286, much less the 30-E31 version
with its 30M hard drive, so I doubt the ROMS handle that drive.
 Also I believe IBM stepped up to the customer requirements for faster
drives at some time and the newer drives might be different - perhaps
even a different head/cyl layout.

to JAMES SCHMIDT re: AFTERMARKET DRIVES

Not all 3.5"ers have the same form factor - or at least not all have
the same connector.
 My technique for stuff that I don't personally have is to find a
company making a drive THEY say is compatible. For my own purposes,
I either get a controller that is customizable, or got a ROM set that
supports "a jillion drives".
 (It is called "Second Nature Rom").

Msg 42898 is 30 line(s) on 12/16/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to BRENT JONES re: GRANDVIEW/PCO

I use Grandview mostly for writing responses to complicated letters
requesting hardware configurations. It allows me to organize my thoughts
into general categories, then expound on them. (Gee, that's a generic
answer - that is what ALL outliners do!)
 I found one problem: that I need to use it more to be more familiar with
it. There are just too many capabilities for me to memorize all the
added keys. The worst case was where I'd do a FIND then ESC out of it,
almost CURSING the fact that it kept going BACK to where I was, not
staying "at the find". Well, read the manual today, it is as simple as
pressing ENTER to stay there, ESC to go back. VERY good way to do it!
 One problem I have is that I DON'T plan the outline well enough - I
just "write", and find that I have covered things in II/C that were
really supposed to be in III, so I just grab II/C and make it III. That's
"making use of its capabilities" but not correctly. I SHOULD remember
to do it "top down".
 I don't use categories. I don't know what they are. And I accidentally
hit the "gather" key, and got kind of lost. It actually, for now, has
TOO MANY capabilities.
 P.S. don't expect any more mailings from Brown Bag about your copy of
PCO - they just declared bankruptcy. Actually, I HAVE gotten letters
from the "courts" since I was on their registered user list (not BB,
but other companies) and there might have been an obligation for future
free updates or something that would represent a small obligation.
 I have extremely customized the keyboard, but am VERY annoyed at quite
a few things about Grandview - most notably that the keyboard definitions
ONLY apply in 'pure text edit mode'. For example, if you start to move
an item, only the unwanted cursor keys work, not MY CONTROL KEYS for
"cursor down". Also, the thing can't seem to be customized for short
on-screen lines, so it doesn't jump back and forth! VERY VERY VERY
annoying. I was working w/2 other people and continually apologizing for it!

to CHERYL SLUDER re: R/STARTING UP A BBS

Sorry, no. If you have questions, leave a msg. But remember, this
BBS was started by Randy Suess (at whose house it still resides) in
February of 1978, so to ask me about "starting a BBS" is only relevant
from the historical sense. For example, we don't have "doors",
"downloads", etc.

Msg 42900 is 12 line(s) on 12/16/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JAMES KARAGANIS re: R/COPY NAME1+NAME2

Oh, ok, thanks. I've always had the ^Z get eaten OK. (more to the
point, I noticed that an UNWANTED ^Z appears at the end of the
final file - I know it wasn't in either file to start.).
 I've started writing my own append command - to append the "send" files
to a "sent" file, but also to append the date and time before the file.
 For example, for Compuserve, I might have "IBMHW.S", which I send, then
append to "CIS.SNT", but without a header SAYING it is a send file
to IBMHW, it is not as meaningful, and very hard to do anything with
at a later time.
 But then again like magazines, I tend to keep things I SHOULDN'T, and
some day my house is going to sink! - just as my hard drives "sink"
from all the data I have on 'em (they're always full).

Msg 42901 is 05 line(s) on 12/16/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to RICHARD HINTON re: R/6 OR ABOVE BOARD?

People who have the Inboard 386 from Intel love it. The price is quite
outstanding - something like 5-600 for a 386!
 If you got enough memory (say 2M) on an inboard, you could use one of
the magic programs that turns extended memory into expanded (like QEMM 386
or 386^MAX (pronounced 386-to-the-max).

to ALL re: MCA INTERNAL MODEM DISK

I picked up a used PS/2 Model 50 that included an IBM internal modem.
Unfortunately, a power surge caused the software configuration to be
lost and the computer no longer recognizes the modem. Does anyone
have the configuration diskette for this modem?

Msg 42905 is 06 line(s) on 12/16/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to ALL re: COPYRIGHT HELP.

 I know about copyrighting a program "I" write but I am asking about
a program I write using third party TOOLS (copyrighted, bought!).
 Do you just include on the Copyright form that part is already
copyrighted? and leave out ANY code to that effect on the printout?
 i.e., just print out the code "I" wrote and leave the rest to
the commercial TOOLS copyright?

Msg 42906 is 17 line(s) on 12/16/89 from BRENT JONES
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/GRANDVIEW/PCO

Ward,
 I would suggest strongly that you give PC Outline a try, at least for
an hour or so. I have been using it very heavily for about 18 months.
And I think that many of the annoying things that you mentioned about
Grandview *May* not be in PCO. The keyboard macros are very nicely
done. Just watch out for and change Ctrl + RtArrow if you are used
to the WordStar conventions for cursor movements. WS gives word right,
but PCO gives DELETE word right! Ditto for Ctrl + LeftArrow.
 The category feature of Grandview is the main reason that I would
go to it. I think that you should read about 5 pages of the manual on it
and give it a little trial. You might not ever use it but the reviews
of GV say it is a great feature.
 What do you think will happen to all the software owned by Brown Bag?
Will it go to new owners? or to Public Domain? If PCO had been sold
for about $75 thru normal software sales (rather than shareware) BB
might still be in business.
 How is the bulletin board going for the IBM campus reps?

Msg 42907 is 04 line(s) on 12/16/89 from BRENT JONES
to ALL re: EDITORS

 I am wondering what are the favorite editors of the people who
visit this BBS. I have been using a lot of different things,
including good ole WordStar.
 Anyone have any very small editors that are PD or shareware?

Msg 42908 is 02 line(s) on 12/17/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to BRENT JONES re: R/EDITORS

I use VDE as a programming editor a lot. It's nice and small, Wordstar
compatible, and I'm pretty well used to it. Works nicely for me.

Msg 42909 is 08 line(s) on 12/17/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/COPYRIGHT HELP.

I guess it would depend on how much of the third-party libraries exist
in source rather than object form. If portions of the third-party stuff
make it into the source, I'd just include the copyright notice that came with
them. There's also an option to leave certain portions of the source
blank; you could do that in your submission, with a comment to the effect
that those portions are copyright by third parties (this does, however, mean
that you have to submit more of your own source than if you didn't blank out
portions).

Msg 42910 is 12 line(s) on 12/17/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/COPYRIGHT HELP.

 With these TOOLS there are "sample" programs used to CALL the
assembly (OBJ) files. The OBJ files are used for compling so
I guess they CANNOT in anyway be included even though the ASM
source for some are included with one KIT.
 The original code will be so short using all the routin}ies
that a few pages mightt even suffice. These QB TOOLS get SO
inclusive that they can do most of the pgm except the MAIN purpose
which wouldbe NEW code. At least it would save on mailing when
sending in a copy of the code! I guess the Copyright notice
of 3rd party tools ON the form is enough plus a REM about
the TOOLS used. Then again if the name is NOT given for the TOOLS
no one can figure it out! Will have to read the FORM closer.

ADPCM? What is this? I know Linear Predictive Coding LPC.
I had the impression the memory was maybe Eprom? What does it
take to program ROM?
Thanks for the info.
