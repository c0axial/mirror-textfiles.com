I suggest leaving a msg to "all". There were quite a few msgs about
S-100 systems back in the S-100 days (say from 78 thru maybe 82 or 83
or 84) but I've not seen too many in the last 3-4 years or more.

to MARTY DIPPEL re: R/DIFF BETWEEN LPT1 AND LPT1:

Your shell is simply parsing your command in a wierd way. Unfortunately,
as with any software product, you just have to learn its particular syntax
rules.or find another product. (Even more unfortunately, many products
attempt to "improve" upon syntax that a DOS expects. That can <sometimes>
make life a trifle easier for casual users, but essentially is a pain in
the %&( for those familiar with the DOS. <sigh>)

I don't actually think that is if "official" in 312 yet, but there are
several working numbers. Just ask the Prodigy people if you need a
more local one. Brent

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/PRODIGY WARNING

Just after I asked, I found the little program that will redirect
printer output to disk file. It is called "Prn-File" in the Public
Brand Software catalog. On their disks it is # LB 8.0 -actually
it is part of Buttonware's Baker's Dozen which you might already
have. If you don't have the Public Brand Catalog give them a
call at 1-800-426-DISK. The catalogs are free-disks are $5.
 What do you mean hex and un-hex? I don't understand how this applys
to Prodigy.
 I agree with you that the E-mail is not as swift at CIS with TAPCIS.
Perhaps they will get to the point where they allow up and downloading
with e-mail and files. That will probably make or break Prodigy. Few
will use an e-mail service that is not as "slick" as it possibly can
be. That is why your board impresses me. It is so simple to get and
send messages here.
 Do you think that there are too many forums on CIS. I find the degree of
specialization a bit much. But there is a lot of traffic and I guess that
it has to be broken down in some fashion to be managable.
 Have you ever used ENS -Exec. News Service? I set up a folder with
keywords of interest to me. It works nicely except for not being able
to download directly-I send them to my EasyPlex box.
 Where will the BBS world be in 20 years? You helped start it, your opinion
surely counts. Will we have seamless e-mail across MCI, CIS, Prodigy (or
its child)? Will the private BBS still exist?

to BILL WOLFF re: R/LIKE PRODIGY???

 Prodigy is pure commercial in that it gives you ads on each screen-
well almost every screen. But that is how the cost is a flat $9.95.
I really think that this is the last great hope for VideoText. If
SEARS and IBM can make it go, then it can't fly.
 But a computer-link with graphics and e-mail is somewhere in the
future for us. If Prodigy allows file transfers and gets links with
Europe, Asia and S. America then it will no doubt be a hit-assuming
cost remains low. When EGA computers get to $500 graphics will really
begin to take off! Will it ever happen?

to ALL re: CORVUS HARD DRIVE

I recently got an old Corvus 10M hard drive with an IBM driver card. I am
having some trouble getting it to work in an IBM XT clone as it wants to see
DOS 1.1. Anybody have any ideas?Anybody know of any old working Corvus systems
that could be of any use?? I reali this is a long shot - but I like
tinkering with old junk. But this may be be what I can do. Thanks.

Msg 42471 is 07 line(s) on 09/11/89 from DAVID GIBBS
to ALL re: PRODIGY

Personally, I think that Prodigy is a very good system for novice users
who are just getting into their computers. Once they get more advanced
they are going to want something more powerfull like C-Serve or GEnie.
