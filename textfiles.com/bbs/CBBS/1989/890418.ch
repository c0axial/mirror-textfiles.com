Where would be a good place to get information about the relatively
low-level details of hard-disk interfacing, particularly controller-pr
processor interfacing? In other words, how to incorporate a hard drive
into a system (but not necessarily a general-purpose computer). I
ask because I may be involved in the design of a voice-storage system
which will incorporate an HD and won't be based on any off-the-shelf
computer.

Msg 41698 is 23 line(s) on 04/18/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: <$50 PC SPEECH SYNTH

Got a GREAT new toy last night - Covox Speech Thing.
 I bought it from Nelson Ford's Public (Software) Library, POB 35705,
Houston TX 77235-5705, (713) 665-7017.
 What is it? A "thing" which is a D/A converter that hooks TO YOUR
EXISTING PARALLEL PORT - and your printer hooks into the back of IT, so
you don't lose any function. Like the no-slot-clock, this is one of those
"doesn't take anything away from you" great add-on products.
 You load up over 80K of resident text-to-speech code, then run a BASIC
program and tell it what file to speak.
 Full source comes for the routines to access the resident speech routines,
in BASIC or C.
 I wrote a little program to strip out the message header stuff from
Compuserve messages, and then I run the BASIC program to speak it. Variable
speed, pitch, etc - just great!
 I can see an ambitious person developing applications to use it even
better - one shortcoming is there's no "interactive" phoneticization - i.e.
if it says a word wrong, you can't interactively "toy" with fixing the
word - but it DOES have a full list of the phonemes, and the ability to
add mis-pronounced words to a dictionary (which it apparently looks up
in assembly as part of the speaking process).
 Just barely have used it, and am "ear training" to recognize words
it has slight difficulty with. It is VERY understandable WHEN YOU'RE
READING ALONG, but will take a bit of time to learn its pronunciation.

Msg 41699 is 11 line(s) on 04/18/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JIM POLOUS re: R/OCR

The OCR package is specifically marketed by Diamond Flower for use with
THEIR HS-3000 hand scanner. Since it is able to "read back" the DPI
setting off of the scanner (it goes 100, 200, 300, or 400 DPI), I must
assume it is quite hardware specific.
 However, the software is from a company that was co-displaying at Comdex,
and I have the info on that - you could call or write:
 Pattern Analytics Inc
 Robert M. Ray PhD President (Met him at the Comdex booth)
 3144 Merrianne Drive
 Raleigh, NC 27607
 (919) 787-8612

Msg 41700 is 06 line(s) on 04/18/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: STILLWATERS BBS LIST?

I understand Colby Jordan is now maintaining a BBS list, now that Sonka
no longer is. Anyone familiar with that list? Think it would be
suitable for inclusion in the CBBS low numbered messages instead of the
VERY old Sonka list?
 If anyone has it, who is also a Chinet guest, perhaps they could upload
it to my rje. Thanks!

Msg 41701 is 13 line(s) on 04/18/89 from BILL WOLFF
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/<$50 PC SPEECH SYNTH

Well Ward, I don't know how long it has been available for the PC,
but on Commodore Computers I have three of such programs. It sounds like
the Commodore type is more advanced. One of them is called HEARSAY
1000. Not only does it speak, but it listens too. Instead of typing,
you just talk to your computer.

People maybe thinking, hey that's the way to go. But the truth of the
matter is that, it's like talking to someone who doesn't understand
English to well. For someone handicapped, it maybe great! But to most
people, the newness wears off quickly.

Oh my cost for HEARSAY 1000? I got it brand new at $20.00 with demo
software and talking Terminal Software. Log-on and look Mom, no hands!

Msg 41702 is 18 line(s) on 04/18/89 from BILL WOLFF
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/<$50 PC SPEECH SYNTH

Another thing of interest to you Ward, another Speech program for
the Commodore was called S.A.M. It was all software driven. No added
hardware at all. It sounds as good as the hardware type. It was also
available for the Apple too.

The thing that might interest you, is that I took the speech synth prgs
and wrote a BASIC program to use a modem to answer your calls. Like a
answering machine. It recorded the time and date and printed it out
if needed. The cassette recorder was a piece of cake. Radio Shack has
this small box to hook up to your tape recorder and phone line. When
the modem answered the phone, the recorder automaticly started. I have
not even heard of anything today with all the features I packed into
that program. I never released any version of it and dropped any furture
work on it for two reasons (1) It tied up the computer, and (2) Some
people didn't understand some words it spoke. It's like listening to a
person with an accent. Once you got use to it, it was almost completely
understandable. What did I do next? I bought a dedicated machine.
It's called a ANSWERING MACHINE!
