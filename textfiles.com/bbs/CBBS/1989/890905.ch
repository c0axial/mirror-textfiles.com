Hmm. sounds like I am missing out on something. GeoLaser doesn't
seem to support postscript support as far as I can tell. Perhaps
some more info on this postscipt. With your regular word processors,
postscript meant that you entered codes for your formatting. Perhaps
we are talking about something different on the laser printer?

With GeoLaser, it only prints 75DPI on the HP LaserJet II. But with
an Apple Laser (or whatever the apple word for it is called), it
supports 300 DTI.

If I am not mistaken, isn't the HP LaserJet II only good up to 300
DPI? Or can this be expanded?

I believe Word Perfect only prints out to the Laser at 300 DPI too.
Also Word Star 5.5 the same.

thanks for the info.I hadn't realized that that was the problem.
One of our programmers also told me that WP may be hogging certain
video ports on the cpu that vga needs.so it may be an insoluble
problem. I'm running fine with WP on the vga and other vms on the
Hercules, so i'm happy. I wouldn
't recommend VM/386 to everyone, but it is nice for me because now
my machine works like I do, on three or four things at once.
right now i'm running WP at the same time, and can also start up
SYSTAT and run analyses concurently! (but, see Dvorak's column in
the latest PC Magazine-he may be right! Talk to you later.

Ward,
I sent the following message out on CompuServe (IBMCOM Forum):

 I would recommend that you definitely try out Prodigy. It is not
as zippy as BBS or CompuServe but this is due to the high use of graphics.
To see color you need EGA, but the monochrome CGA on my Toshiba 1200F looks
pretty good. The price is definitely right-$9.95 per MONTH -not $12.50
per hours like Compu$erve (as some spell it).
 Draw backs 1) little 3 line graphics ads on each screen-but you have
about that much in a magazine 2) slow response time-what do you expect
with PCs at 2400 baud and 8088/6 chips [I have to admit that the
"mainframe" used by IBM and Sears sure acts like a Commodore 64 acting
as a file server for 100 terminals, but lets give them a chance to
speed it up over the next year before we finally judge.
 The Prodigy kit costs $39.99 (mine was $42.69 after the state of IL took
their "cut") but this includes 3 months of free service. You buy it at
Sears. I wish that I could have gotten one of the free kits but I wanted
to get on-line as soon as I could.
 Finally, I do not work for IBM, Sears or have anything to gain from
your use of Prodigy. But don't criticize it until you have spent some
time giving it a try. There is a PC Club by the way.
The kit is returnable for a full refund within 30 days.
 ==================
 I got this nasty reply [I hope he isn't a SYSOP]

Brent -

I think your message is in EXTREMELY poor taste.

Most of the Prodigy discussion here died out shortly after
the service was introduced. The general conlusion was that
- due primarily to the very poor performance and meager
services offered - it was next to useless, and suitable
only for the rankest novice.

But more important is the sheer inappropriateness of your
unsolicited "ad", for a competing service, yet! Would you
walk into a Chevy dealer and procaim loudly to all the
customers present, "I think Fords are the greatest, and you
really should ought's try one."?!?!?

Do yourself a favor, and DELETE that message, before it
embarrasses you further.

there is KNCV48A. I sure wish that they would use something easier to
remember-like my phone # or Social Security #.

work for IBM or Sears but feel that they have a system for the common
man. My Prodigy # is KNCV48A [if you use CompuServe I'm known as

WeWard, you really started something here, didn't you?
Now FidoNet is talking about having 100,000 nodes in a few years.

(I must say, however, that there has been progress in the user-intce
area since you began.)

Msg 42430 is 18 line(s) on 09/03/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to TIM FAIRBANK re: R/THE FATHER OF THE BBS

Yep! I know there's been progress on the user interface. I nearly GAG
when I call a "modern BBS". CBBS' principles of "no centering, no lines
of dashes, no lines of *'s, no "cutesie" things, makes me nearly CHOKE
at all the "garbage" the more "modern" BBSs throw at you.
 There's a MIDI BBS in the Chicago area which I plan to call (for the
2nd time - now that I'm registered). and I had to force myself, several
times, to NOT just hang up on it for the ton of junk that is thrown at
the user. I guess an inexperienced user, willing to spend 20 minutes on
the phone and suck down several "K" of lines of asterisks, "pretty formatting"
etc will do well with the modern BBS's, but give me one like CBBS, or
Compuserve, which can "darn near" be kept from giving you any "trash",
and I'll prefer it a LOT.
 But then again I guess it is mostly a matter of familiarity - once you get
to know a system, etc, it can be more efficiently handled.
 One other think, was that that BBS didn't "respond" like CBBS does - to ^S
and other things - it was like driving an automatic transmission from the
back seat, rather than CBBS which I liken more to a sports car - including
the quirks. ;-)

You asked "Have you dc/d the bulliten (sic) board list?".
 Beats me, I hope not! What is "dc/d"?

Ooh, what you did was in poor taste - not your Prodigy message - for there
is nothing more useful than someone "talking up" something they like!,
but rather that you - I'm presuming without permission - took a PRIVATE
message to you on Compuserve and are "blabbing" it on CBBS. ;-)
 There have been discussions on Compuserve about private messages, and the
concensus was that the person made it (P) for a reason, and therefore if the
recipient would like to share it with someone else, they should get the
original messager's permission (but not a big deal).
 P.S. if the guy WAS a sysop, he'd have a 76703 or other "fairly well
known" sysop account (I'm 76703,302).
 Not to worry! If there's one thing about BBSs, it is the unfailing right
of its users to express their opinions, and for that matter to ACCEPT
feedback from others. Matter of fact, > I < would have jumped down the
throat (nicely, like I'm doing to you about private msgs) saying I was just
expressing an opinion, and blow away his "general opinion that it was
useless".
 Anyone who thinks that Prodigy is a competitor for Compuserve doesn't know
what it is. It is specifically NOT going to allow file transfers, for
example. I also don't think I'm going to be doing any grocery shopping
on Compuserve - at least in the near future - while I might be doing so on
Prodigy.
 I have yet to try my Prodigy kit - because I have a COM3: modem until my
it-was-lost-for-2-months-in-UPS 9600 external comes back. I > think < I
can just patch the BIOS area to put the COM3: addresses in where COM1 is,
and then fire up Prodigy. I'm just sad that my commo system has only CGA
(for who needs more for text applications) won't work well in the
graphically-oriented Prodigy setup.
 Stick by your guns! Leave a PUBLIC message to Blocksom saying you have
your right to express your opinion, and while I'd not use these words, the
inclination I have is to say "the majority be damned". ;-)

to ALL re: LPTN VS LPTN:?

Gee, I ran into a strange one Friday! I was installing the latest
software for a local are network with a postscript printer.
 When I copied a Postscript file from a user to the file server via
LPT2, it failed, causing the printer to have to be reset by copying a
null file to its adapter (EPT).
 When I copied the same file to LPT2: (note the ":"), it worked fine.
The problem was reproducable! Lpt2 always failed, lpt2: always worked!
 Anyone have any ideas on this? Might this be a bug in the local area
network software, which supplies the LPT2 intercept? Strange!

My 9600 baud modems have been found (one for CBBS). It was in an
obscure corner of UPS, due to some kind of UPS problem, the labels had
gotten unreadable, etc. Randy tracked them down and just heard from them.
 I apologize for the terrible line noise - at least I see it here a lot.
 Remember, CBBS has a "full line" editor ala wordstar, with word right,
word left, char insert (inserts a space, doesn't go "into" insert mode
though), char delete, etc. Makes it easy to correct any line you've gotten
botched. Use the "FULL" command at the command level. Also, when you
get into message entry, the "E" command will put you in this full LINE
edit mode, not just the old mode where you get to do character substitutions.

Sorry to but in but are you talking about the product from Berkley
Softworks. If so it supports 300 DPI when printing thru the serial port to
An Apple Laser printer. You should contact Berkley but it should work with
another Postscript compatible Laser printer when using serial ports.
I assume when you use the regular LJ it emulates a dot matrix printer with this
program and so 75 DPI makes sense.

Well, because of your message, I gave Prodigy a try today - it is OK!
 I had some problems, since my modem is on COM3, but I was able to find
where to put in a 1-byte patch so COM1: is really COM3:.
 So far, I'm pleased with what I see, but would MUCH rather be running
it on an EGA or VGA. My commo system is strictly CGA, because I've never
had reason to upgrade it - I have a VGA on a fast 286 for "graphics" ;-)

to WARD re: LPT2

Were you just using COMMAND.COM (i.e. "COPY") or some program that came with
the network? What's done at the interrupt level shouldn't matter as the name
is immaterial at that point. It's possible that the network is putting
LPT2: (but not plain LPT2) in its redirection list, with the result that
LPT2: goes out the network, but LPT2 doesn't get intercepted and is treated
as the local printer.

Are there any books on the market that would help a programmer to write
software that is Netware-aware. I want to be able to get various infor-
mation about the network environment, but I need these routines to be
directly callable from a Turbo C 2.0 program. If anyone knows of a list
of these functions, please leave a message to me here. Thanks
