Msg 42929 is 12 line(s) on 12/19/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: ATART PORTFOLIO

 Randy (CBBS Co-Inventor) is getting married Friday PM, so I decided to
buy him an Atari PortFolio. Quite a "cute" machine. It has built in
word processor, spreadsheet, appointment book, editor, etc. It is "command"
compatible with PC DOS 2.1.
 It arrived today (barely more than 24 hours from when I ordered it!)
 It is "cute". The keys are REALLY close, and while the QWERTY setup
makes it a LOT easier to type on than say a Wizard or other ABCDEF type
keyboard, the closeness of the keys means that - at least in the first few
minutes, you can't do much "touch typing".
 Cute: it has 32K, 64K, and 128K RAM cards, with a little backup battery
in them. You plug it in the side like a diskette, AND you have to - get
this - FORMAT A: before you can use it!

Msg 42930 is 20 line(s) on 12/19/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: PUBLISH-IT!-LITE

 I have PageMaker, and am a "publishing specialist" at least with regard
to Pagemaker and IBM's Personal PagePrinter (Postscript). But I decided
to go to the extreme opposite end, and buy a $40 publishing program -
Publish-It lite. Believe it or not, it really works! It has VERY nice
quality output on a simple IBM or Epson printer. It ONLY supports those
printers (as one printer) and the Epson 24 pinners. PERIOD. That's one
of the reasons it is "lite".
 It comes with a GEM interface, CAN work without a mouse (nicely using the
cursor pad, with HOME as 'click' and END as 'drag'.
 I found it quite UNUSABLE by me because my rather heavily TSRed environment
has only 485K free, and that gives me only 54K free, so the first document
(ascii) of any length I imported, caused an out of memory error (nicely
handled, BTW, by it saying "out of memory, save NOW!".
 If anyone has any questions, let me know.
 The basic way it works is to lay out boxes, then flow text into those
boxes. The boxes are basically the columns. Imports graphics also, but
very very limited kinds- .IMG seems to be the only kind. That is a native
GEM kind. Some other programs (such as - nicely(!) my DFI hand scanner)
can save in .IMG format. However, with my memory limitations, I baslically
can't do ANY graphics.

I got my fingers on a cross assembler package a couple years ago called
"CSC Cross Assembler Program" - it runs on my PC.
I converted the Z80 section to compile under Turbo C and have had good
luck with it. If the 8051 part of the package is like the z80, it's a
one-source file nonrelocatable assemble. If it sounds good to you,

to BENJAMIN COHEN re: R/COPYRIGHT HELP.

ALL I saw when ready the intros was that one two TOOLkits require
I put their name in the docs and one doesn't (ProBas). I am
running ProBas now since QuikPak Pro blew on a simple
thing. The specification in the tools (OBJ (ASM) fils) is just
the notification that some Companies tools are used. It is
onlt the COPYRIGHT info I was concerned about. Guess I can always
call one of the comapnies and find out EXACTLY what s done
on copyright forms (sounds like a good idea).

Eric:
 Thanks for the quick reply! I'm not familiar with "echos" on
Fidonet (though I have heard of fidonet), and would like to learn
more. I'll call your BBS after logging off here, and try to
muddle my way through. Please drop me a msg. when you get time
concerning specifics of fidonet echo
 From what you said, it sounds like the workaround involves
"masking" some addresses somehow.what do you think?
 Thanks again!

Msg 42937 is 06 line(s) on 12/22/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to COLIN SCHROEDER re: R/VIDEO BIOS PATCHES

An echo is simply a message area that exists simultaneously on several
boards around the world. It can be implemented on any BBS that supports
network mail transfers. When you post a message in an echo area on
a local board, it gets packed into a bundle that subsequently gets
sent to the other boards carrying that echo, and messages posted on
other boards in the echo eventually make their way to the local system.

Msg 42938 is 11 line(s) on 12/22/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to CLIFF SHARP re: R/8051 ASSEMBLER?

The Avocet cross-assemblers are really the standard, though they're a bit
on the expensive side. I use the CP/M version of the Avocet assembler running
under emulation (I got it when my primary development machine was a Kaypro
10, and didn't have spare funds to switch to the MS-DOS version).
There are some free or cheap cross-assemblers such as the PseudoSam
series, though they have rather non-standard syntax for assembler directives
and they don't directly support bit addressing (i.e. if you have a
variable in the bit-addressable area called FLAGS, you can't say "setb
flags.0"; you have to come up with the appropriate bit address in hex).
Not recommended if you're working with code that's already been written
or has to go to someone else, but if you're on a short string.
