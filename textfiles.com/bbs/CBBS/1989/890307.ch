You might try Henry Kisors BBS, It's really devoted to writers & writing.
You can apply for a password by dropping a line to him C/O the Chicago
Sun Times (he's the book review editor). The BBS # is 491-6995 but I think
you must be validated by mail first. It is an excellent board.
BTW, I find ita funny coincedence that you're a writer just arrived from
San Francisco. We have a friend of ours staying with us while he apt. hunts
and he's a writer just in from San Francisco.
Good Luck, Jim
