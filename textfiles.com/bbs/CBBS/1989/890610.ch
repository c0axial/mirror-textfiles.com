Does anyone reading this know of a way to take a PostScript language
page-description file and display it on an IBM high-resolution graphics
screen such as EGA or VGA? I am working on a project that needs this
capability and have already looked at "Freedom of Press" and QMS's
"UltraScript PC". Most preferably, I would like a hardware solution, as
time is a consideration. Thank you.

to ALL re: EXPERIENCE W/SUN?

One of the organizations
I consult for is tring to decide on a UNIX platform for manipulating
very large files (probably using AWK). The two machines currently
in serious contention are the IBM RT running AIX and the SUN 386i
running SunOS, which seem to be similar flavors of UNIX. The third
possibility is an IBM Model 80 under AIX. Here's the deal -
we need a relatively quick machine with 1 GB of storage. Does anyone
have any experience with such critters, especially the SUN 386i? It's
a cute machine, but once you get beneath the graphics (too cute),
how good IS it?

I'm wondering if you can tell me what I need to set up a BBS. This
would be used privately and not available to the general public.
Specifically : are prorams like the one used here available (if not
this one). What type of hardware is needed and what are the costs
involved in the complete setup. In Addition; what are the SYSOP
time requirements and what is involved.
As you see I have more than a few questions ! I hope that you can
help me out.
 Thanks

I have just been reading the advertisement for Megatronics Sprint Mother-
board for PC XT ->> PC AT upgrading. It seems fantastic - 20mhz @ only
100ns - and was wondering if anyone has any info on it - either from
actual experience or reading. I am interested in how compatible it really
is, I got burnt earlier with an DTK 10mhz board so now I research heavily.
any info - direct to me here, I'll try to PC Pursuit my way here again
soon. I heard so much about this BBS I just had to logon!

The hardware requirements for running a BBS are pretty much a computer
and a modem. For maximum choice of software, I'd suggest an IBM compatible;
from what I understand of your requirements, an XT compatible should
be sufficient. A hard drive is a necessity; unless you're going to
be storing a huge number of files, a 20 or 30 megabyte drive should
do. Your machine should have an internal clock/calendar combo, as
most BBS software uses the date and time and you don't want to be constantly
entering those manually. You won't need fancy graphics adaptors or
monitors; the monochrome graphics card and monitor that are often bundled
with systems should do. You can find package deals for under $1000;
you could do even better if you wanted to buy a used machine.

I would recommend using a 2400-baud modem, though depending on your
usage projections you could make do with 1200 (if, fr example, the
system's main function would be user-to-user electronic mail). However,
you're only talking about an extra $50-$60 for 2400.

There are a large number of BBS software packages available; call boards
using various programs and decide which one seems closest to your needs.
Many BBS programs are free.

As far as your time goes, for a purely private BBS you'll need to log
in daily to check for problems and you'll need to do backups. You
won't really have to be concerned about things like checking uploads
for legitimacy or messages for offensive language (things that take
up time on public BBS systems). Once you've got the thing running
smoothly, I'd say maybe an hour a day average (not counting caller
training time).

to JIM SACKETT re: R/INFO ON STARTING A BBS

Eric covered most of the salient points. I'll add just a couple of more
thoughts. First, take as much time as needed to find a program which
REALLY appeals to you. Changing over to a new system is a real pain,
and living with a system you come to dislike is worse. Besides checking
out the various systems used on public BBSes, you might skim through
catalogs from shareware/PD software outlets as well as popular PC
magazines, which often list software you can obtain and test for free,
or nearly so. Make surethe sysop utilities are easy and meet all needs
that you've planned for your kind of system. Lastly, be SURE to talk
with a couple of sysops who run the system on which you tentatively
decide. The first set of programs I used had bugs that cropped up in
devastating ways. (I didn't check with anyone!)
 It's generally wisest to get a VERY "Hayes-compatible" modem,
as BBSes have to handle a lot of unexpected rudeness on the part of a
few callers, and you presumably won't be around 24 hrs./day to reset
the system if problems develop. Again, you might check with sysops.
Personally, I'm now running a Supra 2400, which works admirably-clean,
reliable.
 While time is far less a factor for most private systems, you'll
need to make provisions to get the inevitable problems (hardware or
software) fixed very quickly.especially providing for times when you
may be out of town. The message-base files generally need to be purged (and
backed up) once a week or so. And even the best systems CAN hang and
need to be reset at least once in awhile.Relatedly, the sysop/sponsor
needs to allocate some funds for immediate repairs (and preferably back-up
computer and modem). Systems which are down for a period of time lead to
a certain amount of chaos and loss of users.
 Good luck.

IM IN NEED OF INFORMATION CONCERNING A BOOT UP PROBLEM EXPERIENCED BY A FRIEND
FRIEND WITH AN XT CLONE. IT SEEMS THAT AFTER THE RAM TEST, THE DRIVE WILL
CHECK THE A AND B DRIVES GO TO THE C DRIVE AND THEN RETURN TO THE A DRIVE
TO LOOK FOR THE NECESSARY DOS FILES TO BOOT THE SYSTEM. THE 20 MEG HARD
DRIVE HAS THE DOS HIDDEN FILES AND COMMAND.COM ON IT AND THE DOS PROGRAMS
THEMSELVES ARE ACCESSIBLE THRU THE PATH STATEMENT. HOWEVER THE ATTEMPTS TO
BOOT THE SYSTEM ARE MET WITH A NON-SYSTEM DISC, INSERT AND ENTER MESSAGE
THAT ARE SHOWN AFTER THE SYSTEM LOOKS INTO THE A DRIVE FOR THE DOS DISC .
ITS AS THOUGH THE C DRIVE IS BEING COMPLETELY IGNORED. NOW SO FAR IVE TRIED
RECOPYING THE SYSTEM FILES TO THE DISC. IVE ALSO TRIED INCLUDING A DRIVER
STATEMENT TO DOS IN THE CONFIG.SYS . iVE ALSO TRIED COPYING THE DOS DISC TO
THE ROOT DIRECTORY OF THE C DRIVE AND ELIMINATING THE PATH STATEMENT AS WELL
AS THE AUTOEXEC.BAT SO THE SYSTEM WOULD DEFAULT TO BOOTING UP AS SOON AS IT
WOULD LOCATE THE SYSTEM FILES. ALL TO NO AVAIL.IS THIS A PROBLEM CAUSED
BY A BAD ROM CHIP ON THE CONTROLLER CARD OR AM I MISSING SOMETHING. AFTER
BOOTING FROM DRIVE A AND SWITCHING TO DRIVE C EVERYTHING WORKS FINE. TYPING
AUTOEXEC AFTER SWITCHING FROM THE A DRIVE TO THE C DRIVE REINSTALLS THE PATH
STATEMENT AND ALL PROGRAMS RUN NORMALLY.GOD THIS IS FRUSTRATING. INCIDENTLY
ATTEMPTS TO REFORMAT THE HARD DRIVE ARE MET WITH THE MESSAGE INVALID DRIVE

Jim : It sure sounds like you have a problem with the system seeing
drive C. I am not sure if you have data on the drive or not but here
is a proceedure to set a hard drive up and have it boot from C:. You
can at least see if you missed something.
First boot from drive A: with DOS. At the A>prompt type DEBUG {press enter}
The system will return with a hyphen (-). Then type according to your
controller card one of the following
(Western Digital) g=c800:5
(Adaptec) g=c800:ccc
(OMTI) g=c800:6
 {ENTER}
Then enter the following to the next prompts
Press Y for low level format procedure
Current drive is C select new drive or RETURN {just hit return for C}
Current interleave is 3 . {just hit return}
Note interleave may be 2,3,4 or 5
Are you dynamically configuring your drive ? { hit N and ENTER}
Press Y to begin formatting drive C with interleave 03 (or 2,4,5) {ENTER}
This will begin low level formatting. When this is over finnally, Have the
DOS disk in A: and press any key to reboot
Next set up the DOS partition.
Type FDISK {ENTER}
From this menu select option 1 create a DOS partition. If you are using the
entire disk for DOS answer Yes. When it is finnished partitioning the disk
the sytem will reboot.
Now do a DOS format. At the A>{prompt} type
FORMAT C:/s{press enter}
The drive should then boot from C:. If you had a problem with getting back into
into a formatted hard drive make sure you are using the same DOS version in
drive A: GOOD LUCK Jim Sackett

Sounds like you screwed up the FAT. If you can read drive C after you
boot on A, copy all the important files onto the floppy. Then use
"fdisk" and check the hard drive. And make sure that is partitioned as a dos
and is bootable. Also check PCTOOLS to see if it has a way to repair
FAT. If that doesnot work you will have todo a low level format as the other
message says and start over. Sorry but it happens

The Turbo Pascal EXEC procedure was discussed on Internet a month
or two ago. A potential problem in using the EXEC procedure is
the requirement that you must explictly indicate the path of a
program to execute. The EXEC procedure does not automatically
search for a program according to the MS-DOS PATH environment variable
in Turbo Pascal v4.0.

You mentioned that you tried reinstalling the system files.
Make sure that you use the same version of DOS or MSDOS that
the hard drive was originally set up with. You can use pctools
to aid you in doing this. The two important ones are
IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM. You can also recopy ANSI.SYS and
COMMAND.COM if you want too. If you unhide the files with pctools,
make sure you rehide them again on the hard drive to insure the boot.
Also rehide them again on your floppy to make sure you don't loose that
too.
 GOOD LUCK AGAIN !

I once had that problem with an AT clone at one of my previous jobs. As i
turned out, the culprit was an inactive partition on the hard disk. SOm
all you'll have to do is load FDISK, select Change Active Partition. Them
Then select the partition that you want active. In your case, it will prob
probably be #1. You shouldn't lose any data in this process, but you know
what they say, 'Blest are the pesimists, for they hath make backups!'
 Hope this is a better alternative to reformatting the
 whole disk,
