to LEO ANGEVINE re: R/HELLO

Not too clear how midi can work in the context of classical guitar
(of which I'm quite fond).
 Midi is the hardware and protocol related to allowing sequencers,
synthesizers, and computers to all talk together. There are even
guitar midi pickups, but I don't know how well they "track".
 Synthesizers come in two basic forms - those with keyboards, and those
without. There are MANY different kinds of synthesizers - analog,
digital, "LA" (a new acronym I've not learned the meaning of - linear
amplitude or something like that), samplers, etc.
 Samplers are the most interesting - because they have "actual instrument
sounds" digitally stored in ROM or RAM, and they play them back. For
example, a Sax I have, is SO realistic - within limits - it has many of
the different tricks good sax player would use - grace note, falls, growls,
"breathy" sounds, etc.
 Typically, MIDI people have a computer with sequencing program, which
basically acts like a multi-track tape recorder, a rack of synthesizers,
a mixer, possibly some special effects boxes (reverb, etc), and a power
amp and speakers.
 For example, I have a sampler synthesizer, and a "rack" synthesizer,
the latter of which has 192 instruments, and is able to play up to 32
different instruments simultaneously, 16 DIFFERENT instruments.
 I had fun "jamming" a little acoustic guitar "spanish influence",
then adding some latin drums, and a few horns. Really quite fun.
 Playing the keyboard is an important part of a mini hobby, though for
example I have "keyed in" sheet music, had the synthesizer play it, and
from that, learn the notes and rhythm - then I start to play along on
the piano, eventually learning the tune ;-)

fnfortunately, I do not have the CD-ROM with the magazines on it, but
I'm working on it. It looks very interesting, even without BYTE (which is
probably a bit too technical for me, anyway).I understand about your
limiting your calls. I do, too - not because I'm in such demand, but
because I like to be able to pay my phone bills! If you ever decide to
drop by, I'll leave the number for you on Loren's BBS. I've seen your
name there every once in a blue moon. Running a board that's basically for m
messages is tough enough to keep up to date, let alone allowing time to
manage files. The CD-ROM keeps that to a very bare minimum. Bui]t, you
know what? I average 1 file download per day. My guys arf*e more
interested in talking up a storm, which is fine by me.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: LOREN'S BBS

Okay, guess I mixed you up with another well-known name (Phil Katz),
'cause you're not listed on Loren's BBS as an active user. Oh, well.
 This CBBS software is interesting. reminds me of IBBS on Henry
Kisor's WP BBS. And, actually, it sort of reminds me of Galacticomm
(which I'm not particularly fond of - guess I'm just an old-fashioned
RBBS-PC fan). The reason I like RBBS (and PCBoard) is the ease with
which the message base is accessed.
 If you're ever speaking anywhere about anything, I hope that I can
be there. I understand that you did attend the Chicago Computer Society
Sysop's Roundtable during Spring COMDEX - so I know you come out in
public sometime. Wonder if anybody is organizing another sysop
conference, on the line of the one a couple of years ago (courtesy of
Paul Bernstein maybe?) regarding sysop liability. I wasn't a sysop
then, although I was invited (but I couldn't attend due to a busyf*
work sf*chedule at the time).
 There I go again, babble, babble, babble!
 ck
P.S. Sorry about the line noise - but I'm not in the mood to figure
 out editing on this system.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/PC DATABASE - HIERARCHICAL

I have used PC-File (shareware) for quite a few years and it is very well
written and easy to use. There is now a PC-File db that requires a hard
disk. But I use PC-File + version 2. I know that it is "flat field" but I
would think that using the appropriate "code" fields you could sort and
get all the student reps at a given school for example. In looking thru
my shareware catalog I see that the "db" version supports 70 fields that
can all be "chained to other databases to give full relational reporting
capabilities". Up to 1 billion records per database-just in case you need
to keep inventory on spare parts for the space shuttle.
 Wampum would also be a dBase III shareware product. Call Public Brand
Software at 1-800-426-DISK for a well written catalog, describing most of
the shareware available. [No I don't get $ for this commercial.]

You might want to try SYGRAPH, a scientific graphics package from
SYSTAT, Inc. in Evanston. It will do just about any type of graphics,
with a little programming. On that note, I don't know how its ease
of use compares with SAS and SPSS, but I think its pretty easy.
One caveat: I work for SYSTAT, so its my job to know how to use the
stuff! Still, its very impressive, and the overlaid images you
mentioned are well within its abilitites. If you want more info,
you can call me or Leah Dorsey (our Sales Rep.) at 864-5670.

 to an empty screen (window?), the location of which is
 controllable via a parameter set from the calling HL lang.?
2. Allow editing of graphics files (i.e. a paint program callable

I may have just what the Doctor ordered. A while back I sent out for a
shareware package to convert some DBASE file written on a KayPro 10
which is a CPM machine, to IBM DOS format . The program worked great
and I only had to change some code from DBASE II to DBASE III format
on my IBM machine.
The CPM disk is read in and it writes out MS-DOS format ! You can't
ask for much more. If you supply me with an address or a board I
can get you a copy. If you want to get a copy else where I picked
up a copy from Public Brand Software 1 800 426-DISK
