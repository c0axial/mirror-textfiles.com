You said "No luck in uploading or downloading large files". Huh? This
is the FIRST time I've seen those words with respect to Prodigy. I didn't
know Prodigy HAD file UL/DL!

Msg 42642 is 08 line(s) on 10/19/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: PC: COPY NAME1+NAME2

Didja know you can append one file to another? For example, on CBBS I
append the current LOG file to the monthly log file (due to a bug in the
8080 emulator we're running, it adds a bunch of garbage (without losing
data) to the log file if it gets > 15K).
 copy L8910+log
 del log
This results in L8910 (the october 89 log file) having the latest log file
appended to it! Pretty slick. Sure surprised me that this works!

to RICHARD HINTON re: R/PRODIGY

BS. Prodige has been here since August. They have about 12 numbers, from
far south to far north to far west. There are SOME holes, so only about
80da [~s
80 percent of th efolk in the narea will be within a nickel call. There
are some demographic biases agains zip code areas with lower income levels.

Frankly I don't like the slooooooow screen writes that I saw at a demo,
but if you have a group that needs a lot of e-mail the 9.95 a month flat
rate could be a bargain (if you don't count your time as having any value.)

Downers Grove 515-8172
Geneva 232-9496
Joliet 744-7931 (area 815)
Maywood 547-1033
Chicago -N 404-0240
Libertyville 816-4851
Elk Grove/Chicago (????) 437-0213
 This is a funny designation. IBTCo says 437 will be in
 ea 708 come 11/11/89, so it ain't really Chicago.
Dundee 428-0061
Homewood 957-8016
Oak Lawn 499-0048
Northbrook 205-9200
Lake Zurich 438-1132

All are area 312 except as indicated Joliet is 815; come 11/11/89
all but the 404-0240 number will be area 708 (that is all the 312
numbers.) That's all the Prodigy Numbers in the area.

P.S. Watch the Chicago Daily Law Bulletin (huh? - there's a PC
column) next Wednesday for a free Prodigy offer (hint, hint, free
software and a month free usage).

 I need info on AT EMS. A guy has an old Everex Magic Card 16
with 2 meg. Need to get it to expanded and no software came
with it. I got Above Disk but the manual states it takes 78K

work?

Msg 42655 is 08 line(s) on 10/22/89 from BILL WOLFF
to ALL re: PRODIGY HITS 100/000 STRONG!

Prodigy has just announced that the membership has just topped over
100,000 members. They also stated that this is a record for new networks
start-ups. This maybe so, but remember almost all of the 100,000 plus are
living on a free temp membership.

So I predict that the beginning of 1990, Prodigy will set another record.
The fastest membership lost in history! Anybody out there who feels
differently? <BW>

Yeh, I'm afraid so. Course I'm afraid of a lot of stuff. Prodigy doesn{t
look likch to me. Another thing I'm afraid of is that stuck
on good boards like this one and compus. I keep a stock portfolio on
Compuserve and when I trird to replicat and the convenience it gives
me on prodigy, I was extremely disapointed with Prodidy's circa 1970
sort ofroach to on-line serv especially when Compuserve has been
so well for so long for everyone to see and emulate.

Msg 42658 is 06 line(s) on 10/23/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: PUTTING UP BBS

Gee, I've been asked to put up a BBS at work. We'd like one with
private email, distribution lists, conferences, and the possibility
of moving to multi-user.
 I've gotten recommendations from the author of the Searchlight BBS,
and one about "MagPie", and a recommendation about TPBoard - nice because
of the Turbo Pascal source - I will at least look at that.

to ALL re: AREA CODE 708 UTILITY

As a business which provides both computer and graphic arts
services, we're acutely aware of the challenges of the
forthcoming "split" of area code 312. As such, we've developed
a simple but powerful program which intelligently analyzes
data base (both fixed-length and delimited records) and text
files, replacing area code 312 with 708 when appropriate.
We're releasing it as a public service, asking only a small
donation to offset development time if it saves you, too, time
and grief. Copies may be obtained either of two ways: Download
from The Advocate/NOWAR BBS, 312.939.4411, 300/1200/2400,
8/n/1, 24 hrs., central Chicago (request validation or catch
sysop with CHAT) or send $10 for disk/copying/shipping to
Advocate Enterprises, Ltd., 899 S. Plymouth #504, Chicago, IL
60605. Available for MS/PC-DOS, with 'C' source included for
those who want to modify to their unique needs or port to other
operating systems. (CP/M version available from above sources
if demand exists.) Given the small "window" of time during
which this utility is useful, you're encouraged to pass this
message and the files along elsewhere, locally and otherwise.

to WARD re: COPY

sure, ya can even copy more than 2 files that way
copy file1+2+file3 file.all
A former bug in DOS (well I think it was a bug) used to
cause me grief
example: copy *.* \foobar
would copy all the files in the cuurent directory to a file
in the root dir called 'foobar' if the directory did not exist
or you spelled it wrong.
This lead me to get into the habit of always typing
copy *.* \foobar\*.* as a safety measure :-)

to ALL re: HP LASERJET IIP

Well, I sold the old HP Laserjet, and a few other things, took the money
over to Elek-Tek and plunked it down on a new HP Laserjet IIP. God, it's
a nice printer. My first impressions are all positive at this point.
One word of advice- the $995 price does not include the "optional" lower
cassette tray. Plan to spend $135 extra for this. you need it.
Without the lower cassette tray, your options are a little limited as the
printer will only hold 50 sheets in the "MP" (multipurpose) tray that
hangs off the front of the printer. Using the cassette, and the face down
output tray on top of the printer, you can close the door on the front
of the printer and the whole thing takes up less desk room than
your average 80 column dot matrix printer. Has 14 fonts built in,
plus all the character sets, including all the PC sets, will have a
Postscript cartridge Real Soon Now. Gee, I'm glad I didn't jump at
getting the deskjet.
