]Ward; Well I was flying with my instructor, on a review flight
(I was going to take my check ride for pilot license the next day)
we hit VERY nasty weather change (wind shear) near Aurora airport,
and crashed. I was in the hospital for 5 weeks. My instructor (and
friend) was killed, I was Very nearly killed, and VERY lucky to be
alive. Half a dozen surgerys later, I am recovering at my parents
(2 blocks from where Randy used to live). Will be a month or more
til I will be able to walk with a walker...I will be OK, but its
going to take a long time.

to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/3 1/2 " DRIVES

 The disks you're seeing are specified as:
 Single Sided Double Density,
 Double " " "
 " " High "
 I don't know what the first are for - perhaps the old MAC or something.
 The 2nd & 3rd are now also known by their unformatted capacity, i.e.
1M and 2M, formatting out on PCs to 720K and 1.44M. (1.4M?)
 The "coercivity" of the 1.44s is higher, so you SHOULD use the higher
coercivity diskettes at 1.44, but many people use the 720K diskettes and
format them to 1.44 - though I've heard of problems - most recently TODAY.
 (so don't put any "useful" data on a diskette of the wrong density,
I'd say). IBM started all this by NOT testing for the extra hole that is
in the 1.44M diskettes, thus allowing naive users to "by default" format
720K diskettes to 1.44M.
 Here's a "definitive" msg on the subject:

 Re: #147080-disk question
 From: John Rourke 76630,2337
 ==> Ward Christensen 76703,302
 I finally got fed up with being told this and that about HC 3.5
disks - so I called 3M, Verbatim(Kodak) and Memorex to get it from the
horse's mouth. The engineers tell me that while 5.25's DSDD are 300
Oersteds and 5.25 HC's are 600 Oersteds (higher coercivity), the 3.5
DD are 620 and the 3.5 HC are 650, which seems to indicate it is
possible to use 3.5 DD as HC. (The engineers say "We-e-ell, we can't
really recommend that")

backwards compatible with ALL current systems, including targa 16. It(the
 board I want) for about $2300. If i can get it, i will sell the vga card.
for much less then 200 buckeroonies. Please Call me by voice at the
following number for more info: (312)-698-3091 Anytime. Ask for Adam,
