to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM

The 'keep quiet' strategy is prevalent in the industry. So much so,
in fact, that PC-Week (I think) recently ran an editorial decrying
it! However, the cost of free upgrades en masse is prohibitive, so
few vendors do so. Microsoft has occasionally done it; I got a
free upgradde to MS FORTRAN v. 4.01 from 4.0. They just sent a
bunch of new disks w/ info w/o my even asking for it! This is
rare though. I hope your Fountain continues to bring you good luck!

Msg 42212 is 09 line(s) on 08/01/89 from ED FOSTER
to COLIN SCHROEDER re: SOFTWARE UPGRADES

 Most of the software companies out there don't do mass mailings of new
releases, but a couple of weeks I got in the mail an unsolicited disk of
replacement utility programs for PC Tools Deluxe. Since this is about a
$60 package, either Central Point is non-profit or there must have been
something really wrong with the previous upgrade.
 As a minor software publisher, I subscribe to the upgrade-on-request
policy. We mail a notice describing the upgrade, mention that it is free,
and ask users to call an 800 number. Very few of them do it. I hope that
doesn't mean the package isn't being used.

Msg 42214 is 23 line(s) on 08/02/89 from JERRY OLSEN
to WARD re: R/DTP FILES

Well, the program I've been marketing is used to fully translate word
processing files to files for almost any phototypesetting machine. It
has done that well enough that it is beginning make a name for itself
in graphic arts circles. Lately, though, some people have experimented
with a shareware copy on files destined for DTP environments and have
reported fair success even though that wasn't the original intent of
the program. What they've liked about it is that EasyType, unlike many
alternatives, <never> disregards any codes in the original file, yet
<never> passes through codes which have no direct typesetting equivalent
in raw form. (Instead, they're passed through in an easily-retrieved
"flagged" form for typesetter attention.)
 I have a strong interest in offering a version of EasyType
<specifically> targeted on DTP. Obviously, to do so I need to analyze
how various DTP programs store their data, and to compare that to various
typesetting file structures.And that's where my original request to
you comes in. I'm looking for a couple of files (along with a note about
the program and version of origin). In particular, I'd appreciate one
<very> simple, short file with an absolute minimum of "fancy" coding
(font changes, graphics, etc.). And then, at least one <complex> file
filled with such things.Together, this will provide a starting point.
Any clearer? (If not, I'd gladly chat voice to clarify what would and
wouldn't be useful.)
 Again, thanks.

Msg 42215 is 13 line(s) on 08/02/89 from JERRY OLSEN
to ALL re: DR. DOBB'S ARTICLE NEEDED

I recently released an MS-DOS "file-finder" program which, among other
options, offers a "fuzzy search" mode to find files when a user doesn't
sufficiently recall its name to locate it directly or with DOS wildcards.
Since then, I've received source code for a lengthy function whose algorithm
offers an excellent resource for expanding my program's feature.
Unfortunately, I have yet to secure a copy of the code's comments or the
discussion accompanying it in an article of last year.

Does anyone have access to the July '88 issue of Dr. Dobb's (#141)? If so,
I'd appreciate either a copy of the "Pattern Matching by Gestalt" article or
arranging access to the issue so I could peruse and return it. If you can
help with this key bit of research, please leave a message or call voice at
312.939.3300 (workdays, afternoons best) to make arrangements. Thanks.

Ward,
 I am giving serious consideration to replacing my PP2400SA modem
with a PP2400SA/MNP5.
 Would this cause any performance improvement with this board? Or
perhaps more importantly would this be incompatable with this board?
 Can you offer any suggestions in the area of setup strings to
configure the modem for maximum performance/compatability?
Sincerely,

to ALL re: 2ND FAN

Got fed up yesterday with the HOT computer. Installed a second fan
today MY way. Picked up a nice 120v fan at American Science Center
for $10.50, drilled holes in a circle like the phone "dial" and
screwed it to the side of the case by the HDs. Left the center
as a shield from the fan motor (nothing else between the HDs and
fan otherwise). The computer is running COLD now. Might get a
LITTLE static with these 1/2 in. holes but on an XT shouldn't
be too noticeable. Guess a 386 would wipe out the radio.

I just sent out upgrade notices to older users of one of my commercial
laser printre utilities. (TSR Download package.) I sent postcards cause
they're cheap to print and mail- 2.5 cents per printed card + 15 cents po
postage + 1 label. My upgrade costs $12.50 and includes new version of the
program, Perfect bound manual, plus a bunch of new utilities. I sent 114
cards last Friday and have gotten 10 piad upgrades so far. (Not bad for 1
week!)

I SHOULD upgrade now and don't have the foggiest about 386s. Would
a FAST 286 be wise at this time? I really only need about 70-80
meg HD and EGA-VGA monitor. If 386s allow memory addressing above
640K that might be wise other wise a 286 sounds better to me.
 I figure $2800 is a lot for a 286 and a medium price for a 386.
