to JAMES SCHMIDT re: R/QUATTRO-PRO

 The manual states you must have 3M of disk space, recommends 4M.
 I don't recall seeing any options about demos and tutorials being
optional. The samples take about 280K (with rounding to cluster,
that might be about 300K)
 One of the reasons they recommend so much disk space is the excellent
Bitstream fonts. I find that my originally-empty \quattro\font directory
now contains about 480K of fonts. Every time you produce a font of
a particular size, it creates it from the font outlines and stores them
in this directory.
 I did a rough DIR with all "my" stuff, and the fonts removed, it was
still about 2.7M.

Msg 42870 is 07 line(s) on 12/10/89 from RICHARD HINTON
to ALL re: RAM EXPANSION SPEED

I just brought up my RAM memory on a 286 from 1 meg to 2.5 meg and
everything has slowed down. Under one meg, everything went fast,
now it is snails pace. Many programs say they recognize expanded
memory, but really don't. I wonder if there is a hardware/software
fix for this problem. (I am using a software expanded memory driver
and a high memory driver for 64k of extended too under DOS 4,01)
Thanks.

Am using ProBas "now" and read in the manual that "if you can imagine
it, it can be done with ProBas". The graphics though is still tricky
in QB.

Msg 42872 is 17 line(s) on 12/10/89 from BOB SULLIVAN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/PSION ORGANISER

 Yep, they are thicker than I would like. My application:
Quick, portable data base and meeting reminder. My job changed
recently and requires me to remember to attend a series of meetings
in a variety of places. I set up an extra early meeting once and then
forgot to show up. At this point I thought I better experiment with
better organization.
 I went ahead and am trying a PSION for 30 days. My first one crashed
several times, and the alarm is to quiet in noisy rooms. On the other
hand it saved me from missing another important meeting. I don't have
to walk around with an appointment book this way, but I'm not
sure what the weight of the PSION will so to my sport coat pockets
over time.
I was just wondering if anyone else had experimented with this thing.
By the way,
CUCKOOS EGG is the best computer book I have read since
HACKERS and The SOUL OF A NEW MACHINE. Am I early or late in
finding out about this book?

P.S. I also like the PSION Eprom set up - expensive though.
Can you tell me anything about their new machine - for example, is it
smaller?

Msg 42875 is 08 line(s) on 12/10/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to RICHARD HINTON re: R/RAM EXPANSION SPEED

I assume that you mean that programs that use the services provided by your
EMS emulator have slowed down; if programs that aren't calling on it have
slowed down as well, then you've got purely hardware problems (did you
change the wait-state setting on your motherboard)?
If it's just the emulator that's gotten slow, it's probably because it has to
keep track of more memory, and on a 286, moving things to/from extended
memory is slow (even on my 386, a ramdisk set up in extended memory with
VDISK isn't much, if at all, faster than my garden-variety ST251-1).

Msg 42876 is 08 line(s) on 12/12/89 from JAMES SCHMIDT
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/QUATTRO-PRO

Ward,
 Thank you for the information. Would the FONTS you refer to be built
for Laser printers or for any displays and printouts. I have a dot matrix
printer myself but I do display charts on my VGA display. Would the
Bitstream fonts be exploited in this environment and therefore consume
the additional disk space?
Thanks again,
James

to ALL re: STARTING A BBS: NEED HELP!

Looking for reference material on starting a BBS. Tried to find Bowen's "The
Complete Electronic Bulletin Board Starter Kit," but can't{
find in CHicago - need it immediately for research. Any other suggestions on
on where I can find good, fast advice on hardware/software configurations
(e.g., how to size the hardware, software alternatives, etc)?
Please advise ASAP! Thanks!

Msg 42878 is 28 line(s) on 12/12/89 from JAMES SCHMIDT
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: IBM CORP PC BBS

Ward,
 I was reading a thread on another service when I came across a
mention of an IBM Corporation run BBS for supporting PC's. I called
thmber and was greeted with the official IBM Logo ( the one with
the horizontal bars) and was allowed to register and scan the message
and file sections.
 I also noticed that the latest DOS 4.0 CSD was also available
for download along this a special program for handling the hidden
files properly.
 I guess my question is twofold.
 1) Is this BBS really run by IBM it has an ALTANTA GA. areacode
 2) When did IBM policy change from equal treatment for all?
 I can remember some time ago you were explaining how IBM
 wouldn't make fixes available via modem as this would be
 considered preferential treatment for users with modems.
 I'm not complaining mind you just curious as to when IBM
 (if it is in fact IBM) had a change in position and what
 precipitated such a change?
 3) The phone number(s) are:
 404-988-2790 (Public Access)
 404-988-1347 (Accesser Registration)
 404-988-2778 (300->2400 Public Access)

 The first two lines support up to 9600 baud via Hayes
 Smartmodems (I think).

Thanks again,
James
