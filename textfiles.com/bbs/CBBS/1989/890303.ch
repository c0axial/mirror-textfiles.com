It appears you have been in the area for many years (given your user

Welcome to ChiTown. I didn't notice the weather getting warmer due to your
arrival - you must not have brought any heat from LALALand! Owell, I'm going
to 'Frisco then Houston, I'll bottle some and bring it back!
 Find out what exchanges are local to your calling area, then check the
BBS listings starting in msg 16. Also there are some other boards that
have more up-to-date lists - Dick Sonka, the guy who created a list which
we used, doesn't keep it any more. We should find a new source.

for the info and the welcome-sorry if I'm not using this system correctly
but I haven't quite got the hang of your editing functions here (TBBS I'm
much more familiar with). I certainly did >not< bring warm weather-in
fact the day the movers moved us in was the first significant snow storm you
had had (Feb. 4th).oh well. I had already downloaded msg. 16, but didn't
notice until later that the actual numbers were in 17-19.going to capture
that info now.again, thanks!.Kathleen

 I just received TIC from you, and I am using it as
I write this message. I have tested it; it works well.
Thanks! I'm going send the author his money. It is a great
deal, especially when I consider the alternatives.
 Your label reads Education Micros. Is this a club or
a company?

workshops and consult on computers in education. The disk comes from the PD
library I maintain as Public Domain Chairman for Illinois Computing Educators
If I remember (and I don't allways) aren't you in Educational Computing in
some way.

to CARSON PACKER re: R/LETTRIX WITH WORDPERFECT 4.2

I have had no problem with Lettrix with WP 4.2 & 5.0. The only problem
is that it slows the word processor down to a crawl. Works fine
otherwise.

Could you be more specific in the problems you are having.
