Sorry, John. We just copy the list. Like any creation, contact the
AUTHOR for modifications.

Welcome! I'm a Toshiba fan, myself. I "sort of" have a PC and XT,
also - though the XT is really the "PC Portable" goosed up with a small
(3.5") 30M hard drive. It is my BBS "compiling" system for those few times
I still hack something here (you've discovered this software by now to be
more "historical" than "modern", I'm sure). My PC is goosed up with
an 8mhz Bullet 286, 65M RLL hard drive, strange 800K 5.25" diskette,
etc.
 Howzit you have an apt. here in Chitown?

Yep, cleaning floppy drives <has> frequently caused disk I/O errors to
disappear. As you suggested, this has been a far more frequently needed
solution on my floppy-only machines. As far as I can recall, I've only
found that to be a solution on a HD-based system's floppy drive once.
And that was a few months ago on an '83 CP/M system on which I run a
BBS.i.e., 5-6 years in service. So, generally cleaning is critical only
on floppy-based systems. I do recall a kludged, 4-high-density-drive
Sanyo (after a lot of BIOS alterations!) was <<very>> finicky. Monthly
cleanings were almost a prerequisite to reliable use.

P.S. Just another reminder re the DTP files. That project now has slipped
down the projects list, but I hope to do some more on it mid-August. Sound
like a workable target for ya?

The "/E" environment expansion parameter which has been discussed is
indeed the general approach to take in such cases. You should bear in mind,
though, that if you need to expand the environment space a LOT, that space
can be passed on from "parent" to "child" applications and may begin to
represent a discernable loss of memory after shelling out a time or three.
Another alternative is to use one of several "change DIR" programs out
there which can equate each subdir with a character. Such programs also
often offer a number of other, related enhancement conveniences. One I
wrote will display a list of all subdirs upon request or if you enter an
unassigned change-subdir command. If you have more than one logical drive,
it also will let you change drive AND subdir with a command like:
CDX D:E
Such programs also are bundled with several "hard disk programs" packages.
If you'd like to explore one such program, a shareware copy of mine can be
found in C0:DIRUTILS.ARC on my BBS (specific program: CDX.COM). To contact:

Good luck.
