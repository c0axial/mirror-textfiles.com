to ALL re: NONSTANDARD DISK FORMATS

I need to code a program to read/write and format disks on an MS-DOS
machine for disks destined for (or received from) an MCS typesetter.
After a search through my reference library and trips to three decent
software-related bookstores, the best I've come up with is "this is
 specialized subject; consult a manual on the subject." Ah, that's
what I was trying to do! Any leads on such reference material (preferably
specific titles so I can have a store order it for me). Or, have you
had experience in such work and are you willing to chat voice about
it? (At this point, I'm less concerned about the specifics of MCS disks
than with exactly what's expected in terms of coding requirements.
But if anyone <has> worked with MCS disks, so much the better.) I of
course can pick up e-mail here. But if voice would be useful, either
leave your number, call me at 312.939.3300 (weekday afternoons), or
if you prefer to have me call you and don't want to make your number
public, pls leave me a msg at The Advocate, 312.939.4411 (300/1200/2400,
24 hrs.). Both phones are in the South Loop, Chicago, area. Thanx.

The list would be a good replacement for the SONKA list. They update it
monthly. At last count, they had about five sortings of the list.
The list can be downloaded (no hassles) from them at 769-4608, which is
Rogers Park or thereabouts.

The Stillwaters list has been uploaded to your files on Chinet.

Msg 41706 is 10 line(s) on 04/19/89 from GARY ELFRING
to JERRY OLSON re: NONSTANDARD DISK FORMATS

I've done some work reading and writing Alphatype Bertholder type-
setting disks and I think I did an MCS one. The best source for
information is the spec sheet for the floppy disk controller chip
in your machine. You may also run into problems with what an MSDOS
machine can actually do. The floppy controller chip in a PC is
incapable of reading Alphatype disks for instance. (As a matter of
fact only ONE floppy controller now made can read those disks.) If
I remember right MCS disks have some sort of copy protection in them.
Just find the part number for the floppy controller, and then get a spec
and application note for it.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: HASHING USERS (EH!)

Hi Ward. Well, on the hashing of users - gee I really dont know
what i would have done to it. I have it set up to where u have
to have a password to be able to log on and have made such changes.
What u have told me makes me wonder if somewhere down the line
its adding the "assistant" character to the name hex character add
up and makeing for interesting things. When a user first calls in
i have it write the users name in the log, but if it couldn't be found
it is written with the assistant flag written as a U. Then he/she
enters a 1-5 character password which i route throug the
hashing routine and write into the disk LOG. also, i keep the
original ascii password, then the hashed values written into
the log. this way, i can tell what the oriiginal password was,
and then when i find that the user is a real person (have had
a great deal of problem with the younger kids with the alias names
of each other and ME!) and then i go back in with find command and
add the V in the assistant flag position, and the hashed value
in the password field. Hmm. guess will have to take the time
to look it over. u want i should send you that part of the
pgm so u can see what i did??? (i commented it all). Byron Smith
