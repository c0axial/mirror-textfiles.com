Oh, Cute! That's a nice ^Z stripper.
 Have you seen the book "DOS Tips, Tricks, and Traps"? It is full of
little tidbits like that. It is one of those "Why didn't I think of
writing it" type books - but you'd be better at it than I.

 You inject ink just about any way you can - I fiddled with filed down
brass tubing, etc - a syringe, though difficult to obtain, is best. You
can also possibly make your own from things like old oil injectors, etc.
 You may wish to drill a hole in the top, and use an eyedropper to put
ink in, letting it soak in, then plugging the hole so excess evaporation
doesn't occur.
 P.S. there are other inks more highly recommended than my Pelikan 4001,
but I've had no trouble with that one. Unfortunately I don't remember
what ink was most highly recommended - I think Scrip, but not sure.

I'm a Sysop at the NOVA BBS in Annandale, Virginia using the OPUS system
on an IBM AT at Northern Virginia Community College.
I have a Mac+ at home (in Washington DC) and am interested in starting
a BBS there as well. Does anyone have any information, or leads to where
I can get information, as to what Host systems, (preference given to
Public Domain host), available on the Mac?
How about advantages and disadvantages to the competeing systems?
My Compuserve No. is CIS57,2262 and GEnie XTA12081.
Thanks for your help.

I have a 12mHz 286 system with award BIOS, which I am thinking

 Since you're on CIS, I think the MAC fora there are the best place to
go ask about mac BBSs (unless you find another mac based BBS whose software
you like).
 GO MAC - but from there, I'm not sure which fora are the best, you'd have
to choose by the names.
 P.S. is your CIS ID REALLY 57,2262? I've never seen that few digits
(or did a line glitch eat some chars?)

 Prodigy is a service of IBM and Sears. It has a graphical front end,
mandatory "supplied by them" commo program, and is generally oriented to
novices - many experienced BBS, CIS, Source, Genie, etc users consider it
quite frustrating. For example, I hate the fact that I can't use a normal
commo program with the ability to capture screens, etc - I thus consider
ALL MAIL I receive or send on Prodigy, to be "volatile" - for I will never
capture it to disk for later searching, etc. (I have a directory of all
my '88 CIS msgs, another with all the '89 ones, etc - and I frequently
search them for previous comments, etc).
 However, the price is good at $79 a year with no hourly connect charges.
 You can do "cute" things like see weather maps, etc. You need at least
an EGA to enjoy it - it is in boring B/W on a CGA.
 Some people like it a lot - I know one person who did most of their Xmas
shopping via Prodigy. I wouldn't mind checking stocks on it, but I've not
found how. (anyone reading this know how? Please REply to this msg).

 P.S. you might do "qr;1,prodigy" to get all the previous msgs about
Prodigy - there are dozens. Also, you won't see your own msgs nor my
replies to you since you elected to spell it "Pridigy". It is Prodigy, as
in "Child Prodigy".

Msg 42978 is 28 line(s) on 12/30/89 from BILL WOLFF
to JOSEPH SKOM re: R/PRIDIGY

Hi Joe;

Well the Prodigy people claim that you can't not compare them to other
on-line services because they are interactive services. While I am not sure
I buy that. They are different in a number of ways. First the cost from
Prodigy is a flat $9.95 a month whether you use it or not. You can't use it
from 12AM to 6AM in the morning. They have less local number than other
on-line services. For example, Wisconsin doesn't even have one yet!

One difference again is Prodigy has their own software and you cannot use
our own. It works only on MS-DOS computers and now MAC's. It uses the
graphic screen instead of ASCII characters which slows down the
communication very much. It also has advertisements on part of your screen
too. Nothing to get real excited about, as the most I have seen was about
30 different ones maximum.

The good news! It can and does display the nation weather map. It has a
national BBS, a EMAIL service, news, etc. It is fun if you are bored and
have nothing better to do. I think if one really needed one of the services
they offer, then it is a good deal.

Me I had it for 3 months and got nothing I really used. It doesn't even
have any files to upload or download. So take your pick! BTW, The Source is
now dead, but dumped their users to CompuServe! <BW>

BTW, I wrote this message off-line and there wasn't any replies yet. But
I see you have two already. Well I still uploaded this because it contained
information the others didn't! Take care!
