out of a board like Chinet.  Gad, I've not been there in a couple weeks.
__I got VERY tired of "general" - I think randy talking about Dawn being
drunk and him getting "lucky" - twice - was the straw that broke the
reader's interest.
__Wonder what happened to the 9600 modems?  They were going to get 24
hour turn-around a couple months ago but UPS lost 'em - but found 'em a
month ago.  Hmmm.  Need a tardis.

Be careful of that Prodigy modem - while it IS a Hayes, it doesn't have
all the programmable registers (such as time to wait for carrier) that
a "real" (or maybe I should say "full") Hayes modem has.
  Also, people have noticed more line noise with the "personal" Hayes
modems than with the more expensive ones.  A call to customer support
got a "What do you expect?" type of answer.
  P.S. are you sure it is not $149 for the modem? - though I keep hearing
different prices for different things - I thought it was $49 a year,
but that turned out to be 6 months - $90 for a year - not bad, considering
the unlimited usage.

Where were you 2 months ago!  I threw out a manual typewriter!
(sorry, I shouldn't have told you!)
  Actually, what I did was get one of the inexpensive electronic
typewriters from Service Merchandise, and a PC interface, so I
effectively have a Diablo-type daisy.  I quit using it (hooked to the
computer) when I got the DeskJet - but I still use it all the time
for filling out forms, typing labels and envelopes, etc.

Two printers at work act this way; an H-P Laserjet and I believe
the other is a Qume daisy wheel.
I forgot that I have a TSR prog. that can send codes to the printer
that might work.  I'll try that first.

The MIDI sounds interesting.
Would that work on my PCXT, or should I wait for the upgrade
to a faster system?
I'd really enjoy being able to be my own orchestra in the
confines of the apartment.
Hmmm-- maybe this is a separate computer system? Where does one
shop for a MIDI system?
Could I make a background of harpsichord or flute to go along with
my guitar?

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/TYPEWRITER

  I just threw out an old typewriter that was bad. Guess a "ball" type
will be best for "looks". Really only want it for labels. With a
24 pin I can do forms etc on the printer but those labels get to
me. Easy way to break a printer, changing the paper stock all
the time, especially with labels. Getting one stuck in an Epson
is a bummer! I just think how much it will cost to get it out if
I can't do it myself (quite often).

Richard, Don't know if you've seen the Oct. 9th Infoworld. On pg. 51 in Jerry
Pournelle's column he discusses the new Smart Label Printer from Seiko. It is
the size of a small telephone, holds labels all the time, has a special cable
so that you can hook both it and your printer to the same port and has TSR
software so that you write your letter, hit the hotkey, move a box that
appears on screen over the address, hit a key and out pops oyur label. It will
also generate bar codes.
Sounds like the thing for me .... If the price is right.

Sorry to hear about all your troubles w/ Disk Manager!!  I must say
I'm a little surprised, as I've been using DM on several systems
over the past couple yrs.  First on a basic Miniscribe 40meg MFM
drive, then a Miniscribe 110meg ESDI, and never a problem with
COMPRESS, CHKDSK, or any other program.  I'm using PCTools v 5.?--
I know it's not 5.5.  Do you suppose it's the SCSI interface??,
or perhaps the size of the drive??  Hmmm.......  Oh, well, I'll
not propagandize for OnTrak--they're certainly not perfect, and
they charge an arm and a leg for data recovery services.  I will
however, put in a potshot at DOS 4.x--I work for a software
company, and we've had trouble first with bugs in 4.0, and now
just with the size of 4.01.....it takes up enough RAM that our
admittedly RAM-hungry graphics app. often can't fit in available
memory!! I've been advising users w/ serious RAM cram to go
back to 3.3!!

Hi, you guys....
Have you ever heard about a disk drive called
           Computer Memories Inc.   model CM 6640  ??
My problem is that I cannot low-level format this drive on
my computer unless I can determine the number of cyl's and
heads!! Probably it is a 30MB drive, but I'm not sure.
I guess I've tried almost every drive type number between 1 and 40!
If you ever heard about the CM6640 or know someone who knows,
let me get a msg. from YOU.

  Just installed my XT into a baby upright. Looks real neat. The
problems encountered were a different power supply ($) and locating
the reset jumper on the board (still haven't found it FOR SURE). Have
to call about that jumper.
  I have to look if I can "hang" a 5 1/2 in HD inside if need be. There
is a slot for a 3 1/2 and a 1/4 height floppy yet. Only 2 5 1/2
in drives is a bummer for an XT. The part I like is I set the LED at
22 so it looks good!Who needs to change turbo from 4 to 8, just
leave it at 8. The supply and drive  hum real nice.
  The black face plates look O.K. on top of this case. The
real drawback is I now have the monitor closer and it is driving
me bananas. HAVE to rearrange this.
