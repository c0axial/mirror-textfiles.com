Msg 42880 is 23 line(s) on 12/12/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JAMES SCHMIDT re: R/QUATTRO-PRO

The fonts are for all the supported printers - it just goes to ALL devices
in graphics mode - that saves it a lot of trouble. I don't have an Epson
on my Q-Pro machine, but I'm going to see if I can specify an Epson as my
printer, then print to disk, then copy it to my Epson JX-80.
 It supports Epsons in 3 resolutions, and the results is surprisingly
good (I'm anticipating). Yes, the fonts would consume the additional
space "no matter what" - but again, only the ones you actually USE. The
font outlines don't seem to take all that much space, but the "generated"
fonts, which only happen when you do a hi-res screen display or actually
print, will take the space. You could be conservative by limiting the
number and size of fonts - but heck it is FUN to mix 6 to 24 point fonts,
with "cute" chart annotation, etc.
 Unfortunately, my font directory is now up to 3/4 meg itself!
 Ooh! I just copied 30K of a print file (binary) to my Epson - it is
OUTSTANDING! almost SCARY! Of course, terribly slow. You'd want to
do your prints "overnight", heh heh.
 You might do all your stuff in lo-res, then crank up hi-res and start
printing before you go to bed. Or if at work, start before going to
lunch or something. I can send you Epson output if you want, what I could
do is print-to-disk, then copy /b it off to my Epson via my network - lots
of trouble, but if you're interested - "OK". Or just GO FOR IT! You can
also print in text mode just like "old" spreadsheets, and can do the usual
"setup strings" (to put it in condensed, for example).

to JAMES SCHMIDT re: R/IBM CORP PC BBS

I dunno when things changed. There has always been the BBS, but I thought
it was more oriented toward clubs. The availability of a CSD is quite a
surprise.
 I wonder what organization supports it - was there any indication like
"National Distribution Division" (dealers) or National Support Division
(NSD = service) or Entry Systems Division (ESD, the PC folks)? It sure
isn't the division I'm in, or if it is, it is a well-kept secret.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/QUATTRO-PRO

Ward,
 OK I'm sold. I called Borland and ordered QPro today. I've been
sitting on one of those $99 certificates for a few weeks and you
convinced me it's worth a try. Actually I feel as though I'm collecting
$99 spreadsheets. I got SuperCalc5 last summer in a similar way but I'm
a bit dissappointed in it's speed. It's graphics are SUPER and it will
be fun comparing the two. Anyhow with these packages getting larger and
larger I think I must start planning for a Hardfile upgrade. The 20Mb on
this PS/2-30 is starting to fill up (again).
 On a separate note is there a difference in the 20Mb Hardfile
comes on the PS/2-30-286 and the one that comes on the PS/2-30-8086 ?
And if they are the same is there any reason the 30Mb Hardfile for the
30-286 couldn't be plugged into the 30-8086 to replace the 20Mb one?
I don't want to use up a slot for a Hardfile upgrade if possible and I'd
like to stay BLUE also if possibl~T~since I've got this machine on an IBM
maintenance contract I wonder what ramifications a upgrade would have?
 What do you know about these aftermarket hardfiles that have the
integrated controllers (IDE's I think). Do all the 3 1/2" have the same
form factor? Again I'm just trying to investigate options that won't
take up a slot.
Thanks for your time,
James
P.S. Sorry about mixing two topics in one message.

Ward,
 An update on the IBM PC BBS.
 When you establish a connection the BBS describes itself as:
 "IBM PC User Group Support System"
 Later on you get the LARGE "IBM" Logo followed by:
 "IBM National Support Center"
 Apparently the SYSOP's name is "Mike Austin".
 Maybe the IBM system can tell you what division he works for.
 Two nodes have Hayes V.42 Series Smartmodems running up to
 9600 baud.
 The first node is available only to those people who register
 and only for the distribution of OS/2 related information and I
 think the only file you can download is the latest OS/2 CSD.
 The other 2 nodes are available for distribution of all other PC
 related information including DOS, OS/2, PCJr . etc.
 There are message threads and up/download file areas available.
 Once again:
 Node 1: 1-404-988-1347 Registered users, OS/2 CSD only.
 Hayes V.42 Smartmodem 9600 series.
 Node 2: 1-404-988-2790 Public line all PC,PS/2,DOS,OS/2
 PCJr. etc. stuff.
 Hayes V.42 Smartmodem 9600 series.
 Node 2: 1-404-988-2778 Same as Node 2 except supports 300
 to 2400 baud only.
 Hayes Smartmodem 2400 (I think).
Sincerely,
James

Msg 42886 is 21 line(s) on 12/13/89 from BENJAMIN COHEN
to BILL WOLFF re: 4DOS

4DOS is a non-menu shell - it adds power at the command line.
You get aliases, extended commands, additional commands, a buffer
that can send keystrokes to programs, extended batch commands,
and lots more. Try DIR *2*.* to find any filename with a 2 in
any position. Option for two column display of DIR. Swaps out
to EMS or DISK (including RAM disk), takes only 5K of memory,
about 60K on the disk. Download the DOC files - over 100
pages. If you use DOS from the command line it's absolutely
invaluable! Try this:
 DIR *.COM *.EXE *.BAT
and get (separately) a listing of all the COM, EXE, and BAT files.
Try this:
 ERA *.BAK TODAY TEST JUNK
to erase all the BAK files and three other files not related by
filename in any way.

Or try this:
 EXCEPT (*.COM *.EXE *.BAT) DIR *2*.* /DF
to get all the files with a 2 in the name (the /F means files
only, no subdirectories), in the current directory or any one
below it, but not including EXE, COM, or BAT files.

 Has anyone heard much about the new TI chip that holds
40 seconds? of sound for replay? I think I read it cost
$2 in lots of one million. Also, some issues of Business
Week used the chips to sound off an ad?

Msg 42888 is 06 line(s) on 12/14/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to BOB SULLIVAN re: R/NEW TI VOICE CHIP

I don't know the details of that particular chip, but I have seen some from
Oki that do similar things (though somewhat more expensively). I'd guess that
the TI chip uses their LPC synthesis method, and includes a masked
ROM with the LPC data for the voice. The Oki chips use ADPCM which,
while not as memory-efficient as LPC, can be encoded at little cost
and without fancy hardware.

I have a 286 based machine and I am wondering what would expand the
memory capability and increase the speed too-(1) an Intel above

Msg 42890 is 12 line(s) on 12/14/89 from BRENT JONES
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/PRODIGY

I have been using PC Outline for over a year and a half. It is a very w
written program. It can be RAM resident like Sidekick and can show 9
windows at once. Actually you can both load it as RAM resident, then load
it the normal way in DOS and pop it up in two different sessions.
I really like it, especially for planning teaching outlines. I even use
it for most of my correspondence now, even though I have WordStar and
WordPerfect. It is neat to be able to pop up an outline while using
Lotus 123. I keep my to do list there.
 I heard about the Brown Bag business with John Friend. Actually, it
is easy to see that Grandview is "related" to PC Outline, but 123 is
related to the first spreadsheet program.
 Ward, what do you use Grandview for? Do you use the "categories" much?

Msg 42891 is 30 line(s) on 12/14/89 from EARL HALL
to BENJAMIN COHEN re: COMMAND PLUS LIKE 4DOS

 I've been getting settled in with a commercial COMMAND.COM
replacement called Command Plus. It, like 4DOS, can use EMS memory for
its buffers and transient portion. With that memory enabled, it takes
up about 5K of DOS memory and gives me command recall and editing,
aliases, directory stacks (remembers prior directories for easy return),
enhanced DOS commands and a block-structured batch language.

 I had previously used PCED (the commercial version of CED) and this
has all the features of that, plus the size of the alias buffer can be
up to 32K without taking up any DOS memory (same with the Environment
size). You can string multiple commands in the aliases and one alias
can call another. There are all sorts of abilities to use parameters
and environment variables in the aliases. And, if you SET ALIAS ON in a
batch file, the aliases are recognized there too.

 Their additions to the DOS commands are nice. DIR, COPY and DEL will
take Regular Expressions for the file commands and will take multiple
file specifications; CD can change directories and drives with one
command; there's a MOVE command and a BROWSE (similar to Buerg's LIST).
There's PUSHD, POPD, CLRD and XCHGD commands to manipulate the directory
stack and commands to accept characters and strings from the keyboard.

 That's just the normal commands used from the command-line and in
.BAT files; there's even more in their Script language (batch-like files
that have an extension of .S instead of .BAT). It's got FOR and WHILE
loops, CASE statements, BEGIN/END blocking, Integer and String variables
and a buch of added functions.

 For all this functionality I've gained in available memory. I've
got about 30K more available DOS memory now than I did before.

Ward,
 What you did will work OK except that I've found that the
cntrl-z EOF marker sometimes get stuck in the middle of the append.
I have a share-ware program called ADDTO that does it nicely though.
Whether the EOF gets stripped or not seems to be somewhat DOS version
dependent.
