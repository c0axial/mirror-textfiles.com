take time (as you can see) to master the variety of boards I come in

the message cursor automatically drop at a full line.  In the general

to ALL re: HAMFEST

No way! The Lake county hamfest was fantastic and a "must" to
attend EVERY year. Picked up a new 386SX board, power supply, etc. for
 $395.00 and, not only works great, but scores 16 on the Norton
test. Other super deals include a Weather FAX decoder for
25 bucks! So, the hamfest was, like last year, a total winner
for me.

Am impressed by the above expert system development tools in
terms of quickly generating complex expert systems. Building
several systems in each. Highly recommended.

Mike, Don't sweat it. If you're talking about the Apple version, I have the
both the software and the personality modules. I'll give you
a call as soon as I can get over there.

To save Ward a little work, I'll suggest you read message #42703, where he
explains why most mainframes can't handle XMODEM.

to BRENT JONES re: R/PC REPAIR

That problem sounds like an incompatibility between the drive and the disks.
I once had it trying to format high density disks {n a 360K drive.
You can't do it sometimes.

to JOE JESSON re: R/HAMFEST

 All I saw was a few computer related items at the Hamfest.
The Weather items were tempting but seemed to only be the start
of one heck of an expensive enterprise.
 I heard that the Hamfest were a lot better. maybe the showing
was kind of small due to the great weather so late in the year.
 One slow fest doesn't mean much, especially with that weather.

Could you tell me if there is a BBS that Randy currently logs onto, I would

to DUANE ANTOR re: WHERE RANDY IS

You left a message here addressed to one Ward Christianson asking about
the whereabouts of Randy. No one by that name (Ward Christianson) ever
logs on to this bbs. I presume you are asking about the whereabouts of
Randy Suess. He may be found on his UNIX BBS at 312-283-0559.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/CONTRIBS TO CBBS

Well Ward, It's nice to see that your area of concentration is on free e
of information. I've been browsing several Chicago area boards to find
homes. This is one of them. I have gotten some interesting comments and
read many more. I'm happy to be here. Now for a contribution. I was askin
around for a split screen editor. Among the responses was QEDIT, which i
as able to download to demo. I had a problem with loading two files at the
same time. This was cleared up with great detail by several people. I see
the importance of a forum of free exchange. Another valuable point is the
size and depth of the user base. You can sit and rot waiting for a
on Prodigy. It has some interesting points, and without it I wouldn't be
here via the sugestions left there by users who know you. I've scanned mess
ages on Prodigy daily since 10/18/89 fer Chicago BBS's are mentioned.
- - Now for a request for help. Does anyone have the toll free number
for the Mitral valve prolapse hot line? This was on T{ news last week and
I missplaced it! Thanks in advance. - - Mike - -

Brent, I'm still looking for PC OUTLINE to demo. I've checked into QEDIT so
far and would like to compare. Do you know where it is? - - Mike - -

Reply to msg# 42708 What good is Prodigy? If you had an EMail need you
ld organise a group leaving personal msgs around the country for $10/mo plus
the local access cost. That could get to be pretty cheap if you had enough
users that benifited from the content. - - Mike - -

to ALL re: UPGRADING XT HARD DRIVE

Our BBS has recently gone from an ST-225 to an ST-251. However, our
controller can't seem to agree with Disk Manager's driver on how many
heads the drive has. DM will properly format on all 6 heads, so the
controller is capable of addressing them, but the driver refuses to
acknowledge more than 4 heads. We're using an Everex 391, which I think is
a combination floppy/hard controller. Any suggestions other than spendin{
the $70 our Everex dealer wants for an upgrade to the controllerw3?

im wondering what step to take next. the problem only comes up when calling
naperville. any help with trying to work with bell to solve a line noise
problem would be appriciated. thanks mike

Msg 42732 is 08 line(s) on 11/07/89 from BILL MATTSON
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/UPGRADING XT HARD DRIVE

I don't know what an ST-251 is but I doall that an XT cannot address
more than 33 megabytes. Nor can it format more than 33 mb. That is what I
remember. Something to do wite basic operating system - the BIOS or
the BDOS or whatever (I may be mixing old terms here, but the fact remains)
I hope that's not the problem. Perhaps newer BIOS's can deal with more,
possibly when teamed with a newer HD con I'd sure like to know if
this is the case, and a good combo to use. I'd like more than33 mb in the
old honker, myself. Let me know3w. regards

 I'm not sure what you mean when you ask where to find PC Outline. It is a
available on most BBS that file sections of PC shareware. I got a recent
download on CompuServe, but I just wanted to get the most RECENT version
possible-it turns out to be the same as on most BBS. Since it is
owned by Brown Bag Software, you might find it listed as Brown Bag
Outline-it is exactly the same. Call me at 312/665-4462 if you need
me to mail you a copy on disk. Brent Jones

Msg 42734 is 04 line(s) on 11/07/89 from BRENT JONES
to BILL MATTSON re: R/UPGRADING XT HARD DRIVE

 A PC/XT can use a bigger drive than 33 meg. You just have to split
it into "hard drives" called C: D: E: when you do the partitioning.
 If you want to use a big drive like 80 Mb as C: only then you must
use MS DOS 4.01
I don't understand 'HOSRT', WARD
