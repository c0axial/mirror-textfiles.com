Sounds interesting! I just spent $725 for a 640K T1000 + 768K Ram card -
it is a VERY nice laptop, at about 6 pounds!
 The drawbacks are that the display is "very scrunched" so that the aspect
ratio is pretty bad (hard to play Nyet, heh heh), and that the processor is
only 4.77mhz, but it is not hard to limit it to, say, editing applications
that don't need more power.
 What are the characteristics of this "bargain basement" Sharp laptop?
(other than 256K and one drive). Is the drive standard 720K? 4.77MHz
processor? Dos 2.1? Others may be curious too.

Boy, I'm QUITE sure Prodigy is NOTHING like Compuserve! I think it is
a shopping and information access system.
 For one thing, it uses proprietary software to access it (not surprising
nor unbearable, for I believe it is VERY graphics oriented.
 As an IBM employee, I get to try it free for 3 months, and even buy a
2400 Hayes modem for $149. I got to see one, and it is "really funny",
just a "power plug" smaller than the power supply for a "real" Hayes 2400,
and 2 wires - one for RS-232 the other for the phone line! But it works,
though its small size (more likely, the small price) preclude having a
speaker, so you're blind dialing - not "too bad" for a special-purpose
setup.
 One thing though, they tell you that the modem only works with Prodigy,
but I found it compatible, and I think the sales people are just too naive
to know they should say "the software provided is Prodigy-specific but
industry standard software will work".

Ya, the 9600's are still out. Uh, actually, they're "lost". We have no
idea where they are. Doing a UPS trace on 'em now. I doubt Randy insured
them when mailing them, so they may be gone forever.

Heh heh, this software isn't "elegant", but it IS "a hack with lots of
strange bells and whistles", ;-)
 No, I don't "log onto any particular BBS of note". Just here, Chinet
(co-founder Randy Suess' big Unix board), Compuserve, and Gene Plantz'
board provide 99% of the time I call.

to ALPHONSO CARTER re: R/BACKSPACING WHEN TYPING

Please call me "Ward", not "zsysop" or "sysop". I never liked "CB-like
handles".
 I have NO idea why you cannot backspace, since CBBS has had backspace
capability which has worked perfectly for over 10 years.
 You must have a key you THINK is backspace, which is in fact NOT sending
an ASCII backspace (which is a hex or decimal 8, or "control-H").
 You also said "I cannot insert into a line of text also, please explain".
 Well, I can't imagine what you mean. I know of NO systems that allow
inserting "in a line" - except THIS ONE. Look up the FULL command - type
HELP FULL. It is a full LINE (not full "screen") editor, and supports
Word-Star like editing commands. It has a crude "insert", but it operates
by inserting a single space, not by going "into an insert mode". I use
it ALL the time, and couldn't get along without it (or at least wouldn't
want to).
 Hope this clears things up. (Hope there IS a "help full"!)

Sorry, this board is more PC oriented - check the msgs pointed to from
the logon to find other boards that might cater to the C-128.

We are in the process of purchasing a Macintosh system to consist of
a Mac IIcx, MAC SE/30 and MAC SE with 2 large mono screens. So far, the
17" E-Machine screen looks like the best bet. Any experience/though or
comments on Mac large mono monitors would be appreciated. Thaniks

You want to know about the Sharp 4501? Well okay, it is a 80188 CPU
running 4.77 and 7.14. Yes it comes with a 3 1/2 720K disk drive and
has room for another drive at a price of $150. To expand it to 640K
total cost is $140. Two other features that would be nice is a $89
COMM Port and a $200 CRT adapter. I got all except the CRT adapter.
Which I would like to get sometime in the future.

I herad laptops with LCD screens don't usually run CGA graphics
correctly. Radio Shack laptops I heard are bad for this. But this one
runs everything I throw at it. It runs all 256K min software, some
don't. So far I think it is great. I haven't recieved the extra RAM
or the extra drive, but I was in there for the serial (COMM) install-
ation. Everything is real easy to install. If you use a screw driver
you should do fine. The battery is a small lead acid 6 volt cell. So
it runs about 10 hours without upgrades.

The bad news is though I was told by Bill K on CFOG II that he checked
into the same model awhile ago and he heard SHARP was dropping the
models because of some defect. He didn't remember what it was. So I
guess anything could happen to mine, but so far so good. I got a
year warranty and used my American Express card, so that
means really two years right?

If anyone needs more info, I'll be glad to send it.

Oh yea, the book said MS-DOS 2.11, but I got MS-DOS 3.21. I tried
IBM-DOS 3.3 and it worked fine too. I have used both VDISK.SYS and
RAMDRIVE.SYS and they work fine too. {f you don't have a hard
disk then my feeling is use a RAMDRIVE if you can.
