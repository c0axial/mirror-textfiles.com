to DEAN ROGAN re: READ MSGS

When you log on, CBBS says to you:
 "Mine" command checking for messages to you.
Is that what you mean?
 The bulletin says that this is a BBS for CP/M, PC-DOS/MS-DOS, and Unix.
I suggest reading msgs 16-19 and finding a commodore bbs and asking your
question there where there will be fellow Commodore users. This isn't
the place.

Msg 41613 is 07 line(s) on 03/30/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to MIKE ROSE re: WORDWRAP

VERY interesting question! Word Wrap is available in the message editor
by EXITING input mode (i.e. pressing enter at the 1:? prompt) then typing
W to get wordwrap, the C to continue input (or w;c if you like shortcuts).
 To get WordStar line editing, use the FULL command. Unfortunately - and
I'm having trouble remembering why - FULL and wordwrap are mutually
exclusive. I use FULLC - a variation for my own preferences to line editing
chars (from the old WordMaster editor days), and can't do word-wrap either.
No msg 41614

to MIKE ROSE re: R/DISK LOGGING IN MS-DOS 3.30

For openers, I would remove FastOpen. (I thought it was neat at first,
but with cacheing, and having to reboot after SpeedDisk, I soon learned
I didn't want it).
 I recall talking about DOS not recognizing disk changes, but I don't
recall it happening in a long time, and I do recall ^C making it re-read
for example in my 2.11 DOS T1100+. I have cache in there, and it won't
even spin the diskette for some disk use, but if I ^C then it forgets -
that's prolly more of a function of the cache.
 You must have the diskette change line disconnected - but then again
you say it works under 3.2 - hmmm.

Ward, if nothing else, think they'd foot the bill for you and Randy to go
there and get it going again?<grin>

to MARTY DIPPEL re: ENVIRONMENT

Marty,
 If you want to keep your environment the you must find your
 PSP then goto offset &H2C to find the environments segment.

 If you need more help call me during the day at 805-497-8054

to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/QBASIC

I don't have personal experience with QBASIC, but the logic should
be consistent from BASIC to BASIC. The only approach which comes to
mind is to create the data in encrypted form, then return it to the
form you want at run-time by a "reverse-logic" algorithm. The approach
I would take is to figure out the logic to apply, write a little "data-
creating" program which would let you enter the data, then store the
encrypted data in an ASCII file. Then, simply read that into your BASIC
source code file. Obviously, your source code would, in turn, contain
the code to translate the data at run-time. A simple such routine could
be whipped up with ease. If you have <serious> security needs, you
might want to pick up a book on such algorithms. Good luck.

to DEAN ROGAN re: BBS FOR COMMODORE

You may want to try SYSLINK at 312-622-4442. It has its messages in SIG
sections and the one for Commodore shows a fair amount of activity.

Msg 41620 is 06 line(s) on 03/31/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to JERRY OLSEN re: R/QBASIC

 I have assembler routines for encrypting and didn't want to
include them in this pgm. Was think I would have to do something
like a home made encrypting routine. As long as the data isn't
completely readable I will be alright. Matbe even a substitutuion
of values will do. Maybe adding something to the ASC value.
Will see what takes the least amout of lines.
