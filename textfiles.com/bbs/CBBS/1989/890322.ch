Msg 41534 is 22 line(s) on 03/21/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: IBMAUX1?

This is a msg I'm sending to Compuserve:
 Help!
 I've just installed interrupts in the old CBBS routine, via the RS232
routine from the DLs here.
 Also, in order to support remote access when exited from CBBS to DOS
to rename files, etc, I use a file I got from a friend called
IBMAUX1.SYS, about which I have no further info.
 RS232.COM loads a resident replacement for INT 14, supporting an
interrupt drive circular receive buffer, and it works fine.
 Apparently, when exiting to DOS and running "command aux1",
comman.com does in fact go thru ibmaux1, but THAT seems to switch back
to the old polled INT 14, and I can't see how.
 At any rate, when I return to CBBS, the local console is active, but
the interrupt routine doesn't seem to be getting control any more!
 I'd appreciate any ideas on what I might do, as well as possibly
being steered toward any other options - i.e. other programs than
IBMAUX1 that might help.
 BTW, I checked the hardware interrupt vectors - they still point to
the routine; I checked int 14, it still pointed to the routine. I looked
at port 21, and it had the same value so interrupts weren't turned off.
 I am just stumped why the RS232.COM routine is causing CBBS to lose
remote control, while normal int 14 doesn't!

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/IBMAUX1?

 As far as the idea of alternatives to IBMAUX1, I have played around
a bit with FOSSIL (FIDO-Opus-SeaDog Standard Interface Layer) drivers
that I've found on various FIDO and/or Opus systems. They provide a
very nice substitute for the BIOS INT 14H routines, with a lot of extra
functions and I believe with interrupt-driven I/O. Makes it real easy
to jam together some quick C code and do a small communications program;
it took me about two hours to throw together something to count and
timestamp telephone rings by watching my modem.
 As far as explanations, could it be that COMMAND.COM is using its own
INT 14H cloned functions rather than going through the BIOS? Just a
thought, no other ideas off the top. good luck.

Msg 41536 is 15 line(s) on 03/22/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/IBMAUX1?

Why are you using it? As far as I know, its only purpose is disable
control-c's coming over the line, for use in "chaining" type BBS systems
where otherwise there would be strategic moments where a twit could hit
control-c and drop to DOS. There should be no reason to use it when the
only way to get to DOS is by authorized means (i.e. the only time you're out
of CBBS itself is when you've already used the legal and checked way of
dropping to DOS).

Your problem probably arises because IBMAUX1, being a driver, gets i
initialized before RS232, and probably during that initialization it capturrs
the default INT14 vector and modifies it to something local that ends up
with a call to the original vector. Then RS232 comes along and changes the
vector. However, when you invoke AUX1 and then leave it, it disables its
own changes by restoring the INT14 vector to ITS OWN IDEA of what the original
was, i.e. the vector as it existed at CONFIG time.

to BILL WOLFF re: R/CP/M BASIC COMPILER

MFDISK was a Kaypro-specific program for handling multiple disk formats.
It was bundled with a lot of Kaypro systems. There are apparently no
restrictions on distributing it, but it isn't useful on non-Kaypro machines.

Msg 41538 is 03 line(s) on 03/22/89 from SCOTT ANDERSON
to ALL re: MS QUICK C

I thinking about buying MicroSoft's Quick-C. Has anyone
experienced any REAL bad horror stories with the latest
revision (rev 2.0)??

Msg 41539 is 04 line(s) on 03/22/89 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to ED FOSTER re: DISK

I don't know WHAT paradox does to the machines, but it is so slow
running on a single-user machine that I wouldn't be surprised at its
slowing down the superstation. I think most of the slowing has to do
with disk access anyway.

Msg 41540 is 11 line(s) on 03/22/89 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to JAMES SCHMIDT re: R/41489

Hah! We located the bad chip (parity chip in bank 0) that caused WP
to choke. The reason that I think the same may be happening out there
with WP5 is that WP5 is an INTENSE memory monster, as is DOS 4. The
combination, put together with the marginal RAM that we've seen in the
past few years and the pressure for REALLY high speeds (often pushing
the suitability of RAM) could create the problems you're seeing. A
case of multiple personality problems.? The way to test this out is
to take on of these screamer computers, put in wait states and slow it
down to 50% of its rated speed and see if you STILLget the problem. ANd
yes, you are demanding more of your RAM when you change fonts, etc.
See what happens.

Msg 41541 is 06 line(s) on 03/22/89 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to KAYPRO OWNERS/USERS re: CO-POWER 88 BOARD

I'm trying to locate for purchase a Co-Power 88 board for a Kaypro
'84 series machine. Kaypro sold a number of machines such as the
2 +88, 4+88, 10+88, etc, that had this board in them. It could also
be added later. I'm looking for the 256K version, though I would
accept on with 128K. If you've junked your CP/M Kaypro, take a look
at it - perhaps I can make it worth your while!
