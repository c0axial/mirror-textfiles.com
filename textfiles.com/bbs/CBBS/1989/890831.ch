 You mentioned that WordPerfect and MicroSoft Word running on the Hercules
card seem to corrupt the VGA, and I remember that MS Word will use the
RamFont section of the Hercules Graphic Card Plus for specialized fonts.
The RamFont memory extends into the B800:0 normally occupied by a color
monitor, so even running in 'text' mode it could write into the color
buffer. That could be your problem.
 You might want to see if the use of RamFont can be disabled in the
program using the Hercules. Unfortunately, some commercial programs,
especially high-end WP, automatically recognize the Plus card and use
its RamFont capability. You might want to check the WP and Word manuals
and then call the hotlines. If you are a registered user, start with
the WP hotline.

CFOG's September meeting will feature a demo of Prodigy. Unfortunately,
the Library where we meet won't give a telephone line so it won't be
"in living color", but canned. There will also be some free software
and free 30 days of Prodigy service kits. CFOG members will be getting
a newsletter with a phone number to call to get the kit free if they don't
get to the meeting.

Reply to your message 8/23/89 : you fly planes, farm and call bbses?
That sounds very well balanced. I do pc consulting, play music,
and ride on airplanes. Most of my work involves database applications
run on pcs and/or local area networks. Most of my applications are
done in R:Base. Currently I'm investigating/evaluating/studying the
"client-server" database architectures. For pcs, the front runner is
probably Gupta's SQL Base line of products. The Sybase/Microsoft/A-T
product called SQL Server gets most of the press, but I've been talking
to some of the leading SQL Server evangelists and they admit it ain't ready
{to use. Today I recieve{ an SQL Server developer's kit, its BBIIGG!
Lots of books, lots of disks. Needs at least 6MB of RAM plus OS/2.

Lately I've been using the Microsoft Flight Simulator. I've always
wanted to hear a pilot's opinion on this product and on other pc
airplane programs. What aspects of it are realistic, what isn't?
What other programs can I get that might be better?
