Sounds neat! IBM has a board that will do that, too - board plus software
is probably >$1000!
 $101 whatever sounds great! none of my machines have any slots,
unfortunately. "Full up".

I can't seem to find that ref now that it is obsolete.

to BOB SULLIVAN re: R/BBS NUMBERS

I don't off-hand know about the <specific> special-interest numbers you
mention, but over on a BBS I run we have about 6 or 7 BBS lists, including
some fairly esoteric ones, which are all accessed by going to the operating
system level (C or J command from message base), then typing SEARCH and
selecting "BBS Lists" option. It's a powerful program with a lot of
options (allowing "ANDing," "ORing," etc., of search terms), so carefully
reading the help screens (or just searching for a single term) is important.
You also can TYPE the lists (all beginning with "BBS" as the first three
letters of file names), though TYPEing is restricted to only a few screens
of a file (enough to decide whether you want to transfer the file
to use on your system and free up the BBS for others). The BBS files are in
"GENTEXT" area after entering the operating system. Command to get there is
GO GENTEXT. One file, on law BBSes, is in a different area. Command is
GO A2: (I don't recall exact area name, but this alternative works fine.)
Good luck. The Advocate/NOWAR, 312.939.4411, 24 hrs., 8/n/1, central Chicago.

Msg 42104 is 10 line(s) on 07/16/89 from JERRY OLSEN
to BILL WODARCZYK re: R/MODEM PROBLEM

Eric's approach is a sound one.I might add that from what you say a
potential source of the problem if you're connecting OK once at 1200 but
then experience difficulty and this pattern is consistent is that your
modem program may be getting reinitialized (or sent commands it doesn't
recognize or can't assimilate fast enough) after the first call. You
might check the command strings sent before and after each call, and any
string which might be sent at the very beginning of a session. If you
suspect such a problem, look at what's sent at the beginning of the
session (when calling at 1200 works OK), and try using that as a lead-in
to every call. Good luck.

to ALL re: BBS PROGRAM

I'm looking for a IBM compatable BBS program which will run on a two floppy
system. I have wildcat , but I don't have a hard drive. I'm willing to give
cash for a copy of a program. If any knows about one please drop me a letter
 thanks!

to ALL re: WANTED USED PLOTTER 2 PEN

I am interested in buying a 2 pen plotter, even 5 or more years old
would suit me. HP or IBM brand or others. Also if you know of a
used equipment dealer in Chicago area, let me know. I have 12 months
to look for it, so there is no rush. Thanks, Brent

Msg 42108 is 06 line(s) on 07/16/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ADAM DADA re: (M) COMMAND

"help M" results in:
>>>> Modemming currently disabled (was little used, somewhat abused) <<<<
 This has never really been a file transfer system. Right now it is
even worse - modemming is "buggy" and crashes the system. Seems to be
more true since switching to a PC 8080 emulator. Even >I< don't modem
things in any more. Dunno if I'll ever find the bug or not.

Msg 42109 is 05 line(s) on 07/16/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to DONNIE STUHLMAN re: R/WARNING ABOUT COMPUTER STORE

There is a "cont" command. After entering a msg, you can save it,
then type "CONT" from the main CBBS command line. To me a "more logical"
way to continue a msg would be to send it to ALL as the first msg was,
not to yourself. Sending one on Compuserve IS more appropriate since
it would SAY there is a reply. CBBS is not that smart. ;-)

Msg 42110 is 10 line(s) on 07/17/89 from JOHN O'HARA
to ALL re: NEW ONLINE SYSTEM FOR JOBS

The Electronic Marketplace would like to extend an invitation
to all members of this BBS to log in FREE of charge to our system.
The system is called The online RECRUITER and it is devoted entirely
to the listing of job opportunities. To log on, you will need
VT100 terminal compatibility and a 2400/1200 baud modem. Here are
the phone numbers: 2400 baud ====> (312) 385-4447
 1200 baud ====> (312) 385-4475
The system is now available and contains live data. Feel free to give
us a call. This is a 24 hour system.

to JOHN O'HARA re: R/RECRUITER BBS

Is the VT100 emulation a screening process for prospects' slills? I think
I flunked. I only got readable screens once out of a dozen calls. 1200 Baud
seemed to be a different protocal completely. Why not plain old "glass
TTY" which is easy to match?
