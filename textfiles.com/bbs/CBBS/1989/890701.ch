to ALL re: CBBS DOWN/UP

CBBS's new USR 2400 modem had some problems - burned out some ROMS. USR
promised 24 hour turn around once we get it to 'em. Meanwhile, we're
running with a USR Courier 2400 which Randy kindly donated - it is his
normal "dial-out" modem.
 SO we'll put up a flash when 9600 is back again for those that dial
in at 9600.
 One reason for the extended outage was that the hard disk refused to spin
up after being down for a few days! (sigh).
 We hope to hang in there. Thanks to Randy for all his help. (For those
that don't know, CBBS is at Randy's house running on his hardware, while
I "run" it from 30 miles away).
 "tell your friends" CBBS is back up. Sorry for letting you down.
 We lost some messages - I reconstructed messages back to 04/01/89 based
upon the ones I'd captured to my disk locally - so some that have been
previously killed may be back up again.

to WARD re: CBBS HARDWARE

Glad to see it wasn't anything worse than that! I noticed CBBS first
down almost two weeks ago; figured you had some real problems -maybe
with the disk- so I'm glad to see it wasn't all that bad. You say it's
running from Randy's hardware. Has it been removed from the plywood
"breadboard" we've all grown to know and love, or is it that the
breadboard belongs to Randy? BTW, I'm getting a few line hits every
now & then; nothing serious, but a slight deviation from the usual
perfect connection. Could be just chance that I got a noisy line-
I don't know- but thought you'd appreciate the report.
I'm glad all's well with CBBS - thanks for the good work!
