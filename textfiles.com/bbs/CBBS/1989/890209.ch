to JEFF DELINCK re: CONTROL-S

Sorry, if we offered 9600 baud, I could see a "pause at end of page",
but even at 1200 baud, many uses can skim what they see and ^S when they
need to see something.
 At 300 baud, you should have had time to write down anything you need
(grin).
 Sorry, CBBS is quite "aging" - more "historical" than "friendly", and
I personally HATE systems that automatically pause every page - for they
to me are like a car that automatically puts on the brakes every block-
they "take the driving away from me". Seriously, I once DID take a cab
ride in Chicago where the bimbo driver DID stop EVERY BLOCK, and he was
on an arterial!

Msg 41303 is 30 line(s) on 02/08/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: TIME/TASK MGMT?

I'm interested in writing a personal time and task manager. I have done
LOTS of different things over the years: From "pocket notes printed in
5 colors", to an outliner, to pocket hand-written notes, to a small pocket
note-taker, to my latest: "my favorite editor" running on a LapTop.
 However, I'd like something more "Hyper-Whoosie" oriented - i.e. a way to
link to-does to a calendar, to link to-does to a phone directory, etc.
 Ideally I could see having a system powerful enough to contain full text
editing capabilities, so that whey you are supposed to "write a paper",
or "reply to a bid", it would be powerful enough to do so.
 I seem to have problems remembering to pinpoint activities to a particular
day - from "leave a note on blah-blah on CBBS when I get home", to "bring
in that latest public domain whatever-utility for Jerry at work", etc.
 I would also like to assign tasks some kind of "formula" from which you
could compute its priority. For example, a monthly report might have, on
a scale from 0 to 10, a priority calculated as 10/(32-days left). This
priority formula will be very flat during the beginning of the month, but
would rise to 10 on the day before the end of the month, and be "infinity"
at the end of the month. (I graphed it and compared it to the curve for
an exponential formula: 1.077^day as I recall - a figure which rises to a
10 when "day" is "31" - THAT curve has "too high a value" during the middle
of the month).
 Obviously a "how much EFFORT or TIME" is another factor, not just the
"due date", If something is going to take you an hour a day for 10 days,
then something should be sure you start it some time before the day before
it is due - i.e. it should rise in priority to force you to start on it at
least a week before it is due.
 As a "to-do" list manager, when I log a question coming from a customer,
it would be great to "hyper-whoosie" it to find previous calls, or, because
someone ELSE at that company may have called, "other calls from that same
company", etc. Any ideas, suggestions, appropriate languages, etc?

I don't know where or how to find a market for my services. I'm in my 21st
year as an IBM/Mainframe(DOS/VSE; OS/MVS-XA) Programmer Analyst. I cannot
abide another mainframe shop environment, I7d have a heart attack. My options
are: A PC Data Center Environment; a home versatile services environment.
Please help me any way you can. My voice phone is (312) 869-8597; or leave
me a message. I will call frequently over the next 7 days.
Thanks <Lee Hazziez>.

to ALL re: COPYRIGHT FORMS

 The Federal bldg. downtown has the copyright forms for software and the
tiny literature needed to go with it. Called and received the forms
the next day. Off it goes tomorrow. The info needed to enclosed with the form
seems simple enough. It's surely worth it for $10.

to TRACY LOSE re: R/XMODEM

You neglected to mention exactly what sort of programs you are downloading,
but if you have a file with a ".COM" or ".EXE" extension, just type its
name. If it ends in ".ARC", you need to run PKXARC.EXE to un-compress the \
file, then type the name of an .EXE or .COM file if you see one in the
list of files extracted by PKXARC. Hope that helps.
