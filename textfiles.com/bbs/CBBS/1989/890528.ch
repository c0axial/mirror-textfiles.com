]We probably are at the opposite ends of the spectrum, and
I simply don't know what to make of your comments - helpful
or otherwise.  Perhaps you're ticked off at the letters I
sent to IBM.  I figured I'd try, since IBM doesn't make any
more of this stuff and I've heard lots of stories about
junk laying around unused - a shame really when you consider
some of the wonderful things people can possibly do with
what is considered "obsolete" these days.  With a 64K EGA I
was given, why not use it to learn something about low level
video graphics?  With no IBM dealer really offering any
information, my only recourse was to write to IBM.  If you
are offended by this, I'm sorry.  I won't call your board
if this bothers you.  By the wording of your last msg, I can't
decide if you're being sarcastic or serious.  All of this has
soured any interest I had in this entire business.  I'd like
to forget it as quickly as possible.  Please don't send any
"official" letter.  It isn't necessary.  Thank you.  With
deepest regrets and respect, John Lin.

Line noise problems tend to go up with the line speed - but I'm
running 9600 right now. 'course, I'm MNP, but if there WERE noise,
(like I get on Compuserve at 2400) then there would be delays
while the modems "handshake" to get a clean "packet" thru.

You should be able to effectively swap the two drives. If there's one
long cable with two connectors on it, you may have to twist it a bit
(and you should check to see if either drive has a removable terminating
resistor pack. If so, it should go on whichever drive is at the far
end of the cable). If you have two cables, just swap them. Note that
floppies sometimes have two different cables going to the main board;
be sure to swap both of them.

Tell your friend that he can get his Kaypro repaired. For one thing Kaypro
is still in business, but barely. Try Palmerleu Computers in Hyde Park.
Call Antelope Freway RAS (home of the Chicago Osborne Group) at 764-5162.
for better information on how to find Pomerleu (obviously I'm not sure of
the spelling but it's near the U of Chicago.) Also Lillpute is still
claiing to be a Kaypro dealer. It's on the 4600 block of Oakton in
Skokie. Lilipute computer center. I can't recomend them, but you could ask
Pomerleu is well regarded.

Hey Mike;

That's the place "Lilipute" my friend is always talking about. He had
his Kaypro II repaired there once and I think it was like $150.00 to
change the "B" drive out. And I think that's where he wants to take it
back again. If you know something is wrong with the place, please let
me know. As for Pomerlue, that sounds like a nice place. Sometimes I
work at the U of C off of 59th street. But my friend and I live in the
far NW side of Chicago, thanks!

From what Jerry Olsen has told me, Pomerlau no longer deals with CP/M
Kaypros. I checked once with Lillipute, and they don't either. (Remember
that Kaypro makes IBM-compatible machines as well, so there are still
"Kaypro dealers" around.)

to BILL WOLFF re: R/VARIOUS MSGS

Pomerleau (correct spelling for a change here!) is at 667-2075. But as Eric
noted, last time I contacted him about CP/M Kaypro repair, he was quite
underwhelmed at the prospect. (His CP/M repair person no longer was with
him.) He is a very helpful guy, even allowing me to borrow a HD controller
to use for testing to confirm or deny that in fact that was the source of
a problem I'd had. But he really didn't want to take in the job.

If you do need to replace the A: drive, $150 is too much. It's a fairly easy
task. So 1) they shouldn't be charging that much and 2) you could do it
yourself if you're at all mechanically inclined and take reasonable
precautions. The tough part will be finding the old, full-height drives. :-)
If you try the latter, bear in mind what Eric says about terminating
resistors, though all you'll have to do in this case is mimic whatever the
removed drive's resistor-pack status is. And if you <don't> want to do it
yourself, I'd do it for far less than the mentioned price! 939.3300,
workdays. Good luck.

I develop and market a couple of phototypesetting-related programs which
have been used successfully in some DTP environments (though the products
don't officially claim such capability yet). I'm looking for a couple of
sample files from as diverse a collection of DTP programs as I can gather
to analyze and test, then revise my products as may be required to formally
release them as DTP tools.

If you can help with such files, kindly leave word here or, better, call
voice at (312) 939.3300, weekday afternoons (Chicago Loop). As a return
favor, I'd be glad to provide a registered copy of any products which may
be revised as a result of your help. Thanks.

P.S.If you're able to help and leave a message here, please note the program
you use and (if known) version number. The files needed are minimal-about
2 or 3, size unimportant-but hardcopies also would be required to indicate
exactly what the output <should> look like.
