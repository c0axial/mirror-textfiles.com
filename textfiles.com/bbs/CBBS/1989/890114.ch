to ED FOSTER re: R/RE-INKING

The reason I got a deal at $175 was that I had a $200 (surplus) Canon
ink-jet at my desk, then decided to get something faster. I put a note up
on Compuserve, and just waited until I got an offer - of $200 for a used
Think Jet (the guy bought a DeskJet). I offered $175, and got it.
 I looked at my cartridge - it has a little brass plug on the business
end, so I presume they've changed that to plastic. Ya, I think you could
"use a hot nail" to poke that thru (that way you'd not have any shavings
in the ink).
 I dabbed a Kleenex on my blue ink today, then watered down the half drop
on the kleenes, and it had an unbelievable amount of "blueness", i.e. I
think it might be a LOT more "color-densi" than just ink-pen ink. That's
prolly because this is a "special paper" cartridge. The plain paper
cartridge might have bigger jets "or something" and not have to use quite
such a "dense" ink.
 I have about 5 Think Jet cartridges, and that will probably last me a very
long long time - I print about 3 pages a day on mine at work. It is the
Desk Jet at home that does all my usual printing.
 BTW, tonight I did some Arts & Letters drawing editor and PageMaker out
to the Think Jet. It is kind of "screwy" because it requires the .92 left
margin (the DJ requires .25) but it "worked" for a single sign I needed to
make.

to ED FOSTER re: REPLY TO QUESTION ABOUT TEMPO

c
Dear Ed. They killed the Tempo column because . . . well, I don't
real know. The boss called me into the office, asked
me to "volunteer" to fill in for an editor. I said O.K.
Then I said, this will put that column I do in jeopardy.
She said, Yes it will, and walked out of her own office.
I think they didn't like it because the previous Tempo
editor dreamed it up, and they undid all his ideas.
My only consolation was that I was the last of them to go.
I no longer give a damn, anyway, so this is no great personal
tragedy. But yes, it was popular. The protest mail when it
vanished was quit heavy. I felt vindicated, especially when
they showed me what I know to have been no more than a third of
it. There is no fear like that of a bureaucrat, is there?

to PETER BIERMAN re: R/HAYES COMMAND SET

I'm pretty sure that the Hayes Micromodems for the Apples don't support the
AT command set (they were made before Hayes came up with it). Dialing,
going on/off hook, etc. are handled by CPU writes to various registers
on the modem board rather than by sending command character sequences.

for one, this computer had been owned by a sysop with
ton of bbs software, but i do not know how to properly utilize

two, all of the bundled kaypro 10 software is missing.
and three, i just blew out my perfect calc spreadsheet
software when i tried to abort during printing.
any help with these problems would be appreciated and if
necessary compensated monetarily.

to MIKE COOK re: ST-4026

To use the ST-4026 in your PC you first must upgrade the
power supply. The St-4026 is a big power hog. You can
use just about any controller with the proper set-up.
If you want I can install a power supply and controller and
set up your hard disk for $155.00 plus tax.
If interested give me a call at 830-4222

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/PGM HELP

I figured a bar choice WOULD be nicer. I have a subroutine for the
bar. With half the screen EGA graphics, I don't know what to
expect when trying ant fancy pulldown menus etc. I just have
a routine I branch to and add the text to the help screens. I
think I CAN manage the bar or alph-numeric choice combo. I would
probably only have to add a few lines per menu (that's 42 X 6 or 8)
and just branch to a sub to do all the work. A command line would state
how many line choices I have in "a" menu.
 After finishing up the data I will have to give it a go. It
really would add a lot of class especially with many choices in a
screen.

Msg 41156 is 15 line(s) on 01/12/89 from JIM REDMAN
to ALL re: MOUSE TEXT EDITORS

Why is the use of a mouse with a text editor considered worthwhile?
 I met my first mouse only editor recently, it's enough to give you
cramp in the right arm. What happened to the idea of keeping your
hands over the keys? No, you cannot point and click as fast as ^kb^x^kk
you'd be lucky to find the mouse by the time that you could have typed
this. Plus it's an analog device you MIGHT get the characters you
wanted, but then after that extra cup of coffee you might get those
plus half a screen! Now I'm not anti-mouse, don't get me wrong, they
are great for drawing, CAD and such, and they are great for the first
three times that you use a piece of software, no learning required,
but for a word processor that you use frequently the keys are much
quicker after you can remember them. The worrying thing about this
is that applications are appearing, Quick Basic comes to mind, where
only lip service is paid to the keyboard commands, do they assume that
no one can type any more?

Msg 41158 is 23 line(s) on 01/13/89 from CURT ROSTENBACH
to BOB SULLIVAN re: R/IIGS MODEM PROGRAM

The ProTerm telecommunications program is excellent for the IIgs.
I'd tell you who makes it, but I'm having a mental block at the moment.
It's either Central Point Software, or Checkmate Technologies, I think
Checkmate is probably it.

I know that you are a FORTH hacker like I am. Which FORTH are you using on
the IIgs? I have GSForth that I have played a little which, but since
I use LMI's URFORTH on the Compaq 386/20 for work, I haven't done much
with it. My fantasy has been to write my own FORTH for the GS. I wrote
one for the Apple ][, (a modified FIG Forth) but I want to make use of the
extra RAM in a manner similar to the LMI Forth that uses multiple 64K
banks for the code, data, and header information. I have also been
looking at the Harris Forth chip for design ideas. Since I have other
projects of higher priority I haven't gotten serious on the FORTH yet.

I'll double check the ProTerm information, but I know you will like
it for the IIgs. It supports text capture by file, and also has a default
"scrollback" buffer that used the available memory and can be reviewed
while online as well as cut and pasted to file, editor, or printer.
Supports Xmodem, Ymodem in single file and batch transfer modes, and
it learns keyboard and sign-on macros by example (which is really neat)
and you can compose your own macros as well as configure the system
for remote access.

Msg 41162 is 11 line(s) on 01/13/89 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to TRACY LOSE re: R/NEED HELP

Can't be done, as far as I know, since the TRS80 machines have a completely
different mechanism (to coin a phrase) than MS-DOS machines. You'd be
better off finding someone who is intersted in the 4/p and selling it and
then using the proceeds to pick up an inexpensive MS-DOS portable. One
other thing you could do - there should be FILE compatibility between the
machines (i.e., you can write something in whatever the TRS-80 uses as a
word processor, and call it up in whatever you're using on the PC (say
something like WordPerfect, etc). You'll need to figure out communications
between the two machines on a serial cable, and whether or not there IS
file compatibility (123 isn't likely to read the TRS-80's spreadsheet
files, for example) before you'll know if it's worth it.

 I use a mouse as often as possible. Probably because i don't
trust my typing! I mix both keyboard and mouse but DO appreciate
the "option" of the mouse. For programming it it great, I have time to thi

make a mouse ONLY program. Just like word processors. Some
