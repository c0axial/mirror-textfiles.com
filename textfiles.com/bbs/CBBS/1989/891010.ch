]Mostly for Alex, I suspect:
Been a long time since we've been in touch. Should voice chat sometime
soon...or maybe "do lunch" while you're down this way at work.

Specific request in the meantime: You've often U/Led the Chgo-area
BBS list over our way. Any chance you have access to the new version
and
pass it along one way or another? I'm fairly underwhelmed with the
idea of capturing (errors and all along the way), then editing the
sucker. Been the (delightfully) busiest period in a looonnng time.
So, while I'd like to get folks over our way the latest version for
use when SEARCHing, I'd like to do it the lazy way if possible <grin>.

to STEVE CASTLE re: R/XMODEM SOURCE FOR UNIX IN C

A few years back Dr. Dobbs ran an article giving C source for XMODEM

1987.

Msg 42578 is 25 line(s) on 10/06/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/360K PROBLEM

 The situation with ONLY formatting disk to be written to on the
386 1.2 drive is a bummer. When I do a lot of copying I format on 2 machines
to get it done quickly. I am hoping to get this debugged so I can SAFELY
send out 360K drives that can be read on other computers. At the
same time I don't want to rely on the XT as a backup that HAS to be
used for copying the disks to ship.
 If I have to keep sending out upgrades due to bad disks I will
go broke!
 I have to play around with formatting on the 1.2 and reading on the
360K. It didn't work at first but then again I am getting the hang
of it a little more now.
 Oh well, a minor problem considering some things that can go
wrong. The HD blew after about 2 weeks and had to have a new one
installed but NOW I can see that it was bad from the start. It had
the red light on where this new one has the green light on all
the time.
 Funny how even SEEING signs of problems go undetected mentally when
using something new. Realized this when a 40 meg blew on the XT. The
red light stays on. Think the XT was jealous and blew the drive to
get even!
 Last upgrade for the XT will be a new case. I got spoiled
already with the new 386 case and the Calif. prices on hardware makes
a new case look interesting. I heard the hardware prices in Ca. are
getting so low at flea markets that it is unbelievable. 80ns 256K
chips at $2.75 for example.

Msg 42581 is 16 line(s) on 10/06/89 from BILL WOLFF
to JIM SACKETT re: R/MBASIC TO GWBASIC

Hi Jim;

No thats not what I mean! I have a Commodore 128 that traansfers CP/M
to MS-DOS very nicely thanks. I also have Uniform too, which runs on
a MS-DOS computer and reads CP/M. What more can you ask for!

No the real problem comes that the tokenized MBASIC isn't the same
tokenized GWBASIC. Some of it works, but not close enough.

The real problem is to convert tokenized MBASIC to ASCII files (not
real hard, but I have hundreds of them) and it means loading each one
from BASIC and resave with "FILENAME",A option. That's a lot of typing
and waiting! I think a automated utility should work. A submit file is
an idea, but once in BASIC, submit doesn't work (or so I here).

Big problem huh?

Msg 42582 is 08 line(s) on 10/06/89 from JIM POLOUS
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: 360K PROBLEM

Because there are 80 tracks on 1.2 meg drives and 40 on 360K drives,
the magnetic path a 1.2 writes is 1/2 as wide. Because of this,
the 360K drive will pick up the original format and the new data when
writing to a previously formatted disk. The solution? Use brxDa
brand new 360K disks and format them in your 1.2 meg, copy them
on to 360K disks using a 360K drive in your XT. If you don't want to
use new diskettes, invest in a good bulk eraser or strong magnet!
(I keep a stash of new cheapo 360K disks on hand for copying to an XT!)

Msg 42583 is 23 line(s) on 10/07/89 from MARTIN SCHRADER
to RICHARD HINTON re: DISK MANGLER & BIG DRIVES

We use Disk Mangler as part of our product where I work, so I speak from some
experience when I say this: avoid On-Track products wherever possible.

Disk Manager inserts a device driver into DOS so that the normal device
tables are replaced by DM's tables. This, among other strangness that
DM does behind your back, causes such problems as CHKDSK refusing to
check a disk out. PCTools version 5.5 won't work properly with DM,
either - I found that out the hard way when I tried to COMPRESS my
300 MB CDC SCSI Wren IV. The compression seemed to be okay, but the
directory structure got hosed. I don't blame Central Point; COMPRESS
seems to work just fine on disks not accessed thru Disk Mangler's device
tables.

Also, the *only* way to do a complete, accurate "chkdsk" on a DMed
drive is to use another $100 product from On-Track - DOSUTILS. This
collection of crude utilities provides a disk scanning and error correction
facility, a deleted file recovery tool, and some other stuff. You
can't use CHKDSK, so if you want to do any kind of disk maintainance
at all, you gotta buy this puppy. Oh, well.

Look more closely at MS-DOS 4.01 (or better yet, PC-MOS from Software Link).

Am considering upgrade from monochrome CGA to ???. Would like your
thoughts on various alternatives and brands of displays and boards
Current tentative choice is NEC 3D + Video7 8-16 bit board (brand new)
but not sure. Upgrade flexibility is very important as my current
machine, an XT clone, will someday be a 486 EISA machine, so.
transferability of display, modem, and other boards is important.
This also justifies purchase of speed/functionality not necessarily
useful in the old XT right now. I'd like to hear from you a the
brands and co you have running and thoughts on the future. Price
is a relative concern as I expect to get 5 to 10 years use out of the
equipment I buy, as I have with this circa 1980 stuff I'm using now.
I do want at least super VGA ability in this combination, I think.

What's become of Microrim? I haven't seen an ad in any of the trade
rags or PC magazines by them in a long time. Have they gone away????
I have RBASE 5000 and RBASE for OS2, so I'm interested in their future!

Greetings all;

I know, your all saying now what about Prodigy! Well what else can I add to
it? I am sure you heard many things about it, of which many are true! But
how about some things you did know about it!

Ever hear of "Consumer Reports"? You know, that magazine which rates things
and then gives you the scoop? Anyway, they are on-line with them. Yes Ward!
Even your laptop is in there too!

You can do your banking through the service. I am not sure why you would
though. As this is only available at extra cost and if your computer or
phone line dies (like a bad rush to buy Cubs tickets) you can't pay your
bills! What are you going to use as an excuse to American Express? Sorry,
but my modem's been down for a month and US Robotics hasn't sent it back
yet! This by the way is a true story!

Other features like news and weather perks you up! The perk doesn't last
long, as there isn't that much there. Or you can spend your time looking up
users from your town. Not a lot of fun, unless you know somebody you didn't
know was signed up too.

If you travel and hope to use Prodigy, I hope it is California or something
like it. Because some states don't have a local line yet. I said state and
not city. To name a few, Wisconsin and Ohio are blacked out as far as yet!
Two states that I go to. Also Champaign, IL lacks a number too, but the
reps promised there would be a number soon.

One nice thing for those who signed up! You have 30-days to find out if you
like it or not. And within that time, they promise your money back!

I want to make sure I can use 360K disks in the 386 AFTER (if) I
loose/get rid of the XT. The 360K disk drive and controller should
work UNLESS there is a driver/card bios that is incompatible.!.!
 This way I can just copy files to the 360K and NOT worry.

 I used On Track disk manager on my XT before. I guess the low level
format is just fine but when the manager is installed, it causes the
computer to READ the DM code for each HD read/write ( I think) and it
slows it down so. a DOS with partitioning capabilities
is faster!

 I read a lot of message about the ATI VGA card (512K). I have had
the ATI EGA for some time and loved/love it. It runs ALL programming
languages where the Paradise is having trouble with old Basic stuff.
 I would buy an ATI VGA board if I did it again. As a matter of
fact if you want a Paradise VGA Plus, I will sell mine so I can
buy the ATI VGA board.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: PRODIGY KEYBOARD BUFFER

 If you're still using Prodigy (I gave up on it last night and
deleted its subdirectory), there's a file of auto-logon/fixes to the
software available. I uploaded a copy of it to Plantz' BBS, called
PRODHP12.ZIP.
 Besides giving sample .BAT files that include using KEYFAKE to
stuff the userid/password in automatically, there's a PROWIDE program
that re-enables the keyboard buffer. (It also changes 40-column
printing to 80-columns, but the fix to the keyboard buffer is why
I loaded it.) It almost made Prodigy livable for me, for a short time,
due to the improvement. But I realized today that I still couldn't
stand it and used it for the last time.

Thanks for the info. I'm not familiar with ATI. Do they have another
name? Where can I find it, local or mailorder? Regards

The "ATI VGA " board is advertised a LOT in computer shopper. The
price varies with US location. The ATI VGA with 512K is the one
you would want unless there is a newer one. The advertise in a lot of
the magazines and you can call them about info. I called long
ago and it was a Canadian call! That is the best way, CALL. You
can't miss the ads. it is "ATI" as a headline. The price is over
$200 but heck I paid way over $300 for my EGA Wonder board a way
back.

A friend is trying to add a second floppy (a 3.5" 720K unit) to his
Leading Edge Model M XT clone. He's using DOS 2.11, and apparently
some quirk of his motherboard makes upgrading to 3.xx difficult. The
drive he bought didn't come with any driver software. Is there a driver
floating around somewhere that he can use?

Interesting comments regarding Disk Manager.My own experience and that
of others I know is entirely the opposite. What version are/were you
using? My copy is v. 3.2. I regularly use CHKDSK with no adverse effects;
ditto for various other HD diagnostic and maintenance utilities. Either
your experiences are with an older version, or some hardware-specific
problems are involved. (I run on an XT clone with two 20-meg HDs from
different manufacturers.)

Driver.SYS should have come with DOS 2. If it did, he should put the
following line in his config.sys
device = driver.sys /d:1 /f:2

There is one situation where DM will interfere with CHKDSK; that's when you
use it to set below-normal cluster sizes. The DM documentation clearly
explains this. (for example, I have my D: drive (actually the last 9M of my
ST251) set for 1K clusters because I keep a lot of small files there. I could
have gotten it down to 512K clusters, but then I'd have had problems
with CHKDSK.)
