Did I meantion that it could be expanded up to 1.6 MEG. Yes you can
expand it to 640K and than get another 1 MEG for extended memory that
comforms to Lotus and MicroSoft's specs.

If you get everything though, I am not sure how long your batteries
will last?

The current (September) Consumer Reports discusses eight laptops:
Toshiba T1200FB; NEC Multispeed EL-2; Epson Equity LT; Tandy 1400 LT;
Datavue Spark; Datavue Snap; Zenith Supersport 184-1, and Toshiba
T1000. (Listed in order of estimated overall quality, based on
performance and convenience.)
 One conclusion: "Laptops can do anything a desktop computer can
do - but at twice the price."

Most likely, either you're using the "delete" key when you intend to
use the backspace key. Or, your terminal program is "mapping" your
backspace key to turn it into a delete key. If you don't have a true
backspace key which behaves as such, try pressing control-H as an
alternative.

to ALEX ZELL re: R/R/LAPTOPS

Well Alex, it's really no big deal! Most of the time, laptops really does
cost twice as much. I use to get Consumers Report for many years. And though
most articles were within specs, sometimes things seemed to be written by
someone who just learned about the product just last week. I guess that's
okay. But sometimes it seems that it can lead to the blind leading the
blind! Why don't they get better experts from time to time. Oh well!
Life is such . of well what can I say!

to ALL re: MILLS BROTHERS BBS

The Mills Brothers BBS is back (formerly the AMPRO4 board, formerly the
Mill RCPM, formerly the Mills CBBS (R) - in operation since 1982).
The BBS can be reached at (312) 690-3808, 8/N/1, 2400/1200/300 baud,
and is operational 24 hours per day. The Board runs on a PC-XT Clone
with a 60 Meg hard disk drive using "PC Board" BBS Software from the
Clark Development Company in Salt Lake City, Utah. If your computer
is set to display ANSI graphics, you'll like to colors.
The Mills Brothers BBS currently offers five download sections on the
"Main" board: PC Utils, Comm, PCMag, Pix, and Jokes. In addition, we
have (currently) seven "conferences" for various topics of discussion,
each with its own upload/download area: Ham Radio, Swap Shop, Talk/Chat,
Games, Program, Database, and CP/M.
Future plans include multi-user operation, on-line gaes/programs you can
run, and greater disk storage, and possibly even a worm drive or CD.
We are currently operating in "open" mode - give us a call.
 Jim and Jeff Mills, Sysops
PS: Recently up after some inadvertant downtime - give us a call.

Msg 42346 is 17 line(s) on 08/22/89 from JAMES SCHMIDT
to ALL re: 1701 POST ERROR HARD DRIVE

f*I have an IBM PS/2-30-021 (8086) with the built in 20 MB hard disk. This
afternoon I powered on the system unit and during the POST it displayed
a '1701 Error Hard Disk Problem' it gave me the option of pressing F1 to
continue which I did. The indicator on the hard disk came on solid for a
few seconds and then I was given the the option if inserting a diskette
to continue.
It appears the hard disk was not rotating. I powered the unit off and
then on again and this time the disk began rotating and POST completed
without error.
I guess my question is: Is this an isolated incident or is it a symptom
of a future failure? Do hard disks occasionally not power up correctly?
This has never happened before! The unit is almost 2 years old with
probably 2000 hours of use total.
Needless to say I did a full volume backup just to be safe.
Thanks in advance,
James R. Schmidt
