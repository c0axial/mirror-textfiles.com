Oh yes, the "recover" story. Surely the MST COMMON PC horror story.
HEY EVERYONE: ERASE the file "recover.com" (.exe?) from your disks -
you won't EVERY want it!
 ;-)
 That IS a good one I'd forgotten!

You might consider going to one of the computer clubs for a
"private" consultant.
 What kind of machine, what kind of skills, are you looking for?

to ALL re: NOT QUITE A HORROR STORY

I was out of town last Friday and Saturday and neglected to check the
answering machine long distance. When I got home there was a series of
messages over the two days from two people at the 20th Century Railroad
Club about an error message no one could figure out. The message was
assumed to be from the mailing list/ticket order program I had written.
The computer was (by good sense) left on overnight. The last message
Saturday was "Stan came in and said that 'Error writing to device PRN'
means turn the printer on." Happy ending. The young lady having most of
the problem is an MVS programmer and would have understood "Probable user
error. Fix and rerun."
I could probably edit some Hammond organ music into that and sell it as
a soap opera "All My Error Messages."

Msg 41643 is 10 line(s) on 04/04/89 from GRANT KILLEY
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/CONSULTING FIRM WANTED

Thanks for the idea but we prefer to stay with a firm so we have
a little bit shorter "leash" on the consultant (been burned once too
often).

 The basics are: porting 8085 asm and C to 68000, code is embedded
real time so I need people with real time and systems exper. Host is
MS-DOS for edit/compile and Applied Micro for emulation.

 Thanks
 Grant

Ward,
 Before you totally condemn RECOVER here is a legitimate use for it.
The following batch file will scrub (delete all files and
subdirectories) from a floppy diskette and do it faster than doing a format.
This idea was presented in a recent issue of PC Magazine:
IF "%1"==" GOTO syntax
FOR %D IN (A: B: a: b:) DO IF %1==%D GOTO ok
ECHO SCRUB can only be used on a Floppy Disk
GOTO syntax
:ok
ECHO | RECOVER %1 > NUL
DEL %1\FILE*.* > NUL
GOTO EXIT
:syntax
ECHO Syntax . "SCRUB d:"
PAUSE
:exit
:
BTW on IBM DOS 4.01 it's RECOVER (.COM).
