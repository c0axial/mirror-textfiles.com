to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/HARD DISK INTERFACING

The immediate application would almost certainly involve using an ST-506
interface, though I'd like to get technical information on the other
kinds as well. Information on board-level controllers not specifically
designed for the PC bus would be especially useful.

Msg 41745 is 06 line(s) on 04/30/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to BOB SULLIVAN re: R/VCR TAPES USA/EUROPE

Most European countries use the PAL standard for video encoding rather
than the NTSC standard used here. (I think France uses yet a third
standard). You'll need to get the tape converted; some video stores
can do the conversion for you (I recall a number of places in the Indian
neighborhood around Devon and Western advertise the service; I think
India uses PAL so imported tapes need to be converted).

Msg 41748 is 07 line(s) on 05/01/89 from KEVIN KEYSER
to ALL re: CP/M UN-ZIPPER??

Does any one know of a CP/M program that un-zips MS-DOS files?
My main interest is reading the many Zipped text files on the boards around
town.
Also, a C-128 native mode un-zipper would be even nicer, but I doubt that
one will ever come out.
 Thank's
 Kevin

Msg 41749 is 15 line(s) on 05/01/89 from CLIFF SHARP
to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/REPLACEMENT MOTHERS?

 DON'T try putting an eight-slot replacement motherboard into a five-
slot PC! I did and I may regret it when I get the nerve to try the
motherboard back into my eight-slot clone.
 I took my old 4.77 MHz clone motherboard (8-slot) and tried to use it
to replace the motherboard in my friend's 5-slot IBM PC. The physical
fit was very poor, but we shoehorned it in and plugged in the other
boards (multi-function, CGA, etc.) and fired it up. The board, taken
out of service while still working, did nothing apparent; the cursor did
a weird dance and disappeared.
 When we put his old motherboard back and restored the daughter cards,
it turned out we'd blown his serial port in some way (prolly one of the
1488/1489 chips but haven't looked yet). I loaned him my old multi-
function card and he's back to normal so far.
 As I mentioned, I haven't tried the clone board again since; but I
suspect that when I do, it won't work.

Msg 41751 is 07 line(s) on 05/01/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to KEVIN KEYSER re: R/CP/M UN-ZIPPER??

I'm not aware of one, though Phil Katz released the algorithms (but not
source) for the compression. Whether a CP/M version is even possible
would depend on the size of the data tables used; if they're greater
than 64K, forget it (if they're ALMOST 64K, then the C-128 native mode
version would be more practical, as you could put the data tables in
one segment and the code in another, or possibly buffer the tables into
RAM disk, with some loss of speed).

Msg 41752 is 05 line(s) on 05/01/89 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/CP/M UN-ZIPPER??

There's a CP/M program that will get you DIRECTORIES of ZIP files;
available on the ZNODEs in town. Also, there has been some word that
the ZIP algorithm isn't all that different from that for .ARC files.
I would expect to see a CP/M zipper of one sort or another arrive
within a month or two.

Msg 41753 is 07 line(s) on 05/02/89 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to WARD re: ORGINAL CBBS

I have a version of CBBS software (something like 3.6.1-I don't have
it in front of me) that I also picked up at Randy's yard sale. And
I still have two Shugart 800 drives that can read them.
I'm down in Bloomington with an old friend of mine, exploring
the possiblity of something permanent. (She works at Indiana U.)
I'll be in town until next Sunday, and will check back here around
then to see if anything's happening.

Thank's for the info, Eric. I do have a C-128 native MS/DOS de-arcer
So I am sure that a native mode unzipper IS possible, if unlikely.
.By the way, the RAM expaneer sure makes this a MUCH more powerful
computer.

Must I really write you a letter saying that we don't have any
EGA memory expansion boards lying around? They are still available
from "parts" (303) 924-4015, but you could buy a "clone" EGA for
cheaper than buying the memory as repair parts from IBM.
 If you insist, I'll draft this in a formal "from IBM" letter.
 P.S. if you're a different John Lin, "excuse me".
