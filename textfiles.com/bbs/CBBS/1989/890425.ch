to BOB SULLIVAN re: R/DISK LIFE

I haven't read anything, but I recall that in the early '80s, Verbatim
warranted their disks for 7 years. I _suspect_ that magnetic disks will
experience magnetic decay over time, but the problem should be much
less severe than it is with analog media, e.g., audio tapes. Since all
the reading drive has to do is to distinguish 1s and 0s, even a faded
signal should be readable. I'm sure there's been some work on non-
digital video and audio tape preservation; I'd use that for a guideline.
On the other hand, where are you going to find a machine capable of
READING your disks in 10+ years? Seriously, why not just copy the files
annually - keep two disks in each file, father and son. On January 1
of even numbered years, copy the 'father' to the 'son.' On Janyary 1
of ODD numbered years, copy the 'son' to the 'father.' In this way, you
assure that the signals will be 'up to snuff,' and you can detect
any problems long before they get serious. What are you storing, anyway??

to ALL re: EXTENDED MEM DISK CACHE

I'm looking to get a good "install it and forget about it" me
will use the AT extended memory between 640 and 1Mb. I read a PC Mag
review a few months ago, but I can't find that back issue. Anyway,
they all seemed to be in the $75 range, which seems a bit steep for a
simple concept utility. The shareware programs I've seen (Emmcache,
PC-Kwick shareware version, and the PC-Magazine Dcache) are all set up
to use expanded or LIM (Lotus/Intel/Microsoft) memory.
Any info would be good. I'd be willing to pay in the $20-$30 range for
a useful commercial or shareware program.
Thanks,]
Mike Ashe

to BOB SULLIVAN re: R/DISK LIFE

 I've seen it written that magnetic media of all sorts should be
recopied at least once a year to maintain reasonable integrity of the
data contained therein, whether it be audio or video recordings,
digital media, or whatever. I feel safest in recreating the diskettes
I have at least once a year, pain in the backside though it might be.
 Two of the problems I know of have to do with the fact that the oxide
particles don't keep all the magnetism imposed upon them forever, and
the fact that adjacent particles tend to "share" their magnetism over
a period in a sort of 'entropy' (this last is called self-magnetization,
if I'm not mixing my terms). This last explains the loss of high-
frequency spectrum in old cassette tapes, and its effects are greatest
when the media are used at low head-to-medium speeds.

to JIM POLOUS re: LAN STUFF

Sorry it took so lng to get back to you, Jim. We've been quite busy.
The list price on these Token Ring boards ran about $595 each. I think
we'd take $225 each for them (there are three still available). These are
the genuine IBM boards, and all are fully functional. We also have the
MSAU access "hub" unit, with the IBM connection system adapter cables.
This thing still goes for nearly $700, with the cables at $35 or so each.
We'd like $350 for the MSAU and all three cables, and I'll even give you
some of our cable we used to run the network (about 75 feet, w/ connectors).
The IBM LAN software goes with it and allows you to run it as a dedicated
or nondedicated server, with multiple servers, as a peer to peer network.
This is a good deal for someone to get Token Ring wthout spending a lot.
We find that our software products take us into other network arenas right
now. I'll be happy to discuss this with you. Call me at (312) 382-2305
9 am to 5 pm CST. Thanks.

]Ward, have you ever thought of adding a end-of-text marker to your
commands? (ie. a $) It could be used in a command format like:
r;*;$ <c/r>
this would read  read first unread message to last message in file
"
this would be better than "r;*;+;+;+;+;+;+;+;+;+;+;+;+;+;+;+"
