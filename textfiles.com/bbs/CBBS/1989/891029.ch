Well, the best contribs are just asking good questions, and trying to
help others - participating in the general message flow.

Msg 42674 is 08 line(s) on 10/26/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to PHIL JERN re: LJ II-P

What's an "EP"? Is that a cartridge? I see you "got by" at a good
price. I hate soft fonts- very tired of taking the time to DL them with
my DeskJet. Wish I'd bought "hard" cartridges.
 Is there a cartridge that would handle 8-14 point times roman and
helvetica?
 Mebbe I should go to ElekTek this weekend. The printer sounds great!
 Oh, BTW, I'd need the meg add-on, maybe go right for the 2 meg. I want
to do full-page graphics.

Msg 42675 is 02 line(s) on 10/26/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN

Sure 'nuff, "scanhelp" is missing. I'll have to shag down a copy and
modem it in. Thanks! <K>

Msg 42676 is 10 line(s) on 10/26/89 from STEVE COHEN
to LEO ANGEVINE re: REPLY

Leo, just saw your message from last month. Flew United last night
and althought delayed by bad weather/traffic, had a very nice flight.
Have been practicing MS Flight Sim and can land the Cessna smoothly
at most airports. I like to use the program to 'fly' around SF, NY,
etc. and with a little imagination its something like sightseeing.
Using a 386 with VGA is very smooth and responsive, even with the
faster Learjet. But the objects seem primitive and detail lacking.
I hear a new version (4.0) is on the way with the feature of allowing
you to 'design' an airplane and try to fly it.


Msg 42677 is 09 line(s) on 10/26/89 from DONNIE STUHLMAN
to KEN STOX re: GREETINGS

Hi! I just saw your message indicating that you still work for Bell Labs.
I don't know where Indian Hills is, but is it the same as the Bell Labs
in Naperville? I have several friends who work there.
I am now the LAN Adminstrator for the Illinois Student Assistance
Commission in Deerfield. We use Novelle Netware and a gateway to the
IBM mainframe sitting in Springfield. Within two months we will have
dial-up lines for our people to call in from remote locations.
I'm certainly glad that I don't work in a retail computer store any
more.

Msg 42678 is 06 line(s) on 10/26/89 from BILL WOLFF
to ALL re: PRINT TO DISK

I just tried out a nice PRINT to DISK type of program. It is called
LPTX700.ARC (48801 bytes) and runs in MS-DOS. A program that I really
needed for Prodigy. Interestingly it works fine. But Prodigy doesn't give
you that option very often. I also capture graphic screens with another
commerical program. Now all I need is a file section on Prodigy and this
may not be that bad at all. <BW>

Msg 42679 is 05 line(s) on 10/27/89 from PHIL JERN
to WARD re: LASERJET

EP stands for ElectroPhotographic.the piece of the printer that contains the
tone and drum.says in the manual that 1 meg add-on is sufficient for 300
 by 300 full page stuff, although that may not be the case if you do download
fonts. Rotating fonts to landsape mode also eats up memory. To be safe,
I probably would go to the 2 meg board. you can never have too much memory.

Msg 42680 is 11 line(s) on 10/27/89 from KEN STOX
to DONNIE STUHLMAN re: GREETINGS

Good to hear from you again after so long, I'm not on the BBS's
much these days. I'm happy to hear you left the retail business,
it's hell. Why do figure I work for Bell Labs these days ??
Anyway, Indian Hill is in Naperville, although I probably won't
know the names of your friends working here. There are 5000+
people working in this location. If I didn't know better, I'd
think that Naperville was in Northern New Jersey with all the
AT&T locations in this area. If you have access to USENET, or
ARPANET, I can be reached at (pick one :-> ):
stox@att.com, att!ihlpb!stox, stox@ihlpb.att.com, stox@arpa.att.com,
or att!k.stox

Msg 42682 is 03 line(s) on 10/28/89 from BRENT JONES
to ALL re: MCI MAIL

 Anyone using MCI Mail on a regular basis? Would you say that it is
cheaper than CompuServe? Is is very widely used? What is the most
widely used e-mail system? Thanks for the info.

Msg 42683 is 11 line(s) on 10/28/89 from BRENT JONES
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/PUTTING UP BBS

 I would recommend that you aim a EXTREME simplicity of structure
and easy of use. [Maybe the two don't go together well.] But I have
been showing some computer users some simple local bbs and find that they
are disturbed by the current BBS menu structures. Somehow they are just
not all that logical. Or perhaps it is the terms-a bulletin is not a
message on many boards. Or you can write a message to all but it isn't
a bulletin-those only come from the sysop.
 I am very interested in how your BBS turns out, Ward. In terms of the
number of people using a particular BBS software, I would steer you to
RBBS or the commercial version TBBS [I think]. The bandwagon effect is
significant.

Msg 42684 is 06 line(s) on 10/28/89 from BRENT JONES
to LARRY SHIPINSKI re: R/PC REPAIR 4 LESS

 A friend has a new computer which will not format floppies in the A:
drive. It is a 5.25" 360K drive on an AT class machine. The drive reads
but won't format-gives tract 0 error on good floppies. I can copy
from the console but can't copy from HD for backups. What to do to
diagnose? IBM advanced diagnostics? Disk technician?
 I'm at 312/665-4462 Brent Jones

Msg 42685 is 07 line(s) on 10/28/89 from BRENT JONES
to MIKE LADA re: R/PRODIGY

 An editor which has multiple windows-check out PC Outline. As share-
ware it is free to demo and cheap to buy. Supports 9 open windows on
screen at once. Outline features are top notch. I use it for all
correspondence. It will inport/export ASCII but native mode is non-ASCII.
You can make any keys do anything through a very slick macro feature.
 I like it so much that I'm shocked to find it-and outline products
in general-have few users.

Msg 42686 is 08 line(s) on 10/28/89 from JOSEPH SKOM
to ALL re: NEED ADVICE ON 976 EQUIPMENT

I am considering puting up a service on a 976 number that would require
some sort of equipment that allows the caller to select information via
touch tone. The system should also be able to record and playback
voice messages. More specifically, callers would call one phone line to
record a message and I would select 3 or so of those messages to be put
up on the 976 line for retrieval by callers. I would need several 976 lines,
and one message-taking line. My question is what would be the most
efficient and cost-effective way to set up this type of system?

Msg 42687 is 06 line(s) on 10/28/89 from BENJAMIN COHEN
to BRENT JONES re: R/MCI MAIL

There are differences between MCI maail and CompuServe that make cost
comparisons apples and oranges. For example, with MCI mail you can have
your message sent in hard copy if th recipient isn't on th system. And
as far as 'most widely used' what does that mean? Most subscribers?
Most e-mail mesages? Isn't the reall issue whether your target recipients
are on the system?

Msg 42688 is 02 line(s) on 10/28/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL

 I thought the first drive is a 1.2 on an AT. I don't know for sure
had enough problems with a 360K drive!

Msg 42689 is 08 line(s) on 10/28/89 from MARTY SILVERMAN
to ALL re: PCTERM EMULATION ON MAC

I am looking for either a public domain or pay for communication program
which will allow a MAC to emulate a PC type terminal. Specifically, I need
a program on a MAC that will do more than simple ANSI, I need to be able
call into a PC-MOS system (multiuser DOS) and have the MAC
emulate a PC termiaw3{nal program so that I can get the eight bit PC
character set and maybe even bit mapped CGA graphics in monochrome mode.
Any suggestions or leads on such a product would be most helpful.
Thanks in advance
