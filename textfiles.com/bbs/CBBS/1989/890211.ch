It probably should be pointed out to others who may be following this
topic that formal registration is NOT required to copyright a creative
effort (such as software). Doing so simply adds a few extra protections,
the most siginficant being the right to collect some additional fees if
and when (unlikely, for most of us) you ever end up in court. Registration
IS advisable if and when a program begins to become truly successful (in
terms of dollars), or in those cases where something really significant
or novel is involved, and thus has more likelihood of piracy. For most
smaller efforts, though, it's money needlessly spent, at least early on
in the process.

There are many advantages to ROM-based operating systems, but they won't be
practical until a given operating system completely stabilizes, which
doesn't look to be any time in the forseeable future.

Note that if a Commodore system is running GEOS, it could be susceptible
to corruption. Also note that the media say "virus" when they mean
"trojan" and any disk-based system is susceptible to those.

In theory, it would be possible to design a processor chip that could emulate
others in software; what you do is have the chip execute its microcode
out of RAM (microcode is the extremely low-level code that interpret's
the chip's instruction set. Most processors are actually running an
interpreter all the time!). This has been done with some minicomputers.

Another way to do this is to use software simulation on a very fast
processor. This isn't as fast as hardware emulation, but it often works
reasonably well. You won't get good performance simulating a processor
that'
s a contemporary of the processor you're doing the simulation on, but normally
you do a simulation to take advantage of software written for an older
(and slower) processor. For example, I can run Z-80 CP/M programs on my 20-mhz
386 with little speed penalty (works out to about a 2.5 mhz Z-80). I have
an 8051 cross-assembler that runs under CP/M and cost me $250; rather than
buying a new one or converting all my 8051 code to the oddball formats used
by the shareware cross-assemblers, I just run the old one under the emulator.

My meager legal understanding of registering the copyright is that besides
giving you a basis of claiming to be the author, it does allow you to collect
damages. The unregistered claim to a copyright gives the author the right to
stop unauthorized use, but he can not collect damages. Although a matter of
choice, some authors register everything as a matter of form (just in case).

Why not use ROM-based OS even if it isn't completely stabilizes. I left an
example that changing Commodore OS requires just changing a chip or two at
$16.00 each. I don't think that is too tough to handle. My EPSON PX-8 is
even easier to change, as the software comes on chips and takes a
micro-second longer than changing a disk. It uses a ROM-carrier that makes
handling safer and doesn't use much more than room than the ROM itself.

True Commodore uses a neat system of being able to switch out the ROM and
replace it with RAM. There are programs that copies ROM to RAM and then
you can modify it for your needs. As you mentioned, GEOS is a new
operating system that is disk based, using Commodore's option of switching
out the ROM and putting in your own. Although I am a big GEOS fan, I think
they made a big mistake by using copy protection on their boot disk. They
also only give you two copies too. If both go, you can't boot up. Also as
you mentioned, yes a virus can infect both disks then what? I have used
copy buster programs on the boot disks, but Berkeley Softworks (maker of
GEOS) have been clever enough to make something not work right if done. So
back to the orginial I go.

GEOS has considered going to ROM and using a Commodore this is possible to
have more ROMs installed. The C128 has an empty socket just for this. Some
software uses this and to use it, they let you boot up with it like
holding down a key when booting up. The C64 or C128 can also use the
expansion port too to use other ROM based operating system. Allot of games
and utilities came this way.

Although faster CPU's are neat, they ussually have more instructions and
in fact makes them less efficient than slower types, as they use less
instructions. Most of the extra instructions are ussually seldom used any
way. I believe a 8502 8-bit, 2 MHZ CPU runs a computer almost as fast as a
80286 CPU in real life. Or is it because Commodore uses other CPU's to
handle other things like video and ports and the like?

Oh I can't find it now. but I just read somewhere that others feel the
same way I do. In fact a new CPU that uses this idea is called I think
N-10, or NX-10 or something like this. I think Intel bought the rights
from someone. And designers are eager to use it.

 What machine are you going to install this critter in?
 I'm current shopping for a 386, and this controller sounds
like the hot setup.
 How about a progrss report once you get it in.
 Tnx in advance.

 I read a file on copyrighting and hope I did it O.K. I put page
numbers on and skipped perfs. If it is wrong I will find out is 1-3 months.

 A carton company will probably be my best bet. That cuts out the
middle man and his profits. Should be able to get a bulk order. Havr
bought direct from many places in Chicago just by walking in. Will
call the beginning of the week.

 I would consider ANY program that is a NEW idea and the first of
it's kind (what it does) to be copyrighted no matter how small
it is. At least you have the possibility to SELL it and make
money easy. That is sell the copyright.

 MEI has cheap disks (which I wont get anymore, cheap name brands
format better) and their prices should be able to be beaten easily
in bulk order. Places seem eager to sell outright, guess it cuts out
the salesperson's commission thru the office. Hope it is easy by
phone as in person. I was looking for 5 1/2 x 5 1/2 inch cardboard
also for disks enclosed in padded envelopes with the whole program
package. My first program is starting off, and maybe my latest will
do better SOON. Picked up padded envelopes (#5) at $26/100 at
Arveys. Can't beat that price anywhere. These prices make
large purchases worthwhile. Everyone is selling disks but
noone has the stuff for mailing them! It adds up to plenty when I
but a few packages of mailers at a time, enough to make me want
to have a LONG supply on hand from a bulk order. Really no
room to store them but will just stack them and put a cloth over
the boxes, hehe.
