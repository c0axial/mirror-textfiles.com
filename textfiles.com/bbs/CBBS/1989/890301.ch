I'd most surely appreciate the disk; getting reimbursed for phone calls
is one of my least favorite activities ("what do you mean you called a
BBS in Dayton!?") So if you'll send the disk to: Andrew Marchant
Shapiro, 5110 S Kenwood #309, Chicago IL 60615, I would really thank
you. I'd also return the disk full of PD software for your trouble.
10NET's documentation - at least as far as I can see - seems to be
of the obscure variety. But then again, so is the Paradox documentation,
so who knows? Anyway, thanks for the help!

to ALL re: HELLO!

Just arrived in Chicagoland from Los Angeles-took a while to even find other
bbs'ers, but I can now say "Eureka!" I would appreciate as much
information as possible on the local non-subscription boards in the Park
Ridge extended calling area-especially boards devoted to writing.
Thanks for the help!.Kathleen
