Yep, hardcopy for comparison is critical.

As for U/L privileges over my way, we've developed a requirement that
all callers who want file xfer status must provide verifiable address
and phone number, as noted in the new <U>ser Validation screen displayed
on your first call (and repeatable from the main menu at any time).
Over the years I've had a large number of requests for "exceptions"
to the policy developed by callers our way. But I like to be able to
<honestly> say that everyone's treated equally. :-)  If you would like,
include a phone number in your package and a reminder that you'd like
full validated status and I'll take care of it promptly after returning
to town next week (leaving tomorrow a.m.).

Again, many thanx.

Clearly, a "tools" package distributor/author must have a policy. Are
you sure there's not some kind of info with the package? Otherwise,
I'd be sure to contact the vendor/author. I've seen such things,
requiring things like "portions copyright (C) 1989, Microsoft", etc.

My favorite editor is PMATE. I think it can be had for something like
$119 from Programmer's Connection, but not sure.
 Unfortunately, it is NOT supported any more - no enhancements in about
2 years or so.
 But what I like about it is how configurable the keyboard is, and mostly,
the excellent MACRO language it has.
 You can build macros into it, some executable by function keys (only about
6 or so, though), and can build an arbitrary number of macros into it
by reserving macro space (I reserve 3000 bytes). I have macros to reformat
paragraphs, add columns of numbers, read hex numbers into a register,
read decimal numbers into a register, change "name<space><space><space>
extension" type of filenames into "name.ext" names, etc.
 The macro language would appeal to an APL programmer, or someone familiar
with TECO or other single-char macro languages. For example, lets look at
a macro to reformat a paragraph:
@wv7@a>1{@av7}$[@7qx@t=13{0l}{-s $13rqr^}l@t=13{l%}@t<"!%-mr $@k]
 Now, that's very cryptic, but it can be broken down:
 @wv7 sez to take the current right margin setting (var @w) and store
 it in Variable 7
 @a>1{ is the start of an "if". I LOVE this syntax! You don't need the
 word "IF", or "then". The syntax is: expression{clause}{else clause}
 Specifically, @a is the variable for "number of arguments passed",
 and if >{1 then .
 @7qx@t=13{0l}{-s $13rqr^} says "go to column (qx) stored in var 7, and
 if the char under the cursor (@t) is a C/R (13) then go to the
 front of the line (0l which is 0L), OTHERWISE backwards search
 (from the right margin) for the preceeding space ($ is an ESC,
 a string delimiter) and replace it with a 13, show the updated
 screen (quick redraw: QR), and "loop" back to the preceeding loop.
(^ loops back, [.] defines a loop nn[.] defines a repeat nn times, etc.

did 2 columns, some centering, some tabs, bold, etc. I have hard

to BOB SULLIVAN re: R/NEW TI VOICE CHIP

ADPCM=adaptive differential pulse code modulation. It's a form of PCM
that encodes the difference between samples rather than the samples
themselves. The actual relationship is non-linear; depending on the
recent history of the signal, a given difference can represent several
step sizes.
In terms of efficiency, it's much better than straight PCM, with sound
quality almost as good, and much worse than LPC. For telephone-quality
speech, it takes about 2.6K bytes/second (straight PCM would be 8K;
LPC would be around 1K, so I guess it's not all that much worse).
If the TI chips are based on mask ROM, the only way to program them
is to have the factory make a mask for them.

 One package of TOOLS requires a notice in the docs that the
Company's TOOLS are used. Another doesn't require a thing but
the "portions copyrighted" seems about appropriate for the
Copyright form itself.

to BRENT JONES re: R/EDITORS

depends on what type of editor you're looking for: text (e.g.
documents) or program. For shareware document editors, I've
heard good things about PC-Write (tho' I think it may not be
shareware anymore-whatever, it's still cheap.). I don't
know much about shareware/PD program editors, but one of the
programmers I work with raves about BRIEF, which is a commercial
product. It seems to have quite a following, due to a lot of
options for customizability like adjustable auto-indent, flexible
windowing, etc.

Msg 42920 is 18 line(s) on 12/18/89 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to ALL re: VIDEO BIOS PATCHES

Hi all,
 I'm looking for some help with video memory overwrites on a
dual monitos setup. I've got a Paradise VGA+ 16 and Hercules mono
installed in a system with AMI 386 mbd and BIOS. When I switch
MODE to MONO, some programs (i.e. WordPerfect 5.0) still write
junk to VGA video memory, and the mono memory is also screwed up!
Everything works fine in VGA mode.
 What I'd like to do is set up some sort of "fence" between the
two-perhaps a driver or other resident program which determines
the current video mode and intercepts any writes to video memory
which try to "jump the fence" and redirects them to the appropriate
addresses (if necessary) or dumps them to a null device (if convenient)
 Any ideas?? I'd like to know if this is at least possible, I know
it's a tall order, and I know it may be hardware dependent, but I'd
like to at least TRY! (NOTE: One of the guys I work with suggests
that it may be a function of hardware video port(s). Any insights??)
 Thanks in advance!
Colin

to BRENT JONES re: R/EDITORS

I use three, at least on MS-DOS computers. Word Star 5.0, VDE 1.20 (I also
have VDE 1.40A) and PC Write 3.03 (I use to use version 2.71).

I got Word Star from DAK with other software for $99. It even comes with
PC-Outline that you heard from here.

VDE is great for quick and dirty editing. You can edit two files at once
too. About 30K in size. Real handy! Uses WS commands!

Now we get to PC Write. I great word processor! Although not mentioned
I don't believe, can use WS commands too. Try them, they work! Now the
rest of the program is also great. It can also check your spelling as you
type. Just great. Nothing like it. If WS didn't work so nice, I would use
PC Write for everything. It's been called the best Shareware program
ever made. I agree! If not, is gotta be number two! <BW>

Msg 42922 is 14 line(s) on 12/18/89 from BENJAMIN COHEN
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/COPYRIGHT HELP.

You should take a look at the copyright license that <probably> came
with the package, or contact the author of the"tools". For example,
BASCOM (Microsoft) offers a free license that allows the author of a
program compiled with BASCOM to distribute the required run-time module
BRUN.COM. You do have to put an additional notice in your software tha
"Portions copyright Microsoftx". Any author/distributor of a
compiler of a similar ilk (i.e, one that requires use of the author's
tools/run-time module, etc) in connection with the compiled program,
or which pulls some portion of the tools into the compiled program, NEEDS
to have a policy. Some of the idiots require the end-user to have the
program, just as an interpreter would (you need BASIC to run a BAS program).

By the way - (c) is not enough of a copyright claim. Use "Copyright",
or "Copr." if you cant put the "C" in a circle.

I remember seeing a discussion of this problem in a Fidonet echo devoted
to WP. Apparently the program sizes up video memory and decides that
the VGA is an extension of the mono or vice versa. I can't remember
what the workaround was, but I know there was one. You might want
to post a message in the WP echo; it's available, among other places,
on my BBS (COPH-2) at 312-286-0608 (NW Chicago).
