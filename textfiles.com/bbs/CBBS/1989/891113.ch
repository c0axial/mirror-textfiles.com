I have been using prodigy on their free 30day trial offer. At first I
thought it was great, but now I'm beginning to think otherwise.
Besides odering ability, and Email you don't really need it. You can
get most of what it offers by watching the news on TV including the
commercials. One of the most anoying thing is some of the errors I have
experienced such as CM4 and CM6 both of which leave you, your computer,and
your phone line in limbo. I called Prodigy and they told me everytime you
leave a section Prodigy performs another handshake, or if your in one area
too long. This means that if you are writing a letter in Email or using
the BBS you may get dropped out and have to start all over - including
redialing at your expense. Prodigy support told me I should limit the
time I spend in any area to a half hour or less and that would eliminate
the problem. I have had the problem at all different times. Once tonight
in the first 3 minutes. I don't beleive they have very good support.
At least for now. Still another problem occured that left my phone line
connected. I had the CM4 error and powered down, due to the lock out,
and in aggrivation left the room for a half hour. When I picked up the
phone to use it I FOUND PRODIGY STILL ON LINE. I always have to check to
be sure now.

I was flipping through an electronics parts flier and saw microproc
chips for sale. I am familiar with the V20 but what is the V30. Is this
micro also pin compatable with the 8088 ? If so what does it offer as
far as performance over the V20.
