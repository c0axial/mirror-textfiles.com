Well, BOTH LPT2 and LPT2: DO go to the network, but one is seen as starting
with what it DOES start with - a %, and treated as Postscript, while the
other seems to confuse the printer (on the server).

Msg 42443 is 18 line(s) on 09/06/89 from BILL WOLFF
to JIM FLANAGAN re: GEOS

I think we are getting confussed here. Or at least I am. Post
formatting tells me that the program will leave the formatting up
to the printer and use the options that is available to that
printer only or compatible.

On the other hand, I am not aware that GEOS is a post formatted
program. It works by bit mapping the screen and sending the bit
map to your printer. It has a ASCII support, but it is easier to
use Word Perfect, Word Star or something else.

GEOS is one of those truely WYSIWYG things. I believe the
horizontal field is 640 across and more in the vertical field. If
your printer doesn't fit this field (most dot matix printers do),
then you won't get it all printed (you loose the right side) or it
will be too small. That's the problem with HP Lasar Jet and GEOS.
The image at 300 DPI turns out to be about 2 by 4 inch image on a
8 1/2 by 11 inch piece of paper. Not good if you want to do a full
sheet of publishing at 300 DPI is it?
