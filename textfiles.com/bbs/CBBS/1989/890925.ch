to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/CBBS SOFTWARE

The REAL answer is to get our 9600 baud modems back! Actually, I'm of the
opinion that if the noise shows up enough times to cause the disconnect
message (intended to thwart "twits" who I have seen call a system with no
intent of answering ANY questions as asked ;-), then the connection is best
broken for the sake of a "retry" for a better line.
 I AM sorry the modem is so bad - but the 9600's that went back for ROM
upgrades got lost at UPS for - what - months!w3

Msg 42514 is 27 line(s) on 09/23/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: PC DATABASE - HIERARCHICAL

 At work, (a sales office) we have more and more people who want their
own databases - customer mailing lists so they can tell them of upcoming
classes, etc.
 But this year, things have gotten more complicated - there are now
"student reps" - i.e. like many applications, you want a "header" or
"main" record, then want a variable number of records "under" it.
 Thus, we'd have a "school" main record, and a variable number of
"student rep" records under it.
 I am a Foxbase user, and recommended its use at work about 2 years
ago, and we use it a lot for simple mailing lists, etc.
 Part of our problem is the lack of a programmer - we need something that
users themselves can use - and while Fox meets that bill (once I set up
the database and the input screen), we need to do more programming to
handle "hierarchical" applications.
 One guy suggested Data Ease, but its cost is too high! With Fox, we
use the unlimited run time license, and that works out well. In other
words, what EVER we choose - a run-time license will be necessary since
we don't have thousands of $ to put into this project. (to put it
in business perspective, every $1K spent on software is, say, another
person going to a school in Atlanta that we can't do).
 Thanks for any ideas.
 One very favorable comment I got was "Clarion". It is fine that it can
produce EXE files, and that solves the run-time, but again, we'd like
something that the users can use to create their OWN applications. OH-
how about having a "central" machine with the development license, then
people can create the applications, compile them, and take the run-time
to their own machines? Hmmm.

Where can I get ahold of this Graphic Express Program? Thanks.

Msg 42516 is 07 line(s) on 09/23/89 from BILL WOLFF
to RICHARD HINTON re: R/A GRAPHICS PROGRAM??

I just uploaded it to "The Round Table" @ 777-9480. So it won't be up on
the board for a day or so. But you should log-on today to get valadated
anyway! It is called "EXPGRAPH.ARC".

Also you might want a program called "AEA301B.ARC" which is really called
AS-EASY-AS (Lotus clone). It has some bars and pie charts. But Express
Graph is much better minus the spreadsheet. <BW>

to ALL USERS re: PRODIGY NUMBERS.

I just signed up for Prodigy, so I haven't gotten anything on it yet. But
hopefully there is a local phone number besides 499-0048. As this is out of
my local calling area. This number is within my area although. I mean CCBS
number is within.

Anyway, Prodigy still sounds like PC-LINK (Q-LINK) with no extra cost
areas. EMAIL sounds hard to do and no uploading. PC-LINK is the same.
Prodigy has menu's without expert commands, so does PC-LINK. I know it
is still different than PC-LINK, but the cost and features are really
close. PC-LINK doesn't have many commercials, so to speak. Well sounds like
I'll have it about two weeks, so time will tell.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/PC DATABASE - HIERARCHICAL

What you need to do can be done with the relational capabilities of Fox
or other DBASE clones. You just create two .DBF's: The first contains the
"master" info (let's say "product line") and the second contains the
"detail" info (in this case, rep name and product line code). Using
SET RELATION TO, you can create an application that will go through the
detail file and automatically track a pointer through the master. With a
little more work, you can do it the other way around (go through the master
and pick up all the corresponding details).
