to BILL COLEMAN re: R/FOXBASE+ VS DBXL

I am familiar with Foxbase+, and find it about 5x the speed of
Dbase just from "how it looks and feels". We've got it at work,
and have bought the royalty free run time license to distribute our
applications. We're pretty happy with it, and have a relatively
novice person doing the coding.

Msg 41794 is 02 line(s) on 05/07/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to EDGAR COUDAL re: ORIGINAL CBBS

I think the idea would be, if it were to be running, to have it on the
"original" box. I do appreciate the offer of a Horizon however!

Msg 41795 is 05 line(s) on 05/08/89 from PAUL STREETER
to BILL COLEMAN & WARD re: R/FOXBASE VS

That is the type of application that I do in (Realia) COBOL with NORCOM's
SCREENIO. The combination is less verbose than DBASE III+. The compiler
does 1K lines a minute on my Tandy 1000 (an XT more or less) and the
resulting applications run very fast.
I don't expect to actually change anyone's mind with this, however.

Msg 41796 is 05 line(s) on 05/08/89 from JACK HOMA
to WARD re: WARD BOARD ERROR

When calling your bbs (849-1132) this morning I got an
error after the message 'Logging name to disk.'
The error code was 08005847. I had responded to 'Want
first time user info? ' with N;JACK;HOMA<CR>
I hope this helps.

to BILL WOLFF re: R/CP/M UN-ZIPPER??

Hi Bill,
 You are correct about the C-128 being a great computer! I use it
with the 512K Ram expander and I use all operating systems on it.
(My preference being C-128 Native) And GEOS is super fast with the
ram expander installed. I use GEOS with Computer Eyes to digitalize
certain things. It is VERY fast!
I'm VERY happy with it!

Msg 41798 is 11 line(s) on 05/08/89 from KEVIN KEYSER
to JIM FLANAGAN re: R/COMMODORE PRINTER

Of course, if you also have an old VIC or C-64 you COULD use it as a
printer buffer/spooler. You would need an RS-232 interface card for
the commodore (I use one here on the BBS, works great) and an RS-232 cable
(Db-25, I think) to hook up both computers. Then use a terminal program
on the Commodore and whatever program you want to use on the PC. Just make
sure it will output data to the RS-232 port. This data would be received
by the commodore and automatically translated. (If you were using a standard
term program such as Common Sense) You could then print the data out on the
Commodore printer.
A round about way, but it SHOULD work!
 Kevin
