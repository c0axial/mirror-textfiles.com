]__AZ:  Commodore?  Uh, lessee. 6502 proc - same as Apple - same
as Fr-nkl-n?  Heh, heh.
__Ectually, I DID see a very neat animation running (on all things)
on a Commodore Amiga 500.  FOUR separate (and different) animations
running in four separate windows - with a SEPARATE sound track for
EACH animation.  On a machine that only costs a lousy 1000 bux with
a colormonitor.  Sheesh!
__It was VERY impressive, to this kind of thing done on a machine
that costs about what a half-decent hi-fi rig costs.
__I was tempted, but am not about to get caught up in one of those
"little corners" of computing - probably watching the guy go belly
up two weeks before the thing dies on me.
__I regularly meet with some friends (this USED to be an Atari/ST
group), and ONLY the real die-hards haven't switched over to DOS.
__EVERYONE is just plain gun-shy of being orphaned, and ya can't
blame them.

 Jeez - ya bingoed the 386 on the first try, I can't even
make ya guess anymore.
 Tentatively - 20mhz, 4M, 800x600 VGA (prolly Paradise 16 bit
card & Mitsu Diamond Scan screen), and I'm tending to the Perstor
controller card with a Seagate 4096 (with it's twin to be added
within 6 months).
 Yep. A ton of bucks, but if I go the low road, I figure I can
bring it in ~4 bills (okay - 4 1/2!). Gotta figure I'll need to
toss in an 80387, so kiss off aother 400 or so.
 Damn-dest thing. I was up at the Computer Central flea market
in early Spring. Spotted a copy of FastCad (STILL in original
shrink wrapper!) for $ 150. Heck, this thing "streets" out about
1500 - about as sophisticated as AutoCad, but faster.
 STILL had the registration card in it! Called 'em up, asked
how much to upgrade to latest version; got told to send in the
card and thirty-five bucks!
 Week later, latest version arrives - and - they sent it to
me as a "courtesy", returning my check un-cashed! Heh, heh.
 Anywho, you can see the direction I'm wanting to go, CAD and
all (fits in good with my line of work); so a high-HP graphics
machine is just what the doctor ordered.
 Just keeping all things crossed right now, 'cuz the LAST
words I want to hear are ".no settlement, we're on strike."
 Otherwise, by Labor Day I'm afraid the trusty old CP/M box
will be relegated to duty as a super-intelligent print buffer.

Thanks Jim, I'll try to get my hands on a copy of the PC Magazine Issue

Take care,

 Sorry I can't be of help in your quest for an AT upgrade, but I would
certainly appreciate hearing about what you end up with and how you like
it! Hearing you say you got burned with a DTK makes me a little wary,
too. Good luck.
