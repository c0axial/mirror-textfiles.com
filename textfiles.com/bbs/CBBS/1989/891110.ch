]The lines are at first to quick to follow and the screen scrolls off
before they can be read. I discovered rather quickly to use ctrl s.
I'll go off line and read my script file of this encounter and check
it for BBS'S. I have a Radio Shack Mod. II that I want to put online
with a Corvus hard disk for a BBS (because that's all I can Get from
my employer to try a BBS out).
Thanks

Msg 42735 is 07 line(s) on 11/08/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to CHRIS THACKER re: CBBS USE

The way you learn to use CBBS is by observing the kind of topics that are
discussed, and participating in the messaging back and forth between those
asking, and those replying.
 Please also observe the "general rules" that come by in the (B)ulletin
and (W)elcome, and you should be all set! No one is going to call or write
to you to tell you how to use CBBS. Figure it out - just like everyone else
has. No "users guide" has ever been written.

Msg 42736 is 11 line(s) on 11/08/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to MIKE LADA re: WORD-WRAP

Since CBBS wasn't interrupt-driven, there was no reliable way to cause word
wrap to work on message entry - what I mean is that I couldn't back up a
partial word, bring it to the next line, and NOT lose what you'd been typing
since then. However, when leaving comments, by having a CBBS running at my
house, I was just amazed that the number of people who typed continuously
ignoring the fact that the line went on and on - I guess they didn't learn
to type (i.e. on a typewriter) the way I did. SO, I just did a "crude" word-
wrap in the comments section (when you use the (G) command), one which didn't
try to back up partial words but instead just stuck in a CR at for a space
after column 70 or something like that.
 Sorry it is inconsistent.

Msg 42737 is 05 line(s) on 11/08/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JIM FLANAGAN re: CBBS CONNECT TIME

That is one of the mysteries of CBBS. The code looks straight forward, yet
at times it appears you are accumulating the connect time of you AND the
person before you - or more correctly, the time SINCE the PREVIOUS call.
 AZ used to bug me about it until he realized it wasn't going to be fixed.
Sorry.

Msg 42740 is 07 line(s) on 11/09/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to BILL MATTSON re: R/UPGRADING XT HARD DRIVE

You're thinking of the <DOS> limitation on the size of an addressable drive,
based on the number of bits used in the FAT. That isn't the problem; the
Disk Manager driver takes care of it. The problem is more low-level than
that. The controller card can plainly access all 6 heads on the drive, as
DM is capable of doing a low-level format of the entire drive, and the whole
thing verifies. The problem is that when the driver is run, it insists
that the drive has only 4 heads.

to DON PARIS re: R/COMMAND.COM

Not sure what you mean by "can't restore your backup copies."  Do you mean that
you put in your original DOS disk (you <do> have one, don't you?) and the
system won't boot?  If that's the case, you have definite hardware problems.
If you mean that you can't use the restore component of your backup program
(especially if you're trying to run it off the HD), that could be because of
file corruption (which could have occurred due to hardware trouble; people
first think "virus" when confronted with many problems that have purely
accidental causes (such as power failure in the middle of critical writes, etc{
the worst case I ever saw happened when a system was using a write cache
and power went out before the cache had been flushed; pieces of one file
were scattered all throughout the file system).
