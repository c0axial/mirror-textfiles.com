]Your name came up in conversation by phone. I was talking to Mike Jania
(is that right) about the PC3270 control program. It appears that you
may be the authority on that piece of software. We (U of I Business
Affairs) had hard drives go bad on two of them. In both cases, the
restored INDCIPL stopped abruptlu with Divide Overflow. The problem
turned out to be that the repair people had installed PCDOS 3.2 which
is not compatable with INCIPL. We will get 3.3. I got one of the
machines to work by formatting a floppy with 2.1 and putting PC3270
on it. I thought it odd that in that I ended up with a
C> instead of A> and that VER stated 3.20. Does INDCIPL overlay PCDOS
then build a virtual machine for the PC session then boot the
new machine from the hard drive if possible? (or something like that?
Sorry about typos. There is line noise tonight.

to JERRY OLSEN re: R/TEST FILES NEEDED

Oh, you want a "pub" in Pagemaker format? OK. Tell me EXACTLY what you
want - i.e. font type and size (ex: helvetica 12 point normal, one
column, etc). The format is ENORMOUSLY complex, since for example when you
import TIFF images, it keeps a 1/4 resolution copy in it, and a POINTER
to the "real" file.
 I have a file that includes one of about 13 different fonts, as well as
some "stroke" fonts, boxes, shading, etc. I could send you THAT file,
and a copy of how the pub prints.
 I could also "just" change fonts, and save a file, so you'd have 2 to
compare - but if you think you can "reverse assemble" the file, I think
you're in way over your head.
 As to the "Emulation" related to pcjr, I don't know what you read into
my item - I just asked if anyone knew of a CONNECTOR CABLE to allow the
jr to plug into a CGA output.

A while back, I left a message concerning 387-16 chips.
Someone (I can't recall who) left a msg which mentioned in passing
that one can use a math chip which is rated at lower speed than the
CPU is run at; i.e. use a 387-16 in a 386-20 machine.
 I'm curious as to how this would work: would the end result be
comparable to running the CPU faster than its rated speed (viz. the
occasional discussion in PC Mag.)? If so, is this OK because the
math chip is not constantly in use? Or is something entirely
different going on here?
 The reason for all this is that I'm considering upgrading to a
20 or 25 Mhz 386 system and would like to avoid forking over $4-500
for another 387. Can I put a 387-16 in a 386-25 with impunity?!
 (By the way, is anyone interested in an ALR 386-16 with 2 Mb RAM,
44 meg Miniscribe 6053 HD, Hercules mono?)

I have a CGA type monitor and DOS 4.01 and I wan't dos to
recognize the colors. It only shows up in mono mode. Ideas?
