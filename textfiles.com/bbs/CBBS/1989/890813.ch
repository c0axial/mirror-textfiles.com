]I just "renamed" the log rather than going into edit.  Line noise was
just too bad today.  So you'll find it in l890812.

to ALL re: SOFTWARE CAROUSEL?

 I bought Software Carousel @ Egghead - pretty slick program! I have
set up 4 partitions, but can't get the commands to start in each!
 I've turned on the flag to say I want each pertition auto-started,
but it ignores the commands (even the first "cd \") and waits for me
at the date/time prompt!
 I have loaded StacKey - I wonder if that is at fault? I guess I should
just pull it.
 But I'm leaving this msg just to solicit feedback from other Software
Carousel users as to how you're using yours, and ask for any tips/tricks
to make effective use of it.
 Thanks!

Msg 42280 is 06 line(s) on 08/12/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to RICHARD HINTON re: R/VGA/EGA

VGA does 350 line in EGA mode, 400 line in text and double-scan CGA,
and 480 line for hi-res VGA.
 The BOARD (not monitor) determines what software can run - since even
with the monitor disconnected, the software will either work or not work.
 EGA/VGA is VERY worthwhile - if you've got just CGA, you are missing
the entire world of hi-res graphics.

to ALL re: VGA BOARD??

I saw an ad for an analog/digital VGA board by Logix in computer
shopper (9/89). It seems to compare well with the Paradise VGA plus
which I'm told will run only in VGA mode. Has anyone used this
board.if so how does it work? I am thinking of pairing it with
a Seiko multisync monitor. CM 1340 I think. Comments?

I have an Okidata 82 (not A) printer in good condition for sale. Asking
{$50/best offer. Leave message here or call voice 251-5787 (Wilmette).

Msg 42283 is 10 line(s) on 08/13/89 from GARY ELFRING
to DAVID BETHANY re: PERFECT BINDING

Perfect Binding is only done by specialty shops. There is one in
the Chicago area that I know of. (Cause I use them.) The Whitehall
Company in Wheeling. Perfect bound manuals have minimum page requir-
ments (64 pages) and then go up in increments of 8 or 16. You also
must order a minimum of 1000 manuals at a time and there is typically
a 5 - 6 week turn around. Thats the bad news, the good news is the price
is cheap! My 64 pagf;3e manuals with a two color cover (5-1/2 x 8-1/2)
cost $.68 each in a lot of 1000. Price goes down to about $.55 at 2000.
The people at Whitehall are quite nice and helpful. The prices listed
assume you present camera ready copy.

Hey, I'm up to 22 people who f*haf*ve paid $12.50 to upgrade my software
after just 2 weeks. (Out of a total of 114)

to ALL re: CACHE HAMFEST

 When is the Hamfest going to be this year? I saw somewhere
(can't recall or I'd just go look again) that it's the 20th at
DeVry. Is this correct? WHat times? Tnx in advance.

Msg 42286 is 07 line(s) on 08/13/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/VDISK 386

You just about confused me totally but I think I got it:
 The 640K stays OK. 641 and up to my 2 meg are extended?!?
 A RAM disk would start at 641K ???? So I can make a 1370K
RAM disk?
 The time accessing it is OK. I only use it for one pgm which
requires just about everything in the system including about
24 meg of space for pgm files!

Msg 42287 is 05 line(s) on 08/13/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to RICHARD HINTON re: R/VGA BOARD??

My Paradise VGA Plus has a pgm to set the MODE. I can set VGA to Herc
to 132 columns. I think there might be a CONNECTOR problem. You have
to make sure you can hook up an adapter if needed. Mine comes built
in so I would have to change the whole video sys if I changed part
of it.

Msg 42288 is 03 line(s) on 08/13/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to CHARLIE KESTNER re: R/CACHE HAMFEST

The CACHE FEST IS the 20th of August at DeVry. Get there at least by 10 AM
so if there is a deal and dealer there you can be first. Alos first
come first serve for selling space if I am not wrong.
