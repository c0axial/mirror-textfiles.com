to ERIC BOHLMAN re: MSG #2 ABOUT VT-100 INFO

 Thanks for replying to my message. I omitted the specifics of my request
for fear of being too wordy on my first message, being new to BBS's as I am.
 What I want to know about VT-100 and other terminals, at this point, is
what features they have. RS232C connection to connect to a modem for use over
phone lines? Printer connection? Disk drive connection? I've heard somer-
minals have on-screen editing with a full-screen mode. But I think most ter-
minals are mainly for single-line input (not full-screen). Have heard some
terminals have an off-line mode so they can be used as a typewriter. True?
 I want to set up a Host-Terminal arrangement for about 5 people using
"remote-takeover" software such as Remote2 or PC-Anywhere. (Carbon-Copy-Plus
is a well-known example of "remote-takeover" software.) I intend that the
remote terminal would be able to use the major IBM-compatible software packages
(Lotus, dBase, Word-processing) that would reside on the Host computer. I
should note that the remote-terminals will connect to the Host one-at-a-time,
using 1 phone line into the Host. No multi-user UNIX system until later-on.
 Manufacturer of Remote2 says can communicate with "dumb terminals" such
as VT-100, etc. I've seen several mail-order adds offering used VT-100
terminals for under $200.00 each. That's a heck of a lot cheaper than buying
computers! But not sure whether or not htese low-cost terminals will do the
job I need to have done.
 The only terminals I'm familiar with are IBM3270-series synchronous ter-
minals attached to IBM mainframes. I am completely in the dark regarding these
asynchronous ASCII terminals. Want info first about features of the terminals
and about quality of the experience of using them, in order to evaluate their
suitability to my project. Want technical info about connection to modems &
remote Host-computer only in a general way at present. I.E. Will it work?
Later I'll be eager to get involved with techniccal specifics such as codes
and software patches, etc. Would like to take the title & author of that
book you mentioned, just for future reference. (You said it was a good one.)
 Again, thanx for your response to my request-for-info.

to ART WALLER re: R/PC JR FOR SALE

 I mignt be interested in buying your PCjr. Will have to think about it
for a few days, have some other things going on just now. One question I
have is about the memory expansion. Am not familiar with the microsoft
booster/mouse that you mentioned. I would want to use the PCjr with a
modem & I've heard some of the memory expansions use the internal-modem slot.
Is that slot still available on your computer? I see you don't mention a
modem in your description. I suppose I could attach an external modem via
the Serial connector; 300bps of the internal PCjr modem would probably be too
slow after I really get started with this pc-communications thing. Anyway,
would like to know what modem-connection possibilities are available on your
machine. Also, do I assume that everything works?
 Well, that's it for now. Wanted to give you my name. Feel free to
leave message here. My home phone # is 549-2183, if you want that. Has
answering machine for voice message anytime.
 Bye.

I have a cheap EGA card here, but there are some strings attached. Is
your "someone off line" technically oriented? It seems that as a result of
my mixing up the power cables on one of my XTs (or it could have been the
defective buss connector on the motherboard) this EGA card will only function
for about 10 minutes before doing crazy things.misplacing characters
changing colors and eventually locking the computer up. I removed the RAM

to ART PITKIN re: R/MSG #2 ABOUT VT-100 INFO

The VT100 is an asynchronous dumb terminal originally manufactured by
DEC. It's obsolete from the standpoint of hardware which is why you see
them for sale at $200.00 (about $150.00 too much) but the protocol
standard they used is still very viable. It's original protocol
lived on in the VT200 and VT300 series of terminals still used today.
Most comm programs support VT100 because it made for a nice asynch
video standard and was around for years, akin to the IBM 3101 and
3270. F'`It is an ASCII dumb terminal with the ability to switch
back and forth between character sets, thus allowing line drawing
and foreign characters to be used. It can communicate
with an asynchronous host at speeds from 150 baud to 19200 baud.
If you're looking to use a VT100 terminal to communicate, I
would suggest that you look at some of the VT100
terminal clones now available such as WYSE, C.ITOH and others.
There's a ton of them. Or, use a good comm program and hook
PC's up to the host and get the best of both worlds.

hi art the juniors memory expansion with the microsoft is done in sidecar
fashion, all external, the internal modem slot is open. the lat time i used
it everything did work fine. i have the cable to convert the junior to an
external modem. also the pc joystick. also the ibm printer attachment i
also have an extra hard disk board. it was supposidly fried when i bought
it but it turned out that the disk had been thru magnetic field
and its low level format erased. i believe i can did up the procedure
i got it from racore, in case its ever needed again. in order to be fair to
both of us, we can make an arraingement, such as you giving me a deposit on on
it and i'll let you 'test drive' it for a month. if anyt{ing turns up
bad we can negoiate the price or cancel the deal. of course i would
personally deliver an{ set it up and give you all the knowledge i have on
about it. there are some quirks. by the way this is a old unit, the hard
dma. you can call me at 286-5914 sat-sun 12-6p. thanksdma, so some new software

A couple things in random order: first of all, the book is titled
"A programmer's guide to video display terminals." I forget the author,
as the book isn't handy right now. Second, there's one limitation
of using a straight VT-100 in the application you describe: it has
only 24 lines, whereas many programs insist on using all 25. Some
of the more advanced terminals that support VT-100 commands (sorry,
I can't recall any names) do have 25 lines.
In general, dumb terminals can be hooked up to printers if they have
printer ports; the use of the printer is somewhat limited (key-activated
screen dumps and program access to the printer by sending special commands;
note that you cannot (unless your "remote" program is incredibly sophisticated)
redirect LPT1 to a printer attached to a terminal. I'm not aware of
any options for connecting mass storage devices to terminals; some
provide off-line editing, but the storage buffer can hold at most a
few screens and the program on the other hand has to know how to get
the terminal to send the results.
As far as hardware interfacing goes, they connect to a modem just as
a computer would. They don't provide dialing directories or the other
facilities associated with terminal programs on computers; to call
this board, you would connect your terminal to a modem and type ATDT5458086.
Some models have a few programmable keys. You'll have to check the
software you're going to be using for remote operation in order to
find out what key sequences translate to things like the PC function
keys and the various cursor-control keys.

Found out Boca AT RAM expansion board doesn't work. (model #4202).
Turns out its a bad model. Boca said send it in for the new model
(#4205), free. Point of purchase Wholesale Computer Products (Wheeling,
537-5059) didn't have the right model in stock, but offered to send it
in for me. NICE people there, call Tom.

U.P.S. has it now, I should get the new board in a week or two.

Bought Phoenix BIOS 3.1-10 (with built-in setup). DOESN'T WORK with
Suntac AT board! (Award DOES) Computerese (Schaumberg, 885-9161) has a
NO RETURN policy on chips, so I'm stuck with brand new BIOS I can't
use! DON'T call Computerese.

Thanks for the replies. I had started with the DOS 4.0 manual, and got
little help (big surprise.) Eric's answers helped quite a bit. Then
I got an update announcement from LOTUS. Version 3 will be able to use
extended memory on 286/386 etc. For my company, the answer is leave the
extended memory alone, upgrade to 123V3, and wait for other software to
catch up or worry about drivers for expanded memory when an additional
need arises.

Msg 42146 is 08 line(s) on 07/22/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to PAUL STREETER re: R/EXPANDED/EXTENDED MEMORY

There are a number of driver programs (install in CONFIG.SYS) that make
extended memory look like expanded memory. Some of them are even free,
such as the one PC Magazine published last month. The tradeoffs are 1) there
are a few things that hardware can do and emulation software can't 2) the
emulation software can be rather slow, and 3) the emulation software has
to put its "window" somewhere in your 640K addressable area (hardware
boards put it in an otherwise-unused address space above 640K but below
1 meg), so you lose up to 64K of main memory.

Msg 42147 is 11 line(s) on 07/22/89 from PAUL STREETER
to BRENT JONES re: R/CLEANING DISK DRIVES

I found out by experience that they are NOT self-cleaning. My T1000 was
giving me "drive not ready" in all circumstances on the B drve. I was
about to replace it, when I discovered a friend getting exactly the same
action from an IBM AT. The coincidence made me think about possible
common factors, and non cleaned heads was my first guess. We bought a
cleaning disk from Radio Shack, misused it and had to go buy a
bottle of rubbing alcohol and an eyedropper, but then did $400.00
/ f /nch charge and parts for $4.00. All such kits seem f be a low
lint pressed cotton diskette. Some are used dry, some with alcohol.
The basic process is the same as cleaning a tape deck or VCR, as the
recording medium is the same except for shape.
