Msg 42663 is 20 line(s) on 10/23/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to PHIL JERN re: R/HP LASERJET IIP

 Hey, glad you like the HP LJ II-P.
 Could we make a comparison? I spent just over $1K on my DeskJet, and
got the following as a result:
 - full page LJ graphics
 - 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 14 point fonts in Times Roman & Helvetica,
 - Courier in 5 and 10 pitch 12 point, 16 and 20 pitch 6 point.
 - NO landscape
 -
 People asked "for that price why didn't you go for a Laser". Well, for
one thing, there weren't as cheap a laser then, but also, to get "what I
wanted" I'd have to add memory and several font cartridges.
 Thanks.
 -
 P.S. I finally got approval from work for a 2nd 44M drive for my 80-
so while I really appreciate the offer of your 71M drive at the good
price, and HATE to pass it up, I simply don't have a machine to put
it in - unless I were to consider it an "upgrade" for my 2-yr-old
Miniscribe (which had one "small crash" - at least that's what I'd call
losing 3 clusters of data, each 1 track apart on the same "surface").
 REALLY SORRY for not getting back to you sooner on your kind offer!

Msg 42664 is 06 line(s) on 10/23/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to TONY ANTONUCCI re: R/COPY

Yep! Sure got a lot of "files with no filetype" that are kind of big,
after doing a copy of *.* to a non-existant directory.
 The other one I get a kick out of is when our publishing system is
started without the "EPT" (dunno what it means, but it is a character
driver) driver for the Postscript Printer. There are huge "EPT" files
out on disk !8^)

Msg 42665 is 22 line(s) on 10/24/89 from PHIL JERN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: HP LASERJET /P

Well, it's a little bit like comparing apples and oranges. I spent
just a tiny bit over $1200 on this thing. for my money I got:

1. The basic printer itself
2. The not-so-optional lower cassette tray
3. One EP cartridge
4. A freebie printer cover from Elek-tek
5. An Elek-tek pen from the sales clerk at the register (because i begged)

Capabilities? 512K of memory built in, I am able to download all the laser
jet soft fonts, plus use cartridge fonts. Built in fonts include Courier in
10 and 12 point, eight point line printer, plus bold and italic
typefaces in the Courier. All the internal fonts work in both portrait and
landscape mode.
The built in character sets are Roman-8, PC-8, PC-850, and something
called ECMA-94. All together it comes to 34 variations, that can
be printed in either orientation. Not too shabby in my book.

Memory is expandable in 1 or 2 MB increments. plus there is a Postscript
cartridge in the works. I hope this amplifies my previous message
sufficiently. Oh yes, the output doesn't smudge if the humidity gets
too high. :)

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/PRODIGY

Ward,
No U/D loads in prodigy, what I was refering to was that evenings
attempts to communicate/contribute to other BBS. As far as prodigy
goes, I think its best feature is demonstrating to people with a
2400 baud modem what it must be like to own a 300 baud modem. I
am very much a rookie at BBS and "modeming" and if it were not for
the Prodigy offer of a Hayes personal modem I wouldn't be here.
(At least not yet). Well anyway, reading the Prodigy EMail is a
treat. It makes a rookie like me feel comfotable.
You were right about the ability of the Hayes personal modem. At
times the line conditions are such that I get lots of garbage.
I'll let you know how it fares over time. Now another question.
Do you know a good split screen editor, that allows swaping between
windows and editing in either window, both text and hex?
Thanks, Mike P.S. Bear with me, I'm still learning. It takes time to
comprehend the command structures, and get proficient with various BBS's.

The 708 and 312 area codes are NOW availabel although the official date is
still November 11th you can REPROGRAM your communication packages and
autodialers for the new areacodes immediately.

to ALL re: PHONE NUMBER DATABASE?

I have called a few boards around town that seem to check a database of all
local phone numbers that are active to be sure the one a new user entered
in is correct. I am wondering where I can obtain a similar program.
Any ideas?

The new 708 area code is NOT available yet in CHICAGO. I would not
advise reconfiguring anything just yet.

Msg 42670 is 08 line(s) on 10/26/89 from CALVIN CURTINDOLPH
to MIKE DEER re: R/NEW AREA CODE

I have added 708 to all of my suburban phone numbers. I only call f
from within the city limit{. My calls get through. So what do you mean
when you say that 708 is not available within Chicago? If you mean that
Chicago numbers do not work when dialing 708 (i.e. - 708-545-8086 doesn't
work), they are not supposed to - EVER! 708 is only for numbers outside
the city limits.

Msg 42671 is 10 line(s) on 10/26/89 from KEN STOX
to ALL re: NEW AREA CODE 708

Not all exchanges have installed the data necessary for use
of area code 708. For example, here at Bell Laboratories,
Indian Hill, 708 will be intercepted by the CO advising the
caller that the call CANNOT be completed as dialed. This is
pretty humorous, as our ISDN phones do display our numbers
as 708. I suspect that more and more of us will be able to
use 708 as the exchanges are updated. The November 11th date
would be the day that ALL exchanges will have been updated
by. So, if it works for you now, go ahead, but do not expect
it to work out of every exchange until 11/11.
