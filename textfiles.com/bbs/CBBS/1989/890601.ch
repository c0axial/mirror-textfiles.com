to ALL re: CGA TO PCJR DISPLAY?

We have some old PCjr displays at work - can they be used with a CGA via some
kind of adapter? - probably yes, but where would I obtain such an adapter?
The display have one of those screwy 2 x 10 .1" spacing connectors (the '10'
is a guess - not sure).
 Thanks!

Congrats on the new board! I'd love to go CD too! But, the new 44M Iomegas
look pretty attractive, too! Gad, it seems no matter how large a hard disk
you have, it fills! My main machine is 71M divvied into 4 partitions, so that
I can back each up on an ancient 20M tape cartridge (courtesy of Randy Suess).
 Nice to hear from you again. Hope things are goin well.

Msg 41874 is 15 line(s) on 05/31/89 from PAUL STREETER
to WARD re: CD ROM/ CD?

You mentioned CD. I saw a CD ROM on a 286 PC. Is there a read/write CD unit?
For that matter, am I talking about the same type of device you were. The one
I saw was at the main Post Office in Chicago; the disk in the drive contained
every (or nearly address) in the country, and is used with their ZIPMASTER
software to supply ZIP+4 coding for a customer submitted diskette of a
mailing list. As you might guess the process is a bit tedious even for a 286,
just over 2 seconds per address. It is fairly smart, and can often figure out
mispelled street names. It cannot figure out most "vanity addresses" such as
"1234 Sears Tower" nor can it decipher that west suburban phenomenom of
"18W1234 St. Charles Rd." if a Chicagoan has tried to "fix" it by making it
"18 W. 1234 St. Charles Rd." (Both of those are made up.) What seems odd to
me about the program is that the customer's disk data set must have a true
fixed record length including all trailing blanks, and counting the CR/LF if
present in the length. I had not previously seen that on a PC.

Msg 41876 is 16 line(s) on 05/31/89 from JERRY OLSEN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/TEST FILES NEEDED

My programs involve files "native" to a given environment. They were
specifically designed for a phototypesetting environment, with the current
intention to expand them to work for DTP. The programs in fact have been
reported to work properly on some "lesser known" DTP systems, and my current
request is to seek files which Pagemaker/Venturra/?? use <directly>
themselves.As I believe I mentioned last time, I'm looking for two types of
files at the moment: 1) one which is as "simple" as possible, and 2) one which
contains "cutesy" codes-font changes, typesize canges, etc., etc. Any help?
   Another msg of yours (to ALL) queried about CGA emulation on a PCjr. Someone
uploaded such a beast over on the BBS I run, though I haven't looked at it in a
year or so, and then only in my role as sysop to check before releasing. If
interested, feel free to take a look. I don't even recall the filename, but
using the SEARCH program to check for "CGA" should find it quickly. The
Advocate/NOWAR, 312.939.4411, 24 hrs., 8/n/1, Loop area. Hope it helps.
