 Thanks.
 Just WHERE is this sucker located (streets)?
 I'm from Indiana, and I'm not real fond of getting lost
in Chicago (me and the wife did that again today), so help
is much appreciated.

We have a fairly large selection of CP/M modem (and other) software over
on a board I run. You'd have to incorporate a couple of overlays for your
friend's particular terminal and type of modem, but it's quick and easy.
If interested, give a call over this way and either browse or leave a
message directed to "ALL" for details.Just occurred to me that I <think>
someone uploaded a super-generic modem program which may not need any
configuring. It was written essentially to permit users to download their
first "real" modem program. I don't recall the precise name, but after
exiting the message-base program, type GO MODEM to get to the right
area. (Type HELP for menu-driven details on funtions and such.) Good luck.

to DAVID BETHANY re: R/MANUAL

As Eric mentioned, I work with a broad variety of printers, usually with
substantial trade discounts. If interested, you can call the BBS-see
Eric's msg or the immediately prior msg, it's still on-line (#42290). Or,
call me workday afternoons voice, 312.939.3300. I also can directly provide
prepress services (typesetting, design, etc.) if desired.

to GARY ELFRING re: MANUAL PRINTING

 I didn't know you were up to that size and quantity. Perfect binding
seems to make sense. Good luck in the cruel world of getting onto
retail shelves and staying there. That's one battle I haven't tried yet.
 By the way, are you ever going to get the group together again to swap
lies and eat pizza? If I have some time toward the end of the year I may
ask for the mailing list. I have some good ideas for potential members
and guest speakers.

 Ah, the fun of putting a system together. At least your main supplier
hasn't joined the finger pointing. Hope by this time you are up and
running. Is the floppy working OK? Do you see a speed difference?
By the way, if you think you will need it, I can send you a copy of
the floppy setup from your old ALR manual.
 Used your old ALR last week to check out a National Instruments
32-channel digital I/O board. Worked just fine, and the slot openings
on the back were much better for the 50-pin connector than the NEC
AT-clone it will be used in.

 WELL, the main loacation is exactly where Riverview Park used to
be at Western and Belmont, behind the shopping center, across
the street from the police station. A big black glass building (a
few stories only).
 3300 N. Campbell St. In the DeVry building and parking lot. If you get off
at Belmont going NORTH you go EAST a couple blocks. A map helps! You could
also get off at Addison going NORTH and then go EAST. Western is a MAIN
street so it is hard to get lost and fairly saef on a Sunday
morning. (That's safe).
 The CACE BBS is (312) 470-1691 if you need last minute help.
Boy I am tired. I am leaving fairly early that AM but:

to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/VDISK 386

It looks like my first meg is all used up. The RAM drive uses the
2nd meg and then has a remainder (512K RAM- 524K extra mem).
 The problem I am having now is using the extended mem. The
video driver for special pgms uses regular memory and I am short
with only 640K. GAD, this is interesting.

Will a _Used_ 2 pen plotter cost $500? I want it for very, very occasional
use, so I don't want to spend much. Brent Jones (in Wheaton 665-4462)

to WARD C. re: MESSAGE NUMBERS

Ward, I like the simplicity and ease of use of your BBS. BUT .
would it be possible to start the numbering over from 1? I get
lots of mistakes by typing 40902 instead of 40092. I know that it is
a small point but anyhow.Brent

Joel,
How in the world did you get a DeskJet Plus for $109? It is a fantastic
printer, but not cheap. Brent
