I have a Western Digital 10MEG Flash card which takes up 1 slot in
an IBM PC, 1 1/2 in an XT. Asking $125. You can get in touch with
me at Discovery Place BBS - 312-383-6335.

Ward,
It was a pleasure to have met both yourself and Randy at Barnaby's
for the anniversary celebration. I hope to see you both for the
12th annual celebration.

to WARD re: 8086

Ward, now that CBBS has survived yet another year, the question can be
asked: was it fortuitous that the phone number for CBBS-1 is 545-
8_0_8_6? Or merely wonderous coincidence?

Msg 41386 is 12 line(s) on 02/20/89 from MIKE ANDREWS
to WARD re: MODEM ADJUSTMENTS.

There's another problem I didn't figger. CBBS doesn't know about the
"/ARQ" result codes, either, so if you call with an MNP modem, CBBS
doesn't wake up. The quick solution: have Randy put the modem on
the system in terminal mode and do a "AT&M0&W". That will disable
error-correction and also speeds above 2400. You have to have MNP
on to get 9600. See page 5-6 in the manual.

Otherwise, there are NO ERRORS even without MNP! I was hoping for that.

I've decided to start I new project: to get the original CBBS in the
Smithsonian. I'll call Roy and let you know the plan.
