to ADAM DADA re: VGA PROGRAMS

Deluxe Paint II is a super program for VGAs. The 256 color mode
is a great blast, and even the 640 x 480 mode is nice, since you can
do things like dithered fades from blue to yellow in 8 steps, and still
have 8 drawing colors left, which can be anything of your choice.
 For just "fun", you go into 256 color mode, set a range across the
entire 256 color palette, then turn on 8-way symmetry, and "doodle".
You can then hit the TAB key and it will "animate" your drawing
(not really, it just cycles the color palette).
 As to CBBS typing "DISC" and hanging up on you, it was reacting like
any decent person would when you use such foul language! ;-)

to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/HARD DISK INTERFACING

What kind of drive are you thinking of using? Or is that open to
question (SCSI, ESDI, ST506)?
 I know a REAL good disk jock, who for example makes his own
ROMS for adding extended drive tables, and he recently became an AMI
BIOS source person, so he can add features to it, etc.
 If you want I could ask him, but tell me which kind of drive is
to be preferred.

Greetings; (gee, just when you think it's safe)
 Following the messages about ressurrecting (sp?) the original
system and saw the note that you did not have the original software.
Hope this don't stir up the hornet's nest, but how "original" were
you/they thinking. Packrat that I am I have every release that I ever
got from you.

See that V.4 is running here too. PC? Assm or 'C'?
(you could probably guess the next question)

CBBS/NW hits 10 on May 8th. Just goes to show that you are not the
only crazy person in this game. B->

Best wishes as always!

to ALL re: VCR TAPES USA/EUROPE

First, thanks for the disk life responses.
I have a VHS tape from Vienna. I think that
European TV uses different signal patterns than
American TV; however, I thought that the VCR's stuff
might be compatible since I have seen tapes from Europe.
My tape does not work, maybe it was the airport
security check??
 Does anybody know about USA versus Europe TV signals
and VCR compatibility?
