Mike :
I can't help you with Ma Bell. I just wondered if maybe a better ground on
your end may help. Make sure you incomming box is grounded to a cold
water pipe. In addition; a modem surge protector available at Electek and
the like - might buy you something .
 Good Luck Jim Sackett

to ALL re: VGA ANALOG CABLE

I just became the proud owner of a ATI VGA wonder card. The problem is
I used my NEC multisync in digital TTL mode before (9 pin to 9 pin cable)
and I now need to find a (15 pin to 9 pin) analog cable or adapter.
Any ideas where such a beast can be found. I tried NEC.they want $48.00
Would like one soon, as right now my new Super-VGA card is no better then
my EGA card was.
dup. chars.
