No, I don't have the original software. I didn't have compatible
diskettes at the time - I had - remember - my old "Dynastor" flying
head floppies, whichbellied-up in oh, about 1981 or so.
 What the heck is going on in (812) land? A project for USR?

Msg 41650 is 06 line(s) on 04/06/89 from MIKE COOK
to MIKE ROSE re: R/DISK LOGGING IN MS-DOS 3.30

I had a similar problem with a Toshiba 1.44Mbyte drive in an IBM PC.
In my case, I had the Ready/Disk Change Jumper set wrong. I really
have no earthly idea what this does but it appears to tell the
system that pin 34 is not used (the condition in a PC/XT). When
set for "no pin 34" my DIR problem went away. I hope this helps.
