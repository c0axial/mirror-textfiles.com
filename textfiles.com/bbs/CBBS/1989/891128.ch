to CHARLIE KESTNER re: R/PC VOICE STUFF

 What I might have said was that I had bought "The Speech Thing" which
is a little box, and doo-hickey for your printer port, that lets your
computer speak, and that the same company (Covox) did have a microphone
related "appliance", but I'm not sure if it had any voice reco software
or if it was just for recording things to be played back.
 I might also have mentioned that a few years back IBM had a board th{t
you could hook a microphone to and you could do things like 'DIR' 'B'
'colon' 'backspace' 'colon' 'enter' (the backspace being because it
mis-understood the colon, grin).
 I don't know what practical hardware there is these days for speech
reco. How big a vocab you looking to do?

One of Covox's (same people with the "speech thing") does supply speech
recognition software with its "voice master." I have no idea how good it is;
they claim it will recognize 64 words or phrases.

to ALL re: CLEANING DISKETTE DRIVES

I had my first SONY 3.5" diskette go bad on me today (after 3 years).
Which brings to mind the thought of possibly cleaning my diskette
drive. At work we never clean anything and the drives seem to just
keep working and working. I looked in the slot with a flashlight and
I could see dust (the fluffy house type) but not great quantities.

I used one of those ozone layer destroyer compressed freon cans to
blow ou the dust but I hesitate actually cleaning the drive itself.

What are the pro's and con's of diskette drive cleaning?
Oh by the way when I looked at the diskette very closely it did
have a scratch on it that looked like it was a gouge mark as opposed
to a worn spot.

I doubt that dust could have done that but I would be appreciative
of any expert information in this subject.

to CHARLIE KESTNER re: SPEECH

 Got literature for QuickBasic stuff and there is somekind
of black box for speech. I would assume it is able to
program the voice file in somehow. Was going to send for
literature but wonder what good speech would do on a 386.
