to RICHARD HINTON re: R/VGA/MULTISYNC??

I'm not POSITIVE, but I think a single-frequency VGA monitor should
still be able to display CGA, given that your graphics card can
support CGA software (most VGA cards can). However, I'd check with
Amdek first to avoid unpleasant surprises!

Msg 42504 is 14 line(s) on 09/20/89 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to RICHARD HINTON re: R/RLL/MFM

As far as I know, most RLL, ESDI and SCSI ctrlrs use c800:5 as the
start address for their ll format routines, although I doubt it's
universal! Also, many can be jumpered to move the address so as
to bypass address conflicts with things like video BIOS, etc.
For example, an Adaptec 2322 ESDI ctrlr can be jumpered to set
the address at cc00:5. I'd use an ASCII/hex editor like the one
in PC-Tools to look for setup code in the BIOS. Also, I'm not
sure that MFM controllers HAVE BIOS based ll format! If the doc.s
don't mention it and give the proper address, assume it doesn't.
Disk Manager works well, and I don't believe there's any speed
degradation; also, the RAM taken by the DMDRVR driver is quite
small. Finally (and this is in reference to another reply to
your msg), dos 3.3 doesn't allow partitions larger than 32 Mb,
but 4.0+ and Compaq 3.31 DO. Good luck w/ everything!

I'd be interested to 'talk' with anyone out there who uses VM/386
for multitasking with common programs like WordPerfect, 1-2-3,
and comm. software, as well as less common prog.s like statistical
analysis software (esp. SYSTAT). This is 'Tips, Tricks, & Traps'
type stuff. Anyone interested pls. leave me a msg. here.

Richard,
 Prodigy is definately Proprietary software driven. You have to use
their graphics based software. I doubt that many who are currently
BBS users will be very impressed with it. But for beginners, like my dad
it will probably be useful.

Unfortunately I don't work for that company any more. After just hiring me
last July, they sa that there was no money to pay me. I am busy
looking for a new job. Perhaps some other authorized Novell dealer
has the book for you to examine. $200 is a t of money for a loose-leaf
notebook type book, but the information could be very important to a
programer.
Good luck.

any names and phone numbers.

to ALL re: NEW BBS OPENING

The Chicago Public School System has opened a new BBS - The EIES (eyes) of
the Chicago Public Schools.  With 200 different message bases, U/D libs
for all computers, Email, and the ability to follow message threads instead
of reading them chronologically.  Soon to have On-line Dictionary and
32 phone lines.  For a new telecomm experience, call:
EIES (Electronic Info Exchange System) of the C.P.S. at:
*
(312) 890-8512  or  (312) 890-8513   * (800) number soon! *
*
Suggest that you read the Quick Start Tutorial first - the software is a
bit different than most BBSes you're use to using.
Also, if you want to be able to receive Email, you'll need to create a
Mailbox for yourself.  Type E, for Email, and answer yes to prompts. Then
you be able to enter a message about you and your interests - no line
limit, so be creative if you wish.  HANDLES are accepted if you desire.
*
Features include attaching files to messages, or vice-versa, ability to
view contents of ZIPs and ARCs on-line, online conferencing, and much, much
more.  Tell them that Mr. Nobody sent you.

wants a graphics program that will do "cylinders", I don't
he means pie chart only but raised cylinders. Also I need a program
that will graph in three dimensions. Say graphing results from an
experiment of time one versus time two and have a display of the
second experiment behind the first on the same graph. I have done
it with SAS/SPSS, but it has been a real pain to program it. I
