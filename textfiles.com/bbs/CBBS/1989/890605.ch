to RICHARD HINTON re: R/SETTING COLOR FROM DOS

Dos does not in and of itself generate colos. You need to rely on
ANSI.SYS to do the colors for you.
 Do the following.
 - place "device=ansi.sys" in your config.sys. If you are "well organized"
you won't want to put it in your root directory, but rather put it in some
directory, such as \dos. Then the line would be:
 device=c:\dos\ansi.sys
 Then, in your autoexec.bat file, you will have a prompt command that
includes some color changes.
 The syntax of the color changes which ANSI.SYS handles is:
 - esc
 - [
 - foreground color in the form of 3x, where x goes from 0 to 7
 - the following optional background setting:
 - ; to separate the background from the foreground color
 - background color in the form of 4x again x being from 0 to 7.
 - m The letter "m" is what tells ANSI.SYS what the preceeding
 numbers are.
 So, for example, I like "brown" (it is "amber" on my screen) so I use:
33 as my color. Experiment. 0 is black (30 black foreground, 40 black
background). I forget what the others are. You can experiment.
 To cause the escape to be sent to ansi.sys, use the prompt command, which
allows "substituting" an esc by typing a dollar sign then an e: $e.
 Try this:
 prompt $e[44;37m$p$e[40m$g$e[33m
The 44 is blue, 37 is white, so this is white on blue, then the $p is
the path (so my "d:\yam\cis" shows up white on blue). NOTE that I didn't
have to put the 3x then 4x, 4x then 3x is OK.; Then, the 40 resets the
background color to black, and 33 sets the foreground to "brown".
 Good luck.

to COLIN SCHROEDER re: R/80X87 SPEED/ RATED/ACTUAL

80x87 chips run at rated, actual speed. What differs is the speed at which
a particular system clocks them.
 When IBM first came out with the 6mhz AT, there weren't 6mhz 80287 chips
available. Instead, 4 was. SO, IBM took the 12mhz crystal and divided it
by 2 for the main system clock, and by 3 for the 80287.
 IBM needless to say took a bit of flak on that - in that the PC could
actually run some math faster (at 4.77mhz) than the AT. SO, when IBM
developed the PS/2 line, it was decided that math co-processors would work
AT the system speed. Thus even the 20mhz model 70 or 80 uses a 20mhz
crystal.
 I bought a 10mhz AST Premium machine, and wrongly thought that it would
use a 10mhz math co-processor, so I bought one. It turned out that
it clocked the chip at 8mhz, so I had wasted my money by buying one that
was TOO fast, but generally you can clock things SLOWER than they were
designed for, with no problem.
 So, like all devices, you should not clock them past their rated speed,
and the info you got on '87 chips probably related to something like my
machine, i.e. you might have thought "an 8mhz 80287 is 'good enough' for
a 10mhz processor", while in fact it is "the 10mhz machine clocks the
80287 at 8mhz and thus an 8mhz '87 is fast enough".
 At least that's how I see it.

Sounds like your "pub" file would do very nicely as one of the two kinds I
seek. The print copy can be sent to me at: Advocate Enterprises Ltd.,
899 S. Plymouth #504, Chi 60605. (If any questions, daytime voice: 939.3300.)
As for the file, whatever's most convenient for you is fine (assuming it's
not TOO large; I'm running at 2400 bps). D/L from here, or via disk.

The other file I'd like to obtain, from you or elsewhere-and preferably
with hardcopy too-would be one which is as <absolutely> simple as possible,
i.e., w/out font changes, no graphics/shadings/etc.

Thanx for whatever you're able to provide. If there are any out-of-pocket
costs for which you want reimbursement, lemme know.

The outcome is that we will buy PCDOS 3.3 for the machines. The way that
