to ALL re: 286 LAPTOP F/SALE

Have a mint condition Zenith 286 Supersport for sale including a 28msec
hard disk and all assessories. Also, a Toshiba T1000 for sale - best
offer. Call Joe at 356-6817.

Msg 42790 is 02 line(s) on 11/24/89 from JOE JESSON

Would like to buy a VGA color monitor used or a great price.
Call Joe at 356-6817.

Msg 42791 is 07 line(s) on 11/24/89 from JOE JESSON
to ALL re: OUTLINE SOFTWARE

 I guess Grandview is one of the finest outliners available today. After
using Thinktank for a number of years, I recently bought a copy of
Maxthink. Maxthink has a super, but "different" manual that is quite
enjoy{ble to read. the general "free text" database software
known as IZE is supposed to be one step above anyf* outliner. Any choices
which is best??? Maxthink has the best manual and features compared to
Thinktank or PC Outline.

to DENNIS DUFFNER re: R/42655

I did not mean it to say that all Prodigy users will drop out! In fact,
I'll be the first one to say that Prodigy has some great features. Some
are the weather map, news and nation-wide message service is great with
a printer to file utility installed.

But since most 100,000 plus users are using it for free. Most of them say
it is nice and cute, but they won't pay $9.95 a month for it. So most will not
be around in 1990. Sure there will be some die-hard fans who will continue
to use it. No question about it! Just like there are PC-LINK fans out there.
What more can I say? <BW>

Msg 42793 is 06 line(s) on 11/24/89 from ED FOSTER
to JERRY OLSEN re: AREA CODE CONVERSION

 Jerry, I downloaded your conversion program, but was unable to use
it because the database I want to convert has several phone numbers
in each record, and some of the records have both a Chicago numbe{
and a suburban number.
 Is there a list of prefixes remaining with the 312 code? That would
make it a lot easier.

Msg 42794 is 01 line(s) on 11/24/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL

Do you have any approx. prices on the color printers shown?
