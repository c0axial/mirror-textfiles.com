to MARTY DIPPEL re: R/ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

Unfortunately, when you do a SET, you effect only the current env,
not the parent.
 Thus, as you've found it doesn't help to set it from a shell of
command.com.
 I have seen items on hunting down the CHAIN of environments, so
you theoretically could change the parent environment, but can't
come up with any further info, sorry.

Msg 41495 is 04 line(s) on 03/17/89 from JIM ANDERSON
to COLIN SCHROEDER re: R/80387-16 CHIPS

The prices have gone down somewhat as the 8087-3 are now under $100 and the
top of the line 80387-16 is priced at $400. But the 80387-16 is p
high at $330. The xx87 cooprocessor chips do not need be the same speed as
the cpu, they can be slower.

Msg 41496 is 04 line(s) on 03/17/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to MICHAEL SZEWCZYK re: R/XMODEM CRC

I'm not familiar with BASIC compilers for the ST. Most versions of BASIC
would make writing the necessary routine a bit difficult, but if your compiler
has a good set of bitwise logical operations, it might be possible. If not,
can you link in a routine compiled in another language?

Msg 41497 is 03 line(s) on 03/17/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN

There's a national echomail conference devoted to WP; you might leave an
inquiry there. Among other places, it's available on the COPH-2 BBS at
286-0608 (NW side).

Msg 41498 is 04 line(s) on 03/17/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to MARTY DIPPEL re: R/ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

I have a bunch of C listings lying around that describe how to change the
master environment. If interested, leave me a message and I can upload
them to my BBS, or we can arrange a direct transfer. It's a pretty short
ARC file (about 2K, if I remember right).

Msg 41499 is 04 line(s) on 03/17/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to JERRY OLSEN re: EXE2BIN

I wrote a similar program, and had no trouble turning it into a .COM file.
Since you mention that you're getting junk characters at the end, are you
sure you're stopping when you see a CR at the end of the command line, r
rather than a null?

Msg 41500 is 03 line(s) on 03/17/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN

A fairly recent copy of the Darwin list is available for download on the

I remember right.

Thanks for the help! I'm not sure which is your board, though I've run
into you before. Programmer's Connection? Anyway, to make a long story
short, I don't have a PC here, just a terminal. I suppose I COULD bring
the modem to worrk and set up some sort of clandestine arrangement, but
would really prefer to gain access to your C programs by other means.
How about I leave a message here for you when I (finally!) get a PC here
at home? Should be about a month or so.
The batch file can wait, but needs to be done eventually. Meanwhile,
thanks!

My board is COPH-2 (286-0608).

I suppose I could print out a listing (not very long) and mail it to you
if you'd give me your mailing address (warning: I tend to be very slow about
mailing things I've promised to mail!).

The code isn't mine; it came from some magazine.

Msg 41505 is 10 line(s) on 03/18/89 from MARTY DIPPEL

It might be best if you could mail it to me, Eric.
The Address here is:
Marty Dippel
3622 N. Bernard
Chicago, IL 60618

I don't think I've ever called COPH-2, but I'm familiar with the name.
I'll give it a call this weekend!
Please (K)ill this message after you receive it; I'd rather not have
my address hanging around. Thanks again!

Msg 41506 is 08 line(s) on 03/19/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to DMITRI ELLINGSON re: BACKSPACING

The "usual" backspace key - i.e. ASCII control-H has worked well here
for 11 years! Also, should you insist on a non-video backspace (i.e.
what ever you are running can't backspace) then the usual DEL char will
do the trick. If you can't generate THAT key, then you can use the
CBBS "V" command to set a video backspace char of your choice. (The
most common use for this is users who have to shift to get a backspace,
so they substitute DEL for it)
 Good luck. Thanks for stopping by.

 Help me please! I recently installed a modem to my IBM compatible and
I need someone to call. I live in southern New Jersey and I don't know who
to call to obtain a list of local BBSs. I would greatly appreciate it if
someone could find me a local number to call. Since I am only a beginner,
I hope to find a BBS in the (609) area code so that I don't have to spend a
fortune while learning to use my system.
