Heh heh, if you've never seen a BBS like this, it is because you've never
before called the worlds first and oldest BBS. Using this system kind of
reminds me of riding around a pasture in a friend's grandfather's Model A
Ford. In other words, little has been done to 'modernize' CBBS, but on
the other hand, when learned, there are few BBSs that can be used more
quickly and efficiently - little "fat" here.

Well, just completed my first MNP call at 2400! Unfortunately, the
delays due to MNP menat my sign-on came in as "Wad Chr.", so I'll have
to make some changes before I put that version online.
 Unfortunately, it didn't allow a 9600 baud call! I initialize the modem
at 2400, and wait for the result codes, and I'm testing for all the
codes in the "teens" - and setting to 9600 if I see the ARQ or non-ARQ
9600 baud answer.
 I'm calling with mine with AT&M5, at 9600, but when a connection is
made, I get "Connect ARQ/2400", not 9600.
 I recall you saying I should be at 19,200 baud, but that's not
practical from the setup I currently have on CBBS, should I try sending
the commands and awaiting results at 9600? Must be modem be at the
highest speed to be able to connect at the highest speed?
 Thanks!

I recently purchased a Mr. Mox modem operated switch for my bbs. It is
activated by the carrier detect signal. At that point, it turns it self on
for at least 1.5 minutes as long as carrier detect is present. This all works
fine and dandy, except that it takes too long for the computer to power up
and load the required driver software. It would be nice if I could rig
a way to have the computer begin power up on the first ring. My question is
could I simply connect the ring indicator to the carrier detect line of
the modem and run them both to the carrier detect in my modem tap for the Mr
Mox or must I design an OR gate and send that result to the CD line?
If I must design the OR gate circuit, are the voltage levels on the
RS-232 signals sufficient to drive the circuit?

Msg 41447 is 20 line(s) on 03/05/89 from MIKE ANDREWS
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/HST 9600

You have to have CBBS send the ATA at 9600. The modem will not connect at
a spped above the port rate it detects (no place to put all the extra data).
It don't think you'll need an interrupt. You only need a 19,200 port rate to
get data compression or 14.4. If you don't lock with &B1 it'll match the
port to the connect rate (like the 2400 did) and you won't get 14.4 connects.
No sweat, you ain't doing file transfers anyway.

BTW, to see YOUR modem fly set your PC to 38,400 do a AT&B&1&H1&W. Disable
auto-baud rate change in your com program, enable RTS/CTS hardware flow
control. Call USR's PC Board system 982-5274 (i think). You should get a
14,400 connect. Try a YMODEM-G or ZMODEM dwonload. You can get up to 1700cps
on .ARC files.

Try out PROCOMM Plus (the plug you in the docs) or QMODEM 4.0 to get these
features.

This week I've been calling the Canda Remote BBS with my 9600 HST and getting
THREE megabytes of new files in an hour and a half. 360K takes about
3-4 minutes. About as fast as a disk copy on some machines. I got 1100cps
all the time. Have fun!

Msg 41448 is 06 line(s) on 03/05/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JIM POLOUS re: R/RS-232 HELP

RS-232 signal lines are specified as being from -5 to -25v, and
from +5 to 25V, so they are not "TTL" compatible (when you said "OR"
I presume you meant the TTL function).
 You could probably diode-OR the two lines together i.e. in such
a way that CD and ring don't interfere with each other, while allowing
either to be seen by your 'box'.

Msg 41449 is 28 line(s) on 03/05/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to MIKE ANDREWS re: R/HST 9600

HEY! CBBS - 9600 baud! Know what was wrong? While I was manually
setting the speed to 9600, and I set AT&M5, my SCRIPT for calling was
setting AT&M0 because the old CBBS didn't recognize the ARQ connect
codes.
 So, everything looks pretty good now - contrary to what you said,
I am able to initialize the modem at 2400 (i.e. no changes from
before, and the extended connect codes come in at 2400; causing me
to switch to 9600, which then handles the call OK. However, without
interrupt driven receive, it is nearly impossible to key into CBBS.
I am now keying at a rate of about 5 characters per second, determined
by an automatic buffer delay in my commo program. Setting it much
faster causes characters to be lost.
 I picked up a little interrupt-driven RS-232 INT 14 replacement
from compuserve, because, like the standard INT 14, I don't think it
sends chars if CD is not present, but what I'm wanting to DO is to
issue ATA. (my philosophy is to ATS0=0 and ATA so if CBBS isn't
working, the modem won't be answering the phone making people pay
for non-working calls.
 You know what "ERA" could be opened up by the great HST modems?
The ability to have REMOTE devices! It would be practical for ex.
to have CBBS's drive to be drive G: on my system, using the 9600!
Perhaps you should bring this idea to the attention of Guy Gordon
of Brooklyn Bridge (White Crane Systems) or Mark Eppley of Travelling
Software. I'm `friends' with both of them; talk to Eppley every
month or two on Compuserve; (He's very busy so I don't bug him).
 What do you think? A remote-bridge! Heck, I could back up CBBS
from here - easier than getting Randy to do it (grin). (Atchally
I should re-write CBBS in "C" and run it on Chinet)

Msg 41450 is 28 line(s) on 03/05/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: CBBS TESTING 9600 AND ARQ

I have put a version of CBBS online that is PARTIALLY supporting 9600
baud and ARQ.
 I say "partially" because the input is not interrupt driven. My own
logon script caused characters to be lost because the modem is sending
in small 'packets' of characters due to MNP and ARQ. At 9600, it is
nearly impossible to send ANYTHING - you have to type at about 5-10
characters per second. For example, with YAM there is a character
'throttle' (slow-down) command, and I have to set it to about 140,
while normally I'd go with 8 or less.
 I am looking at an interrupt driven INT 14 replacement, and when
that goes online, CBBS should be able to handle the speeds much faster.
 For some reason, perhaps the dual-console I/O (to the screen and modem)
as well as the overhead of V-20 8080 emulation running on a 4.77MHz PC,
a memory dump at 9600 baud resulted in only 350 CPS, not a lot more than
the 210 CPS experienced with 2400. (I tried 2400 with and without ARQ,
and they seemed to be identical in speed, but I got some line noise bursts
at 2400 without MNP, (or ARQ - not sure of the terms! Is ARQ a USR
term?).
 SO, if you have an MNP modem, feel free to try it at 1200 or 2400,
and if you want to "just see what it is like" (perhaps "how bad it is")
try 9600.
 Oops, I haven't tried calling in at 1200 MNP, but I presume it would
work OK.
 Thanks to USR for these great modems - hope I can get to the interrupt
driven stuff soon, but a big project coming up mid-next-week will put
all other things on the back burner for about 8 days.
 Other than the loss of input characters when sending too fast under
MNP, let me know of any experiences you feel I should know of.

Hi Ward. well, sounds like i may have to redo that portion of hashing the
user file. I dont want to loose any people in the user file, as i have
passwords assigned (they picked them) and once i have verified them,
i dont want to loose any one that was verified. hmm. guess i should
take a week off as vacation and look into the code. have seen the
users name "become lost" in the user log. have had users with passwords
become lost after awhile of use. so, either i fix it, or replace
the code with the original stuff (user routines that is). so- 4.0.1.
more tricks?? Byron In Central calif. (209) 685 0306 CBBS and RCP/M

Thanks for the materials; they arrived in spite of the best efforts
of the US Postal Service! I will be sending the disk out in a couple
of days with a bunch of little PD utilities on it. Thanks again!

Gee, that's too bad - I'm forgetting - did we chat about this at some
previous time? What have you done with the hashing routine that
makes it "loose" (sic) people? Or did you find something wrong with
my original routine, when certain parms (file size?) are picked?
 The technique I would use would be to write a little program that
reads the old file, and re-hashes into a new file.
 By the way, did you know that if you want to double the user file
size, you can just use an editor to copy it to itself? Gee, now I'm
forgetting why that works, I think the users will hash either to the
first half or second half, but in the same relative position as when
the file was half as large. Only problem is with passwords the un-used
entries won't be deleted. Hmmm.

to JIM POLOUS re: R/RS-232 HELP

You'll need to work out some sort of one-shot circuit; the ring indicator
line will go on and off during the ringing cycle. You could use a 555
timer and some transistors for level translation. The period of the one-s-
shot should be around 15 seconds; this will give you a steady output as
long as the phone continues to ring, and will drop reasonably quickly if
the caller hangs up before connection is established.

Needless to say, when using this option you shouldn't set your modem to
auto-answer; have the system to tell it to answer once it wakes up (other-
wise you may time out your modem's carrier detect).
