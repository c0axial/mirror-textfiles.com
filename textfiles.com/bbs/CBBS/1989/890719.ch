You need to be a little more specific; do you want to know details of
function codes (e.g. how do you address the cursor), special keys,
hardware interfaces, and so on. If you're interested in the former,
I have a book that's a fairly complete listing of control codes for
various terminals; let me know.

Someone else recently asked the same question. I've personally run across
only one such BBS set-up, called (ahem!) PUPPY, a shareware program. I
left complete details about obtaining a copy on my BBS when I had such in
front of me the other day. If interested, call the number below. The
message date would be either the 17th or 18th, which would put it somewhere
around #750-800. I'd suggest trying two things to track it down quickly.
If R;'BBS' doesn't find it (note the SINGLE quote marks and semicolon
carefully), try S;750 and scan up to a likely-sounding msg, then use the
Read command. Shouldn't be all that hard to find, really. If you <truly>
can't find it, leave me a message on my BBS and I'll track down the info
in the hardcopy records. Hope it helps.

Is there a short explanation of what all of these mean. I have already
read the PCDOS 4.0 manual.

Msg 42122 is 05 line(s) on 07/19/89 from PAUL STREETER
to JOHN O'HARA re: VT100 REVISITED.

I had flunked even with the book open. I did have line noise at 2400 Baud.
My modem did not match yours at 1200 Bd on 3854475; even though it always
matches the answering modem. After a bad try, it is necessary
to exit CROSSTALK and reload it. After that, I printed a few items.
Thanks and my apologies for being smart-xxxx on the first message.

Msg 42123 is 09 line(s) on 07/19/89 from JOHN O'HARA
to PAUL STREETER re: R/VT100 REVISITED.

No problem. I have had some problems with CROSSTALK in the past. The
emulation wants to be there, but every now and again an escape sequence
slips through and gums the works. In fact, it got to the point that I
switched to PROCOMM{after it became available. I've seen some
people refer to a new shareware product called TELIX
(spelling?) but have yet to find a copy. Thanks for logging on
to the system. We're doing our best to fill the database with good
jobs.

Hi there. Having DOS 4, have you had any programming problems.
Hearing a lot of bad news about DOS 4.01 but haven't had any
problems YET. The SHELL is a waste though and it does take
10-20K more of RAM.

Anyone have a good EGA monitor and board for a 286? I have someone
off line who is needing one and looking for prices other than
NEW.

Msg 42127 is 25 line(s) on 07/19/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to PAUL STREETER re: R/EXPANDED EXTENDED/ EXTR[

Your message header was a bit garbled, so I assume you're asking about the
difference between EXTENDED memory and EXPANDED memory. As you ma{
know, an ordinary 8088 (which is what DOS was written for) can address
one megabyte of memory. However, some of this address space needs
to be used for things like the ROM BIOS and screen memory. This leaves
DOS with 640K of "user" memory.
The 80286 and 80386 processors are capable of addressing more memory
than the 8088/8086 can. However, they can't access it when emulating
an 8088 (which is what they have to do to run DOS); they have to be
switched into something called "protected mode." Extra memory in the
address space of an 80286/80386 is referred to as extended memory.
Programs have to go through special contortions to access it, and the
access can be slow because switching the processor from normal mode
to protected mode and back takes some time. Also, extended memory
isn't available on XT-class machines.
A few years back Lotus, Intel and Microsoft decided to address the
problem of having only 640K to work in, and they designed a special
memory board that allows XT-type machines to access additional memory.
The idea is that you have a board with a lot of memory, and special
circuits that let you make 64K of it "visible" by creating a "window."
Memory on such a board is called expanded memory, and a fair number
of programs can make use of it, whereas only a handful of programs
can access extended memory. Note that memory added to the motherboard
of an AT-type machine is almost always extended memory; it won't help
you run software that's expecting expanded memory.
