to KEN NESS re: RETRIEVE NEW

r;*;+;+;+;+;+ is hardly necessary. Do: qr;*
 "Quick summary, with auto-retrieve". It will also remember the first
9 new msgs in "variables" #1 thru #9, so if you want to say read the first
of the msgs, you can r;#1, and thus "stop" so you can REply to it; or if
not then r;#2, etc. CBBS is a kludge, there's usually a short way to do
something.

Sorry, this is a CP/M, PC, and Unix board. Check msgs 16-19 for possible
Amiga boards.

to ALL re: BADGE-A-MINIT

Great way to display your PC graphics: make 'em into BADGES! Or cut out
your favorite Mandelbrot's from the magazines, etc.
 If you have a good drawing program and a plotter or HP Think Jet,
or an old Canon ink jet like I do, it is great fun to make badges.
 Badge-a-minit corp of LaSalle IL, (815) 224-2090 makes all the goodies.
If you want to do so on the absolute lowest budget, you can "cheat" and
buy just the "dies" and not the press - assembly rings P/N #1100, $13.50
plus badges, #3010 for 50 for $9.95, or perhaps #3020 for 100 @ $17.95.
 Or, do as I did, and get the low-end hand press, #1000, which comes
with parts for 10 badges, for $29.95. Or you can go with a bench system
#1400 for $49.95, has 2 assembly rings (so 2 people can work more
productively) - but NO supplies; or #1501 which is a bench press with
the neat cut-a-circle (#2000 for $18.95 if purchased separately) and
supplies for 250 badges.
 Rather than going on, - if interested, call them. Outside IL call
800 223-4103. Be ready to be surprised how FAST they ship stuff! I
ordered Mon or Tue, was playing with it by the weekend, and here, Tues
PM, I've ALREADY gotten my additional 100 badges and cut-a-circle!
 If $60 is about right for you, go with the "master kit" with hand press,
assembly ring, cut-a-circle, parts for 50 badges, and 100 designs you can
use.
 When making your own badges, use either 2-3/4 circles if it is on thin
paper, or 2-1/4" circles if it is heavy stock such as a photograph, which
wouldn't "crimp around" the badge during assembly.
 If you have a simple badge you'd like me to make, and don't mind my
84 DPI color jet printer, let me know, or you can send me your artwork
to make badges out of. Supplies in reasonable quantities are about 20
cents, etc. I don't want to "go into business", but I can "fill a need"
for customized badges.

Tracy, I want to get some MIDI hardware to tinker with. Give us
non-musicians an idea of what price range these things go for.

to ALL re: REPLACEMENT MOTHERS?

I need to locate a source of replacement motherboards for original PCs.
Note that these are in a 5-slot case. Can a 7-slot board (XT) fit into
a 5-slot case? Or does anyone know of somebody who is making a replacement
specifically for the 5-slot. Note that I'm not looking for anything
fancy, faster than 4.77 MHz would be nice, but we
are talking about an 8088/V20 machine here (though we'd be open to a '286
replacement as well. HELP!
