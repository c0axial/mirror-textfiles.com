to ALL re: NEED N* DIMENSION HELP

Back in '84 I bought a Dimension and was a dealer. The machine worked
very well until this week. Since I am no longer a dealer and don't
even know if North Star is still in business. I'm stuck. I repair 286 and
and 386 machines all day long, but the North Star has me baffled.
The cursor never comes on. The floppy drive is never checked and
no sign on prompt. If it were a pc I would change the mother board,
replace the disk controller, or replace the hard drive. None of
these solutions seem possible. I don't know where to get the
mother board. Even if I did I could buy 4.66 80286 machines for the
price I paid for the Dimension. THe new machines would be faster
and have 4 times the memory and 10 times the speed.
Any suggestions? Anyone want used Dimension work stations, monitors,
or keyboards?
Leave a message here or call me during business hours at
256-5500 ext 62.

to DONNIE STUHLMAN re: R/NEED N* DIMENSION HELP

Let's see, is that a CP/M machine? The symptoms you describe sound like
a processor failure, or possibly a memory failure. If the unit has a Z-80
processor and it's socketed, try replacing that chip (even if it's a very
fast Z-80, it shouldn't cost you more than $5). If that doesn't help, and
if the memory chips are socketed, try replacing them. One other thing
(which you should probably check before anything else) is the power supply;
verify that you're getting outputs of +5,+12 and -12 volts from it.

Msg 42479 is 07 line(s) on 09/13/89 from DONNIE STUHLMAN
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: N* HELP

THe North Star Dimension is a multi-user multi-processor computer
that uses an operating system that looks like MS-DOS 2.11 to the
user. Actually the operating system is three times the size of
MS-DOS. I will try to check the memory chips and the voltages.
The power supply will not be easy to replace. I of course did
try to push down the socketed chips. Since both work stations
are down I suspect the problem is in the file server.

I have a used Tektronix 536 scope that works most of the time (depending on
temperature, sometimes the trace will keep blanking out before it gets
completely warmed up). If it's just for a class, you might be able to live
with it; if you wanted to keep it longer, I'd get it repaired. I'd be willing
to part with it for $50 or so. If interested, leave me a message or call
me at 251-5787 (Wilmette).

Jim; the only mention of PostScript that I could find was in the
Addendum page 2. And it only deals with the LaserWriter. And the
LaserWriter won't work with HP Lasar Jet II. So I am sunk. The
only thing I can do is send it out to have it done. Too bad, as
I don't know why it supports the LaserWriter, but not HP?
