If you want I could send my CONFIG.SYS to you via SYSLINK.

to BRENT JONES re: R/PRINTING ON PLASTIC

I dunno where you get your transparencies, but Quill in Lincolnshire offers
them in boxes of 100 for about $30.00 (depending on type and quantity) and
that's a lot less than a buck a sheet. Fol laser printers they run about
$42 a hundred. I don't see any continuous fform transparencies in the
catalog. Transparancy film for plotters is only $44 per hundred if you
buy 500, but more in smaller quantities.

Thanks for your advice. I know that LASTDRIVE is okay, but the idea of
duplicate substitution hadn't occured to me. I'll check it this weekend.

The BIOS is for an 80286 and will work on any no AT board (not XT).

 Has something happened to the Igloo? I've had more than one person ask
me why it doesn't answer.

 If you haven't gotten rid of that $10 EGA card, I'll take it! I'll
try to call today (Fri) after 7P to talk about it.

after a HOT day.

Msg 42184 is 04 line(s) on 07/27/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to CHARLIE KESTNER re: R/4DOS

Look slike I always hit upon an interesting and complicated subject.
Now I even have to check out files to get the correct latest
data on DOS 4. Guess that is what happens when getting into
something over my head. Lokks like knowledgeable fun though.

Msg 42185 is 02 line(s) on 07/27/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to PAUL STREETER re: R/ENVIRONMENT REVISITED (AGAIN

You can just send the typed info necessary E-Mail on Syslink (neew
one).

Msg 42186 is 07 line(s) on 07/27/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to ALL re: MULTIPLE HDS

With DOS 4.01 partitioning my 2 40 meg HDs, I still get THREE
hard drives showing as 40 megers with SYSID44. With Nortons I
get the two I really have. Could this be a bios problem? It
runs OK but I still can't get over this extra drive showing
with some software (sys checkers). If it is the BIOS, then
the Disk Manager was OK with DOS 3.2. Oh well. Just another
thing to check out sometime.

Msg 42187 is 03 line(s) on 07/27/89 from MARK WATERBURY
to ART WALLER re: R/PC JR FOR SALE

I may possibly know someone who may be interested in the PC jr, if it is
still for sale. My number is 416-0899; call after 6pm weekdays, or anytime,
and leave a msg on my answering machine.

Msg 42188 is 08 line(s) on 07/27/89 from LEO ANGEVINE
to WARD CHRISTENSON re: HELLO

Ward,
I saw reference to this BBS while passing thru the new BBS forum on CIS.
I spend a lot of time in my apartment in Chicago and would like to stop
by once in a while. I have a PC, XT, and T1200HB computers. I run a BBS
on the XT from our farm office located in NorthCentral PA.
I look forward to xchanging info here.
Thanx,
Leo

The SHELL=C:\COMMAND.COM /P /E:2048 worked great. I think I have
enoygh space now! The manual isn't too good for learning these commands.
No wonder there are so many 3rd party books out on DOS.
