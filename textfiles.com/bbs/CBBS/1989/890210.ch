Msg 41312 is 09 line(s) on 02/09/89 from ROY PLUM
to ALL re: PREVENTING A VIRUS INFECTION?

I have a question about computer viruses. If I accept a disk containing
data only, or data and programs but only read/copy the data files,
taht was written to the disk by a computer system that may have been i
infected, am I safe from infection as long as I don't run any programs f
from the disk? Are infected data files contagious? I can't imagine
how it might be done, but I'd like to be sure. Will a contaminated
floppy be sterilized if reformated on a clean system? Or should posibly
infected floppies be discarded. I send data files on floppy to other
systems, and I'm concerned about the possibilty of catching something.

Does anyone know where I can get documentation for the Tagged Image File

Msg 41314 is 21 line(s) on 02/10/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to ROY PLUM re: R/PREVENTING A VIRUS INFECTION

Data files alone should not pose a problem, contrary to what the mass media
may say. However, there could be a case where what looks like a data file
is actually a program file which some other program from the same source
renames and then executes; a "two-part" trojan. Normal care should prevent
this, however.
If you reformat a diskette, it won't contain any files, so it will be safe.
Note that nowadays, a virus is the first thing people think of if anything
goes wrong with their hard disk. Most such problems are due to other
causes, and most authors of malicious programs can't resist putting
in "gotcha" messages that display when the damage is done. The best
protection is to remember "if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is."
The mass-media reports say that anyone can get hit randomly, but the case
histories they present tell a different story. My favorite was the $1.50
far-eastern pirate copies of Lotus thmK)?z6w&_h&U|Q+C=riaLOo0;D]3kvA'`oX	'dYX2 rqqRi@BA1XfK!12uS*7"X: soBbFY^Vthing.

There is one thing to be aware of regarding data files: if you have an
ARC file of unknown origin, list its contents before unARCing it. If
it contains COMMAND.COM, AUTOEXEC.BAT or something like that, be very
careful. In fact, be very careful if you're unARCing something and it asks
you if you want to replace a file; don't blindly say "yes."

Msg 41315 is 08 line(s) on 02/10/89 from JERRY OLSEN
to ROY PLUM re: R/PREVENTING A VIRUS INFECTION

It may be quite obvious to you, but to round out Eric's good comments,
you of course should ensure that you never use a suspect disk in your
<boot> drive. The COMMAND.COM and other system files on that disk could
conceivably be doctored. Using simple, built-in commands (e.g., COPY)
invoke the system files. So just ensure you're booting, and invoking
system programs/functions from <another> drive.It's all to easy
to become paranoid about the virus problem, but then again <reasonable>
and easily followed precautions would be prudent to follow. Regards.

Msg 41317 is 09 line(s) on 02/10/89 from CYRUS PATEL
to ALL re: IBM SYSTEM/23

Does anyone out there have any info/programs (pd) for an IBM System/23
system with a 8" drive, and a hard disk (20 meg??)? I just got one a
couple of weeks ago with manuals, but the only software was build
in BASIC (yeach!), a word processing program (i ain't a secretary),
and a package called BRAD(s) (can't remember what it stands for now).

If you have any info. I'd appreciate a reply on either this board,
or The Programming House BBS (312) 386-9271.

Msg 41318 is 14 line(s) on 02/10/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to ALL re: LIKE PALMISTRY?

 I am looking for a reputable person who would like to get a copy of
my new program for running it and commenting on it ease (or not
so easy) of use.
 It is PALMISTRY FOR ALL. A palmistry "report writer". Requires:
EGA, 640K, a hard drive, printer. It is 4 360K disks, plenty of
drawings and I am finishing up the instructions (should not be
needed though).
 Sat-Sun 7 AM to 2:30 PM 794-5572
 4 PM to 9 PM 775-2593
 You don't have to know a thing about palm reading to run this.
It is intended for novices. Need a SERIOUS person interested
so as to make comments on any problem in understanding it. I
might have to add a few more tips in the docs, like where I
used abbreviations on the menus.

Msg 41319 is 06 line(s) on 02/10/89 from MURRAY ARNOW
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/COPYRIGHT FORMS

Let me add a little info on software copyrights. I strongly recommend the book
How To Copyright Software by M.J. Salone (Nolo Press). Its loaded with examples
on how to fill out the copyright form, as well as, how to submit copies of the
software with the form. Incidently, I too was amazed at receiving the forms
the next day after phoning the Federal Information Service. I also agree the
$10 dollar fee for copyrights is well worth it.

Msg 41320 is 20 line(s) on 02/10/89 from BILL WOLFF
to ALL re: VIRUS PROBLEM SOLVED?

I was working in Milwaukee a couple of weeks ago and the customer was
listening to a radio program on computer viruses. Not once did the a8AIQ5R|say anything about putting on a write-protect tab on the boot disk. Many
people called in and asked what the government or universities can do
about viruses? He just said things like stay away from PD stuff, etc. I
really wanted to call in and tell him that he overlooked something.
Commodore 8-bit computers are virus proof. How is that? They use a ROM
that can't be written on. Operating system is there by turning on the
power. What about getting a newer OS? Well the DOS cost about sixteen
dollars and the ROM is on a socket. No, I am not saying we should all buy
8-bit Commodores or Tandy ROM MS-DOS V2.11 computer, but perhaps new
computer makers may look at this as a super selling point. And if anyone
is listening out there? I would like to see a CPU that is programmable
that it can be programmed to be many different CPU's. Then we would have a
generic computer hopefully capable of running almost any software known. I
know, all you smart ones out there would notice that video formats, ports,
mice, colors would prevent most of it to work. But let's work on that when
it comes. Oh by the way, it maybe possible to write a virus for a
Commodore, but it would be very hard to hide it and it would most likely
not be saved to disk and so would die.

Msg 41321 is 05 line(s) on 02/10/89 from BILL WOLFF
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/DISK MAILERS

Yes, look up Calumet Carton Co. in South Holland. The disk mailer is
called Stayflats. I don't have the number or price, but I have bought one
at a time in Milwaukee at 50 cents each. So I know you can buy them allot
cheaper than that. I am considering getting 20 or so, perhaps you can
order 20 more than you need and cut me a deal?
