Sorry, no, Comdex is notorious for quoting list prices only, and since
I wasn't in the market for a color printer. I presume you should have
about $10,000 before you go looking seriously for 300 dpi with postscript.

Msg 42797 is 02 line(s) on 11/25/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL

 Just got a mailer from Elec Tek and they have plenty on color printers.
Interesting, but those add on are something else!

Msg 42798 is 07 line(s) on 11/26/89 from TONY VACI
to ALL re: COMPUTER FOR SALE

I have a Gateway 286 16mhz VGA computer for sale. This is a 286 machine
with 1 meg RAM, 40 meg hard drive, 3 1/2 & 5 1/4 high density drives.
a Logitech Mouse and a 1200 baud modem. The monitor is an IMTEC(Samsung)
Multi-Sync VGA with 800 x 600 resolution. The computer is only 1 year
old. I have to sell it due to serious health problems. I am asking
$2,100 FIRM. I also have a Panasonic KXP1124 LQ printer for $275.
Call 708-636-4209 and ask for Tony.

Msg 42799 is 06 line(s) on 11/26/89 from CHARLIE KESTNER
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: PC VOICE STUFF

 I seem to recall seeing a msg from you regarding PC voice
recognition (?), something that you'd either seen and/or
purchased.
 Did I get this right? I'm not certain if it was you or
not, but am fairly certain it WAS here (but no can find).
 Tnx in adv.

Msg 42800 is 04 line(s) on 11/26/89 from JOSEPH SKOM
to JOE JESSON re: R/286 LAPTOP F/SALE

Joe,
 Would you be interrested in trading the laptop for a PS/2 Model 50?
I have one and could use a laptop of similar specs like the Zenith unit,
as it is much less bulky.

Msg 42801 is 03 line(s) on 11/26/89 from JOE JESSON
to JOSEPH SKOM re: R/286 LAPTOP F/SALE

Will consider the trade but would like to have $ to pay for
other computer purchases. Seems like a continual money drain
to buy monitors, etc. Does a VGA monitor come with it??

Msg 42802 is 04 line(s) on 11/27/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to PETER JOHNSON re: R/MEDICAL BBS'S

The COPH-2 BBS (312-286-0608, NW Chicago) has a somewhat old (from this spring)
list of medically-related BBS's which can be found in the file area devoted
to articles. It's available for download to new callers. It's ca
MED0489 or something like that.

I am terribly sorry about misspelling your name, just too lazy
to look on a paper right beside me.
Anyways, thanks for looking for the {_xmodem source for me, I
was able to find it else where.
thanx again, have a day :)

to ALL re: NETWARE APIS

If anyone has access to the Novell Netware API book or C function callsf*,
would someone please clue me in on a method of getting the physical
station ID from the cards on the other user{ computers? It is the only
item I need to get from the book as of now. We will probably be getting
the book (or C library) sometime in 1990. Any help would be appreciated.
You can upload and C source to my bbs:708-422-0527

Msg 42806 is 12 line(s) on 11/27/89 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/PC-BASED UNIX OS

Thanks for the info-I'm familiar with SCO, and got a standard
info-pak from them. The problem is that, for my use, their package
is too expensive. That's why I'm inquiring. I've used UNIX OS on
a mini system (Ridge, ever hear of them ??!) and want to go with
386 based UNIX, but want to "go cheap". I'm getting some info
from Everex on their release of AT&T UNIX, which is about half the
cost of SCO's version. I'd like to get some good comparative info
from people in the know-so I probably should talk to Randy.
Unfortunately, I <lost> the FLASH and so need help reaching him.
Would appreciate more help (in addition to all you've already
given-THANKS AGAIN!).

to ALL re: ADAPTEC 2322B CTRLR

Has anyone out there had any sort of weird filesystem problems with
an Adaptec 2322B ESDI disk controller with CDC (Imprimis) Wren III
drive? I recently had a weird experience with a statistical soft-
ware package (SYSTAT) creating data files from large ASCII files,
in which the file header + some data was mysteriously duplicated
at the top of the file, rendering it useless. This happened ONLY
on a Zeos 386/20 with aforementioned ctrlr and drive, but NOT on
an Everex OEM 386/25 with the SAME CTRLR and MiniScribe drive!
Weird, huh?! Any ideas??
