]Hi, I just called to see BBS history (and let me tell you, I feel very
historical about now!) and I have a thing to tell you: the Xpert function
does not seem to work. What I mean, every time I go to try it, it
goes "Translating to ;H;;CHAT" or something similar. I buffered the
menu d
(oops) so didn't need to have it displayed.

Since CBBS/Chicago was put on line in '78, and the PC came out in '81.

Well, I'm mostly into BBSing, though a friend is anxious to have some
of us take a quick trip up to Wisconsin for lunch some day by private
plane.
 So, you farm and fly commercial jets, and BBS now and then? Quite
a combo.
 My most recent interest is in MIDI music - I'm trying to get the most
out of some VERY old MIDI equipment, and perhaps update it a bit.

Msg 42374 is 16 line(s) on 08/26/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to BRENT JONES re: R/PRODIGY WARNING

Our computer club (APCU) had a demo of Prodigy today, and each person
in attendance got a free access kit and 90 days free use (not bad!)
 Unfortunately, it won't work with my COM3: modem, though I'm going to
try patching the BIOS data area so if it USES the addr there, it will
pick up my COM3: addr instead of COM1.
 The EMAIL idea is pretty good - and also bill paying - it can probably
darned near pay for itself. The speaker, from Detroit, said that he has
all his "automatic" payments made - mortgage, car payment, etc - things
that are identical from month to month.
 He also said that he could mail checks to non-affiliated organizations,
such as say the PTA, and that Prodigy will write the check and MAIL it!
 The LAST THING I need is another thing to keep me tied to the computer
instead of working on my house (vacuuming, painting, etc), but looks like
this might be it!
 Unfortunately it works in mono on a CGA, so since my commo system is CGA
it will be "boring" if it works at all - otherwise I'll use my laptop.

 You asked if I 'thought' about letting people write reviews of the BBS's
so I could maintain the list. You must have missed reading the msgs and
my comments on same - I DON'T MAINTAIN THE LIST except I will delete any
number reported to be calling a "person" and not a BBS.

Msg 42376 is 08 line(s) on 08/27/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to RICHARD HINTON re: R/EXTENDED MEMORY??

On a 286-based AT, you basically have three choices for using extended memory.
1) Use it as a RAM disk
2) Use something like Desqview or (heaven forbid) OS/2 that will allow it
to be used for multiple tasks
3) Get a software emulator that will make it look like expanded memory,
which a fair number of DOS applications can use.
You can't push DOS itself beyond the 640K limit (well, you can push it just
a little bit, but not to the point of adding several megs on).

Msg 42377 is 09 line(s) on 08/27/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to JOE JESSON re: R/ANI TELEPHONE SERVICE.

Remember that until the caller ID service becomes really widespread, it
will be of limited use because it will be able to show the calling number
only for calls that originate in the same exchange area. Eventually
central offices will all exchange this information.
The privacy issue could be handled easily enough: a caller who didn't
want his number to be displayed could dial a special prefix before the number,
causing a message to appear on the recipient's display stating that the
caller wishes not to have his number known. The recipient could then decide
whether or not to answer the call.

Hi. I just read your message about Profigy not working on Com3. If you
eventually find a way to patch the BIOS area, I'd appreciate it if you
let me know how you went about it. I have another program that only works on
Com 1, but our modems are all on Com 2. Thanks.Mike

You can change the DTR setting to what you want by sending:
AT &D 2
This will allow you to use + ATH to disconnect.

thanx for the reply, but i'm a little confused.is it that
vm/386 is using vga memory in a weird way, or what? If you can
elaborate, i'd be grateful.

to ALL re: INFO ON DTP

I have been looking ig my desk top publisher from PFS first ch
ce. Due to some of the limitations that are obvious - in addition; to the
limitations that are not so obvious. Like when I rented a HP laser printer
series II for a weekend at 146.00 dollars to print out some documents in
letter quality mode using laser fonts. I found the result to be even density
but the print wasn't much better than the dot matrix print I had. Since
you don't send out staight ASCII to the printer in any publisher you can't
use thier nice fonts. You have to rely on what your publisher downloads.
One solution was to buy a memory res. program from Atech Software which
corrects much of the problem even on my dot matrix.
However; I have been doing some publishing on the side and the quality is
better but can still be improved.
I have been looking into Vetura Publisher which seems to have almost every
thing you could want others like GEM, Byline,PageMaker,office publisher.
ect. All seem to missing something. The big question is the software and
printer used. The Post script printers (Apple Writer.) seems best in most
instances, but cost much more than for instance an HP series II or Compat-
able. Does anyone have a laser printer they are using with Ventura Publisher
and what printer are you using. How is the quality ?
 Thanks:

SFT Netware will not run on a turbo card 286 or not. Netware is a
protected mode moerating system and expects a FULL AT or PS/2 class
hardware platform. 16 bit buss and all. You will have to get a REAL
286 machine as a server

to COLIN SCHROEDER re: R/VM/386

My understanding is that the big companies are all trying to get their
VGA as the standard. So in fact, there isn't a standard! And this is
the whole problem. It is also tough to buy a VGA now, as a lot of
programs are not compatible with some VGA boards. If you want more
info. I'll look it up for you.

Msg 42384 is 12 line(s) on 08/27/89 from BILL WOLFF
to JIM SACKETT re: R/INFO ON DTP

I have had the same problem with my HP Lasar Printer II and using GEOS.
The problem is that the DTP uses the same dot density as your dot
matrix printer. Yes, the program can do better, but that's up to the
software author. For GEOS, they added another program called GEOLASER
which takes standard GEOS files and dump them to an Apple Lasar (only.
sigh.) and then the dot density comes out at 300 DPI. I guess like
you, I bought the wrong program and the wrong printer.

I guess thats life in the big chipville!

FOR SALE: One like new HP Lasar Printer. CHEAP!
 One GEOPUBLISH with Apple driver for laser printer.
