]Ward, do you know a national publication that lists "all" bbs's by
category? I am looking for some unusual ones, can't always tell from
the bbs name, especially since often multi-word titles are often used.
P.S. By category I mean special interest area (I guess that's too
obvious). Sorry if I should've posted this as an open msg. You have
my OK to move it to main msg base if you like -- maybe other people
have same problem I do. Thanks.

Msg 41921 is 15 line(s) on 06/10/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to CHARLIE KESTNER re: CBBS USAGE

I don't get it. You do the or;* trick, but ^K out of the 1-liners? The
table of msgs to retrieve is built right after EACH line is typed. Thus,
^K SHOULD take you to the list of so-far captured msg #'s, and continue.
 CBBS looks for 'any' character after ^Sing, so ^Q is not specifically
recognized, but it DOES match the criteria "any" after ^S, with the exception
of specific chars such as ^K which of course is handled. I can't imagine
what causes you to bomb back to the menu on CBBS. Strange.
 Welcome back!
 BTW, issued while reviewing the msg body itself, ^C should skip to the
next msg header, but ^K will always bomb back to the menu.
 If you want a way to continue where you left off with 90% efficiency,
just R the next msg by #, then use the '.' command when asked for the
next msg #. Matter of fact, if I'm not interested in the current message
(I DO read them all, but when occasionally re-reading.) I press C
then . - CBBS now has type-ahead, so it should catch the . pretty well.

to CHARLIE KESTNER re: NEW SYSTEM

What are you thinking of getting, now that you've decided to spend a few
bucks this year on a new system? Going a 386, I presume? VGA? 600 Meg
disk? (grin - the disk could take your whole budget).

Msg 41923 is 28 line(s) on 06/10/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: T1000 ADVICE?

I was fortunate enough to be able to pick up a used T1000 laptop with 768K
HardRam (non-volatile Ram disk).
 Boy, is this a slick machine (if ANY 4.77MHz machine can be called "slick").
 It has 512K of memory, one 720K diskette, and a rather scrunched (aspect
ratio) 80 x 25 super twist screen.
 It has full DOS 2.11 in ROM! There's 192K for DOS, so perhaps 256K of ROMS
total (i.e. BIOS, etc). Cleverly, config.sys "points" to 160 bytes in non-
volatile HardRam! Also, the C: autoexec.bat uses the "if exists" to see
if there's a D: autoexec, so even though DOS is in ROM, config & autoexec
can be in HardRam! Very clever!
 I have the 768K add-on memory, which can be used as follows:
 - populate out 128K to the 512 to have 640K DOS if you need to
 - hav some as EMS (not sure what level i.e. 3.x, 4.0?)
 - have the rest be a non-volatile ram disk.
I have created 4-5 subdirectories on the HardRam, with all my frequently
used utilities, and have about 200K working disk space left.
 Anyone else have one?
 Any recommendations for software for a "small" laptop?
 I'd LOVE to have a TEENY compiler to write little text and directory
manipulation programs for it!
 The whole "idea" of the machine is to "get by" with minimal diskette
activity, thus maximizing battery life, but if you always run off of
diskette (such as having a Turbo C or Pascal compiler on A:) then you will
be severely cutting into your battery life.
 I also would like to find, or write, a program that would copy off all
modified files to the corresponding directories on the floppy - but come
to think of it, the unsupported DOS XCOPY command would do that (it doesn't
run, saying "incorrect DOS version").

Msg 41924 is 18 line(s) on 06/10/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to PAUL TEN EYCK re: R/XTALK XMODEM CONSIDERATIONS 

What Xtalk means, is that Xmodem is a public domain protocol, so you
"shouldn't bug them for the protocol details".
 What you should do is call "The Ward Board CBBS" at (312) 849-1132,
and look over the low-numbered messages, where CBBS original cksum
protocol is documented, then another msg shows how CRC is done. No one
who has read that and been serious about doing it, has NOT succeeded in
writing an XMODEM protocol program from that documentation.
 To put it another way, anyone who has asked me "further" questions,
I've usually been able to read "to them" from the documentation.
 If you want to support a newer variation on Xmodem called "Relaxed
Xmodem", then you need to extend my inter-character timeout from one
second to perhaps 30 seconds. This was done for those (rare) times
XMODEM is used across a packet network (like Compuserve) and you might
have delays at unexpected times (unexpected compared to two dedicated
micros xmodemmingback and forth).
 P.S. I invented the MODEM.ASM program, which implemented the MODEM
protocol, but darn me for making it such a dumb name. Keith Petersen
varied the name to Xmodem for a special program, and THAT name stuck.

to MATT KRUEGER re: R/DISPLAY POSTSCRIPT

I saw Display Posscript demoed by Adobe, but heck, they were using a
3 megabyte 386, and doing nothing BUT display postscript! It kind of
scared me for the future of Display Postscript, i.e. in that it seemed
HUGE!
 Then another time - wish I could remember where - I saw some program
USING display postscript - perhaps it was the neXt machine - and it seemed
to work just fine!
 Since Adobe, the Father of Postscript, doesn't from what I see, have
must to "deliver" at this time, you are probably out of luck. But then
I'm not tuned into the whole world.

Msg 41926 is 07 line(s) on 06/10/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/EXPERIENCE W/SUN?

The IBM model 80 can only have 648M of storage, unless you go with the
slick CORE Bus Master ESDI controller, which can support two 650 meg
drives (I saw it at the PS/2 forum). They transfer at 15 megabits, and
have a new one at 20 megabits, compared to the 10 standard on IBM's
ESDI (which is 2x as fast as the normal ST-506 controllers).
 Are you on ChiNet (Randy Suess' {co-inventor of CBBS} Unix system)?
 Randy is very knowledgable, and has worked with a variety of systems.

Msg 41927 is 10 line(s) on 06/10/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JIM SACKETT re: R/INFO ON STARTING A BBS

Beats me. I'm running the same code essentially as from 1978. I'm
sure that while it is fun to still drive a model T, you're probably
more interested in a 4 cylinder turbo charged efficient machine that
takes no-lead. Ask "ALL" rather than me specifically.
 No, the program used here is not available. You probably don't have
a CP/M 8080 lying around, anyway, do you?
 The time required to maintain the system? Depends upon what the
capabilities of the system are, can make an order of magnitued change
in the maintenance time. For example, if you have file uploads, it could
take you tons of time to 'clear' them.

Msg 41928 is 04 line(s) on 06/10/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to DAN SEIBOLD re: R/HELP WITH DIP SWITCH SETTING

The guide to operations has MANY pages of switch settings related to memory
in the machine. For example, if you have 640K total with 256K on the
mama board, the switches are set to sw1=xx00xxxx and sw2=10110000.
If 512K total, sw2 would be 10001000.

Msg 41929 is 05 line(s) on 06/10/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JIM JOYCE re: R/BOOT UP PROBLEM ON XT

The most common problem I've seen is that after FDISKing the disk,
people who establish their own partitions, don't realize that FDISK didn't
make the partition ACTIVE. The section of FDISK "display partitions" should
show an "A" in the "Active" column. If it is not there, the C: disk will
be accessible, but not bootable.

Msg 41932 is 15 line(s) on 06/1/89 from KEVIN KEYSER
to BILL WOLFF re: COMMODORE

Hi Bill, No I didn't know that the C-128 was able to store 10
different formats of CP/M. That IS quite impressive!
You are also correct about the RAM expansion. Just plug in the card
and away you go. I'm running 640K here, myself.
 You mentioned GEOS. I must say that the C-128 version is VERY impressive!
I use it here all the time. I have the RAM set up as a RAM disk.
With this setup the speed of the system is very fast. My favorite
GEOS utility is the Computer Eyes driver. With it and my computer eyes
board and camera I am able to capture and digitalize objects
(People to!) with good resolution.
 Finally, I agree with you about Commodore DOS being on ROM. While this
does make the drives more expensive, it is more reliable (and less prone to
Virus attack!)

Msg 41934 is 19 line(s) on 06/11/89 from BILL WOLFF
to KEVIN KEYSER re: R/COMMODORE

Hi Kevin;

Using Computer Eyes driver, huh? That sounds very interesting! I have a B&W
TV camerma, but it isn't hooked up to anything! Perhaps we can upload and
download some files sometime. I have a demo version of JUGG'LER for the
C-128 in CP/M mode that will format, copy, and report what kind of CP/M
format on a unknown disk is. The demo isn't full featured, but still good.
The full version supports 130 different disk formats and includes some 3
1/2 inch types. Also I believe single density is included, but a minor mod
needs to be done to the drive.

Speaking about drives, one of my C1571 disks drives wouldn't read about 5%
of CP/M or GEOS disks. Regular CBM disks okay! Well after years of not
knowing what was wrong (computer, disks, or what), it turned out to be my
disk drive curcuit board. No it isn't fixed, but I switched it with a drive
I hardly use. I know which chips it's not. Since this problem won't normally
come up and if it did, how you would prove it without a lot of time, I
wonder how many other poor people have the same problem. And think it is
bad disks I did.
