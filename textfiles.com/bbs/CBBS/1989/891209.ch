I DON'T use the SHELL just because I don't use shells! It is mem
res I think if you want to use it and only a few K. A WINDOWS on an
XT "I think" would be a waste. Don't think there is any extended
mem for it to use! If you only run program that require under
570K use it on an XT. I have 4.01 on an XT and 386. The XT has
enpanded mem for my RAM drive so I have enough (just enough)
memory to use now.

Ward,
 I'm interested in knowing how much hardfile space QuatroPro takes
for it's files.
 Could you break it down:
f*
 Full install including Demo files and tutorial
 Less tutorim{.
 Less tutorial and demo files.
 Bare bones.

Thanks,
James

Hi James;

If this helps, EA-EASY-AS is a Lotus clone (even runs Lotus files) and i
shareware for $40. It is found on many BBSs and runs on 256K or more. More
is better. Otherwise your disk runs a lot! It only needs one file (bare-
bones) running. Under 200K if I remember right! <BW>
