For sure, you'll need a new controller. "Compaticard" is the one I hear
of. The simple problem is that the PC doesn't have a dual-speed controller,
and as such can't write at the 2x data rate required by 1.2M and 1.44M
diskette drives.
 I have no personal experience - I'm speaking from a (fuzzy) memory of
this stuff - but I AM sure of the controller issue - you DO need a new one!

"10-Net and Paradox won't work together". What do you mean "won't work
together"?
 The reason I ask: do you mean for example you can't run it locally while
the network is up? Or that you can't access a file on the server? Or
just what?
 You DO know that you can't SHARE databases unless they are designed for
it and the program running KNOWS it is running on a network, right? In other
words, you'd be unable to open the databases when a 2nd program started.

print using a pen like device then stored this as ascii which was down
loadable to a computer. Does anyone know who makes it and if it is
commercially available?

As I said, I haven't seen the situation yet. I'm now an 'outside
consultant for XXX, so they call me up when they need something. I
believe the person who set it up would be aware of that problem, but
I have to get ahold of him for further details. I'll let you know
more when _I_ know more. Thanks for the thoughts, though.
.
BTW, is it taking CBBS longer to wake up or what? The last few times
I have called in, it's taken more than a couple of CR's to get a
response.

Yep, A USR 9600 baud modem was put on CBBS last weekend, and it does
seem to take a few more C/R's. I don't understand why! I only ask for
"any" 3 chars, so when it takes 6, I'm stumped!

Msg 41397 is 10 line(s) on 02/23/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to BARRY POLLACK re: UPLOAD/SEND

CBBS doesn't support file uploads.
 If you wanted to upload MSGS, then most commo program should be able
to handle it - just use the ? char for the "go ahead" char, and put a
teensy delay between chars since CBBS isn't interrupt driven. I do it
all the time.
 One POSSIBLE problem with the ? prompt would be that if it is at the
end of a line, it might be seen when echoed rather than the ? on the
next line. But fiddle (and of course ABORT any msgs that aren't what
you wnat).
 Good luck.

This may sound elementary, but have you verified that you can indeed acesss
files across the network? Also make sure that paradox is set for the right
drive (I'm guessing that C on one machine becomes D on the other). I've
found that setting up 10-net involves a fair amount of trial and error.

CFOG meets in the meeting room on the second floor.

Msg 41401 is 11 line(s) on 02/23/89 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to WARD/ERIC/ALL re: R/R/10-NET

OK, I have a little more information. The message that Paradox puts
out when it tries to load on the network is:
UNEXPECTED CONDITIONS: index of Fd
and then it locks up. Same thing from EITHER end of the network
when Paradox is started. Again, I haven't seen this, I'm taking the
other folks' word for it. Eric's suggestion that PARADOX might not
know about the change in drive designations is possible, except that
(they tell me) Paradox HAS been installed for network operation. As
for file access, I think they have that one worked out. The problem
seems to be that something happens that prevents Paradox from loading
at ALL when 10-NET is running. Further ruminations, anyone?

"Installed for network operation" doesn't mean it knows about the drive.
I assume that all it means is that the program will use record locks and
the like. If the configuration says that it expects to find its files
on drive C, and you're running it on drive D (mapped by the network to be
another machine's drive C), it will fail.
