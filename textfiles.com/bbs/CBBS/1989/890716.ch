Ward,
 Thank you for the kind replies to all my questions. I saw several
good references to you in "Master Guide to Free Software" by Glossbrenner.
This is a good book for its historical notes and perspective on the best
of shareware.
 Echo mail is a system BBS linked for the purpose of relaying E-mail. Sort
of a primative informal and slower EasyPlex. CIS is obviously more r
reliable but the potentioal of a user-supported E-mail system shouldn't
be discounted yet. I have hopes that having consumed Source, CIS might
see the wisdom of reducing rates to encourage new customers. Perhaps it
doesn't work that way. While on the subject, when does Prodigy arrive in
Chicago?
 I am a missionary to Pakistan. The possibility of international E-mail is
of real interest to me. Phone calls run $10 per min FROM Pakistan to USA.
Any cheaper methods would really help.
 Apparently ProComm announces that it (ProComm) has logged on CBBS. Sure
faked me out.
 Now I begin the process of looking for DeskJet Plus drivers for the software
that I use.Thank you.

 I wouldn't be surprised to find continuous form transparencies (ie rolls. But
my DeskJet wouldn't "eat" the stuff. The plastic for use in photocopiers costs
about $1 per sheet and is not re-usable. Actually, I wish I could get a used 2
pin HP or IBM plotter for cheap. Then I would use "washable" pens and reuse the
plastic. I'm a teacher and would go through over 400 sheets each year. I may go
with the photocopier on things that I could use next year.

 A buck a sheet? Jeez.
 I found this stuff @ Jacobson's (and Indiana office supplies dealer) for
~$15.00 for 50 sheets. You are buying your stuff at the wrong place. Try Arveys.

I am selling a VGA PLUS card from Paradise System Inc.  The Card is in perfect
condition, and I am selling because I am upgrading to a $500 better VGA Card.
Please write a message to me if you are at all interested,  I am selling Dirt
Cheap.  Thanks For your Time,

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/<$50 PC SPEECH SYNTH

Ward-  Sorry to tell you tthis, but I got a COVOX SPEECH KEY MASTER. I just
thought Id tell you what it does, and maybe it might help you. First, you put
it in `PROGRAMMING' mode.  Next, you say a word into the operator like
microphone/headphone thing, then you type what the word means in computer
language.  The MACRO is saved on disk, in memory, etc.. When you want to do
something the MACRO can do, just say the word.  It works (so far) on
Sierra-On-Line Games, SmartCom ][, Lotus 1-2-3, multimate Advantage ][, Norton
Disk Utilities, DOS 4.01,
  Atari games for the IBM PC, and many, many, more.  In fact, I am using The
Price Is: $101.76 w/ tax!! great deal (huh)... Adam Dada-104.3 WJMK right now
on this system!!!!!.  The cool part is it's price:

Msg 42098 is 16 line(s) on 07/15/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to ALL re: HD HELP

Just installed another 40 meg Miniscribe 3650 HD in my XT clone. Got the wires
and all correct but the DiskManager wouldn't format them properly so went out
and got DOS 4.01 which did the job great! I didn't load the SHELL which seems
to be half the cost and "manual".
  My problem is: I am not sure of the values to use when doing a low level
format with DEBUG. I guessed at the "write precomp cylinder" using 128 (maybe
"0" for miniscribe?). I also used the default correctable error burst length
AND CCB option byte step rate (5).
  Does anyone know for sure the Write Precomp Cylinder value to use? I will
probably spend a lot of time on the phone trying to find this out. The drives
seem to run well using that "128" value I used but haven't tested the sys yet
(not restored yet) to see if it is good enough.
  Really.... not bad for a FIRST time format like this!
