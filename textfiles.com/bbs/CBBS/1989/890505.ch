I have an IBM and a good wide carriage printer. I would like the print
head to last as long as possible so I want to make use of an old Commodore
printer I have collecting dust, for running labels ect .
I have tried to interface it with no success. Is the commodore a synchro-
nous printer ?
Is it possible to interface this at all ? Maybe someone can help !

Msg 41763 is 07 line(s) on 05/03/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to JIM SACKETT re: R/COMMODORE PTR TO IBM RS232

Commodore printers have such strange interface requirements (a clocked
bidirectional serial bus that's nothing like RS-232) that any interface
kludge would cost you more than picking up a used Centronics printer. Which
reminds me, I have an Okidata ML82 that I'd like to get rid of. Works just
fine; it's features are a bit limited due to its age (draft mode only, no
graphics, etc.). If interested, call me at 251-5787 and make an offer (asking
asking no more than $75).

There's a CP/M program that will get you DIRECTORIES of ZIP files;
available on the ZNODEs in town. Also, there has been some word that
the ZIP algorithm isn't all that different from that for .ARC files.
I would expect to see a CP/M zipper of one sort or another arrive
within a month or two.

You can get (or rent) multi-format VCRs and TVs. They ain't cheap, but
they exist. There are also service companies that will convert a
PAL or SECAM format tape to NTSC VHS (that's what we use in the US).
Look in the Yellow Pages under Video Tape Duplicating Services (page 2075
Chicago Consumer Book 1989).

to ERIC BOHLMAN re: COMMODORE PRINTER

Eric, you live dangerously, Commodore on CBBS - tut-tut.
Seriously, your basic problem is that commodore use a variant of ASCII called
by some PETSCII (for Commodore Pet). It has , I believe, high & low bits
reversed so even if you did print it would look like this.
wITH THE HIGH AND LOW BITS REVERSED CAPS BECOME LOWERCASE AND LOWERCASE BECOME
CAPS, eRIC. You might get a Commodre interface that converts PETSCII to ASCII
Parralel and then an Parralel to Serial converter - Nah why bother, Most
Commodore printers don't have lower case descenders anyway.

Jim Flanagans' remarks. Sorry you took . As far as the printer
you have for sale, I'm not sure just yet. I figured if I could make use o
the commodore printer I would. I may be getting a Diconix desk jet from
work now anyway (Eastman Kodak). I'll let you know though. I have a
friend that may want your printer, I'll ask him too.

One Meg of memory, 3.5" 1.44 Meg and 360k floppies, 71 MByte Micropolis drive.

I'll throw in a genuine used IBM mono monitor, too. The board has a

the machine for a project that never materialized, and would like to unload it
and get some cash. $1500 takes it.

Msg 41774 is 07 line(s) on 05/04/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to JIM FLANAGAN re: R/COMMODORE PRINTER

What the person wanted to do was adapt a Commodore printer to be used as
a spare with another (presumably IBM-compatible) system. Character codes
are the least of the problem there; it would take a custom daa format
converter that would cost more than getting a standard printer. Converters
that go the other way (adapt standard printers to Commodore computers) are
plentiful, which says something unflattering about the quality of Commodore's
printers.

Msg 41775 is 06 line(s) on 05/04/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to ANDY SHAPIRO re: CP/M ZIP

Remember that PKZIP can use two different compression methods. I suspect
that "shrinking" is just a minor variant of the "squashing" method used in
PKARC, which is LZW compression with a maximum 13-bit code size; that could
be handled with no problem. But there's also "reducing" and I have no idea
as to the memory requirements involved there; it uses a totally different
(non-LZW) method.

Kevin;

There is a zipper and a unzipper for the Commodore computers. The version
I have runs on the C64 computer. I don't know of one that runs in the
native C128 mode, but if you hear of one, please let me know. The zipper
program has been out at least a year or more for the Commodores. You may
want to call Protecto's BBS at 382-3270 for a copy. Please note the
SYSOP there will probablly not answer any mail you send. The reason?
Your guess is as good as mine. <BW>

Jim, didn't I talk to youon CCBS? Any way, your problem is not unique!
Amiga users are going through the same thing. Wanting to use their old
Commodore stuff with RS-232. I believe their solution is buying a
interface just for that. Guessing I think it cost $20-$50 range. Check
out some Amiga BBS's and magazines. <BW>

Thanks for the Amiga tip. I have been on several boards looking for help.
I figured someone has had to have gone through this question before.
I have played around with computers for years now and know there aren't
to many new problems that haven't been solved somewhere before. Asking
around can save a lot of time and hair ! I like to tinker around with
building things so an interface isn't out of the question yet. I recently
built an artificially intelligent toy car from an Omni magazine artical.
You may remember it advertised as a robot with insect inteligence.
It can make you think something is really in here!
Well thanks again for the tip. Talk to you again some time.

Glad I could help. I build things myself, but more into programming
now. If you are going to chech this board for awhile, I see what I
can find in the magazines? I think Commodore or INFO had something.

Kevin;

That's because the Commodore 128 is a very powerful computer. Then
adding another 512K to make it to 640K on a 8-bit computer! Wow!
You know have one of the most powerful 8-bit computer around. Plus
it runs four powerful operating systems C64, C128, CP/M and GEOS.
You got a great computer Kevin!

I've got a client who just got a Desk Jet II, fast UPS delivery and all.
I'm not sure exactly what he paid, but it was about $700. I'll know soon
since I'm installing some equipment at his office.
