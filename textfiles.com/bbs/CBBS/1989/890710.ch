]Chaz: I picked up the BBS list and reformatted it (went from 29K to
19K) but the line noise is too bad for me to attempt an upload - I'd
just be afraid of too many typos.  Not sure what to do.  I think the
line noise is partly due to the high temperature.

Nulls is a msg related to seeing an N or ^N while CBBS types - it is a quick
way to get 'em, then, to make sure you REALLY wanted 'em (since on most
terminal programs they are invisible BUT cause slower transmission) I ask.
 No big deal. Musta been line noise. We're back on an old Courier external
2400 awaiting the return of the 9600 HSTs.
 The board was down for a week or so due to the modem glitch, followed by
the fact that when turned off for a few days, the hard drive refused to
start up again, sigh.

If you are still looking for a consultant I may be of help.
Previously I was the in-house consultant for computer store.
I am an expert in Turbo Pascal, have several published programs
and learn almost anything needed for microcomputers. Give me a
call to see if we can help each other. 743-4241.

Msg 42043 is 22 line(s) on 07/09/89 from DONNIE STUHLMAN
to ALL re: WARNING ABOUT COMPUTER STORE

In selecting a microcomputer vendor one should be very careful
about how they treat both their customers and staff. DOS
Computer Centers of Park Ridge and Niles are in serious financial
staights. All their vendors have them on credit hold. It is
difficult for them to deliver product. All their good service
and support staff have left for greener pastures. They have a
bare bones sales staff that probably does have the time to take
care of you. They treat their staff poorly, keeping them in the
dark about the real problems. The sales staff is forced to
withold the truth from customers.
 I am a highly skilled microcomputer specialist now looking for
a new job. I've been using micros for over eleven years. I
have masters and bachelors degrees from Columbia University
(New York City). My specialties are desktop publishing, infor-
mation flow, word processing, and problem solving.
 If you want to know the "emes" leave a message here. If you
know of a job or just want to chat about the industry give me a
call at 743-4241.

to ALL re: MODEMS

I have trouble with my modem(s). I wonder if anyone can tell me what to do
I have a 2400 baud from Computer Direct and a 9600 Racal-Vadic from work
Neither one works over 1200 baud more than once or twice. The 9600 works
fine when I use it with the Televidio dumb terminal connected to a main}if
frame 4381. I even have trouble at 1200 at times. MatX}Bell says I can get
a ~"i}ei>d}olpnditioned line{_ but it will cost me. What should
I do? I have gotten something called 'NONOISE' from ather board and
it would require surg}i{_eory on thphone line.

Msg 42046 is 15 line(s) on 07/10/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to BILL WODARCZYK re: R/MODEMS

The first thing to do is to establish whether the problem is in your phone
line or in your modems. There are two ways to do that: 1) borrow a modem
(preferably from a different vendor than the ones you have), connect it to
your line, and see what performance you get 2) (possibly easier) take your
modems over to someone else's line and try them out.
If the line is the problem, check whether there's enough noise to inter-
fere with voice communications. If there is, the phone company will have
to fix it (they AREN'T obligated to fix problems that affect data only
unless you're paying extra for what amounts to a guarantee that they will).
You might check with vendors to see if they have some line noise filters.
Come to think of it, I have one lying around somewhere; I picked it up at a
hamfest.
Finally, don't judge your modems by their performance on connects to this BBS.
Right now it's running on a borrowed modem and has unusually severe line
noise, which should go away once Ward gets his regular modem fixed.

Msg 42048 is 18 line(s) on 07/10/89 from JEAN BARBER
to JAMES SCHMIDT re: R/SUPERCALC 5 OPINION(S)

There is a product called TWIN from Mosaic Software, Inc. 1972 Massachusetts
Ave. Cambridge, MA 02140 which seems to be disk based and looks, tastes and
acts like lotus, except for some menu handling. I like their drop down
because it looks like the Wordstar drop down. They put it on two disks for
my portable at my request. I have LOTUS on my hard drive. So far
neither me nor my accountant (he uses LOTUS exclusively) that did not work
alike. He is quite apt at writing MACROS. OOps, I left out the verb found
in previous sentence. But, I think you will get the message. By the way
they have an integrated package for only a few dollars more with databases,
wordprocessors, etc. For my purposes I did not need so did not buy it. 
Local software houses can get it for you. But they seem to be willing to
sell direct, also. Their phone 617-491-2434. Their version 3 came out
before LOTUS. I am using version 2 in Lotus and Advantage in TWIN.

Thanks for your good reply on CIS about printing on plastic.
I think that I am going to get a DeskJet and use the IBM
plastic you mentioned. Could you find the product name and number
for me? Also what PC users groups in the Chicago suburbs would you
suggest or recommend? I live in Wheaton (missionary on furlough from
Pakistan.) My phone is 665-4462 and my CIS # 71301,1742
Thanks. Brent Jones

Msg 42050 is 20 line(s) on 07/10/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to BRENT JONES re: R/W. SUBURBS USER GROUP?

Gee, I don't know about west suburban user groups. I live in the far
south suburbs, and "far west" (Wheaton, Schaumburg, etc) are like in
another state for me.
 The PC club I am most involved in meets at the University of Chicago,
59th St. and almost the lake, so you can see why I like that one.
 There's also CACHE, the oldest club in Chicago, which meets sort of
"Central" - DeVry, at about Belmont and Western (actually on Campbell
one block west), "3300 N. Campbell, approx 2500 west". They have a BBS,
not sure if it is members-only. 470-1691.
 There is also a (I think larger) club in the Chicago area, which
probably has "chapters" in various areas - I remember hearing of one in
Harvey (far south where I am) but I'm not sure where to get you started
on finding that one, since I'm not directly involved in it, except when
asked to speak a few years ago. They tend to meet in the evening after
work downtown, dunno about the "chapters". Hopefully someone else will
answer your msg.
 To find the info on that plastic, call IBM direct 1-800-IBM-2468 and
ask for their plotter transparencies. (Gad, the line noise is awful
today, I'm constantly editing out glitches! Must be the heat, and the
fact that our MNP (error correcting) modem is on the fritz).

Msg 42051 is 13 line(s) on 07/10/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to BILL WODARCZYK re: R/MODEMS

Does 300 baud work OK? Sounds just like you have a noisy line. If you
can't find the noise on a VOICE call then the phone company won't fix
it for you. I know of ONE case where there was a bad "trunk" line between
my area (far south) and CBBS (near north) and they WERE willing to find
it because it went "tic.tic.tic" on a VOICE call. If your voice calls
are noisy, then report it and forget about the modem - THEN try the modem
again.
 Your only other possibility is, if the line isn't TOO bad, to go to an
error correctinng modem and only call into systems that support error
correction (ARQ or MNP) (ARQ is US Robotics name for MNP), such as
this board (though our error correcting modem died and is in for service)
or others. That may slow down things, but short of a disconnect, you
stop getting line noise.

to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/MODEMS

 Eric, could you put a couple spaces at the front of a new paragraph?
 Look at your msg 42046 - your very vaulable info is slightly less readable
due to being just blocks of lines. Don't put in blank lines - that
just spreads out the msg - but a couple space indent should work fine.
 Thanks for your helpful participation in CBBS!
