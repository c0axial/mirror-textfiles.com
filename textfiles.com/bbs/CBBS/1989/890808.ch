to WARD re: READING MESSAGES

    I have not called you BBS much and f*though ~rI would like to, the
one thing which bugs me though is not being able to continually read
messages starting from some given message number. Is that possible? Doing
some tinkering it seems that one would have to use an "o;1" and write down
the message numbers of interest. In my case my communications program does
have a scroll back buffer. It would still be nice to read messages one
after the other.

Msg 42238 is 11 line(s) on 08/06/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: SOFTWARE CAROUSEL?

Anyone else using Software Carousel?  I'm having problems trying to
figure out what programs to load in my autoexec, and which to load in
"each partition".
  The main programs I want are: CED, CTRLALT, and STACKEY.  CED seems to
have taken over the low level keyboard I/O, so the "switch partition"
hot key doesn't work until I press enter, if I'm at the DOS prompt (which
actually isn't too bad).
  What kind of partitions do you set up?  A couple small ones for DIR and
things like that?  One with your favorite DOS directory tree program
resident?  A BIG one for commo programs which might shell to DOS, etc?
  Thanks!

Msg 42243 is 09 line(s) on 08/07/89 from GARY ELFRING
to ED FOSTER re: MANUAL

My manual is now perfect bound for a couple of very good reasons. I used
to have 2 saddle stiched manuals that totaled about 62 pages. They cost
$3.25 per set to be printed. The perfect bound manual (1 for all 62 pages)
looks MUCH more professional and the cost- $0.68 each!  Saddle stiched m
manuals work well up to 50 - 60 pages, but are expensive to make (labor).
Perfect bound manuals must have a minimum of 64 pages, and are cheap to
make. (Minimum quantity 1000, at least 64 pages, and pages must move up in
increments of 16.)  To get my programs stocked on dealer shelves they want
nice packaging, professional looking manuals, etc. Now I qualify.

(no "sysop" here, I'm "Ward").
 Well, I just am not that familiar with the boards - but check out the
msgs starting at 42053. It is a list of Chicago area bbs's. Maybe one
of the names will sound like something appropriate. I just don't know
where to go for a "C" programming related BBS.
 P.S. sorry your 42203 disappeared - an assistant operator must have
zapped it - for being "too cutesie", or having borders, lines of -'s,
lots of space-and-time-wasting centering, or "something". We like simple
"net" messages.

I am thinking of getting the Sota 386 accelerator board for a Compaq Deskpro.
this is the original 8086 Deskpro and most of the accelerator cards don't work

Msg 42247 is 07 line(s) on 08/08/89 from BENJAMIN COHEN
to ALL re: WORDSTAR 4 ^QT HELP

Has anyone any idea about how to patch WS4 to get the ^QT command to
delete UP TO the specified character instead of deleting up to AND
INCLUDING the specified character. I often find that the last character
that I want deleted is not unique to the string but the NEXT character that
I don't want deleted usually is. VDE works the way I'd like WS to work:
you press ^QT and then the delete goes from the cursor position UP TO the
next occurence of the specified character.

Msg 42248 is 09 line(s) on 08/08/89 from DONALD CROSS
to DAVID GIBBS re: R/PROGRAMMING JOB NEEDED

David,
 I've never worked on S/36's. My experience is on IBM 4341's
DEC, and DG mini's, and IBM PCs, XTs, ATs, PS/2s and clones. I've
worked with COBOL, Assembler, BASIC, Quick BASIC, some C, FoxBase. The
last couple of projects I put together linked the micros to the mainframe
with Tempus Link.
 Anyway, all that is the long way of saying that I haven't worked
with S/36s or RPG (unfair assumption?). I pick things up quickly,
but I'm not sure I would find RPG too attractive. Any suggestions?

to GRAHAM GAMBLE re: 'C' BOARD

I don't recall your message to which Ward replied, but if you're looking
for a BBS with a 'C' emphasis and don't mind an East Coast call, I recall
reading about one such board (which even puts out an interesting
newsletter on 'C'). I don't off-hand recall all the specifics, but they're
readily available in a file on a BBS I run (contact info below) in a file
called CNEWSLTR.LBR, found in the C0: directory. (After exiting the
message base, type 'GO C0:' or 'GO NEW' to get there. If unfamiliar with
BBSes running under CP/M, you probably first should type 'HELP' after
exiting the msg base program to learn about LDIR and TYPE commands as they
relate to '.LBR' files-somewhat like '.ARC' files, but with different
syntax requirements.).I've also heard about a 'programmers' BBS' located
in the western Chicago suburbs which reportedly has healthy 'C'
discussions. Someone here may be able to provide you with name and/or
phone number. (If not, I'm sure someone on my BBS can help, as that's
how I first heard of it.) Good luck.
