to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/COPYRIGHT FORMS

I wasn't aware there was a top & bottom margin requirement. The source listing
I submitted didn't have very much space at the top and bottom. I guess it must
have been sufficient. The copyright registration went through without hitches.

Msg 41343 is 19 line(s) on 02/13/89 from JERRY OLSEN
to MURRAY ARNOW ET AL. re: R/COPYRIGHT

Within a fairly significant period of time (a year or years), you can
always register a copyright even after your original copyright attains.
The circumstances of an author help dictate the most prudent course,
as well as the relative "commercialness" of a given work. The latter is
fairly self evident. As for the former, many of us of course grind out
stuff on a regular basis which, even though we want to retain control of
it (partially so others at least legally can't bastardize it), experience
dictates it just ain't commercially noteworthy. Unless and until it at
least suggests it will be, it's money not well spent, at least in my
view. I have the better part of a dozen programs written for use on a
BBS I run, for example, which I don't expect will ever make me <or>
anyone else $, even though they're well written.In those cases, I've
"reserved" the copyright for protection while giving out occasional copies
-just in case.Note, BTW, that until a program is really <stable>,
registering a copyright only expends the extra measure of protection to
that which was submitted; future changes-often rather substantial-have
no more protection than before registration. Now if someone's <rich>,
gee, they could spend a few hundred $ over each year just protecting
the changes (grin). Regards.

to ALL re: MORE COPYRIGHT

Decided to get off my rear and walk across the room after logging off.
Sec. 412 of the 1976 Act (paraphrased for brevity) indicates that an
author may retain full rights in all respects if s/he registers the
copyright (1) before an alleged infringement or (2) within 3 months of
when it first was published, whichever is later. Legal difference
between the two? If <not> so registered, the author's remedies from the
court are limited to (1) injunction and (2) actual damages. (Read the
latter as the amount for which s/he was ripped off.) If formal registration
is timely and proper, s/he also can petition for attorney's fees and
statutory damages. (Read those as penalties.) Clearer now to us all, I
trust.

to MURRAY ARNOW re: R/COPYRIGHT FORMS

The Federal form disn't specify any margins but the file I read did.
With all the messages on copyright, it looks like it is a subject
needed to bring out the pros and cons on. The revisions don't
always need to be resubmitted if I understand it correctly, just
the major revisions. I would consider 1-2 years long enough to
protect a new IDEA. If anyone wants it in that time they will
either TAKE it or buy it. I won't even put the copyright notice
on shareware anymore, haven't even received negative comments on
any of it. If they want it in the compiled version they can have
THAT. The two ideas I used were new and in an area no one writes
small programs for. The copyright lets me sleep knowing that
the two large companies that write astrology software won't take
over the idea if sales become profitable enough for them to do
so.
 It would be interesting to hear from ANYONE who had infringements
and what the copyright or no copyright did for them.
 
Msg 41348 is 13 line(s) on 02/13/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to BILL WOLFF re: R/DISK MAILERS

 Got so wound up in the copyright stuff I forgot to mention2the disks and
logged off, had to get on again.
 Got a price on the mailers. They will mail out samples of the sizes so I can
check them out for my purposes.
 Qty of 500 for single (maybe 2 disks) is 22 cents plus shipping. Will
probably order 500 of those. Can always sell extras at the computer group
meetings.
 I am looking for a place that has pre-cut corrigated board 5 1/2 x 5 1/2 now.
I can use that in the padded envelopes for the disks (4). That must be quite
cheap if I get 1000 pieces, probably the smallest order possible unless I
resort to having them cut somewhere.
 Heck, maybe I should sell mailers locally at the meetings. Make a few dollars
WHILE there.

Msg 41349 is 10 line(s) on 02/13/89 from MURRAY ARNOW
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/COPYRIGHT FORMS

It is true that minor revisions need not require a new registration. Major
revisions(derivative works) should be registered. Derivative works are in a
sense still protected by the original copyright. For instance, if the earlier
work is copyrighted by someone else and you decide to author a derivative work
you are violating the original copyright if you publish without permission. If
the original author decides to challenge your work in court, your work has no
independent value. I think its a big mistake to not show a copyright notice on
shareware even if it has doubtful value. If your derivative work is to be
copyrighted, you may be challenged by someone who stole your original ideas.
You may then have one hell of a time establishing authorship.

Msg 41350 is 12 line(s) on 02/13/89 from BOB SULLIVAN
to BILL WOLFF re: R/VIRUS PROBLEM SOLVED?

 Years ago I used a PET and a C64. As I recall there is an interrupt vector
that is updated about 60 times per second. I guess a program could somehow
wedge itself into this part of the interpretation loop. Next it could check to
see if it is on the current disk. If not then it could make a copy of itself
(hidden of course) and then fill in the bit map to protect its location. Since
the disk is really only a set of programs and not a booting DOS, insuring its
re-entry into the RAM on the next boot is a problem. Possibly, it could tie
itself to the DIRECTORY, a tie itself to a program, write over a program and
use its name. My point is that wedging into the operating system is no problem
on a Commodore; in fact, it is easier than on an Apple. Reassuring re-entry
into the RAM is possible, too. ROMs may not be a panacea.

to RICHARD GOZDAL re: MAILERS

I use a larger mailer than you are probably looking for (6 1/2 x 9 1/2) h)
however, my experience has been that Calumet Carton & Athropomorphic Sys.
Systems seem to be competing with each other over price, even though
Anthropomorphic systems buys their mailers from Calumet. My last quote for big
mailers (in 1000s) was .23 from Anthro, and .26 from Calumet.

Msg 41353 is 02 line(s) on 02/14/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL

 Well, I guess i WILL put a copyright notice in all work no matter how bad or
small it is.

Msg 41354 is 09 line(s) on 02/14/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to GARY ELFRING re: R/MAILERS

 I might use the larger mailer if it is needed to fit one disk and two sheets
of paper in. Heck, the quote I got wasn't much more for a 500 qty. Whatever,
these prices sure beat 65 cents each in retail stores!
 I got sucker into a large purchase (minimum order price) of cut corrigated
board to put "around" the disks with docs in padded envelopes. Any one need a
lot of 5 3/4 x 5 3/4 pieces of stock for mailing disks? hehe. Still cheaper
than using mailers inside the envelopes (few cents each).
