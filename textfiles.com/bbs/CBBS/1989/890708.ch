]Whatever you did in bringing CBBS back up, Ward, it is now as
clean and clear as any.  No line noise, no weird strings of
characters magically appearing in my command lines, and so on.
thanks...by the way, you might put out a message asking if anyone
knows what the fallout will be from CompuServe's purchase of The
Source.  Source ain't saying.

Msg 42033 is 03 line(s) on 07/08/89 from JERRY OLSEN
to JIM MILLS re: R/PROGRAMMERS WANTED

I believe your msg didn't indicate whether you're interested in full-time
folks, or part-time; also, whether on-premises staff or off-premises
consultants. Can you enlighten? :-)

to WARD re: MISC. STUFF

My msgs began at the proper point on this call, so apparently the glitch
simply related to the "skipped" msg numbers.Will look forward to the DTP
files whenever convenient. I'm in the last day or two of preparing ancillary
files for a shareware package to ship next week, and after that don't want
to THINK about coding for a few days. :-) Hope the vacation's a pleasant
one.

What is Zoo? How ugly is the source code for ARC? Would you know if it's
written in C? Where might I find it? Thanks for your help.

Msg 42036 is 05 line(s) on 07/08/89 from BRENT JONES
to ALL re: PRINTING ON PLASTIC

Can anyone give me suggestions on what printer-24 pin quality
that can print{on clear plastic for transparencies for
overhead projecion. I have only received info that Okidata 393
will work. What else?

Msg 42037 is 06 line(s) on 07/08/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to RICK SURWILO re: R/FILE COMPRESSION

The ARC source code is in fact in C. The "ugly" part is that Thom Henderson
is quite restrictive about what you can use it in, and many people have a
bad taste left in their mouths by his legal action against Phil Katz.
I know I've seen it in some places, but don't remember where.
Zoo is one of several file compression/file combination schemes. I haven't
used it a great deal.

Msg 42038 is 07 line(s) on 07/08/89 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: WELCOME BACK

Ward: It's good to see the board back on line (I presume it was
down for a while, or have hours of operation changed?)
 Anyway, I noticed something which could have been due to line
noise (?), or perhaps an error in the modem: when I was logging on,
I got a message telling me I had asked for 5 nulls, did I really
want 5? so I selected 0. I'm pretty sure I didn't miskey.
Everything else went fine though. Hope all's well.Bye!
