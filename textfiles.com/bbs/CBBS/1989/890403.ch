The most obvious thought is that it would be very easy to end up spending
more money on that type of bargain than on current brand X computers.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/DISK LOGGING IN MS-DOS 3.30

Bill Jawarsky of ICOM suggests that the drive doesn't support line
34-marked "unused" in my disk controller. The only thing I can guess which
uses it is perhaps the door-open line (supported optionly in DRIVPARM
and DRIVER.SYS. I found a copy of EZ Dos 4.0 with DR Dos 3.31. The
disk change problem doesn't occur there. I am reviewing it. It has
a couple of interesting enhancements. It doesn't support code paging,
but, despite poor documentation not mentioning it, appears to support
COM 3 and 4. Plus, if get nostalgic for CP/M, you have ERA and a DIR/w
display which looks like the CP/M DIR display.
As an added bonus, you get SID86-a cross between DEBUG and ZSID.
I'll report after testing it further.

The message below was meant for you on CFOG II, but I found out that I
don't have aceess to the entering of messages. Oh well, hopefully this will
be fixed and you can read this message here, thanks.
 Andy; did you ever use RTX.COM for the PX-8? It uses 14 pages of TPA. You
call it up by CTRL-ESC. It has DIR of RAMDISK, Battery level, printer setup,
RS-232 changes, small DDT program and a remove itself patch. I always keep it
in my PX-8 with the multi-pack. I also use PXUTIL.COM that is a NEWSWEEP type
of program (7K I think) but much better and I hardly ever use STAT or PIP
again. It even reads the proper Kilobytes on the "H" drive.
 I haven't found WS to be bad compared to VDE. VDE is nice, but WS is in
ROM. And WS works just fine for text. Tight on space on the RAMDRIVE?
Erase old file before saving. This will not work on WS V3.3. It says
can not delete the working file. Perhaps I didn't fully test it. File
size on the 3.3 might make a difference.
 The best BASIC games I have found with graphics on the Geneva was
SPSHUT.BAS (Space Shuttle flight game) and YAHTZE.BAS (Yahtzee game on
the Geneva up to 6 players).
 I too would like to have a 64K ROM programmed for me. If you find
someone you like and it's cheap, let me know. I do use DAKCOMM as I
travel a lot and also use TERM with an external modem. I ussually dump
stuff to my Osborne Executive or sometimes to my C-128 too. I am not a
paying CFOG member, but I would like one program for the Osborne to
lay the time in the corner of the screen. I hate to pay $25.00,
or that one program. Chat later! <BW>

to BILL WOLFF re: R/PX-GENEVA-STUFF

Well, let me know the name of the file and maybe I can get it for
you. As for the Geneva - WS is a SLOW PIG compared to VDE; It takes
about 10 seconds for WS to load, and VDE takes _1_! Anyway, WS does
do more, but I'm using my PX-8 for editing only; for printing, everything
goes to the Kaypro. Actually, for editing everything goes to the Kaypro.
This is pretty much a 'writing dump' machine. I haven't seen the first
program you mentioned, but PXUTIL is a little fat for what it does. If
you've seen my list for Ben Cohen, you can see that I have a series of
1K utilities that do the job nicely. Anyway, I have been informed by
Ben of a fellow who will burn a 32K ROM for the PX-8 for $25. I'm
(finally) gonna have my dream portable. I think he'll do 64K chips as
well, I'll let you know. In theory, drive I: can be up to 128 K on a
chip, but I've never seen one of those.
 I've happily avoided games on this machine, though I keep BASIC on hand
just in case I need to do something unforseen, and I don't have anything
else that I'd want to leave in I:. Just gimme VDE and a couple of
small (and I _do_ mean _small_ utilities and I'm happy. I got all that
I wanted into 29K!

to ALL re: CONSULTING FIRM WANTED

I need the name and phone number(s) for a few out-call software
consulting firms in the Chicago area for a project that is starting.

I prefer to avoid general placement services as they don't screen
the people they send out which wastes my time.

Any warning about "problem" companies would also be appreciated.

 Thanks

How about the mostly-unknowledgable user who hoses up his disk and then
decides that the DOS "RECOVER" command will put things back the way
they are suppose to. Need I say more??
