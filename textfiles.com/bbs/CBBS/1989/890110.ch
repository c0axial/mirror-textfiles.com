to JOE DUBECK re: R/LAPTOP CU CONTROL

Yep, I remember seeing that ad. It was prohibitively expensive - I
think $39 (or at least $30). The company name rang a bell - because
they were the ones that put XMODEM on a ROM chip for my HX-20. SkiSoft
(at least SKI something). No further details. Dunno where to START,
except now you could look in PC mags under "Ski.", assuming that's
where, and that they are in the alphabetical advertisers index.

to ALL re: MORE DESKJET

Add Randy to the list of satisfied DeskJet owners. ElekTek, $645.
Also, I've had great success at cartridge reinking, with ordinary
fountain pen ink. I didn't put enough in the first couple times,
then noticed how HEAVY a new cartridge was. Sure enough, a new one
weighs just over 1-3/4 oz, while an empty one is 1 oz or less, so
now I pump ink in (with a blow-torch-stretched-eye-dropper) until I'm
up around 1.5 ozs - in other words, a full half oz of ink. This brings
the "cost of ownership" down, since it cuts about 3 cents off each
page printed ($14+ cartridge prints about 500 pages).

Msg 41130 is 10 line(s) on 01/09/89 from BOB SULLIVAN
to ALL re: IIGS MODEM PROGRAM

 I am looking for a reasonable priced modem program for the
Apple IIGS or an active BBS number where I can get good advice
on purchasing a IIGS modem program.
 The Apple IIe and Apple IIGS are extremely compatible except
for modem programs; here they are highly incompatible. To use
my own program written in Forth I would have to find the correct
toolkit documentation and rewrite all of my primitive code. I
would rather just buy a reasonably priced program with buffer
saving ability.
 Thanks in advance for any leads.

Msg 41131 is 21 line(s) on 01/09/89 from MIKE COOK
to ALL re: HELP W/ ST4026 HARD DISK

I have an offer I can't refuse for a Seagate ST4026 20 MEG hard
disk. My question is will it work in my system? I have an IBM PC
(with newer ROM to support hard disk drives) with dual full height
floppies. Of course, I'll have to pull one of the floppies. It
has the original 63 watt power supply as well.
My questions are:
1. is the ST4026 "XT" compatible
2. what kind of controller cshould/can I use
 (is there an RLL possible?)
3. will my trusty IBM power supply have to go? Am I better off with
 an external case/power supply?
4. if the answer is "no" it won't work in an IBM PC, is anyone interested
 in buying it and how much will you offer me?
Any information would be greatly appreciated. One more question, is
anyone aware of the existence of a floppy/hard controller (XT compatible)
that will drive 360/720/ and-or 144 MEG floppy drives, that would work
with the ST4026, of course.
Thanks,
Mike Cook

Bob, TIC (talk is Cheap) is a good sharere program. I have a (I believe
version that I's be happy to send. I also like Mousetalk - not GS specific
neither is but should work - and well.
just leave your address.

to ALL re: HAYES COMMAND SET

 Does anyone have a copy of the Hayes command set? I
purchased a Hayes Micromodem IIe used, and it came with no
instructions. I spicificly want to know how to use the
speaker. It is an all internal modem. The newer version of
the Micromodem IIe. The old one had two parts a card and an
external device called an octocupler. Also I could use
 some public domain Tellecomunications programs.

to WARD re: RE-INKING

 Read with fascination your note on refilling DeskJet cartridges,
and wondered if it would apply to ThinkJet cartridges. But even new
in the box, and including the box, my cartridges weigh barely one
ounce. The HP part numbers are 92261A for regular and 51604A for
plain paper.
 How do you refill? Punch out the recessed spherical plastic
nipple next to the electrical contacts? If so, can you reseal
it with glue? This would be a great use for a hypodermic needle,
but non-addicts can no longer get them.
 I love the quiet of the ThinkJet, but it is more expensive than
I would like for volume use. If I can refill the cartridges the
ancient Epson will be relegated to standards-verification duty.

to WARD re: FEYNMAN BOOKS

I ran a search for Feynman books on the DuPage Library System, and
came up with these:
 1. The character of physical law
 Cambridge : M.I.T. Press, c1965
 2. QED : the strange theory of light and matter
 Princeton, N.J. : Princeton University Pr., c1985
 3. "Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman!" : adventures of a curious character
 New York : Norton, c1985
 4. "What do you care what other people think?" : further adventures
 of a curious character
 Richard P. Feynman as told to Ralph Leighton
 New York : Norton, c1988 255 p. : ill. ; 22 cm.
Seven of the member libraries have #4 and two more have ordered it.
Copies in the Streamwood and Glen Ellyn libraries are checked out now.
The book hasn't been on the shelves long enough for good usage stats,
but I'm betting that it will be popular.

Using Qbasic. I can't get the codes accepted in the pgm I am working
on, did in a test run. Must be because I am NOT in the main module.
With 174K, I will just thumb through the books while I work on the
printout routine. Have 150K data file to play with now. The F keys
would make it look nicer but it is complicated enough so a little
more might not hurt! hehe.

Have you noticed how computers do that? I spent about what I expected,
and then another MG of RAM, and a VGA system would be nice, and.

There are a couple of books that are good on this subject. One that
made the best sellers here is "The C programmers guide to serial communication"
it has a description of the UART, and its use in the PC. I don't
have the book handy, but I'll try and dig it out and dig out the relevant
information. I'll also try and get some more details on the book.
