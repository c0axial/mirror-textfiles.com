to LOU ABERNATHY re: THANKS

.for the kind words. Yep, this is the place - first BBS ever.
 Hope you weren't up here a few weeks ago trying to avoid the heat
of N. Carolina - we probably had you beat! I kind of like the rain
lately - the lawns look better, and I really don't like it when it
gets into the 80s or higher!

to VAUNE MONDT re: PRINTING

You asked if you can do a print screen. I don't know. That has nothing
to do with CBBS. If YOUR computer has a printer hooked up to it, if YOUR
computer has a print screen that works, if YOUR communications program
allows print screen, then YOUR computer can do a print-screen.
 Perhaps what you don't realize is that the first line of the ? command
output says something like " ^S to stop ", and perhaps you aren't into
computers enough to realize that ^ means a "control", so ^S means
"Control s". But CBBS is even more friendly than that - it allows
just an S (or s) to be pressed to stop scrolling, and start it again
(sometimes it continues mysteriously, due to line noise that comes in).
 P.S. if you DO get into using CBBS, please (if you can) turn off
your CAPS LOCK - most use CAPS FOR EMPHASIS.

to SCOTT TEIPE re: GOOD NUMBERS

Seriously? Wasn't the list of BBS numbers adequate???
 OK, I'll answer your question. "No, I don't know any 'good
numbers' to call". That's a very "personal" thing. Some people don't
like CBBS because it has no file transfers. Others like it BECAUSE it
has no file transfers, and is therefore not always busy with people not
doing messages, which they prefer. (clearly, I'm one of the latter).
 Look thru the list. It would take megabytes to have reviews of each,
and I doubt anyone would be willing to put in the effort.

You uploaded an unreadable message. Sorry you had problems. But please,
if a message is totally trashed (every line started in the middle of
a word) don't (S)AVE it, but rather (A)bort. Thanks!

I've never cleaned any diskette drives except 8"ers.

Msg 42153 is 08 line(s) on 07/22/89 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to JIM MILLS re: R/386-16

Jim: Thanks for your interest. For the full configuration, I'm asking
2300/obo; for the "stripped" (i.e. without 387, "extra" meg of RAM, or
card/monitor) I'm asking 1600/obo.
Please note that I'm willing to bargain for price and/or trade for
super VGA card/multisync monitor and 80Mb+ SCSI or ESDI hd. I just
want to upgrade to a 'bigger' system for less cost than expansion
of my present system.

Yea, a cleaning kit last for years. I only use it about 2X a year.

 Thanks very much for the info (msg#42133) you provided on vt-100
terminals. It will help me to put in perspective & thus cool my ardor
to buy garbage just because it's cheap. -Art

to BRENT JONES re: R/CLEANING DISK DRIVES

The drive-cleaning kits can do wonders to avoid various error messages.
I've found that using them once every 3-4 months works fine on a floppy-only
system, about once every 6 months on a floppy in a hard-drive system. Just
how often <you> should use them varies according to amount of use, environ-
mental conditions in the room where the computer is located, etc. But
forget the "once per week" or whatever the kits "recommend.".The kits
come in two varieties: wet and dry. I keep both around but <only> use the
wet type unless all else fails. Reason? The dry variety tends to be like
using sandpaper; it uses an abrasion principle which is hard on the
drive heads. But on a few occasions over the years I've found that it did
the job when the wet variety wouldn't.For what it's worth, I've found
prices vary substantially among dealers-worth a little shopping around.

You should have had carrier connect with the settings you used. It sounds
as though there was just too much line noise at the time. But one
possibility is that you were using the more common CCITT 300 bps standard
rather than the Bell 300 bps standard this country strangely insists on
using. I recall that my modems, which accept incoming calls at 300, 1200
or 2400, will only connect with callers using the worldwide (except the
U.S.) CCITT standard for two of the three speeds. (I don't recall which,
but the problem very well might be at 300.)

I enjoyed hearing of your call from Stuttgart, as I lived near there for
a year some time ago and still have friends there (about 30 k north of
there). Viel spass.
