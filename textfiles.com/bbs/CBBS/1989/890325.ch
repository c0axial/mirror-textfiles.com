Msg 41552 is 20 line(s) on 03/23/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to PEGGY GREEN re: WHY NO COCO

Lots of reasons. The main one is that I'd rather run a board that has
topics of high interest to a small set of users, than try to be the
BBS that has a little something for everyone.
 Just as I cursed my radio last week when YET ANOTHER Chicagoland FM
station went to the "best of the old and new" (which I call "mixed
vegetable programming - i.e. yuk!), so would I dislike a board which
catered to everyone one every interest. That's why we don't allow msgs
on "cars for sale", etc - I want to appeal highly to a select group of
users. Those who find it too hard to use, or who don't find topics of
interest to them here are welcome to try elsewhere.
 There are exceptions: CBBS caters to the "advanced hobbyists", and one
time there were some msgs of great interest about a machine no one else
had - some kind of single board machine, that the guy was using to monitor
the environment (temperature, furnace on/off time, etc) at his apartment
building.
 Thanks for stopping by - sorry if its not what you're looking for. By
anther analogy, you don't go to the hardware store for aspirin, nor the
drug store for a hammer. You don't come to CBBS for COCO stuff, PC,
Unix, and other folks wouldn't go to a COCO-friendly board for PC
matters either. Better many specific boards than many generic ones.

Msg 41553 is 14 line(s) on 03/23/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JOHN STEPIEN re: MSGS

If you leave a msg with a # to call, please be VERY specific about what
is being called. The kind of information that is MINIMAL is:
 - hours of operation
 - name of operator
 - type of system being used
 - purpose of the system
 - whether it is open and free, registration only, limited free access,
 - etc
In other words, msgs that just say "call this number" get deleted. Also
I don't understand why you left TWO messages when one would do (if it
contained the right info).
 Sorry you had problems the first time - looking forward to more details
about the system. Please ensure any system is relevant to CBBS' goals:
PC's, Unix, programming, communications, ham radio, etc.

Msg 41554 is 08 line(s) on 03/24/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to MICHAEL SZEWCZYK re: R/XMODEM CRC

What specifically is your BASIC's syntax for a bitwise left shift? Come
to think of it, you MIGHT be able to implement that with a multiplication
by two, though it might be slow unless your compiler replaces multiplication
by a power of two with a shift. Also, what is your syntax for bitwise AND
and bitwise XOR (be careful about the AND; it has to be "bitwise" rather than
"logical." Assuming that the operator is called "AND," try evaluating
(3 AND 2). If the result is 2, it's bitwise; if the result is 1 or -1, it's
logical and won't help here).

Msg 41555 is 06 line(s) on 03/24/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/IBMAUX1?

Unless IBMAUX1 does more than I think it does, I still don't see why
you need to use it. As far as I know, all it does is filter out control-c
but otherwise acts just like COM1. The only drawback would be that
someone who got through the first two levels of security could possibly
abort the batch file if he hit control-c right before your invocation
of COMMAND.

Msg 41558 is 30 line(s) on 03/24/89 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to ALL re: BOARD LEVEL REPAIR.!

I just had a triumphant experience, so I wanted to let folks know.
 Last week I got a call from an organization I do computer work
for, to the effect that one of their 'original' IBM-PCs was flakey.
It tended to crash while running Word Perfect and XyWrite and other
things. It also was generating PARITY CHECK 2 messages and, as
previously noted here, claiming that COMMAND.COM was invalid when it
tried to reload. So I downloaded NMI.COM from the ADVOCATE and
tested memory. No problems showed up. So I decided it was an
intermittant problem and installed NMI (as spec'd in NMI.DOC) in place
of the usually NMI error handler and left it to them. Tuesday, it
failed again, and NMI found the error in the parity bit of BANK 0. I
went in with visions of replacing the BANK 0 parity chip and being out
in half an hour, but I was WRONG. IBM machines of this vintage had
BANK 0 (and ONLY BANK 0) soldered in place.
 So I went to Radio Shack for a Solder Sucker and 16-pin DIP
socket, and to INACOMP, who were willing to sell me just 2 64KBIT
chips (@ $3.50, but what the heck) and set to work. It only took an
hour or so to remove the dead parity chip and put a socket in its
place, and then plug in the new chip (I bought 2 just in case one was
bad.). It worked, first time out. No crash. Even the Person Whom
Computers Hate (PWCH), who is the main user of this beast, had no luck
crashing it. So.
 This suggests that most repairs are in fact doable by
individuals. It also suggests the worth of having a good set of
diagnostic tools around. NMI.COM is one - alas, it works only on
PCs, not ATs or beyond - but you get the idea. The standard practice
in this case would have been motherboard replacement, at c. $500 -
they'd done it before. Repair was MUCH cheaper for the organization.
It would have been even more important if it had been my own machine
that failed, since $700 is something I ain't got.

Msg 41559 is 14 line(s) on 03/24/89 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to ALEX ZELL re: STUFF

Yes, it was me that saved whatever remained of the original CBBS
from the clutches of Randy's ashcan. He was going to dump whatever
he couldn't sell, if I remember rightly. Randy told me at that
time that he had the monitor, but that it was in use-holding up
one side of the hot-water tank in the basement. For all I know,
it's still there. He also said he loaned out the original modem
card, and could get it back. (Mike Andrews tells me that Roger
Hale was the guy he loaned it to, and Roger would be happy to
have it reunited with the rest of the hardware.) Randy also
said he had some other equipment on th shelfs above the rafters
in his garage, but he didn't feel like getting it down. (I
think they were disk drives or a power supply.)
 I guess now we know why the monitor wasn't in use on CBBS for
a few years!

Msg 41561 is 08 line(s) on 03/25/89 from JAMES SCHMIDT
to ALL re: SMG MODEMS

I received the new ELEK-TEK catalog and noticed a new brand of modem
being advertized "SMG" (Smart Money Group). The picture of the 2400
external bears a striking similarity the the PP2400SA as a matter of
fact its model number is also 2400SA. Are there PP clones or real PP
modems under a private label. The price defferential is significant
129 dollars for the SMG versus 179 dollars for the PP. The SMG carries
only a 2 year warranty while the PP has a 5 year guarantee.
