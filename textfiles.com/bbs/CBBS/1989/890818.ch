Msg 42299 is 30 line(s) on 08/14/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to BRENT JONES re: R/MESSAGE NUMBERS

Heh heh - I got REAL beat up when I used to re-start the msg #'s. But
actually, I very seldom type a msg #.
 For example, the command o;* will give you one line summaries from your
previous call. Or, OR;* will do one-line summaries with AUTO retrieve.
 OR, what I recommend, is doing r;* which will retrieve the first msg
left since your previous call (possibly including any you left at that time)
and then you can ^C once into the text if you don't want to see 'em, then
use "." to retrieve the next msg # when asked "Msg #:", or use "," to
retrieve the previous msg #.
 Yet another way to avoid msg #'s is to use relative msg #'s - relative
to the current "high" msg #. For example, r;-1 will retrieve the most
recently entered msg. You could then enter "," to retrieve the previous
one, etc. If you see one you want to reply to, you can RE to it when asked
for a msg #.
 These are all very kludgy and inconsistent, but there is quite a bit of
"power there". Also, when asked for a msg # AFTER the first, you need only
enter the digits that CHANGE, so you might just o;*, then R the correct
msg # (typing the entire thing in once) then lets say it si 42302, you
could then retrieve 43808 by just typing an 8, since that is the only
trailing digit that changed.
 As if all this weren't enough, the "OR" (one line summary with retrieve)
or QR (quick) or SR (longer summary) will "remember" the first 9 msg #'s
found in "variables" called #1 thru #9, so you could, if you call
frequently, do an or;* to start auto-retrieve since you last call, then ^K
out of it, after it starts showing the first msg contents, then, looking
at the 1-line summaries, do r;#8 for example to get the 8th of the new
msgs.
 Heh heh. You can see why I say I seldom enter msg #'s. Matter of fact,
I sometimes "guess" i.e. r;-7 and if I'm off a bit, use , or ., or if I'm
way off, I try again i.e. r;-12 etc. I don't like typin' 'em either! I don't!

Msg 42300 is 08 line(s) on 08/15/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: EXTENDED MEMORY

You might look into programs like QEMM or 386-To-The-Max which will let
you remap extended memory (which most programs can't address) as expanded
memory (which some can). They also have ways of putting drivers and the
like in extended memory. Both programs run about $50.
BTW, how much memory do you have in your machine?
P.S. Your earlier message indicated a bit of confusion. There's NO
motherboard memory in the range between 640K and 1MEG. That space is
occupied by BIOS ROMS, video memory and that sort of thing.

Msg 42301 is 18 line(s) on 08/15/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/EXTENDED MEMORY

 1) I have 2 meg. 2) Those pgms look interesting, will look into them.
 3) I was confused. I played around for a few hours, read the
DOS manula a little and checked with a util pgm that came with the
computer. I have two config.sys files (to alternate with). One gives
me the full RAM 1 meg and the other gives me the full 1 meg as
expanded mem which I use for another run.
 It tok a little bit of practice with the config.sys file and
placing the RIGHT driver "first". I can also mess up the system
and make expanded memory out of the 640K to 1 meg RAM on board.
With this new video I have to see what it does and how it uses mem.
The rest shouldbe similiar but loading a 800 X 600 video driver
takes up some regular memory! Wish it worked for MS WORD which I use.
Oh well, didn't upgrade to V5 anyway!
 Finally tested the LQ printer. The fun begins now playing around
with all the different fonts I can use and hopefully merge. Realize
I should have gone to more than 80 meg HD but by time I NEED more
I should KNOW how I want to install more HS space.
 Having a ball with this (until I get practical).

I low level formated a disk but I forgot the process. I think I
used debug, then FDISK, and then the high level format. I will
be getting a 65mB hard drive (Mitsubishi 535) which I have to
do the whole thing-low level, configure, then high level format.
But I forgot how to do it. I did in on a 32 megger but I forgot
the process-is ther a simple book? Thanks.

 You are right, Ward, the software here is plenty elegant and powerful
I guess that I am guilt of not reading all the instrucions on all the
various BBS that I have been looking at.
 Do you log onto any particular BBS of note? I am looking for the a
pie in the sky-"The World's Easiest to Use for Novices BBS Software". The
reason for this is I want to establish an inter-agency board for some
folks who don't currently know about BBS and could REALLY make good use
of them. They would be so intimidated by every BBS I have seen thus far,
that I don't think they would give it a fair shake.

Actually, the Commodore 128 should be fairly immune to virus problems due
to the fact that 1) in most cases it's a floppy-only system and 2) the
operating system is contained in ROM. 1) means there's no hard disk to
trash and 2) means that a nasty prograwMm"Dq|7
can't attach itself to the operating system and spread itself. I haven't been
much involved with Commodore systems for the last few years, so I'm not sure
what the current thinking is, other than to say that if it looks too good
to be true, it probably is, i.e. the most likely method of distributing
"nastyware" would be in the form of pirated commercial programs.

Well I called up the company that makes the computer and installed
the Adap2372B controller and they said this controller would
indeed do a low level format on a larger (65mB) drive. I still
have forgotten the g:0800 sequence that starts the debug program
though.it is G:0800 something or other.

well, i found out that i had a lot to learn about configuring
hardware properly, even though i'm far from computer illiterate!
finally got the beast running today w/ an ESDI drive/ctrlr, after
trying almost every conceivable set of jumpoer settings on board
and drive, and every conceivable combination of video, ctrlr, etc.
cards. btw, turns out this is not a 'true' Step - doesn't use
everex's proprietary ram caching, but instead probably uses
cascaded intel cache controllers. I can up it to 256K if i want,
but i don't see any reason. i'll keep passing the good word on
spear.

Yes! The system is finally up and running, after I took a day off
work to continue pursuing my goal! I gave up on the SCSI drive
and opted for an ESDI (btw, PC PROS out in Darien had a special
on Miniscribe ESDI drive mdl 3130E (110 Mb, 17ms access) for $649!
it's "while they last", but what a sweet deal-you might find it
worthwile. Their # is 810-1010, and they seem to be a good bunch.
I'm glad to hear your new system is running well-with the interior
room, I can see how it would be a good component tester!
Well, all's well that ends well. Talk to you later.

Today I stopped in my local Sears store and purchased a $39.99
PRODIGY information service kit. Prodigy is the new information
service that is a joint effort between IBM and Sears. Well, this is
a warning to any fellow impulse buyers out there. Prodigy does not have
a local 312 number for dial up yet! If you buy it and open the password
you may not be able to return it. The closest number is in the state of
Michigan. They are scheduled to have a Chicago number in two to three
weeks. Just thought that I'd let you know.

If you would do me a favor and let me know how you like Prodigy, I would
really appreciate it. Either leave a note here or call me directly
 at 312/665-4462 Brent Jones For only $9.95 per MONTH Prodigy has
great potential-hope it is as useful as CompuServe.

A computer store in ST. Louis is selling laptops for $325.00. The name
of the store is called "ConnectingPoint" and their number is (314)
231-1994 and talk to Stan. Tell him that Bill Wolff sent you. The other
Bill Kuy. on CFOG mentioned to me that Sharp had trouble with these
laptops. I didn't know that when I bought mine. So far it works great and
has a year warranty with it. I bought it with my American Express card,
so that is really two years right? But since I bought it I ordered another
drive and chips tke it 640K. It comes with 256K and one drive.

I work with the C128 a lot and I know of no Commodore 64 or 128
anti-virus program. On top of that, I know of no virus problems on
either computer. GEOS and CP/M are disk based operating systems
though, and can have problems with viruses that could written to your
boot disk. But I have yet heard of any problems with them either. The
only Commodore computers that has known viruses are the Amiga and the
MS-DOS line of computers. For now though, the C64 and the C128 are
safe. Enjoy!
