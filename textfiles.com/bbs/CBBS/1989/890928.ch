to BILL WOLFF re: R/GEOS AND LASERWRITER!

Postscript is a stack based graphical forth-like language. For Apple
Macs a print driver (Laserwriter) uses the quickdraw bottlenecks to
translate quickdraw commands to Postscript, prepends a Apple specific
Postscript dictionary, and sends the whole datastream to the Laserwriter
via AppleTalk.

I've heard that a company called Pacific (something - dont remember the
whole name - they make the 25-in-1 cartridge) features a postscript
cartridge that you can plug into a laserjet.

BTW, does that software expect to communicate via Appletalk or the
Laserwriter's RS232 port? If it uses the RS232, I believe it operates in
a Diablo emulation mode (though it may still somehow escape to postscript).

I am looking for 2 good 1200 baud modems for the Commodore 64 and Vic-20.
If you have what I need, and we can agree on a price, I'd appreciate mail
here, or at the EIES BBS (312) 890-8512, as Mr. Nobody. I intend to give
these as gifts to some of the steadfast users of EIES, to allow them to
enjoy more of the benefits of this new board. That means that I'd like
the modems to be in good condition, but can't afford to pay top dollar.
Let's make a deal,
 Dennis Tokoph AKA: Mr. Nobody
