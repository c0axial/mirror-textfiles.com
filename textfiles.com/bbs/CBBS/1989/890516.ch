to BILL WOLFF re: R/IEEE-484

The difference between a Centronics printer port and an IEEE-488 port
is more than just the number of pins. I'd suggest you call the Advocate
(see previous message from Jerry Olsen) and leave a question there,
since I remember that there are a couple of Exec users there.

Also, I have a Kaypro 10 (the hard-disk machine) that I might consider
selling. If your friend is interested, have him give me a call at
251-5787. Mind you, I'm still not certain whether I want to sell it.

Msg 41825 is 05 line(s) on 05/16/89 from KEVIN KEYSER
to BILL WOLFF re: R/NEED COMPUTER

If your friend is interested the Commodore C-128D runs the latest version of
CP/M and it can use Kaypro II disks and programs.
In addition to this it has 2 other operating systems (C-64 and
C-128 native.) You can pick it up for around $450.00 (Without monitor)
