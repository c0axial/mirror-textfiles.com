The Computer Shopper advertising magazine maintains quite a large list
of bulletin boards across the country. Should be able to find something
in there. I find 'em in the larger book stores (actually not all that
large - but part of a large (Krochs) set of stores in Chicago).
 I buy one about every 3 months for the ads, look at it for a while,
then toss it.

Has anybody ever used MICROSOFT's BASIC compiler for CP/M? I am
using a OSBORNE version from Public Domain Copying Software from
N.Y. The few sheets they give you states to use BASCOM Filename
and that creates a REL file and then use LINK80 to create a COM
file. Fine but BASCOM locks up. It also states if you use BASCOM
without a fi}name, you get a "*" prompt like PIP does? But I get
a lockup again. To me it sounds like this BASCOM is a bad COM file!
Any ideas?

to BILL WOLFF re: R/MBASIC

Your facts sound a bit strange. I'd think Microsoft wouldn't have released
MBASIC to the public domain. So it's a little unclear that you really have
a copy of the "real" MBASIC. But presuming it is and that it's PD, yes, it
sounds as though you got a bum copy.or there's something unusual about
your computer. E.g., do you have a full CP/M 64K of TPA? If not, it well
might be that MBASIC is simply overwriting part of your operating system in
high memory and, hence, the lock-up. I'd suggest testing the program on a
friend's computer to see if it's the program or the computer. Good luck.

I'm not stealing the command line arguments from low memory; rather, I'm
letting the compiler do the dirty work and simply utilizing argc and argv.
I suspect that somewhere I'm incrementing a counter once too often,
resulting in my program having the chance to pull in some garbage. If the
.COM version isn't initializing data holding areas the same as the .EXE
version, that would explain it. In any event, I've worked around the problem.
I had a statement in there that tested the first value of an argv char
array, and I simply expanded it to include <all chars. That, plus a fix
to a related statement, has resulted in clean results. The new BATCH
command processor is now up on The Advocate for beta testing, and is about
as done as I plan to make it for awhile. Meets all my needs, at least (grin).

Your C listings would come in handy when I get around to some revisions to my
shell which are on the back burner while we "finish" the BBS package. So, as
getting things off by mail is one of those things I <am> reasonably prompt
about here's what I'd suggest to you/Marty (CBBS wouldn't accept both names on
the command line).How 'bout putting the code up on The Advocate and,
if Marty will pass along his address, if it's just 2K I'll gladly list
and mail the info.

Marty: If this sounds workable to you, you might want to leave your address
over on The Advocate. I do get over here to CBBS often enough, I suppose,
but as The Advocate's computers are in my home.

to BILL WOLFF re: R/CP/M BASIC COMPILER

The Osborne version of BASCOM is machine-specific. It'll only run on an
Osborne 1. Won't even run on an Osborne Executive. I guess they did that as
a form of copy protection - maybe that was te deal between Osborne and
Microsoft.

You might try calling MicroSoft to see if they hav a generic copy that they'd
trade you for. Or maybe even sell. Let me know if you have any luck.

If you compile the code on an O-1 you can run it anywhere, so maybe you can
get an Osborne 1 (currently about $150) to compile on.

Thanks Mike; I had a feeling that was the case. I have two versions of
SuperCalc 1.05 and 1.12 and the 1.05 works great on a Commodore, but 1.12
doesn't. The screen clears and nothing. I did type the commands blindly and
it did exit. So it didn't lock up, it just didn't type it to the screen. I
have an Osborne Executive and both copies runs fine.

How about Disk Doctor? I can't seem to get it to run on the Commodore r
the Osborne Executive. To install it askes for starting sector number
1 or 0, sectors per track and how many tracks. I tried 0,10,40; 0,5,40;
1,5,40; and 1,10,40. It just doesn't work! Is this the same thing? Only
works on a Osborne 1?

I also have milestone, havn't tried running it on Commodore or Osborne
Executive. Hope the same isn't true, as I do plan on running them on
those computers, thanks!

No, I am not talking about Microsoft Basic called MBASIC. But I am
talking about Microsoft's Compiler for MBASIC. It is called
BASCOM.COM. And no, neither MBASIC or BASCOM is in Public Domain. But
there is a company called "Public Domain Software Copying Company"
(PDSC) yes everyone thinks it's all public domain stuff if you mention
their name. Which alot of it is! But the truth is they bought out
OSBORNE's software when they went out of business. This means you can
buy WordStar, SuperCalc, MBASIC, CBASIC, etc for about $40.00 each.

Yes, I have tried it on a Commodore 128 in CP/M mode, OSBORNE
Executive (both have 128K installed) and a Kaypro II (64K) and all the
same thing. Now PDSC didn't send the manual for the Compiler, but just
a few type written pages (foggy I might add) how to use it. So either
it's a bum copy or I don't know how to use it right!

But Mike Andrews hit the nail on the head, I think. He said it only works
on Osborne 1's. Too bad, 40 bucks down the drain. Unless I get a deal on
a Osborne 1. $150.00 is more than it is worth to me. Does anyone want to
buy BASCOM for $40.00?

to ALL re: CBBS 9600!

 When CBBS signs on, if it says version 4.0.2a, that means we are running
the interrupt driven 9600 baud code! The U.S. Robotics Courier HST will
do ARQ (MNP) at 1200, 2400, and 9600 (possibly also 4800, but "why"?).
 I still have a BIG bug in that my routine to run things under DOS
directly doesn't work, but since CBBS itself seems to be working OK,
I'm going to leave things as they are.
 Please give me feedback on any problems or just leave comments, etc.
 Thanks! (especially to USR for such a great modem!)
 P.S. the interrupt driven code is an old routine "RS232.ASM":
