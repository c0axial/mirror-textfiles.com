to ROGER HALE re: R/ORIGINAL CBBS STUFF

Gee, thanks - it would be nice to have as many of the "pieces" as
possible. One thing scares me though: they probably want the whole
SYSTEM to RUN! Eaaaargh!

to BILL COLEMAN re: CBBS LOGON DELAYS

I have noticed those long delays, too - though not 15 seconds. I think
it is the modem attempting to establish an MNP connection, but failing
that it then finally takes off.
 Sorry if you or others have to slightly modify the logon scripts
to accommodate these delays. My script basically says:
 while not matching pattern "CBBS" send CR every second
and that seems to work no matter what. OH, I have a secondary pattern
match on "Welcome" since - for reasons unknown - the CBBS part seems
to be skipped every now and then.
 P.S. Thanks for the kind words about CBBS.

Thanks, I deleted that reference. Strange that what was a BBS a year
ago should be given to another person! But I guess when someone moves
they don't say "don't re-use this #, it has been published as a BBS".

What's the deal here Tom? You peddle yourself to some company as
a software jock and then go out begging for people to help you
out with your assignments cuz you can't handle 'em? This kind of stuff
is the reason the software profession is in the state it's in. Guys like
you give qualified programmers, who've spent years learning their trade,
a bad name. If you want code designed, hire a someone who knows what
they're doing.

 Actually, I briefly got to know the person who ran the board, and he
was running the board on his home phone number; it was a part-time board
in that respect. I believe he had some hard disk problems at one point
which made him temporarily stop running the board, and then temporary
turned to permanent for one reason or another.
 This is a reminder that I haven't talked to him in a while; if I
find out anything interesting when and if I get in touch with Joe, I'll
pass it along.

to WARD re: UDS 4800

saw u mentioned something to Mike about a customer going with UDS 4800
modems which might be SYNC not ASYNC types if the numbers were 208A/B.

if they wanted SYNC modems for 3780, 3270, etc. I don't think that the
HST will perform as a SYNC modem.

to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/XMODEM CRC

 Eric, Thanks a lot for your help. I beleive I understand what the
routine is doing now. Thanks A Lot.

 I understand what the number 256 and 32768 correspond to. But what is
the significance of the number 4129?

 Just Curious. thanks a lot, really. I appreciate everything.

 on, the beta version (Less the file sections) is running at 438-9356>

 During the day, I get connected but before even any signals are passed
I get disconnected. The late evening is no problem. Had this trouble
noticeably since I changed to 2400 here a week or so ago.
