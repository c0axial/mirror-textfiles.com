to JERRY OLSEN re: BBS LIST

You might consider becoming a Chinet member - $50/yr gives you access to
the "wide world" of the Unix network, etc. Also you could pick up the
BBS lists that Alex downloads from Stillwaters and uploads there.

Msg 42599 is 12 line(s) on 10/10/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to GUS ROUMAYA re: YOUR COMMENT

Ah, welcome to your first communications system! Most systems use the
standard ASCII character "control-S" which means "X-off" which stops the
system from sending to you.
 Unfortunately, until we get our 9600 baud modem back, the one we have is
quite noisy and the system may see the line noise and start sending to you
again. But try pressing ^S (or just "S") while CBBS is typing to you and
it should stop.
 Then use the "E" command to enter a msg, and use "ALL" as who to,
and "Victor 9000" as the subject (or "Victor 9000 commo" if that's what
you want - saying "communications" might make the subject too long).
 Welcome to BBSing. Don't judge all BBSs by this one - it was the first,
and is "historical" - meaning "quite crude".

You've done what I would recommend - just go GET a 360K for your AT-class
machine. There's no other shortcut that will "cut" it. !8^)

Thanks, I'll go to Plantz and get that. Just last night I spent a half
hour in DEBUG trying to find that keyboard buffer thing. I know I'd
found it earlier in Periscope, but couldn't find it this time.

Msg 42606 is 07 line(s) on 10/11/89 from ED FOSTER
to ALL re: EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY

 A small software firm specializing in office automation for
the food industry has an opening for a full-time programmer in
product development. Programs are currently in Turbo Pascal, so
proficiency with that language is necessary. Office is in St.
Charles, IL (far West suburbs). Some travel is required.
 I will be doing the initial screening but will not make the
final selection. Call me at 312-584-2989 if you are interested.

Msg 42607 is 10 line(s) on 10/11/89 from PETE CANTELE
to ALL re: FILTER NEEDED

Could someone please help me? I'm looking for a routine to add a
'return', x'0D', following every form feed (hex'0C').
It seems best to tap into the dos interrupt for the printer, but I
packed all my books away for a move and I just don't know how to do
this.
Any help would be appreciated.
p.s. I need to do something like this because we have a large com-
piled dBase program that our folks out west won
't change for us and the carraige is left out in the middle after
every form feed.

to JIM POLOUS re: R/FOR SALE

Will that controller support two different types of drives (brands)?
I have a ST 4096 and don't need another full 80 meg.

Msg 42610 is 14 line(s) on 10/11/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/360K PROBLEM

 I got the 360K drive and second controller today. Had a problem but got
it running.
 The 360K is hooked up to the main controller and I have the 1.4 meg
to the second controller. Maybe should change it!
 1) Had to put DRIVER.SYS in the directory, didn't have it!
 2) Had to put the "NODMA" ctatement in the driver. Would you
believe that a Micronics motherboard has an incompatible DMA and I
had to bypass it for this driver.
 3) Set the drive up as a 1.4 and can't read a 720K unless I change
the config.sys statement for my driver.
 Maybe I will hook the 360K up to the second controller so the
computer can read 1.4 and 720K. Maybe won't have to use the NODMA
statement also. These drivers etc are a pain getting in the right order.
 BUT. I have 3 floppy drives running on the 386 now.

to ALL re: TYPEWRITER

 Anyone have a cheap (good) typewriter for sale? I need one to leave
address labels in. Fed up with changing the printer from paper to labels.
 Maybe trade?

-Prodigy. They must be getting scared. They sent me an offer for a $170
Hayes modem and 3 months free service. I got this BBS # from it.

Msg 42613 is 08 line(s) on 10/12/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to PETE CANTELE re: R/FILTER NEEDED

Sounds like you need to hook into the BIOS printer interrupt (many programs
bypass the DOS printer function, which in any case calls the BIOS interrupt).
What kind of printer are you using that doesn't automatically return the
carriage on a form feed, anyway?
In any case, I can write the filter for you, though I'm not in a position to
do it for free (we're probably talking $25 or so). If interested, give
me a call at 251-5787 (Wilmette); leave a message on the answering machine
if I'm out.

Msg 42614 is 03 line(s) on 10/12/89 from JIM POLOUS
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/FOR SALE

I don't see why not. Which controller were y{u looking for?
the XT or the AT? and Which drives did you want to connect to it?

port to work properly?

]Heh, heh, I doubt Jerry will want to become a contrib on chinet.
He runs a small typesetting business on what I believe is a pretty
tight budget under fairly high overhead in his apartment in South Loop.
The board also contains a section for "Nowar" activities -- a
group for counseling military personell -- including conscientous
objectors. (Thus the name "Advocate" for his BBS.   There are some
hot political and other current even discussions there.
Eric Bohlman and others have done some fine CP/M development work
on the board.
