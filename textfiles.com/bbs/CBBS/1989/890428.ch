to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/REPLACEMENT MOTHERS?

An 8-slotter will fit IN the case, but the "5 openings" won't line up
with the "8-slots", so actually, no, it won't fit. You'd be better off
to spring for a case, then, too.
 What I did was go for a Bullet 286 8mhz, 0-wait state 5 slotter -
minimal investment. I got mine from DP Computers in Salt Lake, though
there may be cheaper places. It was $300 with 0-K. Best to populate it
with 1M of 120ns chips. It has nice BIOS based disk cacheing, including
a unix-like 1-sec delayed write cacheing - you should see this sucker
de-arc a file! Wow!
 Drawbacks are that you've not expanded your slots, and you can't back
fill the motherboard for EMS, and I think the 384K cache won't work
with EMS - because it maps the ENTIRE 384K into the 640-1024K area,
and banks out your video and other ROMS when it does the cache transfers.
 But it met my needs, is very nicely fast, was a rather easy install,
and was the kind of "minimal investment" so I can build up my bank account
for a "REAL" machine some day.

to ALL re: HARD DISK INTERFACING

I posted a question on this topic a while back, but I may not have
made it clear what I was asking about:
I need to learn about the low-level details of hard disk interfacing.
In other words, what kinds of busses are available on controller cards.
What are the commands that the controller can execute. That kind of
thing. I want to learn this because I may be working on a project
in which a hard drive is used as a component of a dedicated piece of
hardware (which will not resemble an IBM clone in any way).
Are there any good reference books on this subject? What manufacturer's
literature should I look for?

Msg 41736 is 11 line(s) on 04/28/89 from JERRY OLSEN
to BOB SULLIVAN re: R/DISK LIFE

Several years ago, I read in a pub which otherwise provided excellent
advice that integrity was virtually 100% reliable for 6 months, with
an increasing deterioration thereafter. My own experience suggests
the once/year idea proposed by others here is quite safe. I still regularly
dig out a disk or three from 1985 and have yet to observe any problems
attributable to time.Part of the issue, of course, is the condition
of the disk when written. So, in addition <copying> each year, I'd also
suggest <reformatting>.Probably of more concern are variations in
hardware. Ideally, reformat/recopy when drives are in known, good alignment.
The biggest problem I've had and seen is trying to read a disk which
was created when drives were borderline good and later read after realignment.

I am selling a CGA full length card. Since it is still in great condition
, I still think it is worth $39.00 /OBO. Please call Adam Dada at:
 698-3091, or Scott Teipe at 692-2005
Since I am buying a VGA card, I REALLY need to sell this one, that is why
I am negotiable. PLEASE!
