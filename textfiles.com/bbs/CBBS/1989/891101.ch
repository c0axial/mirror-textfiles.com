Msg 42698 is 11 line(s) on 10/30/89 from JERRY OLSEN
to ALL re: AZTEC C

A program has recently been released for CP/M (remember it?!) which
performs various functions on DOS .LZH archives. The author distributed
source and washed his hands of it before one major feature (recognition
of CP/M "user areas") was added. I've rewritten it to add this feature,
but need someone kind enough to compile it with AZTEC C. This change
would make the program a real asset to BBSes still running under various
versions of CP/M (many still are). I can't offer to rewrite the balance
of the code to run under my CP/M C compiler, so if you can offer to do
the recompilation, pls either leave a msg here, on the BBS I run
(The Advocate/NOWAR, 312.939.4411, 24 hrs., 8/n/1, central Chicago), or
call me voice (312.939.3300, workdays). Thanx.

Msg 42699 is 10 line(s) on 10/30/89 from BILL WOLFF
to ALL re: HAYES COMMANDS?

Can anybody help me with the Hayes modems? I bought a 1200 and a 2400 baud
without manuals. The 1200 commands I think I know what they are. But I only
figured out half the dip switches are for, help! Also how do you adjust the
sound on the speaker?

Also the 2400 baud Hayes doesn't use dip switches. I also understand it can
store 4 phone numbers. But I don't know how? Plus the "&" commands report
okay on the following: B,C,D,F,G,J,L,M,P,R,S,T,W,Y, and Z. But what do they
mean? The standard AT commands I know are A,C,D,E,F,H,I,O,P,Q,R,S,T,V, and
Z. Are there any others? Like B and L?

Msg 42700 is 10 line(s) on 10/30/89 from MARTY DIPPEL
to BILL WOLFF re: R/HAYES COMMANDS?

My Practical Peripherals 2400 baud modem claims to be Hayes-compatible;
Numbers can be stored by AT&Zn=number where 0 <= n <= 3. To dial
numbers so stored, ATDS=n. To alter the speaker, use the L command:
ATL0 (or ATL or ATL1) sets lowest volume. ATL2 and ATL3 set higher levels
although it doesn't make much difference on mine. ATM0 disables speaker
completely, ATM1 disables only when receiving carrier from a remote
station, ATM2 turns the speaker on at all times, and ATM3 disables while
dialing as well as while receiving remote carrier. ATB0 sets the modem to
CCITT mode while in 1200 baud; ATB1 sets Bell 212A while in 1200 baud
(default). The 'B' command selects 1200 baud operation in all cases.

Msg 42701 is 09 line(s) on 10/30/89 from BILL WOLFF
to MARTY DIPPEL re: R/HAYES COMMANDS?

Thanks a lot! I have two other 1200 baud modems BSR and MIGENT which
are suppose to be HAYES compatible. So I have been trying to piece
together the whole command set.

What doesn't help is that the BSR adds an "*" set too. And the MIGENT
doesn't have a speaker and adds a battery warning command set.

Your input really helped. But I still need to know what the dips are
for on the 1200 baud Hayes and the "&" command set. Thanks! <BW>

Msg 42702 is 03 line(s) on 10/31/89 from MARTY DIPPEL
to BILL WOLFF re: R/HAYES COMMANDS?

Glad I could help. Sorry I don't know about either the dips or the
MIGENT commmands, though doubtless there are others here who do.
Good luck; I'm sure someone here will come through for you!

Can't be done. The commo controllers aren't flexible enough to allow
the following characteristics:
 8-bit ascii transparency
 -and-
 fixed-length blocks with NO particular terminating char
 -and-
 timing out when insufficient chars are received.
 NCP could perhaps be patched to allow the 8-bit transparency, but
you'd have to write a highly interactive program to "suck in the buffer"
many times per second, in order to get around the fact that the commo
controllers don't handle the fixed-length blocks.
 What WOULD be practical, would be to write a 100% PC based system,
that answers the phone, accepts uploads, then using an application
programming interface (such as into IBM's Entry Emulation), using the
host IND$FILE, send the file up to the host.
 The problem would be that you'd need a dedicated PC to support the
transfers. You could also be more sophisticated, and allow the dial-in
user to access the host, using the PC like a "protocol converter",
i.e. where you look at keystrokes from the PC, and pass them in an
appropriate manner to the API to the host, and send screens back from
the host to the PC - but this is a LOT of work. Might be a popular
product, though!

calvin,
 I am in Chicago, on Michigan Avenue. Area Code 708 does not work
yet. I understand it did about 2 weeks ago. It was just a test.
We made the mistake of reconfiguring our dial-back box to use 708
when calling the suburbs - and it worked - for about a week.
now it doesnt. IBT says wait 'till the scheduled date.

Thanks a lot for your input, I have received info of the dips and some
"&" command set. So for the most part, I should have everything I need.
But if someone knows some helpful info the manual has that us with
Hayes compatible intelligence would not know, please share it.
Thanks! <BW>

Also I do have the MIGENT and it's manual. The reason I question it is
because althought it is Hayes compaible, it lacks a speaker, only stores
one number, and powers itself down when the RS-232 floats. I first
bought it for my Epson PX-8, but it powers down (the modem) when I entered
my download or upload menu! Real bad news! The modem would just hang-up!
No problems on other computer although! Just the PX-8 is comserving
power I think! It does a good job too. Runs 20 hours on a charge. Not
handy with "The Pocket Modem" though!

Well I kOjust got the Prodigy package and set up the system. But it
like a giant gab fest or news show. I don't see tt of
pay10.00 a month to hear news you could get one TV. Is Prodigy
good for anything else? Are there any special interest groups
having reasonably informed people? Thanks Richard Hinton.
