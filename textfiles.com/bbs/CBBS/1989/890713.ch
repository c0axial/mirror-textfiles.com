 o;* gives summary of msgs since your last call

to BILL WOLFF re: R/<$50 PC SPEECH SYNTH

Not sure I answered this (months ago?) but I, too, found that dedicating
a machine to being an answering machine was not appropriate. When my hard
drive started to "whine" being on with little air conditioning during
the day, I decided a "dedicated" answering machine would be best. Bought
a Phone Mate, and am I SORRY! You have to buy these weird expensive
"camera" batteries, or it will NOT LET YOU GET YOUR MSGS that happened
before a power outage! Ya, they store the count of rcd msgs in RAM,
and its "adios" when the power goes. I called home several times one day
giving myself reminders (amount of direct deposit check to write in my
checkbook, etc) and when I got home, there was ONLY ONE message, from my
brother, recorded "2 AM, Sunday", meaning 2 hrs after the power got lost
and ate my msgs. Really a piece of high tech junk. I can think of about
5 things I would change on it. Owell, always easier to be a consumer
than an engineer. ;-)

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/W. SUBURBS USER GROUP?

Ward, Thanks for the info. Can you suggest a good text on setting up a simpl
simple message board type bbs like this one? Should I ask in the CIS
forum called "IBMCOMM"? Have you heard of the ECHO Net? Any local board?
The CACHE BBS is very heavily used-games? I can't seem to find it
un-BUSY. One last question how does this bbs know that I am using ProComm
when I log on? Brent Jones

Msg 42075 is 10 line(s) on 07/11/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to ALL re: OVERLOAD?

My power supply switch is shot and I have to get a new one.
I want to add another 40 meg 3 1/2" miniscribe HD and wonder
if the 150 watt will do or do I have to go to a 200 watt (which
will heat up more in the summer).
 I have a video board (ATI), HD and floppy controlled, full length
expanded mem board with 512K, short multi I/O board. Am taking
out the COPYIIPC board and maybe the game port. Have 2 360K
floppies and one 40 meg HD now.
 This is an XT clone (turbo) and I still want to wait to upgrade to a new
computer so have to add to this one.

hello my name is michael pastorelli i was wondering since you guys have
been around so long if you knew of bbs programs that can run on a 2 floppy
system because i have wildcat but i need a harddrive to run it properly
and i know that bbs's have been around allot longer than hard drives so
there must be programs for 2 floppies , and i was wondering if you knew
what they are called and if possible where i could get one from.
or if i have to spill out more cash to up grade this thing?
 thank you

Based upon your comments of affection for your HP Desk Jet, I just bought
one yesterday, a "Plus". It sure is nice. I have used NEC P6 and Toshiba
321 and almost ordered a NEC 5200. I'm much happier with the DJ+. I
tried out all the others first. Is yours a "Plus"?
What font cards would you recommend? Is the HP forum on CIS a good one?
One last question-what kind of work do you do? Didn't you write a
comm program? Thanks Brent Jones
