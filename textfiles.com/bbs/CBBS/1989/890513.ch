Msg 41804 is 10 line(s) on 05/09/89 from SAM LEE
to ALL re: WRITING TO EGA/VGA SCREEN

I really just have one basic question about writing directly to screen
buffer when using an EGA or VGA card:
Is it necessary to wait for the horizontal retrace before writing to
screen RAM to avoid screen flicker? I know that when writing to screen
RAM on a CGA card it is necessary because some CGA card does autosync
their task. On the 2 EGA cards that I tried the screen writing test on
the screen does not flicker so it is not necessary to wait for the
horizontal retrace. But I guess what I'm really asking is whether
this autosync mechanism is a feature in all EGA and VGA card.
If you have an answer, please let me know.

Msg 41805 is 08 line(s) on 05/09/89 from SAM LEE
to ALL re: CONTINUED FROM MSG 41804

Line 5 of message 41804 left out the word 'not' between
the 'does' and autosync, so it should read as follows:
some CGA cards do not autosync their output to screen
RAM.
Well, I guess if you are reading this message you must
have the answer to my question.
Thank you for your help.

Dear Tracy,

interested in your system. The number at work is 908-5244 and Ray
asked that you call between noon and 3 P.M. monday thru friday. If
this is not convenient let me know.
Thank you,

to SAM LEE re: R/WRITING TO EGA/VGA SCREEN

The flicker problem is only with the older CGA cards. You should be able to
write directly to video ram on all the ega and vga cards.
