to CATHY KONAS re: BBS

OK, one of the other operators (Alex Zell) saw the msg and killed it,
but in fact, it looked like - exactly like - this:
 The number if 312-338-7(9600,N,8,1)
so I didn't get the # anyway.
 BUT I should tell you - the last thing I need is ANOTHER number to call.
Sorry, not being snooty or anything, but I just don't call ANY new BBSs -
I have this one, my own simple, tired, old "Ward Board", CBBS's Co-Inventor
Randy Suess' Chinet Unix system, and being a Compuserve "sysop", I just
don't have enough hours in a day to BEGIN to peruse all the places there
are to check (I guess I could add about a jillion K of files on our
company internal bbs's, and Prodigy, and.).
 Good luck with the system! I'm envious of your CD-Rom! My system
doesn't have another slot for one, plus they don't have BYTE in that
magazine CD (plus now I'm very very mad at byte for being "fraudulent"
in their "message to our subscribers" where they say if you ask they
won't sell your name to junk mailers.) - what I'm saying is that I have
gone thru these stages:
 1. who needs CD
 2. Oh, 10 magazines? Neat! May go for it!
 3. Oops, they don't have BYTE
 4. OH, heck, I don't like byte any more
 5. but come to think of it I don't have a slot for an adapter board
heh heh
 And you think YOU RAMBLE ON? ;-)

to STEVE COHEN re: R/FLY PROGRAM

Hi Steve,
I must admit that I'm a computer hobbist and not an expert
by any means. A lot of what you said about SQL was a mystery to me.
I have never tried MS Flight Simulator. I did get Chuck Yeager's
Advanced Flight Simulator and crashed it for a long time before
getting a landing. I don't have a joy stick and that may contribute
to my problem but also running it on an 80C86 machine there are
pauses and visual interruptions that make coordinated flight
very difficult. With a joy stick, at least a 286, and VGA it
might be better.
I've read some comments from users of MS FS and it appears that
it can be mastered. It is good for proceedures but of little
practical value to actual flight training. What do you think?
Catch ya' later,
Leo

I'm not familiar with midi. I am ver interested in music. I am a Classical
guitarist and taught music in a previous life. (smile)
I am very interested in computers and music. Tell me about midi?
I have thought of trying some composition programs or simulators
but not having knowledge about them have procrastinated.
I'd be happy to hear your opinion regards any computer/music programs
or info.
Regards,
Leo

I wan't to COmpress (de-frag) a 65 meg drive and PC tools
Deluxe 4.1 doesn't want to do I read the manual but I
ould find no switch to set or whatever. How does one use
PC Tools 4.1 to compress a big hard drive?

With prodigy, you can't. they don't let you do anything usefull.

Msg 42542 is 04 line(s) on 10/01/89 from THOM QUICK
to RICHARD HINTON re: R/PC TOOLS & BIG DRIVES??

You can not de-frag a 65MB drive with PCTOOLS v 4.You will need ver
5.0 or 5.5 or Nortons Util for DOS 3.31 All of these products
will safely do the job. I have used them both. The upgrade for PCTOOLS
Delux is not very expensive.

Msg 42543 is 07 line(s) on 10/01/89 from BILL WOLFF
to ALL re: MBASIC TO GWBASIC

I would like to make a batch file or BASIC program to convert all
BASIC.BAS files to BASIC.ASC files. I have hundreds and to load
each one by typing every file sounds like the hard way. I am
taking CP/M MBASIC to MS-DOS GWBASIC. And they don't seem to work
without converting to ASCII file first? Any ideas? I do have CP/M
Plus which might make the difference. Even if it was done in MS-
DOS would work too.

]Tnx, AZ.
Sorry the log doesn't "slowly move across" like before - but the severe
line noise means that I really can't trust being in DOS very long - so
I just issue the DOS command "copy L8909+LOG" which - much to my surprise
to have learned of this on compuserve - "appends" log to l8909.  I then
"del log" and "exit" back to CBBS.
__Thus I'm apologizing for the fact that I don't keep up to your prev
call when moving the log to the l8909 file.  I just with CBBS wouldn't
screw up the log file when it crosses the rm
(sorry, wrong key)
when it crosses the 16K barrier.
