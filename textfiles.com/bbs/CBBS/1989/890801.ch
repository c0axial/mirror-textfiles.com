What do you mean "lets me out" in the line:
 "I tried it at IRQ3 and IRQ4, but that lets me out of COM ports"
 Normally, it doesn't matter if multiple interrupting sources occupy
the same irq - for example the COM3: I'm commo-ing on right now is the
same IRQ as COM1:, but since I've not got anything "going" on COM1,
i.e. no mouse driver, etc, there's nothing wrong. I can put something
on COM1:, say a plotter, and since I'm using it, but NOT the modem, there's
no problem again.

to COLIN SCHROEDER re: R/ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM

At least I have a clone (Fountain) that has run everything I could throw at
it. I use speciality software and think the bugs I find are due
to "my" use (choices). I do complain a lot but have found out that
when things are corrected, it is kept quiet (to save a free
upgrade?).

Msg 42207 is 05 line(s) on 07/30/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to ALL re: NEED COMPUTER

 Need an XT or low price AT. A hard drive is needed as well as
at LEAST Herc graphics. EGA might fit in the budget. Anyone selling
to upgrade? Have a price budget but it is high enough for a 40 meg and EGA
XT used.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/HELLO

I just found the program called "MAXI" that allows a 720K drive to be for
formatted to 800K. The only other *00K drive I know of is the MAC.
Sounds like you've really souped up your XT. I've given it some thought
but think it'll be in the cards to upgrade to a 286. I'd like to
operate the comm in the background sometimes. I just discovered my BBS
is off the air for the first time in 2 years. Seeing as the BBS is
in Penna and I'm here in Chi - it is a matter out of control.
Maybe a new computer is closer than I thought. That one has been
on continuously for over 4 years. That's a bunch of spinning for a HD
[D
I'll check in here fairly often - and get the lay of the board.
BCNU on CIS and here. -Leo-

to ALL re: THIS BBS

 Well, this looks pretty neat. First BBS ever, huh? I found the number in
some old book about BBS's. The sofware works but it's kind of cluttered,
hard to make out what the system is trying to tell you.

I run a BBS called `The Bakery' at 612-925-0900, the software is STadel.
Or if you can't call long distance, I know there are three Citadel boards
in Springfield. (Although I don't know if that's local to you.) (One
could leave a message in any of the nat'l net rooms and I would see it.)

Anyways, just though I'd stop by and say `Hi'! Catch y'all later.

Msg 42210 is 10 line(s) on 07/31/89 from DONALD CROSS
to ALL re: PROGRAMMING JOB NEEDED

Hello Chicago!
 I'm new in town. I just started going to seminary at North Park. I was
a systems programmer in my previous life, although the shop was too
small to let titles be restrictive. I have experience on IBM 4300's, DEC
and Data General minis, and a lot of experience with IBM PC's. The
last couple of years I worked on projects linking the PC's to the IBM 4341.
I am in classes, so I can't work full time, or 'normal' hours, but I would lide
like to find something, preferably working with PC's, and ideally, something
I could work on at least partially over the phone. For more info, leave a
message here, or call me at 604-8924. Thanks.
