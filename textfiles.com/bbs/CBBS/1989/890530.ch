to BRUNO RUSSO re: DOUBLE SPACED?

That is certainly a new one on me. No, there's no way of making CBBS
"Half ascii" (CR with no LF).

Msg 41863 is 07 line(s) on 05/28/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JERRY OLSEN re: R/TEST FILES NEEDED

Not sure what you mean. "test files". Will your program read a .PM3
file from pagemaker? Or will it handle PostScript?
 The way PageMaker users usually deal with typesetters is to use
"Postscript printer on disk.prn" and print to disk in Postscript
format.
 I have PageMaker, and can generate "some stuff" including scanned
TIFF files, imported postscript, etc.

to STEVE GENOVESE re: R/CHI-NET AVAILABILITY

What phone # are you calling? I think you may be calling something
other than the unregistered user line. All lines I think have
the same message ("New users log in as newuser") but will hang up if
they are not in fact a new user line.
 I think 283-0559 is a new user line.

Msg 41865 is 03 line(s) on 05/28/89 from JIM POLOUS
to ALL re: NOVELL CERTIFICATION

I am curious as to how one would go about becomming certified by Novell
for their network products. Do they have a certification program that
is offered for the chicago area.

to ALL re: MILLS BROTHERS BBS

The Mills Brothers BBS is back (formerly the AMPRO4 board, formerly the
Mill RCPM, formerly the Mills CBBS (R) - in operation since 1982).
The BBS can be reached at (312) 690-3808, 8/N/1, 2400/1200/300 baud,
and is operational 24 hours per day. The Board runs on a PC-XT Clone
with a 60 Meg hard disk drive using "PC Board" BBS Software from the
Clark Development Company in Salt Lake City, Utah. If your computer
is set to display ANSI graphics, you'll like to colors.
The Mills Brothers BBS currently offers five download sections on the
"Main" board: PC Utils, Comm, PCMag, Pix, and Jokes. In addition, we
have (currently) seven "conferences" for various topics of discussion,
each with its own upload/download area: Ham Radio, Swap Shop, Talk/Chat,
Games, Program, Database, and CP/M.
Future plans include multi-user operation, on-line gaes/programs you can
run, and greater disk storage, and possibly even a worm drive or CD.
We are currently operating in "open" mode - give us a call.
 Jim and Jeff Mills, Sysops

to JIM POLOUS re: NOVELL

Jim. Novell dealer certification is primarily based upon
training classes taken. They require you to attend classes on
network administration and on selling their product line.
They also have programs for "gold" status based on sales volume.
Sometimes they require you have and actual Netware network up and
running for demonstration. Over the years I've seen the certification
rules change many times. Their desire to saturate the market with
Netware has caused them to look the other way while gray market sales
are booming.

to ALL re: MODEL/TYPE FOR PCJR

What is/was the official IBM designation for the original PC-Jr. I'm not
sure if IBM calls it MODEL Number or TYPE but you probably kmow what I mean.
If anyone is aware as to this number I would appreciate it.
Thanks in advance,
James Schmidt
