Msg 42713 is 19 line(s) on 11/02/89 from BILL WOLFF
to MARTY DIPPEL re: R/HAYES COMMANDS?

It appears that I replied to myself with message number 42705. It was
suppose to go to MARTY DIPPEL (sorry Marty) So I deleted it and the below
is a reprint. Ward don't worry about the board acting up! I have the flu
and my head isn't on straight (cough! cough!) sorry!

Thanks a lot for your input, I have received info of the dips and some
"&" command set. So for the most part, I should have everything I need.
But if someone knows some helpful info the manual has that us with
Hayes compatible intelligence would not know, please share it.
Thanks!

Also I do have the MIGENT and it's manual. The reason I question it is
because althought it is Hayes compatible, it lacks a speaker, only stores
one number, and powers itself down when the RS-232 floats. I first
bought it for my Epson PX-8, but it powers down (the modem) when I entered
my download or upload menu! Real bad news! The modem would just hang-up!
No problems on other computer although! Just the PX-8 is comserving
power I think! It does a good job too. Runs 20 hours on a charge. Not
handy with "The Pocket Modem" though! <BW>
