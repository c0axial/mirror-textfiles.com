Thanks for the tip on Kisors board, Jim. BTW, I'm >not< from San
Francisco-rather LA-LA land, and North Hollywood to get specific.
Living so close to all the studios is probably why I'm spoiled at
having access to a great number of bbses devoted to writing (although
most of the users were tv and film screenwriters). My main reason for
wanting a "writers board" is to have an appropriate place to post my
cache of original limericks (many rather bawdy and for adult eyes
only), and also to network for possible employment opportunities.
I was just beginning to build up a nice home-based freelance editing,
copywriting, etc. business in L.A. when my husband was relocated here.
So, I'm now starting from scratch again. If any board(s) are useful
for either or both these purposes, it doesn't truly matter if it's
a "writers board." Again, thanks for responding and leaving the
info.ttyl.Kathleen
p.s. BTW, I'm very partial to the powers of this communications medium.
My husband and I met long-distance over a NYC bbs (the former Ailanthus
Tree), and basically fell in love in E-mail months before we actually
met.but that's another story.bye.Kathleen

I am currently making a bbs program on the Atari ST, (No this isn't an atari
message) and I am at the File Transfer stage. I got a copy of a file document
ing Xmodem Ymodem and CRC checking, but Im afraid that the CRC checking
part is a bit over my head. Its kind of unclear. It speaks of Multiplying
<Correction, dividing> X^16 by X^1023. Am I readting this right? And what
number does that variable X stand for? Can anyone help me here? Perhaps
give me and equation that I can use, or atleast get some idea of what's
going on in a CRC check?


 I would REALLY appreciate any help. I'm not a mathmatition, just a
first year college student. Heh. Thankyou.

to MICHAEL SZEWCZYK re: R/XMODEM CRC

If you haven't already done so, call Ward's other board at 849-1132 and
look through the low-numbered messages. One of them includes a short
C function that lists the algorithm for the CRC computation. You might also
look at an old issue of Dr. Dobbs that had CRC routines in it (early 1987,
I think).

It's best not to worry about the division, which is really part of the
theoretical basis for the algorithm. The actual implementation involves
shifting a 16-bit integer left 8 times, and XORing it with a value in
certain cases. In fact, I dragged out a listing for an old Commodore term
program I wrote and can tell you the algorithm:

Let CRL be the low-order byte of the CRC, CRH be the high-order byte, and
C be the character being sent or received. Let A be a temporary variable.
Set A=C XOR CRH. Do the following 8 times:
1) Shift CRL left, with the high bit going into the carry and 0 going into
the low bit.
2) Shift A left, with the carry from the previous operation going into the
low bit.
3) If the above operation resulted in a carry, set A=A XOR 10HEX and set
CRL=CRL XOR 21HEX.
After 8 iterations, set CRH=A.

That's really an 8-bit implementation, and enough familiarity has come back
to let me simplify it a bit. Try this:
1) XOR the high-order byte of CRC with C.
2) Do the following 8 times:
3) Shift CRC left. If a carry results, XOR CRC with 1021HEX
That's it.

OK, Mike, do give me a call so that we can discuss it. I had the modem
repaired by the manufacturer after I bought it from Randy, however, if
my memory serves me correctly it sarted going intermittant after I used
it for about a year. I replaced it with and external modem, but never
re-tested it again to see if my problem really was the modem. (You have
to remember, early ALTAIRS were also a bit flakey from time to time.)
Incidently - my two EARLY ALTAIRS both ran last time I fired them up
about a year ago! (My ALTAIRS are also prized posessions.)
 Call me when you get a chance to. SEEYA, Roger.

 Uhm, i don't want you to think I'm an idiot, but that kind of went
over my head. Let me see if I have this strait.

CRL=Low Byte
CRH=High Byte
C =Character being sent
A =Temp Variable

Ok, assuming I am using X-Modem. Would C be the added values of the Ascii
codes of the 128 characters sent?

Define - Low Byte, High Byte

And, lastly, I dont quite understand what you meen by "Shift" this here or
there.

 I'm kind of confused. And really, I do appreciate this help you're giving
me. (Im not very well aquainted with C.)

I Have a DOS 4.01 or WP 5.0 problem but don't know which.
I am not sure if I have a DOS 4.01 problem or a Wordperfect 5.0 but here
is the description:

 1) Run Wordperfect 5.0 (I am at 11-15-88 level)
 2) Shell to DOS <CTRL> F1
 3) Goto DOS 1
 4) Exit back to WP EXIT
 5) Exit WP F7
 6) Nosave N
 7) Exit Y

 From the DOS prompt:

 Delete nonexistant file DEL XXXX
 Issue any SET command SET ABC=DEF
 Execute any EXE program MEM
 At this point I get the message:

 Invalid COMMAND.COM
 Unable to load Command, System Halted

My question is: Is this a DOS or WP problem. How do I determine where to
point the finger? Only fails after running WP 5.0. Does not fail with
DOS 3.3.

Msg 41474 is 12 line(s) on 03/15/89 from JERRY OLSEN
to JAMES SCHMIDT re: R/DOS 4.01 OR WP 5.0 PROBLEM?

Can't necessarily say what the source of your problem is for certain, but
the error message you're getting is being provided directly from the
operating system, not from WP. I've seen similar experiences with other
combinations of DOS and applications, and it sounds most likely that you
have two copies of COMMAND.COM somewhere on your system-floppy and/or
hard drive. Take a program like LOCATE, WHEREIS or FILEFIND and do a:
LOCATE <drive>:COMMAND.COM and see if there's a "stray" copy around from
other than your current version of DOS. (And if so, REMOVE it.) Depending
how you installed WP, it's possible it's looking to a different directory
than your normal COMSPEC.

Good luck.

to ALL re: EXE2BIN QUERY

I've written a little interactive batch-command processor which works fine
as an .EXE file but yields strange results when turned it into a .COM
file with EXE2BIN. My program's written in Turbo C using the tiny model so
it in theory could be turned into a .COM file, and I haven't added any
"fancy" routines which should conflict with the conversion.EXE2BIN
offers no complaints, and the program runs fine with one and only one
apparent bug.My program optionally parses a command line like:

C>BATCH command1 /switches;command2;.;command n =my-own-switches-here

into discrete commands which are EXECed via COMMAND.COM. However, in the
.COM version, I always get a spurious character or two after the last of
the commands, which my program dutifully accepts as a legal part of the
command during parsing if they're printable characters. (This happens
regardless of whether my own switches are used or avoided.).My program
does permit editing of the parsed commands, depending upon a "quiet-mode"
switch, and after editing all works fine. But if I could find
and fix the source of this strangeness it would avoid my only reasonable
current solution, leaving the thing as an .EXE file. Any ideas? Thanx.

 It sounds like you might have an extra copy of command.com in there

The Dos 3.3 Command.com doesn't work with Dos 4.x so you have to be

I've talked to other users on CIS and other BBS's and they can create
that same problem. Talked to WP Customer Service and mailed them a DOS

]Hi Ward!  Long time, no talk.  I saw the article in the Trib's Tempo
section today, glad to see it mentions you and Randy as developers
of CBBS, too bad it didn't give the phone number like it did for two
other BBSes.  Owell, maybe talk to you later -- thinking about starting
my BBS up again (it's been idle 6 months+), but this time on a PC instead
of CP/M.  Wonder what you've read/heard about different BBS programs
for the PC?  Catch you later.

to PAUL STREETER re: CBBS LOGONS

CBBS is "coded" to take 3 "any chars" to wake up - I wait for the MODEM
to tell me the speed - yet some times it seems to take more like 6 or
so. Basically, my CBBS logon script doesn't care how many it takes -
the script file line is:
 pat; pat 1i CBBS
 pat 2i Welcome
 pf1
 while n put "\r" wait
 sleep 1
 put \013
 pat 1 "1st time"
 pat 3 "FIRST"
 wait
 What that does is set up pattern 1 to Immediately match "CBBS",
and also set up pattern 2 to immediately recognize "Welcome." should
that slip by (normally the ^K will prevent the welcome, but now
100%).
 PF1 sets the pattern fail time to 1 second, then the WHILE sends a
CR until either a CBBS or a Welcome shows up.
 I then sleep for .1 second (sleeps are in .1 sec intervals), and
put a \013 - a ^K, then go on.

Carey Hidaka is probably the guy to talk to - call 245-2000. I don't know
if any positions are open or not. Manuel was an "outstanding" candidate.
 P.S. I don't get the bit about driving 30 miles - I > think < the jobs
are only open to students - or at least that is the implication - but
come to think of it I'm not sure.

not sure I can R/W 'em any more.

Msg 41488 is 12 line(s) on 03/16/89 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to JAMES SCHMIDT re: R/DOS 4.01/WP 5.0

I have a friend who is running WP 4.2 under MS-DOS 3.30 on genuine
IBM equipment (an ancient 4.77 MHz PC). She has been getting the
same message on exiting to DOS, and the machine hangs. HOWEVER. We
have reason to suspect a problem with at least one RAM chip. It may
be the case that WP 5 places greater demands on memory, and certain
marginal chips are showing up. Suggestion: Some of the folks out
there with this problem are probably using 8/10/12 MHz machines
running at 12 MHz. Suggest that they should try running WP in a
slower mode (or make sure they're using wait states) and see if the
problem goes away. I don't know if this will fix things, but, given
the truly marginal RAM I've seen in some clones, it seems worth a
shot.

Msg 41489 is 09 line(s) on 03/16/89 from JAMES SCHMIDT
to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/DOS 4.01/WP 5.0

I agree totally that a bad RAM chip can cause a whole slew of bizzare
problems. I have been involved with several other WP 5.0 users on
Compuserve that past week or so and several other users can
recreate the problem. Can all those users have bad RAM. And besides
it does not fail with IBM DOS 3.3 and it makes a difference as
to what screen font WP is configured to use. If a RAM chip is bad I
think the version of DOS and screen font whould make minimal difference.
Yes? No?

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: ARTICLE IN TODAY'S TRIB

ward, i don't know if you receive the chicago tribune, but in today's
edition, in the Tempo section, there was an article on bbs communication
that mentioned you and Randy. it is reproduced below (verbatim)
 'The founding fathers'
 That was no problem for the two men who in 1978 invented the computer
bulletin board, Randy Seuss (sic) of Chicago and Ward Christensen of south
suburban Dalton. Both were members of the Chicago Area Computer Hobbyist
Exchange, and it occurred to them that CACHE needed a place to exchange
messages. So one snowy weekend, Christensen hacked out a bulletin board
program, and Seuss (sic) put up the board in his basement. They called it
CBBS/Chicago (for Computer Bulletin Board System/Chicago), and trademarked
the name.
 "The trademark sounds silly today because the name sounds so generic,"
says Christensen. "But remember it was the first one, when 'bulletin board'
would have meant cork and push pins. And CBBS/Chicago (545-8086) was set
up as a message board, not a download board. It still is. I'd rather
have people sharing ideas rather than programs. Otherwise it's just tied
up hour after hour with downloading."
 Nevertheless, it was Christensen who invented Xmodem, the first program
to detect and correct errors as programs were sent from one computer to
another. Without error checking, telephone line noise may add bogus bits
and bytes to software, rendering it useless. Without error checking,
BBSes would still be message boards.

the article begins with a discussion of popular BBSes nationwide (like
Exec-PC) and ends with a section on Andrew Fluegelman's PC-Talk and
shareware/freeware.
just thought that you would be interested in the above excerpts.

to ALL re: NEW CHICAGO USER

Greetings, I am born and bred Chicagoan, returning from a four
year stint in the jungles of New York City; I finished a master program
in business at NYU, and learned how to use my PC. Now I would like to
find out about what's available in BBSes. Can someone tell me where I
can get the Darwin USBBS list?

Msg 41492 is 11 line(s) on 03/16/89 from MARTY DIPPEL
to WARD re: CONGRATULATIONS!

I also saw the article in today's paper. Just wanted to pass along my
congrats, and wish you best of luck on getting the original CBBS
hardware into the Smithsonian. Any luck on finding another prop for
the water heater? I wonder if there is any hope of getting the originalsystem functional again?
I left this question on chinet, but post it here as well: How did you
ever meet Randy? Were you friends before the inspiration for CBBS struck?
And- just how did all this BBS stuff get started, anyway? This might
be better discussed over pizza than here, but in light of all the hist-
orical interest, could you give it an abbreviated shot here? I'll bet
I'm not the only one who's curious!

Msg 41493 is 14 line(s) on 03/16/89 from MARTY DIPPEL
to ALL re: ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

I'm writing a batch file in MS-DOS that adds a variable to the environment.
In my particular case, I call it USR. It contains the login ID that I
will later use (by another batch file) to keep user's directories separate.
Here's the problem: I'm using an HP Vectra that uses a DOS shell (PAM).
One of the menu choices from PAM is "MS-DOS Commands". Once selected, it
invokes COMMAND.COM to give me a command interpreter. While using this
new shell, I create the environment variable. If I return to PAM (using
the command EXIT ) then return to COMMAND.COM, I find my variable has
disappeared. Odd, since the rest of the environment (PROMPT, SHELL, etc.)
survives intact.

Is there a way of "exporting" environment variables so they survive the
termination of the current command processor?
