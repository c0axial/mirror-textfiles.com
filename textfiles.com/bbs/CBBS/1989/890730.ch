OK, ya, I should have some time. Could you tell me what you are trying
to do, i.e. if -I- were programming to YOUR design, what would you tell
me you wanted? I just feel that by "looking" at a PageMaker file, with
the idea of learning much, might be like looking at glass and trying to
see the sand, or looking at a packaged chip and trying to see the silicon.

to ALL re: IRQ/MIDI PROBLEMS

First, let me describe my equipment
 Wyse 386 16 Mhz, 1 Meg RAM
 2 serial, 1 parallel
 1.2 Mbyte drive
 1.4 Mbyte drive
 WD-1003-RA2 RLL Hard disk controller
 with Seagate ST-277R
 Packard Bell PBVGA (512K) - Mfd by STB (Simply the Best)
 Copy II pc Option Board
 The Complete Hand Scanner
 Epson Apex 80 Printer
 Multiscan Monitor
 MSC Omnimouse
 Zuckerboard Mini I/O (Joystick, COM4, and LPT2)
 Ad Lib Music Card
 CMS-401 MIDI Card

I realize that this is a lot of stuff here, but my problem is getting
the MIDI card to work properly. It seems that there is a conflict
with several of the IRQs in my system.
The default and normal setting of the MIDI card is IRQ2,
but it won't cooperate with my VGA card (I'm assuming)
I tried it at IRQ3 and IRQ4, but that lets me out of COM ports
I tried IRQ5 and IRQ6, one just locked up the computer, the other
gave me a disk controller error. I have it set as IRQ7, which is for
the printer. This is fine for now, since I'm out of paper. But If I try
to print anything.lock up city. My VGA card IRQ can't be changed, I loo
looked into that. Any ideas????

to JIM POLOUS re: R/IRQ/MIDI PROBLEMS

It looks like you're out of luck unless you can get your MIDI card to
generate one of the extra interrupts available on an AT bus (forget
about it if it's an 8-bit card. IRQ 2 is the ONLY one that could even
be available, unless you want to share it with one of the COM port
interrupts (shouldn't create a conflict if you aren't using that COM
port and the MIDI card at the same time).

to ALL re: DOSSHELL 4.01 ENVIRONMENT

{IBMDOS 4.0 with UR65066 installed.
Has anybody noticed that when you use the "SHIFT-F9 DOS Prompt" facility
of DOSSHELL that only the CURRENT SIZE of the Environment is allocated
to the new process ? In otherwords it seems the /E:XXXX parm on the
config.sys SHELL= is not propigated via this mechanism.
This results in the infamous 'Out of Environment Space' when running BAT
files that try to SET Environment variables. This makes the "SHIFT-F9"
somewhat less useful in my estimation.
It there a way to pass the equivalent of the /E:XXXX to the child
process when invoking "SHIFT-F9" ??
f*I've created a workaround by adding my own DOS SHELL Option to the menu
system where I invoke COMMAND /E:XXXX myself and it works ok but it
takes of a valuable menu slot.
Does this sound like a BUG maybe I discovered a FEATURE ?
BTW this is a IBMDOS 4.01 installation I have no idea if it applies to
MSDOS.
Thanks in advance,
James Schmidt

to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM

Richard: sorry to hear that 4.01 was such a chunbk of cash. Good luck
with
MS, but I have doubts about their willingness to patch SHELL, much less
fess up to their MAJOR error! Here's an interesting little story
about mfr. arrogance: our software (SYGRAPH) uses the GSS device
driver set for graphics, and we determined fairly early on that there
was a bug in COMPAQ dos version 3.1 releases A and B which prevented
the drivers from working. COMPAQ steadfastly maintained that it was
not a bug, yet fixed it in 3.1 release C! One of our users called
up with the standard difficulties (hung system); he had release B. We
told him that COMPAQ should replace it with a newer version free, but
COMPAQ refused to replace it free, quite arrogantly telling him that
he would have to shell out $70 for version 3.2!
 I tell you this not to discourage you but to encourage a healthy
skepticism about big software conglomerates! And I think you SHOULD
push for a patch/fix! I'll keep fingers crossed for you

to ALL re: 386 UNIX INFO?

Dear folks:
 I'm looking for info on different 386 based UNIX systems which also
n DOS programs as tasks (e.g. VP/ix, UNIX w/ DOSmerge 386, etc.)
cifically, I'd like info. on your experiences w/ such systems, and
ur recommendations as to which version of pc UNIX you like best.
 The reason for all this is that I'm going to be upgrading to UNIX,
d would like to be able to run a couple of my old DOS programs which
ve no UNIX equivalents (e.g. SYSTAT).
 What I need in a UNIX system is DOS task capability, Xwindows,
plications development environment with C and FORTRAN compiler/linker,
xt editing such as vi, and VGA graphics capabilities. Other utilities
h as AWK would be nice too.
 Thanks in advance for your help!
