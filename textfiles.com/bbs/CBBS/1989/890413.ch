to PAUL STREETER re: R/ PREDICTIONS

Hey, great comments!
 Yes, Metra is a bit better - the main thing that makes laptopping
possible is the "upper deck" of the old IC line - where you're not
elbow-to-elbow with anyone.
 My T1100+ works "ok", but 10# is just too much to lug around
regularly. Worst, I use it all day at work so it doesn't get charged
very well. I DO try to take it home monthly for a few deep discharges.
 Quick Cobol? An oxymoron if I ever heard one!

Msg 41670 is 03 line(s) on 04/11/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN

What, no Comdex reports yet? I'm going Tuesday.
 I have one early report I picked up from Compuserve, it is 30 lines
long so will go into next message: "Deskjet Plus".

to ALL re: UCSD-P SYSTEM?

So what is UCSD-P system good for now? Does anyone use it? Is there
any worth while programs written for it? Even in Public Domain? Is it
somewhat compatable with Pascal or Turbo Pascal?

Msg 41673 is 04 line(s) on 04/11/89 from JERRY OLSEN
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/QBASIC

Sounds like by far the simplest solution for your needs (assuming all
your data are "printable" characters) is simply to set the high bit
to "encrypt" and reset it for use. (I.e., OR each character with 80H,
then AND it with 7FH.) Good luck.

Msg 41674 is 28 line(s) on 04/11/89 from JERRY OLSEN
to FRANK SPIVEY II re: RUNNING A BBS

Running a "good" BBS does indeed involve quite a bit of time and nurturing.
After getting it up and running, it involves time every day without
fail both to meet its basic needs and to protect oneself from potential
legal problems. All that aside, one soon becomes dissatisfied with
at least SOME aspect(s) of the software, and probably will want to
invest time in enhancing it. And of course there are the inevitable
problems. And when they creep in, usually immediate attention is necessary
-not at a more convenient time, say, on the weekend. Then there's
the necessity of message-base purging, etc. And if you will be having
file transfer capability, as Ward noted, that involves time too. Besides
the issues he mentioned, you'd almost certainly want to institute (and
follow through on) validation procedures. As a sysop, I view that as
a basic requirement to protect callers. You NEED to be able to keep track
of callers to protect against the very occasional intentional uploader
of bogus software.There's more, but that's a start. In short, it's
a real commitment to do it "right." (And there are more than a few
places out there that do a poor job.).I don't want to discourage
you, but I've worked with many people wanting to set up systems and
it's best they know what's involved BEFORE committing themselves, and
before building a constituency only to go off-line a few months later
(a common occurrence). But if you have the time, the funds and the
energy, it provides real satisfaction.As for modems, the one you
mention sounds fine from what I've read (but haven't used). In general,
be sure it's <100%> Hayes compatible (or otherwise if fully supported
by your software. BBSes place significantly greater demands upon modems
in terms of commands and reliability than more common applications,
and you don't want to create unnecessary headaches with hardware. (The
software problems are enough!) Good luck.

Msg 41675 is 06 line(s) on 04/11/89 from JERRY OLSEN
to DAN SEIBOLD re: R/SWAPPING BOARDS

There are quite a few ways you could run into trouble. I'd suspect that the
system-specific issues are going to lead you into too many headaches in
the long run. I'd also be concerned about the ability to move up to a
later version of the OS as well.which is something you're going to
want to be able to do to run some more contemporary software. (BTW, I've
posted a reply to your other query over my way.)

Msg 41676 is 11 line(s) on 04/11/89 from JERRY OLSEN
to ALAN LAYA re: R/PASCAL EXEC-ING

Like Eric, I don't have experience with TP but regularly use EXEC-ing
in C. Yes, DO ensure your command-line arguments are EXACTLY right.
If you can put up a sample of a command line that does work and one
that causes problems, it might help a bit in determining the source
of the problem. In the meantime, here's a long shot: If something like
COMMAND GWBASIC BOO doesn't work, try COMMAND /C GWBASIC BOO, which
is simply a way to tell COMMAND.COM to execute the command line, then
return to the calling program. I use that with an "on the fly" batch
command processor I wrote to avoid a similar problem. Other than that,
unless you have some examples, I'd say to ENSURE that you've got spacing
just right (esp. no spaces in unwanted places). Good luck.

Msg 41680 is 10 line(s) on 04/11/89 from ALAN LAYA
to ALL re: TP4 EXEC PROBS

Thanks a million to all (esp. Eric and Jerry) who took the time to
ponder my so-called "problem" with the TP4 "exec" function. In case
y'all are wondering, the solution was somewhat unexpected, but after a
few tinkering sessions I finally found a way to make it work: by
simply not "mentioning" the command processor at all.i.e. instead
of using exec('wp.exe','command.com'); I used exec('wp.exe',' ');.
and believe it or not, it seems to work (for now anyway).
And now I'm off on a mision to find out why this is so.
Any ideas?
