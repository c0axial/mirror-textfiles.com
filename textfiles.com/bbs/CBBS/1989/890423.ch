Msg 41710 is 14 line(s) on 04/20/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to TOBOR RETROZETTI re: REPLY

Howdy, fellow Wisconsonite. (I'm from West Bend, about 30 mi. N. of
Milw, 17 miles in from the lake).
 How do you page the SYSOP? What's that? I live about 40 miles
from the system. There is a CHAT function, but Randy, the hardware
guy, doesn't answer it. He's busy with "bigger and better" things
(literally - a multi-user Unix system).
 Can you enter a message E-mail to me? I don't know what you mean by
"Email" - do you mean "private"? The only semi-private messages are
the ones you leave as comments when you say (G)ood bye. However, there
are a half dozen folks who have priviliges to see the log.
 Why, if your bulliten (sic) is so important, didn't you at least SAY
what the general subject was?
 Everyone is welcome to leave msgs on CBBS for all to see providing the
msgs are about the supported topics (see the (B)ulletin command).
No msg 41711

Msg 41712 is 07 line(s) on 04/21/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to GARY ELFRING re: MCS DISKS

Jerry has told me that he's seen a program running on an MS-DOS machine
that can access the MCS disks, so I doubt there's any controller inco
incompatibility. We suspect that the disks are written in a BIOS-compatible
way. What he really needs is a disk editor that can read and write
arbitrary sectors and that can deal with a non-dos disk (i.e. doesn't
try to determine free space, count subdirectories, etc.) to see if
this suspicion is correct.

Msg 41713 is 18 line(s) on 04/21/89 from JERRY OLSEN
to GARY ELFRING re: R/MCS DISK

To follow up on the "latest" after Eric's msg, I've thus far been able to at
least access the disk with a program designed for reading/writing <<CP/M>>
disks. (It has a mode that lets you set some parameters.) It is, however,
too limited for ideal use. So I still am looking for a disk editor
(similar to the old DU-Vxx CP/M program) which logs in the A: drive
and does <nada> till a track/sector is provided.Beyond that, by
far my greatest interest is someone who has written routines to read
from/write to MCS disks. I've captured the first track and so have
a rough idea about the directory structure. But the real specifics
of exactly what must be updated when, determining free sectors, etc.,
are still a mystery. At the moment, I'm taking a back-door approach.
A friend with MCS hardware is providing a freshly formatted disk, plus
another which (again, after fresh formatting) contains two carefully
selected files with known structure/length/etc. The idea is to see
how the disk has been altered by MCS hardware itself. A slow, trial
and error process; but till I can get some hard data or someone with
direct experience.
 In any case, thanx for the thoughts, though.

to ALL re: AT&T MOTHERBOARD REPAIR

Does anyone know a reasonable shop where I can have an AT&T PC6300+
motherboard repaired? WHen I power up, all I get is the LEDs on the
keyboard flickering forever, no video at all! I am looking for a
repair shop that won't charge me more than the price of a new clone
to fix it. Any suggestions??

Msg 41715 is 06 line(s) on 04/21/89 from JOHN MUNDT
to ALL re: BARCODE READERS

Anyplace in Chicago have barcode reading pens? Specifically, I'd
like them to fit into an RS-232 port along with the keyboard, or
have the keyboard plug into them, and then the unit into the port.
Several mail-order places in CA advertie, specifically TPS
Electronics in Palo Alto and Worthington Data Solutions in Santa
Cruz, but it is a little far to drop in and look at the units.

Msg 41716 is 04 line(s) on 04/21/89 from BOB SULLIVAN
to ALL re: DISK LIFE

 Has anyone read of what the life of an unused disk is?
In other words, if I save a file to a disk in 1989 and store the
disk in a filing cabinet, will the disk be good 5, 10, 25 years
from now?

Msg 41717 is 03 line(s) on 04/21/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to JOHN MUNDT re: R/BARCODE READERS

I believe Microbyte Systems in Arlington Heights carries at least one
bar-code reader. Don't really know the details, but they're a retailer
located on Palatine Road.

Msg 41718 is 07 line(s) on 04/22/89 from JAMES SCHMIDT
to JOHN MUNDT re: R/BARCODE READERS

John,
 I believe INTERMEC has what you are looking for. The correct term is
WEDGE READER. It wedges between the keyboard and the PC. They are not
cheap. I am not sure of their exact address but I believe they are
in the Northwest suburbs.
Hope this is of help.
