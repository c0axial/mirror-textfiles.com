to BARRY POLLACK re: 9600 BAUD CBBS

CBBS has been up and down over the last few days - at one point,
something apparently bumped the switch powering the modem, and Randy
didn't notice for a while; there were other problems in which CBBS was
down - perhaps a power outage - Randy found it as if it had just been
booted one time.
 There is not a lot of 9600 baud access - myself, Mike Andrews formerly
(until yesterday) of USR, and David Gibbs, are the 9600 baud callers.

to SAM LEE re: R/WRITING TO EGA/VGA SCREEN

I've found no EGA or VGA that requires waiting. However, I got a real
surprise - I had a program on my VGA Clone, that rapidly changed the
VGA palette register. On my clone, the register didn't change that fast
(I didn't really notice that) but I didn't have to waitfor retrace
or anything.
 Then, much to my embarassement, I took the program to an IBM PC fair,
and ran it on an IBM model 80 VGA, and whaddyaknow, it flickered
unbearably.
 SO, you MAY have to synchronize the PALETTE REGISTER CHANGES if you're
going to do them a lot. I didn't persue this since I didn't really
care if it ran on the 80 or not - it worked OK for me at home.

Good,
I'm glad the chip worked out fine. The 80c287 worked out well but
still haven't checked it out with Autocad 10. I don't expect any
chip failures the first year. Keep in touch.

Hello, I got your number from Lillipute in Chicago one
of the users there recommended I ask you for Lloyd Smith's
phone number. I am interested in setting up a bar code scanner
system at work. Excuse the sloppy message the
extra characters I'm getting through the phone
line are frustrating to say the least. Hope you can
decypher it. Thanks,
Peter

Thanks for the info. I talked with several places, and other than
some copyright concerns they could convert the tapes; however, the cost
is about $50 per half-hour. My tape is about 2 1/2 hours. I'll just hold on to
to it.

to ALL re: NEED COMPUTER

A friend of mine has/had a Kaypro II and it is/had died! I like to
find him a replacement at a good cost or have his computer repaired.
Any ideas or offers accepted. Thanks!

Can be any CP/M computer that runs DBASE, WordStar, etc. If IBM computer
offered. Then a copy of each one included in the offer would be nice.
IBM DBASE is compatable with CP/M DBase file right? Version 2.4 DBASE?

Msg 41821 is 30 line(s) on 05/15/89 from JERRY OLSEN
to BILL WOLFF re: R/NEED COMPUTER

Finding a place to repair CP/M machines is difficult at best. Ditto for
finding a used Kaypro II, though not quite so. He also may have trouble
reinstalling some of his Kaypro-specific versions of software on other
CP/M machines. Best bet by far would be to look for a used Kaypro of a
<later> vintage than that of the IIs. They're all going cheap. (He shouldn't
have to pay more than $300 for a Kaypro 10-the hard-drive machine-if he
shops a little. A Kaypro 4 often goes for $100 or less these days, and
should run his K II software fine. About the only thing he should be
careful about is a Kaypro 1 (which has a different, and infamous "universal"
ROM-a "U-ROM"). Software for it vs. other CP/M Kaypros isn't <always>
100% compatible. Putting messages up around CP/M boards often will snag a
CP/M Kaypro fairly quickly-CFOG, The Advocate (312-939-3300), etc.
As for portability of dBASE to an MS-DOS environment, it's not all tht
difficult, but it's likely he'll have to modify some .CMD files. (It gets
more complicated if he gets into the latest dBASE versions, though.)
WordStar files will port over fine.Does this more or less answer all
of your questions?

In terms of his older machine, if your friend or you can deal with
rummaging around inside the hardware, often you can fix the problems yourself.
The K IIs were rather simple machines, and often the problem can be
diagnosed reasonably reliably by someone who has had such a beast. I've
done a fair bit of that myself, as have others on The Advocate, where you
might care to leave a message (as well as here) about <specific> symptoms
when-and before-the machine bit the dust.If your friend doesn't want
to bother with such work and is just planning on tossing it, I'd welcome
hearing from him or her. I run a BBS on a Kaypro 10, and <some> parts are
interchangable betweeen the machines, if he'd care to make it a (tax-
deductible) gift. If interested, again, leave word on The Advocate (to Sysop),
and include a number where I could call to chat about it. Good luck.

I have an Osborne Executive and have a need to run a Centronics parallel
printer. Centronics has 36 pins and the IEEE-484 is the same type of
connector, but only has 24 pins. Anybody know where I can get one?
