to ALL re: WHATS SCOOP ON PRODIGY

My modem has been out for three weeks and I have been on the system with a
spare 300 baud. I know have my 2400 back in operation and I have been
looking at many messages concerning prodigy. I wondered if anyone on this
board has tried the setup. What other operations besides Email ect.
Is there any demos in the area besides way north in Skokie ? Or can you
get information from any Sears. If there is a demo in the near future
some where a bit closer to the south side please let me know ! Maybe a
few of us could get together and go.
 Thanks

to JIM SACKETT re: R/WHATS SCOOP ON PRODIGY

Jim,
 Even though it will cost you some, I suggest that you go ahead and get
a Prodigy kit at Sears. Since you get a 30 trial with ability to get a
refund, it is not really a risk. (I meant 30 day trial). I wish that
I had one of the "free" 90 day kits that Ward C. mentioned but this
was only to the Computer Club he goes to. It is interesting that CFOG
only gets 30 days free! [Ward, now we have proof that you are among the
true insiders. What ever that means.] Brent

to ROGER PAULSON re: R/STORES/ PROBLEMS.

 I got bothe the Award and Phoenix Bios with my 386. I can use whichever
suits me but I like the Award. The difference is a lot to do with
how much memory I have. I can have 1,2,6 etc with Award or 1,4,etc
with Phoenix. Kind of screwy but I didn't pay extra. good deal.

to ALL re: RS-232 SPEED

Boy I was just working on a computer with a 7" screen with 2400 baud.
But now, I switched to one of my other computers (yes, I have many)
with a 14" monitor and only 1200 baud. Boy it's like driving a sports
car, then moving to a truck. Wow!

Msg 42422 is 22 line(s) on 09/01/89 from ROY PLUM
to BILL WOLF re: DTP WITH HP LASERJET SERIES II

I am using aan HP LaserJet Series II printer for DTP and technical
illustrations. I have upgrtaded it to postscript compatability
using QMS Jetscript board available from Elek-tek for about $1700.00.
This is a postscript interpreter on a card in the PC with a 68000
processor and about 3 meg RAM. It drives the LaserJet directly through
the option port via a plug in board. The Laser Jet retains its full
capabilities and normal connections (and HP's waranty. they even
offer tech assistance for it on HP's phone number.) For me this gives
the best of both worlds. I have teh LaerJet for regular DOS printing
with some downloadable fonts, or when I need more, a postscript printer
with scalable fonts. Incedently, a full page of type with heavy
graphics prints FASTER in postscript mode than in PCL. The Postscript
text file is transfered to the card at the bus speed, much faster than
through a com port at 19200 baud (for the apple laserwriter IINT)
Another solution for much less mony would be to get Freedom of Press
software. This is a P{ostscript interpreter that can RIP (Raster Image
Process) a ppostscript file and send it as a bit map to any number of
suported printers including cCalcomp's color printers and hp paintJet
See publish magazine or PC puiblisher to find out where to get it. You'll
have to print the job to a file as if you were going to send it to a
service bureau for 1270 dpi output on typesetting paper. then
process the postscript file with Freedom of Press.
