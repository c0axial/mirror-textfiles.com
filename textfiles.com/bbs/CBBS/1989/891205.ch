to BOB SULLIVAN re: R/PSION ORGANISER

 What are you looking to do with the Organizer? I've seen 'em at
a store in downtown (which was out of biz last time I checked).
 I also saw 'em at Comdex, and their "new" machine.
 The Organizer is a small computer, in a very - to me - ungainly
shape - about like a "Fluke" digital multimeter. In other words, the
vertical format and thickness leave a lot to be desired. However, it
DOES seem to work out well for some applications. I guess I'm just not
into "dedicated applications" for which it might be appropriate.
 What is YOUR application?

Msg 42838 is 14 line(s) on 12/03/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: USING GRANDVIEW?

 Anyone else using Grandview? Any comments on it?
 Grandview is a very good outliner for the PC. It was written by the
same author as PC Outline, which came under problems due to being sold
to Brown Bag. John Friend has really done a nice job with GV, but it
commands a premium price (around $200).
 It really helps you organize your thoughts in outline form, so you
can see just the main headings, or any level of detail you wish. You
can export and import a variety of formats, as well as of course, print
either to printer or disk.
 What attracted me to it was the totally customizable keyboard. Even
when there wasn't a key to do something I wanted, I was able to define
a macro executed by a control key, that "simulated" the function - i.e.
so now that the macro is defined, I don't even notice that the key does
anything unusual. Nicely, the macro def's are loaded automatically.

Msg 42839 is 15 line(s) on 12/03/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: STOCKS SPREADSHEET?

 Anyone have any thoughts about the best way to organize a spreadsheet
for keeping track of stock transactions? Basically what I do is create:
 name date buy/sell shares cost charges total
for headings, with buy/sell being a 1 or -1 so that I simply multiply
the costs by that column to get a + or - value. I then total vertically,
to give me the net of a buy/sell transaction. Example:
 IBM 12/01/88 -1 10 123.00 50 -1280.00
 IBM 03/03/89 -1 10 117.00 45 -1215.00
 IBM 12/01/89 1 20 97.50 90 1860.00 -635.00
i.e. the final line sums the total lines.
 Anyone have any better ideas? One of the problems I have is stocks that
are bought one year and sold another - I guess I just have to keep them
in my spreadsheet forever, then do my taxes based upon only those I bought
and sold in a particular year. Now that there's no long term vs short
term, that part is easier to compute.

Msg 42840 is 15 line(s) on 12/03/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: QUATTRO-PRO

 Just received my official copy of Quattro Pro. Boy, what a spreadsheet!
It has such a good graph annotater that it can be used to produce simple
charts independent of any spreadsheet numbers (this is called a "text
chart").
 It displays in graphics mode (ega/vga) or in EGA 43 line or VGA 50
line, or of course 25 line mode.
 The formula capabilits are very nice, but I'm not qualified to compare
it to anything else - I avoided Lotus all these years due to its policy
of copy protection. I had Super Calc for a few years, but became a
Borland fan due to all the languages, Reflex, etc. (I'm sorry they're
finding it necessary to narrow down their focus to just a handful of
products - ASM, Pascal, C, Quattro, and one other, I forget which).
 Anyone else ordered it or gotten it? I particularly like the fact
that it behaves well without gobs of memory (will theoretically even
run in 512K) which is important to me because I have many TSRs etc.

Msg 42841 is 05 line(s) on 12/03/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: BORLAND

I suspect the "missing" product you're thinking of is Paradox. Seems that
they're also supporting Reflex, since they just released a new version.
All I can think of that they've dropped are Turbo Basic and Turbo Prolog;
I think the latter just isn't mass-market enough, and the former simply got
out-positioned by QB.

Msg 42842 is 03 line(s) on 12/04/89 from BARRY FUERST
to WARD CHRISTANSON re: WHAT ARE 'Z' FILES?

What are the files on the Advocate BBS that have a Z in the file type and what
do I need to unsqueese them? USQ.COM doesn't work. I left some messages
for you over there. Regards, Barry

Msg 42843 is 08 line(s) on 12/04/89 from ED FOSTER
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/QUATTRO-PRO

 Ward, I mailed my order for Quattro Pro last week. I have been using
Excel, but mainly because it will read dBASE and Lotus files and write
a tab-delimited text file. Excel is very capable, but even on a 386 it
is slower than 1-2-3 on an 8088, at least as far as panning around the
screen.
 What sold me on Quattro is its VROOM, however they spell it, that
allows working with a spreadsheet that won't fit entirely into RAM.
That will be impressive even if it's slow.

Msg 42844 is 10 line(s) on 12/04/89 from JAMES KARAGANIS
to ALAN LAYA re: UTILITIES

Alan,
 You might want to consider the ProBAS series of libraries from
Hammerly Associates. You can find their full page spread in Byte
and PC magazine. I understand they have considerable graphics support.
Their prices are quite reasonable too ($139.00 for the main library).
Originally, the package was called ADVBAS and was distributed as
shareware. Eventually it became fairly polished and is now sold
commercially.
 Thanks,
 Jim

Msg 42845 is 07 line(s) on 12/04/89 from BILL WOLFF
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/QUATTRO-PRO

I use both AS-EASY-AS and LOTUS V1.0A. Both does graphics and I have used
LOTUS 2.01 too. And the best deal I believe is AS-EASY-AS. It is fast and
works even in a 256K envirament (sp?). But since I have 640K on all my
computers, it doesn't matter much.

I have heard that QUATTRO-PRO is very good! But what does it offer that
others doesn't have? <BW>

Msg 42846 is 04 line(s) on 12/04/89 from BILL WOLFF
to ALL re: 4DOS AND DOS 4.0

Can anybody tell me about the shareware version of 4DOS?

Also can anybody tell me if DOS 4.0 is useful on a XT (V20) laptop? And
what features it has over DOS 3.3? <BW>

Msg 42847 is 08 line(s) on 12/04/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to BARRY FUERST re: R/WHAT ARE 'Z' FILES?

You need UNCR24 to decompress those files. They've been "crunched" which is
an LZW coding method similar to that used by ARC for MS-DOS machines.
P.S. BBS etiquette normally dictates that you ask such questions on the BBS
where the files were found. In particular, the Advocate has lots of CP/M
users, whereas my understanding is that Ward hasn't been into CP/M for quite
a few years. He may have invented the BBS concept, but that doesn't
obligate him to stay on top of each and every development involving BBS systems
(as if anybody could).

Msg 42849 is 04 line(s) on 12/05/89 from VERNE ARASE
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/QUATTRO-PRO

We ordered an evaluation copy of Quattro-Pro; I'll comment on it after
I've seen it. Hope you got it on the $99 offer; I'm a tad down on
Borland as they appear to be pulling out of all but the PC marketplace
(leaving licenced users on other platforms stranded).

Msg 42850 is 13 line(s) on 12/05/89 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to JIM ANDERSON re: R/PC-BASED UNIX OS

Thanks for the additional info, Jim. Sorry, but I'll have to pass-
can't afford it. BTW, are you a reseller? If so, I'd advise
checking out other vendors; there are some which are significantly
cheaper than SCO, and also more current. I'm looking at ESIX, a
UNIX System V/3.2 from an Everex subsidiary. The whole works, with
OS, development tools, and unltd user license. It lists for $825,
and they'll give me a 30% (!) discount if I 'trade up' from
Microport UNIX. The only hitch is that if you want the extended
doc.s you pay an additional $3. After the 30% discount, it still
comes to a total of about $930. The big issue is performance, and
comparison tests (at least those sent by ESIX, published in MIPS
mag.) show that it's quite competitive with other UNIX variants.
Check it out!
