to BRENT JONES re: R/PRODIGY WARNING

There apparently is a program (TSR, not TRS!) that will redirect to
disk.  I've yet to actually find it, since Prodigy lacks file xfer...
I'm surprised people haven't thought of putting hex in messages that
they could un-hex into an arc file or something ;-)
  Last night I nearly powered off in the middle of a Prodigy session.
  I feel its user interface for the EXPERIENCED user (or the novice
user the tenth time) is really, well, lets see, to avoid my own censorship,
I'll just say "chicken excrement" ;-)
  I think the time will come when I feel I can't take it any more.
  Example.  to send a msg, there's no simple "get out of message entry
key".  OK, you hit "end" and then have to cursor over to "save", at{which
time it - treating you like the worlds stupidest person - says "you asked
to save, do you want to" (essentially), then the accursed thing tells you
how to get back to the original msg (instead of TAKING YOU THERE).  I've
started typing <enter><enter><enter> but the @#$% prodigy throws away
buffered keystrokes.  Chicken excrement! I think I'll just reply to all
my msgs "sorry, I can't take this any more, I'm leaving, probably won't
be back ever".

Hi Jim;

Hmm... You reply about Prodigy is interesting! But it still
sounds like the software is the same as PC-LINK or Q-LINK in
nature. Both cost $9.95 a month and some features are free too.
But you did state that all Prodigy features are fr{e. But lacks
file directories. Sounds like all other national networks have
Prodigy on that one. Having local phone numbers doesn't sound
like news to me? CIS has one of the best coverage I have seen.
Perhaps you know that and still say Prodigy has a lot more.

You did mention some features that other national networks lack,
but then you stated that they are also not available in this
area? So lets see, we have a flat $9.95 monthly charge which is
nice and better software than Q-LINK or PC-LINK are which is also
a big plus. But the other features sounds like no major gain
kOotherwise. Perhaps I am missing something!

Also I need to know what Prodigy needs to run on? Will a Sharp
Laptop with 256K be okay? It will be expanded to 640K, but I am
just asking.

to ALL re: DIFF BETWEEN LPT1 AND LPT1:

In a previous entry (about 20 messages ago) I ran across a discussion
of the differences between lpt1: and lpt1  in relation to a network.
This has been on my mind lately.  I thought all device names in MS-DOS
included a colon --  com1: prn: lpt1: A: C: etc.  Yet I have a shell
program (Polytron PolyShell) that won't send a file to the printer if
I call it prn:  but WILL if I call it prn     Is the shell brain dead,
or am I?  Is there a difference?  DOS itself doesn't seem to care
either way, oddly enough.  I really think it should!  Could someone
set me straight on this trivial (albeit puzzling) detail?

to MARTY DIPPEL re: R/DIFF BETWEEN LPT1 AND LPT1:

I thought in the beginning that you had to use the ":" at the end of
a device name too. But I have since found out like you that sometimes
it doesn't matter. To write a short ASCII file for .BAT file or something.
I use "COPY CON FILENAME.EXT" and it works everytime.

Perhaps we get this idea from using CP/M computers as if I remember right,
you have to use the ":" or the DOS treats it as a file instead of a device.
I am assuming that you have used CP/M computers before!

Bill, I think you're right. we may not be talking aboutsame thing
GEOS to me is from Berkley softworks and runs on Apple II and C-64/128
hardware. your mention of Wordstar tells me your talking about a different
product that runs on PC's

The book indicates that you need 512K RAM.. By local numbers, I mean
REALLY local.  In order to call Compuserve, Delphi, PC-Link, I have
to call out of my 8 mile radius and rack up the phone bill.  I can
stay on Prodigy as long as I want/need.f*

No that's the one from Berkeley Softworks. And they are working on a
MS-DOS version. Look for it!
