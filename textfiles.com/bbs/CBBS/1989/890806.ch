OK, I'll do 'ya one better - take a look myself and see what I can
see. One big problem I see is that text is "bunched" by articles,
headlines, etc - and they don't have to be in any particular order,
I'd say. You have your work cut out for you. I'll hack it a bit
nonight before I hit the sack.

CBBS normally runs a 9600 HST modem. Without HST, you couldn't go
9600. I believe MNP should be the same at 2400, however - my 9600 does
OK calling into Compuserve MNP. Not sure what level of handshaking
happens, but I never get any errors - only LONG delays if the line is
REALLY bad, then I call back.
 Setup strings? When calling in MNP, I just do: AT&M4&K0&B2

Gee, you didn't feel like doing like me - spending $159 (?) for a
"Turbo Cool"?
 My hard disk also is too hot - so I went the Turbo Cool route. I had
gone the external fan route before - a fan blowing in the front by the
grill, and another sucking out the back where the exhaust goes - and
after a while, I just got tired of the noise. When I upgraded, I finally
just went for a "Silencer" which runs a bit cooler, and a LOT quieter,
but now my Priam half height just is too hot, so Turbo Cool, here I come.
 It just arrived today. Will put it in, maybe tomorrow. Good to have
a heat wave to get me going on it.

Hi, Flip.

Msg 42229 is 07 line(s) on 08/04/89 from ED FOSTER
to GARY ELFRING re: R/UPGRADE[

 You have abouti] 9% response so far. 1% is good for a cold mailing,
and 9% beats what I have seen personally.
 Why did you go with Perfect binding? Is the manual too big for
saddle stitching? If so, how about spiral? My objection is that
a perfect-bound manual does not lay flat. Even the big Borland
and Microsoft manuals don't lay flat, but you can soften the spine
eventually. I still like ring binders for a manual that will get used.

 How does the PC-Help hotline work? I gather from the 900 prefix
that charges are billed directly to the phone. What sorts of problem
can the caller expect to get fixed?

Thanx! Looking forward to 'em. When ready, should I pick 'em up here, or
would you prefer direct xfer to keep the board free?

Msg 42232 is 07 line(s) on 08/05/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/2ND FAN

When you have a nice looking NEW computer I guess you want it to
look good. This XT is just a workhorase for me so a fan sticking
out on the side is OK. It isn't a regular computer fan so only has a
 slight hum. Sounds like a HD when starting up with it's
humming but is quite acceptable. Right now extra money will probably go
for a new computer (unless I decide to get more software as before
and blow the idea).

Know anything about IBM S/36's??

Msg 42234 is 16 line(s) on 08/05/89 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to ED FOSTER re: R/SOFTWARE UPGRADES

I think the reason many people don't bother with fixes is that, like
me, they haven't run across the particular bugs that have been fixed
and/or don't want the hassle of reinstalling! Some probably aren't
using the software also, but this is probably a minority.
 By the way, I got the Spear system, which is really an Everex
STEP 386/25. It's very nice, but unfortunately, I haven't been
able to get the SCSI harddisk to run-the word from Everex is that
the Seagate ST-02 HD/FD controller is not compatible with their
AMI BIOS. So Spear is expressing me a new Future Domain 16-bit
SCSI controller (ST-02 is only 8-bit!) which should solve the
problem. I highly recommend Spear, partly because they sell
renamed Everex equipment, and partly because of their excellent
support policies and personnel. Their support line is open saturdays
and their techies are very responsive, quick and knowledgeable.
They've even offered to but the ST-02 back from me if Hard Drives
International won't! Well, so long for now.wish me luck!

Msg 42236 is 06 line(s) on 08/06/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to COLIN SCHROEDER re: R/SOFTWARE UPGRADES

I've had good experiences with Spear as well; ordered a 386-20 (not Step)
from the in January and it's worked fine. There have been times when
they've delivered DOA equipment, but they've always resolved it quickly.
They might not be the greatest place for a total computer illiterate
to order from, but if you know what you're doing they provide very
good value.
