Msg 42348 is 09 line(s) on 08/22/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL MIDIOTS re: MIDI? ANYONE?

I've got an OLD midi setup ('85) but have just bought new software -
Voyetra's Sequencer Plus Mk 3.
 It is VEYR nice software.
 Any other "MIDIots" out there?
 One of the more interesting things I'm doing with it is to "key in"
sheet music, for "tunes" I don't know (some Dixieland jazz). From the
computer and synthesizer, I then learn the "rhythm" and feel of the tune,
and can begin to "follow along" in the sheet music, and eventually play
along, starting with a slower tempo, etc.

to ALL re: MODEM CODES

I have a Practical Peripherals 2400 baud modem and I misplaced the
manual for it. It is a Hayes compatible device and I would like
to change the DTR setting so I can disconnect from the software
and not have to turn off the modem when I want to leave a network
such as CIS. Does anyone know how to change the DTR setting?

a Novell SFT 2.15 Netware with a Seagate 250R hard drive using the
ST11/R controller. The computer is a XT-compatible with a 286 turbo
card, so we can't switch to any other controller. We have tried to use
Ontrack's Disk Manager-N to modify the Novell defaults, but
have been unsuccessful. From conversations with various tech support
people, we have deduced that we require some sort of driver to allow
Netware to recognize the 8-bit controller card. Have any of you heard
of such an animal? ANY help would be appreciated.

I believe your problem is that the Practical Peripheral Modems default
to having DTR or CD ON all the time. I think that the parameter is the
&Cx command. I just checked, and my initialization string for the non-
MNP features of my PP 2400 is ATE1M0X4V1S7=60S11=55&C1&D2. I'm pretty sure t
{that the &C1 is what makes DTR follow CD instead or just remaining HIgh
at all times. I just found found the manual{.(darn
line noise) &C1 is what you want. makes the DCD signal follow
the state of the distant modem's carrier, rather than just staying on.
You can (after you get the setup the way you like it) write the changes
to nonvolatile RAM by using an AT&Wx command, where x is 0 or 1. You can set
the powerup confguration by using AT&Yx, where x is the same number
that you used with the AT&Wx command. Hope this helps

I've seen that kind of problem a couple of times. It can have various
causes and can be hard to pin down. (Use of a good HD and controller
diagnostic program helps!) I have a HD on a machine which sometimes is
<<very>> slow in powering up-so slow the rest of machine, like yours,
assumes the HD isn't available and so looks to the floppy. With that (old)
machine, I simply keep a disk in the floppy at start-up, let things settle
in for a minute or so, then remove the floppy and press RESET. That's
consistently worked fine for about a year.A common source of problem,
I've been told by a HD tech, is that the bearing which you generally can
visibly see on most HDs that acts somewhat like a clutch is simply dirty,
so the drive doesn't always engage. Generally, for awhile this is more a
nuisance than a problem, as the normal heat and vibration during start-up
can be enough to dislodge it. But of course a fix is eventually needed. (He
advised judicious use of a clean eraser-being <<sure>> to remove all
traces of the erasure residue when done.) On the other hand, it could be
a serious HD or controller problem, which is where the diagnostic programs
really shine. Hope this helps.

My understanding is some programs will use extended memory like Lotus
and MicroSoft stuff. Like you can use the extra RAM as a RAMDISK. I like
RAMDISK a lot. Also you can use the memory as a cauge (sp?) to save your
disk drives from wear, handy!

If yor program doesn't support it, then it won't work. But their are
utilities out there to help you get the most out of it.

 I see that you were struggling with the 'find' command.
Syntax is:
 find firstname lastname<cr>
 The spelling must be EXACTLY as the caller being 'found'
spells it. EXACTLY. It's not case sensitive, however.
 I ran it on the person you were seeking, and he last called
08/22/89 @16:06 #42346.
 The '#42346' business is the high message number at his
last call.
 Try the command again. I see you appeared to be appending
a comma after the last name. DON'T do that.

Msg 42368 is 08 line(s) on 08/26/89 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to RICHARD HINTON re: R/EXTENDED MEMORY??

On your machine, you can use a program like DESQview, which can
actually run multiple programs simultaneously. It's a shell
which runs under DOS, and splits up memory between "windows".
I think the 286 (AT) version uses extended memory like standard
dos memory (I know the 386 version does). So essentially what
you're doing is running each program in its own chunk of RAM!
Check into it before buying, however, to verify what I've said
here!

HELP! I've just bought VM/386, a multitasking program from IGC.
If anyone out there has it also, I'd be interested to hear from
you. My basic problems are that I'm trying to configure it to
use 2 video cards/monitors, one VGA and one Hercules. According
to documentation, I should be able to link WordPerfect exclusively
to the virtual machine running it, and simultaneously run progs
on the VGA monitor. But, when WP starts up, it scrambles the VGA,
writing a bunch of high ascii characters in various colors, flashing.
I've also run into a variety of types of screen corruption when
running the VGA-linked virtual machines.
 Does anyone have any ideas?
