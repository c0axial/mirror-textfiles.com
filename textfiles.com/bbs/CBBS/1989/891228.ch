to ALL re: MEX114 HELP

It's bugging me:  I'm using a version of MEX114 for my Osborne 1
and for some reason it never recognizes when tn there's a connection.
It just sits there saying it's trying the number, eventually it
usually says that it didn't connect.  But if I go to terminal mode
then, I'm connected.  Any CP
/M MEX users out there got any ideas?

Msg 42943 is 11 line(s) on 12/25/89 from BILL WOLFF
to BENJAMIN COHEN re: R/MEX114 HELP

Hmm... the software doesn't detect a carrier detect. Using many computers
and modems over the years and many Cp/M programs. It sounds like to me
that you have your DTR signal control set wrong on your modem. Also
some modems (Hayes compatible) expects the opposite logic for inter-
pretation. In fact, all of my non-Hayes are this way. But my real-Hayes
are the exact opposite. I hope this helps. If not, I'll play more around
with my MEX and see what happens. On my Commodore 128, I have a switch
to toggle the logic to fix the problem. But I do recall that same problem
you mentioned on my Osborne running CrossTalk and a non-Hayes modem.

Let me know what you find? <BW>

Msg 42945 is 24 line(s) on 12/25/89 from BILL WOLFF
to ALL re: PRODIGY VS. Q-LINK

I have been using Prodigy for three months now. And I remember saying
that Prodigy is very much like Q-Link. Someone told me that it isn't
like Q-Link or PC-Link. Well after all this time, I admit there are
differences, but most services are the same.

They both cost $9.95 a month. But Q-Link/PC-Link can run into more
using more than an hour of Plus Time services (file section, message
bases, etc.). Both I get the lastest news information and weather
reports. Both offer me E-Mail service around the country. Although
Q-Link only offers up to 1200 baud, it is still faster than Prodigy at
2400 baud. The reason for this is because Q-Link uses the character
set to make graphics. Much like ANSI boards. Q-Link allows you to save
your information to disk, but Prodigy offers  very little information
to be saved. Mostly E-Mail to printer only.

Even though Prodigy claims it is the easiest to get around. Q-Link
works by just knowing four function keys (select, save, cancel, and
help functions). I have had people on-line faster than I have had on
Prodigy.

Q-Link offers many more bulletin boards and 25,000 downloadable file
support. The only things that Prodigy has that Q-Link doesn't is a
better graphic screen (which slows the whole thing like working in 300
baud) and commercials! So take your pick! <BW>

in the WP echo, but it looks as if that msg. was dumped--I'll post
a request there later.  BTW, that BBS is a great concept--though I
don't have any serious handicaps, I know if I did I'd certainly

Q-Link
I have been very disappointed in Prodigy. The pace is brutally
slow. I feel like I'm back in the PMMI 300 baud days. And there
is no expert mode to speed things up.  Sears/IBM should just have
bought space on CServe or choggied up $50 for a copy of Ward/Randy's
instead of spending all that money to develop a model T.
  So how do I get in touch with Q\Link,for a demo?

Yes I agree with you about Prodigy! I do admit though, some people
will like it. Maybe those who can't handle this board for example.

About Q-Link! Do you know it only runs on Commodore systems? Kind of
like Prodigy only runs on IBM's and now MAC's. But Q-Link does have a
IBM counterpart called PC-Link. I haven't seen it in action, but it
is suppose to be about the same as Q-Link.

I may have gotten a once in a lifetime deal with Q-Link. About 13 months
ago they offered a $169 one time fee and have access for life. I had taken
them up on it and never regreted that move. I did think they would do it
again. But so far, it seemed to be the first and only shot at it. But
things worked well for me. But I wish more could of joined in! <BW>

to WARD/ALL re: COPY FILE1+FILE2

The DOS manual says that any multi-file copy defaults to an
ascii file transfer.  This means that each copied file is assumed to end
with the character before its ctl-z (if any), and that a ctl-z
is put at the new file's end.  To remove the final ctl-z from any text
file, here's the simplest approach:   TYPE   oldfile.txt >newfile.txt

to ALL re: QUESTION ABOUT NON-AT'S

On the AT, there is one command that sets NUMLOCK on, and there
is another command that sets the NUMLOCK LED on.  The latter
command is an OUT command to port 60.  The question is, Does
any PC-compatible machine use this port for some other purpose,
or can you just issue that LED-on command with impunity on
any PC-compatible?
.
Or is there a way of determining through software alone that
your computer is using an AT-type keyboard?

to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/QUESTION ABOUT NON-AT'S

All IBM compatibles use port 60H for interface to the keyboard.  It's
actually a serial port (though not a typical async port).  I don't
know how an XT-type keyboard would respond to the specific command
byte for setting the LED, but my guess would be that it would be ignored.
If you want to test for an enhanced AT keyboard, you can use subfunction
5 of int 16h to write an FFFFh to the keyboard buffer (this function
will work only on ATs with enhanced keyboards.  Then use subfunction
10h to try to read the FFFF back; if you don't get it within 16 tries,
you don't have an enhanced keyboard.

Brent, Sorry for the long delay,  I haven't looked into PC Outline as of yet
I'll look for it and try it out.  So far Qedit seems to fit the bill.  I'm
still testing it out and haven't had enough use of it to decide.  Is PC Outline
on any of the boards you know of?    - -  Mike  - -

I saw a msg from Ward Christensen to Frank Spivey about Linpack.
Linpack is available from Argonne National Lab or IMSL in Houston.
Jack Dongarra ( one of the developers) has moved to Oakridge National
Lab in Tenn. He was the main reason the distribution was out of
Argonne.  You should be able to call Argonne (972-2000) and ask for
the National Software Distribution center.  Or call IMSL at (713-772-1927).

I left a msg to Ward Christensen about linpack (msg 42961).  I didn't
know where your msg was at the time.  If you're looking for code in
C, linpack is not where you what to look.  Linpack is ALL fortran.
It's still the most portable thing the people at Argonne can get their
hands on.

I was recently in Rochester New York on a business trip and saw an RBBS
up there with a series of programs on the board for downloads.  It
included routines to screen dumps, send to disk and a few other nice
options.  I however; did not have the credits nor the time to download
them.  Maybe someone ehas seen some of these program add ons on
another board.  I would appreaciate the help.  Meanwhile; I'm  going
to try contacting some people I meet on Prodigy up there and see if
I can have someone send them to the area.

I had that problem long ago. Seems to me that I worked around it by
adding an ATZ command either to the disconnect string, or (I believe)
at the head of the dial-out string.
