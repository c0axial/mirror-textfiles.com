Msg. 42344 is from Jim mills and he was really into CP/M. That might be
a good place to start.

to JIM SACKETT re: R/MIXED FEELINGS PRODIGY

Interesting that the bulletin board stuff was apparently an add-on
(and to me is VERY VERY frustrating - you send, then it says "you pressed
send, did you mean to?". I find myself swearing at Prodigy for its
inability to just let you do something, instead treating you like a
novice every step of the way. I don't mind a helping hand now and then,
but seriously, when receiving a msg and replying, can't it do SOMETHING
better than put you BACK in msg edit on the msg you created? I figured
I'd done something wrong, and did the send function, wound up back in
message edit AGAIN, finally figured it was just pretty bad software.
As if that wasn't bad enuf, the guy I was replying to said "I received
most of your msgs twice, why?" heh heh.
 They need a new logo. "Prodigy. The system you love to hate".
 As to being still online, one morning reading my mail, I got SO frustrated
that I just ctrl-alt-del'd it, then was up taking a shower when I said
"you know, I'll bet it never hung up". Sure enough, it was still here
on the phone line. Sigh.

Msg 42756 is 08 line(s) on 11/13/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to BARRY FUERST re: R/CP/M BBS S

Type the following exactly: or;1,mills bbs
this will retrieve a msg from Jim Mills about his BBS which was a CP/M
bbs for a long time. Like many it is now on a PC, but that would be a
good place to start anyway. I checked, Jim hasn't called in HERE since
September, so best to go try his board directly.
 P.S. or means One line summary with Retrieve, then ; says enter the
next answer in advance, and "1,mills bbs" says to do a search starting with
msg 1, but keyword searching mills and bbs.

Msg 42757 is 06 line(s) on 11/13/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to BARRY FUERST re: R/CP/M BBS S

Oops. I goofed. or;1,mills bbs would find only the phrase "mills bbs"
but in fact it is mills BROTHERS bbs. Instead do this, to find it
exactly:
 or;1,f=mills & s=bbs
(From = mills, Subject = BBS)
 Sorry.

I suspect that MEX (one of the best CP/M PD telecommunications programs)
has overlays for your hardware. If interested, you can call a BBS I run
(still operating on a CP/M system) to check. Exit the message base, then
type GO MODEM. Once there, you'll either need to look for overlays which
"look like" your computer, terminal and modem, or check the "basic MEX
library" (name escapes me, but should be obvious). That library contains
everything <except> hardware-specific files; it also contains a list of
all hardware-specific overlays and the equipment for which they're written.
With that list, you should be able to determine exactly which of the scores
of overlay files you'll need. (Type HELP for further info.) Good luck.

 >>> Ye Olde Archive Electron Mail Service Bulletin Board System<<<
 "Chicago's FIRST P.C. Board >< User Supported Since 1985"
is
proud
to announce:
 A major Upgrade! To P.C. Board Version 14.2
As most Chicago BBS users may already know, Ye Olde Archive has been a
Leader in providing comprehensive file, message and bulletin services.
We began supporting P.C. Board and the .ARC format in 1986 and have been
loyal to these two institutions ever since, hoping that in the IBM-PC-AT
shifting landscape we could provide a landmark of constancy for our users.
 SO:
It is with great deliberation and planning that we announce a Major-type
Upgrade to P.C. Board V.14.2 and the adoption of PKZIP 1.02.
Long-time users know that John "Dr. Byte" Rosengarten does not change BBS
software lightly and that file compression techniques come and go with the
tides. BUT!
 There comes a time when a New Standard must be adopted. or we go the
way of the dinosaur and the IBM 370 mainframe into oblivion.
 Therefore!
Ye Olde Archive Electron Mail Service BBS hereby upgrades to the latest
version of P.C. Board and formally adopts the PKZIP file compression
method.

 I shouldn't really put myself on the spot, but I work for Ma Bell. The
noise could be attributed to many things. It could be due to bad grounding
(as someone else said) on your equipment. Or it could be due to our equiip-
ment (but that never happens!?!). Maybe I could help if you can tell me
what the noise was like. Was it a tone, clicking, crosstalk, buzzing, or
something else? I am no expert, but advice is free.
 If it happens in the meantime, contact your Service Representative
(number's in the front of your phone book) as SOON as it happens. A lot
of times the trouble comes and goes, so you have to catch it right away.
 Good luck.

The error you are getting is basically in two parts.
The 4056 is an error in the memory bank, with each digit in the
4056 telling you the exact location where the chip is not functioning,
while the 301 error indicates an error in the key-board. Referring
to the manual will pin-point the exact location of the bad memory
chip.

 To find any/all messages to/from you, do:

 You may then kill ALL messages that you have left (selectively),
even those you have "passworded" and have forgotten that password.
 Messages TO you may also be killed, provided the sender did NOT
"password" the msgs themselves. You will not be able to kill those,
but when try to do so, a note will be left for myself (and fellow
operators) in the log, that you wish it erased.
 Use a bit of caution here, okay?
 I mention caution since in-advertant ATTEMPTS to erase msgs
OTHER than to/from you might subject you to an extensive
"grilling" regarding your actions (Ve haff vays to make you talk!).

SCO is one of the most respected companies for PC based Unix. I suggest
talking to them. They advertise in the Unix magazines I'm quite sure,
and probably in other mags (as I've seen the ads, but don't recall where).
 The name is "Santa Cruz Operation" so I assume that is their home base,
a call to information there should yield a number.
 Alternatively you might want to talk to Randy Suess who just moved his
10-user Unix from an aging 3B2 to a 386.

If you want REAL OLD and REAL CHEAP and don't need PC hi-bit char set,
I have an old Gemini 10-X that a friend who borrowed it is bringing back.
 Its drawbacks are that it uses "spool" ribbons, etc. I don't have it
yet, but when I get it back it would definitely be <$100, about as cheap
as you can find a printer.

Anyone considering PC Outline should abandon Brown Bag (they tried to sue
the author to keep him from producing a competitor). John Friend, the
author, went on to create a VERY strong competitor, called GrandView. I
just bought it - and it is very nice, albeit costing about $200.

Just got back from a week at Comdex. Wow. My feet are tired!
 Needless to say (so here I say it) everyone who would go would be looking
for something different, so my interests won't match others.
 For the person wanting to outfit their own machine, it was either heaven
or hell - the latter if you feel just innundated by board after replacement
board for your XT or AT or to build a new Tower System. Everything from
$225 SX-286s, to the many machines showing off their Landmark Benchmarks,
which puts up a bar graph corresponding to the equivalent AT Mhz speed -
with something in the ONE HUNDRED TWENTIES being the fastest I saw - for
I think a 33MHz 486.
 I enjoyed seeing all the slick 300 DPI wax transfer color printers, and
the "Dye transfer" printers that produce photographic quality.
 The new HP IIP was nice - but many people have seen 'em because they are
selling so well.
 Probably the single most striking thing was the beautiful color display
I saw on an IBM P70 120M 20MHz 386 portable.
 I enjoyed the various small laptops. The Atari Folio (?) had a childish
8 x 40 display and sidestepped MS-DOS compatability issues; also had Ctrl
in the "wrong" place (not left of A) so even if it WERE compatible I wouldn't
want it; the Poqet, being shown in the Fujitsu booth, looked VERY nice -
runs 100 hours on 2 AA batteries - less than 1c/hr. Screen was quite tiny
(though large for the size of the machine - couldn't BE larger) with full
80 x 25, 640 x 200 graphics. Slide-in RAM cards, and a lap-link type product
made this very interesting - and only the $2K price had me saying "interesting
but not for me".
 Toshiba's new T1000SE looked very nice - white case (I prefer something
darker) but everything "2x" what it is in the T1000 - 1M vs 512K, 400 line
vs 200 line display, 1.44M diskette vs 720, 9.6MHz vs 4.77. Big drawback
was the very strikingly readable screen - brings batt life down to 2+ hrs.
 Blew $80 on the "Slots" but made $205, so that was enjoyable too! ;-)
