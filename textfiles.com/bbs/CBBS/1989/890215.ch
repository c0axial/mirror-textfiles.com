Bob, my age is showing. I just ran across the message from you about T.I.C.
The Apple shareware telecomm. program. Did I mail you one. If not, a
are you going to be at Barnabies Sat. If so, I can bring the,program
on Sat.
Please advise

to BOB SULLIVAN re: R/VIRUS PROBLEM SOLVED?

While you say that with a interrupt vector, a virus may hide itself within
a Commodore. This is true in theory. And the fact that Commodore leaves
itself open to just about any modification would even make this task sound
even easier. It's also a plus for programmers too. But being a programer
and a user of Commodore computers for many years the truth is that about
95 percent of programs always modify that vector and would stop the virus
dead. Just keeping a ML program safe when loading another unknown program
usually kills the hidden program ML program. This makes it tough to even
come up with a RAMDOS utility (a modified DOS for RAMDISK) to work with
other unknown programs. Most Commodore programs modify the operating
system for it's own needs. I am always patching programs just to leave
other programs alone. What a mess!

But on the other side, GEOS (graphic environment operating system) for the
Commodore gives a MAC like environment that does the exact opposite. It's
geared to work with other programs in memory and will be ideal for a virus
to come it's way. Fortunately I have not heard of one yet. I guess it
would be just a matter of time though! I enjoyed your comment very much. I
like being shown things I did not think of, because I always learn!

Suggest you consider the hyperbola as model for your 'trigger'
on the 31st day of the monthur message indicates you are
looking at an exponential curve. The hyperbola can yield a much
'sharper knee' and steeper rise of the curve {oward the awE&SAbXo
LOTS OF NOISE Ttoward the asymptote (which is what
want). The equation you want is this:
 (x-h)(y-k)=(-a2/2) read 'a2' as a squared.
 The center of the hyperbola is at h,k and the asymptotes
 are parallel to the x- and y-axes.
Run a few plots of this to model it to your needs, and I think
you will get better results. Note that you are only interested in
half of the hyperbola. Let me know if this is any help. Regards.

 Job Wanted
I am seeking a job as a computer programmer or operator an an IBM-PC
XT/AT environment. I have had experience in C, Quick Basic, and in
developing MS-Windows Applications. I've worked on an IBM AT compatable
on a Novell network and on a VAX-11/750. If anyone knows of any such
positions open, please let me know by calling 422-0526.
I possess a Bachelor's degree from St. Xavier College and have
excellent references. I have been working with personal computers since
1980.
 Thanks,
 Jim Polous

to BILL WOLFF re: R/VIRUS PROBLEM SOLVED?

Good point, if the vector is the only vulnerable point of entry then
it sure would be easy to double check it.
 I haven't used Commodores for about six years and obviously was speaking
about ancient programs. Yeah ROMS do provide good protection. How about
battery backed RAMS which need an external switch for reprogramming, thus
a virus couldn't sneak in without permission. At the same time you could
reprogram the OS when needed. Not foolproof but it could provide some extra
protection in certain situations.

Please let me know how I can reciprocate. Thanks.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: KILLING MESSAGES

How exactly do I go about killing messages (to me) that I've aleady
read? Do I have to know a password set by the sender? Also, am I
correct in assuming all messages are "public" in the sense that anyone
can read them? ie, "WHO TO" is just to flag the message so it will
be noticed by the one to whom it is sent. Thanks.
