to DAVID GIBBS re: R/2400 & MNP

Not weird. New MNP modem on CBBS, but CBBS isn't updatet to handle
it yet. Sorry. I should have Randy issue a AT&M0&W command to turn off
the MNP.

Msg 41412 is 02 line(s) on 02/26/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JOHN WHITE re: R/BBS'S IN INDY?

Computer Shopper magazine has a national BBS listing. You can find
it at Krochs and other book stores.

Msg 41413 is 16 line(s) on 02/27/89 from JERRY OLSEN
to JOHN WHITE re: R/BBS'S IN INDY?

I can't offer any specific phone numbers (sorry), but one approach
would be to give a call over to a board (in Chicago) which I and
others run which contains several BBS lists, some national. If you
go the operating system from the message base ("C" command), then
type SEARCH, select the "BBS lists" option. In response to the
first "Search for?" query, enter "Indianapolis." Skip any "And?"
prompts. In response to the first "Or?" prompt, enter the area code
for Indianapolis. (Some lists include cities, some include area codes,
most both-this catches 'em all.)

Other than that, perhaps one of several Hoosiers calling here or over
my way can get you started. Thereafter, a message on your first Indy
board probably will yield several leads.

Good luck.Contact info:

Have a mint condition Toshiba laptop - T1000 - for sale.
Also, I have the companion 5.25" external optional disk drive.
Best offer - call Joe Jesson at 356-6817 eve or{356-3645 days.

Msg 41415 is 09 line(s) on 02/28/89 from ED FOSTER
to ANDY SHAPIRO re: 10NET & PARADOX

 Sorry for jumping in so late, but I was out of town without
a modem. After seeing your message I checked my most recent
10NET compatibility list for Paradox, and it says that it will
work. There is a moderately complicated procedure for installing
it on the superstation, about 150 lines long.
 Are you aware that 10NET has a BBS at 513-433-5080? It is
multiuser and available 24 hours. You don't have to be a user
or VAR to use the BBS, and I have found it helpful. If you don't
want to call Dayton, I will be happy to send you a disk.
