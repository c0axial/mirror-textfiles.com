Actually, a trip to he Smithsonian for Randy & I think IS being

My favorite PC horror story is the "semi-knowledgable" user who creates
their own directory, uses it, then erases the files in it, but when
they do a DIR they see "." and "..".  So they try to erase 'em.
  Quiz: what happens the next time the system is powered on?
  What's YOUR favorite PC horror story?
  Randy's is the person who, when asked to "remove the diskette from the
protective jacket..."  Need I say more?

Thanks for the advice, Tom.  I've solved my problem by very simple means
(embarrassing, really) but the subject has caught my interest; I've been
reading about the environment and dissecting applicable programs to
tailor its use.  I think I've got it down fairly well now, thanks to all
the help I've received on CBBS.  Again, thanks.

Msg 41624 is 23 line(s) on 04/01/89 from FRANK SPIVEY II
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: BBS COMMUNICATIONS

Greetings Ward!  It came to my attention that your quite a celebrity as
far as computer communications are concerned.  I am planning to start
a bulletin board of my own within the next two months.  In my preparation
stage, I acquired a book to aid me in my understanding of telecommunication
As I read through the book, "The First Primer of Microcomputer Tele-
communications", I came across your name and the mention of CBBS.
Wow! How does it feel to be immortal! Just Kidding!
     I have a few questions about the setup of a bulletin board. First
of all, I have a copy of RBBS PC ver 16.1A.  Right now it is in archived
form, but I am about to buy a hard drive and place in on the HD.  One
question is, how easy is it to configure a bulletin board.  I read
in oe shareware catalog that it would take me approximately one day to
have it up and running.  Since you and Randy are the "sole" pioneers in
the field, is this the case, and is it very demanding to constantly
maintain the bulletin board?  Secondly, I am planning to purchase the
evermore cheaply priced SMG 2400 modem from Elektek.  Is this a quality
piece of hardware to depend on, or should I go for the more reknown
brands like US robotics?  Lastly, How is it possible to accept more than
one call at a time,(I haven't finished the book yet)?  I have a vague
concept of partitioning the hard drive to support multiple callers, but
I am only starting out with a 30 meg HD. For now I plan to keep it
simple, but one day, I hope to have been blessed by the same fortune
as yourself,ie.(knowledge).  Thank you for your help.

to ALL re: BASIC TO COMPILED BASIC?

I have a program written in GW-BASIC and I want to change it into
a compiled BASIC so that all you need is to type the program name
and you don't need the BASIC interpreter anymore. Anyone have
an idea of a good BASIC compiler that will make the conversion?

Msg 41626 is 12 line(s) on 04/01/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to RICHARD HINTON re: R/BASIC TO COMPILED BASIC?

The two leading basic compilers are Quick Basic, and Turbo Basic.  I like
the latter, many like the former.
  Since both GWBasic and Quick Basic are from Microsoft, you will probably
have the best compatability by going with Quick Basic.
  I particularly like Turbo Basic because its editor can be customized,
and has a word-star-like editor interface, while Quick Basic earns good points
by doing syntax checking as you type the program.
  I was very impressed with the graphics capabilities of Turbo Basic, but
then I've also seen some excellent "graphics programs" that I later found
had been written in Quick Basic, so I guess they both sound pretty good.
  In other words, there's probably NOT a big difference between them enough
to clearly eliminate either from your decision process.

to FRANK SPIVEY II re: R/BBS COMMUNICATIONS

  Q. How long does it take to customize RBBS and get it going?
  A: I have no idea, having never seen it.  CBBS is written in assembler
and is of more "historical" significance, than current relevance.
  Q: How demanding is it to maintain a BBS?
  A: "it depends".  CBBS is a (rare) message-only system, so by having several
"assistant operators" who have the power to kill any invalid message, the
time isn't too bad.  If CBBS were a download board (therefore with uploads)
then things get a lot more complex - both from the simple "accounting"
standpoint of keeping space on the disk, but also from the "quality"
aspects - ranging from the task of ensuring that files are appropriately
named, and the descriptions are appropriate, to cataloging things so
callers can readily find what they want, to the responsibility of ensuring
no viruses are passed along by your system, or worse, invade your system.
  Q: How do I handle more than one caller at a time.
  A: Start with a multi-user operating system, like Unix, or a dedicated
bulletin board system that does the multi-tasking and multi-user duties
within itself.  RBBS and DOS are a single user BBS operating on a single
user operating system, and are a place to start, but not for multi-user.
  Perhaps your book will tell you about multi-user.  I'm more familiar
with what Randy has done - put up a multi-user conferencing system on
a Unix base (an AT&T 3B2) than with the multi-user systems based upon
80x86 architecture.
  Another way to handle multiple users is to have multiple systems,
with a LAN, sharing a single server's large hard disk.  This is the
technique used by the really nice and famous Gene Plantz system here
in the Chicago area.
  Hope this gives you "some" ideas.  Sorry I'm not a BBS Maven, but more
of a pioneer who has done a lot of other things too.  For example, I am
now a Sysop on Compuserve (76703,302) and that takes a couple hours a day.

With Qbasic V4.5 you don't even have to look at the manual. The online
help is COMPLETE. The easiest "program" I have run.

What kind of price are we talking and must the file server be dedicated as
a file server?

Msg 41630 is 07 line(s) on 04/01/89 from DAN SEIBOLD
to ALL re: HELP WITH SWAPPING BOARDS

I have the chance to buy a exas Instruments PC that is presently
running MS-DOS 2.11. The Kernal however is TI specific and is not
capable of running anything that is not written just for that machine.
  Question: How successful would I be if I bought an 8088 motherboard
and replaced the one in the TI with that? Do the power supply plugs
match? Would that solve my kernal problems? Any input would be
appreciated.

Msg 41631 is 06 line(s) on 04/01/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to FRANK SPIVEY II re: R/BBS COMMUNICATIONS

Some BBS programs (OPUS, for one) are capable of running under multitaskers
like DoubleDOS or DesqView and, with some restrictions, can be used to
service multiple lines.  Others, like some of the more expensive versions
of TBBS, contain internal multitasking that lets them handle several lines;
the disadvantage here is that you can't do anything that involves calling
external programs.
