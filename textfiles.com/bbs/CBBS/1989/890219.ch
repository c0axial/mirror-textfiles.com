Yep, you've got it exactly. If passworded you need to know it to K.
 Yes, all msgs are public. If this were a multi-user system, then I could
see having private msgs, but being single-phone-line, I feel private msgs

Yep, the steep curve of the hyperbola is also appropriate -
Isn't the hyperbola basycally xy=1? In other words, simplified this
way, isn't x=1/y? My formula, x=10/(31-y) is in fact the same thing,
with offset axes and scale, right?

A. I can use the cardboards. Call me at 726-3555. I mail out stuff in
large envelopes (lots of documentation) with a disk or two.

B. I've been using a disk mailer/carton that folds from a flat piece of
cardboard into a box with FOUR layers of corrugated that's almost
impossible to fold (the postal service can fold ANYTHING). They cost me
about 15-20 cents (maybe even less) a few years ago (I've still got some
left) at a time when the Calumet Carton jobbies were about 50 cents each.
That meant that the extra weight of the corrugated box (which costs more
in postage) offset the cheaper cost of the Calumet Carton flat mailer.
I haven't got the name handy, but if I remember I'll post it here.

The form I gave is the general equation for a special case, where
the asymptotes are perpendicular to the x-, and y-axes. I haven't
fiddled with these nasty guys in years xy=1 may be valid.
I'll leave the proof to you. Incidently, the source of this info
is my ancient and revered Hudsons manual, "The Engineer's Manual",
by Ralph B. Hudson. It's comfor to know that some things in this
 old world don't change over time.

Msg 41377 is 14 line(s) on 02/17/89 from JEFF DELINCK
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/CONTROL-S

Well, I can see your point about a car stopping at an intersection (ref-
erring to stopping the output at each screen full.) All I wanted to
say was it would be nice if I wanted to read a long message, to optionally
set a page stopper like the "more" command. That way I won't have to
worry about missing a control s and concentrate on reading.
 Of course, I realize that a more proper way to read a long doc-
ument would be to capture it in a buffer and read it later. There are
times, however, when I want to reply to the message in the same breath.
 Of course I can operate within the parameters of your bbs. I'm
only suggesting an option that might make your bbs more flexible.
 By the way, I like this bbs a lot. Keep up the good work.
Maybe if you had an edlin type utility for reading longer programs, it
would be nice. Well, I know that you probably can't implement any fea-
ture like that too easily.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: CBBS ORIGINAL EQUIP

Ward, if you talk to Randy before he comes to the party tomorrow,
ask him if he will bring the original CBBS display monitor and any
other equipment he still has. He also promised me he would get the
original modem back from the fellow he lent it (or sold it) to.
In addition, consider if you'd like to take the equipment into your
safe keeping. (I won't even ask for the $4 that Randy charged me
for it!)

Msg 41379 is 07 line(s) on 02/18/89 from ALEX ZELL

Roy, was it not you who snatched much of the stuff remaining after
Randy's garage sale a few years ago? I thought you have the original
- or near original- machine. Dunno which monitor he used but for at
least a couple of years (now it can be told) CBBS ran without a
monitor.
BTW - the party is "today" - Saturday 18 Feb 89 - not "tomorrow" -
at Barnaby's restaurant, 2832 W. Touhy. Usually starts about 1 p.m.
