Mike Warot did it again! I had a little task to do - converting palettes
between Deluxe Paint II format (.LBM) and a variation of a PC Paintbrush
format which has a separate 768 byte palette file.
 Mike hacked it out in Turbo Pascal in a couple hours, even shelling out
to the Deluxe-Paint-II supplied CONVERT program to do the picture
conversion. (which didn't handle the 256-color palettes).
 One palette was a simple R-G-B file x 256 times, the other had a byte
count in an offset within a file, etc - and one was an 8-bit color with
FF being the highest, the other had 3F as the highest, so there had to
be bit shifts, etc.
 If you have a little, not-too-difficult-to-describe need that you know
can be done by a VERY good "hacker" programmer, you might consider Mike
to do it.
 He's at 19-845-0880.

I have a problem! Philips my company, has a program in Turbo Pascal
that communicates with our equipment through RS-232. The software runs
on any IBM compatable computer with no problem. My problem is that I
have all CP/M computers including a laptop. Can I buy Turbo Pascal and
run the source code through and run it off my Geneva CP/M laptop? Or
do I need to modify the source i.e, the RS-232 routine for the EPSON?
The source I think is written in version 4 Turbo Pascal. Or can
someone compile it in Turbo Pascal for CP/M for me to save me the
problem of buying the TP for CP/M. What do you think of this?
