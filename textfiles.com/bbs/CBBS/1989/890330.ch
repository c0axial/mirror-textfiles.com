Sorry, I can't explain why things would be any different. Could it
be something MNP related? I notice that I sometimes fail to connect
after having my modem set for MNP and call a non-MNP system, even though
the HST documents the AT&M4 as being one that will establish MNP if it
can but go ahead anyway if it can't; &M5 is the one that hangs up if
no MNP is established.
 Sorry for the troubles.

No, they were looking for 4800 UDSs for use with PC Anywhere and
other strictly PC-PC uses. Specifically, they want to be able to
support remote Token Ring networks, by having PC Anywhere able to
call into the server. I told them I didn't know if it would work
but that for the $ they were spending they could be going 9600 instead
of 4800.

Jim, we've got 3 IBM token ring cards for sale, with the IBM PC LAN software
and multi-station access unit (connection device). While speed may
not be important, this will give you compatability with the most popular

The current US Robotics HST has a synchronous mode. It's nt compatible
with Bell 208's but it can work synch HST to HST.

Msg 41596 is 07 line(s) on 03/29/89 from MIKE ANDREWS
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/CBBS LOGON DELAYS

There may be slight delay while the HST waits to hear the MNP request.
The MNP request only occurs when the MNP modem is ORIGINATING. Otherwise,
it's transparent to the calling modem. There's a burst of binary data
after the connection is made. That's why some systems like Randy's
get upset when a MNP modem calls - the MNP request it read as off-speed
characters and it goes to a diffent baud rate to match. Some systems
lock up entirely on receipt of the MNP burst.

Msg 41597 is 10 line(s) on 03/29/89 from MICHAEL SZEWCZYK
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/XMODEM CRC

 One more question -

 The High CRC is the CRC Valuse of the first byte sent and the Low CRC
is the value of the CRC Value at the end of the Block?

 Also, thos numbers you used, are they the same for any block size? Or
would the 256 change to 1024 when using a 1k block?

 Connect IS probably MNP related. I have MNP and have yet to read the
manual but it has worked all the time on many BBSs for a long time
(MultiTech).

Msg 41599 is 06 line(s) on 03/30/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to MICHAEL SZEWCZYK re: R/XMODEM CRC

1) The significance of 4129 is that it's 1021 hex, which is actually
the divisor used in the polynomial computation (or so I understand).

2) I believe the standard has the CRC value going out low-byte-first,
high-byte-second ("Intel" order). The computation method doesn't change
with block size.

 Msg 41600 is 28 line(s) on 03/30/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to MIKE ANDREWS re: R/CBBS LOGON DELAYS
 When I was testing the new code here at home with my PC and a Hayes 2400
(they donate modems, too!) on my receive end, my CBBS logons wouldn't work
because the HST was trying to establish ARQ, and those characters were
taken as the "any 3 chars" that are supposed to let CBBS NOT blast at you
until you're ready.
 Thus, by the time the HST was letting CBBS back at me, it was half way
down the welcome and I had missed the logon date and time message (look
at the first lines CBBS sent on your session today).
 But of course this is not a problem, as I would just do an AT&M0 before
initiating a call to a system that I knew not to be ARQ.
 Summarizing the problems with the HST: the delays necessary while doing
modem initialization strings were the hardest thing to handle, as it changed
virtually every logon script I had. I finally went to a "subroutine" that
does pattern matching on the "OK<return>" in order to keep the modem from
choking on commands that the older Couriers could easily handle. THEN
I found all the places that by GONG to the "OK" pattern subroutine, blew
the patterns I'd previously established. It took I would say "a lot of
time" to get the scripts to where they are reasonably reliable. I'd really
be curious to know why in this ONE area things took such a big step
backwards compared to previous USRs. The modem is absolutely outstanding
in all other characteristics.
 BTW, went to visit the CTA yesterday, and found several day-old HSTs
being used for the Carbon Copy Plus application, and working just fine.
They had IBM modems before, and couldn't get them to work reliably. I'm
sure there was some AT command that wasn't 100% compatible with the various
modems that CC+ could select.
 They'll be using the modems to maintain the remote LANS in the garages
from the central site at Merchandise Mart.

This board is for programmers helping programmers. Not all of us were
born with programming experience like you apparently were. We have to
start somewhere.
 People often have to earn money while they learn. The best consultants
I know are the ones who say yes to the impossible jobs then go seeking the
knowledge necessary to get the job done.
 I was once thrown into a CARD RPG PAYROLL situatin with no knowledge.
I learned the language and system, found who at the customer was competent
to DESIGN the system, then programmed it. They were satisfied, (I didn't
say "thrilled"). If all you do is do what you know how to do, it is a
pretty narrow world. And if you don't dare seek expertise except with your
wallet extended, you don't understand what computer clubs, bulletin boards,
etc, are all about.
 There are exceptions: someone used a public-access Unix system (Chinet)
to compile a commercial maintenance release of their software, without
asking. A big fuss was made over this. On one hand there were no published
restrictions on what you COULD or could NOT do on chinet; on the other
hand the user should have asked anyway.
 I reaize where you're coming from with lots of experience, but tell me,
didn't you EVER go in over your head, and seek some advice - without
paying - from anyone?
 I'm writing this msg partly in response to # 41591, which you might want
to read.

Ooh, you're WAY out of line! I see you used the phrase:
 "You peddle yourself to some company as a software jock". He didn't
say that. He said "The company I work for needs.".
 Hells bells, if I didn't use the BBS's to find out that Foxbase was
better than Dbase, and that Foxbase had an unlimited run-time license,
we'd still be writing programs in BASIC because we couldn't afford all
the DBASE licenses! This way we're porting applications "all over the
place", and - literally - if I'd not used bulletin boards to SEEK
EXPERTISE I DIDN'T HAVE, I wouldn't have found out.
 OTOH, if this is a personal thing between you and Stutesman - i.e. he
took a job you were applying for and at half the rate, then please keep
your personal issues with him private (and this board has no private
messages, hint hint).

Msg 41604 is 11 line(s) on 03/30/89 from PHIL SCHUMAN
to WARD re: ASYNC VS SYNC

just a note of the different worlds of modems.
in the ASYNC mode, the UART in the terminal adds the start, stop, and parity
bits and also provides the clocking/speed for the bits to hit the wire.
in the SYNC world, ALL timing comes from the modem itself. It uses extra
pins in the RS-232 connector to send a timing pulse to the terminal, and
then wait for it come come back with a data bit slaved to the timing pulse.

Therefore, u can't just plug a SYNC modem into a ASYNC terminal (or DTE)
and have it work. nor can u plug a ASYNC modem into a 3780, 3174 or
whatever and have it work. unless the modem supports BOTH worlds and it
must be configured for which mode it is to operate in.

hi joe, i left a msg on your phone machine also, but need to add a note
the chip works perfectly (and FAST!) SYGRAPH plots produce in about
1/3 the time they used to, and number crunching really zips.
one thing i forgot to do was give you a copy of the receipt (for warranty
purposes) and let you know that MicroWay also provides their own one
year warranty on math chips (i think that's mentioned in the literature
that came with the chip. If you want a copy of the invoice, let me
know and i'll send it to you. Also, if you still have the receipt
from my chip, i'd like a copy for the warranty.

Msg 41609 is 10 line(s) on 03/30/89 from MIKE ROSE
to WARD ET AL re: DISK LOGGING IN MS-DOS 3.30

Apparently, I am not the only one with this problem: MS-DOS 3.30
does not always recognize disk changes. I have not been able to force
disk changes in the disk utilities I have and use. Sometimes using ^C
(shades of CP/M!) will force it to reread a directory, sometimes even
warmbooting the system will not effect a re-read! Anyone know of any
bug fixes? I guess I can go back to Dos 3.2, but some of its enhancements
are useful. Could it be the activation of the machinery necessary to
support "FASTOPEN"?
See also my next message.
Thanks.

to ALL re: DR DOS/EZ DOS 4.0

Does any vendor sell DR Dos or the EZ Dos package (contains
DR Dos, Top Dos, and GEM/3)? I've seen it bundled with new systems
and only once at a ham fest (Wheaton/Villa Park Odeum), for $69.
Though I sometimes loathe his opinion, John Dvorak praised DR Dos
in a PC Mag column, saying it ran anything he had for MS-Dos, was
ROMable, and was freshly written, not suffering the downward
compatability bugs of MS-Dos. It is reputed to be MS-Dos 3.30
compatable. Does it have the disk logging bug mentioned in my
previous message?
I also see that MS-Dos 3.30 uses IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM instead
of the MSDOS.SYS and IO.SYS of 3.2 and 3.1-does this mean the COMMAND
interpreter may be at fault, since it is written by MicroSoft?
If you know of a source or sell DR Dos or EZ Dos 4.0, leave a message
here or call 587-6057 after 7PM weekdays.
Thanks.
