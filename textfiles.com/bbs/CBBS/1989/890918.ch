]Ward, responding to your suggestion in chinet mail, I think
you wasted enuf time on this.  Really doesnt matter if you do
remove it or not -- but only excuse for what seems to be his total
lack of comprehension suggests that he is mebbe eight years old.
I hope I was not too rough in my note to him.

flamerei on , and we do have some kind of image to uphold -- I
like to think{
I do think that we should just ignore stupid inquiries in the log and
zap stupid inquiries in the msg base without comment.  On the other
hand, this place is supposed to be sort of educational and mebbe
the kids should be given some extra consideration.  You should have
seen the questions I asked randy, ignatz and price when chinet first

to SCOTT TEIPE re: YOUR BBS

 You ask if your BBS is in the list we carry here. You
repeatedly ask Ward and his staff here to insert it in the list. The
header on the current Stillwaters list (and the one that will
replace it) specifically states that if you want a BBS listed you
must call Stillwaters BBS and ask them to add it to their list.
In order to prevent pranksters from posting fake numbers to harass
people every effort is made to check on new numbers to validate them.
That, too, is a function of the Stillwaters staff. As a special
favor to you, we added the number you supplied in a message here to
OUR copy of the new list. However, after several attempts to contact your
BBS at the number given, there is no answer. Having neither the time
nor the inclination to spend any more time on the matter, the staff here
decided to remove your number from our list and recommend that you
contact the Stillwaters BBS directly and ask them to verify your
number and put it in the list that they publish - and that we copy,
as many other BBSs do. Good luck.

 Some messages here were saying that the best thing about Prodigy was
its E-mail abilities. Can that send messages through gateways to other
services or mediums? In other words, can I send a FAX message (or TWX
or MCI Mail message) from Prodigy?
 I just got a 30-day fee trial offer in the mail, but dont' see much
there that would even justify $9.95 a month. There was an insert for
"NBD Express" home banking that will be available in this area, but it
also says (in fine print) "After the free 90 days, the bank will charge
a minimal monthly fee for NBD Express", so I'll probably skip that.
(Plus, I had a number of bad experiences with National Bank of Detroit
when I lived there; why would I want to repeat them?)

 I still haven't seen much to convince me to shell out $10 each and
every month for Prodigy.

Msg 42494 is 29 line(s) on 09/18/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to EARL HALL re: R/PRODIGY E-MAIL ??

Prodigy IS pretty interesting - I was showing it off to my neighbor
today, and we wound up spending about 2 hrs on it.
  It has things like live weather maps (i.e. they change every couple
hours), local forecasts, the ability to make airline reservations,
a BBS (which you will probably HATE because it assumes you are a complete
boob right off the turnip truck, and has NO expert user ability).
  This morning, Prodigy had my phone tied up for an extra 20 minutes,
because I got SO upset with its stupid BBS, that I just rebooted - then
later found my phone was still "off hook".  ;-)
  But seriously, you might give it a try and see if you like it.  You will
want to have at least EGA, since the CGA version is B/W, and not as
interesting as the color version.
  Should you join, my ID is TPPH95A.
  When you compare Prodigy (at $10/month) with Compuserve (at $12/hr?) you
will find Compuserve "pretty darned good", but Prodigy, "pretty darned
cheap". ;-)
  No, you can't send EMAIL thru gateways.  You can't capture your mail
to disk.  You can't prepare messages in advance.  You can't use any but
their 10-year-obsolete-toy-40-character-screens.  It is the BBS for the
"child in us" providing we want to be treated like a child.  I think the
bulletin board part was an after thought.  The rest of it is pretty
good.  It takes a while to get used to.
  There are a LOT of GOOD things about it - like a personal "path" - of
commands you want to automatically execute.  You just press F4 (or P
then enter) and you will go to the next section on your path.
  But be ready for Many disappointments: like how it throws away all
typeahead (it must be for CP/M people in the '70s) and how you{an't
print anything they don't support printing of directly.
  It is one of the best/worst systems I've seen.

I called 499-0048 and got the modem answered, (8-n-1) waited a few
moments and got no reponse. Is there a special comm parameter or
special program that talks to Prodigy. I use GT Powercomm 15.00

software to operate? Thanks.

to ALL re: RLL/MFM

I noticed when doing the low level format on my Adaptec ACB-2372
controller with an RLL drive I could use the DEBUG sequence of
-G=c800:5 to pull up the ROM formatting program from my controller.
I tried doing the same thing with a MFM controller and nothing!!
Is there a different ROM setting for DEBUG formatting program
in the MFM controller? I don't like using Disk Manager because it
doesn't allow a one 42.7 megabyte formatted partition. I think
DOS 4.0 using FDISK will allow a 42.7 meg ( entire ST 251 disk)
partition. But I can't find the low level generic commands to turn
on the ROM formatting program from DEBUG. Thanks.

Msg 42497 is 07 line(s) on 09/18/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to RICHARD HINTON re: R/RLL/MFM

DOS 4.01 DOES allow you to partition a LARGE drive into two drives
only. I can make my 80 meg any 1 or two sizes I want. I low
level with Disk Manager then use DOS 4.01. The Disk Manager
is supposed to slow down disk commands I guess thru a sepcial
sequence (reading the DM commands first) so DOS would be quicker.
I heard that DOS 3.3 also allows partitioning but maybe NOT
over 32 megs.

Yes... you have to use special software... They were giving out free 3

them at the PC Expo as well at McCormick Place Oct 3-5.
