Msg 42159 is 30 line(s) on 07/23/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: T1000

Reading msg 42155 selling a PC convertible for $900 - makes me want to
comment on the T1000 I just bought, used, for $725.
 This little gem comes with 512K and a single 720K diskette. Mine came
with an option - the 768K RAM card. It can be used 3 ways (simultaneously).
 First, you can, if you wish, use 128K to extend DOS memory to 640K. I
mostly use mine with a small editor, so left it at 512K DOS.
 Then, you can say how much you want to be EMS. I elected to use none.
 Then, the remaining can be a "non-volatile" cleverly-named "HardRAM"
drive - D:. Mine is therefore 768K.
 This may take DOWN battery life a bit due to the additonal memory, and
due to the fact that it is non-volatile i.e. the battery keeps it up,
but the fact that you can do so much work without using the floppy motor,
which draws a LOT of current, more than makes up for the additional
memory.
 While it has some drawbacks - rather "scrunched" screen, no backlight,
and only 4.77mhz, the built-in serial, parallel, CGA, composite, and
external 5.25" parallel port REALLY make the PC Convertible look sick.
 OH ==> I didn't mention the best thing: its weight - 6 pounds. I already
have a T1100+ (10-11 pounts) that I use all the time at work - meaning
"all" the time - it powers on at the beginning of the day and off at the
end. But 10 pounds is too much for a daily commute. The T1000's 6# is
much more appropriate, though I DON'T carry a briefcase AND it.
 I understand the T1000 recently came down in price, as did the 768K
card. This is in prep for some new announcements, so it MAY not be a good
time to buy it, OR then again it MIGHT be a good time - I guess it depends
upon whether the lowering in price is "relevant". (Uh, get what I mean?
I mean if the new ones were coming out in a month and were 5x as good,
then the T1000 would have to be pretty darned cheap to be worth the
money). Owell, I'm happy - at least until the new announcements come.
 I should sell my T1100+ - I have two offers already.

to JERRY OLSEN re: R/CLEANING DISK DRIVES

I've been using PCs since '83 or so, and have never used a head
cleaning kit. I have not been - uh, what word to use - "inclined" to
do so because I've not had problems.
 Do you actually encounter unreadable diskettes that are "fixed" when
you've cleaned the heads?
 Perhaps the fact that I've never had a floppy-only system (except
my 2.5 year old Toshiba T1100+) is why I've not had problems.
 I HAVE had many problems with the 8" drives - but then they were often
floppy-only. I used to have things like the little "pressure pads" for
single-sided drives. Fortunately you could open the drives and swab
them with a q-tip and isopropyl alcohol. Matter of fact, CBBS/Ward Board
right now has trouble reading the inner tracks, but the same diskette
reads OK in the other drive. I will open it and clean the heads, and if
that doesn't do it, I'll probably swap with another drive - I have a
low-usage B: drive, and a 3rd drive left over from my un-used S-100
system. (I put my two "new" double sided 8"ers on an old PC Portable,
and use it for backups, etc - work GREAT, but I had to spring for a
special controller that matched the funny 40 (?) pin connector on the
old drives. Fortunately, it just "plugged right in" (after I struggled
for a while to overcome the lack of documentation on what DIRECTION to
plug the non-polarized plug into - I did so be using an ohmmeter to find
which side were all grounded on both plug and socket).

to ERIC BOHLMAN re: THANX FOR DUMB-TERMINAL INFO

 Eric, thanks for the info about the "dumb terminals." That's exactly
the type of info I was looking for -detailed specific info on using the
terminals and connecting-up to distant host via phone line, from someone who
speaks from first-hand experience.
 When I read that some terminal (I forget which one) had a RS232C
port I strongly suspected that connecting one to a modem would be just
as easy (or difficult!) as connecting a computer to a modem. But to hear
you state it as a fact is much more reassuring than something I have only
figured out by logic.
 Although I've spent what seems to me to be a lot of time down at the
Chgo Public Library downtown checking on books and magazsine articles,
the type of very-useful info you gave has not come to me from any source
other than users of this BBS. So thanks again for your thoughtful and
extensive answer to my request for vicarious first-hand experience with
"dumb terminals."

Colin, please give me a call at 312-584-2989. I have decided that it

require that I ask you to separate the monitor. How many slots does
the machine have open?

Msg 42165 is 10 line(s) on 07/24/89 from LANE LARRISON
to ANYONE re: SUBST PROBLEM

A friend asked me to configure his XT style computer so that it
substituted an alphabetical character for a path name. All of our
office PC's and XT's are setup this way: So I did. I changed the
CONFIG file, set up the appropriate directory names and changed the
AUTOEXEC file to SUBST the character for the name. It worked fine for
a time, then suddenly began issuing "Cannot subst networked drive"
on boot-up. There is, of course, no network. All the machines are
running under DOS 3.2. Does anyone know what would be causing this
error? (Networked directories aren't documented in the manuals that
I've gotten to so far.) Any guidance will be greatly appreciated.

Msg 42166 is 13 line(s) on 07/24/89 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to ALL re: ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM

Just loaded DOS 4.01 and got all my files organized. The problem I have
MIGHT have happened with DOS 3.2 IF I had used the same AUTOEXEC.BAT
but I do have it now.
 My "major" program I run "set"s two names prior to running. If
I use the Autoexec.bat file I made with all the paths for QuickBasic
and it's routines, MY program shows "out of environmental space".
If I limit my autoexec.bat file to "dos/batch" sub dirs. and a few
small pgms, it is OK. How does the size of the autoexec.bat cause
the environment to run out of space? I will have to have TWO such
files and rename and re-boot for QBasic if I can't figure out what
is happening and how to correct it.
 I gather you can load another Command processor with MORE
environmental space but I get lost there.

Msg 42168 is 12 line(s) on 07/24/89 from JIM SACKETT
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM

I had a problem with a nice program I wrote to menu select different applic
ations. The same error would occur. I found that when the application
loaded and I ran my application everything was fine. However when I re-
turned to the original program that called it - the program was duplicated
in memory and the application would no longer have the room to run.
I now run in UNIX which forced me to abandon my menu program completely due
to limited space. I also run solid DOS 3.2 when running First Publisher
due again to the memory limitations.
You may want (or have too) weed out things in your autoexec. you don't need.
You can use PCTOOLS or DEBUG to see if duplication might be the case.
Then the other option is add more memory.

1) make sure that your LASTDRIVE is set properly.
2) make sure you aren't SUBSTing anything that's already been SUBSTed
(i.e. if you said SUBST E: C:\LANGUAGE, don't then say SUBST F: E:\TURBO).

Msg 42170 is 22 line(s) on 07/25/89 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM

Richard:
 The problem you've run into has a simple solution in DOS
3.X, which (I think) has disappeared with 4.01. In 3.X, you
could use the SHELL command in config.sys to expand the envir-
onment space to however many bytes you wanted it to be, but
4.01 did away with the /E:# switch on the SHELL command, at
least for COMMAND.COM. What's happening is that PATH, SET, and
certain other variables are loaded into the environment as
strings (you can display environment contents by typing SET <cr>
at the dos command line). When your program issues SET commands
and the environment is almost full, it overflows and you get a
nasty error message (actually this one is almost too innocuous,
given its consequences). Cutting down your autoexec.bat solves
this problem by loading less info into the environment at boot
time, and thus leaving more room for your program's SETs.
Since I run into this problem fairly often in supporting the
stats package produced by my company, I often recommend against
upping to dos 4.01, but that probably doesn't help you. I don't
know of a simple solution to your dilemma, but you might contact
microsoft and ask them (also ask 'em ifthey're going to "fix"
the SHELL command-dropping the /E switch was a major faux pas!)

I can't add more memory to the XT. Think for now I will put PLENTY
of my commands in the last line of the Autoexec.bat, which
is a batch file and let that carry it along. I WILL have to
switch autoexec.bat files for certain applications then reboot
and this seems the simplest besides getting upset with MS and
sending them one of my nasty letters.

I guess after shelling out $130 for DOS 4.01, I WILL let MS have a
piece of my mind. Maybe they will just send an optional command to
use. Whatever, it MIGHT help.
 I have so many MS pgms that I should be able to get nasty enough
without being sued for my thoughts!

I checked a PCDOS 4.0 manual today at wor{ and the /E parameter of
the SHELL command of CONFIG.SYS is still there. The shell command is a
bit confusing as you do not really want to substitute another program for
COMMAND.COM (unless you know you want to and why) but is you so{cify
SHELL at all you apparently must code in what would otherwise be a
default. The SHELL command will look like this (from my CONFIG.SYS for
MSDOS 3.2on my Tandy 1000):
SHELL=C:\COMMAND.COM /P /E:1024
This raises the environment space from the default of 160 bytes to 1024.
You can make it any value up to 32K, but 1K was enoughfor me.
The PATH and COMSPEC occupy environment space so it is common to need to
increase it. I use REALIA COBOL which has an option of specifying files
the way MVS COBOL does with SET statement subdtituting for DD
cards, so 160 bytes did not go far for me. By the way, if there are any
MSDOS 3.1 users still out there, The shell command can increase the
environment space in that version also, but the syntax is
different and not in the manual. I can get if if anyone wants it.
