OK. Enjoyed your visiting CBBS. Where ever you go, call now and then!

to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/YER LAPTOP

"Try VDE as a text editor". Sorry, "No way". PMATE is my favorite
editor, is only 28K, and handles files of any size.
 ROFF: Not the general kind of text editing I'm likely to do. For
example, I'm given a file containing a mailing list, with from 5 to
7 lines per entry. I need to look to see which one starts with "("
then based upon which line of the entry, back up and insert the right
number of blank lines so they all come out to 7 lines; then I need
to combine the 7 lines into 1 with comma and " delimiting for DBASE.
 I GUESS that is still best done with PMATE, my favorite programming
language (grin).
 P.S. it was in the CP/M environment that I first grew to loving
PMATE. Its functions are about the same in the PC version - they
never updated it except to do a few things like add file path
ability, etc.

XMODEM is documented on the Ward Board CBBS, (312) 849-1132, in
the low numbered messages (use the S command for a summary, start
with msg 1). I think it is 4 thru 7 or something. I forget.
 Yes, the protocol is public domain.

Does anyone have any experience with PC FAX Boards? I'm in the process of
evaluating some and wondered if anyone else has tried them. I would
appreciate any input you can give me.

Thanks in advance,
Marty

Marty
There is a very good write up in PC Magazine Volume8 Number7 .
This is the April 11, 1989 edition. There is a summary of features
on pages 102 & 103 and a review of the boards examined. The
Editors Choice was the JT-Fax 9600. You may want to take a look
at the magazine for feature comparisons, list prices, ect .

Well.you ain't looking for an editor, you want a programming
language! You could check out MicroEMACS, but that's still a
fair bit of code. How big is PMATE under MS-DOS? Just out of
curiosity? I've never seen it running under CP/M, though I
have heard of it (Charlie Kestner has it, I think).
