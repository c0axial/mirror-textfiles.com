Tell me, does this "change your perspective on life?  I think I'm about
ready for a "life threatening situation" so I decide if I'm interested
or not (mostly not, right now - never HAVE been "very" interested).

to MARK WATERBURY re: R/XMODEM OR MODEM7 FOR CP/M

Gee, sorry, I've just not been into CP/M for about 5 years. Isn't there
some kind of Heath users group "or something"? But even if there is,
they might not cater to the "vintage" systems ;-)
 You might try the Heath store - they might keep track of clubs, etc.
they might also leave a msg to "ALL" on this, and perhaps a msg to
"CACHE members" to ask if there's a Zenith group still affiliated with
CACHE.

HD formatted LD causes low write current, doesn't saturate the magnetic
material. 600 oersteds coercivity on 1.2M media simply isn't able to
be magnetized with a signal designed for 360K 300 oersted media.
 Formatting DS/DD to 1.2M has always given about 400K of bad sectors-
a VERY bad idea.

to ALL re: VGA/EGA

I saw an ad for a ITT VGA monitor (780 X 400) for $299.00. I am
wondering, can a VGA monitor run software designed for EGA? or CGA?
I might like to pick up a VGA or EGA system, but what is the "best"
system, I don't do much video games and I sometimes question
whether a VGA/EGA system would be worthwhile?ut I don't know.

thanks for the info. if you happen to know a phone number where I can get
in touch with CACHE, I'd appreciate it. Do tey run a BBS? I'll also
persue your idea to check with a Heath Zenith store. There's one in Downer's
Grove. I haven't done much with CP/M for about 8 years myself. I am
trying to help a friend of mine who picked up an old H-89 computer dirt
cheap. Thanks again.

to CACHE MEMBERS re: HELP ON H-89 CP/M SYSTEM

I've got this old Heath/Zenith H-89 computer with soft sector 5 1/4" 360K
dual floppy drives (H-37 controller). Anybody got any idea where I can get
some software for this beast? I guess the first thing I need is a terminal
emulator with MODEM7 or XMODEM software so I can download stuff. Also, if
anyone knows someone who has a system like this, and has 8" floppied
attached, I have some old CP/M 8" disks I'd like to try and convert to 5 1/4
format. Does CACHE still distribute CP/M public domain software? If so,
any information on how to get some would be appreciated. Thanks

I'm planning to have a user's manual printed for a commercial software
package I wrote. It looks like perfect binding is the way to go. Do
you have any suggestions as to where I can get the printing done at a
reasonable cost? Neighborhood shops like PIP don't seem to be set up
to do anything much more elaborate than letters, resumes and the like.

to RICHARD HINTON re: R/VGA/EGA

I have an old ATI video board and Samsung CM4531 EGA on my XT and
it runs great. Games, programming etc.
 I have a NEC MultiSync 2A on my new 386 with a Paradise VGA Plus
and it looks like it will run what I need perfectly. Haven't tried
CGA etc for colors on the VGA yet but it looks positive. For games
I would go the EGA route with a simple monitor. It seems that a
lot of the internal operations of the videos make a big difference
with the speed of the system. "I" think an XT is pushed with EGA
due to a lot of the slowness of the programs (other than games).
A couple pgms I have run a tad slow on the 386 (poor programming?),
ans so slow on the XT I can have a cup of coffee.

to ALL re: VDISK 386

I understand that with the VDISK.SYS I can run a ramdisk in exteneded
OR expanded memory bu the switches I set. QUESTION: Does that
mean that starting AFTER 640K, the ramdisk start up or after the
one meg mark? I am not sure about the instructions about this. There
is so much about ram for video etc it is confusing me. I am curious
so I can figure out how I might configure the system before loading
any programs.

You might want to give a call to the Advocate BBS (939-4411, Loop) and
leave a message (non-private, please) to Jerry Olsen. He's in the graphic
arts field and knows a lot of printers and binderies.

Msg 42278 is 12 line(s) on 08/12/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/VDISK 386

When you specify extended memory, you're referring to the memory above
the 1 meg mark. For example, if you have 1 meg of onboard memory, it's
usually mapped (in hardware) so that the first 640K of it goes into physical
addresses 0-640K, and the remaining 384K goes into the physical addresses
starting at 1 meg. So if you put a RAM disk into extended memory,
it won't conflict with controller roms, video memory, etc. which are
all in the physical address range between 640K and 1 meg. I've done
it once or twice; on my machine it didn't seem to improve speed all
that much (in order to access extended memory, the CPU has to be shifted
out of real mode into protected mode and then back. Going back often
requires some trickery involving doing a hardware reset to the CPU,
which takes up time).
