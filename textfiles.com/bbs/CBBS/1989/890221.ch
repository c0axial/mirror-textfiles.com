to MIKE ANDREWS re: R/MODEM ADJUSTMENTS.

Thanks! I have reassembled CBBS to look for the ARQ codes, but it didn't
work (meaning that I have an error somewhere in the assembly). I will
probably have to test the code here "at home" calling into another system,
then put it up on CBBS/Chi.
 Smithsonian, eh? That WOULD be kind of neat!

-8086 was VERY intentional.

Msg 41389 is 04 line(s) on 02/21/89 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to WARD/ALL re: 10-NET

We have two '286 machines at work that are networked w/10-Net. I just
got a call from my boss saying that, for some reason, 10-Net and
Paradox won't work together. Anybody had similar problems? Solutions?
I should be able to gather more detail on this soon.

Msg 41390 is 10 line(s) on 02/21/89 from JIM POLOUS
to ALL re: LOCAL AREA NETWORK

I would like to set up a LAN, but not too expensive. I'm seriously
considering TOPS because of its "serverless" operation. I want to network
a 386 and 3 Turbo XT machines. I have the 386 and one of the Turbo machines
connected currently using serial ports and Desk Link from Traveling Software
this works fine except that if a disk error occurs I have to run into the
next room and correct it. Speed is not that important and neither is distance
in fact three of the four computers (2 XTs and the 386) will be within inches
of each other. The other XT will be about 20 feet away. I once heard of
a network that used a parallel printer port. Has anyone had any experience
or heard of such? Anyone know of anyone selling any network equipment, cheap?

Msg 41391 is 13 line(s) on 02/21/89 from MIKE COOK
to ALL re: HD 3 1/2" DRIVE IN IBMPC

Has anyone successfully added a high density drive (3 1/2") in an IBM
PC? This is in an original IBM PC but with the "newer" BIOS that allows
for hard disk and 640K of RAM. I have spoken with a number of people
who sell drives and so-called high density controllers (for the "XT").
Some tell me that the IBM PC won't accept 1.44 MEG format due to BIOS
incompatibility but IBM compatibles WILL! That's a switch! Some say
it's no problem at all. Some say it requires a Compaticard controller
and/or DOS 3.3.
Any ideas? Also, if I install a 1.44 MEG drive and attach to my current
controller, will it operate in 720K format until I add the proper
controller and/or driver software?
Thanks for any insight into this!
Mike
