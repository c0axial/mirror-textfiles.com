]hi - my name is ray davis and I was looking for information on the
development of the crc check used in Xmodem (CRC). The reason for my
interest is I'm writing a small handler to connect some Varian Data
Machines Minicomputers to our PC's for remote testing.

How is it compared to say 2 months ago before we got the new modem? It
should be better, but then there's no way to avoid all problems. The
noise could be on our line, or on your line.
 We now have USR ARQ (i.e. MNP) so if you're shopping for a new modem in
the near future (or even far future ;-) you might consider MNP, which will
handle errors.

Thanks for the bit of history. At the yard sale, I'm sure Randy
told me that one or another piece of equipment was on loan to
someone. I had always thought it was the modem card.

"Getting the thing running again"? Do you still have the original
software? As for hardware, I suppose you could get some "prosthetic"
replacements for the parts that are missing. (Maybe paint them
bright orange so viewers won't be misled!) I'm only in town
sporadically ow, so any messages left here for me will take weeks
to be read and responded to. If that's not fast enough,
you can reach me at (812) 333-1874 eves. Or leave a message for
Mike Andrews, and he can call me.
