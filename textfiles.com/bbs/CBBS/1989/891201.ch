No, I didn't see that sound board. I think next time I go to comdex,
I'll start asking WHAT people "want me to look for" about a month before-
that way I'll have some goals. I kind of "wandered aimlessly" a lot
of the time (I only was free about 3 hours a day).

Ya, I talked to Randy, and he no longer recommends SCO. My "info" was
rather out-dated so talking directly to him is the best way. He
mentioned some PC based Unix systems that were quite a bit cheaper.
 Today I added up the prices for IBM's AIX - 1-2 user system, development
tools, C, X-windows, NSF, and a few other things - hit >$2K just for
the software!

to RICHARD GOZDAL re: 360K PROBLEM

Richard,
 Your problem happens because the 1.2 Meg drives have twice
as many tracks as the 360K units. Consequently, the Read/Write head
is half as wide, and thus cannot correctly write to 360K drives,
particularly if there is any information currntly on the 360K disk.

to JAMES KARAGANIS re: R/360K PROBLEM

 Yea, and hooking up three floppies is a little bit of a pain also.
Most of the problem is taken care of. After hearing about some
mail order 386s though I am quite pleased especially with the
Micronics motherboard. Would you believe that you could wind up
with a plain 386 by mail, one that won't swith down to a slow
AT speed? Guess you have to do more than read between the lines
with the mail order stuff.
 Local is best IF the price is GOOD.
