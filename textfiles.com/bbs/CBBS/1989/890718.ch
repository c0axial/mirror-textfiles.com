]Thanks Ward for the Crash course.  I have pulled out an old pair
of glasses and put an new modem program which seems simple enough
for me to use. With all this help, I should do better. Jean

 My modem has gone totally bye-bye and a replacement may not be
available for awhile. so I guess I'll be seeing you folks.

to PAUL STREETER re: R/RECRUITER BBS

I selected VT100 for two reasons. 1) the system is a VAX and VT100
was DEC's native terminal for that machine. 2) the vast majority
of communications programs support VT100 emulation. By using a
terminal protocol like VT100, I could then write the system to be
completely menu-driven{and take advantage of the emulation's
advanced video abilities.
.
In addition, the first menu you receive is OK for TTY. No special
escape sequences are sent until after the opening screen. If you
were having problems at that pointf* I'd suspect line noise.
What type of machine do you use?

to ALL re: 386-16 FOR SALE

if anyone is interested, I'm considering selling an ALR 386/16 with
387, 43Mb Miniscribe HD, 2meg RAM, and real Hercules mono. It's
about 1 1/2 yr old and in perfect shape; the only reason for selling
is that I want to upgrade to a machine with more motherobard memory
capacity, bigger HD, and VGA color. Will sell complete or "stripped"
i.e. without 387 and/or monitor/card and/or the 'extra' 1meg RAM.
Leave me a msg here if you'd like more info.

 Need information about standard Time-Sharing terminals
-asynchronous ones such as DEC VT-100, WYSE WY-50, IBM 3101, Televideo.
 Anyone out there who has first-hand experience with using or with connect-
ing-up any of these terminals? Or any leads to info in publications?
 Thanx.
