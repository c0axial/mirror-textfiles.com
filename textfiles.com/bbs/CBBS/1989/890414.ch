to ALL re: TEXT RECO & HAND SCAN

Got a new "toy" a couple days ago - "Carets by Hand Deluxe" - a text
reco package (CARETS = ChAracter RETyping System), which works with the
DFI HS-3000 hand scanner!
 I just scanned a little product item in the March Byte mag (about
the WILLOW TV-compatible VGA) and got about 7 errors in maybe a K of
text - pretty impressive!
 It can learn new monospaced or porportional fonts, handles ligatures
(fl type combos that are joined). When training, you can tell it to
split things it mis-interpreted, or join things it accidentally split,
and many other features.
 It seems to do virtually flawless recognition of HPLJ courier, and
comes with recognition fonts for US News & World Report, Byte, TIME,
Scientific American, PC World - and possibly others, I forget.
 A friend at work came up with a novel idea - NOT correcting words it
scanned - when you have scanned them just to have a hard copy of an
article - your "mind" can fill in the typos. All you might want to do
is ensure the "key words" in the article are correct should you wish to
use something like Gofer or LookFor (or even grep) to find text.
 Pretty slick!
 I'll upload the article "as scanned" in the next message.

to ALL re: USING THE TIMER TICK

To anyone,
I'm trying to use the clock interrupt on the PC. I can get
the interrupt vectored to my handler correctly but the interrupt routine
is unable to access any variables in my local data segment. This is
probably something to do with a missing pseudo-op or something but
I don't know. Also, I need to increase the clock rate to about 50 Hz.
How would I do this? Thanks, Jim K.

If your still looking for a consultant (I was working COMDEX for the last
week so I may be a bit tardy) my firm probably fits your description.
We specialize in real-time control and embedded systems. I'm an expert
in 8085 assembler and C, and have 3 years experience coding in C and
assembler on the 68000. I used an Applied Microsystems emulator in
that work. The job entailed developing a embedded system for conversion
of typesetting code. If you are interested or want details give me a

to JAMES KARAGANIS re: R/USING THE TIMER TICK

I can only offer some general hints, not et having tackled such a project,
but here goes. When an interrupt is serviced, all segment registers
except for the CODE segment haven't been changed from what they were
when the interrupt came along. You'll have to explicitly load up the
data and stack segment registers, as well as the extra segment if you're
going to use it.

If you want to increase the clock-tick rate, you'll need to do two
things: 1) you'll have to reprogram the timer chip to put out a faster
rate and 2) your interrupt routine will have to divide the rate down
as far as calling the old routine goes (otherwise DOS's date and time
will get messed up. In other words, you'll have to maintain a counter
which you decrement each time you enter your routine. When it eaches
zero, you call the original routine and reload the counter. This gets
a bit tricky, because the new clock rate is 2.75 times the old one,
which means that you'll need to maintain another counter that tells
you when you have to call the original routine an extra time in order
to compensate for rounding (you might try calling the old routine once
every three ticks, and an extra time every thirty ticks).

Jim; Well long time no hear from !
The other reply to your msg was correct, I always stick the data
I need in an interrupt service routine in the code segment along
with the routine. Cause, on interrupt service the only register
that has a known value is the code segment (CS).

to JAMES KARAGANIS re: CBBS RESPONSIVENESS

CBBS how has an interrupt driven front-end, and should be MORE responsive
to input, i.e. I'm no longer losing chars which I accidentally type too soon
after hitting return, for example.
 Do you have an MNP modem? If you do, then it WILL, of necessity, BE less
responsive because the modems are 'packetizing' and 'handshaking' (here's
some data, did you get it? Yep, I got it) etc.
 Could that explain it?

Msg 41692 is 21 line(s) on 04/14/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/SCANNER

The scanner handles +/- 5 degrees or so - it is in other words, not
very sensitive to the scanning angle. It is most sensitive to the
contrast control - if too light, gaps appear in scanned letters, and if
too dark, tightly spaced text starts to bleed together.
 So far the worst trouble I've found was trying to get it to read a hard
cover book, which basically has a fairly large font, and the "W" and "M"
chars are sufficiently wide that it has a teeny bit of problem with 'em.
For example, look at this:
 This is an example of the many things that can happen might read as:
 This is an exarnple of the n:any things that can happen
 Heh heh - I got a kick out of "rn" being an "m" - it actually LOOKS like
an "m"!
 Owell, I'll have more time to experiment with it - haven't had that much
time - and though the book says "don't start working with training fonts
until you've gone through the 8 lessons in the book", like most users, I
found myself barely getting into it before going ahead to training. There
are a few things I've probably missed. For example, there's a "retrain"
function key - I think that's if it consistently says an i is a !, you can
"retrain" it to say "when you THINK you have a !, make it an i".
 Strangely, it is VERY VERY enjoyable working with the scanner - 'psyching'
out why it made certain substitutions, etc.

I guess I counted wrong. I had Turbo 3.0, an uprade from 2.whatever.
My experience with PASCAL was using Turbo to finish the course and
then selling it, vowing never to look at PASCAL again.

I wasn't sure that was a Turbo 4.0 for CP/M. I asked a Borland rep
at Comdex and he started making speeches about MACintosh software.
Guess he didn't know what CP/M was and tried to vamp.

Did you check out Microsoft's Basic Compiler?
It has alot of neat feature, plus it compiles very fast. Also, did you look
 at Turbo Basic. For a minimal cost, it comes with a compiler and some
other utilities that may help you. If you know Basic like me, it can
really be helpful. If you have any questions, please call me at:
