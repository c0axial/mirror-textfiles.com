Tell me, does this "change your perspective on life?  I think I'm about
ready for a "life threatening situation" so I decide if I'm interested
or not (mostly not, right now - never HAVE been "very" interested).

]==Ward: Stillwaters sted Stillwell.  Logical error, of course,
since they seem to be  *almost* synonymous in effect.
One flows, the other is static.
I wonder why we have stopped using oplog.  Kind of separates
the more personal "staff" messages from the stuff left by the
public, not to mention the untwitted twits.
I check both logs first at each logon.

I'm confused - "reviews of the ddials"? "W/B"? "Rocco"?
 At any rate, I believe you are talking something about the list of
BBS's that CBBS RE (emphasis on "RE") RE-prints. We are not the source.
It is like a syndicated column - the columnist controls the contents,
not the newspaper it is printed in.
 I WILL out of "social responsibility" delete, almost immediately, any
number which is mis-printed so that it might wake someone up in the middle
of the night - having had my own VOICE number published many times, I
"sympathize". But I am NOT the source for MAINTAINING the list. That is
just more effort than there are hours in the day for me to do. If this
msg were time stamped, you'd see it was entered at 1:00 in the morning,
and my alarm goes off to start the next day at 5:50.
 Thanks, I know you mean well, but address your comments to Stillwell
(sorry if I got that name wrong).

sorry to bug u about the numbers, i understand what u mean about giving
out numbers and being called early in the morning.well, try this number
989-4600 at 300 baud. at around 10 pm (if u can get it) it is a diverse dial
system. well, take care!

The Phoenix is a superb BIOS, but these are 80286 BIOS chips. You need the
single chip for the XT. KNow anyone wanting to upgrade their AT?

to ALL re: BOCA BOARD

ARRRRGGGGHHHH!

Remember what I said about the Boca ram expansion board? Forget it.
After working with the tech reps for hours and trying everything we
could think of, the board (8meg Boca board) DOES NOT WORK.

I'm going back to Wholesale Computer (in Wheeling) on Monday to get
my money back. The salesman assured me he would have a check waiting.
After all the hassle and number of weeks, I hope so. (I'll let you
know)

I checked several manufacturers and settled on an Everex 10000. It is
a LIM 4.0 10meg board that uses 1x1 drams. It has all of the features
of the Boca board and was guaranteed by the Everex reps to work.

Maybe by this time next week, I'll truly be a happy camper. -Rog

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: XMODEM OR MODEM7 FOR CP/M

Any ideas where to get a copy of MODEM7 or XMODEM for CP-M running on an
old Heath/Zenith H-89 computer running CP/M with H37 Soft Sector controller
and dual 5 1/4" 360K floppies? Suggestions would be welcome. Also, any
ideas of where to get WordStar or DBaseII that would run on that machine
would also be welcome. I am willing to buy the software.
Thanks

 I know someone who MIGHT want the chips but he is on an extended
vacation off in the world of travel now. Won't be back for maybe
4-6 weeks. There is always the CACHEFEST the 20th at DeVry!

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/3 1/2 " DRIVES

 The tech info on the 3 1/2 disks is enough to make me stay away
from MEI for medium quality disks. there's are rated at 600.
 I think I got in over my head with this 386. Now I have to read
whatever I overlooked on extended memory. The docs are OK
but that is if I want ot run software for adding stuff. I need
a RAM disk. Might have to see if I have one of those for
extended memory in my files. I have 2 meg and am totally
confused with using the rest of the 1st meg. I almost would
use one of the pgms to raise the 640K to 7XX+K but don't
want to screw up the memory for the VGA or programming.
 What a mess! The computer runs so fast I am MORE lost. How
long does it take to see the blurrs on the screen as meaning
something?!
 Would a program allow me to merge the rest of the 1st meg
with some of the 2nd meg of memory for a RAM drive? What I read
now seem to imply it has to be chnaged over to expanded memory first.
 Guess I HAVE to get to the CACHE FEST and see what I missed out
on for months.

to ALL re: DISKETTE QUESTION

As long as everyone is talking about the technical aspects of diskettes,
I have a question to pose. But first let me illustrate what I've tried:
1. Format a DS/DD disk to 360K - Works fine, like it's supposed to.
2. Format a DS/DD disk to 1.2M - Works fine.f* (90% of the time)
3. Format a DS/HD disk to 1.2M - Works fine, like it's supposed to.
4. Format a DS/HD disk to 360K on 1.2M drive - Track 0 bad, disk unusable
5. Format a DS/HD disk to 360K on 360K drive - Works fine
6. Format a 3.5" DS/HD to 1.4M - Fine, like its supposed to
7. Format a 3.5" DS/HD to 720K - Track 0 bad, disk unusable
->Why does track 0 seem bad to the computer on HD disks when formatting
them at the low density. In addition, when using a utility like PCTOOLS
to format differf*ent densities, it seems that the error occurs on Head 1,
but Head 0 is fine (for the first track). Any ideas?
