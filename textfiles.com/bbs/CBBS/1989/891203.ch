Msg 42827 is 18 line(s) on 12/03/89 from JERRY OLSEN
to ED FOSTER re: R/AREA CODE CONVERSION

My program publicized by Ma Bell <does> handle several phone numbers in a
data base's record, changing only those with a '312' prefix, not those
with '708'. As a 'generic' program, though, it relies upon the address to
determine whether to update the '312' numbers. Of course, this logic doesn't
deal with situations where one (or more) numbers remain in 312 and another
or others must be changed. As the documentation notes, in some such cases
you might want to run the program and "touch up" the bad records. And, if
your DB contains a bundle of such "exceptions," you may want to either
write a dedicated program, modify the source code (provided) or just do it
manually. (Hey, whatcha expect for $0?!) It has been helping a number of
folks, though. So the effort was worth it.

The prefix approach would be ideal, except that Bell has been playing games
about all that. I'd suggest you call the board I run and do an S;'708' (note
semicolon and SINGLE quote marks) in the msg base for a detailed outline
of that issue. And if you have further comments, I obviously get on there
frequently, whereas less so here. Thanx for the comments, though.

Msg 42828 is 13 line(s) on 12/03/89 from JERRY OLSEN
to JAMES SCHMIDT re: R/CLEANING DRIVES

I more or less agree with Ward's comments. If your system runs primarily
off a hard disk, I've found a cleaning once every 6 months to a year is
about right, depending upon the environment. On the other hand, when I
was using a single computer which had only floppies, I'd need to clean
it nearly once each month. These days, with 6 machines, most using HDs,
I hardly know where I left my cleaning kits (grin). Seriously, I now tend to
clean drives only when they show signs of difficulty in reading/writing.
 One often-overlooked question is whether to use the kits which include
liquid you spread on the cleaning disk or the abrasive type. I'm convinced
it's good to have one of each around. The liquid kits are <much> easier
on a drive. On the other hand, I've had several experiences over the years
where such kits didn't do the job. In that case, do a quick run with the
abrasive disks. Virtually always, that solves the problem.

This may be old stuff, but I thought I'd pass it along. I have just read
THE CUCKOO'S EGG by Clifford Stoll. Non-fiction that reads like fiction.
Highly recommended entertainment.

Any recommendations for an Outline Program for the
Apple. I am looking for something simple.
Any help will be appreciated.

Any information will be appreciated.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/PC-BASED UNIX OS

thanks for the additional info! I'll call Randy and find out why he
no longer recommends SCO. As for AIX, isn't IBM software always
fairly expensive, relative to competition?? ESIX 1-2 user with all
the same stuff should run about $1200 or so. Well, thanks again!

Msg 42833 is 16 line(s) on 12/03/89 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to JIM ANDERSON re: R/PC-BASED UNIX OS

I may be interested-didn't we exchange msgs about this before??
Is your copy of XENIX/386 version 2.x? I'm really looking to go
with a flavor of UNIX V version 3.2, but for that price I may be
willing to do it, just to get acquainted before laying out more $
for an upgrade.
What is included in the package you've got? Specifically, does it
include development tools; C compiler, make, sdb, etc.? Also, how
about text processing tools? And finally, does it include a DOS
shell that allows running DOS programs as tasks, and a file system
which allows cross-access (DOS prog-> UNIX partition/file,
UNIX prog-> DOS partition/file)??
I'm really looking to set up a UNIX/DOS machine and do low to med.
level development in both environments.
Please drop me a msg. with more info. If I don't hear anything from
you I'll probably give you a buzz on the phone.
 Colin

Msg 42834 is 09 line(s) on 12/03/89 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to JIM ANDERSON re: R/PC-BASED UNIX OS

Oops! Forgot a couple of questions in my other reply.
These concern hardware compatibility. First, does the XENIX you
have support ESDI disks/controllers (specifically the Adaptec 2322B
ESDI controller and the Miniscribe 3130E drive)? Does it support
VGA (or at least EGA) adapters-specifically the Paradise +16 card??
These are important considerations for me. Also, do you have any
idea if one can buy hardware that allows a standard mono monitor and
AT Enhanced type kbd to be linked to the CPU as a terminal?? If so,
what is it? Thanks in advance!

Bob, I like and use an old program. ThinkWorks from Megahaus, It's ProDOS
but I'm not sure if they're still in business. MECC also has a nice simple one.
Free if your schools a MECC member. It's just called the MECC
Outliner.
If you need more info call me at 312-275-7497

Msg 42836 is 22 line(s) on 12/03/89 from BILL WOLFF
to ALL re: CLEANING DRIVES

In my eight years of computer use, I had never cleaned a disk drive. Nor
have I ever demagnatised them. I also never had to replaced a worn out
disk drive head. Nor do I have read/write errors caused by my heads. Also
never would I recomend the abrasive type of cleaners. That is a good way
to end the life of a good head. It is like using sand paper on them. True
it works, but your heads have a shorter life.

All that I have studied about the subject. Most experts say the type of
disks are the important factor. Soft (cheap) disks causes more dirt and
requires more cleaning and hard (big bucks) disks wears your heads more.
BTW, dirt can wear the heads too!

So what do you do? You got me? Do you want to keep your drives a long
time? Then don't clean them unless you have problems. I doubt that
cleaning the drives will ever help in most cases. As it never helped me!
BTW, the disks I use, the cheaper the better!

I do oil the drives with sewing machine oil about every eight months or
so. That's seven disks drives I do that to, and never clean the heads.
Plus if the heads do build up a film. It will really pervent your heads
from wearing out. If it still reads and writes, what more can you ask?
