to ALL re: THE FUTURE OF PCS

What do you think the future of PCs is?
 I see laptops going "every which way" - there's a market for
"smaller, lighter, more portable", and also a marketplace for
"my one big powerful machine that I take with me".
 Mark Eppley, Prez of Travelling Software, says that this will
be the year for the Pocket PC. I can't wait!
 I would love to be able to do my reports, and write (text, not
publish) a newsletter while commuting on the train.
 Who knows what will become the standard MEDIA - I hear Zenith
is going fot the 2" diskette! (or was it 2.5"?). Others are going
for software cartridges. - silicon, etc.
 My REAL requirement is: (1) to have the ctrl key left of A; and
(2) to (related to 1) be able to run my favorite editor on it.
 I could get by with 256K, actually, and a 2.5" diskette, and a
"typeable" keyboard, though I would be in the minority with such
meager requirements.
 -
Curious for your ideas and opinions.
 What machine do each of YOU see in YOUR future? I think I'm more
interested in true portability, and not as interested (probably because
of the investment) in "high end" stuff - my 10mhz 0-wait state machine
is going to hold me for a while, though I could use more disk, or better
organization of my disk.

to BILL WOLFF re: R/TURBO PASCAL CONVERSION?

The communications code, at the very least, will need to be completely
reworked because the TP program is almost certainly making direct I/O
accesses to the serial ports (the facilities that DOS provides for this
are almost useless). Remember that there's no standard for serial I/O on
CP/M machines; for example, most CP/M terminal programs use custom overlays
for each machine they can support.

Another problem is that there are a fair number of differences between Turbo
Pascal version 4 and version 3; only version 3 is available for CP/M.

1. Microsoft will not introduce Quick COBOL.
2. Borland will not introduce TURBO COBOL.
3. Herb Grosch will not be elected CEO of IBM.
4. Onyl Roger Hale and Ward will know who Herb Grosch is, and they won't
 really care.
5. Unless the METRA line you use is a lot smoother than the Burlington,
 which I used to ride, you won't be able to do much work on the train,
 even with a pocket computer. (Someone prove me wromg by saying how many
 people already work with laptops on the train. I could never concentrate
 enough to do anything useful during the ride.)
6. CPM machines and CPM shops won't die and a lot of obsolete machines will
 be made and purchased by people who realize they are the most cost
 effective for most tasks.
7. A useful pocket cumputer would haqve to have some kind of keyboard
 technology that I can't imagine in order to be a good idea for most of
 us, but massive memory will be easy.
8. Flat screens for color VGA/EGA should be possible now, if they are not
 on the market already.
9. My best prediction is that laptops with a 12 Mhz 286 r 386, 40 Mb or
 larger disk capacity, LPT1, LPT2, COM1, and COM2 ports built in and
 at least 2 short slots and one full length slot will become affordable
 as an alternative to a desk top computer.
10. Someone will introduce an envelope feeder of production capacity for
 "normal" dot matrix printer. The repeatability of the registration
 will be 1/8 " or better.
 My introduction to computers was via a Honeywell 400 (made by
Honeywell, not GE). It was upgraded to its maximum memory of 32 K just
after I started. It had 3 phase power to a motor generator for its power
supply, 3 tons of air conditiioning with 3 tons backup, a CE on site 8
hours a day, and took 1 hour to compile 1000 lines of COBOL vs 1 min on PC.

I have a question on UDSD Pascal! I got it free with my Osborne
Executive. They also call it the "P" system. I never done much with
it, but they said that the system uses a universal format for all
other "P" systems. So what is this really? The first Pascal language
or what? I've never done much with it, except boot it up and say, "Oh
that's nice!" and then put it away.

Msg 41662 is 10 line(s) on 04/09/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to BILL WOLFF re: R/UDSD PASCAL???

It's "UCSD" (the software was originally developed at the University of
California, San Diego). The P-system was an alternate operating system,
originally introduced on Apples if I remember right, that supported Pascal.
The idea was for the compiler to generate a "universal" intermediate code
rather than native code. Each version of the P-system would have its own
interpreter for this code, known as P-code. Of course, this had some draw-
backs: execution was rather slow, and since file system facilities aren't
the same from machine to machine, they had to be "shoehorned" into a common
format, meaning that UCSD Pascal programs could use only P-system files, rat
rather than general files native to the operating system.

Msg 41663 is 20 line(s) on 04/09/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to PAUL STREETER re: R/ PREDICTIONS

I have trouble seeing how a laptop could support full-size (full HEIGHT)
slots and still be laptop size. The other features will eventually be
implemented (though with current chip technology, power consumption goes
up with clock speed, so that will probably be the last thing done).

Pocket computer keyboards: If the original "Star Trek" were being produced
now, the producers would have to come up with some rational-sounding
explanation for how data gets entered into tricorders (probably mind-reading).
When the show was originally done, pocket computers were far enough into
the future that viewers wouldn't thing of questioning it. In the late
seventies, there were attempts to make "eggs" and other alternate-input
devices that would allow data entry by pressing combinations of six or
so switches, but they never caught on. Maybe a tiny trackball to pick out
letters (seriously, a friend who has very limited use of his hands uses
that on a Macintosh)? Voice entry might be possible, though it would be
slow and I can imagine a bunch of people on a train getting their dictation
crossed up (to say nothing with confidentiality problems; imagine two
attorneys on opposite sides of a case getting the last two adjacent seats
on the train, or the stockbroker whose computer "accidentally" listens in
on some juicy inside information).

to ALL re: T/PASCAL V4.0 EXEC FUNCTION

Need a little help with the Turbo Pascal command 'exec'
Here's the problem: whenever the exec command is used to execute
a compiler/interpreter (GW-BASIC or Turbo Pascal itself), the
command.com file is loaded into the program (???). Also, whenever
PC-Write is executed using the same command, again the command.com
file is loaded, forcing me to quit that file and load the desired
file manually. Any ideas/elanations of this phenom. from all you
TP Experts out there would be appreciated.

Msg 41665 is 06 line(s) on 04/10/89 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to ALAN LAYA re: R/T/PASCAL V4.0 EXEC FUNCTION

I haven't used TP4, but I've done some execing in C, which should be similar.
Make sure you have ALL the command-line arguments right; I would assume that
the exec function loads command.com and passes the program name to it as
an argument, i.e. COMMAND GWBASIC FLOOBLE in order to run FLOOBLE.BAS. If
the arguments are set up wrong, COMMAND may not be finding the right program
to execute and may be dropping to prompt mode.

Turbo-PASCAL 4.0 is still available for CP/M. I had a copy, but sold it.
Call Borland to order it. You'll still have to rewrite the I/O routines
to talk to a CP/M machine. There are some built-in I/O functions in
TP 4.0, but they're a lot different than what you'd see on a DOS machine.
