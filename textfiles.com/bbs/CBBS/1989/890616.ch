Very interesting.  I go along with what you said, minus the
Seagate.  I just don't trust those folks.  Too many people on CIS
with dead ST-251s.  Also a couple NW Indiana buddies had 4 of 'em,
and between about 1 and 3 months after warranty, they all died.
  Priam and Core are the best, but they DO cost a lot!
  I'm jealous of your purcase - I spent 4 K also, but got only a 2M
286 at 10mhz, VGA, etc.
