Msg 42629 is 19 line(s) on 10/16/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to FRANK SPIVEY II re: MODEMS

 "What's the big diff between modems of various costs?"
 "What's the diff beteween a level 5 MNP and an $89 special?"
 Well, yes, noise immunity IS one of the characteristics between
cheap and expensive modems.
 You may assume it is OUR modem however - we have old USR's on here,
and there seems to be quite a bit of noise. I have a 9600 modem which
seems quite quiet (and is MNP) but it went back via UPS for a ROM upgrade
but got lost for a month or more - I've just asked Randy why.
 A little { every now and then seems to be something in the telephone
trunk{line multiplexors switching <- I left one there instead of
correcting it>
 Modems with and without mnp are QUITE different - since MNP is an
error correcting protocol - it prevents you from seeing the little
glitches if there are any - the modems "talk to each other" until they
get it right, before showing it to you.
 Hopefully we'll get our 9600 back and the line noise problem will
clear up. (It sure will for those of us that use MNP, heh heh).
 BTW could you turn off CAPS? my weak ole eyes prefer normal lower case
(grin)

Msg 42630 is 28 line(s) on 10/16/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to LEO ANGEVINE re: R/HELLO

 >> Will an XT be fast enough for midi?
 Heck, yes - I'm using one (actually, A PC Portable, which is somewhat
ideal because the built-in screen allows it to be conveniently placed
right in the keyboard rack) and it is a simple 4.77mhz machine. There
are those who say nothing short of a multi-tasking, presentation-manager
based OS/2 system is suitable for MIDI - but I say to them that my own
priorities aren't like that.
 You could most certainly make "backgrounds" for use with your guitar.
 What I did for one of my first "hack" things was to to lay down a simple
R&R bass line, then add some drums, then come back with an electric
guitar, then some "aahhh" voices, etc - made a "cute" Rock & Roll tune-
though without more practice it sounded kind of like some 8th graders
in their garage doing their first band (grin).
 >> Separate computer for midi? Shop for a midi system?
 Depends. if the computer is close enough to the synths, then younts,
don't need a separate one. However, I, for example, have my midi rack
in the living room, far away from other computer systems. I specifically
bought the portable for MIDI use. You could get a cheap XT clone, as
your midi system. You don't "shop" for a midi system. You buy an
MPU-401 type card (roland) or its newer all-in-one card, then you have a
world of software open to you. You have to decide what your final budget
is - or how far you're willing to stretch it. $250 is typical (or higher)
for good MIDI software, though "Cakewalk" is less expensive than that.
 >> I'd really enjoy having an orchestra in my livingroom.
 Well, remember, YOU - YOU have to play 'em all! Are you up to that?
Have you ever "scored" a piece for an orchestra? Or do you know where
you can get the "conductor's score" that has all instruments in it? I'd
like to go that way.

Msg 42633 is 16 line(s) on 10/17/89 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to MARTIN SCHRADER re: R/DISK MANGLER & BIG DRIVES

More stuff re: Disk Mangler.I've remembered a couple other things
which may halp explain DM's problems with large &/or SCSI drives.
Some mfr.s use "sector translation" to interface with large drives.
I'm not sure exactly how this works, but it seems to involve a
'remapping' of physical disk sectors, clusters, etc. at runtime.
Perhaps CDC does something like this (or DOESN'T do it), with
the result that programs like DM get bamboozled. Also, I use
an app. called VM/386 for multitasking and their doc.s state
repeatedly that with certain large drives (i.e. > 1024 cylinder)
the file-sharing subsystem of their program won't work properly,
nor will the internal disk-caching routines.
 The upshot is that all the discussion seems to indicate that
something about unusual cluster sizes, # of disk cylinders, or
the like, screws up DM. BTW, I haven't noticed any performance
penalty on my system.

to RICHARD GOZDAL re: FOR SALE

If you still have that power supply for sale, the COPH-2 BBS might be
interested in it; seems as if some of what appear to be disk problems
may actually be power problems. Also, if you still have TP 5.0 for
sale, I'd be personally interested.

Msg 42635 is 06 line(s) on 10/18/89 from JACK HOMA
to ALL re: COMPAQ 386S & WINDOWS 286

Has anyone had any experience installing Windows 286 with the Compaq 386s
and being able to access the extra memory that comes on the mother board?
It appears that Compaq's CEMM.EXE memory manager is not compatible with
Windows. Microsoft doesn't know the answer other than the need LIM 4.0
to see the memory. Compaq says that CEMM.EXE is LIM 4.0 compatible.
Any answers?

 You missed the TP V5 by 1 hour (going to Springfield). Which
power supply you want, the good or bad one? Both avail. Sell or
trade. what did I ask for it, $35? 775-2593 4-9 PM, all day

 Anyone but FormWorx (and Fill & File) and find out they don't want it?
 I am looking for a cheaper than new copy. $119 is a little high for
a few forms with this pgm. I just like the small print capabilities
and printer drivers.
