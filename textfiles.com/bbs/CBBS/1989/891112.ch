Msg 42745 is 22 line(s) on 11/11/89 from BILL WOLFF
to MIKE KAVADIAS re: R/HELP WITH BELL ON LINE NOISE

I have seen docs on BBS's which deal with the subject, and which I have
been meaning to download and never do? The ones I have seen have been
in Champaign/Urbana area. I am sure they are here too. But I can not
recall right now.

I have been in BBS work for years and one of the most troublesome thing
to happen is line noise. What's worse, is nobody fares very well when
it comes to helping you out.

Since I work in electronics and do a lot of engineering. I can say that
a filter will help! But what kind of filter you ask? Well you have to
taylor it to your system to work the best. This is a tough one to call
from here.

What's even worse with line noise, is some BBSers are not even plaged
with the problem. I have found out for some strange reason my CP/M
and Commodore computers are worse than my MS-DOS computers. Modems
doesn't seem to be a factor in my case. I have switched them all
around. I help this helps in any case! <BW>

P.S. It also appears to happen more when BBSsing on a board that
supports 9600 baud and you are using 1200 or 2400 baud.

Msg 42747 is 05 line(s) on 11/12/89 from JIM SACKETT
to ALL re: BIOS DATE HELP

I know I have the minimum date requirements for BIOS to support 3 1/2"
diskette drives somewhere but I can't find it. Recently someone I know
asked me what was the minimum date BIOS they needed so they could install
a 720K drive on their system with 3.3 DOS.
 Thanks Jim Sackett

Msg 42748 is 28 line(s) on 11/12/89 from BOB COVELL
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: CP/M:RAD. SHAK MOD II:BBS

To All:

I am trying to find a suitable BBS program that will run on a Radio Shack
Model II in conjunction with two 8 inch drives and one Corvus 20MG hard
disk. I have several types of external modems. The school's IBM PC with
external 20MG hard disk crashed and we have not been able to fix it yet.
The Model II happens to be the only computer not in use at this time and I
need to get my "two-week old" BBS back up and running.

I am presently working on two projects with this BBS:
 1. joining 8 campuses together for a junior college by computer
 2. completing my master's degree practicum

My funds are limited to what I can afford personnally and a stipend of $250
from the college. I was using RBBS ver 13 and was thinking about installing
version 17 which I just acquired. Probably, if there is a CP/M version of
RBBS or something similiar, it might be the best situation for now and in
the future, should this happen again.

I'll check back with this BBS occasionally to see if there are any
solutions. My list of phone numbers are:
 1. school: (616) 924-5480
 2. home : (616) 937-4267
 3. home : (517) 887-1573
 I travel around a lot to several locations, so if you try to contact me,
 please leave me a message so I can call you back.
