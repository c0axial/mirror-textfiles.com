to MARTY DIPPEL re: R/CBBS HARDWARE

Oops, I see I'm getting a line hit now and then, too!
 Ya, it is removed from the "plywood board". Dunno why.
Gee, I'm getting VERY bad line noise! Back to the MNP 9600 soon,
I hope!

Msg 42003 is 10 line(s) on 07/02/89 from PETE RETZBACH
to ALL re: TERMINAL HELP

would like some help with new equipment . I have a leading edge model d
with dual 5.25s and a hu2400s modem . the PROCOMM 2.4 terminal pckgd with
the modem doesnt seem to want to log on . it will dial just fine but
does not seem to recognize the carrier . all hardware functions seem fine
Im pretty sure it's the software .
Would appreciate any tips on how I could get the software to recognize
carrier and log on .
My technical prowess is limited and I would appreciate any help anyone can
give me.
Thank you in advance for your aid

Msg 42004 is 03 line(s) on 07/02/89 from RICHARD HINTON
to ALL re: BBS NUMBERS.

I am looking for the Spitire BBS directory in the Chicago area,
among others. Is there a central place for listing of various
BBS's around the Chicago area? Thanks.

Msg 42005 is 07 line(s) on 07/02/89 from ANTHONY TAM
to RICHARD HINTON re: R/BBS NUMBERS.

In response to your inquiry about the Spitfire BBS directory in Chicago, I
think the number is (312)768-5853, the TOP GUN BBS. I'm not really sure about
it, but give it a try, and as for a central place for BBS's, I think you
will find it in the number above. I don't know about you, but I seem to have
been encountering sporadic line noise every 3-5 days or so. It's annoying to
say the least. I hope I've been of assistance. Drop me a line if I'm right.
Otherwise, I apologize for straining you eyes on one mediocre message.
