Msg 41520 is 18 line(s) on 03/20/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to MIKE ANDREWS re: CBBS 9600

 Just ensuring you saw the msg - it seems to work fine. The output
seems quite a bit slower than I'd think it should be, but that may be
due to the slow CGA scrolling on the PC, which is duplicating the CBBS
output - I've always had CBBS run - no matter what machine - with both
the remote user, and the local system 'active' (keyboard & screen).
 Thanks again for the modems - seems to be working quite nicely, but
I have one 'bug' to get around where I can't exit to DOS - probably the
interrupt driven routine is at fault.
 P.S. I was at a customer today and they had just put in a P.O for
some UDS 4800 baud modems. I recommended they support a local company
and go 9600 for about the same money - they are going to do so and go with
HST modems.
 P.S. REAL minor point, but when entering CBBS msgs, I think it looks
nicer with a couple-space indent on paragraphs rather than a blank line-
that way the blank lines are nicely MESSAGE separators, not PARAGRAPH
separators - but then everyone accuses me of trying to pack too much into
too little space (grin).
 P.S. Don't leave Chicago!

Msg 41521 is 24 line(s) on 03/20/89 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: CBBS INTERRUPTS

One comment: Some years ago, I elected to allow CBBS to use CONTROL
CHARACTER functions - ^K to abort, ^C to cancel the current typing,
^S to suspend/start output - which could be done WITHOUT holding down
the control key. What this means is that all the time CBBS is typing
to you, it is also looking for any characters. This means that CBBS
doesn't have "typeahead" in quite the same degree that DOS or other
BBSs might have.
 However, when intputting messages, it turns out that when printing
the line numbers and the space and the ? for line input, I DON'T CHECK
for these characters, which means you can send a C/R and immediately
start typing.
 So, what it really means is that while reviewing a msg, you cannot
start typing the next command.
 Experiment with it - I'm sure you'll find it a lot more friendly
than it was before for power typing in msgs.
 Also, if you go into message entry, then before typing anything, you
press return to go to the message-entry sub-menu, you can then type the
W command to go into auto word wrap mode. Then type C to go back to
message entry ("C"ontinue input is what it stands for).
 Those of you who want to be CBBS `jocks' can take the shortcut of
pressing return, then typing w;c<enter> rather than w<enter>c<enter>
(gee, minor point - just showing how multiple commands can usually be
stacked with ; delimiters).
 Enjoy. Comment. Feedback. (via the (G)ood bye command)

to BILL WOLFF re: R/CP/M BASIC COMPILER

Much of the software for the Osborne 1 is on single-density disks,
which the Commodore 128 can't read (at least last time I checked).
Also, a lot of the major applications for the O-1 were sold "pre-installed"
without the usual setup programs, meaning you're going to be limited
to a 52-character display.
I had similar experiences to yours with BASCOM, MU-MATH and Milestone.
I could read them on a Kaypro 10 using MFDISK, but the executable files
seemed to contain errors.

Msg 41523 is 04 line(s) on 03/21/89 from ED FOSTER
to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/DISK

Glad to hear you fixed the problem. I will have to look at
Paradox, since I haven't found anything that will materially
slow down a superstation. Does Paradox have a TSR that does
processing on the superstation?

Msg 41524 is 07 line(s) on 03/21/89 from TIMOTHY GRIFFIN
to ALL re: MIDIEX FORMAT

I downloaded some new sounds for my Kawai
K1 keyboard the other day, noting that they are in a MIDIEX format.
This is not a format I am familiar with. What routines or special
software do I need to load these to my keyboard? Is this is
proprietary format, or industry standard? I own the Music Quest
MCC-1 Co-processor card and the new K1 Editor Librarian for the
XT system (from Sound Quest). Can anyone give me a little guidance?

Msg 41525 is 07 line(s) on 03/21/89 from BILL WOLFF
to MIKE ANDREWS re: R/CP/M BASIC COMPILER

Mike, I called PDSC and told them what you said. They said they knew
that and patched the Osborne version to work with most CP/M computers.
They said it sounds like I got the unpatched type, which they have a
few of those too. They said for me to send it back and they will
replace it with a working one. So far I bought about $150 worth of
software from these folks and really liked the support from them.
Thanks again for coming to my rescue, Mike!

Msg 41526 is 22 line(s) on 03/21/89 from BILL WOLFF
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/CP/M BASIC COMPILER

Yes, you are right about Osborne software is on single-density disks.
But I also have an Osborne Executive that can read SD Software.
Remember that if you buy Osborne Exective software, it comes DD
format. But only single-sided.

Having a Commodore 128 and reading many different disk formats is a
real plus. But reading SD disks is not one of them. I am glad there
isn't much SD formats around. Except bargans on Osborne One software.
Yep, I was just in Silicon Valley and found a store selling all the
neat things from the late 70's and early 80's. There I found some
Osborne Software for $5.00 each. Disk Doctor and Milestone. I don't
know what I'll use Milestone for, but I had a great use for Disk
Doctor. So far it won't install. I am trying it a the Osborne
Executive first. If I get it to work there, then will try it on the
Commodore. In fact, that's where I picked up my Osborne Executive for
$150.00 plus software including Uniform for the IBM. I have used it
and it's real nice, but using Trans128 (a PD program) I can read and
format IBM stuff. The format doesn't work right, at least not on my
drive A:. But using IBM pre-formatted disks, it works fine.

What is MFDISK? Is it PD? Or how much does it cost? How many formats
does it handle?

to ALL re: EXTRA CHARACTERS FOR FREE!

Has anyone have been having trouble with this board getting random
characters at the prompts or message editor? It works fine at 300 baud
but not 1200 baud. All other BBS I have used is fine except for one which
I always had trouble on at 1200. I fine tuned the baud rate and it
helps, but doesn't stop it completely. This is running on a Commodore
128 both in native and CP/M modes with a BSR modem. And it use to work
fine with this board.

to ALL re: R/EXTRA CHARACTERS FOR FREE!

Well I just a few minutes ago signed on with my Epson Geneva and
had the same problems as with the Commodore. But I have only one
1200 baud modem guys. I also log on to another board and no prob-
lems at all. I think maybe Ward's modem is going down the tubes or
a noisy phone line. I know what that is like. Cleaning all the con-
tacts to the inside phone line. I have about 5 plugs to there
from my modem. Hope this helps. It would be strange if it's just me!

to BOB AXEL re: NEXT CACHE MEETING

Bob: The next CACHE meeting will be on Sunday April 16th at the DeVry
Institute of Technology in Chicago, 3300 N. Campbell (1 block North of
Belmont and 1 block west of Western). Special Interest Groups begin
meeting as early as 10:00 am (notably IBM, which has two groups, intro
and advanced). The main meeting is at 1:00 pm - I believe Peter Hru is
giving a presentation on personal activity managers. More SIG meetings in
the afternoon (notable Unix/C). Hope all this helps. Sorry, you just
missed the last meeting on Sunday March 19th. See you next month.
Please <K>ill this message. Thanks.

to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

I received your program listing today in the mail. It looks like it
will fill my requirement exactly. Can't wait to compile it!
I was able to get around this immediate problem by other means, but this
program will give me control of the global environment, which DOS sorely
lacks. And here I thought you said you were normally slow to mail things!
I'm amazed to find it at my doorstep tonight.

Thanks for your trouble, Eric.

Msg 41533 is 07 line(s) on 03/21/89 from MARTY DIPPEL
to JERRY OLSEN re: R/ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

Thanks for the offer, Jerry, but Eric has already mailed the program to
me. It's about 5 pages (or so) of C source, so it won't be just too
terribly difficult to type in manually. The biggest problem here at
home is that I don't have a computer, believe it or not.
I plan to get one soon, but have been "planning to get one soon" now
for quite some time. Thanks for the generous offer, though. I'll give
the Advocate a call; never called it before.
