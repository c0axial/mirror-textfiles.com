to JIM SACKETT re: R/INFO ON DTP

Your problem is that you're using a "high end" printer (the rented HP)
with a "low end" publishing package.
 I may be generalizing, but "low end" publishing packages work quite
hard to do well with inexpensive dot matrix printers, while "high end"
publishing packages (PageMaker, Ventura) don't "bother" with low-end
printers, concentrating on using all the features of the "high end"
printers.
 I use PageMaker and a Deskjet at home and with a PostScript printer
at work.
 For those times that I need larger fonts (than the 14 point supported
by the font cartridges) at home, I bought a copy of Corel Draw, which
has a lot of nice fonts that you export in WMF (Windows Meta File) format
to PageMaker.
 PageMaker, Windows, Corel Draw, HP Desk Jet, and a couple font carts
(Times Roman, Helvetica, both in the efficient "ascii" versions) make
a nice publishing system.
 Ventura has some strengths compared to PM, such as larger doc's,
lower overhead, etc.
 But (heh heh) if you get PageMaker, you'll find more help here.

 Sorry, you're out of luck.
 Com1 and com3 use the same interrupt, only the port base changes.
 With Com1 and Com2, the interrupt changes, so it is MUCH more
complex to patch (I've never been successful, since it becomes
a need to search for things like various hex bits being put out
certain ports, etc.

Here in Orange Calif., computer club members were offered
Prodigy free for 6 months. I tried it and found it so
poor comapred to the BBS systems I am used to that I
never used it more than 2 or 3 times. Response time
was terribly slow, the graphic screens mean the information
content is tiny compared to the info content on a text
screen and the advertisments that keep flashing up are
a pain in the xxx. I wouldn't recommend it.

 Hey that's pretty good, getting to use P-Y [how are we going to abbreviate
this one!?] for free for 90 days. Any more free kits available? I am
going to Sears today to try to get one a regular kit. For E-mail alone
it could revolutionize personal computing. IBM and Sears have probably
hit upon an instant winner. The time is right in terms of people with
computers wanting to inter-communicate across the USA and lets hope the
entire globe. CIS is fine for technical areas and special forums but
for John Q. Public he wants to write to more general areas-like to
CBS for not keeping his favorite sitcom on, etc.

James, it has occured to me MANY times. I have had this HD for many years,
and i get the messages once in a while. I have found out that it usually
happens when I either turn off or Ctrl-Alt-Delete When my HD is STILL
rotating. When i return to using the comuter, the heads probably need to
go to their original position or somethand they cannot do it in the
time need to do the POST. The only way i can fix it is to do a warmboot t
and then the drive corrects itself. If you need a good book on ERROR MESS
AGES, contact Peter Norton, or get his book on Errors from a local bookstore
the book is written in plain English, so if you don't understand COmputer
Jive, this book w{ll help.

to BILL WOLFF re: R/VM/386

thanks for the addnl. info-no need to look up anything. I'm fairly
familiar w/ the standards problem. My current difficulties stem
from the fact that 2 prog.s running simultaneously often try to
grab video memory other prog.s need to be using. The prime offenders
seem to be wp applications such as wordperfect and m-soft word.
if either is run in a virtual machine which is linked only to a
Hercules monitor, they still corrupt VGA address space! IGC says
the wp prog.s must be trying to use some of it for their graphics
modes.
 Any ideas on how to tell such a prog to leave certain address
ranges alone? Any text mode program runs fine on the Hercules, w/o
corrupting any VGA memory.
 Thanks for the info.

Msg 42396 is 20 line(s) on 08/28/89 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to ALL re: WP AND VIDEO MEMORY ADDRESSES

I'm running into an odd (or perhaps not so odd) problem with
wordperfect and its use of video memory. Here's the situation
I'm running all my apps under VM/386, which sets up independent
virtual machines which share a standard DOS file system and i/o
channels. Each vm runs its own copy of dos, has its own config
files, etc.
 What's happening is that everything works fine unless I
try to run WordPerfect (or Microsoft Word, for that matter) in
a vm which is linked only to the Hercules video (also have
a VGA video attached to the hardware, but not linked to the WP
virtual machine). When i start up WP, it somehow appropriates
some of the video addresses used by the VGA, thus corrupting the
VGA display. This corruption continues even after WP has been
exited, and if I attempt to reboot one of the VGA vms, the whole
system crashes and needs a cold boot!
 Any ideas on how I can get these WP programs to leave
a specified address range alone? BTW I'm fine for now, running
WP on VGA and other, text mode programs on the Herc. causes no
conflicts.
 Any help would bgreatly appreciated!

to RICHARD HINTON re: WP50 AND EXT RAM

If you have expanded RAM (in the case of an AT, extended RAM - You'll need
a LIM 4.0 driver - PC Magazine had a half way decent one a few months
back), you can specify Word Pe]+~fect with a /R option
C:\WP50> WP /R - This will load all of Word Perfect into the expanded RAM
provided that you have enough. One of the management staff at work runs
a Word Perfect she{ll that will allow him to transfer multiple files
from expanded RAM to DOS RAM and swap between them. Unfortunately, WP50 is
larger than what 1 Meg will give you in expanded (WP50 is about 370K), the
extra 384K is not large enough after the LIM 4.0 driver!. Hope this
helps.

 I ran an ad in the Trib classified and had a few EXTRA calls for a
Tandy CM-11 monitor. If you want to get rid of one, the going
price is $190 (minus 5 for me). I will let the customers call you.
I paid $21 for the ad so want something! Might be able to satisfy
ONE customer with a GOOD CGA monitor (less than $190).
 More than the going price on the BBSs.

is a mem expansion board needed? Have a customer for this also (chips
or board and chips).
