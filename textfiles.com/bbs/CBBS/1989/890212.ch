You can sell a copyright regardless of whether that copyright is registered.
In terms of what can be copyrighted (regardless of whether it's registered)
it's basically a matter of whether the code is original. This can apply
to source code for a complete program, to portions of it, or a collection
of programs.

I don't know what you read about submitting copies. I do know that perfs and
page numbers don't matter. You need to submit either the entire code or the
first fifty pages. The code should be in a form that easily identifies you as
the author;i.e.; you should have the copyright notice in obvious places. It is
best if you submit the source, but if you are fearful of theft, you can submit
a copy of the machine code. The machine code still should have your copyright
notice embedded in ascii format. The source code is better if a question
arises over authorship. Correction to the above "first fifty pages". It
should be first 25 and last 25 pages.

I agree that registering a copyright is not required to claim authorship.
Registering a copyright does aid in claiming authorship and affords the
opportunity of getting monetary damages. Who is to know if a program takes
off. Maybe its better lock the barn before the critters are stolen. Anyway
it purely a matter of personal preference as to registering copyrights. As
I said before, many authors and corporations do it as a matter of form.
One further comment. It was a copyright registration that made Phil Katz stop
selling PKARC and settle damages.

I have just finished the adventure game KINGS QUEST 4. I would like to know if
there are other adventure games with same level of graphics and sound. Also,
are there games which are more challenging?

I'm in need of the command list for an anchor signalman mark ii modem
especially the originate command needed when a mainframe dial back system
calls you back and the modem needs to be reset to originate

With legal fees as they are, I would consider it BEST to get a copyright on
software. It isn't all that difficult and DO believe it could save a heck of a
lot of money and time if a problem arises. There isn't any excuse for being
DUMB and taken advantage of when the job is so simple. I am sure any court
waould think so also and give a lot of feedback. Still tink it is best to play
it safe.

You are supposed to leave some space at the top and bottom. I guess that is
for micro filming it. The fifty pages is IF it is 50 pages or less otherwise
it is the first 25 and last 25 pages.
