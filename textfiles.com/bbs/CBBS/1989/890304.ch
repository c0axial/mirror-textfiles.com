If Northbrook is in your calling area you may find (312)272 5912
just what you are looking for.

Msg 41431 is 21 line(s) on 03/03/89 from MIKE ANDREWS
to ALL re: CBBS IN THE SMITHSONIAN UPDATE

An update on the project to get Ward and Randy's the original
CBBS #1 microcomputer hardware into The Smithsonian Institution
for permanent display:

One of our CFOG members, Murray Mathesen is an expert in photographic
restoration and has worked with the Smithsonian. When he got the word
through Carson Wilson, he called his contact there.

The fellow at The Smithsonian was, more than slightly interested,
"you mean it's THE FIRST BBS computer?!". He is spreading the word
through the Washington bureaucracy. We will hear the details on
submission soon.

It looks like it's gonna happen!

Stay tuned here for more details. Updates will be posted on:
 CBBS #1 - (312) 545-8086
 Chinet - (312) 283-0559
 Antelope Freeway RAS - (312) 764-5162
 All are 300/1200/2400 baud.

to MIKE ANDREWS re: CBBS IN THE SMITHSONIAN UPDATE

Hi Mike:
 I am one of the early Altair guys along with Ward and many others.
I purchased the S100 modem board from Randy that handled the first
50,000 or so calls to CBBS when it first started. It is a board I used
for quite a while myself, and a PRIZED possesion of mine. If you feel
the Smithsonian project would like to have the ORIGINAL CBBS S100 modem
board back, please let me know. I would consider donating it to the
Smithsonian. Please call me at (wk) 312-454-8025 if interested.
 Roger

Thanks, Tracy! Will give it a try.not much luck in calling other local
boards today.sigh. Take care.Kathleen

Msg 41434 is 04 line(s) on 03/03/89 from KATHLEEN MARTIN
to ALEX ZELL re: R/ANOTHER BBS

And also thanks to you, Alex! No, Northbrook is not local to Park Ridge,
but after today's slim pickings in calling various boards (from no answer
to being inexplicably kicked off), I just may have to spend some phone
bucks to find what I want.take care.Kathleen

What you need are 256k 100ns or less chips about $13 - 15 ea

Msg 41436 is 09 line(s) on 03/04/89 from JERRY OLSEN
to KATHLEEN MARTIN re: R/LOCAL BBS #S

Ward's suggestion of starting by determining exchanges which are local to
you is a good one. With such a list at hand, you might want to call a BBS
here in the central Chicago area (local to you, I think) and use the SEARCH
program's "BBS List" function, which searches several BBS lists (including
one a little more recent than that currently on-line here). Enter one of
the exchanges to the "Search for?" prompt. Enter the other exchanges to
succeeding "Or?" prompts. Press ONLY Return to the "And?" prompts.This
will search ALL lists for ALL exchanges you specify simultaneously. Hope
it helps.The Advocate/NOWAR, 312.939.4411, 24 hrs., 8/n/1.

Hi, Ward.I must say, your BBS software looks quite interesting. I don't
think I've ever seen anything like it!

Msg 41438 is 02 line(s) on 03/04/89 from BOB SULLIVAN

Yes, I do some programming, etc. for students. Does the ICE have a newsletter?
I am interested in getting more information.

Msg 41439 is 03 line(s) on 03/04/89 from TRENT CASTLE
to ALL re: XMODEM

Looking for the source code for xmodem written in asembler and pascal.
Would also like literature search telling where i could read in english
a complete enough description of the protocal to completely understand.

Msg 41440 is 05 line(s) on 03/04/89 from MIKE ANDREWS
to ROGER HALE re: R/CBBS IN THE SMITHSONIAN UPDA

Roger, we DEFINITELY want your modem for submission!
I've asked Randy to get the rest of the original hardware from his ex.
(I've heard that the monitor is holding up the water heater in the basement.)
I'll give you a call to make arrangements. We want to get the machine in
as original condition as possible. (Maybe even working.)

Msg 41441 is 05 line(s) on 03/04/89 from MIKE ROSE
to CLIFF SHARP re: R/V20 AT 8 MHZ

I've been using a 8mHz V20 in my 8mHz XT clone for over a year now with
no problems or incompatabilities now. I really doubt the chip is
sensitive. I know you get a data book about the V20 series and I've two
files on use of the V20 for 8080 mode-I'll look to see if it says anythin
anything about a clock problem.
