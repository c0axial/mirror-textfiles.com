  TO: DAVE CAULKINS
SUBJ: ATLANTA CBBS
  
      DAVE, I DO NOT HAVE THE NUMBER OF ATLANTA CBBS.  I HAVE
      TALKED WITH DENNIS HAYES, AND DON HYDE (WHO IS DOING THE
      PROGRAMMING). THEY ARE USING DON'S DEVELOPMENT MACHINE
      FOR THE CBBS, SO IT'S HOURS ARE NOT FIXED.  I SUGGEST YOU 
      CALL THEM AT (404) 455-7663 AND GET THE LATEST, OR, IF I 
      REMEMBER, I WILL ASK FOR IT WHEN I CALL, WHICH I DO 
      FREQUENTLY. SORRY FOR NOT ANSWERING SOONER.

      P.S. THE ZIP CODE FOR CHICAGO IS WRONG ON THE CBBS
      CALIFORNIA.  46304 IS CHESTERTON, INDIANA, INTERESTINGLY 
      ENOUGH THE PLACE WHERE I CALL YOU FROM.  I WONDER IF GRAGG 
      DID A ZIP-TO-CITY SEARCH FROM MY CALL TO HIM, AND PUT THE 
      ZIP DOWN.  ANYWAY, IT IS 60613.  
 
      P.S. ALSO, HOW ABOUT A 'CREDIT' LINE FOR RANDY AND I
      IN YOUR CBBS?

SUBJ: HELLO FROM SEATTLE

      I AM A MEMBER OF THE NORTHWEST COMPUTER CLUB. JUST
      FOUND OUT ABOUT YOUR NEAT SYSTEM FROM HOMEBREW N/L
      AND WROTE AN ARTICLE ON IT FOR OUR N/L. WE HAVE
      A SIMILAR CAPABILITY ON A LOCAL TIMESHARE SYSTEM,
      BUT NOT PUBLIC. I AM AMAZED THAT YOU CAN GET SO MUCH
      THRUPUT ON ONE PHONE LINE! LOTS OF SUCCESS.


FEEDACK FROM HENRY HILLBRATH:

      YOUR MODEM DOSEN'T WANT TO TALK TO SOME OR OF OUR 
      MODEMS BUT OTHER THAN THAT YOUR SYSTEM WORKS GREAT.
      I SEE FORM READING SOME MORE MESSAGES THAT YOU ARE
      HAVING THRUPUT PROBLEMS. WE ARE PRINTING YOUR NUMBER HOPE
      IT DOSEN'T MESS YOU UP TOO MUCH. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOUR
      SYSTEM DO WELL. LOTS OF LUCK.

FEEDBACK FROM TOM ROOT:

      VERY INTERESTING SYSTEM....MY COUSIN LARRY ROOT TOLD ME
      ABOUT IT, AND I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA. DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA
      THAT 'AMATEURS' COULD BE DOING STUFF LIKE THIS.  HE ALSO TELLS 
      ME THAT THERE ARE SIMILAR SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA AND ATLANTA, 
      AS WELL AS SEATTLE.  SUPER GREAT. 

      I PROBABLY WON'T GET INTO THIS SYSTEM VERY OFTEN.  AM USING

SUBJ: SYNCHRONOUS PROTOCOLS

      REGARDS YOUR MSG (193),
      THE SYNCHRONOUS MODENM DOES THE DATA RATE CLOCKING.
      THE 8251 COMMUNICATIONS CONTROLLER CHIP REQUIRES
      A SYNCH MODEM IN SYNCH MODE. DATA RATES FOR
      SYNCH XMISSION ARE FROM 1200 BAUD TO OVER 
      50 KB! YOU CAN GO UP TO 2400 BAUD ON VOICE GRADE
      PHONE LINES. SYNCH XMITS D8 BIT BYTES WITH A FEW
      FRAMING CHARACTERS: I.E. 1 OR 2 SYNCH CHARS;
      STX, 2 POLLING CHARS FOR ADDRESSING, ETX AND 
      A CHECKSUM. SYNCH WOULD BE GOOD FOR BATCHED
      MESSAGES BETWEEN NETWORK NODES, TIEING UP
      PHONES LINES FOR LESS TIME, SAVING MONEY.
      ALSO MICRO COMPUTERS THAT TALK BISYNC ARE
      POTENTIAL PRODUCTS TO SMALL BUSINESSES.
      CHEAPER THAN IBM !

      WE COULD USE BISYNC TO PERMIT VARIOUS CBBS TO PASS MSGS
      BETWEEN EACH OTHER.

SUBJ: CORRECTING MISTAKES

      "..AND LOOK AT THE WAY MY NAME WENT IN..."  ???
      THAT IS WHY CONTROL-R EXISTS.  WHEN YOU TYPE YOUR NAME
      (OR ANYTHING YOU WANT TO GO INTO THE SYSTEM CORRECTLY)
      AND YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE GLITCHED, TYPE CONTROL-R, 
      WHICH WILL ECHO THE ENTIRE LINE BACK TO YOU.  IF IT IS
      INCORRECT, USE EITHER DEL OR CONTROL-U TO CORRECT IT.
      ...AS TO THE ECHO SPEED, IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT WE, I 
      BEGAN TO THINK THAT PERHAPS WE EXECUTE A LOT OF 
      INSTRUCTIONS FROM TIME IN, TO TIME OUT,BUT LOOKED, AND 
      IT IS ONLY ABOUT 50 OR SO.  YOU HAVE ME PUZZLED.  AS TO 
      YOUR CONNECTION TO US, WE ADMIT TO NOT HAVING THE BEST 
      MODEM MONEY CAN BUY, ONLY ONE WHICH IS REASONABLE IN COST
      IN KEEPING WITH THE OVERALL GOALS (BOTH COST AND FUNCTION)
      OF THIS SYSTEIM.  WE WILL BE TRYING A NEWER REVISION HAYES 
      MODEM SHORTLY (HAYES SAYS PAPERWORK IS DONE, SHOULD BE 
      SHIPPED SOON).  SORRY.  IF NOT SATISFACTORY DON'T USE
      THE SYSTEM.

      CALIFORNIA, IT WAS DONE TO SHOW OUR SUPPORT FOR THE INTENSE
      EFFORT GOING INTO PCNET. 


FEEDBACK FROM WARD CHRISTENSEN:

     JUST RAN INTO GLITCH WHEREBY LOWER CASE CHARS WERE NOT
     ACCEPTED. I SAID 'SAVE 40 BADUC526.COM'.  HOW ABOUT GETTING

DATE: 05/27/78
  TO: MR. CHRISTENSEN
SUBJ: CBBS SOFTWARE 

      WARD, ARE THERE ANY PLANS TO HAVE A UNIFIED NETWORK?
      I MEAN SEPARATE NETWORK UNITS WHICH CALL EACH OTHER UP
      TO SEND EACH ONE MESSAGES?  ONE SYSTEM COULD SEND TO
      ANOTHER NOT TOO FAR AWAY (LESS PHONE BILL).  THEY PROBAB-
      LY CALL EACH OTHER UP TO TRANSFER MESS. AT OFF HOURS.
      ANOTHER QUESTION, WHEN I WAS TALKING TO THE SYSTEM IN
      CALIFORNIA THE OPERATOR WAS TALKING BACK ONLY HE SAID
      HIS MESSAGE WAS TRANSPARENT TO THE SYSTEM.  HOW DID YOU
      DO THAT?  

      RESPECTFULLY,  STEVE WALK


[ Ward Christensen Breaks into Chat Mode ]

- HI FROM WARD 
  SAW YOUR MSG -  
  THE CALIF SYSTEM TYPED TO YU BY SIMPLEY HAVING HIS KEYBOARD 
  GO DIRECTLY TO THE MODEM, NOT TO ANY PROGRAM (I.E. BULLETIN 
  BOARD/OR ANYTHING). AS TO NETWORKING, THIS SYSTEM IS SIMPLE.
  PCNET IS DOING THE FANCY STUFF.  WELL LEAVE THAT FOR THEM.  
  OVER

- YOU SCARED ME I THOUGHT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE SYSTEM 
  WHEN YOU CAME ON

- HA HA

- DO YOU HAVE ANY NUMBERS FOR THE PCNET?

- NO, BUT WOULDN'T HELP ANYWAY WITHOUT THEIR V-E-R-Y 
  COMPLEX SOFTWWARE. OVER

- DO YOU MEAN ALL THEIR PROTOCAL?  OVER

- ALL?  DON'T UNDERSTAND.

- I THOUGHT THEY HAVE A STRICT SYNTAX FOR MESSAGES OVER

- YES.  HAIRY HANDSHAKING IN 'RADIX 41' THEN WHEN BOTH SIDES 
  AGREE, THEY GO TO FULL 8 BIT OVER

- WHAT IS 'RADIX 41' OVER

- IT'S A WAY TO SEND 8 BIT DATA VALUES (2 BYTES, AS A 3 BYTE 
  PRINTABLE VALUE, FOR COMMUNICATING WITH COMPUTERS WHICH 
  DON'T HAVE FULL 8 BIT CAPABILITIES, SUCH AS A BZ...BASIC-ONLY 
  SYSTEM.  OVER 

- THAT SOUNDS NEAT.  WHAT COURSES DO YOU RECOMMEND IN COLLEGE ABOUT 
  COMPUTERS?  I AM ENROLLED AT IIT OVER

- DON'T KNOW.  COMPUTER SSCIENCE NOT INVENTED WHEN I WENT 10 YEARS 
  AGO...O V E R.

- HOW WAS THE LAST CACHE MEETING. I WENT ON A CANOE TRIP
  OVER

- NO MEAT.  JUST NON-TECHNICAL ON RADIO SHACK, 
  BUT THEN A TECHNICAL ONE ON THE 6800 INSTRUCTION SET

- WELL, I GOTTA GO.  WORKING ON HEATHKIT 2 METER SYSTEM.  
  RANDY BUGGING ME TO GET GOING.  BYE..

- THANKS FOR TALKING TO ME.  TALK TO YOU LATER.
