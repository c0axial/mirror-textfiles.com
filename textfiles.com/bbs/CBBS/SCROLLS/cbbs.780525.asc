IN YOUR CBBS?  ()OR WHAT IT AT THE END OF THE WELCOME, WHICH

MR. CHRISTENSEN/CBBS SOFTWARE/Y//N/  WARD, ARE THERE ANY PLANS TO HAVE
 A UNIFIED NETWORK?/I MEAN SEPARATE NETWORUNITS WHICH CALL EACH OTHER
UP/TO SEND EACH _ ON MESSAGES?  ONE SYSTEM COULD SEND TO
ANOTHER NOT TOO FAR AWAY (LESS PHONE BILL).  THEY PROBAB-
LY CALL EACH OTHER UP TO TRANSFER MESS. AT OFF HOURS.
ANOTHER QUESTION, WHEN I WAS TALKING TO THE SYSTEM IN
CALIFORNIA THE OPERATOR WAS TALKING BACK ONLY HE SAID
HIS MESSAGE WAS TRANSPARENT TO THE SYSTEM.  HOW DID YOU
DO THAT?  /         [THERE IS NO PASSWORD ON THIS MESSAGE]
     RESPECTFULLY,  STEVE WALK//L//L/1/S
R;228;227;226;225//G/// //////HI FROM WARD
//SAW YOUR MSG - /THE CALIF SYSTEM TYPED TO YU BY SIMPLEY

THAT FOR THEM.  OVER/YOU SCARED ME I THOUGHT SOME THING
WAS WRONG WITH THE SYSTEM WHEN YOU CAM ON
DHOA HYAOU HAVE ANY NUMBERS FOR THE PCNET?
OYNOEYRLDH////NO, BUT WOULDN'T HELP ANYWAY WITHOUT THERI...THEIR
V-E-R-Y COMPLEX SOFTWWARE. OVER/,DO YOU MEAN ALL THEIR PROTOCAL?
OVER/ALL?  DON'T UNDERSTAND./I THOUGHT THEY HAVE A STRICT SYNTAX FOR M
ESSAGES OVER/YES.  HAIRY HANDSHAKING IN 'RADIX 41' THEN WHEN BOTH
SIDES AF..AGREE, THEY GO TO FULL 8 BIT OVER
WHAT IS 'RADIX 41' OVER/IT'S A WAY TO SEND 8 BIT DATA VALUES (2 BYTES,
/OH....../AS A 3 BYTE PRINTABLE VALUE, FOR COMMUNICATING
WITH COMPUTERS WHICH DON'T HAVE FULL 8 BIT CAPABILITIES,
SUCH AS A BZ...BASIC-ONLY SYSTEM.  OVER/QTHAT SOUNDS NEAT.  WHAT COURS
ES DO YOU RECOMMEND/ IN COLLEGE ABOUT COMPUTERS?  I AM ENROLLED AT IIT
 OVERU/DON'T KNOW.  COMPUTER SSCIENCE NOT INVENTED
WHEN I WENT 10 YEARS AGO...O V E R./HOW WAS THE LAST CASCHE MEETING. I
 WANT  AON A CANOE TRIP/OVER/NO MEAT.  JUST NON-TECHNICAL ON RADIO SHA
CK,/BUT THEN A TECHNICAL ONE ON THE 6800 INSTRUCTION SET
//WE..,,...WELL, I GOTTA GO.  WORKING ON HEATHKIT 2 METER
SYSTEM.  RANDY BUGGING ME TO GET GOING.  BYE..
