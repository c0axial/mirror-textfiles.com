      ALREADY HAVE IT. OPERATION IS SOMEWHAT SPORADIC - DENNIS HAS IT
      ON ONE OF HIS BUSINESS PHONES.  DAVE 


FEEDBACK FROM WARD CHRISTENSEN:

       ALL THAT STATIC ON MY FONE FINALLY TOOK IT'S COURSE, NOW
       MY PHONE IS COMPLETELY DEAD.  SAID THEY WOULD FIX BY MON PM.
       IT'S NICE TO HAVE MINIFLOPPY - QUICK STARTUP.  I CAN CALL
       CBBS, AND IF & ONLY IF IT ANSWERS, I CAN TURN ON THE SYSTEM
       AND ESTABLISH ....COMMUNICATIONS BEFORE IT TIMES OUT.  GONNA WRITE A 
       POST CARD TO THE GUY WHO SAID IT WAS NICE, BUT WE SHOUD
       HAVE A WAY TO SHUT OFF THE ECHO.  I'M NOT SO SURE THIS
       BACKSLASH ON THE RUBOUT IS SO NICE, AS IT MAKES THE INPUT
       LINES SO LONG IF YOU HAVE TO MAKE MANY CORRECTIONS.  MUST/DRIVE 
       TTY PEOPLE NUTS, IF THEY DON'T HAVE AUTO C/R.  BYE..
       GONNA LOOK AT MODEM FO  AT LEAST 1 HR TODAY.
