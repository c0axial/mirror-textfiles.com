OCCURRED.  ALSO WILL CHECK OUT \XXX\ SOFTWARE.

FROM: HOFFMAN
  TO: BILL SMITH
SUBJ: FORTH

      BILL, WHEN IS THE FIRST ISSUE OF YOUR IMPLEMENTATION
      THING/GOING TO BE OUT?  WOULD BE PLEASED TO BE YOUR LOCAL VOICE
      HERE--TO COLLECT NAMES, PASS INFO, 

[ Message aborted ]


FEEDBACK FROM BILL SMITH:

     WARD,

     HAVING BIG DIFFICULTY WITH MESSAGE ENTRY.  
     MY TERMINAL DOES NOT SUPPORT DELETE OR RUB-OUT.  THE ASCII
     STANDARD FOR BACKSPACE IS 'BS' (CODE 08).  DELETE RUBOUT WAS
     ORIGINALLY TRICKED UP AS AN EDITING TOOL FOR PAPER TAPE
     (IT WAS EXPLAINED TO BILL THAT WAY!! ).

     IF IT IS NOT AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT THING, COULD YOU IMPLEMENT
     SOME CONTROL CHARACTER AS A BACK SPACE?

     PERHAPS YOU WOULD PICK CONTROL-H !!

     (SOME SYSTEMS USE BACK/ARROW FOR BS, I DO NOT HAVE THAT EITHER)

FROM: DAVID SOUSSAN
DATE: 05/31/78
  TO: WARD & RANDY
SUBJ: THIS SYSTEM

      SORRY IF I HAVE SOUNDED LIKE I WAS 'TALKING DOWN' ANYBODY
      BUT HAVING WORKED ON A LOT OF LARGE SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS
      MINIS & MICROS, YOU SORT OF GET HOOKED ON WONE OF THE
      NEAT THINGS AVAILABLE (LIKE THE DEC-10 IN TUCSON). I LIKE
      THIS A LOT AND WISH THEY HAD MORE OF THESE (CAN'T WAIT
      FOR THE HARD DISK). THIS SYSTEM HAS SO MANY THINGS THAT
      REMIND ME OF THAT DEC-10 (CONTROLL R, S, U, DELETE) THAT
      I FORGET THIS IS AN 8080.

      SORRY IF I HAVE OFFENDED ANYBODY. LHANKS FOR LETTING ME KNOW
      ABOUT THE SEARCH. I THOUGHT YOU HAD TO GIVE IT THE WHOLE STRING
      INSTEAD OF JUST THE SUBSTRING. ARE THERE ANY MORE OF THESE
      AROUND?  LET ME KNOW. PLEASE.

      ER...BYE !
