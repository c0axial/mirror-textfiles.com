 I do not know for certain, but I can guess.
 EMM386.SYS is your LIM 4.n expanded memory driver.
 HIMEM.SYS is probably for Microsoft Windos.
 XMA2EMS.SYS probably offers some type of coordination between
extended memory (XMA) and expanded memory (EMS).
 You didn't get a DOS book, or a README file. Chances are, there's
a README that explains all this.

to DONALD MARTIN re: I WANT TO TALK TO THE SYSOP!

 Well, let's see.
 The <B>ulletin command (you also see the bulletin at login)
says something about Randy Suess (but he doesn't call here any-
more). It ALSO says something about Ward Christensen. It SPECIFICALLY
says something like "don't call me sysop". Hmmm.
 The CHAT command says that there's "nobody home" - on a PERMANENT
basis.
 Just HOW do you figure you're going to do this? The system just
TOLD you (in effect) that you CAN'T "talk to the sysop"!

Msg 43795 is 07 line(s) on 07/15/90 from PHIL SCHUMAN
to ALL re: SPINRITE II VER 1.1

Just received an unsolilicited upgrade - version 1.1.
Tried it out and it made me feel uncomfortable during it's operation.
It did a couple of strange things with the screen and during several of it's
operations it performed the slow stepping recalibrate - return to track 0.
I did not let it go thru the read/write/format of the tracks - I did not
trust it. went back to the previous version 1.0 - which I feel
more comfortable with.

to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/COPY "*" BUG

tnx - but this was right after a boot - to ensure nothing funny was going
on - - problem ONLY appears in DOS 3.3x - and UNLESS you look at the files
you think everything is ok.
