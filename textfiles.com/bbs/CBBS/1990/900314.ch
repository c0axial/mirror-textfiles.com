Msg 43345 is 16 line(s) on 03/13/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to BRENT JONES re: GRANDVIEW/PCO

 "I never sell anything".
 I tried PCO years ago, and found it pretty awful - no customizability of
keyboard, colors, and the worlds stupidest interface: typing / to bring up
command mode in an EDITOR.
 I have PCO.ZIP. I'm just too ornary (?? Can't find it is my spelling
dictionary) to like the user interface of either, and while I'm getting used
to GrandView on my T1000, I simply can't use it on my main system at work
because of the stupid low-level keyboard snatching that keeps me from
popping over to the host and back - something I do about 400 times a day.
 I need to spend more time with it - such as to learn how to make my
outline labels stick (I have kind of decided just on * for each item - I
DEFINITELY don't want it to number or letter things). I also need to find
how to get it to stop that horrid sideways scrolling. Gee, seeing a show on
Ch11 tonight about Thalidomide babies (now about 20 yrs old or more) I should
just be glad to have fingers to type with. Some of them have an ENORMOUSLY
better attitude toward life than I do! Gak.

Msg 43346 is 04 line(s) on 03/13/90 from JIM POLOUS
to ALL re: PROGRAMMING INFO

Does anyone have any programming info on the Atari Portfolio Computer?
I am specifically looking for interrupts to control the serial port as
no interpreter comes with it. CBBS
looks a little unusual on a 8 x 40 character screen on this tiny computer.

R/DBASE IV & MEMORY USAGE ??,
Dbase IV CANNOT use EMS or extended memory by itself (though it was
advertised as supporting EMS, A/T admits that it doesn't.  Apparently it
wasn't debugged by their marketing deadline).
If you can copy your files and indexes to ramdisk, work with them there,
and then copy them back to hard disk, you'll be able to speed things up
a good deal.  Using a disk cache would improve performance, but probably
not as much as using a ramdisk.
