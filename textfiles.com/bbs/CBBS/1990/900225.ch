to ALL re: 720K IN OLD AT?

 How do you add 720K to an old AT? A customer has been unable, trying
different drives, and using DRIVER.SYS with /d:1 /n:9 /t:80, etc.
(is it /s:9?) Anyway, it may format, may write, but if it does, it
does so in a way that other 720K machines can't read, etc.
 Any suggestions would be appreciated (forget DRIVPARM - that's undoc'd
and unsupported in PC-DOS)

Those interested in new software and hardware found in
MicroBytes(tm). This week's news includes a review on the new T1200XE
which is a 286 laptop. Also check out a VGA-386 laptop weighing eight
point five pounds! For those who travel a lot overseas, may need to
know about "lapAdapt" hardware. Car expenses? Try Autoplan! A cheap
hand-held scanner? What about checking into A4Scan? Want a UNIX
keyboard? NCD may have one you need! I believe it fits on any MS-DOS
clone!

These and many more new features of MicroBytes(tm) are found on a few
BBSs for free. One local BBS that does have the current Microbytes is
called "The Round Table" and the phone number is (312) 777-9480.

I hope you enjoy MicroBytes(tm) as much as I do. Thanks to Kevin
Keyser for his time and money to make this available to us locally.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/720K IN OLD AT?

My old xtclone uses one 360k drive and one 3.5i 720k dri.
This is done by having a line in pcdos 3.2 config.sys which reads:
 DEVI=DRIVER.SYS /D:1
The effect is that there are two physical drives and three logical
drives. e firs.noise is unacceptable now.

Concerning AS-EASY-AS, I just started trying it. Could you comment on
a suitable reference? I have a book on Lotus 2.2. But there may be
something more suitable. my version of AS-EASY-AS is the next to
latest version. probably 3.something.

to JEFF DEGLER re: BBS LIST

We have several BBS lists over on our board. You can search them for specific
criteria (such as "312" AND "545"), resulting in BBSes which meet both
criteria being displayed, all others excluded. However, that's a VERY
select set of criteria. You might try "312" AND "Chicago" (several of the
lists haven't been updated since the 708 area code change; the suggested
search will limit things fairly well). As far as I've ever seen, no
Chicago-area BBS list provides street addresses. So this is probably the
most effective way available. Good luck.
