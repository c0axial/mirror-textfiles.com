Msg 43093 is 02 line(s) on 01/26/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JIM BAILEY re: R/CRC 

I believe it is on the Ward Board CBBS (312) 849-1132, in the low
numbered messages.  I personally never did a CRC.
--End of 43093

Msg 43094 is 10 line(s) on 01/27/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to JIM BAILEY re: R/CRC 

The calculation is done by initializing the CRC to a particular value (I think
all zeroes, but I could be wrong.  Then for each character, you XOR it with
the high order byte of the CRC.  Next, you shift the CRC left 8 times.
Each time, if there's a carry, XOR the CRC with 1021 hex.  I believe
you then have to run two dummy characters through the CRC process.
To speed things up, you can pre-compute a 512-byte table which is indexed
by the high-order byte of the CRC after XORing with the incoming character.
You XOR the value from this table with the CRC, eliminating the 8-step
loop.  This speeds up the calculation about 5 times on an 8086-type
processor.

Msg #:?.
