to BILL PRECHT re: R/251-1 NOISE

 Both drives DO make that ratching sound. That sounds like a
normal thing. IF I knew that they did that AND have an antistatic
spring on the bottom, I would NOT have gotten them. I can hear
the noise when the humidity gets BAD from those grounding plates.

Msg 43326 is 08 line(s) on 03/07/90 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to JERRY OLSEN re: R/DEVELOPERS' CALCULATOR

 Sounds like a neat thing to try. I have found that most of MY problems
were from hardware incompatibility. I can spare some time on my
XT and 386 to Beta test the program. Don't know how far in depth
I would get with full functions but sounds better than spending spare
time programming.

to RICHARD GODZAL re: ST-251 NOISE

Unless the noise from your ST-251 drive is intolerable, don't
lament having bought them. They are designed to be quite reliable,
and have a mean time between failures (MTBF) of 100,000 hours.
Most other drives have MTBFs in the 20,000 to 70,000 hour range.
