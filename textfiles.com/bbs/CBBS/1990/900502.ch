to CHARLIE KESTNER re: R/SCSI INFO NEEDED

A SCSI drive has a built-in controller. A host adapter is the board
you put in the computer to talk to the drive; the hardware is a lot
simpler than an actual controller (the host adapter issues and receives
SCSI-protocol messages to and from the onboard controller; the controller
actually deals with the low-level details of drive access, formatting,
etc.).

Thanks. I was using another number.

Msg 43526 is 23 line(s) on 05/01/90 from BILL WOLFF
to JOSEPH SKOM re: R/ATARI PORTFOLIO

The Atari Portfolio looks scary to me. It sports 40 by 8 column screen and
comes with 128K of memory. No real disk drive and although it uses real
MS-DOS 2.11 commands, it appears to be true MS-DOS. As it won't really
run MS-DOS software without modification. And even so, what MS-DOS software
runs on 128K these days.

The biggest drawback that gets me is the 40 column screen! I don't know
if I could handle that again. I worked so hard to get away from 40 column
screens, you know!

Seems also to me, you are at the mercy of those who convert MS-DOS software
to run on the Atari Portfolio. Those titles maybe it, if sales don't go
very well.

The Atari Portfolio cost I heard about $400. Interesting, Sharp sold some
bare bones MS-DOS laptops for $325. They had one disk drive (3.5) and only
256K of RAM. You could beef it up to 1.6MEG and add two more drives. But
still being bare bones, it seems to be many times better than the Atari
Portfolio. Even the Epson PX-8 (CP/M laptop) has 80 columns and runs real
software.

But one thing is clear about the Atari Portfolio! It is really small and
does get some general tasks done at a small price. <BW>

 In other words, when a vendor is selling you an "SCSI hard disk
controller", he is actually selling you the host adapter?
.

Msg 43528 is 02 line(s) on 05/01/90 from STEVE RYAN
to ALL re: RS DATA TERMINAL

Anyone know how to set a radio shack data terminal I to 8/none/1/1200 baud?
Of course nobody at the stores I call knows anything beyond "it's old"

Msg 43529 is 09 line(s) on 05/02/90 from BILL WOLFF
to STEVE RYAN re: R/RS DATA TERMINAL

That's one problem Radio Shack has. I know of no old timers that stick
around. The turn over rate appears to be once a year or so.

That's really too bad. As some of Radio Shack stuff is pretty good.
Please note! I didn't say all of it was good, did I?

I hope for the best for you, in regards to your problem. I think those
who know the answer, maybe doing something else at this time. Hopefully
one or two are here! Again best regards!

Thanks for the info. Do you know the exact model # of the Sharp
laptop you spoke of and where I can get it?
