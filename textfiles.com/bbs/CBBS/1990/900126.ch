 Thanks for the phone number I'll check it out. I don't get much free
time during the day, and have been unable to get with Micro Help. I'm
not sure yet if it is something odd with their routines or something
I'm not d9eM~?~?~?~?correctly. Sorry about that line
noise I don't know what happend and I could delete it. Well I'll leave
a message on that other BBS and hope for the best. Thanks Again.
