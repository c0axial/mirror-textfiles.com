]ward,
Maybe you should put something in the Welcome stating:

"The XMODEM spec is located on my other system @ (708) ..."

Have a good one.

]For the small hard drive, you might try a company called PrairieTek.
I'm not sure if I'm saying something I shouldn't (never heard of the
company before I went under nondisclosure to someone), so don't say
you heard it here...

Call tht "Ward Board" at (708) 849-1132, and look at the "low numbered"
messages - I forget the exact number. The MODEM (aka XMODEM) protocol
is documented there.

thanks. I will do so Sun afternoon when my schedule is looser. Perhaps yours

Msg 43357 is 08 line(s) on 03/17/90 from JIM LIDDELL
to BILL PRECHT re: R/MAC FORMAT RECOVER

yes, Norton Advanced Utilities has one, and perhaps two, programs to
recover these files. I have used one of them (and there may only be
one as some of Norton is over my head and the manual is not the best
in the world for explaining things at the idotic level), and was
able to recover about 90 percent of a story I had written. What I lost,
for some reason, was the last revise I had done. Try NORTON Adv
Format Recovery (FR), called up with a /SAVE, but you need to use the
manual to have all the steps and text.

Msg 43358 is 03 line(s) on 03/17/90 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/386 BIOS

I might be interested-need first to check out whether it's the
BIOS or logic chips which is making my machine act flaky. I'm
not up on BIOS pricing; what price would you suggest?

Msg 43359 is 05 line(s) on 03/17/90 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/DISKETTE CACHE?

I think there's a diskette cache included in the PC-Kwik Power Pack
(forget the publisher)-you might check with them. Also, I think
there's one inuded in a package from Golden Bow Systems called
V<something or other> (they start the names of all their utils with
a "V"). Let me know what you find!

Msg 43360 is 10 line(s) on 03/17/90 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to ALL re: HD CTRLR FLAKY

A weird situation has come with my machine and its use of the HD
ctrlr-it will format, read, write, etc. the harddisk, but won't
boot from it! If I swap the disk subsystem out to another machine,
without reformatting or changing anything, it boots right up!
Thourough testing indicates that there is absolutely nothing
wrong with the disk or ctr (no bad boot sector, ctrlr problems,
etc.), and I've tried putting the ctrlr in different slots in the
problem machine, wit results. My theory is that either
a BIOS routine has gone bad (in ROM) or that a logic chip has flaked
out. Any ideas?? Have you ever seen this before?? Help!

Msg 43361 is 09 line(s) on 03/17/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to COLIN SCHROEDER re: R/HD CTRLR FLAKY

What happens if you boot from a floppy, take the floppy out and give the
3-finger salute? If you successfully boot from the HD under those
circumstances, what's happening is that either your HD is taking too long
to come up to speed or your controller isn't waiting long enough for the
HD to spin up. It could be that your power supply is flaky; if the power
to the disk motor is too low, the drive will take longer than usual to
spin up but will probably run OK once it reaches full speed (takes more
power to accelerate it from a stop than it does to overcome bearing
friction once it's running).

Msg 43362 is 08 line(s) on 03/18/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to COLIN SCHROEDER re: R/HD CTRLR FLAKY

As Eric noted, it does sound like a timing problem. If by chance you're in
the habit of skipping some of the start-up memory diagnostics (as I
sometimes was before adding a fourth drive recently), you may find-as I
did-that letting the diagnostics run further through its cycle (i.e.,
what it's doing when on most hardware it displays a number incrementing
on the screen) solves the problem. Otherwise, I would tend to think the most
appropriate place to start is a check of the power reaching the drive.
In any case, good luck in solving the problem.

Just to let you all know, computer wizards do exist. And Eric Buhlman
is one of them. This guy solved problems over the phone that a computer
company could not solve in two visits, plus phone conversations of their
own, over two years. If you have a problem, I suggest you leave a
message for him. This is, truly, an unsolicted endorsement. I just like
for the good guys to get recognized.
