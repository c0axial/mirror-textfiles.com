to ED FOSTER re: R/720K IN OLD AT?

 Thanks, but it seems an AT doesn't work as easily. I, too, added 720K
to my PC with no problems - this guy's AT seems to be the source of the
problems. Heck, it may turn out he has a bad drive!

Msg 43289 is 09 line(s) on 02/27/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: NO-PRINTER HANG?

Anyone have a little TSR that looks like you have a printer, when you don't?
 Occasionally when I drop back to DOS in CBBS, a line glitch comes along
and looks like ^P! As a result I have to call Randy and have him reset the
system.
 I'm sure I could hack one up - but if there's already one, I'd like to
know about it. It would merely have to say "OK" when an attempt is made
to print, i.e. act like it printed; and when asked if the printer was ready,
it would also reply "yes".
 Thanks!

Msg 43290 is 12 line(s) on 02/27/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to BILL MATSON re: CP/M UNLHARCER

Your mods almost worked. But even though at first glance it might seems
that toupper() would yield the info needed in lieu of the unavailable
strupr(), that ain't true. The full argv[1] (which is a char array <not>
one byte of a char array called argv[]!) must be copied and terminated
with a null. Otherwise, as happened when I tested your compilation,
random garbage would be copied into char arc_name[] till a random null
was encountered. Ungood. <grin>. I rewrote the one reference to strupr()
when CPM is defined to kludge the same effect, and put the revised code
up on The Advocate. Msg there has details to locate it.
 Can you give it one more shot? (Just a Z80 version OK till we
ensure all the bugs are out, then 8080 version appreciated too for
distribution purposes.) Thanx.

Msg 43291 is 03 line(s) on 02/27/90 from HARV MILLMAN
to ALL re: MATRIX INVERSION IN C

Need a public domain C source program to invert a matrix. Prefer the
Microsoft 5.1 C compiler. To be used by a grad student in a graphics-
related application. Any help appreciated. Thanks, Harv

Msg 43292 is 15 line(s) on 02/28/90 from GLENN POPELKA
to ALL re: ACCURATE AT TIMING (HOW?)

I need a pointer or two on how to program the MC146818A (the real time
clock chip the has the CMOS memory on AT class machines). I would like
to be able to load a count value into the clock and generate an interrupt
when the count gets to 0. Most of the examples I've seen (like from the
March 1986 Dr Dobbs), set it up so that the chip generates an INT 70h
on each clock tick,but I can't afford the overhead in this application.
I know this will screw up the real time clock; I don't care too much
about that. Does anyone have experience with this? Currently, I have
commandeered the other clock(8253), revved it up to 100Hz, and do my
processing in the int 08 routine, but again, I'm incurring overhead by
interrupting so often. Has anyone messed around with this or know of
some articles I should look at? I have the Moto docs for the chip and
the Phoenix System Bios book (that's a great book by the way.), but
still haven't made the big breakthrough.

Msg 43293 is 03 line(s) on 02/28/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to GLENN POPELKA re: R/ACCURATE AT TIMING (HOW?)

You can use int 1Ah, function 06h to set the RTC to generate an interrupt
(int 04H, which is normally for arithmetic overflow and normally unused),
at a specified time.

Msg 43294 is 11 line(s) on 02/28/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to WARD re: NO PRINTER

It would be easy enough to do; just write a handler for int 17h that
ALWAYS returns 0d0h in AH; that should be interpreted as "not busy,
acknowledged, selected."
The code itself would be:
noprint proc far
 mov ah,0d0h
 iret
noprint endp
The installation routine would be bigger than the actual TSR; all it would
have to do is revector int 17H to noprint and then TSR, keeping a para-
graph or two.

Msg 43295 is 03 line(s) on 02/28/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to WARD re: NO PRINTER

As it turns out, I did write and test a simple "no priner" TSR. If you're
interested in it, call me voice at 708-251-5787 in the evening and I can
transfer it (COM file is 32 bytes long).

Msg 43296 is 10 line(s) on 02/28/90 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to ALL re: WARNING

WARNING!
 If you are considering buying a machine from Spear Technology
(Northbrook), first consider the following:
 I ordered a Spear 386/25 in July, '89, and was promised (by ad
and by salesperson) a $100 rebate. After more wrangling, buck
passing, and runarounds than words can describe, I STILL haven't
received it! They won't even return my calls!
 The machine is fine, and I haven't had any problems with IT, but
if SPear's actions are any indication, their customer support
SUCKS! AVOID THEM!

Msg 43297 is 02 line(s) on 02/28/90 from ED FOSTER
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/720K IN OLD AT?

I thought you said you had tried several different drives. You sure
the cable is OK?

Msg 43298 is 11 line(s) on 03/01/90 from GLENN POPELKA
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/ACCURATE AT TIMING (HOW?)

Thanks for the response. The alarm on int 1A is only accurate to 1 second,
;and I need to send out voltage pulses on the order of 1-2 milliseconds.
That's what makes the problem such a pain. Also, this function kicks the
int 70h in on every tick, which adds overhead. I know the chip can be
programmed like I described, but I don't know whether it can be done in
the AT machine. It'd be nice to load a count value, set the timer to
1024 ticks/sec, and sit back and wait (well, not really) for the
interrupt. I want the chip to count by itself, without having to generate
an interrupt for every tick. If worse comes to worse, I'll get my boss
to buy a board with the AMD 9513 timer chip and use that, but we're
already stuffed with boards.

Msg 43300 is 07 line(s) on 03/01/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to GLENN POPELKA re: R/ACCURATE AT TIMING (HOW?)

The 146818 doesn't have a count-down mode with millisecond resolution.
It just maintains a time-of-day clock and can be made to issue periodic
interrupts. It's unlike an 8253 or 9513. I'd suggest using the 8253
channel that's normally dedicated to sound generation (that's the ONLY
thing it's used for, and the only thing DOS uses it for is the control-g
beep; OK, the BIOS also ses it for the keyboard buffer full beep,but ne
neither of those should get in your way.

Msg 43301 is 09 line(s) on 03/02/90 from GLENN POPELKA
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/ACCURATE AT TIMING (HOW?)

I'm about ready to give up on the 146818 for now. I'd use channel 2 of the
8254 ( or 8253, whatever.), but I don't think it's tied to an interrupt
line. My current method of interrupting at 100Hz on channel 0 is at
least letting me work on other parts of the project, but I'm starting to
take a look at other counting modes available on the chip (there's six,
I think). If I can't get an interrupt on countdown function, I'll have
to factor in the time it takes to process the interrupts into the count
value that is decremented on the interrupt routine. Arrgghhh.

Pat, For an up to date BBS list, call Stillwaters BBS, (708) 403-2826.
They publish an updated version each month, and a group of volunteers
(I am one of the many minions) calls each board to verify operations
before putting it on the list for that month. February's list had about
415 boards listed.

I have a couple of matrix inversion routines that are taken from Bevington's
Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences (a common
reference source among physicists). I translated matrix routines from FORTRAN
to C. I have used them and seem to be error free. I'll be happy to give you

Thanks for the information.  I understand that the eight bit counter

a much easier way to explain it.  Tomorrow morning should be fun, I
