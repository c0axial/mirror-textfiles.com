to MIKE WAROT re: WANT TO CODE?

 Gad, I got SOOooo mad at Grandview today - I started creating an
outline outlining the things I wanted fixed in Grandview, and by the
time I'd written about 100 lines, I realized I really HATED the product -
"annoying" things like indents not staying within the screen margins -
instead the screen jumps about 10 chars horizontally when you get near the
end of a line, etc. Also, it just does too much, has too many options,
and therefore is too big to be practical on my T1000.
 The basic principles of an outliner are that it maintains text in an
indented format, allowing any piece to be indented, undented, moved,
etc. So, for example if you have something that belongs under another
part of the outline, you can move it and all of its sub-entries.
 It would basically be an editor, but with more - the most common
characteristic is the ability to "collapse" entries, so you see only
some level of the outline.
 Wha' Cha' think?

The standard DeskJet sells for $500 and has a $75 rebate I believe.
So $425 buys a new DeskJet with a 3 year warranty. My guess is used
DeskJets should sell for $300, a DeskJet Plus fort( $400.

Can someone give information of 3.5 in. drives:
 How many tracks for a) 720k b) 1.44M ?
 How many sectors " " "
 Can a 1.44M drive read, write, and/or format a 720k disk?
 Any info on $19.95 conversion kits to change 720k to 1.44M?

to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/CLIPPER

Thanks for the response. My application is this:
 We want to make a single floppy 5.25" based, very simple database in
Clipper. It will be completely menu driven. I work for a Christian
mission agency with 1100 missionaries in about 30 different countries.
 We want to be able to hand a disk with the listing of jobs that are
available.
 On the front end of it we want to put a graphic type screen that
gives the name: The Evangelical Alliance Mission TEAM. Are you aware
of any way we can do a nice screen in say Corel Draw and then capture it
as a screen and display it just before going into the Clipper database?
 It would be nice to have letters that moved into place or something, but
I would settle for a simple .COM file run from a batch file just before
 my home phone (voice) is 708/665-4462
the compile Clipper application.

Jim, Thanks for the info on Clipper. Read my message # 43155 which
tells what I'm trying to do.

Ward, I explained what I am trying to do in message # 43155
 Do you use an application generator with Fox? Saw a guy develop a
very nice and complicated data base using Fox a little over a year ago.
 I was much impressed.

 So how long have you had GrandView, Ward? Want to sell it? I
just love PC Outline and have been "talking" to John Friend (author) on
CompuServe. He is getting me sold on GV. Maybe I should send you PCO.
 If you do wish to sell GV let me know. 708/665-4462

Tracks:
 720K = 80
 1.44 = 80
Sectors:
 720K = 9
 1.44 = 18
All 1.44 drives can read/write 720k diskettes but some are fussy about
the 2nd media cutout you find on 1.44 diskettes.
IBM PS/2's do not check the cutout and let you format a 720k at 1.44 but
if you transport the diskette to another make PC and it may not be
readable. The same also applies in the opposite direction if you format
a 1.44 media as 720k some drives will barf trying to read them.
Those 19.95 conversion kits are a punch that puts the second media
cutout in a 720k diskette to make it look like a 1.44.
There has been much discussion as to the prudence of doing such a thing.
Most diskette manufacturers understandably don't recommend the practice
some users swear that they never had a problem. Personally I wouldn't
punch a bunch of 720k's and then use them for long term backup purposes
but I tend to be conservative when it comes to backing up data.
Also be advised that if you plan to drop a 1.44 capable drive into an XT
class machine you will probably need to replace the diskette controller
to handle the higher density and I think DOS 3.3+ is the recommended
level to be at with 3.5" diskette drives.

You could write an intro screen in Borland's Turbo C and link it with
your Clipper application. Borland's BGI graphics libraries are fairly
nice and have scalable text in three or four font families. I wrote a
graphical network menu for my employer and our network in Turbo C.
You could also use Microsoft C or Assembler, but I haven't used either
enough to know the graphics conventions of MSC and I am not really into
80x86 Assembler (yet).

Today I was looking at the magazines at the B. Dalton Bookseller down-
town on Wabash Av. and I noticed an ad about the second or third
page for some shareware author's network. I remembered the data phone
number as 704-0313, but I didn't pay attention as to how to initially sign
on. If anyone is familiar with this system please let me know. It appears to
be 7,E,1 and half duplex. My work is almost a mile away from the bookstore
and I would prefer not to walk there again. Oh. the name of the magazine
was The C Users Journal.

I haven't seen the DAK ad, but I think what they're selling is what Zenith
auctioned off a few month's back. What DAK has is probably the early 386
machines.

to ALL re: 8-INCH DRIVE JUMPER SETTINGS

This question may disqualify me from the "advanced technical hobbyst"
category. It was perhaps an advanced topic seveyears ago. But
here goes any way. I'm running a Xerox 820-II with 8-inch Shugart
drives, 851's which are double sided. I also have units with the 801
single sided drives. The problem: I want to upgrade my single sided
drive unit to double sided drives. I recently purchased some Mitsubishi
double sided drives that are plug-in compatible with the Shugarts. The
number is M2894-63B. After much trial and error changing of the jumpers
on the electronic boards, the drives work in single sided mode, but I
can't seem to find the right combination of jumper settings for getting
them to work in double-sided mode. Does anyone have any information
about the jumper settings, any experience with the drives, or any
suggestions that may guide me in the right direction? I've got 3 drives
that are all behaving identically, so I don't think that the problem is
a drive hardware problem, and I have tried substituting them in a machine
that definitely can control double sided drives, so I don't think that my
problem is defective drives or lack of the right kind of disk controller
hardware. Any help will be appreciated.

Thanks for the info on 3.5 in. drives and disks. However, I am still
not clear on just exactly what the difference in the design of a
1.44M drive in contrast to a 720k drive as such (in contrast to the
capabilities of the controller.
