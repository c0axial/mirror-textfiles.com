to BILL COLEMAN re: R/FOXPRO VS PARADOX

  What functions are you looking for that For Plus doesn't give you now?
  I have upgraded to FoxPro both at home and at work - and haven't
installed EITHER - plus does more than enough.  The main thing that I
wanted from Pro was the ability to do screen formats that include more
than one database, but it turns out after a bit of experience, it isn't
that hard to "hack" it anyway.
  I passed up the Paradox offer - REALLY wanted to get it - because I'm
currently @#$%'ed at Borland for their schlock attitude toward me as a
customer - half a dozen different customer numbers, incessant junk mail
(I don't mind THEIR mail - but when they started selling my name, well
they went from 98 on a scale of 1-100, to 50, and they'll never again
pass 75 if they stopped selling my name NOW, which they haven't - in
spite of calls, letters, and many promises).
  Sorry for the tirade.

to BILL WOLFF re: R/VGA MONITOR ON CGA

  What kind of car do you buy for sporty performance, economy, speed?
  There is no such car.
  What kind of monitor do you buy for - did you REALLY say "Composite?",
CGA, EGA, and VGA?  I sure know of no such monitor.  Matter of fact, the
trend is to disallow the lower resolutions (say below 350 lines) because
of the extra expense of making components (like "flyback transformers")
that can function acceptably at widely differing speeds.
  Why would you WANT a CGA or Composite monitor, if VGA is your interest?

to PETE CANTELE re: R/THANKS (W/ C/ & J)

Though you're still generally better off using the declared-length approach,
you indeed CAN reuse a malloc()-ed pointer if a later array has a longer
length. You'd need to use realloc() to adjust the size of the memory block
previously allocated.

Msg 44022 is 05 line(s) on 10/08/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/WANTED INEXPENSIVE HD

Do you have an address for the HD repair service you mentioned? (Or, at
least do you have the full name? If so, is that Beaverton, OREGON, or ???)
If the info is handy, with the warranty it just might be a tempting approach
for a drive kicking around here which I might want to add to the BBS I run.
In any case, thanx.
No dup. chars.
