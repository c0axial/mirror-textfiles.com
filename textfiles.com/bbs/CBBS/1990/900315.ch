43348 03/15/90 JIM LIDDELL => ALL: "COMPAC RAM HELP NEEDED"

Msg 43348 is 19 line(s) on 03/15/90 from JIM LIDDELL
to ALL re: COMPAC RAM HELP NEEDED

I am having a bothersome, but not disabling problem, with the ram usage in
my COMPAC 386, 16MHz. (2M Ram, CEMM, with 40M hard). I have taken it to the
company from whom I bought it and even they can't seem to solve it. I seem
to not have enough RAM to handle my programs (list follows), and I always
have a "Computer out of Environment Space" reading during log-on. REcently
I have had difficulty installing from the "A" drive. I have watched my
NORTON cluster count and have Flu Shot +, V1.5 installed, and there doesn't
seem to be any virus or horse at work, though there is a lot about computers
which seem like witchcraft to me. I do not understand interleafing, pages,
and so forth. The programs I have are: WS5.5, Grammatik 4, Echo Talk, Logi
tech mouse and point, Norton, Paintbrush, Composer and Jukebox, Fontware,
Pocket Address Book, ChessMaster 2100, Redstorm Rising, MS-Dos 3.31, and
operate under MenuWorks. The menuworks is a self-loading/unloading TSR and
I was having this trouble before adding it, so it is not the problem. I am
willing to pay a SEASONED AND PATIENT PROFESSIONAL to come to my home at his
or her convenience to solve this thing. No "Hot-Shots" need apply. I live
in the River Forest area. Please leave your acceptance or "return" query on
this board for Jim Liddell. (I do not want to try to solve this by reading
board messages.) PS - the comm pkg is ProComm +. Thank you!
