to JEFF ARDIS re: R/MARSHALL PRESNELL

 You must have had a typo- you said "B package called Pipeline". Dunno what
that is - but never heard of Pipeline.
 I wrote MODEM.ASM, put it in the public domain in late summer '77,
a guy named Keith Petersen (.son?) did some mods such as defaulting my
"quiet" switch to "on", making it easier to be used on an unattended system
(before then, it was used only by 2 people each at their respective machines).
 He called this version "xmodem", which stuck as a name.
 What do I do for a living? I've been in technical support for IBM for
21 years. I got into micros because IBM didn't have machines at the
sales offices, to work with. I even tried to get IBM to create a PC in
the late 70's, but got a reply "thanks, but we don't see a marketplace".
 History of THIS board? Randy (Suess) and I invented CBBS - he did the
hardware, me the software, and it became the worlds first micro based BBS,
on the air in early Feb, '78. Written in CP/M 8080 assembler. Still running
that way, but on a PC with V20 chip doing emulation.

to JIM FLANAGAN re: WARD BOARD

Sorry, my father broke his leg, and in the process of getting away to
go visit I yanked out a phone cord from my voice line, and accidentally
loosened up the RS-232 connection to my modem (sigh).

Msg 43496 is 02 line(s) on 04/20/90 from TONY ANTONUCCI
to MARTY DIPPEL re: 80287

I will have to check on the manufacturer of the 80287, and yes I
would sell it separately. How 'bout $150

Msg 43497 is 02 line(s) on 04/20/90 from EDGAR COUDAL
to JAY PIAZZA re: DEC LASER PRINTR FOR SALE

if you haven't sold that printer by may 7, when i'll be
back in town, give me a call at 708 520-5773

Msg 43498 is 08 line(s) on 04/20/90 from MARTY DIPPEL
to TONY ANTONUCCI re: R/80287

Sounds good, if it's guaranteed to work, Tony. I've got a Hewlett Packard
Vectra ES/12, so the 12 MHz speed is a perfect match for me. Never heard
of a 12 MHz 80287 before, so that's why I'm curious as to manufacturer.
I think my computer takes the 40 (or is it 48) pin DIP package as opposed
to any pin grid array packaging that might be available - I'll tear it
apart this weekend and make sure. I'll get back to you on pin configuration
and you can get back to me on manufacturer and details on how you'd like to
do this. Thanks!

Msg 43499 is 05 line(s) on 04/21/90 from EARL HALL
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: 16550 FIFO ENABLE

 I just noticed a file on Plantz' BBS, called 16550A.ZIP, that's
supposed to enable/disable the FIFO buffer on the 16550 UART. I
remember a couple messages from you about the chip and having to
enable the buffer externally (can't remember the details). Maybe
this would do it.
