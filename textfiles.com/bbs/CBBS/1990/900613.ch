to CHARLIE KESTNER re: R/RETURN FROM COMDEX

 Well, in all honesty: I got a call from a guy @ Hayes asking if I'd
give a talk; I said yes. Later I got a call from him again - saying that
Dennis Hayes didn't generally come to these BBS operator/programmer meet-
ings, but when "he" heard that "I" was speaking, he decided to make an
appearance.
 He brought up some interesting things:
 1. he said that his original S-100 modem INCLUDED a sheet of application
suggestions such as putting up a system for club members to call in to;
 2. he recalled a call from me in Jan '78, but felt I was asking a question
I already knew the answer to; I commented on how I was 40 miles from the
system and the modem, and that made some thing more difficult; he said he
recalled that comment then, too (grin).
 3. he feels that the future of BBSs will be multi-media! in other words,
if they keep designing and selling faster and faster modems, it will some day
be practical to have true sound and pictures being done online to a BBS.
(the latest Hayes modem goes 38 KB effectively, due to MNP compression -
though not probably on ZIP files, etc).

 Feel free to leave a msg stating the name, #, hours, etc of your
board. But don't waste a bunch of time trying to draw an information-less
picture. It makes NO sense. It was deleted before much of anyone saw it.
 P.S. when you say "9600", are you aware there are MANY standards, and that
they're incompatible? V.32, HST, Telebit, Hayes, USR, etc. Be specific.

 Does anyone have a copy of GrandView or Agenda that they are not using and
would like to sell? Brent Jones 708-665-4462

Msg 43694 is 07 line(s) on 06/13/90 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to CHARLIE KESTNER re: R/MAIL

Nope, nothing came through. I have two working addresses -
try marchana@union.bitnet OR marchana@gar.union.edu, depending. It
was good to see you in the NEWS, though for some reason we can't post
from Union. I take it my message got to you, anyway, so try it again (use
the .EDU address) and we'l
we'll see what happens. I know I can get mail from the U of C with either
address.

Msg 43695 is 03 line(s) on 06/13/90 from CHARLIE KESTNER
to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/MAIL

 Will do.
 I was really curious why it'd bounced, since I'd faithfully
sent it back the way the it came. Aw, well. Such is life.
