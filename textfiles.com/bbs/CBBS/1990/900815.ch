43875 08/14/90 WARD CHRISTENSEN => ALL: "DATA EASE ON A LAN?"

Msg 43875 is 07 line(s) on 08/14/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: DATA EASE ON A LAN?

 Anyone else running DataEase on a LAN?
 One customer has it, and while it takes only 1.5 seconds to copy a 220K
file over the lan, (copy /b f:<some name> nul), it takes about 12-15 seconds
for a format to come up from the server! There doesn't seem to be all that
much disk activity on the server, and after doing it once, there is virtually
NONE - all comes from CACHE. We're somewhat stumped (but then I've never
seen Data Ease before, no idea what it does).
