Msg 44096 is 12 line(s) on 10/29/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to JIM POLOUS re: POWER SUPPLY

If you put too much of a demand on your power supply, it will just
"choke out"--not provide enough voltage.  It won't catch fire; it wouldn't
pass UL approval if there were any risk of that (the real risk would
be supplying AC to the computer through an extension cord that isn't
rated for the current drain).
The most common symptom of a supply choking out is a failure to boot
from the HD when the system is first turned on, but then a succesful
reboot using the reset button or three-finger salute.  The reason is
that spinning up an HD takes a lot more power than keeping it going
once it's gotten up to speed, so the HD will take too long to come
up to speed when it's first turned on if the voltage drops under the
extra current drain.

to ERIC BOHLMAN re: MOUNTING KIT

Do you need any screws?  I have the kit with no screws, but I have a small
bin of misc screws; aw, what the heck, I'll put 4 in the sides at least,
and I presume the screws you have for the sides of the drive will fit.
  This does NOT have the "paddle board" to convert from pins to edge
connector - this will be JUST the sheet metal that has mounting holes
for the drive and then to fit a 5.25" opening, and the plastic front
bezel.  Is that OK?
  I'll UPS it out or something tomorrow if I remember to bring it.
No need to pay postage.  Not worth the trouble.

Msg 44102 is 13 line(s) on 11/01/90 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to ALL re: NOLOCAL FOR DOS 2.X?

I have a program called NOLOCAL.COM, which causes your system to
bypass the local directory when you ask the shell to execute a
program or .BAT file, unless the name of the file is prefixed with
a path name.  It operates by intercepting INT 21 Function 4eh and
inspecting the filename and the location of the caller.  (If the
caller is near the top of memory, the assumption is that it's the
shell).
Problem is, NOLOCAL installs under DOS 2.0, but doesn't trap out
files.  Though NOLOCAL states it won't operate with DOS 2.x,
no reason is stated.  (The original would test for DOS 2.x and
would abort if true; but I patched that test out, and it still
doesn't run.)
Anyone have any ideas on why DOS 2.x won't work with NOLOCAL?
