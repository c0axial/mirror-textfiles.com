to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/FILE CONVERSION

I have a board that fits into my PC and lets me read and write Apple
5.25" diskettes.  The problem is that I cannot manipulate the directory
flags to make Appleworks think that a file I create is one of its
files.  There is a file "" that is in the directory and probably
accessible only with a sector editor.

Yeah, Jerry makes no bones about the fact that the world works that way.
And manufacturers sometimes make it clear that friendly reviews put
you on a favored list and 'straight' but negative reviews are not
considered friendly.  Others recognize that they can learn something
from a negative review IF it's honest and states accurate facts.

There's a Chicago Computer Guide published at 120 West Madison that's
a freebie.  I've seen boxes in the loop, occasionally at computer stores
outside the loop.  Computer People Monthly became Chicago Computing some
months ago, but I haven't seen it in recent months at all....though the
boxes are still around.

to ALL re: WARNING: SCANV70 IS A VIRUS

The following note appeared in the November 19, 1990, issue of UCS
MONITOR, a newsletter of Indiana University's University Computing
Services:
              "TROJAN HORSE ALERT:  SCANV70.ZIP

    "A new, particularly nasty 'Trojan horse' program contained in
the file SCANV70.ZIP is appearing on many public bulletin boards
across the country.  Do not confuse it with SCANV67C.ZIP, the
compressed form of SCAN, a legitimate virus protection program
commonly used at IU.  This Trojan horse affects only IBM and IBM
compatible PCs.
    "If you mistakenly add SCANV70.ZIP to your system, then 'unzip'
(uncompress) and execute any of the resulting files, you may lose
all data on your PC hard drive.
    "SCAN creators, MacAfee Associates, are working on a SCAN upgrade
that can detect and stop this Trojan horse.
    "If you discover SCANV70.ZIP on any PC or server at IU, or on any
public bulletin board, notify the ACCESS MicroCenter (PRISM::ACCESS,
IMU 059, 1-812-855-0910) immediately."

I'm the SYSOP of The Cicero Comm-Uter BBS in Cicero, IL.  I recently had
a bad run-in with an audio F/X card made by Forte'.  It seems to write to
the DMA channel that my hard drive uses, and it freaked out the drive.
I'm looking for the best price on a half-height hard drive and controller
for an XT-Class machine.  Used is o.k..

That's it!  Looks like this is a pretty well-organized BBS!  Look forward
to coming back soon

yup... we have someone downtown, but it's a hassle getting down or having them
come out west here.   However, if there was a person that knew and used
SPSS+ out here in the western burbs, that would help a lot....

thanks for your replies!  The TC code gave me some insights, and
I was able to write a serviceable, reasonably fast BASIC routine
which works (yes, work forces BASIC, but since I'm in charge now,
we can PORT to C!!).  So, I've PRTSCed all your msgs and will
save them for future ref.  I've heard of Inset, and will give them
a call.  Tnx again.
