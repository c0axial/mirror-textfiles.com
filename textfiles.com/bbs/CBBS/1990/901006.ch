  Why don't you try calling chinet (283.0559)?  There's quite a few
C-people on there (it being a unix box), and you'll probably get
more than a few responses (as they argue which is the best way to
do what).
  If you've used unix, chinet will hold no surprises (Bourne, csh,
Korn shells ALL available to newusers).
  If you've never used unix, just let the system hold your hand,
the signon is a breeze (a LONG breeze 8-] ).
  Just a thot...

Following up on Ward's msg, malloc() permits you to specify the EXACT
number of bytes desired. So if memory is a paramount consideration,
using that fxn in conjunction with your second struct could be
warranted.
     In real-world applications, however, the 30 sets of your "student"
data take up so little memory that the discussion is truly academic.
     Also, in actual applications if you were using more realistic,
much larger amount of data you would probably be writing a struct's
data to disk as soon as its entered--for reasons of data safety, memory
conservation and coding efficiency.
     In both of the latter circumstances, using your FIRST struct is
infinitely easier . . . and ironically is a better use of memory by
reducing the amount of code needed (which of course also occupies
memory).

to ALL re: THANKS (W/ C/ & J)

Ward, Charlie, & Jerry;
Thanks to you all for responding.
I'll have to clarify.  Once I define a structure that include
pointers to strings, I wanted to know how to enter strings into those
locations later in the program.
I tried a couple of things and this is what I see:
(This is my structure def:        struct student_st {
                                  char *lastname;
                                  char *firstname;
                                  int grade;
                                  }student, *studp;        )
If I declare the structure and DON'T initialize the strings
with data, all I get for string storage space is the two bytes
pointing to the string terminators ('\0').
If I DO provide initialization strings, the length of each string is the
length of the biggest string I can put into that member variable.
Ex:
        If I init student[0].lastname with "Cantele", that is the biggest
string I can put into student[0].lastname.
What I see I have to do is declare the structure with explicit lengths
for those two variables so that I will have enough string space to
input the largest string I'll need.
So I have to come to the conclusion that including pointers to strings
within structures are only useful when you also include initialization
values for those pointers.
If I had a more 'real world' situation I would do as Jerry said and use
the structure as a model and write the structure to disk once it was
entered.  If I'm still wrong please let me know. Once again, thanks.

DO YOU HAVE ANY INFO. ON THE EXISTENCE OF CROMEMCO USER GROUP(S)?
I ACQUIRED A SYSTEM WHICH IS EQUIPPED WITH THE CROMIX ( A VARIANT OF UNIX)
OPERATING SYSTEM. AS i UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM WILL ALSO RUN THE CROMEMCO
VARIANT OF CPM. THE SYSTEM BOARDS ARE MOUNTED ON S-100 BACKPLANE. THE
SYSTEM ALSO HAS A SCSI CARD. I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE HARD DRIVES USED WITH
THE SYSTEM, ESPECIALLY ANY INFO ON "PACIFIC DATANET". THIS COMPANY WAS ONE
SUPPLIER OF THE HARD DRIVES, AND I BELIEVE I HAVE SOME OF THE DRIVERS FOR
THE HARD DISK ON FLOPPIES. ANY INFO. WILL BE APPRECIATED. THANKS.

Ward,
    Would the DOS SUBSTitute command be of any use? You could leave the files
 as is and SUBST them to look like they were in the ROOT directories
of separate drives.

  One thing you might try - ask for a BUSTED disk - you can get a 20-30M
drive repaired for <$100 at Disk Drive Repair service in Beaverton, and
get a year's warranty on it, too.

The hardware is not feeling to well lately.  I guess that happens
to old CP/M systems.  I think it is either the CPU or a memory
board.

I think we need to run the software on a PC clone with an emulator.

Have you been keeping out of trouble lately?

Can a VGA monitor be used on a CGA system? I mean with only a CGA card and
all? If not, then does a VGA simulate a CGA card while really pump a VGA
output? Just wondering? <BW>
