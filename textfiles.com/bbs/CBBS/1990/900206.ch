Msg 43150 is 04 line(s) on 02/05/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: ZENITH 386 - GOOD?

  What's with Zenith that a bunch of products became "surplus" when Bull
bought them out, yet they're still in the PC business otherwise?  DAK
is advertising a big $9000 Zenith 386 for $3K.  Is this a good deal?
The boss' boss' boss wants to know (grin).

01 ?  Gad, I got SOOooo mad at Grandview today - I started creating an
02 ?outline outlining the things I wanted fixed in Grandview, and by the
03 ?time I'd written about 100 lines, I realized I really HATED the product -
04 ?"annoying" things like indents not staying within the screen margins - 
05 ?instead the screen jumps about 10 chars horizontally when you get near the
06 ?end of a line, etc.  Also, it just does too much, has too many options,
07 ?and therefore is too big to be practical on my T1000.
