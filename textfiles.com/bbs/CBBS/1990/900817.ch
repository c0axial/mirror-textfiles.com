Msg 43876 is 19 line(s) on 08/16/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to DOS USERS re: DRIVE/DISK SECURITY

I recall a couple of message exchanges some time ago expressing interest
in a way to secure hard drives from other users in one's home or office.
I've had a similar interest, so developed a software-only solution.
Disabling is as simple as specifying the desired drive(s). The next time
you want to enable them, all that's required is to boot from my program
disk. (It knows which drives you disabled.) The program also can be used
to disable important floppies.
 The results are sufficiently secure that DOS thinks that the disk
contains no directory listings yet, paradoxically, that the disk is full
(i.e., you can't read from OR write to it). Even Norton's Disk Doctor
couldn't "fix" a disabled disk.
 The program still needs development to build in security features
against user error (e.g., disabling the disk in the current default
drive), user-interface polish and additional testing. But I thought I'd
put out a feeler to see if interest in a releasable version exists. It
will be distributed commercially or as shareware. Whichever way we go,
we expect the registration fee to be modest.
 (Note: Periodic reports on the status of the program are maintained
on The Advocate BBS, 312.939.4411, 300/1200/2400, Chicago Loop area.)

Msg 43877 is 08 line(s) on 08/16/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to ALL re: IOCTL USAGE

I want to use the DOS "generic IOCTL for devices" fxn (44h, 0Dh) to
format and verify tracks. I understand that, prior to calling the
format and verify subfxns, I apparently must use the "set device"
(CL=40h) subfxn. To do so, I can get all the information I need to
pass by first using the "get device" (CL=60h) subfxn.EXCEPT the
data needed for the track layout table. Can anyone offer any help on
obtaining that info.or possible a work-around so the format/verify
subfxns can be called without first using the "set" subfxn? Thanx.
