to JIM SACKETT re: R/LINE NOISE

 No, I really don't know what to say! This is a quite new USR 9600 modem,
so it must just be that we have a somewhat noisy line, though I don't hear
many such comments (maybe people got tired of saying it ;-)
 Like I said, I use MNP, that completely solves the problem. Not a good
answer for everyone, though!

Msg 43574 is 08 line(s) on 05/12/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: T1000XE - GREAT!

 Bought my latest toy - a Toshiba T1000XE - it is a "low end" machine
(10mhz 8086) but sports a 20M hard disk, in a 6.4# package! I've loaded
Quattro Pro, and an almost 4000 record Foxbase database to it, it really
works quite nicely!
 I've got some specific projects in mind, - some writing for work - but
I also have some "data analysis" projects, and it should be big enough
for that! LapLink comes in ROM, and there is - NO FLOPPY. Since I'm quite
used to LapLink, this is not too much of a drawback.

to CLIFF SHARP re: R/COMM PROBS REVISITED

 This subject is too deep for me BUT. this sounds exactly like some
of the quirks of QBasic executing at the same time DOS is operating.
 Just read something to the effect of the compatibility of the
commands trying to access at the same time.

Msg 43578 is 13 line(s) on 05/13/90 from JOHN SERRANO
to WARD re: PS OUTPUT AT SEL

Do the laser printers at GRC support PostScript? I asked the guys in Rm
2054 in SEL, but they were of no help. Fred Berns warned me that the
system is quite buggy, but I ignored him (big mistake on my part). Any-
how, Irnt that the hard way; while printing multiple copies of an
Excel chart, I received the ASCII printer file instead of a bar chart.
I also would like to know whether or not these printers are HP Laserjet
II compatible, for I was thinking of printing to that kind of file.
I am one of the unfortunate many who fell in love with PS output but can't
afford it. If you have an answer, please leave me some e-mai at UIC.
My userid and node are: (U35828@UICVM). A prompt reply is really appre-
ciated!
 Anyhow, I have to go. Hope to hear from you soon!
