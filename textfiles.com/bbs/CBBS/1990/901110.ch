to ALL re: CRASH IN WINDOWS 3.0

I run Microsoft Windows 3.0 from a 286-based PC with 1mb ram.  I was
running two separate files under Excel.  The files were on their own
Excel program (rather than running both files under one), with one being
printed on a dot matrix (through Print Manager) while I was working on
the other one.  I had saved the one file and proceeded to go to the one
that was still printing.  When I switched over, my system went haywire.
It happened when I was trying to save the file that was being printed.
When I saved, my mouse pointer started to move back and forth (on the
screen) very quickly.  After that, the screen went blank and the system
rebooted itself.  When I tried to go back to the file that I printed,
everything was erased.  Fortunately, I had a backup on floppy and pro-
ceeded to use that instead.

Was my crash caused by a bug in 3.0, or was it because of my hardware?

The easy part first....I've had no reported problems simply testing
the active video buffer for nulls and assuming graphics mode if any
is found. The fxn (in 'C') looks something like this:
isgrahics() {
register int i;
int vidseg;
char far *vidchar;
if (*(char far *)0x00400049==7) vidseg=0xb000;                 /* mono */
        else vidseg=0xb800;                                     /* color */
vidchar=MK_FP(vidseg,0);           /* ptr to beginning of buffer */
for (i=0;i<1999;++i)
        if (*(vidchar+=2)==NULL)  /* hop over video attrib bytes */
                return(GRAPHICS_MODE);
return(CHAR_MODE);
}
I've avoided mucking with different adapter types like the plague.
:-) But I'll include a partial solution for you which works as far
as it goes:
graphic_type() {
register int i;
register unsigned j;
int our_bit;
geninterrupt(0x11);                                /* get BIOS equip */
if ((_AX&0x0030)!=0x003) return(CGA_AVAILABLE);
else {
        our_bit=inportb(0x3ba)&0x0080;
                               /* look for bit to change 10 times */
        for (i=0;i<10;++i) {
                for (j=0;j<=32000;++j)   /* give it a fair chance */
<cont.>

Msg 44133 is 07 line(s) on 11/10/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to COLIN SCHROEDER re: <CONT.>

                        if inportb(0x3ba)&0x0080)!=our_bit break;
                if (j>32000) return(NO_GRAPHICS_ADAPTER);
                }
        return(MONO_HERC_COMPATIBLE);
        }
}
Hope this helps a trifle....

Msg 44134 is 14 line(s) on 11/10/90 from JAMES SCHMIDT
to ALL re: 8086 DISPLAY 32BIT #

I'm taking a class in 8086 assembler and need a little direction please.
I have a 32 bit number:

Bignum     dd    1234567890

I need to display it in decimal digits. I'm at a loss on how to do it.
I'm not looking for code just some suggestions or pseudo code.
I figured I could assemble the digits from right to left by dividing
by 10 and displaying the remainder then divide the previous quotient
by ten and display the remainder etc. etc. but 32 bit division is
beyond where we are in class at this point.

Like I said, any help would be appreciated.
James

to JAMES SCHMIDT re: R/8086 DISPLAY 32BIT #

   You're on the right track.  I don't know of any way to display a
32-bit number as ASCII decimal without the divide-by-ten.  Now, a clue;
if you think of the 32-bit number as two parts, A and B, think of it as
2^16*A+B.  You're  trying to do (2^16*a + b) / 10, and get the remainder
each time.
   Think of the way you do long division on paper; the remainder from
each single division is carried down and prepended to the next digit(s).
If you can envision doing it four digits at a time, this will make sense.
   Divide the high-order 16 bits of the number by 10; save AX as the new
high-order part.  Ignore the remainder in DX for a minute.  Now just put
the low-order 16 bits in AX and divide again.  Save AX as the new low-
order part, and DX is the remainder, which you'll add 30H to and print
as the last digit of the decimal number.
   By leaving the remainder in DX, you "prepend" it to the low-order bits
in much the same fashion as you would doing a long division on paper.
   Oh, don't forget to zero DX before doing the first (high-order part)
division...
No dup. chars.
