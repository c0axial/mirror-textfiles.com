 Sorry, Curtis can't "forward" msgs to you. It doesn't work that way.
This system has no private msgs, so any replies he gets you'll be able
to read, also. To check for any msgs TO Curtis Carter, type the command:
 or;1,t=carter
-or-
 or;1,t=curtis
 Good luck - and welcome to CBBS, the "worlds first" BBS. My apologies
for its crudeness - but then occasionally I had run driving around in
a model T a few times, too! ;-)

to JERRY OLSEN re: R/4 SALE

I'd be interested in details concerning this S-100 system. Working
or not? What boards does it have? Is it IEEE? Packaging.bus, box,
power supply, KB, ports, method of video display, etc. etc.also
8-inch or 5-1/4 drives, companion boot disks or other specific
software, (hardware specific, that is). Regards.

to ALL re: PARADOX/LOTUS HELP

I have a requirement to track sales data for over 100 elements.
This is being re-keyed from our monthly reports - so it's all new.
I was thinking of a record like this.
 location / year / month / sales
I need a couple of different things from this data.
 1. monthly breakout comparing this month with same time last year.
 location sales
 abc - current $150
 abc - previous $100
 % of change 50%
 xyz - current $200
 xyz - previous $100
 % of change 100%
and so on for over 100 tracking elements.

I would also like to produce some trending reports & bar graphs
 location 87 88 89 90
 abc $100 $124 $156 $178
 xyz $134 $174 $126 $198
I have started keying the data into Paradox - seemed like a reasonable
way to go - ease in printing - but ran into roadblock - can't figure a
technique for generating the percentage line item. ????
Also thought of using Lotus 1-2-3 or Quattro - but seems tough to have
all the data as rows and then pick thru it for the proper months/years,
even though the graphing would be better. Maybe a combo ????
This seems like a traditional sales tracking situation with comparison
reporting and trending graphs.
Anyone doing something similar ??? If so, there could be $ avail for
your help instead of me bouncing my head off the wall.

Msg 43658 is 15 line(s) on 05/31/90 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to GARRETT DERNER re: R/HAVE CLIPPER/ WILL DEVELOP

 The program I had trouble with was written in Clipper. how
much Clipper I don't know but she mentioned she had switched to
Clipper some time ago.
 I not only run DOS 4.01 but have "share" loaded for the large
drive that is partitioned with DOS4. The error I received
was from the "share". Apparently Clipper might have a but with
THAT command. She got around it the sloppy way, just making
a setup file with the drive used rather than debugging and finding
out WHY the file went to the FIRST (C) hard drive rather than the
one it was on (D). At the error I just hit A for about and the
program went along BUT. the setup was not saved in the
sub-dir I had the program. it went to the "C" drive where it
could not be read agin by the program.
 Oh well, maybe a new bug for Clipper maybe sloppy programming,
maybe incompatibility with DOS4 period!

Msg 43659 is 06 line(s) on 06/01/90 from GARRETT DERNER
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/HAVE CLIPPER/ WILL DEVELOP

The Clipper/C program I was testing failed on a client's maching, which
was using DOS 4.00. The partition was 80MB-does that mean they HAD to
be using SHARE? I'm intersted because I'm considering other ways of
partitioning my own hard drive besides what I'm currently doing. I'm
currently using Disk Manager's LDRIVE.SYS on a large SCSI. Trouble is
the block size is THIRTY TWO KAY!
