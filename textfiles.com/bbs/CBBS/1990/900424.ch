]Gee, Tony - sure sad for all your problems!  Hope things are coming along
OK and that at least it isn't too painful or slow to TYPE!   I was asking
myself "what would I be doing if I were in my father's position" and of
course the answer: "computing" came back.

That's MNP.  You're getting "packets" not "bytes".

Msg 43503 is 25 line(s) on 04/24/90 from MIKE SANDMAN
to ALL re: JOB OPPORTUNITY

American Data Voice Systems, Inc. is looking for an experienced programmer/
technician to work on our mix of voice and data products.

We handle Automated Attendant, Voice Mail, Interactive Voice Response
systems (that can get information from another computer, like checking your
bank balance), Voice/Data terminals, data over voice modems, protocol
converters, telephone call accounting systems,
and a Novell network product called Centaur (a mainframe like
PC based network that uses dumb terminals on the user`s desk).

We often integrate a number of the above components to give our customers a
total system solution. Our customers are primarily large to very large
businesses in the Chicago area.

We are looking for someone with programming skills in C (Pascal would be
nice also), and experience as a Novell administrator. Some knowledge of
electronics and troubleshooting is also required. This is a position for
someone that has been in the business for a while, and would like to grow
with the company they're working for. The salary would be in the low to mid
thirties. Heavy customer contact is required, and some public
relations and people handling skills are needed.

If interested, please call Mike Sandman at ADVS, 312-951-5553, ext. 2551

Thanks...Mike

Does anybody else have this problem?  Sometimes when I call this board
I get the answering carrier and my modem (an internal 2400-baud Prometheus)
does not detect it, keeping the originating carrier on until Mirror times
out.  But if I tell it to redial immediately, it answers and connects
OK.  This happens about 50% of the time on this board, but not with other
boards or services.

A similar query on another board smoked out a copy of a manual for the
Mitsubishi drive.  It turned out that what I needed to do was to change
some jumpers in a dip shorting block as well as make some of the changes
in jumpers that you suggested.  All the drives work fine now.  I substituted
a set of dip switches into the socket for the shorting block, set the
settings as required for the Xerox, and all worked fine.  With respect to
the upgrade that you mentioned, I believe that it was an upgrade TO an
820-II from an 820.  The old 820's could use only the SSSD drives, while
the -II's could use SSSD, SSDD, DSSD, or DSDD drives.  Thanks for your
suggestions, by the way.

Tony --  Been wondering where you've been!  Is the coprocessor still for
sale?  I'm interested.  My computer takes a good ol' fashioned 40 pin DIP
80287.  Processor speed is 12 MHz, so it's an ideal match.  What's the
most convenient way for you to make the transaction?  I live in the city
near Addison & Kimball, and work out in Elk Grove.  And You?  Would it be
convenient to meet before or after work?  If either of these locations (or
anything in between) is inconvenient, I'd not be averse to meeting you
later in the evening.
