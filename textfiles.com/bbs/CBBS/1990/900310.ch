]Wish we had something here to make a loudnoise in the Suess apt.
Chinet is evidently on some kind of "hold."  All modems accept
dial up and "connect." But that's all.  Owell, mebbe he's busy
making "adjustments."  Wish he'd busy 'em out instead. LD callers
pay for the connect.

Msg 43330 is 09 line(s) on 03/07/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: RELIABLE SMALL DRIVE?

 I'm converting the Ward Board into an experimental SMALL system - starting
with a - get this - 95 PC motherboard with V20 (V30?), and I'm going to TRY
to fit the ENTIRE system into a full height external hard drive cabinet.
 The only boards I'm going to need are: combo, HD, video, network (it is
a 4-slot motherboard with floppy built-in). I'd like something reliable,
but small. Someone suggested Connor, but heck in the latest Computer
Shopper, Connor had about the worst MTBF.
 Any ideas?
 Thanks.

Joe,
 I am looking for a laptop, and I saw that you have a T1000 for sale.
The price of that unit looks attractive, but could you please tell e what
processor/disk drive(s)/RAM that unit has?
Thanks.

to ALAN SAHAKIAN re: R/ST-251 NOISE

 Just glanced at the specs in Computer Shopper. The 251 will outlast
(I hope) my 4096 by 2 1/2 times.

to ALL re: NEED FOR MODEM PROGRAM

I have little modem experience. I need a modem program for a DEC Rainbow in n
it's CP/M mode. I am able to transfer programs into the DEC format, but I
cannot get them out. I have written something I need to send to myself at
work via the modem. I would like to know the phone number of a BBS that
would have such a PD program.
