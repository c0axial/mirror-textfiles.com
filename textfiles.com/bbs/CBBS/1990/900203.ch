 No, not at all. (I don't know more than you do). I guess I was just
surprised that a name as similar was in use - but you didn't mention
BYTE specifically. Now I understand it all. I presume that a small
portion of the downloadable MicroBytes is actually printed in the mag.
 Gee, wish Byte had been able to continue to afford their nationwide
network! I used to enjoy being on Bix, but dropped out when they went
to the $2/hr surcharge via TymNet "or something like that".

 Who is it that you are trying to contact, whose voice mail is always
full? Please leave the reply as a COMMENT when you (G)o so it will be
private (this BBS doesn't have private msgs).
 Catalog of educational software? Gee, someone asked me for that, and
I went to one of the people on the schools staff, and they came up with
one (though they admitted it was the last one they had). Owell, hopefully
they had more on order. I'll send a phone mail to the "team" and see what
we can get.

Hi Ward and all, I run The Round Table BBS which features MicroBytes
along with some other interesting articles. You are correct, MicroBytes
IS Copyrighted by Byte. I pay a fee of $49.00 a quarter to carry it.
I capture the files once a week from BIX and then place them in my
text section.

Msg 43129 is 21 line(s) on 02/03/90 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to ROBERT GOLENIA re: R/1M SIMM BUYING GROUP

Here's the scoop on the fax/modems: They're from a company called
PCA (short for PC Alibi!) which I've never heard of. They sell
a 9600 bps FAX/2400 bps modem.half card internal, with software
called FAXOFT, which I've also never heard of. There are two
choices; a send only FAX for $119 (qty 2, and I'd be glad to order
one also), or a send/receive FAX for $199. They also have other
modem configurations.
 They claim that their menu-driven software can schedule timed
FAXing to single or multiple numbers, and keeps a log of numbers called
plus keeps phone directory and generates error reports. The card
is claimed to support auto-redial, and support ASCII, PCX, and
TIFF files.
 I'd be interested in either configuration, perhaps with a slight
preference for the model that can also receive faxes, though I don't
see an IMMEDIATE need for that. If you want, I can FAX you some
of their literature from my office-just leave a FAX #.
 Finally, a caveat; as I said, I'm not familiar with the company.
I got their card in some direct mail advertising. The upside is the
price, of course, and they offer a 5-year warranty. At that price,
I think I'm willing to take a chance, and I need a new modem anyway!
