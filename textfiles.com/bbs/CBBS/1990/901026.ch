 FTTERM came out, I think, before there were supported COM4: ports.
 Is this on a PS/2? That's the only system that a COM4: is supported
at all, and it could be FTTERM simply doesn't know about it. Sorry,
I just have no idea. One "hack" you could try is to set it for Com2:,
but patch the bios table for COM4's address. Since 2 & 4 use the same
interrupt, as long as your mouse is on 1 or 3 so it uses the other
interrupt, the software MAY look in the BIOS table.
 Alternatively, if your bios table doesn't HAVE all the com ports in it,
i.e. you go into debug and: D 40:0, and you don't see 4 addresses (16-bit
values for each) then you might try patching in the base port addresses
of the 4th port.

 I bought a Toshiba 3.5" drive for a machine I was putting together to
run the Ward Board on, but then the motherboard of CBBS here at Randy's
died, so I donated the machine to him. The drive came with a 5.25" kit,
you're welcome to it. Shipping will be the hassle. You wouldn't happen
to be a south-sider, would you? (or work downtown?)

Is this file transfer S/36 to S/36 or S/36 to PC? If it's S/36
to S/36, give IBM's ODF/36 package a try. very clean. a bit complex
to setup but once it's setup properly it works great.

Msg 44079 is 16 line(s) on 10/25/90 from DAVID GIBBS
to ALL re: C PROBLEM

I've got a project that I need to program in C. my compiler is MS's
QuickC 2.5.

The problem is this. I need to pick up information from data that is
stored at the address pointed to in locations 0000:0036 & 0000:0037.

I assume that I need to setup a "far pointer" based on the contents of
the above addresses, but so far I haven't been able to figure out how.

I've tried forcing the Segment & offset using the FP_SEG & FP_OFF
functions, but that always get's me an "Illegal far pointer usage"
message.

Any assistance would be appreciated.

to ALL: WYSE UPGRADE re: DO UPGRADE KITS REALLY EXIST?

Hello All,
 My question surrounds how to upgrade my current Wyse 80286 system.

 When I purchased the system one of the advantages was stated as its
ability to easily upgrade the unit because the CPU and supporting logic
chips were on a removable board.
 I have not seen anything advertised as to the availability of upgrade
boards and was wondering if anyone has and how much it costs to upgrade
to a 80386?

 I appreciate the info.

 Roderick.

to DAVID GIBBS re: C PROBLEM

Your problem might be very simple. I used to program in Microsoft C, but
I found that Borland's Turbo C is a little more robust. In any event,
I believe that there is a
 peek function in both dialects of C. In Turbo C:

x = peekb(0x0,0x36);
y = peekb(0x0,0x37);

to RODERICK PRINCE re: R/DO UPGRADE KITS REALLY EXIST

I have a Wyse Model 3216 386 based WYSE and yes it has the replacable
CPU card. I've come in contact with a WYSE Model 2112 (which is probably
what you have.) I don't recall if it is stricktly a passive backplane or
if it has some control circuitry on the main board. The 386 I have here
has no electronics on the main board except to provide power from the
supply. If that is the case with yours, you might want to contact a WYSE
dealer for the CPU card and RAM daughterboard. One note: the 3216 does
not use normal dynamic RAM chips. It uses 256K x 1 Static column dynamic RAM
which is not common (from my experience). However, if you check your
latest PC-MAGAZINE or Computer Shopper, a company called UNITEX sells these
hard to find chips. If you need a WYSE dealer, you can call Guy Gross at
MIS Computer Corporation at 312-772-1200. He may be able to order it
for you.
