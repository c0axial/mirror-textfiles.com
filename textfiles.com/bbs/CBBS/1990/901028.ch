to DONALD DOCKMAN re: TURBO C BOOKS

  You left a comment for me asking "does anyone know...".  Let me explain
how bulletin boards work - a MESSAGE is there to be seen by anyone who calls
in - use the "E" command.  A comment when you go, such as you left, is to
comment on the system - like that something didn't work right, etc.
  Please <K> this msg, then <E>nter a msg asking what you want to know about.
  Thanks!

  Thanks for the offer - but the bracket is small and light enough to
easily go in a small box...  11 hundred south would cost me MUCH more
for a cab ride to you, than just mailing it from here - but thanks for
the offer!  Very kind of you!

to JIM POLOUS re: R/POWER SUPPLY

Jim, you did't mention what type of hard drive you have.  I am
assumming you are concerned with power draw from the power supply
to see if you are overloading it?  Hard drives pull lots of power.
you should call your suppliers and ask what wattage each item draws.
them add it up , if it exceeds 150 watts, ouch!
another approach would be to CURRENT PROBE all power supply wires.

Msg 44092 is 30 line(s) on 10/28/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to MIKE REINHART re: R/HAMFEST UPDATE

  Am I going to the HamFest?  No, sorry.  Do appreciate your list though!
You some kind of HamFest junkie? (grin).
  Did you know CBBS is designed to be able to have such a list update and
put in a new msg?  If you DO want to continue as king of Hamfests here on
CBBS, would you honor us with updating the list?
  Let me give you some commands to use.
  First, to find your msg about hamfests, do this:  or;1,s=ham&f=rein
That's a search command: (O)ne line summary with (R)etrieve, from msg (1),
(s)ubject = ham, and (F)rom = Reinhart.
  Once you see what your msg # is, remember it.  (it is 43981 right now).
  Second, use the (E) command to enter a new msg, give it a subject of
HAMFEST UPDATE just like the last time.
  Third, instead of typing anything, press enter to get out of input, and
do a (g) command - gets a previous msg.  In this case, g;43981.
  This will read your old msg into the edit buffer.  Then use the various
edit commands - (D)elete line, etc.  Be aware that lines are renumbered,
so for example I think right now, line 3 is "OCTOBER 7", and 6 lines are
now passed - (though you might want to leave some because people would
be "informed" by realizing what they MISSED to - dunno, I respect your
thoughts on that).  SO lets say you wanted to delete 6 lines: The most
expert thing to do would be: d;3;d;3;d;3;d;3;d;3;d;3 - i.e. since each
delete renumbers (slides the remaining lines down) you should delete the
same line over and over (or d;8;d;7;d;6;d;5;d;4;d;3, heh heh).
  The "C" command would then continue input - or to see where you left
off, use: the command: l;1;c - list from 1, then continue input.
(unfortunately, the lines are listed with line #'s, but then the "C"
command results in a ? prompt, so things shift over one.  (Each line of
your file is indented 10 spaces - you can tab to get to 8, then space-space).
  Then just save the msg as usual, THEN KILL THE OLD MSG (or let it be,
CBBS - actually ME, will eventually purge it when it gets 270 msgs old). Tnx!

Msg 44093 is 08 line(s) on 10/28/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to MIKE REINHART re: R/HAMFEST LIST UPDATE

  BTW, if you want to make changes to the list that consist of editing
existing lines, you might find it worth your while to get into the
"full line editor" - the "E" subcommand of msg entry then allows cursoring
around the line, insert spaces, delete chars, overtype, etc.  Do HELP FULL
(gad, I HOPE it is there!)  If not, just type FULL to go into full line
edit (unfortunately, it has to be done outside of msg entry - though I
vaguely recall putting an undocumented "F" command inside msg entry, Hmmm).
  Tnx.

to MIKE REINHART re: GOING TO HAMFEST

  I forgot to say - no, sorry, not going to the hamfest.  Saturday we had
our monthly club meeting, and I spent the rest of the afternoon washing and
waxing the car getting ready for the winter - still have to rub out the
sides, I got tired of doing it after about 3 hours.  Today (sunday) I'll
be setting all the clocks (grin).  Actually, I've got to mulch a bunch
of leaves as well as rub out the car wax.
