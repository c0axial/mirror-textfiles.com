to DENNIS TOKOPH re: EIES LOGON

Hi Dennis,
 I've logged onto the EIES some time ago (under David Johnson), but
recently haven't been able to get in. The system continually tells me
that my password is incorrect as I enter it. Could you have my password,
(it should be 8 chars) changed to all CAPITALS (that is, if my registration
is still valid), so that I may attempt to log on again? I'd appreciate it.
 I'll log back on here in one week (Sun. 3/25) to see if you left a
message. Please do so in any event, so that I may get back into the syste
 Thanks.

 David Johnson.

Msg 43365 is 09 line(s) on 03/19/90 from DAVID JOHNSON
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: DIFFERENT MODEM?

Hi Ward,
 Have you replaced the modem on the board? Previously (many months ago)
I was able to log in at 1200 baud (I believe). However, on the past
several attempts to log in at 1200, my modem issues a carrier, but doesn't
receive one from the board. I don't know if it's a problem on my end (have
been able to log on elsewhere at 1200), but thought I'd let you know about
it.

Dave.

does anybody know of a good c compiler for the apple?

Msg 43367 is 03 line(s) on 03/19/90 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to COLIN SCHROEDER re: R/386 BIOS

 The only way I can figure out the price is call someplace and
see what they are charging list and take a lot off that. I haven't
see any advertised prices for 386 BIOS.
