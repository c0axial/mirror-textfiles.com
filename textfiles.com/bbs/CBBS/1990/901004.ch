to BILL WOLFF re: R/WHAT FEATURES IN FULL COMMAN

  Hmmm, I must have written up FULL in the NEWS, which seems deleted!
  I don't think there are any secrets in it - but you have to type
FULLW or FULL? to really see what's going on.  Interesting kludge - in that
if you just type "full", you don't really know what's going on!  I should
have the same msg come up for "full" as comes up for "fullw".  The only
undocumented thing is that there's a "fullc", which is for "Christensen",
since I never went for the Wordstar keys - matter of fact, neither did
Wordstar!  The first Wordstar version patterned itself after WordMaster,
which used ^H-J-K-L for left, down, up, right.  I find that a lot easier,
since I'm right handed.
  FULL is a full LINE editor, with word fwd & back, beginning & end of line,
char insert (not "insert mode" unfortunately), delete char, delete to end
of line, and char search.  Makes typing a LOT easier, particularly if you're
used to WordStar.
  Here's what happened - a "log" of my "session" dinking with fullw:
>Function:?fullw
Use FULL? to check assignments
>Function:?full?
Assignments are now:
^B=Front/back, ^A=Word left, ^S=Char left, ^D=Char right, ^F=Word right
^V=Insert sp., ^G=Del left, ^P=Erase line, ^I=Tab right, ^_=CharSearch
  -----
  Note, one drawback is that if you hit ANY wrong key, it aborts the line.
Only "C/R" (<enter>) will save the line, as modified.
  Also if you have full on when going into msg entry, then the line editor
(e;g e;20 to edit line 20) will put you in full-line mode.
  Oh, the ONE undoc'd feature is ^W: repeat.  Each ^W multiplies by 4.
Entering a # multiplies by that #: ^W12# produces: ############
(However, if such "noise" is routinely put in msgs, I del those msgs ;-)

Since I like WordStar commands and I am right handed too, I assume I should
use FULLW command. If so... what is FULL  itself good for? <BW>

Msg 44000 is 26 line(s) on 10/03/90 from PETE CANTELE
to ALL re: C HELP NEEDED

I'm looking for some assistance.  I'm studying C and I've come across
something that I can't figure out.
(I'm doing a sample problem in my Learn C book.)
I've declared a structure (that works) thus:
;
        struct student_st{
                        char lastname[20];
                        char firstname[20];
                        int grade;
                        }student[30];
;
I fill the members (student[x].lastname & .firstname) using gets(...);.
if I change the structure, (as my book suggests is possible), to this:
;
        struct student_st{
                        char *lastname;
                        char *firstname;
                        int grade;
                        }student[30];
;
it should allow more efficient use of string space since member data
that is less than 20 chars. uses only what's needed.
Hmmm... Now that I reread this I'm wondering.  Can I only do this with
strings that are predefined?  (That is, strings defined at initialization
time?)
Only one of my three C books talks about members being pointers.

]>>ME, help chinet? Gee, she's sweet.  All I did was mooch dinner, and
about 35# of DC300XL tapes off Randy!  Surprised he got it up already!
He's moving it to a 386SX (perhaps he doesn't want that known - he might
be waiting to see if anyone complains about it being slower), while he
takes the 386 for himself - at least for the time being.

  I'm short on time for details right now, but your *lastname reserves
a pointer, as you probably know, but doesn't point it to anything.  You have
to use one of the memory allocation functions in C - check out alloc() or
I seem to recall malloc() but it is not in the original K&R book.
  The amt of mem you'd alloc is the length of the name you're getting -
then you'd put the pointer in the structure.  It might save a LITTLE space,
but it depends upon the efficiency of the memory allocation function
implementation (how many bytes of overhead per allocation request, and
whether the allocation routine is "granular" at link time - i.e. whether
if you don't use alloc, you will get it anyway, or if by using it, you
get it included at link time.  If alloc is, say, 512 bytes of code, you
have to consider that in your overall savings.  But this is only an exercise,
so that isn't a factor.  You DO need to get comfy with pointers and mem
allocation.
No dup. chars.
