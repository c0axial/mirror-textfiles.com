]Ward; Sorry to her about your Dad, my mother past away 3/14/90 after
a 6 month 'bout with cancer (Fine before that) It hurts.
I am still in recovery from my plane crash last July, just had more
surgury about 3 weeks ago...they removed about 5.5lbs of steel from
my right leg (pins, rods, plates, screws) now just the left leg to
go. Sorry again about your father, I feel for you, am available to
help in any way. Talking
to you soon.

Msg 43500 is 03 line(s) on 04/21/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to EARL HALL re: R/16550 FIFO ENABLE

 Thanks, that will help! I would think the features of the UART would
be automatically enabled since the 16550 is compatible, but alas.
 So that ZIP file from Plantz would be very useful - thanks!
