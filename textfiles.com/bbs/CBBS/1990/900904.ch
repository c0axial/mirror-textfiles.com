 Mr. Nicad (for others looking on: see msg 43908) came thru! There is
no minimum order charge, and the prices are great - $3 for sub-C solder
tab NiCads.
 I ordered 2 I need and a few spares.
 Thanks again for the advice.

 CBBS had quite a few callers, but then the motherboard died, and
the replacement motherboard seems only to accept 2400 baud calls. It
must be a timing thing, and I'm working on it. Could be we'll never
quite recover those we lost by having 300, 1200, and 9600 not working
here for a while (assuming I get it fixed!)

Msg 43923 is 09 line(s) on 09/03/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: CBBS 300-9600 BACK!

 Oops! The modem was set for "restore from non volatile RAM" and
when put back to "restore from ROM" (at power up) that solved it! Whew!
 QUESTION: How important is 9600 baud here? Seems Chinet could benefit
from its availability, and a Practical Peripherals MNP 2400 would only
cost $200 from ElekTek.
 Here's a list of 9600 users:

 Please pass the word! I feel we lost a lot of callers when that
happened!

Msg 43925 is 02 line(s) on 09/03/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: ROY LIPSCOMB?

 Anyone know Roy's phone #? Could you give him a call & tell him thanks
for reporting the CBBS problem, and that it is fixed? Appreciate it!

Msg 43926 is 02 line(s) on 09/03/90 from BENJAMIN COHEN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/ROY LIPSCOMB?

Not quite sure how to reach him; saw him at the CACHE-FEST; I'll see
if he's called Antelope Freeway lately.and leave a message there.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/REVIEWS

The problem of reviewers being sued is real, but not too bad. Consumers
Union took Bose to the US Supreme Court after Bose sued over what was in
a review. Reviewers can get in trouble by libelling someone; it's not
hard to avoid the problem, but can get touchy sometimes. The editorial
integrity problem is another problem, but equally real. One 'magazine'
was given a computer an software which it used to desktop publish the
magazine. Guess what? A favorable review and several favorable mentions.
Reviewers who receive stuff free always have a conscience problem; how
do you slam the hand that feeds you? If you're not up to it, get out of
it.

Msg 43928 is 12 line(s) on 09/04/90 from ANDREW DECKOWITZ
to ALL re: WINDOWS 3.0 AND NOVELL NETWARE

Just a quick note - I've been installing Windows 3.0 on our Netware 2.15
network, and have found an incompatibility that can be quite irritating
if you do not know about it in advance. The Windows package claims
compatibility with Netware 2.10 or greater (and 386). This is true - with
one caveat: for full functionality, including any use of full 386 mode,
Windows REQUIRES version 3.01 of the Netware shell (IPX/SPX and NETx) -
which is only commercially available with Netware 386! The solution is to
request the updated shell programs (AS WELL AS UPDATED UTILITY PROGRAMS)
from your Novell dealer. If you have a service agreement (or possibly
even if not) you should receive the new software free of charge. Our
updated drivers just arrived by US Mail - I'll let you know how they work.

Well, as I said in message 43916, I couldn't remember the name of
the file to edit to get rid of unwanted program icons. The correct
name of the file is PROGMAN.INI.This file contains all of the
names of the programs which require WIN to display a selection/
execution icon, (such as the dreaded TOOLBOOK icon). Deleting the
name of the application from the file eliminates the display of
the icon. PROGMAN.INI is in the \WINDOWS directory. Have fun.
