Msg 43883 is 08 line(s) on 08/20/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: UPGRADE AST?

 Anyone out there making an AST Premium motherboard upgrade? I know I
could get a new "clone case", but I kind of like to keep the old one.
 Alternatively, anyone know if an AST Premium power supply is compatible
- i.e. will fit in - an AT type case? I seem to recall someone saying an
AST Premium power supply could be upgraded with a "normal" AT power supply.
 Thanks!
 P.S. are any of the 25 or 33mhz 386 replacement motherboards Class B
certified? (or perhaps it is impossible to certify just a board?)

 I was told that ALL the components in my Touche system were
Class B, but the reason the machine DIDN'T bear a Class B rating
was that if they make ANY change at all to the system, they have
to get it RE-certified.
 All I can tell you is that I had it about 12 feet away from
my 27" Sony (which is on cable), and the Sony didn't even wince
when I operated the machine. (The sucker even has big (pencil
will fit in them!) holes in the back of the case, and it didn't
seem to matter.
 I was over at jcs' house, and he has a hard and a floppy drive
OUTSIDE his AT&T 6300's case, and the ONLY TVI he got was when
he operated the floppy.
 I think it was Karl Botts who told me (mebbe it was Paul Guthrie)
on chinet, that he has the TOP of HIS 33mhz case off, and the TVI
is non-existant.
 A TV repair friend had told me a 33mhz would blow away the horiz-
ontal sync on TVs, but this does not appear to be the case.
 I dunno. Mebbe there is some snot-nose five houses away who is
getting his rabbit-eared 13" screwed up. With all the CB boosters
that dorks in my neighborhood run, I don't think anything I can emit
would make a difference. In any event, it doesn't look like my
"Class B capable, but not Class B Certifiable" 33mhz doesn't do diddly
to TV sets.

Ward, don't miss the upcoming RADIO EXPO 90 in Grayslake. It's always
been a goody!

 I had the problem logging on too. Guess it had something to
do with the breaddown of the system. Had such problems before also.

to ALL re: REVIEWS

 Read in the latest Dr Dobbs that in July a ruling went into effevt
where software companies can sue reviewers for any negative (proveable)
comments about their software. Guess we can't believe reviews NOW.
