Msg 43219 is 11 line(s) on 02/15/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: SMALL PC?

 Just for "grins", I'd like to put together a small - VERY small -
PC, to replace the "Ward Board" CBBS. I'd like to convert CBBS from
ASM to PC C, with an eye on keeping it somewhat device independent to
be able to port to Randy's Unix system.
 I'm thinking of one of those single-board PCs, such as the Ampro
Little Board. I'd need CGA/composite to drive a cheap 7" monitor that's
now on it, serial for the modem, and one slot for a network board so
I could back it up across the network. I'd put it in an old full-height
drive case, with a half height floppy and half-height hard disk.
 Is there such a thing - particularly with the one slot?
 Tnx!

Msg 43220 is 06 line(s) on 02/15/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/SMALL PC?

My guess is that the cheapest way to go about it would be to use an old
XT motherboard. Not as small as a Little Board (but I think you'd need at
least one auxilliary board in that case anyway, and I haven't heard of them
having slots). As long as it doesn't have to be portable (portable system
with a network card? Actually I guess that makes sense if it's only
connected to the network when it needs to be backed up).

to TROY TUCKER re: R/MULTILINES

Computer Direct has eight lines I believe. Their number is (708) 382-3270
and they offer want you are talking about, plus Commodore, Apple, IBM, etc.
message bases and file section. Plus you can place an order through their
on-line catalog!

No this isn't really a plug, I am a customer like everybody else, just
trying to be helpful!

Enjoy! <BW>

Msg 43222 is 06 line(s) on 02/15/90 from ED FOSTER
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/WANT TO CODE?

 If you have KEDIT version 4.0 you can do some of the things you want
right within the text editor. For example, use a macro to set the selection
level for each line equal to the number of blanks at the beginning of the
line. Then you would see only lines starting in column 1. If you SET
DISPLAY 3 * you would see lines indented 3 or more spaces. It would be
crude, but it might work.

Msg 43223 is 12 line(s) on 02/15/90 from JIM PRICE
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: XMODEM

Ward, if memory serves me correctly, you're the inventor of MODEM,
MODEM7, and XMODEM (i.e., the grandpaw of pc-pc communication).
I downloaded from some board n Chicago (several years ago), I think
this one the spec for XMODEM. Is it available for downloading, or
could you steer me towards a good source for a copy of the spec. I am
also interested in the later derivatives (YMODEM, IMODEM, ZMODEM, etc.)
I have been working with PCs for a relatively short time (since 1984),
and have in my spare time developed an interest in data communications.
My eventual intent is to develop a protocol that will support a service
similar to Prodigy (i.e., interactive graphics), perhaps a subset of
the X11 protocol, custom tailored for modem communication. Anyway
thanks. Jim Price, Irving, TX

to WARD re: DESKJET STUFF

I've been finishing up this issue of DeskNews and tried to track a
few things down. I call Mile High Engineering about their "permanent"
ink. They claimed its not permanent, just better than HPs. They sent
me a refill kit for free to evaluate. The stuff is pricey at $19.95 for
2 refills, but if you don't have access to a syringe its a good way to
get 2 refillers! I'll be playing with it to see if it's really any better.
Do you want one of the refill bottles? Only condition is you have to
report back on how well it does. I also called the author of DeskJet
Unlimited (new book) and they are sending a free copy. "The power of the
press."
