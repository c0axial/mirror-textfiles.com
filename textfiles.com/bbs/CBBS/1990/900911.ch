  Thanks for the info!  Someone must have gotten the # somewhere, he's
now called in (at 1200).
  I appreciate your integrity in feeling that validation #'s are
confidential!  I wish everyone to whom you gave your # or addr felt that
way!  For one thing, there'd be about 8 magazines that I wouldn't have
"had" to cancel, and I could answer my phone again (haven't answered it
in about 2 years since Michael Cane in his "Computer Phone Book", and
"Commodore Magazine" published it as a BBS (which it of course never has
been) ;-).  I use it for my OUTgoing line only now.

to ALL re: FRIENDS IN ATLANTA??

Hi all!
   I just moved to Atlanta from Rogers Park, and thought I'd send
an electronic postcard!  (Hi to Ward, Joe Jesson, and all)
Anyone know of good Atlanta local BBSs?  I have a short list, but
haven't tried any yet.
    Also, does anyone have contacts in Atlanta??  I'm looking for
a full-time DP position; either UNIX/C coding, or in marketing/sales.
Am also looking for statistical and systems consulting contracts.
If you have any suggestions, please let me know!
    Thanks in advance, and warm greetings from the land o' peaches!!

The solitaire game is great!  Rather addictive; the might as well as
change the game's name to "Kiddie Cocaine."
No dup. chars.
