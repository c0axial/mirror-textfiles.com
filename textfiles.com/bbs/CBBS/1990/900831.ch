]Ward- Prevous reminded me that when you first installed the keywords
list you put "retrieve" (I think) in with both the correct and the
incorrect, but popular spelling (retreive)and was gonna comment that
it was a good idea.  Just looked at the keywords list and the
second spelling is gone. Owell....

to ALL re: SOLDER-TAB NI-CADS?

 When one of my "appliances" dies - due to a dead ni-cad, I just go down
to my local (6 mi. away) hobby shop, and buy one.
 Not any more, sigh! Went there Sat, they stopped carrying them!
 Any ideas where you can get solder tab NiCads? I got a couple AAs at a
HamFest, but at the time didn't need any C-size, which is what I'm looking
for now for my DustBuster.
 I've tried soldering to regular ni-cads, but haven't been too successful.

Msg 43903 is 02 line(s) on 08/26/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/SOLDER-TAB NI-CADS?

You might check out mail-order surplus places like All Electronics or Marli
P. Jones (whose latest catalog doesn't list what you want, but.).

to ALL re: WINDOWS 3.0

Anybody have any experiences with Windows 3.0? I just got it
and note with some surprise that my ADA compiler will run just
fine under it, (it's a 386-to-DOS compiler). The solitaire
game is outstanding! Quattro Pro also seeme to run ok. Any other
brave souls tried ot out yet???

Msg 43905 is 07 line(s) on 08/28/90 from AL HIGGINS
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/SOLDER-TAB NI-CADS?

What about placing the ni-cad in one of the holders you use for charging the
ni-cads. They have the spring clip terminals used on a 9 volt battery.
You can purchase the 9 volt connectors at most eletronic stores for less
than a buck. Iv'e done this on battery operated eqpt. and allows me
to be able to change out the individual battery, or as a bettery pack.
Now if you really want solder tabs let me know where you found some as
I could use a few! Good luck.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: AST PREMIUM UPGRADE

It is my understanding that AST uses what it calls CUPID architecture
that allows any one of their Premium computers to be upgraded to their
latest and greatest 486.

Well, not this weekend any where around here. I'll check and get back with
you though.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/SOLDER-TAB NI-CADS?

Ward, call MR. NICAD at (608)643-3194. He also shows up at all the hamfests.
or another good source is BATTERY-TECH (800)442-4275

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: LOGGING ON AT 1200 BAUD!

I use different computers to log on here all the time. It appears that
1200 baud isn't working. All I get when logged on is massive delete
characters coming with no let up. I believe 300 baud might be the same.

But 2400 baud does work. I bet a lot of those who call at 300 and 1200 baud
may think the board is down. Or did you just lock them out?
dup. chars.
