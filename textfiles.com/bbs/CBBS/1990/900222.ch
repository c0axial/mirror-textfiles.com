 It will be at DePaul, Sat the 24th, Lewis Center Room 1001 - that
is at 25 east jackson. Random Access starts at 9:30, generally goes
for an hour, then the guest speaker - as yet unnamed. If there is none,
then they'll do my favorite topic - an entire meeting of random access.

 I still get some noise on my screen, but apparently little is sent
to CBBS. My modem does not have MNP as far as I can tell. Could it be that
Ma I mean Daughter Bell fixed something?

to ALL re: DEAD MODEM

 I have seen a book called "100 Things to do with a Dead Cat" but what
can you do with a dead 1200 baud modem. It would cost $85.00 to get it
fixed, versus $50.00 for a new one at ELEK-TEK.
 (If anyone wants it, I'll let it go rather cheap.)

to BILL MATTSON re: R/8-INCH DRIVE JUMPER SETTINGS

What I have is an 820-II, Bill. I'm not totally familiar with the
history, but I believe that the -II was the upgrade. The original
820 (820-I ?) had only single sided diskettes, but mine came with a Shugart
851 double sided drive and a 10 meg hard drive. The 851 works fine in
double sided mode. Since I raised my first question, another friend, Ed
Fanta, gave me some tips on his setup with the same drives. I've had
partial additional success. The machine now recognizes and formats both
sides of the diskette with the Mitsubishi drives, but the LED stays on after
the drive is accessed, and I cannot remove the diskette from the drive witho
ut shutting off the machine. Obviously, I'm not there yet. One can only
take so much of the old routine without a break (install, check, remove, c
change jumpers, reinstall, .). I'm taking my break and hoping that my
comments will ring a bell with someone. Thanks for your interest.

The first thing I would do, assuming you have an external modem, would
be to hook up a voltmeter to the power-pack plug (the one that goes into
the modem) and see if its still working. If not, you can pick up a
new power pack or about $5. If that's not the problem, what $ would you
be asking for the modem?

You can call my BBS, The Round Table at 312/777-9480.
After filling out the application go to the (D)oors section
"The Reading Room" There you will find a local and two national BBS lists.

to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/YOUR WP PROBLEM

Thanks for the info.-I knew anything like that would be tricky at
best! I'm not about to mess around with programs like QEMM, etc.,
because I doubt that they provide explicit functions like that.
Isn't video RAM mapped to specific system addresses? My impression
is that's what happens-and if so, rerouting should work. Or is it
that the mapping registers you referred to have special mapping
functions for video writes?? I must confess relative ignorance
about CPU registers. I'm starting to get into asm programming,
in part instigated by this problem and my stubbornness, and I'd
like to at least try to 'fix' this.
I'll keep reading and toying with it, and if you get a sudden
revelation, let me know! Thanks again!

If I remember correctly, it's a 9600bps FAX, with 2400bps modem.
They claim "effective" 4800bps for the modem WITH optional MNP
correction. Who knows?

Msg 43260 is 10 line(s) on 02/21/90 from BILL MATTSON
to GERALD PINE re: R/8-INCH DRIVE JUMPER SETTINGS

I don't have docs on the 851 drive, but on the 800/801 drives there are
a pair of jumpers (or traces) labelled Z and Y. The drives were shipped
(usually) with Z jumpered and Y open. This combo meant the in use LED
was lit by drive select, and the reverse, Y jumpered, Z open meant
the LED lit feom head load (HD LD). On the surface of it this would
not explain the problem, but only point at a symptom if the LED stays lit
also. However, you might try these two jumpers (if they are also on the
851 too), just to see. There may also be some "door open/ door closed"
drive select logic in there too. If you have the docs, check this area.
 Regards.

The 386 mapping registers control what PHYSICAL address gets selecte when
the processor tries to access a LOGICAL address. For example, an EGA
card will always have memory at physical address A0000 hex, i.e. whenever
an address in that range appears on the bus, the card's memory gets
selected. The mapping registers could be set so that when the processor
tries to access B0000 hex (where a Hercules card's memory normally
goes), A0000 would go out on the bus, thereby rerouting an attempted
write to the Hercules over to the EGA. The real situation is a bit
more complicated, but.
