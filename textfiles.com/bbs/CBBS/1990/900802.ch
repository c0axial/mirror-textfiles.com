Msg 43855 is 15 line(s) on 07/31/90 from ED FOSTER
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/WHADDAYAKNOW?

 Don't get me wrong, I'm a Michael Feldman fan also. But, as Stan Freburg
said years ago, on the radio the pictures are better. I know exactly what
a solar-powered beanie looks like, but I suspect I'd be disappointed if I
actually saw one.
 As a youngster I was an avid reader of Science Fiction, and whenever a
book I had read was made into a movie I would expectantly attend and then
wonder if the director had read the same book. Of course, the technical
side of movies in those days was pretty dismal (remember the cardboard
computers?).
 The only movie-named-for-a-book I really enjoyed was "The Black Stallion",
which I took my kids to. They liked it too, but not as much as I did.
I think the reason was that the director spent more effort on portraying
the mood than the story. But then, that was the case with "The Martian
Chronicles", and I still found the movie a bit tedious, perhaps because
it was made for TV.
