 You sure there's nothing fancy in the BIOS of your machine? I upgraded
my PC to a Bullet 286, and it includes BIOS based disk cacheing, using an
unusual memory mapping scheme. Specifically it has a "real" meg of
memory, addressed from 0-1M, and the memory above 640K is operated by a
"switch" that selects either the bus for everything from 640-1M, OR, the
built-in memory. I like the idea, but I lose interrupts at 9600, because
of the time the funny memory is switched in while doing bios-based cacheing.
 P.S. I'm sure it is not a full 384K since there IS the bios based cacheing,
etc.

Microsoft C 6 (and maybe earlier) has an "isatty( )" function which
distinguishes between character devices ("TTYs") and block devices (i.e.,
disk files).

#include <io.h>

if(isatty(fileno(stdin) ) )
 printf("stdin is a character device") ;
else
 printf("stdin is actually a file") ;

to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/LOST INTERRUPTS

 Well, the problem shows up both with the 8250 in COM1 (not socketed)
and with the 16450 in COM2 (socketed), so it's doubtful that it's one
chip or the other. This happens with my Courier 2400e, my PacComm TNC,
and with a friend's HST.
 The problem is definitely an overrun error, according to DSZ, which made
me think it was an interrupt problem originally. Don't know if it's a
defective interrupt controller, as that's part of the "G2" chip set
(probably a C&T/VLSI clone set, from Hong Kong). No real way to check
that, as I can't come up with documentation on it, although I suppose I
could whip together some code of some sort to do normal PIC programming
and see what I could find out.
 Interesting manifestation, incidentally. about the time I got this
286 board and started using it, my Courier lost the ability to handle
hardware handshaking on DSR and CTS. If I set either the &S1 (modem
controls DSR) or &H1/&H3 (CTS flow control), it slows the modem down
considerably, and the modem won't echo characters sent to it, even
though DTR and RTS are set properly, etc. Turn off those switches and
it works just fine.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/LOST INTERRUPTS

 Well, I can't be entirely sure that there isn't anything like you
suggest in this BIOS (it's an AMI BIOS), but I don't think there is,
or at least it's not mentioned in the manual (the first I ever got without
schematics!). However, I have tried disabling both my extended memory
cache and my extended memory RAMdisk (at the same time), without effect.
I had thought that that might have a significant effect, what with the
machine having to switch into protected mode to access the memory above
640K and then switch back to real mode, but it seems to make no difference
at all (which I find to be very suspicious!).

The Turbo Pascal, and perhaps the Microsoft C sound tempting. What kind
of prices are you thinking? (If you prefer voice to a msg, call me at

Msg 43565 is 19 line(s) on 05/11/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to DOS DEVELOPERS re: NEW DEVELOPMENT TOOL

I'm developing a product to make the life of independent DOS software
developers a little easier. While nearing release, input from a few
more testers is desired.
 Its central function performs the following disk distribution
tasks: 1) It interrogates the requested drive. When it senses a disk
has been inserted, it will (if necessary) format it. If already
formatted and containing files, the user is queried about how to
proceed. 2) A product's files are copied or unarchived (any
compression program). 3) A registration number of the user's creation
is added to selected file(s) on the output disk. If desired, the
number is auto-incremented (but is editable at any time). The
numbering algogrithm is entirely transparent to virtually any .COM or
any .EXE file, yet if desired is accessible by that program. (The
number is encrypted, decipherable only be the author. Attempted
alteration is detected.) Lastly, a licensing data entry feature can
save data in a variety of formats for use by virtually any DB, WP or
spreadsheet program. After this cycle is completed, the user may
process a new disk simply by inserting it (or press ESCape if done).

Msg 43566 is 16 line(s) on 05/11/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to DOS DEVELOPERS re: <CONT.>

 All features are optional, may be varied for each product, are
always editable and may be interspersed by any other commands of your
choice. Unlimited command-sequence files may be saved to disk.
 Most features are in place and have undergone initial testing.
Now, we're looking for a few more testers. If interested, obtain an
alpha-test copy of REG-nn.LZH (where "nn" is replaced by the latest
version number) in the C1: directory on The Advocate RCP/M,
312.939.4411 (24 hrs., 8/n/1, 300/1200/2400, central Chicago) or call
voice at 312.939.3300 (work days). Or, to receive each significant
alpha-test release by mail and automatically register for the first
formal release (late May), send $25 to: Advocate Enterprises, Ltd.,
899 S. Plymouth Ct., Suite 504, Chicago 60605. Specify 3.5" or 5.25"
format. This prerelease registration amount is significantly less than
the anticipated retail price and will maximize the opportunity to have
the product develop in ways that best serve your interests. We place
high value on tester input.

 Does anyone know how I access a copy of Wordstar for a NEC PC-8800
computer. I had a copy of wordstar ver. 3.0 for the machine, but it got
damaged before I could make a copy. The PC has an intel 8080 micropro-
cessor, and was made in 1979. Please excuse my use of antiquated techno-
logy, but the machine was donated to the school where I am employed. I
appreciate any help!

 Thanks for the suggestion, Mike. I did try slowing the machine to its
lowest speed (6 MHz), but it didn't make a difference. Appreciate the
thought, thank you.

We have a Novell ELS-I system running arcnet and Paradise VGA Plus (8-bit)
boards. Is anyone else running Arcnet & Paradise VGA boards ???
We seem to have a lockup whenever a video mode function is executed.
 like just a DOS MODE CO80 type command.
It could be conflicts with interrupts (don't think so) or RAM (??) or ???
Any users that ARE or ARE NOT running with Paradise VGA and ARCNET ????

Yes, I am still interested in buying a true blue Hayes 1200 baud external
modem. I did locate one for $50. for myself at the Chicago Computer
Exchange. But, I have friends in my industry who would like to run this
same quirky program and they have now asked me to look for them (since I
am the only one into the BBS world). You can call me at 312-929-2200 or
leave your phone number here for me to call.

The program not only requires a true blue Hayes 1200 baud external
modem, it requires it have a serial number in a certain range! The
programmer eveidently wrote this whole program based upon a unique
flaw in the Hayes modem and it wasn't until it was too late that he
discovered this one characteristic is not common to all Hayes
compatible modems.

Ward
It's been a while since I';ve been on this BBS. I just recieved your message
It was referring to line noise.\ As you can see by this preseeding
line that there is noise. I justy got off with the 2020 bbs for about 40
minutes without any problems. I called CBBS and as soon as I read your
message and was prompted for a response, I recieved some garble. It
i]just happened again. I was wondering if I changed to a 7 bit parity
instead of 8 might help ? There is no graphics on the BBS so E$ I might
be ok to run like that. Any iddeas ?

Msg 43572 is 13 line(s) on 05/12/90 from CLIFF SHARP
to ALL re: COMM PROBS REVISITED

 Well, I've done a little experimental programming and have found
yet another weirdness about all this. I trapped interrupts 8-F (IRQs
0-7) and displayed a character whenever an interrupt occurred here.
I'm *pretty* sure I didn't do anything stupid in the program, but.
If a video access happens during a timer interrupt (IRQ0, INT 8), or
if the machine tries to beep at all while I have interrupts trapped,
the machine locks up totally and completely. If I don't trap the timer
interrupt, everything's fine.
 I removed all TSRs that trap that interrupt (KBFIX and my cache
program), and verified that the ISR is in the DOS area. Also switched
from Phoenix DOS 3.3 to Zenith DOS 3.1 with no effect.
 I'm starting to think that my AMI BIOS is the culprit in both cases!
Anyone care to comment?
