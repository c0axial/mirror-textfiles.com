to ALL re: GOOD NOVELL TAPE DRIVE?

 A friend's network has several hundred megabytes right now, and is
backed up with a 60M drive.
 They're probably going to have a gigabyte or two before too long, so
they'd like to invest in a tape drive that will do a better job of
backing up.
 Any suggestions?

I have heard of that problem about DOS 3.3 not working with certain
Pheonix BIOS. But I don't have an answer for you. Sorry!

Msg 43538 is 16 line(s) on 05/04/90 from JIM POLOUS
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: NOVELL TAPE

Ward,
 We use an ADIC LanBacker 8000 on our 2 server Novell Network. It is a
medium size unit, it uses an 8 bit SCSI and I believe RS-422 interface.
It allows for up to 10 3M tapes (40, 80 or 120 megs each). I believe the
total storage using the maximum is about 2 gig. The software that comes
with it is adaquate and it does support unattended backup and multiple
servers. The drivers for Novell's NBACKUP are available on CompuServe's
NetWire forum. It has been reliable for us, but it will not backup open
files (with either it's own software or NBACKUP). It is a bit slow,
however. I am told that many ADIC tape drives are. I'm not recommended
that your friend get or not get it, because for us it serves us well. We
do two backups per day. A full backup at midnight and an incremental
during the day. And we can specify which tapes to use, so 1-4 can
be for the midnight full backup and 5-6 can be for incremental. And 7-10
can be for our 4:00 AM backup on our 2nd file server. As for how slow,
it took 129 minutes to back up about 280 meg of data.

to ALL re: YOUR OWN TV STATION

Thanks to new FCC rules you can start your own Low Power Television station
and broadcast on standard VHF (2-13) or UHF (14-69) channels, 10-20 miles
coverage. Use your home computer to program. FREE details, just call
(305) 981-8480. Find a clear channel and get on TV !

to TONY ANTONUCCI re: THANKS!

Thanks for the trouble you went to, Tony! It's working just fine. I'm
not sure if it's my imagination or not, but Turbo C seems to be compiling
faster as well - an event I hadn't counted upon. I'll have to look in the
manual to see if it really DOES recognize the 287 or if it's all in my
head. Needless to say, I'm pleased with AutoSketch's performance now too.

I looked on Prodigy for AST's BBS number and can't find it; sorry.

The BBS in C User's Group is "MSC Network". The only number I have is one
listed for this area - 704-0313 -leading me to believe they are handled
by a common carrier. Instructions are: Once connected, press <CR> <CR>
to get the # prompt, then press <X> <CR> to get the * prompt, then
type .vtt to enter the MSC network. Follow the online registration
instructions. Once on line, press EDI for instant access.
 This is the BBS I referred to as promising royalties to the
shareware's author everytime someone downloads a copy of it. I don't
know any more than this; I've never called it. Thought you might be
interested if you write a fair amount of original useful utilities.

The Coprocessor I was talking about in Elek-Tek is the Integrated Information
Technologies 803C87. Speeds are: 16, 20, 25, and 33 MHz. Prices in the
catalog range from $265 for either the 16 or 20 MHz units to $475 for the
33 MHz parts. Looks like about 2-5 times faster than Intel, depending on:
1. The specific math function performed, and
2. If you believe the ad copy.

Thanks again for everything.

Does anyone know where I can get a text file of some pascal code that
would show how to program xmodem, ymodem, or zmodem protocols?

Bob; I have 2 original "true blue" Hayes modems, and would be willing
to sell either or both (I have 3 various 2400 baud modems too)
Leave a msg here if you are interested. The modems are in excellent
shape.

While I'm at it. I have 2 Epson printers for sale. One is an
Epson MX-80 and the other is an FX-80.
Both are in good condition.

Msg 43545 is 08 line(s) on 05/06/90 from TONY ANTONUCCI
to ALL re: SOFTWARE

Come to think of it I have Original software for sale too.
These are usually NOT the most recent versions of software. but
might be just the ticket for students, etc.
For example Microsoft C compiler version 5.1
Turbo Pascal version 4.0
Quattro
etc
All are LEGAL bought copies with original documentation.
