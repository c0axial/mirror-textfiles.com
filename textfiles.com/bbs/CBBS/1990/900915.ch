to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: REVIEWS

Ah, of course when you're hired by someone to write a review, they
SHOULD specify such a policy.  After all, THEY are paying you so
they don't want you to be affected by the manufacturer's blandishments.
At least one magazine I wrote for specified that you had to make
a proposal to them, they would acquire the product, and you were NOT
to contact the source (except to test support).

On the other hand, there are syndicated columnists, who are often
beseiged (well, sometimes beseiged) by manufacturers with offers
or even unsolicited shipments of stuff that they would love to have
reviewed.  They don't have an employer to enforce a standard of
total independence.  And of course there are employers who don't
have such a policy (I hear one PC periodical has its editors acting
as advisors to software houses).

No dup. chars.
