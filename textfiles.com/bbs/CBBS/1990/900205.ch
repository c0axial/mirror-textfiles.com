to ALL re: TRY 9600 HST HERE?

 The 9600 baud modem is back on line. I can't connect to it. Randy
SAYS it says "connect 9600", but I get nothing.
 Then again, my 9600 doesn't connect to ANYTHING with ARQ (MNP) so I
suspect a bug in MY modem - perhaps CBBS' also? Could someone please
try calling in here at 9600 with an HST set to 9600? Thanks. (For
those of you wondering why I said 9600 twice, it is because there is
such a thing as coming in at 14.4K, but CBBS isn't set for that).
 Thanks!

to HOWARD HOYT re: R/BODOT TO ASCII CONVERSION

(correct spelling is "Baudot")
The actual conversion from Baudot to ASCII is pretty easy. First, you
have to remember that Baudot has two "shift states." In one state,
codes represent letters; in the other, they represent numbers or punctuation.
Two of the Baudot codes (letter shift and figure shift) are reserved
for switching between these states. A routine to convert a Baudot
character to ASCII would look like this:
toascii(code)
int code;
{static int state=0;
 if (code==FIGURESHIFT)
 {state=32;
 return(0);
 }
 else if (code==LETTERSHIFT)
 {state=0;
 return(0);
 }
 else
 return(asctab[code+state]);
}
where asctab[] is a 64-element table consisting of the ASCII values
corresponding to the 32 Baudot codes, first in the letters state and
then in the figures state. You'll have to get a Baudot table to look
up the actual character codes.

If the ultimate purpose of this is to allow PCs to communicate with
TDDs, remember that TDD modems are NOT signal-compatible with standard
computer modems.

to HOWARD HOYT re: <CONT>

TDDs use a HALF-DUPLEX FSK modulation method. Half-duplex is used here in
its true meaning: only one side can be sending carrier at a time.
The parties to the conversation have to "hand off."
The point of all this is that merely writing a program to translate
ASCII to Baudot and vice-versa will NOT enable a PC to talk to a TDD
without special hardware. There are some modems that will work with
the TDD modulation method; they actually take ASCII input and do the
translation themselves, as well as the appropriate FSK modulation.
Unfortunately, they're rather expensive and while they can also function
as full-duplex ASCII modems, they're limited to 300 baud.

to ALL re: NEED ORIG IBMPC MOTHERBD

I am looking for your old, used, discarded (but working) true blue
IBM PC motherboard (original model 5150). Prfer the "PC 2" which
is the 256K motherboard, but will consider the older "PC 1" which
was socketed for 64K. I do not need the RAM. This is for an IBM PC
for my kids, so I don't have to take my bulletin board offline every
time they want to use the PC. Best way to get me is to leave a
message on my BBS, Discovery Place at 708-383-6335 as I don't get on
here very often. I also have a few items laying around that you may
want/need as part of a trade - 4 floppy ctrller (IBM), Epson MX100
for parts(?), internal Hayes 1200B, PC DOS 3.3 shrink wrapped.
- Thanks, Mike

does anybody know where i can get a good deal
on 3 1/2 inch drives for my ibm clone?

That board also says that it can serve as a 4800 MNP? any input. Their
prices I see are for quantity (2?). I have some interest in a FAX
board. AH, I'm reading the send only details, don't see the send and
receive, which would seem to be a better choice.Leave me a message
if you find out anything more.

If you can wait until February 25, you can go to the College of
DuPage. The Computer Central Show is held there about 10 times per
year. I got a high density 3.5" drive for $80.00 for my machine. The low
density drives were anywhere from $60+. Both new and used hardward and software
are sold there. The admission is $5, it starts at 9:30, come early or
you'll miss the bargains. The show is held in the sport arena, you
can enter on the south east corner of the campus. If you need any
other information, let me know.
