Msg 43316 is 05 line(s) on 03/04/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to SHERMAN re: YOUR NAME

 CBBS seems to have a bug whereby it doesn't remember you because of
the algorithm for storing the name - the ',' in 'sherman day, jr.' seems
to throw off the hashing algorithm. Interesting that a bug should show
up in software that has been running "stable" for years. ;-)
 Sorry for the inconvenience. Just leave the comma out of your name.

Msg 43317 is 05 line(s) on 03/05/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to BILL PRECHT re: R/251-1 NOISE

The noise the 251 makes at power down comes from the spring-driven
automatic parking mechanism. The noise at powerup is from the controller
calibrating itself, which involves moving the head to cylinder zero
(if I remember right) and trying to move it further and realizing that
it won't go any further.

Msg 43318 is 05 line(s) on 03/05/90 from GARY BUNTENBACH
to ALL re: BBS - NEW

There is a new BBS for the WILL and KANKAKEE counties starting up
3/3/90. The hours are Mon-Fri 4PM - 9PM Sat-Sun 9AM - 9PM
We can use all the legitimate uploads you can spare to help
us start up! If you have the time call WILKAN BBS at
708-258-9248

Msg 43319 is 10 line(s) on 03/05/90 from BILL WOLFF
to GLENN POPELKA re: R/ACCURATE AT TIMING (HOW?)

For all the trouble it sounds like you are having through software. And
please note I have not been keeping up on this subject correctly. But I
would just do all the work through hardware. Adding interrupts and a
extra clock is child's play for an engineer. Under ten bucks worth of
parts should do it I think. Unless I am missing something you said!

I am always fighting with computers that lack higher resolution. But the
worst is timing resolution.

Hope this gives you some ideas? <BW>
