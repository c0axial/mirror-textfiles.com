to STAN BEGGS re: R/PRINT RE-DIRECTION

Yep. One I found on Compuserve that seems to work quite well for
redirecting printer to disk is LPTX. I've also tried "SPOOL", but it
locks up too often. You should be able to find LPTX on boards like
Gene Plantz'.

Msg 43391 is 10 line(s) on 03/26/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to BILL WOLFF re: R/DBASE II AND III

 I like the basic features of Dbase III, but as implemented by Fox Base.
Fox Base can be had for $195, and the PRO version is probably not more
than $100 more. It is an EXCELLENT program. The screen designer is quite
nice, and you can design an application with simple add, search, stored
queries, etc, by just designing the database, then the screen. Also,
if you're going to get into consulting, you can buy an unlimited run-time
license and then you can use your programs on more than one machine, such
as a "client's" machine.
 But I'd say go with III vs II - I think the screen designer is better,
but I've used Fox so much I've even erased Dbase from my machines.

to JIM SACKETT re: LINE NOISE

Sorry, I don't know "what's the scoop". I am isolated from line noise
since I'm using MNP into CBBS, so it catches and fixes all errors.
 We SHOULD be better off than we were - due to having a relatively
new and modern modem installed (USR HST 9600). Sorry for the problems!
Do they get any better if you re-dial or is it always bad?
 Anyone else have comments on line noise since we got our modem back
from USR?
 Thanks.

Msg 43393 is 05 line(s) on 03/26/90 from ALEX ZELL
to WARD re: R/LINE NOISE

Not a bit of line noise tonight here for me. Other days I get some.
Same situation with chinet, which sits on the same table as this BBS.
I believe the variables depend upon which circuits are grabbed when
we call, as you learned a few years ago when you and Randy were able
to isolate a defective circuit in a central office.

Msg 43394 is 08 line(s) on 03/26/90 from ALAN CAPESIUS
to ALL re: MEMORY CHIP PINOUTS NEEDED

I could use some help here.
I have some memory modules I need pinouts for. The units are made by I
believe Fairchild MB85206-12 is the module number and each module has 4
81256 memory chips on it.
Does anyone have pinouts for either the module or the chips.
The 81256 are in 18 pin rectangular packages (not DIPS but pins on all four
edges.
Thanks for the help.

Msg 43397 is 09 line(s) on 03/27/90 from JIM POLOUS
to COLIN SHROEDER re: SPEAR TECHNOLOGY

We were going to buy a large order of computers for our users, 286 based
without hard disks. As we are non-profit, we generally provide specifications
and then call up a dozen or so retailers or wholesalers and see what they
can give us. It boiled down to Spear and Packard Bell. We took the Packard
Bell, as it was slightly less expensive than the Spear. I've heard mixed
responses about the Spears, but then the quality control probably could
be better on the Packard Bell's. out of 42 12 Mhz 286 machines, 7 failed
while still in warranty (fortunately), 3 had minor flaws and 2 were DOA.

to ALL re: HAVE CLIPPER/ WILL DEVELOP

Need a custom database application? Staring at your machine
waiting for an interpreted dBase program to finish? Got a
program that needs changes, but the programmer vanished last
year? If so, you need to talk to me. I have the tools and
background to solve your problems quickly and at a very
competitive price. Need something more than a typical database
application? I can create C and assembler extensions for almost
any task. Communications, networks, you name it.

to BILL WOLFF re: R/DBASE II/III

dBASE II files can indeed be converted to dBASE III (& III+) files
without a lot of grief. Check the manual; or, you might call over to
THE ADVOCATE-NOWAR, 312.939.4411, 24 hrs., 300-1200-2400, 8-N-1 (Loop
area). Several callers there do such conversions on a regular basis.
You could get some tips, or high someone for a nominal fee.

to STAN BEGGS re: LPTX

We have a copy over on The Advocate (contact info in preceding msg). Try
GO B4: after exiting to the operating system from the message base program.
If not there, try OFFLINE LPTX*.*. BTW, my experience has been somewhat
different than that of Ward. I've had regular lock-ups <with> LPTX.
No doubt it has a whole lot to do with what applications you use it. (My
most extensive use-and problems-were using it with SuperCalc for a
client.) Good luck.
