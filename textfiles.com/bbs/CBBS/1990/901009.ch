  Not sure where I have that info - but yes, it is "Disk Drive Repair
Service", in Beaverton, OR.  They were just bought out, but I think the
name is the same or similar.
  Oh, just thought: they might be in my pocket memo: Rats, nope.
  Oh, a return addr on a box!  Yep!

Thanks for the tirade!  What I really want is a program generator.  I
don't mind doing some coding and tweaking, but I have NO library of
canned routines, don't have the time or inclination to hand-code data
entry screens, validation tests, output formats, etc etc etc.  I don't
want to reinvent the wheel.  I have a straightforward two-file problem
(a donor tracking system) but there a lots of details and features to
include.

In a nutshell, I want something E-A-S-Y.
No dup. chars.
