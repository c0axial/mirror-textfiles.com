 I've long used "The 8086 book", by Rector & Alexy, but I bought it in
'81, so there should be something newer - probably a 286 book. Do you
live in or commute to the city? It should be worth your while to check
out Krochs, B. Dalton's, or one of the software-only book stores, and
just see what's on the shelf.

Magazine. I am a DOS 4.01 user and would like to fit your COMMAND.COM /
Disk space zap to this version.
 Could you give me some insight into how you located the proper
location to zap so that I might find the equivalent offsets for my
version of COMMAND.COM ?
 I am not asking you to build me a custom zap, just some
guidance.
Thank you,

You should start with Intel's handbook on its microcontroller series; I
think the current title is "embedded controller handbook" though it might
be "microcontroller handbook"; the latest one I have is 1986. That will
cover the 8048 and 8051 series, as well as the 8096 series. I'm not really
aware of all that much in the way of third-party books on Intel
microcontrollers. The Intel books should be enough to get you started if
you're familiar with the Motorola 6805 or 6801 series (there are major
architectural differences between these and Intel's microcontrollers; the
Motorola parts have more "computer-like" instruction sets whereas the Intel
parts have more special-purpose instructions (and more registers). The
8051 series has a more pleasant architecture (for example, it uses relative
jumps whereas the 8048 uses page-based jumps) than the 8048).
I'm quite familiar with both processors, with several commercial designs
under my belt. If you want to talk, voice phone is 708-251-5787.

You can give a call to a BBS I run and do an automated search through
about a half-dozen BBS lists for all records containing area code 815.
Call The Advocate/NOWAR, 312.939.4411, 24 hrs., 8/n/1 (central Chicago).
Exit the message-base program with the main-menu 'C' function, then type
SEARCH. Select the 'BBS Lists' options and enter '815' at the 'Search for?'
prompt, pressing ENTER at all other prompts. Matching records will be
displayed nonstop to the console, so be prepared to capture 'em. (Note:
DON'T type the quote marks used above.) Good luck.

 Glad to hear you squeezed out of a bad situation! I also appreciate
the info on M.I.S.-but I'm not really involved in purchasing, so I'll

insulating washers on the motherboard mounting screws (translates as
"the motherboard was shorting out!")-so now all's well, the machine's
running UNIX and DOS w/o any problem, and I think I'll keep it.

 I'm afraid you won't find much Apple information here, since
it's not SUPPORTED here! (See "CBBS Policy" by using the "b"
command.)
 About the only Apple items you'd find here would be realted
to Apples running CP/M (just about dead), or Unix on Macs (and
we don't get much of that, either).
 Try modemming into 312-776-5561 (Stillwaters BBS), and getting
their Chicago-area BBS listing.
 CBBS is (mostly) a DOS board now, along with related computer
hardware topics.
