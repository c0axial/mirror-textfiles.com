to JIM POLOUS re: R/ALPHA TAPE BACKUP

WhaddyaCare if the backup uses irq 3 and 4 - you're not modemming when
you back up anyway, right? Or was there a conflict like blowing your
mouse driver?
 Thanks!
 P.S. talked to Mike Warot tonight but forgot to talk to him about this
topic. He's been quite interested, and has a large hard disk and no
practical way to back it up.

to ALAN CAPESIUS re: R/HP DESKJET FOR SALE

I think your price is out of line (sadly, as a fellow DeskJet owner).
 Why? Because the new DeskJet PLUS sells for $650 with a $150 rebate!
That means you can buy a DJ+ for the price you're asking for a used
DeskJet. A used Deskjet was for sale on Compuserve for $350.

to ALL re: TAPE BACKUP

Yup. it killed the mouse driver allright, I didn't think that the
problem was with interrupts, so I went out and replaced my mouse with a
track ball. That didn't work either, and then I pulled the backup board.
Voila!
