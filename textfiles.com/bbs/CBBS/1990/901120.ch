Msg 44136 is 14 line(s) on 11/10/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to JAMES SCHMIDT re: R/8086 DISPLAY 32BIT #

You can convert the digits in left-to-right order by successively dividing
by 1000000000, 100000000, etc., printing the QUOTIENT and making the
REMAINDER the "working" value.  In pseudo-code:
work:=number
divisor:=1000000000
while divisor>0
  digit:=work/divisor
  print the digit
  work:=work mod divisor ;i.e. the remainder from the above division
  divisor:=divisor/10
endwhile
Note that this will give you all 10 digits.  You probably want to suppress
leading zeros; if "digit" comes out as zero then display a space unless
1) You've already displayed a non-zero digit or 2) "divisor"=1.

Eric,
        Thanks for the information. This confirms that my original
algorithm is somewhat correct. The problem I was having concerned
32 bit division. With the help of people like yourself and Cliff
Sharp (Msg # 44135) I have all the information I need to proceed
in this exercise.
Thanks again,

Msg 44140 is 14 line(s) on 11/11/90 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to JERRY OLSEN re: R/NOLOCAL FOR DOS 2.X?

The function that NOLOCAL traps is 4EH, "Search First File".  NOLOCAL
exits immediately if the template does not have a file type of "???"
and does not come from high memory (the transient part of COMMAND.COM).
I think the problem is that in DOS 2.x the file type is "COM", "EXT"<
or "BAT".  I haven't check this thoroughly, or checked whether trapping
also the explicit filetypes will cause any untoward side effects.
.
P.S. I have not gotten my manual printed.  There have been delays in
an expected review from a trade journal, and I have been waiting for
that review before I started advertising.  And the response I have
gotten from attending some conferences is noconclusive.  I also
have used the "soft" state of the manual to make some revisions when
I have added some enhancements to the software.  Hard typing with your
fingers crossed!

In reading the last month's postings here, I see stuff from Tony Antonucci
(sp?) that leads me to believe that you've got either 9600 baud operation
or MNP level 5 compatibility here.  Is this so?  Randy was asking for
donations for same on chinet lately; if both my favorite hangouts are using
MNP 5 I suppoose I'd better figure it out... and buy a modem myself!

Could you tell me what CBBS is using and how to take advantage of it?
Thanks,  Marty.

Msg 44142 is 08 line(s) on 11/12/90 from TONY ANTONUCCI
to MARTY DIPPEL re: 9600 MNP 5

Marty; CBBS usea USR 9600 HST, I think the regular HST has MNP level
5. I think the hottest 9600 baud modem is the USR 9600 Dual standard,
sincthe HST standard might not become "de fa but "tons" of BBS
use it. V.32 is thcurrent "blessed" standard. As far at MNP 5, goes
etty standard now, but watch for v.42 and v.42bis in the future.
I have a lot of information on my BBS about 9600 baud modems.
give it a call if ya like 991-3830, its up most of the time, some
public domain software there too.

JerrY;
  thanks for your help!  I've been making some progress here, but

  Do you know of any EGA or Herc. screen capture programs??  What
I need to do is scan an image into a TIFF file and then capture it
into a BLOADable graphics file (yes, I'm using BASIC, but not by choice!

M-Soft Prof. Dev. System will let you do.)  If you have any ideas,

Msg 44153 is 18 line(s) on 11/15/90 from JAMES SCHMIDT
to ALL re: CELLULAR PHONE QUESTION

I have a question on the inner working of the Cellular Phone System:

When an incomming (from the wireline to the Cellphone) call comes in,
how does the system know what cell to transmit on?
Does it constantly keep track of all powered on Cellphones ?
Does it broadcast the general poll on all cells ?

I've come to the conclusion that initially the system doesn't know where
I'm at until the phone responds to the ring and then perhaps it switches
to that appropriate cell. Is this correct ?

It seems if a call comes in and the unit is turned off the system takes
about 15/30 seconds to inform the calles the subscriber is out of the
service area or left the vehicle. If the Cellphone is actually turned on
in standby mode the system seems to ring forever.

Any background infromation would be appreciated,
James Schmidt

There's a program in the book FRACTAL PROGRAMMING IN C that saves a

Msg 44156 is 08 line(s) on 11/16/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to JAMES SCHMIDT re: R/CELLULAR PHONE QUESTION

When someone calls you, the system sends your number out on a reserved
signalling channel common to all cells.  When it sees the number, your
phone beeps you and when you answer, it sends its number out on the
signalling channel.  A couple different cells will hear your phone
replying and they'll tell this to the central controller along with
an indication of how strong your signal was.  The central controller
decides which cell you're in, assigns you to an available channel (by
sending codes out over the signalling channel) and connects your call.
