Anyone else using Grandview? Any comments? It is a GREAT, customizable
outliner, but there are some things I just can't get the hang of - for example
it always wants to scroll sideways, and I can't seem to make 7.5" lines the
default - they always default to 8.5" in which case they scroll sideways.

 Sure you do, Ward. You sell your time to IBM!

 I'm surprised at your comments on PCO. I like it a lot. The keyboard
is completely customizable as far as I am concerned. I turned my back '
key into a Grey+ and the <Ins> into "Zoom". These are called Macros and a
and are all not editable. You just put text "behind" the keys. I
wouldn't know about colors. I use a monochrome Toshiba 1200 and could
care less about colors. I have a feeling that John Friend could help
you with the GV problems. But beware, he might just have you read the
book first!
 [In trying to type a back ' I have discovered a ProComm + feature-the
back ' will pop up a menu! Guess I should have read that book! Every
time I point a finger, I find 3 aimed at me.]

to ALL re: 387 SPEED

 O.K. Don't know and ahven't read up on 387 processors and
need to know if programs written for the math co-processor which
will run under a 287 will run under the 387. I DO need some
speed for a new program ad finally have decided that the
chip might be worth the price to me NOW.
 Am running a 80286-8 and will be using (maybe) a 80387-20.

The Toshiba T1000 has a 720k 3.5" f;oppy. Give me a call
at (708) 356-6817.
