]__Yes, Alex you're right (re: your comments in L9003 about
being too quick to twit Michael Colon-Auger).
__After all, we DID have a guy at Inland named Richard
Head (I'da killed my parents for THAT ignominy!  And...
he even passed it (the name "Richard") on to HIS kid!)).
__And...I guess there IS a some guy named Wang who makes
computers.  Folk can get victimised badly when the "name
game" enters into it.  Bryant Ho comes to my mind, CBBS
DIDN'T want to eat a 2-character surname.
__As always, you counseled patience helps out. Sigh.
__Still...Colon-Auger?  Jeez. Guy oughta change it to
SMITH if the C-A is genuine...otherwise he risks being
made the butt (devil made me do it!) of too many jokes.

Msg 43337 is 30 line(s) on 03/11/90 from DENNIS TOKOPH
to ALL re: EIES GOES BETA

Late last year, I put up a note here about the EIES of the Chicago Public
Schools - at that time in the Alpha stage. Well, EIES is definitely in the
BETA stage now, and All computers enthusiasts are invited to take part in this
No-Cost public BBS system. Although real names are prefered, handles are
accepted (in good taste). Over 320 Megs of online storage, 100 message
areas, with more to come. Soon to provide free access to Erac, online
electronic encyclopedias, Grolier's Academic America, and access to special
areas of the CPS mainframe, for teacher's lesson plans, help with homework,
and other educational resources.

The EIES (eyes) of the Chgo Pub Schls is a Tree-structured system, similar to
CompuServe and other Electronic Information Exchange Systems. Users of those
services will find EIES' Magpie software to be very powerful. Search files
and messages for topics or any string, to limit the volume of reading you
have to do to find what you're interested in. On line conferencing and a
special "YELL" feature allow users to communicate in real time with others.
View the contents of Archive files before you decide to Download part or all
of the file. Follow message "threads" - a post and all replies - before moving
on to the next topic.

Now the number for EIES is (312) 890-8512 * 7 days/wk * 24 hrs * 3 lines.
If you want to see Chicago lead the way in the new Information Age, then call
EIES today. If the user base increases, the Board of Education will supply
more RAM, hard drives and phone lines. In fact, if demand is great enough,
there's the possibility of an (800) number by summertime. But if there isn't
a substantial increase soon, it will just be forgotten about, and your tax
dollars will have been wasted.

Please show your support - call (312) 890-8512 NOW! Tell them Dennis sent
you. Thanks for your help. Dennis Tokoph
