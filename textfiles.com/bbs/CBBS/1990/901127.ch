Msg 44205 is 23 line(s) on 11/27/90 from TOM TEPPER
to ALL re: RUSSIAN OPPORTUNITY

In August this year I was lucky enough to vacation in Russia.  In
Moscow I traveled down and down towards the middle of the earth on
an escalator to the subway that was built to also function as a bomb
shelter. In Leningrad I was awe struck by the golden splendor of St
Isac's Cathedral. At the Black Sea resort town of Socci (pronounced
so-chee) I learned the most about Russia because of the candid
disclosures by a young university graduate, Rubin. He speaks English
so fluently he is able to communicate his wonderful sense of humor. I
learned the average income in Russia varies between 300 and 600
Rubles per month.  This is about $20 to $40 US dollars.  In some ways
this is very little money. In other ways it is not so little because
the cost of housing, food, and education are ....  But you can learn
the details of this, about medical care, about the schools, about how
the socialist economic system really works in practice, and many
other areas of the Russian way of life.  While you are learning
about Russia, Rubin wants to learn how American's live.  He will be
living in the homes of my family, then he wants to learn about how
other American's live.  If you have room in your home for a week or
two you'll find this a rewarding experience while extending American
hospitality.  Leave a message here or phone me at 708/433-6650.
