 As long as you're using 720K diskettes at 720K and 1.44 at 1.44, no
I don't know any reason why the 1.44 wouldn't work perfectly for
both - that's the kind of drive (1.44) that I use at home and at work,
and most of my use IS with 720K diskettes.

Msg 43175 is 11 line(s) on 02/08/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JIM DURKIN re: R/XMODEM FILE TRANSFERS

 XMODEM is an 8-bit protocol. There's no way it would work with a
system set for 7-e-1.
 Also, xmodem was designed for micro-to-micro, so if you have a rate-
adapting step, you'll need to run a "relaxed" xmodem protocol, in which
the inter-char timeout is extended - and possibly the inter-block timeout.
 For example, if you sent at 9600 but stepped down to 2400, the 9600
would be done sending soon enough that it might wonder what happened to
the other end.
 Come to think of it, the longer inter-char timeouts probably are NOT
necessary, as long as there's no packet net involved that could chop up
an xmodem block.

 Sorry, I only tried MODEM 7 batch two times, and it failed both times.
It was a bad implementation (it echoed every char of the filename) and
has been totally replaced by Chuck Forsberg's YMODEM Batch which uses
a block 0 to send a filename as a separate block.

Unfortunately, I have been using double-sided diskettes. I already made
that mistake and learned the difference previously. I do have an 851 drive
that I have used occasionally in double sided mode. DS diskettes that I
have created on the 851 cannot be read on the Mitsubishi drive. I forgot to
mention that I had tried both reading DS diskettes with information on them
and formatting new diskettes DS. But thanks for the suggestion. That's
exactly the kind of thing that usually proves to be the solution to this
kind of problem.

to BILL WOLF AND WARD re: 3.5 IN DRIVE FLEXIBILITY

Gentlemen, thanks for the info. It looks like a drive capable of
1.44M is versatile provided proper disks are used. but that there
is the possibility that a 720k disk written on a 1.44M drive
might not get read on a drive designed for 720k only. Is that
right? Are many 3.5 in. drives designed for 720k only?
Any idea which brands or models?

Msg 43180 is 06 line(s) on 02/09/90 from BILL WOLFF
to JERRY HASLETT re: R/3.5 IN DRIVE FLEXIBILITY

Yes, I believe that to be so. I know it is true for the 5.25" disk
drives. And I am guessing the same is true with the 3.5" disks.

Yes there are many 720K only drives. Mostly on XT's. 1.44K is more
likely found on AT's. I am not sure, but I don't think I have ever
seen a QD drive on any PC/XT computer. Maybe it can't be done.

Did you ever wanted dBase III Plus just to play around with. But didn't
want to spend $ for it. Well guess what I ran into at the University
of Chicago, at the book store there? There was a book called dBase III
Plus Procedures Manual by Dennis P. Curtin, and guess what is found
inside?

You guessed it, a real working copy of dBase III Plus for the total
cost of $24.00. But before you jump in your car and get it, let me tell
you two things. They only have one left and the dBase copy has been
modified to hold only 31 records max! But everything else is there
including ASSIST and HELP.

What a deal for those who want to learn dBase at home or work at very
little cost. Or a real deal for those who never has more than 31 reconds
anyway (of those, do you really need a computer).

Well I call this the MS-DOS application deal of 1990! What do you think?

Describe the rate-adapting step in more detail. It's possible that
something is getting buffered, with the result that the NAK is taking
too long to make it from one end to the other. As Ward mentioned,
set up for an 8-bit word length; checksums, block numbers and block
counts use all 8 bits, even if the data doesn't.

Msg 43184 is 12 line(s) on 02/10/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to BILL WOLFF re: R/3.5 IN. DRIVES

The problem with mixing disks arises when you take a disk that was
originally written to with a 720K drive, write on it with a 1.44M drive
and then try to read it back on a 720K drive. The original 720K drive
writes a wide track. The 1.44M drive writes on a narrow track. When
the disk goes back to the 720K drive, the wide read head is picking
up both the narrow track written by the 1.44M drive and half of what
was originally written. This confuses the controller. The same thing
applies to 360K disks written on by a 1.2M drive.
The 1581 can read both types of disks because it has a narrow head
(as it would have to in order to be able to write 1.44M disks). The
problem never arises because it (like any 1.44M drive) isn't reading
a full low-density track.

Msg 43185 is 04 line(s) on 02/10/90 from BILL WOLFF
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/3.5 IN. DRIVES

I agree with everything you say, except that the C1581 can't read QD
(1.44K) disks, so I may assume it reads and writes a wide track. If
so, why does it still read wide and narrow tracks correctly? Does it
have something to do with the ability that C= drives are programmable?

Msg 43189 is 28 line(s) on 02/10/90 from JAMES SCHMIDT
to ALL re: LIST.COM EDITOR CAPABILITY

One of the new but undocumented features of Vernon Buerg's LIST program
is its ability to invoke you favorite editor in a point and shoot
manner. Assuming you have version 7.3d which is the current version as I
write this you can customize LIST for your editor as follows:
;
Using DEBUG and assuming you editor is named MYEDIT.EXE and is in your
PATH. Make the directory that contains LIST.COM the current directory.
Then:
 debug
 n list.com
 l
 e 17f7 "myedit"
 w
 q
It is important that if your editor name is less than 4 characters long
you pad the name with spaces to a minumum length of 4. This is because
you are actually overwriting the default editor name of "edit". I guess
an alternative would be to rename your favorite editor to EDIT.EXE or
EDIT.COM as appropriate.
;
Now when you are in LIST you can invoke a directory list via the ALT-V
command. Just select the file you want to edit and move the cursor block
the the filename and press 'e'. You will instantly invoke the editor
you selected. Note: the 'e' is not listed as one the selections on the
ALT-V screen and that's why I call this feature undocumented.
;
Once you've tried this I am confident you will use it often.

I think you are describing a problem that is unique to 1.2Mb 5 1/4"
drives.
The 1.44Mb drives write a track that is the same width as a 720K only
at a higher density and double the sectors per track an then only
when actually writing at 1.44Mb.
If you write a 720K diskette with a 1.44Mb drive it should be totally
compatable with a a 720K drive.
I do it all the time.
Format and write @ 720K with a 720K drive, write with a 1.44Mb capable
drive and read again with a 720K drive. Never a problem. You can't
do that with a 1.2Mb drive and a 360K diskette for the reasons you
stated in your original message.

   I don't understand "why use a drive at half its capacity?".  You must
hvae mis-understood something I said, for I can't imagine what that
question means.  1.44M diskettes are significantly more expensive than
720K, and aren't compatible with 720K laptops or smaller machines, so
there's LOTS of reason to use 720K diskettes in a 1.44M drive.  I
use 1.44M diskettes when doing backups or other things that are
time expensive.

  1.44M drives write 720K diskettes with flawless reliability.
  I have a 720K drive on my laptop and on my PC, and 1.44 in my AST
Premium 286.  Egghead sells 1.44M diskettes for about $40/box, but
I've heard of some <$1 high density diskettes - wonder how good they
are?  MEI seems to have gotten a reputation for adequately good
disks - meaning "occasional failures in formatting, but they replace
defective diskettes quite quickly.  I believe their # is 1-800-MEI-DIST
but I could be forgetting - I remember seeing SOME disk place whose
number was 1-800-xxx-disT because I was surprised it wasn't "DISK".

1.2M/360K problem. Thanks for straighting this out for us! I know I
found early on, that some of my 360K disk written by a 1.2M drive
sometimes made my disks unreadable on the 360K drive. Gosh, I hated
that. I had to buy another 360K drive and install it next to my 1.2M
drive. What a pain in the neck that was, just to be compatible. <BW>

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: ANSI EDITOR!

I know I am asking a lot, but what's the chances getting a ANSI editor
on-line here? I sure would help writing messages on-line here. At least
when I call with a MS-DOS computer. When I use a CP/M computer I would
still be stuck, like right now!

That should be a nice challenge for a CP/M programmer! Make a ANSI driver
for CP/M. Odds are the graphics would have to use regular ASCII characters,
but at least the editing would be nice.

Whoops! I just remembered, cursoring around on CP/M has about 6 different
terminal configurations if not more. Almost have to write a small patch
for each computer huh? Plus some can't do it because the terminal type
won't let them period! <BW>

P.S. I tried!

to ALL HST 9600 re: CBBS OK @ 9600 AGAIN

I am entering this msg from an HST modem at 9600 baud.  Something
is screwed up in my commo program but this time (blush) I'm
running from a 7-line BASIC program, and it is working just fine,
IF I first power off the modem to reset to factory.  I'll
have to see what my "string" of initialization is that is
hosing it up.
  Greg Wallace called in 2 days ago @ 9600 but I'd not noticed
his call so I thought it was the CBBS modem.

to EDDIG COLVIN re: CALLING YOU

  No, no, you don't catch on.  I'm not going to CALL you.  This
system is for communicating!  Leave a msg!  THIS system is NOT
a download system.  If you want download systems, I suggest
leaving a msg for ALL and be sure to state what KIND of system
you're looking for (i.e. what kind of computer, etc).
  Sorry you had trouble figuring things out - the software in CBBS
IS rather "ancient", but only a few have trouble.  "Hang in there".
