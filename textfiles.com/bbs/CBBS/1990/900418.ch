]__Well, dad seems to be coming and going about the mental aspects -
kind of interesting in a way.  One day he's crying about all the kids
killed in car accidents "they just go too fast".  What triggered it?
TV?  (no, without paying you only get weather and nashville stations ;-)
someone coming in from an accident?  No.  Just his mind.  A few days
later it was this Chippewa papoos with the new baby that meant peace
in the land.  Hmmm.
__Fortunately other times he's 90%.  We try to get things done during
those times.  He gets released to a "home" Tuesday, for therapy.  If
his leg heals he can come home, if his mind doesn't, he's there to
stay.  At least it is a place he visited regularly, knows people, is
close by, etc.

up with the following response:
A lisa with the Mac program, macworks I think, is equivalent
to an unenhanced 512k mac. 64k roms, 400 k disk, etc.

to WARD CHRISTENSON re: SUPPORT FOR CP/M+

I'm a first-time caller; I got your phone number from "How to Get Free Sof-
ware" by Alfred Glossbrenner. My question:
Does this BBS still support CP/M, and CP/M+ (commodore 128)?
I have recently been given an Altos mini computer, with the MP/M operating
system. I have concluded that MP/M II is very close to being the same as
CP/M, so I am looking for CP/M software and support for both the Altos and
my Commodore 128's CP/M+ v3.0.
Thanks in advance for any info you can provide. I will list your number and
the purpose of your system on all local systems that will allow such ads, if
you wish. -John Bargar.

Although a lot of people here are still familiar with CP/M, it hasn't been
a major subject of discussion here for a while (note that this is a
message-only system; there's no file section). Two systems where CP/M
discussions frequently take place (and where there are CP/M fils)
are the Advocate/NOWAR at 312-939-4411 (South loop) and the Antelope
Freeway at 312-764-5162 (Rogers Park).

to KEVIN MCGUIGAN re: R/WARD WESTERN UNION

If you use a modem that stores its configuration in non-volatile memory, you
should be able to "hard-wire" a value of 1 (or whatever) for S0, which
should cause the modem to auto-answer all the time. Our local cable TV
office used to have a printer hooked up to a modem for receiving JULIE
reports (reports of people planning excavations that would require the
company to mark off any underground cables).
Most of the cheaper external 2400 modems use non-volatile memory now.

it was disconnected. So I am leaving this message here. The mother
board is an old type PC 2, then 256k version. It os an original
IBM board. It worked greated last time I ran it. You can have it for
$50.00 or $50.00 worth of IBM stuff that might interest me.
Call me at 708-358-5065.
