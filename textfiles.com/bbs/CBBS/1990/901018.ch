]Ward:
Thanx for the suggestion RE Magee Ent.; yhey were written up recently
in a local PC publication.  I ended up taking a position as head PC
programmer for a non-profit service bureau and am now up to my elbows
in BASIC (yes, BASIC!!) code.  Went to a meeting of the Atlanta UNIX
users group recently, and met a guy who works at Emory U.; a UNIX
head, but also a big booster of QuickBASIC!  Amend the old saw to
read "DP makes strange bedfellows".  At this point I'm doing BASIC
on PCs, C in UNIX (at home), and am getting into VM on IBM m/f!!
What next??  Maybe I'll get a copy of Coherent; there seems to
be some interest in it here!
I miss being able to dial up anytime, what with long distance
charges being what they are, but I haven't found anything quite like
the "WardBoard" here yet (even if I do, I'll keep buggin' you!)
Warm regards, and many thanks!
Colin

  I think Microsoft is your best bet - if you've lost yours, perhaps you
can send the original diskette or something to get them to send you a
manual.

Did IBM put out any PC/AT's with low density floppies in them.  I will
check for the * on the underside of the drive.  Also, the drive is the grey
putty color... Did IBM not code low density drives as black???
I will let you know what I find.  Thanks for the info.

to ALL re: IBM/SYSTEM36 Q

I am looking to transfer ( upload/download) files with an IBM
System36.  At this moment the 36 does not have a modem or software.
Can anyone tell me what might be available in the way of software
and the needed hardware to allow file transfers?

Harry, you should also know that the manual is 632 printed pages,
and as such is probably not suitable for downloading. Regards...

-Floppy Woes
I just got a 2nd hand XT compatible (Commodore) computer. I installed a 720
K 3.5" drive. Try the following:
Assume you want to install the HD floppy as drive b:
Make sure that your DOS diskett has the DRIVER.SYS file on it.
Edit your CONFIG.SYS file, or create a CONFIG.SYS file on the DOS diskette.
For DOS version 3.2 or lower, put the following line as line 1 in CONFIG.SYS
DEVICE=DRIVPARM=/D:1/F:1
Here the D option refers to drive=1 (i.e. b drive)
The F option being 1 refers to high density (1.2 Meg).
For some later DOS 3.2, and definitely DOS 3.21 and above, install the
following device driver in CONFIG.SYS and make it line 1:
DEVICE=DRIVER.SYS/D:1/F:1
Now when you boot from the floppy, the high density driver will be installed
Oh yes! to FORMAT for high density for DOS 3.3 and above use FORMAT C: (I
am assuming that you don't have a hard drive. For DOS 3.2 or lower FORMAT
B: will do. I hope this works for you without modifying the mother board.
In my case I had to do a little rewiring. But that is another story. My
system does work now, and if I want to I can boot from my NEC 720K drive.

hello everyone and how are you doing

Msg 44055 is 04 line(s) on 10/18/90 from MICHAEL SHARTIAG
to NAZIR PASHTOON re: R/PC/AT FLOPPY PROBLEMS

I do have a hard disk, with 1 floppy.  My machine is an AT.. the problem
is that the computer is not recognizing the 5 1/4 as a high denisty.
  You raised one point though that could apply?  At what level of DOS
was High denisty standard for 5/14 in drives, or at what machine type?

Msg 44056 is 13 line(s) on 10/18/90 from JOHN SERRANO
to ALL re: IDE DRIVE FOR PS/2 M. 30-286

I would like to know if there are any aftermarket hard drives that
work with the PS/2 Model 30-286's IDE socket.  All I know is that the
IBM drives' power source is also on the IDE, whereas some makers have
separate wiring for the power supply (like Western Digital's IDE drives).
I'm running a Seagate model 151 3.5 HH drive.  It's okay for now, but
I only have about 7 megs free, thanks to Windows 3.0d 2 other Win3
applications.  I think Conner has a 209 meg drive that would fit nicely
in the bay my Seagate occupies.

Also, I'm looking for  a black and white *.PCX file of the Seal of The
Department of Defense.  The laser printers I'm using at work jam up when
we use papers with letterheads.  What I do is import the file into Ami
Professional, and the rest is self-explanatory.
