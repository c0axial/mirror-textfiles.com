to MARK WOZNIAK re: R/MAC+ AND MIDI

 949-6434 is the local midi bbs. I'm into PC, and the BBS might be,
or it might be all MAC for all I know. Give it a try.
 P.S. I believe it is in (708) as I 'processed' my phone directory,
and it didn't get a (312) stuck in front of it.

Msg 43032 is 16 line(s) on 01/14/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to ALL re: WP SUGGESTIONS?

I'm exploring word processor choices for a client who has some very
specific, limited needs. My own preferences and needs are rather more
complex, and I haven't really followed "lesser" programs for some time.
I'd appreciate input.
 After some fairly concrete consultation, their needs (in a medical
office) can be placed into two very limited areas: 1) basic correspondence
and 2) "mail merge" documents. It's also clear that if the WP program
which they get DOES have advanced features, they should NOT get in the way
of basic text entry. (Advanced formatting capabilities, etc., can be
there-but shouldn't slow down basic entry.) Secondly, ease of learning
is far more crucial than for most offices.
 The mail-merge language can be complex. They don't want to have
responsibility for setting up a relatively finite number of form
documents. (I'll do that.) But USE of such templates must be as easy and
bullet-proof as possible.
 Any suggestions?

Msg 43033 is 02 line(s) on 01/14/90 from CHARLIE KESTNER
to JERRY OLSEN re: R/WP SUGGESTIONS?

You KNOW which program fills THIS bill!
Dare I say it? It begins with a 'w'.

Msg 43034 is 04 line(s) on 01/15/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to CHARLIE KESTNER re: R/WP SUGGESTIONS?

Well, I guess beginning with a "w" rules out Multimate and Displaywrite
(though I think beginning with any letter between "a" and "z" would also
rule those two out), as well as Sprint. It does, however, leave a
choice between "whippy" and "wussy" :-)
