Msg 44193 is 07 line(s) on 11/24/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JAMES SCHMIDT re: SOFTWARE BARGAIN

  If posting a msg like that, Please identify the circumstances under which
the software has been made available.  Most companies, when transferring
licenses, require the originator to send a letter to the company stating that
they are no longer using the software, have not upgraded it, etc, and that
the software is transferred to such and such a person, etc.
  Also please conserve space - a single line with no indents will tell just
as good a msg as your 20-space indented, 4-line per product, msgs.  Thanks!

I just got an IBM PC Convertable, the first model with now backlit screen
256k of RAM, and 2-720k floppies.  I was wondering if anyone knows how
I can get upgrade parts for this thing.
.
Thanks,   Dave

Tom Etheridge sysop of The Cook County BBS reported that his system
has suffered a major hardware failure.  His system will be down for
quite a long time.  Two months at minimum, possibly more.  This is
based on information reported to the sysops of Fido Net 115 by
Jerry Callahan.
