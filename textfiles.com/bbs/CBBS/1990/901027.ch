]Does anyone know which of the Turbo C books out there will be a good
text to learn the language? I just got a copy of the software, and
am looking to stop using GW-Basic so I can compile my code. Thanks!

to WARD re: YOU -> ERIC BOHLMAN

I live/work in the South Loop and occasionally cross paths with Eric. If
nothing's more convenient for the two of you, you're welcome to drop off
the package here as a partial solution to his problem. To do so, simply
leave the package with my name on it at 1130 S. Michigan (noting room 1816
prominently on the package). Receiving Room is open 10-7 weekdays and
Sat. a.m. The doorman can deal with it at other times. Of course, feel
free to "buzz" me on the intercom and I'll come down to pick up directly.
If you leave it downstairs, also call / leave a msg on my answering
machine so  I'll keep an eye out for it. Alternately, you can call voice
in advance to set up a convenient time: 312.939.3300 (workdays).

to DAVID GIBBS re: R/C PROBLEM

The peekb() approach that was mentioned would be ideal, but...the last
version of QC I saw didn't have it, nor did it have Turbo C's lovely
MK_FP (make file pointer) :-( .... Your use of FP_SEG and FP_OFF will
work, however. As I recall, though, QC *requires* that the address
values be cast as a CHAR far pointer. Anything else will result in an
error msg...as you discovered. Diddle with it awhile. It DOES do the
job. I've seen it in a few source-code files I've moved into TC. Good
luck.
No dup. chars.
