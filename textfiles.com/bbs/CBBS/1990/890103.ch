Bullitin?  Yeh, but at least he's a little creative.  All the others
write "bulliten."

This is the only machine (of those in Randy's home) that gives me
so much line noise.
Did you read the "Pridigy" response.  What language is it in?  Chicago?

Msg 42985 is 10 line(s) on 01/01/90 from STAN BEGGS
to ALL re: SECOND HARD DRIVE

I have a new second hard drive I got as a gift from my wife. I purc
the cableparatly and attempted to install seagate st225 20
meg exactly \. I get an error of "boot disk error" or
"unable to load system software" when I turn the power on a cabling
the two to the controller. My controller is a WD1002-WX2a, I have lost
the doc for it. It has jumper pins that I think need be set, but I am
afraid to change for fear of damaging something. My drive doc says to
set the drive swithes to ds2, doing this causes everything to fail{
the current drive will work if set to ds1. I am really confused.
I hope someone can help me. Thanks, Stan

to JOSEPH SKOM re: R/POWER STRIPS

Haven't seen ANY huge power strips. The best thing is to figure out
how to lay out the transformers and go to a local hardware store,
get some electrical boxes etc and make LARGE plug in connectors. Then
whatever you have to do to use the Power Strip. I use a 4x4 box
for my modem AND have a "switch" on the box to turn it on/off.
Beats bending over for me.

Msg 42987 is 05 line(s) on 01/01/90 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to STAN BEGGS re: R/SECOND HARD DRIVE

Everytime (!) I install a drive I mess up. The most likely cause for
a FIRST guess is the cable connector. Following directions for
hooking TWO drives up with a "straight" or "twisted" cable is the
FIRST step. Describing THAT situation can help a person understand
your problem.

Msg 42988 is 02 line(s) on 01/01/90 from CHARLIE KESTNER
to JOSEPH SKOM re: R/POWER STRIPS

 Why not simply plug those nasty transformer-plugs into a very
short extension cord, and plug THAT into the power strip?

I work with a number of companies that provide perfect binding. If you
have a specific project in mind (i.e., know number of pages, etc.), give
me a call and I'll work up a quote for you. Generally, I come in under
most retail sources as I qualify for wholesale. Voice number is: (312)
939.3300 (workdays, afternoons till 6 p.m. best).

The TIPS files sound quite interesting. Any chance you could U/L over on
The Advocate.or submit a disk, if more convenient? I'd be personally
interested, and I think others over our way would be too.

Msg 42993 is 16 line(s) on 01/03/90 from JIM POLOUS
to ALL re: NEW YEARS' VIRUS?

Is there anyone out there that had any experience with a New Years Virus?
I had my computer turned on on 01/01 in the evening and left it in Word
Perfect until 5:30 the next morning (01/02). I saved the current document
on to a diskette just before turning it off. When I came home from work
that day, I booted the computer only to find, "Bad or missif*ng command
interpreter". After booting from a write-protected master DOS disk, I
discovered that some directories had been removed, others were there,
but the contents was something else. For example, newly downloaded
items that were in my C:\new\ directory were now in C:\UTILS\ All files
in the root directory were gone. Strangely enough, my D: drive was not
affectf*ed. I'm wondering if anything on D was infected, as there are
files there that are not easy to replace (executables). Of course I don't
keep a backup. I have yet to find an easy way to backup 97 megs on
diskettes without losing my mind . And I have had a tape backup in mind
for the last couple of months.I guess this reaffirms that purchase with
my next paycheck.
