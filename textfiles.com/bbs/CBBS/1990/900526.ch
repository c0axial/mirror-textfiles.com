to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: MORE MEMORY

 This morning I read an article in Software Magazine on DOS extenders.
It's in the May 1990 issue and is called "DOS: Still thriving after all
these years". It is more of a management overview, with absolutely no
how-to, but it did say that the DOS extenders like PharLap require
reprogramming, presumably source code changes.

to ALL re: PARADOX BOOK ???

Looking for a book to help teach using Paradox & PAL language.
This would get the person beyond the simple stuff.
It didn't seem like the Paradox manuals covered things in a nice slow
simple manner on how to perform math, write "programs" etc.

to ALL re: SPSS STAT PACKAGE??

Any users of a statistical package called SPSS ???

We currently use Lotus, Paradox, a few graphics packages.
Want to be able to crunch numbers for marketing folks and then present the
marketing info back to them.
