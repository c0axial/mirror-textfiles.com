to ALL re: ALL'S CHARGE CARD?

I have a 286 machine in which I would like to use a device called
the "All's Charge Card." It is a device manufactured by a Canadian
company wally improves the ability of a 28 handle
memory. It makes it more like a 386 in that aspect. Has anyone out
there used {he charge card? Does it work with VLSI technology?
thanks Richard Hinton.

to ALL re: CHECKFREE EXPERIENCES

Does anyone currently use CheckFree to pay their bills?
Is it all its cracked up to be?
Is the local access number really TOLLFREE ?
Have you ever had any problems with missing payments or misdirected payments?
Is it worth the $9.00 per month for up to 20 payments?
I noticed a nice comment by PC Magazine about CheckFree in their last
issue and it has me interested.
I am looking for actual real life experiences.
{Thank you,
James Schmidt

Wow that is too bad! I am not sure if this is the same thing, but I
know a BBS in Milwaukee that acts like some overlays are missing. You can't
save any messages anymore, but saves the header of each. It happened about
the same time as yours did! My MS-DOS is doing fine, although I don't think
I had it on New Years's day. I do run virus checks about three times a year.
Not that it will always help.

Yes, I hate to backup my files too. And sometimes I do and sometimes I don't
do so. But I have lost files from time to time. So I should have learned!

I don't have tape drives (except back in the early days), so I can't help
you there. I hope you find out what kind of virus got you and what software
it came in on! It's a shame things like this happen. Makes me want to go
back to ROM operating systems! <BW>
