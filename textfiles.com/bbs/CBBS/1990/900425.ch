Msg 43507 is 06 line(s) on 04/25/90 from BILL MATTSON
to GERALD PINE re: R/8-INCH DRIVE JUMPER SETTINGS

Delighted if anything I mumbled was of any value.Coincidentaly, I
just started experiencing "BDOS error on C:" errors on one of my drives
(an 800 or 801.I'm not sure yet) head actuates but no read. I havn't
ripped into the old booger to see if something is loose or I need to
scavenge a new drive. I hope its the drive as the computer is one of
those "superboards" and they're nasty to work on. Oh well.Regards.

I don't recall the beginning of the thread, but if it turns out you need an
8" drive, I MAY have a couple for sale (cheap) shortly. If so, I'll be
putting a msg up over on The Advocate. Should know one way or the other
the end of this week or next week, whenever time permits.
