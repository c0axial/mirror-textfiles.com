The bbs with lists is basically a cp/m system. On logical drive A3: are
lists of Chicago areabbs. (noise again) But I
havn't found the way to get subsets of the list. Good luck. more noise

to ALL re: HD NOISE

 Just put a ST251-1 in my 386. It sure is noisy! The startup clicks
are enough to drive a person bananas at night. Is this a normal
thing for the 251-1?Have to put another in the XT tomorrow and
will see if THAT one is the same.

to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/HD NOISE

Noisy drives have a tendency toward failing. The sounds that yours makes is
far too execessive. Better make regular backups.

Msg 43312 is 04 line(s) on 03/04/90 from BILL PRECHT
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: 251-1 NOISE

I bought a Seagate 251-1 about 18 months ago, and I have had no
complaints, EXCEPT when I power up or down. At either time, I
get a string of several seconds of ratcheting clicks. I never hear
the clicks at any other time. Seems like it's part of the design specs.

Is there a file section for Up and downloading here?
also, where abouts is this board located, so I know how much calling here
will cost. Thanks Bri
