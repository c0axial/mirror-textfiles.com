to BENJAMIN COHEN re: R/REVIEWS

 Dunno if I said this, but when I did my article on Periscope debugger
for PC Tech Journal, I received a follow-up comment that I couldn't receive
any compensation in any form from the company whose products were being
reviewed - specifically stating that I couldn't be "given" the equipment
to keep. So when I mentioned this to them, they said "OK, we'll charge
you $1". I said that wasn't the intent of the policy, and I wound up
paying something like dealer cost for it.

I'm real sorry to hear this but there is nothing I can help you with.
But if I can, just let me know. By the way, did you read my advertisement
about the EGA monitor and Paradise card?

to ALL re: 3270 EMULATION SCREEN DUMP

hello:

i need help in either finding or writing a utility that will allow
screen dumps of 3270 emulator board images to a file. i have seen
"snapshot.com
by pc mag but that only seems to work off of the "natural" session
(i.e., pc-loaded application). i need something to capture
cicsvs screens to send on email.

any help would be *greatly* appreciated.

thanks,

 Well, I just finished that darm revision to my Palmistry program.
It is about 700K and should probably be up on the Hare Krishna BBS
in a day or two. For EGA and a fast computer. This is the S/W]
version. Definately different and 300% better than my last version,
should be for all these months learning more programming. Some
 neat graphics for QB.
