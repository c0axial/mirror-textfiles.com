]__Chinet STILL down?  S**t!  I musta dialed it 20 different
occasions during the day yesterday.  (Even called Suess to have
him kick it, in case it was stuck.  He said "No it's not down, I'm
down, trying to get a new kernel in.")
__Really bad when you can't get your chinet fix in.  (All you fault,
Alex, BTW, for ever turning me onto public access Unix!!! 8-]  )
.<--See!  GOTTA have a chinet fix really bad!

]Just think of all the mail and usenet stuff that is backlogging
and/or being sent back as undeliverable.  The great teacher of
physiology, AJAX (A.J.Carlson) was a believe in occasional fasting,
like mebbe once a week.  So enjoy the fast (^r).  If things get
too rough try Nowar/Advocate at 9394411.  You don't have to be
registered-validated to read the msgs. A different world.
Open your capture buffer and at the prompt: m;r;new.  Will give
you everything, continuous read.  Plain old fashioned bbs similar
to this one. hmmm...mebbe you could take an aspirin or two before
logging on.

]__AZ.  FAST?  ABSTAIN? Yuck!
__4-2-n8ly, our trusty sysadm has gotten it back up again, so
the pain is now over with.  (MY pain, dunno about his.)
__Aspirins if I'd call Nowar?  Well, from reading my posts on
chinet - you should know by NOW that I fit neither the "liberal"
nor the "conservative" mold.
