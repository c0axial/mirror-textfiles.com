 Thanks! I've been meaning to call the Tosh BBS. I'm sorry they
don't seem to have much on Compuserve in their forum - I'd like a TSR
that I can use to turn off the hard disk; I understand there is something
there - perhaps a program to turn it off "now" - but I'd rather have a TSR.
 Also, I want to put a couple copper (brass) shims together with an
insulator between, so I can put an ammeter in the thing - see just how
much the current draw changes based upon the following:
 - hard disk on or off
 - lcd on or off
 - backlighting at various brightnesses
 - low and high speed (4.77 and 9.54)

I am proposing to set up a CP/M bbs in the very near future and would like
to obtain copies of the IMP modem program overlays. I have access to format
conversion equipment/machines so that wouldn't be a problem. MEX is a lot of

I know that Compuserve has the files, but I don't suscribe because I am a

Msg 43604 is 23 line(s) on 05/19/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: QEMM OR ? MEM RELIEF?

 Help! My FoxBase enthusiasm has gotten me in some technical trouble!
 I became a strong FOX advocate at work, got my own license, others
got more, and finally, a big project was started based upon FOX and a
LAN.
 Trouble is, we are using the 3270 workstation program on PS/2 model
70s and 80s, (both 386, thank goodness) and with the LAN and host, we
have under 350K free! Fox apparently needs 440K free (results of
CHKDSK being the definition of free memory) to run.
 I understand they're looking at QEMM. One problem is the darn PS/2
has that unwanted ABIOS taking the entire E000 segment - useless (I think)
unless you're using OS/2. Anyone know if QEMM or 386^MAX will just
blow that out of the water (or, if it CAN be blown out) allowing more
EMS?
 I think I'll look at moving drivers into EMS, and see what else I
can do. More than "function", we need MEMORY RELIEF - i.e. the emulator
has to be small, and the number of things it can use to high memory,
large.
 I would appreciate ANY and ALL suggestions for minimizing memory
requirements, and maximizing memory availability.
 P.S. the LAN is Token Ring.
 P.P.S. will the LAN version take even MORE memory? Will compiling
cut down memory requirements? (Ooh, but then we still can't
"develop").

Msg 43610 is 08 line(s) on 05/20/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to WARD re: BB "RETRY" PROBLEM

A down-and-dirty solution would be to write a little CE handler which
simply returns if _AX & 8000h is NULL _and_ DOS indicates the error is
"device not ready." Then execute BB and do a system reset when done.
I did something quite similar in a program under development and it works
like a charm. (The _AX test simply determines that it's a disk-related
error rather than a character-device or FAT error.) If of use, I could
send a .C module your way which would be ready to use with a few changes
to code which is unique to my program.

Msg 43611 is 12 line(s) on 05/20/90 from BOB COHN
to TONY ANTONUCCI re: R/1200 HAYES MODEM

Thanks. Yes I am interested in your true blue Hayes 1200 baud modems.
I was able to get one for myself at the Chicago Computer Exchange for
$50. (used) I have other friends in my industry who also want the same
modem to run this one special program we use. With a Hayes compatible
modem you can run 99% of the program features. There is one "flaw" of
the Hayes that is used in this program. Other modems will not start
sending out data signals until they get a "handshake" from the other
modem. The Hayes 1200 starts sending tones even with no connection.
My friends are now using Hayes compatible modems and only getting 99%
of the features of the program. They would like to use all 100% of
the features if they can do so inexpensively. What would you sell your
modems for? My phone number is (312) 929-2200. Bob Cohn

Msg 43612 is 18 line(s) on 05/20/90 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/QEMM OR ? MEM RELIEF?

Ward:
 I sympathize with you! DOS's memory limits are (at least now)
ridiculous! But you should be able to take advantage of the
programs like QEMM which wouldn't even exist if DOS had been
properly upgraded to deal with 286 and 386 processors when they came out.
In my experience, many device drivers can be loaded high with QEMM.
This includes network drivers for Novell (at least on the stations,
I'm not sure about on the server), and perhaps other LANs. I'd
check with your LAN OS vendor to see if it's possible and if there
are any tricks involved. Other drivers can also be loaded high,
depending on their spec.s.
 350K seems awful low, your system must really be loaded! 230K
of resident stuff seems awful high even to me (who deals regularly
with Mac folks who LOVE to stuff RAM with gadgets!). There's GOT
to be a way around this situation. QEMM is a great product which just
keeps getting better, and Quarterdeck has other good stuff for
memory mgmt. I'd look to them for help.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/QEMM OR ? MEM RELIEF?

 Ward, I have DESQview 386, have run a few experiments on an ALR 386 with
2M RAM, and have some findings:
 1. Even though the manual says, in italics, "Do not run DESQview on a
server machine", I have done it with a 10NET non-dedicated server. The network
will operate while I am in another window, but sometimes it will hang up
and I will have to go back to that window and cause an interrupt.
 2. If I start the network from a window, I don't have access to it
from any other windows.
 3. My fax program will run in window #1 and even answer calls
while I work in window #2, although it slows down #2 noticably if
I'm in a text editor. Assuming you don't have to access the 3270 board
with your FoxBase programs, you should be OK.
 4. When I start a new "Big DOS" window, even after starting programs
in other windows, I still have 590K to work with. Subtract 40K or so
for COMMAND.COM and you still have plenty of room for FoxBase. You can
save the 40K by having DESQview load MFOXPLUS.EXE directly.
 5. FoxBASE Plus is one of the programs that DESQview will install
automatically if it finds it on your disk.
 Conclusions: DESQview/386 may or may not help you. Quarterdeck has
a multiuser BBS at 213-396-3904 and is on Compuserve at 76004,2310.

to BILL WOLFF re: DBII/III+

The dConvert program is supplied with the dBASE III/III+ package.
It is an EXE file that allows one-way conversion from II to III/III+.
It seems to work well; we have used it to convert client databases
to III+/Clipper/Fox with no problems. The TXT files you refer to:
do you mean MEMO fields or ASCII text. III+ will allow you to read
ASCII text files delimited with almost any character. However, if
you want III+ features, I would go with Fox Software's FoxBase+ or
FoxPro system, since it is much faster and has many extensions over
the standard III+ stuff. However, my experience has shown that the
.FRM files are somewhat different under Fox than III+. Our company
uses both but doesn't cross over from one to another except for data
files (index files are different too, but Fox can be set otherwise).
Sorry it took so long to get back to you. Been very busy all around.
Msg back if you need further help.

I have a lot of computer stuff for sale: 10 & 20 Mb hard drives,
controllers, memory cards, motherboards, a PC Jr. setup, floppy diskette
drives and loads of other stuff. Printers: Epson dot matrix printers
galore, extra parts, etc. I have a number of PC & XT power supplies,
printer buffers, an old S-100 system (Cromemco et al.)
Leave me a message and I'll get back to you. I'd like to clear this
stuff out (to make room for other stuff, naturally).

to ALL re: XEROX 4045 4 SALE

We have a client with a Xerox 4045 laser printer for sale. This is the
11 or 12 ppm printer, heavy duty (not UPS shippable), designed to be used
a lot. This printer has hardly been used: roughly 1000-1200 pages
have been run through it. It has the optional copier attachment to
allow it to be used as a copier. They have just run the initial
toner load through it; you'll get 3 or 4 bottles of toner with it.
This unit was specified for an application that was later reduced
in scope, and therefore a printer with this capacity just isn't needed.
List on this thing was $5400 when they bought it. I believe they would
take $2500 for it with stand and everything. Leave a message for me
here or call (708) 382-2305 and ask for Scott.

Jerry, I'm interested in VDE. But the CP/M machine is in her classroom
with no modem or term software. I'm hooked up to this BBS with all
kinds of machines but no CP/M. Do you or would anyone you
know have the software on disk (Public Domain, right?). I'd be
happy to send you blank disks and a stamped mailer. Also if anyone
knows any Primary Level software (????) for this machine.

BTW It is an Epson QX-10.

Benjamin, It is indeed a QX-10. See my previous message about my
problem with BBS's as a solution. However I'd appreciate any help you
can give me also the number of Roger Heath's BBS.
