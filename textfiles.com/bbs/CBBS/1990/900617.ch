do you accept items about the quality of service of mail-order suppliers?

to MR. WARD CHRISTENSEN re: POSTSCRIPT AT UIC

One of the UIC Computer consultants sent me a note telling me that the
bugs have been worked out of the PostScript hardware in the Xerox 4045
printers (when invoking the "2700" command). To my joy, the system now
works like a charm. What I do is that I print the PS output to a file
called "OUTPUT.PRN." From there, I rename it, keeping in mind to leave
in "PS" for a file extension. Afterwards, I upload the file to UIC and
print it later.
Also, I have another question. Is it possible to soup up the PS/2 model
30-286, which operates at 10 MHZ, to a 16 (or even 20) MHZ speed demon,
via popping in an 80C286 chipset? I have no real desire to use up an
expansion slot with an Intel InBoard 386 AT or a SOTA 386si accelerator
card.

I've heard horror stories about incompetent sales people at Elek-Tek.
They sell stuff there on an "as is" basis. Is this the standard of con-
ducting business, or what? By the bye, what do you think about Computer
Discount Warehouse (in Northbrook)? All I know is that they price their
stuff less than Elek-Tek does (as far as SIMMS modules are concerned).
