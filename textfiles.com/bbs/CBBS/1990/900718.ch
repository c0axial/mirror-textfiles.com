  Phil, Please CALL Gibson and state your concerns.  I have found them
to be pretty good at explaining things.  Also, some of their "more
cautious" stuff might have caused some perf hits and you've found 'em.
  I haven't tried mine yet (got it just like you did), but I may after
I fully back up my drive to tape at the end of the month.

to ALL re: FLOPPY STACK=HARD DISK

  I'd like to have the following:
  A program to treat a stack of normal floppies as a hard disk.
  Externally, here's how it would work:
  You'd take a bunch of floppies - ones you already have, a mix of any
format your system supports (I support 5.25" 360K, 3.5" 720K, 5.35" 800K)
and "catalog" them with this system, i.e. insert them one at a time while
the "setup" program records their contents - files, directories, etc.
  It would also assign a volume serial # if one didn't exist - fortunately
most of my old floppies were cataloged with numbers, i.e. "WARDs #0238",
and would write the serial number to the diskette.  YOU'd have to write
the serial number externally on the diskette, and keep track of it.
  Then, when all of this was done, you could DIR this new "drive".  It
would go to the HARD DISK file to get the directory!  You could even run
TREE type programs (TreeView being my favorite) ON the directory, as if
it were just another hard drive.
  When you then attempted to OPEN one of the files, the driver would tell
you to insert diskette such-and-such in drive such-and-such (I.e.:
  insert diskette WARDS #0238 in drive G:
and you'd do so; it would then allow processing of the files ON that
diskette.
  To access a diskette, you'd just CD to its "volume label": cd wards_#0.238
  Now the internals
  This COULD NOT BE A BLOCK DEVICE DRIVER because I want the floppies to
be USABLE as regular floppies (DIR, copy, etc).
  Thus the program would have to run off of INT 21, which would limit
the things you could do - not CHKDSK for example, because there's no "FAT"
on this pseudi-hard disk.
  Also, WRITING to it would be VERY difficult, because files can't span
diskettes.
  Anyone have any thoughts on this?  Want to be commissioned to write it? ;-)

Would be intrested in knowing what you want for the 60 & 80 MB hard
drives?, are they MFM or RLL and how much use have they had? You
can leave a msg hear, or call me at 708 960-8095  from 8 til 5pm.

to ALL re: DOS 4.01 & SLOW PRINTER

Again I am having problems.  I think I have used the correct steps to get
my printer working correctly with DOS 4.01 and the Gateway 2000 386.
I have entered the commands: MODE COM2:96,N,8,1,B
                             MODE LPT1:=COM2:
When I use 4DOS' list command to print a file, or V. Buerg's list.com to do
the same, or attempt a long print from Prodigy, I get a

             Out of Paper error PRN: A,R,F,I
Why is this happening?  Is there some way to tell DOS to KEEP TRYING?
Can I correct this in some other way?  Any help here will be appreciated.

                                        Thanks,
                                        Sam

have you had any contact with mighty micro, a mail-order supplier
in georgia? i ordered an intel above-board with i.o. for their advertised
price of $429. over the phone using a credit card. the item arrived in
great shape, but someone there had thoughtfully added $100. to the
bill, making a total of $529., plus shipping, not exactly a bargain!
several phone calls and over a month later got the mess straightened out.
you might fwant to order from them, but i would suggest a check, not a
credit card.

to SAMIR SHYAMANI re: R/DOS 4.01 & SLOW PRINTER

Sounds strange.  Normally a serial port doesn't have any lines reserved
for indicating things like out of paper, but I guess DOS 4 thinks you
have one.  What lines does your cable have?  The only other thing (other
than a bug in the device driver) is that the printer is sending something
other than XON/XOFF back to the computer and the driver is interpreting
it wrong.

Msg 43805 is 07 line(s) on 07/17/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JIM KENNEDY re: R/MIGHTY MICRO

  No, sorry.  I've never ordered an entire system mail order.  My most
recent "mail" order was a multi-function board from Jade, by calling
their BBS.  They phoned me back to say it was back ordered.  That was
months ago ;-)
  Did they ever explain the error?  I mean, for example, I can't type
numbers very well so I could see a simple mistake.  But if it takes too
many calls to fix, you get sheepish about it.

I have a 2 year old WYSE Model 3216 (16 Mhz 386) computer. Recenlty
I turned it off and back on to reset it (no reset button and Ctrl-Alt-Del
was disabled by the software). When I turned it back on the LCD panel on the
front read "11 RAM Bit1 Fail" Can anyone tell me what chip is bad from
this error message. I don't have a tech manual on this unit. I just added
a 2nd megabyte of memory and once I disabled it, it works ok so far. But
it is 36 static-column 256K x 9 chips and I have no way of testing them.
Any ideas?
