Msg 43514 is 08 line(s) on 04/27/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to STAN BEGGS re: R/DOS 3.3 HEADACHE

 Sorry, I'm sure DOS 3.3 is running successfully on everything from 4.77mhz
laptops to 33mhz 486s. "send stuff to the command line" is not like
"sending a file by modem" or something else for which there's an inherent
speed limit - if you can do it in a nanosecond, so much the better.
 I suspect you have something like a "slow" memory bit/byte/chip, and that
DOS 3.3 happens to be using that location, that DOS 3.2 isn't.
 You might try some "hacks" for such problems - like radically changing
BUFFERS= to cause everything in DOS to move up a few K.

Msg 43515 is 13 line(s) on 04/27/90 from BILL WOLFF
to ED FOSTER re: R/CBBS ANSWERING

Yes this happens to me too. I have had it happen with some other BBS's
too. But the same ones will reoccur with the problem and not others.
It seems to be really rare, but my guess is some modems are off freq
just enough not to catch.

Also, I have many modems here. Two are real Hayes modems. I don't recall
if the Hayes even done that? Also I don't believe my pocket modem ever
had problems either. Matter of fact, my Epson PX-8 with the built-in
modem doesn't either (oh I think it did once in Wisconsin though).

I suppose line noise can cause the same problem. I have heard many
complain about line noise only with certain BBSs and not others. So
go figure? <BW>
