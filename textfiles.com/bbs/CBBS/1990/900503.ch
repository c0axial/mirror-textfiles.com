 Yes the model number of the SHARP is the PC-4501. But you won't be able to
find them now! This was about six months ago. I ordered mine through
a place called "Connecting Point" in St. Louis. I don't remember the
phone number off hand, but it was in downtown area of St. Louis.
 If you need more info, just drop a note back! <BW>

 Bill,
 I'm selling my Toshiba T1200F so that I can buy the T1000XE which is
lighter and has a 20 MB hard disk too.

to BRENT JONES re: R/LAPTOP FOR SALE
 Hey that sounds like a great idea! I thought you were not going to
replace the laptop. So far, I have stayed away from hard disks in
laptops. Most from fear that the HD won't handle the traveling.
 But again, I haven't heard any complaints from those who have them.
