i have a apple ii+ with 64k of memory. as a gift, i recieved a game (pool of
radiance) which states it can be used with the ii+. however, it requires
128k of memory. i was informed by the person i purchased my ii+ from, that
64k was the maximum memory for my
system. does anyone know differantly?

We are using DM 4 and later. Our configurations have at least 50 MB on a
single drive, with partitioning into real small (1 MB) lower and large
upper partitions. The problems we have experienced have been on True
Blue XT and AT machines, 12 MHz AT clones, and 386 machines.

Ontrack's stuff is junk, for the most part.

The data is sent at 1200 bps according to the 202 modem standard. I'm not
sure if it's sent just once or between each ring. I'm not sure of the
data format other than that it's asynchronous.

to ALL re: MICROBYTES MAGAZINE

Do you like to hear about the newest lastest software and hardware
before they hit the magazines?

Well then "The Round Table" BBS has the lastest issue in the MicroBytes
file section. Log on today and ask for access and hopefully get access
tommorrow to get your copy. The number is (312) 777-9480. The magazine
is about 30K in size and file has not been compiled. So any computer
can download it and then view it in ASCII. Enjoy!

P.S. Tell the SYSOP that Bill sent you, thanks! <BW>
