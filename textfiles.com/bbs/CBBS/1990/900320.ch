Sorry you can't get in at 1200 baud. Here's a summary of the recent
calls (including 3 of 4 before you @ 1200 and 4 in a row after you @ 1200:
 3 @ 300
14 @ 1200
12 @ 2400
 2 @ 9600
 What can I say!

The only Apple C compiler I've heard of is Aztec C, which is distributed by
Manx. I'm not sure whether it runs in native mode or whether it only runs
under CP/M. If I remember right, it GENERATES native code.

to BILL PRECHT re: MAC RECOVER

 There are several Mac utility packages that can sometimes recover disks
depending of course on various factors. Two that get lots of attention
are SUM and 1st Aid Kit; there are others. Also, there are some services
that (for a fee of course) will recover hard disks. Yourfriend might want to
get in touch with the drive manufacturer for a start. Good luck!
