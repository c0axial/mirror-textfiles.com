to LANE LARRISON re: R/ADM.COM

 There is no such thing as "before my time". I've been in computers
since '65, (even won my Sr. High School science fair grand prize in '63
with a home-made "computer").
 But nevertheless, I never heard of ADM. What name comes up when it runs?
 i.e. does it announce itself as "American Data Machine" or something?
 Also, have you just looked at the databases themselves? it could be
a simple file format that you could darn near put thru an editor.
 Alternatively, I know a programmer who, if it isn't too big a deal,
could crank out a conversion program for you in Turbo Pascal for maybe
a few 100's of $ - depends upon what it is worth to you in terms of
saving time/money and getting accuracy. Of particular significance might
be whether it uses binary or floating point internally, or whether it
stores data in ascii, making things much easier.
 Good luck!

Looking for anyone who could sell or need a "CARBON COPY" like software
 The product is called "At-Com" and is 3000 copy selled in Europe

The following message came over in the Word Perfect echo. It may already
have rolled off the message base on COPH-2, so I'm duplicating it here.

Subj: Re: WP video problems w/ dual display
Attr:
-
 CS> setup to Hercules mono, do MODE MONO, and run WP, it apparently

I'm assuming that MODE MONO is some sort of DOS/Environment command.
Don't know anything about that, BUT you need to tell WP what video to use.
Do that with the Setup menu on Shift+F1. There's an auto-select feature
if you're not sure of your setup, but it sound like you are.

Good Luck!

to ALL re: ATARI PORTFOLIO

A classmate of mine brought the "atari portfolio" videocassette-sized PC
to class yesturday and I immediately thought about picking one up, as I
was looking for a portable PC. Has anyone had any experience with
this unit?

to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/<CONT>

Thankyou for responding to my request for ascii to bodot conversion.
Or should I spell it correctly Baudot? Thankx for that also.
I remember reading about all this back in the days of my SWTPc 6800.
There were a number of articles about building converters before
Priscella screwed Wayne out of Byte magazine. If I could locate the
first twelve issues of Byte magazine I could build a converter from their
articles. But I threw mine out years ago not realizing I would want to
refer to the "stone age" some day.

Msg 43217 is 14 line(s) on 02/14/90 from LANE LARRISON
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: ADM PROGRAM

Hey, you could have been another Woz in '63! You're right, by the
way, about a title on the ADM program. It comes up with "IBM
Application Display Management System Copyright 1984, Version 1.0"
on the screen. My hobby is programming, and I have a son in college
who's just starting Pascal, so we have enough manpower to do a con-
version program. A perfect project for a couple of hackers. The
problem, of course, is the fact that the files are all in records
format. There isn't an intelligible ASCII formation in sight any-
where. (Nothing's easy.) I've often been curious about what the
compiler does with all those neat little packets of ASCII words when
it handles them as fields (not curious enough to spend $150 for the
source code or to decipher a dump, but curious). If they're stored
as binary files, aren't ASCII values preserved? A is 65 is 1000001,
no? Thanks for your input.

wazzup ?!?!?
hay. i was just wondering if anyone out there
knows a bbs that has a lobby' feature, where several
people can be on the screen all at once and call on
(i mean carry on) conversations ?
i used to have a number for one in eaither bartlett or
elgin, but unfortunatly it went out of service.
i would most definately enjoy feedback on this topic.
