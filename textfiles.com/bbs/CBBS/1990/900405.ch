to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/16550

 Thanks! I was sad to learn that the chip doesn't automatically use
the fifo - that you have to enable it. Do you know if you can do that
"independently" i.e. so that a reset command or "something" can't un-do
it? I'm using an old YAM, no inclination to change it (I've done some
extensive patching).

Msg 43437 is 03 line(s) on 04/04/90 from DANIEL JOHNSON
to ALL re: AREA CODE 815 BBS NUMBERS

I am calling to get information on bulletin boards operated
within the 815 area code, and more specifically, in the
southwest suburban (Joliet) Chicago area. Thanks!

Msg 43438 is 18 line(s) on 04/04/90 from BILL WOLFF
to ALL re: LUNAR LANDER!

Years ago, say 1975 or so. I played a video game called Lunar Lander. It
was in B&W and played for a quarter in California. I had only known one
coin operated machine like that one.

Well 15 years has pasted. Most of that time since I have been working with
computers. But I don't recall any other program that was so much fun to
play with. I know there are Lunar Lander hacks since then. But I havn't
seen anything as fun as the first one I had seen. You were in orbit around
the moon and could speed up or down in orbit too. You could also do a 360
around the moon too. But landing on the moon had the usual zoom images as
you got closer and closer. The graphics was like OMAGA RACER (for those who
know what that is).

Now my question is. Has anybody seen the original in a computer format?
Perhaps in RT-11, UNIX, OS, MS-DOS, APPLE or even possibly in CBM operating
systems? I am not a game type person. But I do have fond memories of that
one. I don't like any of the clone versions I've seen. None of them had all
the features of the original. Any help would be appreciated greatly! <BW>
