  Is that "mounting frame" exactly what you thought?  Hope it works out.
No deposit, no return.  ;-)

to ERIC BOHLMAN re: DJ UPGRADE

$230 or something close to that to upgrade a DJ to a 500.  Gee, I called
for an upgrade package (forms) and all I got was some glossies!  (my term
for "marketing literature").  Maybe a coincidence.  I'll just wait to see.
  The original DJ's main problem is speed - solved in the + and the 500
(matter of fact, I'm not sure WHAT the + to 500 function delta is - it
IS the machine that came with the "less" smeary ink - but that's available
for older DJs too, though not in quantity now - they may be limiting it
to 500 purchasers, not sure.
  As to the diskette mounting hardware, perhaps someone could do a
wiring diagram for you if you put a note up on CBBS.  I don't have one
any more - since it is on this sytems @ Randy's place.

  Sorry, no amiga folks here.  Started out as a CP/M board with a tad of
Apple stuff, migrated, like many, to a PC oriented one.  Mostly based upon
my interests and what I own and use.

Msg 44122 is 13 line(s) on 11/06/90 from JOSE MARINHA
to SYSOP re: HARDWARE PROBLEMS

I own a PC XT clone with NEC v20 CPU. I use DOS 3.3 version
The computer have 2 drives of 3.5" 720KB and a fdd controller card
The problem is:
with a system DOS disk the computer boots up and is ok!
when i trie to format a new diskette it gives me an error
using PCTOOLS I have found that the program thinks the drive is
of 5 1/4" 360KB
Could it be a BIOS problem?
Do you think I need to get a new Bios version?
I'am calling from out side USA. So I use a diferente Keyboard
When I use the Dos command KEYB PO,860 some keys are not on the
right places. Seems to me that is also a Bios problem.
Thank's for your help

(When asking a technical question, you should address your message to
"ALL" so that everyone can see it (not a problem here, but on some
BBSs addressing a message to "sysop" means that only one person can
see it).  Also, Ward Christensen, who runs this BBS, regards messages
addressed to "sysop" the same way he regards letters addressed to
"occupant.")
You probably need to add some DRIVPARM lines to your CONFIG.SYS file
to allow FORMAT to recognize your drive type.  Check your DOS manual
for the gory details.
