to ALL re: EXT PC DRIVE HELP

 Help! I've put a 1.44M in my AST Premium, and took the old 720K 3.5"
diskette up to my PC, to hook externally.
 Well, durn, the thing doesn't work! I have an external box with power
supply, and a 1:1 (meaning "no twists in it") cable from the 37 pin
connector on the back.
 Power is connected up OK, drive addressed so it lights up (had to be
DS0), but the drive motor doesn't spin! When I substituted a 5.25" drive,
same symptoms: had to be DS0, light lit, but motor didn't spin.
 Could it be I need a terminator? Even so, that should at worst result
in disk errors, not in total failure to spin the motor!
 I'd appreciate any suggestions.
 P.S. the cable & box/power supply worked fine for an external tape not
too long ago, and BOTH drives came from working systems, (albeit they were
internal drives).

Thanks much. I'll let you know if I can find when {nd which
switch it is being tested on.

to SYSOP re: THE WORLD CONNECTION

sysop: it is kind of funny when i see that you are holding a 12th aniversary
pizza party for your bulletin board. i just came across a book called 'the
world connection' by timothy orr knight that had you listed in it as the
h/q of cbbs. keep in mind that the book was first printed in 1983.

I'd try the terminator, Ward. Sounds like what I went through with the
XT not too awful long ago.

to ALL re: XEROX 860 UPDATE

The Xerox 860 hardware problem is now solved in that the 8 inch disk
is the standard single-sided single-density. However, it is not
known how to convert an ASCII file or a WS file into a form that
the Xerox 860 software can use. Any ideas out there?

Msg 43066 is 08 line(s) on 01/22/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to JERRY HASLETT re: R/XEROX 860 UPDATE

I'm not sure what you mean by "a form that the 860 software can use." An
Ascii file is an Ascii file, period. If you're talking about converting an
ASCII file into a document format compatible with a particular word processor
that runs on the 860, let us know what that program is. If, on the other
hand you're asking how to get a file from a, say Kaypro or MS-DOS disk onto
an 860 disk, you need to find someone who does media converion. I seem to
remember that Roy Lipscomb, who sometimes calls here, can do that; I
also remember that he's out of town for about a month.
