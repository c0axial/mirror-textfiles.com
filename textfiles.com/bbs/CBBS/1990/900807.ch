to MIKE REINHART re: R/HAMFEST LIST UPDATE

 Thanks for the HamFest update! I went to my first real one last Sunday,
was VERY pleased to find some things I'd been looking for; also made some
foolish purchases (bought fuses that were 3/4" long, when I needed 1")
but no big deal. It was nice.

to ALL re: NEXT MACHINES/ PC'S & MACS

 Steve Jobs managed to change the computer world once before, so
does anybody care to speculate on his chances of doing it Again?

 Has anybody had a chance to play with the NeXT machine, and care
to speculate on whether it can steal the thunder of a 386 running
windows/3?

 The prices for the NeXT machine, a 386/pc, a MAC, or the new
Sun SPARCstation-IPC are all priced in the same ballpark. The NeXT
machine comes bundled with office automation software as well as a full
development enviornment including the Interface Builder.

Msg 43861 is 19 line(s) on 08/04/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to TOM PRODEHL re: R/ACCESSING DOS SUBDIRS

Finding subdir files of course isn't a problem. What I've been looking
for is a method to access (and-with appropriate care-potentially
modify) them. Since my last msg, I've come up with a couple of references
which have proven themselves in the past which say opening/reading/writing
of subdir files <is> possible with ordinary fxns. One source was
fairly specific, describing general use of "extended FCBs" rather than
ordinary ones, then using the "obsolete" FCB-type file fxns. I haven't
yet put more than a few minutes of time into the project and probably
won't till a couple of more pressing ones are completed.
 If anyone who has responded wants to explore all this themselves,
the best resource I've actually <seen> is Ray Duncan's "Advance MS-DOS."
My first edition discussed the issue around p. 113 or so (Chapter 6). I
understand the second edition contains a comparable discussion in Chap. 7.
Earlier, I read that a Microsoft developer's pub. described the process
in step-by-step detail, though I don't have the cite at hand. Lastly, three
callers to a BBS I run have been exchanging casual msgs on the subject,
and when one of us eventually "gets serious" about following through on
Duncan's lead, we'll undoubtedly post info there. It's an open-access

Msg 43866 is 08 line(s) on 08/06/90 from NEAL SOSNOWSKI
to ALL re: COHERENT

I purchased COHERENT, the UNIX clone, and have a problem, because my
partioning was necessarily done using SPEEDSTOR instead of FDISK.
Right now the partition information for installation will not work unless
the partitioning was done by FDISK. In about a month the company will have
a patch to manually input the partitioning information which is misread on
my system. So those of you with a similar oddball hard disk or non-standard
partition who are considering trying COHERENT should be aware that presently
there might be a problem.
