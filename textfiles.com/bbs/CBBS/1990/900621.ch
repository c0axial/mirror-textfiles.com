]Er, Mr C, that "dedicated" query really threw me.  I still can't
imagine what he really wanted to know. As fer feeling old, there
is a young gentleman on chinet who always addresses me as Mr in
mail.  He is jrd, in charge of setting up the notesfile program,
with which he worked for quite a few years on PLATO.

Msg 43706 is 02 line(s) on 06/17/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JOHN SERRANO re: DEDICATED LINE?

Do we have a dedicated line to handle calls? How could you NOT have a
dedicated line? I mean, we've had a line for ONLY CBBS since '78. ;-)

Msg 43707 is 03 line(s) on 06/17/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JIM KENNEDY re: R/MAIL-ORDER SUPPLIERS

 Sure. You mean you want to praise or complain about something? Go
ahead. The only thing NOT accepted is msgs to the generic name "Sysop"
(uugh, I hate impersonal handles! ;-)

Msg 43708 is 04 line(s) on 06/17/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JOHN SERRANO re: R/POSTSCRIPT AT UIC

 I know of no way to "soup up" a PS/2 30, sorry.
 P.S. a msg which contains "Mr." or other noise, doesn't match my
"MINE" command. It only matches the name. I've never seen a "Mr." in
a msg before. Funny. Makes me feel real old.

Msg 43709 is 07 line(s) on 06/18/90 from AL HIGGINS
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/POSTSCRIPT AT UIC

we use ps2/30's in an oem application. to speed up the ol' ibm box, we
use a sota 286 acceperator card. they were the only vendor we found
that made an acellerator card that would work in that box. fyi if you
use the sota card, they ran into some problems with their card running
in that box, they have made the approperaite changes and they're
latest card works great! if you need any additional info, i could
get the sota part number for you if you need!

Msg 43710 is 03 line(s) on 06/18/90 from BILL PRECHT
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: VISTA

Eric, please give me a call at (708) 668-1120 or 668-8557 to discuss
the Vista project. I need some info from you, and would like to
give you some, also.

Msg 43711 is 04 line(s) on 06/18/90 from JOHN SERRANO
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: THE PS/2 MODEL 30-286

I've read about 20 MHZ 286 machines. Would it take more than just a
faster chipset to really crank out some speed for a 30-286, or what?
Some computer magazines have ads of vendors who sell just the CPU chips-
that's where I had the idea of speeding up my slug.

Msg 43712 is 01 line(s) on 06/18/90 from JOHN SERRANO
to AL HIGGINS re: R/POSTSCRIPT AT UIC

Yeah, Elek-Tek has the Sota 386si for sale for $375.

Msg 43713 is 02 line(s) on 06/19/90 from PAT SKERRETT
to ALL re: INFO ON (708) BBS #'S

those numbers having to do with ham radio. if anybody has any information
to pass on to me, i would verry mutch appreciate it.

Msg 43714 is 05 line(s) on 06/19/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to JOHN SERRANO re: R/THE PS/2 MODEL 30-286

Just putting in a faster CPU chip won't have ANY effect. You have to
speed up the system clock as well. If you do this, all the other chips in
the system will have to be able to work at the faster speed. If I remember
right, IBM uses its own custom chipset, and you can bet you won't be able
to order faster chips from them.

Msg 43715 is 08 line(s) on 06/20/90 from ED FOSTER
to JOHN SERRANO re: R/COMPUTER DEALERS

No, not all dealers are like that. My experience is that the high-volume
ones tend not to give as good service as the smaller full-service ones.
Frankly, I have gotten better service from mail-order than I have from
places like Computerland and Elek-tek. Ever wonder what happened to the
people who used to be used-car salesmen? Check out the larger computer
dealers. One of those you mentioned, Computer Discount Warehouse, in my
mind makes no pretense of being a full-service dealer. Most of their
people are no smarter than Elek-tek's, but you know that going in.

Msg 43716 is 03 line(s) on 06/20/90 from CURT ROSTENBACH
to ALL re: HAMFESTS?

Anybody have a schedule of Hamfests for the Chicagoland area for this year{I
I would appreciate any information. I'm hopelessly addicted and unable
to get my flea market fix. Please help. Thank you.

Msg 43717 is 10 line(s) on 06/20/90 from ALEX ZELL
to ALL re: FEMINIST BBS

The operator of the Feminist BBS asks that the following msg be posted:
Hello. For the past five years, I have been the sysop of THE FEMINIST
BBS, which is dedicated to intelligent discussion of feminism, sexual
politics, and any other topics that users wish to discuss. Recently,
I moved and the telephone company forwarded all callers to the wrong
number. Consequently, we were essentially depopulated. I am now
recruiting new users, especially thoughtful and intelligent people
who like to share ideas. THE FEMINIST BBS is online 24 hours per day,
300/1200 baud, and located in Hyde Park. Call 312-624-8771.

 Uh, do you think the Feminist BBS operator would like it
if say, jcs, randy, me, a few others started calling?
