]Not so fast to twit, chaz.  Remember Hiawatha Bray?  Don't recall which
incident occurred where, on which BBS, but in one the administrator
disregarded Tennyson and decided he was a lady and deserved an abject
apology cuz someone had flamed him with obscenities.  In another, the
administrator (was it here?) decided it was a phony name and wanted
to zap him.  And then there is our constant old friend here: Virendra
Dhupela (did I spell it right?).  With the new immigration, especially
from the Orient, we who descend from the European continent may have
a distance to go to become as cosmopolitan in outlook as the people
our ancestors left behind.
==BTW, reminds me of a friend who is sort of a neighbor of yours.
(Well, LaPorte ain't that far from Hammond.)  A berry farmer descended
from many generations of Episcopalians converts to Judaism while in
college, later marries a nice Jewish girl, adopts two Menomonee Indian
girls and raises them in the Jewish tradition.

Msg 43320 is 24 line(s) on 03/06/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to ALL re: DEVELOPERS' CALCULATOR

Recently I've been developing a 17-function programming calculator
program for DOS. I'm now looking for a few beta testers. (Given the
lack of s manual at this stage-all help is currently limited to
context-sensitive, run-time helps screens-only reasonably
experienced software developers probably should participate.) A couple
of modest incentives: Any user whose substantive input results in
product enhancement will receive a complimentary registration when the
product is released. As tester input will heavily influence the final
product, input probably will result in an ideal tool for own needs.
 A few of the available features:
1) Values may be entered in any of several radices, with results
displayed in all of them.
2) Values also may be entered in "character" mode, resulting in
display in all radices based upon the ASCII or extended scan code for
pressed keys (user switchable).
3) Extensive arithmetic and bitwise manipulation.
4) Calculations may progressively act on results of prior operations
or begin anew.
5) Results may be based upon 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit values, with
results of prior calculations converted on the fly between these
storage classes as desired for futher manipulation.
6) All above features may be freely mixed at any time.
7) 16-level "undo" stack of prior calculations.
8) Runs as a TSR or stand-alone application.

Msg 43322 is 16 line(s) on 03/06/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to ALL re: DISK LABEL PRINTING

I work for a media arts firm in Chicago's centrally located Printers
Row which specializes in software development and graphic design. We
offer professionally designed and printed disk labels at an
exceptionally low price by ganging print for several clients in a
single run. If you market software, or are associated with a business
or organization needing its own labels, call us voice at 312-939-3300.
 Base price is $20 for the first hundred labels in any
standard color, $10 for each additional hundred. Your logo can be
added for a one-time $10 charge. Multicolor labels: Add $15 per 500
labels or fraction thereof for each additional color.
 Our next press run is in the next couple of days, but there
currently is space available for 3 additional clients. The next run is
scheduled for a couple of weeks thereafter. Our goal, subject to press
costs, is to hold the above prices for the forseeable future, but we
can only guarantee rates for the currently-schedule run.
 Other design and printing services available.
