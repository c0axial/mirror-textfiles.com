Msg 43548 is 14 line(s) on 05/09/90 from TONY ANTONUCCI
to ALL re: CMD LINE ARGS

I have a program where I would like it to operate 2 ways
1. like a filter, taking i/o redirection from DOS
2. prompting the user for input.
This would give novice and expert users both what they want.
example: (this is for a 'C' program.by the way)

 program [-options] <infile >outfile

would take i/o redirection from stdin/out from DOS.
My question: Is there anyway to find out if the user has
selected i/o redirection ?? Argc and argv do NOT seem to
reflect the infile and outfile parameters.
I probably could look in the PSP, but isn't there another way
to find this out ??

Msg 43550 is 08 line(s) on 05/09/90 from BARRY FUERST
to ALL re: IMP OVERLAYS NEEDED

Does anyone have the IMP overlay library? I am a CP/M diehard, and I
frequently get requests for a good-and-simple modem program for a
CP/M computer, and IMP is the only one I can think of that is the
least troublefree and easiest to install. MEX is a hassle and doesn't
always work. The one BBS in Chicago that had the IMP overlays is now
history, and no one else has them on line anymore.
I am going to be starting an RCPM soon, and these would be a nice
program to handle since everyone else has MEX.

to TONY ANTONUCCI re: R/CMD LINE ARGS

 Although I don't see a "real" call in my C function library for this,
you want to do an ioctl function. Depending on which compiler you're
using, you might have such a call or you might have to do it with an
int86() type call. DOS function 0x44 MIGHT do what you want, you may
have to experiment a bit to see if this really does what I believe I
remember it does.

Msg 43552 is 17 line(s) on 05/09/90 from CLIFF SHARP
to ALL re: LOST INTERRUPTS

 I have been having trouble with serial port baud rates of over 2400
ever since I upgraded to a '286 baby board. On my old 8 MHz 8088/V20
system, I had no trouble with my current serial board at 19200; the same
board (or a brand-new AT-class I/O board I borrowed) won't run any faster
than 2400 in this new machine. There's no resident software at all to
interfere (there usually is, and used to be, but for testing I took it all
out); no devices in slots that weren't in the old machine; nothing that
SHOULD be running continuous interrupts or anything. ATPERF says that my
refresh overhead is 4%, which wouldn't account for it.
 Looking at some data yesterday, my initial impression is that it goes along
quite nicely for a short period (10 to 50 characters), then drops one to
three characters (9600 baud test), then repeats that.
 Equipment is a 12 MHz '286 by Gem Computer Products of China; 200W AT
power supply; WD 1003 controller; 2 ST225 drives; 1 1.2 meg Hyundai drive;
one 1.44 meg Toshiba drive; CGA clone; and a generic XT I/O board with
everything but the two serial and one parallel ports disabled.
 Any ideas? AdTHANKSvance.

to TONY ANTONUCCI re: R/CMD LINE ARGS

What you want to do can be done by using the IOCTL interrupt as Cliff
mentioned. I have the details somewhere, but the idea is to check the
attribute bits for stdin and stdout. If they haven't been redirected,
they'll have both the "standard input" and "standard output" attributes
turned on. I just found the little function I wrote to check if a stream
has been redirected; it's written in Turbo C.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

isrd(stream)
FILE *stream;
{return(ioctl(fileno(stream),0)&3)!=3);
}

Msg 43554 is 05 line(s) on 05/09/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to CLIFF SHARP re: R/LOST INTERRUPTS

Does the problem occur only when you're displaying the characters you're
receiving? You mention that you have a CGA clone, and some terminal
programs take a long time to write to a CGA (writing only during the
retrace interval to prevent snow). If the input isn't being buffered,
you'll drop characters.

Msg 43555 is 02 line(s) on 05/09/90 from MIKE SANDMAN
to CLIFF SHARP re: R/LOST INTERRUPTS

You might try running your machine at the slower speeds (like 8 or 10 MHZ).
Good luck.Mike

Msg 43556 is 11 line(s) on 05/09/90 from ED FOSTER
to CLIFF SHARP re: R/LOST INTERRUPTS

 Cliff, this sounds like a vexing problem I once had years ago. So many
years ago that I can't remember what the machine was, although I'm pretty
sure it ran MS-DOS. The problem was that the timer interrupt took longer
than one character time to service. We found it by having a program toggle
the console speaker on and off, inserting enough NOPs to make the tone
audible, and then finding the tone was scratchy on the problem machine.
 Having found the problem, however, we had no way to fix it, since we
needed an accurate time of day. We solved the problem by using a different
machine. Incidentally, I believe only SOME of the clock interrupts were
causing problems, perhaps when the seconds bucket changed.
 By the way, 110 baud worked fine.

Msg 43557 is 14 line(s) on 05/09/90 from CLIFF SHARP
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/LOST INTERRUPTS

 Nope, the problem can't be associated with the CGA card; after all,
the CGA card was the same one I've been using for nearly 5 years withoug
problems. Thought about the snow thing myself, and have set the terminal
program(s) for no snow-checking for that reason; no difference either way.
I'm an experienced consultant myself, Eric, and hope that I've thought of
the "normal" things that might go wrong; I'm about ready to "develop" a
sort of "NOP" program and run a good monitor program on that to see what
the interrupt service routines are doing with "my" time.
 Believe me, after consulting with two of my more savvy friends, there's
NOTHING in this system that SHOULD be taking up any time; yet it seems like
there is something taking up about two ms every hundred or so, and shutting
off interrupts ("CLI") when it shouldn't be doing so. I can't think of
anything that happens in a PC at that interval at ALL.
 Thanks for the ideas. any others?

Msg 43558 is 04 line(s) on 05/09/90 from CLIFF SHARP
to ED FOSTER re: R/LOST INTERRUPTS

 Thanks for the ideas, Ed. I'm hoping that I don't have to do away with
the machine itself, since (especially) it runs like a bat out of heck. I
will, however, try some experiments along the lines of what you described,
and will let you know what comes of it.

Msg 43559 is 19 line(s) on 05/10/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to CLIFF SHARP re: R/LOST INTERRUPTS

Some random thoughts:
1) Could the 8250 chip be too slow for the bus, causing characters read
from it to get mangled?
2) I wonder if the 8250 is showing an overrun error (if not, than the
problem has nothing to do with the chip not being serviced often enough).
3) Could the 8250 itself be defective (easy enough to check if it's
socketed)?
4) If the botched communication is occurring on a modem rather than
a hardwired connection, is the handshake with the modem correct (this
might be the case if you were using an MNP modem with a locked baud
rate; the character rate might speed up and slow down according to
the compression, and it might get marginally too high when the modem
was decoding a long character run)?
5) Could the motherboard's interrupt controller be bad?

I can't think of any way to test for the overrun problem other than
to write a program that simply sits in a loop reading the data register,
checking for overrun each time. Ideally, the data register reading
should be an interrupt service routine.
