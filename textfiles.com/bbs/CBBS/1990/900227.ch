]I am surprised this BBS is still at the same phone number.  I found
it in a paper dated 05/85 and at that time the number was listed with
a 1982 date.  Anyway, I'm glad it is still here.  I left a message
addressed to sysop regarding a question on XMODEM.  Thanks for your
help.

to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/YOUR WP PROBLEM

Thanks much for the added info! I'm starting to get a clearer picure
of how all this works. Seems somewhat daunting, but still fixable.
I suppose I could get more details from a book like "Programming the
80386"- any suggestions on a specific title that you find best??

Msg 43278 is 03 line(s) on 02/25/90 from JOSEPH SKOM
to ALL re: NEED ISA BUS PC

I currently have a PS/2 Model 50 and would like to trade it for a PC with
similar specifications ('286, 1MB RAM, 20 MEG drive, VGA, 1.44 MEG
Floppy) but with an ISA bus. Please leave a message if interested.

Msg 43279 is 09 line(s) on 02/25/90 from DAVE BRAUNSCHWEIG
to SYSOP re: XMODEM

I am doing a research paper on the XMODEM protocol and I have found
differing specifications. I found this BBS number in a paper edited
by Chuck Forsberg in 05/85. My question is: when calculating the
checksum, is it the sum of bytes MOD 256 or MOD 255. I think it is
256 because of the Chuck Forsberg paper I have. However I have found
a text book that shows the checksum to be MOD 255. If you can supply
the correct answer I would appreciate it.
 Thanks,
 Dave Braunschweig

I think I am in the same boat as you are! I just use the same Lotus
commands found within Lotus! I have both Lotus and AS-EASY-AS and
find them about the same for my needs!

I guess the best reference for AS-EASY-AS is the manual the author
will send you for some money. I think he asks for forty bucks or
so for the manual and the license. Not really a bad price!

Enjoy! <BW>

Msg 43281 is 15 line(s) on 02/26/90 from JACK PINES
to ALL re: CIRCUIT DESIGN CADD AND PC-JR

Hello ALL. I'm new to the board, but I already have a couple of questions
that maybe someone out there can help me with. 1'st, I've got an XT w/ CGA
and would like to be able to do circuitry design. Design, build, and test
the circuit on the PC. I'll be upgrading to VGA in a month or two. I know
such programs are available for Atari ST's (a friend has such) and would
appreciate info for IBM. PD, SW, and commercial info all. 2'nd, a friend
has an IBM PC-jr w/ 128k (112k according to a mem program; if anyone can
explain that, please do.) He wants to upgrade but doesn't know any sources
to do so. He doesn't want to deal with IBM since he feels he already got
a raw deal from them on the jr. Any ideas? (Other than scrap the machine)
He would get another machine if that doesn't mean getting rid of the jr.
If anyone knows what can be saved from the system to go up to a PC or XT,
he would do that as well.
Thanks in advance.
Jack

to WARD re: 720K

just added one to a freinds.
has to be DOS 3.2 or higher.
just plugged the drive into the cable as the 2nd floppy - flipped the mommy
board to reflect 2 drives and config.sys was DEVICE=DRIVER.SYS /D:1 /F:2
this indicates D= 2nd physical drive counting from zero, F=720k format
the drive is then accessed as the next letter allocated - is shown at bootup -
ie. D: used for formatting, and can use either B: or D: for access.

to JACK PINES re: R/CIRCUIT DESIGN CADD AND PC-J

Hi Jack;

Well I just seen an article about that in MicroBytes On-Line Magazine(tm)
on "The Round Table" BBS. The number is 777-9480. Call before Friday, as
every Friday the magazine gets updated. Few people save the older issues,
so that's all.

The system is called "System One", this concerns the making the prototypes
of PC boards you asked about!

Enjoy! <BW>

Msg 43284 is 03 line(s) on 02/26/90 from JOSEPH SKOM
to DAVE BRAUNSCHWEIG re: R/XMODEM

I believe it's mod 256. Ward's documenation
states that you add up the bytes and "toss any carry." So you just use
the rightmost 8 bits. Therefore, you are using mod 256.

Msg 43285 is 13 line(s) on 02/26/90 from ED FOSTER
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/720K IN OLD AT?

 I might as well add my $0.02 worth to the 720K floppy discussion.
I have an elderly (vintage 1983) genuine IBM PC running genuine PC-DOS
version 3.3. It contains an original full-height floppy, a Seagate ST-238,
and a Toshiba 3.5" drive. The 3.5 is connected to the original floppy
controller.
 My CONFIG.SYS has "device=driver.sys/D:1" as its third and last line,
and DRIVER.SYS is in the root directory. I am not sure whether case and
spacing are important, but the above is exactly what I have.
 The 3.5" is accessable as B: and D:. If I FORMAT B: the result is a
360K diskette, while FORMAT D: gives a 720K diskette. Either one is
readable on other systems I have tried. If I do DIR B: on a 720K diskette
with files, I can usually see the filenames but am not able to retrieve
them.
