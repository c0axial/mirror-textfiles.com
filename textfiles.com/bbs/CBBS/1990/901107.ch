Msg 44127 is 11 line(s) on 11/07/90 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to ALL re: DISPLAY TYPE DETECTION

I'm modifying a character based application so that it will display
a bit-mapped graphic image at certain points in execution, and need
to be able to detect graphics adapter type (CGA vs. EGA vs. Hercules).
I also need to detect char only displays so as to avoid attempting
graphics on them!  Does anyone have any suggestions and/or suggested
references on this sort of thing?  It seems that I'll need to use
int 10h functions, but I don't think that will be specific enough.
I seem to recall seeing a discussion in Dr. Dobb's or PC-Mag or some
where like that, but can't find it!  Any help would be much appreciated.
