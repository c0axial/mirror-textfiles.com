 Re: IMP overlays

 I don't know what he is referring to as the "IMP" overlay. That's for
the IMP modem program, nothing to do with BBS.
 I wrote a BBS for Z80 processors called HBBS, which a lot of Sysops
like as it's likely the most automated of all BBS (whether 8-bit or
16-bit) and also one of the very easiest for anybody to use with regard
to the message base. Since CP/M puts you directly into the operating
base for BBS file transfers and since no MS_DOS BBS does (or could) do
that, lots of MS_DOS guys turn and run soon as you drop them directly
into the operating base and put them on the B0> drive where most
systems store the newest files. Etc.
 So I don't know WHAT he wants. To run a RCPM, nearly everybody uses
our BYE510 program, then usually something like ZCMD29 which adds user
areas and protection for certain private areas, shows the time
remaining and all that.
 Then they use my KMD23 for file transfers. (Think KMD22 is latest on
CP/M forum.)
 Now they need an overlay to match BYE510 to their computer and
probably need a time clock overlay as well for BYE510.
 All that stuff is on LIB 5 for CP/M forum. (BBS/RCPM systems)
 See how close that comes to what he needs. For HBBS then he needs a
computer with a time clock - to show when fellows clocked on/off, keep
them under one hour (unless he doesn't care) for file transfers, etc.
(Won't let them commence a file if there isn't enough time left to
complete it, etc.)
