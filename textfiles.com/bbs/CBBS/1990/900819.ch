to ALL re: 1200 BPS PROBLEMS

Roy Lipscomb reports problems attempting to log onto cbbs at 1200 bps. Is there
any reason for this that anyone knows of that might be caused by cbbs (or the
phone lines or gremlins pink or green)?

Msg 43882 is 05 line(s) on 08/19/90 from DAVID SUGAR
to NEAL SOSNOWSKI re: R/COHERENT

I came accross much the same problem with Coherent and strange partitioning. If
the partition does not happen to match the drive type/drive info from bios,
then Coherent will refuse to boot.
