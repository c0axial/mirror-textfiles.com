to ALL re: SCSI INFO NEEDED

 I'm considering getting an SCSI drive for my new box, and
need some basic info on this.
 The way _I_ understand this is:
 1. I need an SCSI hard drive controller
 2. I need an SCSI hard drive
 3. Do I need this SCSI "host adapter" thingie?
 A. Is this something "extra" I need to buy? I see that
 these often come bundled with various devices.
 B. Does one need just ONE "host adapter" to allow daisy-
 chaining other SCSI devices? (I.e. CD-ROM, etc.)
 Halllp!

to ALL re: IBM PS/2 TYPE CONTROLLER

We are currently using an IBM PS/2 Model 80 as a Novell file server.
However, it is going pretty bad right now. The problems that we are
having are so severe that we are considering junking it as a file server
and using it as a workstation for one of our "power" users. However, the hard
disk in the Model 80 is an IBM ESDI 314 Megabyte unit with a 50 pin cable.
Is there a controller available for this monster so that we can run it it
in an ISA bus machine?

 Is anyone on this board using 4DOS? I have tried it out and think
that it will be useful, so I ordered a copy.

 Toshiba 1200F laptop for sale. $900 Not backlit. Not HD just
twin 3.5" drives. Nice case included. For $100 more I'll sell the
internal 2400 baud modem. Brent Jones voice phone 708-665-4462

How do you get into Chi-Net? I am set up at 7-1-N. I receive the
message "Newusers logon as 'newuser' " and when I enter 'newuser' at
the logon prompt I get logged off. What am I doing wrong?

Msg 43521 is 07 line(s) on 04/30/90 from BILL WOLFF
to BRENT JONES re: R/4DOS

Yes I have used DOS4. I liked what I saw, but I haven't continued to use
it because it doesn't work with all programs. Also the reason why I
don't usually load TSR's either. I suppose if it worked with all my
software, I would jump at it.

Since I haven't used it all that much, let me know what you like best
about it. Maybe I am missing something! <BW>

Msg 43522 is 08 line(s) on 04/30/90 from BILL WOLFF
to BRENT JONES re: R/LAPTOP FOR SALE

I have a SHARP PC-4501 fully loaded. Which is about the same as your
Toshiba 1200F as far as feature go. I am wondering why your selling?
As I believe I will keep mine for years to come.

Although that maybe not surprising to some. I still have my Commodore
128, Osborne Executive, Epson PX-8 (CP/M laptop), plus many more. I
have this fear of being stuck with one computer. A bad case of it too!

to JACK HOMA re: R/CHI-NET

 You _are_ calling 283-0559, aren't you?
 If you have _any_ other telno for Chinet, it is a "contributor"
number. (Always tells you "PRIVILEGED LINE".and even though
it says "newusers log in as newuser", it kicks them off. Moral
of the story is.use 283-0559 ONLY.)
