to BILL WOLFF re: R/VGA MONITOR ON CGA

  CGA = TTL (digital) signals - basically 4 wires (excluding things like
grounds, sync, etc) - R, G, B, and an intensity lead. T Think of it as 4
bits, so you get 16 colors.
  EGA = TTL signals, basically 6 wires: R, G, B, and a separate intensity
line for R, G, and B - giving 6 bits or 64 colors.
  VGA = totally different: an analog signal, only 3 wires: R, G, and B,
but being analog, they take on any value just like your CRT brightness
control.  (in actuality, a 6-bit digital to analog converter is used within
the adapter, so each color has 64 values - a total of 18 bits, giving
a quarter million possible colors.

to BILL WOLFF re: R/VGA MONITOR ON CGA

  Oh, I forgot: as a result, VGA has to "emulate" CGA and EGA, because by
definition it is an analog monitor.
  A true VGA monitor can "sync" at only 3 resolutions that I know about:
 - 350 line (for EGA emulation)
 - 400 line for text and CGA emulation (double scan 200 line)
 - 480 line for VGA mode itself
  P.S. 400 line is also used by MCGA mode - the 320 x 200 mode that can
have 256 colors from a palette of a quarter million.

I am a current and somewhat casual user of FoxBase 2.1.  I have
several projects which require programming and I do not have the
time to devote to it.

As most of you know, Borland is offering Paradox 3.5 to current
dBase/FoxBase users for $149.  Fox is offering an update to FoxPro
for $150.  Can someone familiar with the two programs so a quick
compare and contrast for me?  I like to upgrade to one or the other
but am not sure which would be better.

Msg 44015 is 11 line(s) on 10/07/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to BILL COLEMAN re: R/FOXPRO VS PARADOX

You might want to check back issues of DBMS and Data Based Advisor for
articles describing Foxpro.  Fred Kasner can probably tell you all
you want to know and more about Paradox.  On another BBS (I forget
which one) I saw a rather large program described as a "shareware Foxpro
clone"; if I find anything more about it, I'll let you know over on
the Advocate.
My choice of Dbase dialect is Clipper, which by definition requires
programming.  One thing you might want to check out is Clarion Personal
Developer, which is basically an application generator combined with
a runtime module for full-fledged Clarion.  It may be somewhat limited,
but it can now be found for under $50 at many retailers.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/VGA MONITOR ON CGA

Oh thanks! That makes it perfectly clear. Except what kind of monitor
do you need to have composite/CGA/EGA and VGA videos? If one wanted to
buy just one monitor for all? Is there any made? I believe multisync
has CGA/EGA/VGA bases covered, but may lack composite. Hey composite
has an analog video signal too, it's just the resolution isn't so good.

to LARRY GLASSMAN re: R/LOGOPOLIS

Running the software at all seems to be a dead issue. Ran out of ambition
trying to arrange for a CBBS to PC transplant via Ward channels, and I'm
sure the former Logopolis callers (including myself) have all lost interest
by now. I grabbed the backup North Star machine from the land of the greedy
ages ago, then couldn't make contact with you to use it. After months of
on/off trying, I figured it was not to be, and didn't know where I'd put
the Logopolis hardware if I managed to retrieve it from you. <sigh>
Someday, perhaps I'll have a house again...
No dup. chars.
