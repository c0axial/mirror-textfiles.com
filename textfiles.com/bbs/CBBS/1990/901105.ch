Msg 44107 is 06 line(s) on 11/02/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to TONY ANTONUCCI re: 9600 ON CBBS

  Yep, 9600 on CBBS is slower than you'd think it is - but sure is faster
than 2400.  I think what's happening is the fact that I'm sending every char
out to the screen, also - meaning you're limited to the scrolling speed of
the PC CGA display.  (=notoriously slow).
  Also, per comments just a couple days ago from Randy, I'm not "locking the
baud rate at 19,200", thus not taking advantage of MNP level 5 compression.

Msg 44108 is 10 line(s) on 11/02/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: BITSTREAM FACELIFT & DJ

  Just got my Bitstream Facelift package last night - VERY NICE!  It is
scaleable fonts - some up to 72 point!  It worked under Windows (3.0)
Write (up to 36 point) and under PageMaker (72 point).
  The fonts auto-scale on both the screen and the DeskJet printer.  However,
due to this mathematical process, and the fact that it writes to the printer
strictly in graphics mode, it is UNBEARABLY SLOW on my 10mhz system (which
until this time has been adequately fast for me).
  P.S. I called the 800 # yesterday to request an upgrade form for my
DeskJet to upgrade it to a -500.  The + and the -500 are sufficiently faster
in graphics mode that that should help, too.

Msg 44109 is 05 line(s) on 11/02/90 from TONY ANTONUCCI
to WARD re: 9600 CBBS

After having the 9600 for about 12 hours...I love it. I tried some
tests and it does make quite a bit of difference with the baud locked
higher. I locked mine at 38,400 baud and was getting an effective
baud rate of over 19,200 on file transfers (in HST mode on USR duall
standard). But CBBS info would not be that critical.
No msg 44110

to WARD re: THINGS

As it turns out, I DO need the adaptor card, but I suppose I've got a
better chance of finding it alone than finding it with the mounting
hardware as well.
How much are the DJ upgrades?  I just got a DJ on Thursday (Elek-Tek has
them for $330.  I probably don't really need an upgrade, but you know how
it goes....

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/HAMFEST LIST UPDATE

Sure would. I have been composing the list offline and then just
uploading it ascii wise. I had to use a few waits at the end of the line,
but other than that it worked.  I'll have to look at my list of upcoming
events and update the list.  So thanks and I'll get back soon.

Msg 44116 is 10 line(s) on 11/05/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to DONALD DOCKMAN re: R/TURBO-C BOOKS

My basic TC reference is The Waite Group's Turbo C Bible. Despite a couple
of infrequent errors, I find it significantly better than TC's own docs--
which ARE generally good. My favorite supplemental book is Systems
Programming in Turbo C by Young. (The latter's title is misleading. It is
an excellent collection of I/O, TSR and other fxns which are well
integrated. I've pushed well beyond the limits of those fxns, but still
occasionally turn to them when approaching a new need for excellent
insights. Well written. Both (and a large collection of other titles to
suit your personal sensibilities) are available at Krochs in the Loop and
should be generally available elsewhere.

Msg 44117 is 04 line(s) on 11/05/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/NOLOCAL FOR DOS 2.X?

I've experienced a similar difficulty when attempting to locate the current
DIR prior to DOS 3.x and had to develop a "creative" workaround. If you
explore NOCALL's code, I'd bet you'll find an INT 21 Fxn 62h (get PSP)
call...which just happens to have become available in DOS 3.0 :-}.
No dup. chars.

]If any of you would like to call, I have my machine up as a BBS, with
quite a bit of public domain software. You will have to leave your
name, address, phone for downloading, I will validate in 12-24 hours.
On second thought I will allow a "new user" to download.
I thought I would try having a semi-private BBS for awhile, the number
is 708-991-3830
Enjoy.

]Steve Bogolub; Well thanks for trying my BBS out. Yeah some of us have
been around a long time. I have been calling CBBS since 1979, from
my 16K Apple ][ (before the "+"), with a "super-fast" DC Hayes micromodem
110/300 baud, that I modified to go 450 baud (which some S-100 modem
would handle on RCPM systems).
Compared to the current 33Mhz 386 with 8 meg RAM, 700 Meg hard disk,
and 9600 baud modem. One thing has not changed, my printer! I still
have
the slowest, oldest Epson printer. 80cps MX-80. Gee, guess I don't
do
a lot of printing....
Good talking to ya.
