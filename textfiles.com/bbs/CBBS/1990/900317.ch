to JIM LIDDELL re: R/COMPAC RAM HELP NEEDED

Give me a voice call at 708-251-5787 (Wilmette). Call any time, and leave
a message on the machine if I don't pick it up. I've solved stickier
problems than this one before.
P.S. The "out of environment space" message is almost certainly unrelated
to your other problems, and there's a simple fix for it.

Msg 43350 is 08 line(s) on 03/16/90 from BOB CZAJKOWSKI
to ALL re: 400 K DISK FORMAT FOR PC

Can anyone suggest a source for a odd format disk read/write routine?
I am trying to generate CNC code on a 386 system and write it to a disk
that can be read on an Easy-File connected to a Bridgeport NC mill. The
disk format supported by the Easy-File is 512k sectors, 10 sectors per
track and 40 tracks per side, double sided. I have tried jformat but
haven't hit on a combination that works. I have a 1.2 Mb and 1.44 Mb
floppies and 40MB hard drive attached to a hd/fd contoller. Any
suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks, Bob C.

Am writing a test driver that will download a file using xmodem protocol &
have been unable to find the specs for plain vanilla xmodem. Where can
I get the specs?

to ALL re: MAC FORMAT RECOVER

H E L P ! I have a friend who accidentally reformatted his hard disk,
and he has about a year's worth of checks and other financial transactions
on it. Is there a MACE or Norton, or other solution to this problem?
