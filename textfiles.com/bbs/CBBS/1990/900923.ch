500 VA BEST Power Technology true on-line uninterruptible power system
which also provides line conditioning and filtering. Less than a year
old. BEST's units employ ferroresonant transformer technology, which
not only keeps your computer equipment running thru blackouts and deep
brownouts, but traps spikes, sags, surges, lightning, noise and all other
glitches when ComEd is "normal." Original list on the unit was $895. Want
$450, which also includes the batteries. Must sell by Wednesday, Sept. 26,
since I'm leaving town.
