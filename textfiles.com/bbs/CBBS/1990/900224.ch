to PETE GROBAREK re: R/MAIL TO ANOTHER UNIX SYSTEM

 Please, I am "Ward", non the generic "Sysop". Thanks.
 This isn't a unix system. This is the worlds first micro based BBS.
It is written in 8080 assembly language. Fellow-CBBS inventor Randy Suess
DOES have a unix system - chinet. (312) 283-0559 I believe is the public
access number, but non-contributors ($50/year to support the system) don't
get mail or UseNet access, I think.

Msg 43263 is 04 line(s) on 02/22/90 from PAUL STREETER
to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/DEAD MODEM

It is in internal modem. It appears to be really dead. Since new 1200 baud
internal modems go for $50.00 a dead one can't be worth more than $5.00 plus
postage. I can't sell it yet though. SYSLINK is having a users' poll on
what to do with a dead modem, and I may be donating it for first prize.

in this area (312)545-? i am new to this area and don't have any local bbs
info. thanks !

Msg 43265 is 05 line(s) on 02/22/90 from STUART GOLD
to ALL re: DEC VT-100 WANTED

I am looking to purchase a very low cost DEC VT-100 terminal
strictly for analytical usage. If any has a used VT-100 and would
like to sell it, just give me a call days at (312) 582-5465.
If I am on the phone, please leave a message and I will return
your call as soon as possible.

Msg 43266 is 08 line(s) on 02/23/90 from MARTY DIPPEL
to STUART GOLD re: VT100 CLONE

Stuart: I've got a DataMedia model DT80/1 terminal which claims to be
a VT100 clone. I'm not sure if you are looking specifically for a
Digital Equipment Corp. model VT100, or if any of the competition will
do. If you're interested, I'd really like to sell it, as I no longer
have a need for it. CHEAP ( < $50 )! I originally got it to use with
my SYM-1 SBC, then used it for BBSing for quite a while. It's been sitting
in the basement now for a couple of years since I got the computer.
Let me know if you're interested.

Msg 43268 is 05 line(s) on 02/23/90 from JERRY HASLETT
to ALL re: 4DOS BUG?

Help, Help, 4dos 2.0b does not like an entry in the config.sys
file of pcdos on my xt clone. I need this entry in config.sys:
DEVICE=DRIVER.SYS /D:1 so that I can format the second physical
3.5 in. drive at 720k. The pcdos is version 3.21 and works
just fine without 4dos. Any suggestions?

Here are a few items that mightbe useful to Atari Portfolio owners
(potential owners):
You CAN write software for the PF in Borland's Turbo C, select TINY or SMALL
model and use only i/o functions that call DOS. NOT BIOS.
The sound() function in Turbo C will turn the speaker on, but different
frequencies cannot be achived. Just the same as echoing a control G.
dup. chars.
