to JIM POLOUS re: R/NEW YEARS' VIRUS?

My first thought was that someone was playing around with the computer
while you were away; that would be the simplest explanation. It looks like
somehow your FAT got a bit scrambled. Were you by any chance using a
caching program? I've seen that sort of thing happen when someone shut
off a computer with an unflushed write cache. It's conceivable that you had
a power glitch that affected memory without causing the system to reset or
lock up. If you had nothing loaded other than the OS, COMMAND and WP, check
that they compare to their originals (unless your FAT was already partially
corrupted, NOTHING else could have caused the corruption while only those
programs were loaded).

Msg 43008 is 05 line(s) on 01/06/90 from JIM POLOUS
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/NEW YEARS' VIRUS?

No CACHE programs. Only things loaded were a MOUSE driver, DOS and
WP. Noone touched the computer as I had locked the keyboard with the
keyswitch on the front panel. Oh well. I've got about 1/2 my
software reinstalled so far. it's the DATA that is irreplaceable (or
almost)

Msg 43012 is 19 line(s) on 01/07/90 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to ALL re: 1M SIMM BUYING GROUP

I've run across what appears to be a good deal on quantity purchase
of 1M SIMMS (80ns). Someone is offering them for $80 each in qty.
100. Of course I don't need and can't afford 100 of the suckers!
BUT, if enough people are interested, we might pool $ and do a
volume purchase.
 If you are interested, leave me a reply with name and # SIMMS
desired. I'll compile a regularly updated list, and upload
occasionally. When/if we reach 100, we can get together and place
an order.
 To see the benefits of this, imagine you want 4Mb, as I do. If
you purchased through current mailorder prices, I'd guess the cost
would be about $400+. Buying in bulk, your cost would be about $320!
 Of course, I've requested additional info., and will find out
who the mfr.s are, etc. But it sure sounds good.
 BTW, the same company offers 9600b FAX board/2400b modem cards
for $119 (qty. 2), and the same type card with FAX receiving
capabilities ($ unknown at this point). I've also requested info.
on these. If you're interested, let me know!

to CLIFF SHARP re: R/SECOND HARD DRIVE

Yes, a understand the jumpers. My doc that came with the drive, stated to
make both DS2 because I have a twisted cable. Are you aware of a
difference in the cables between floppies and hard disks? My hard
disk cable i got from ELEK-TECH appears to be the sames as my current
floppy cable. the twist is between pins 10 - 16.

Msg 43018 is 04 line(s) on 01/09/90 from STAN BEGGS
to ALL re: 2ND HARD DRIVE

Just to let you know, I finally solved my problem and got both
drives working. The problem was that a few pins on the cable
were defective. I want to thank all who tried to help.
Thanks again.
