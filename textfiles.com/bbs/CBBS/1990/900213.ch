to BILL WOLFF re: R/ANSI EDITOR!

 Actually, a "possible" (<> practical) goal is to get CBBS working in
"C", then ported to Chinet. Being a unix system, it could use its
"terminfo" or what ever the new "termcap" is.
 By the way, CBBS DOES have full-line editing, independent of the
terminal type as long as backspace works OK. Try typing "help full".
 I couldn't get along without it. It has functions of insert (though
only a space, not an insert "mode"), delete, word forward and back,
etc. For example if you noticed a typo in the middle of a line before
entering the line, you can use control keys to go back and correct it.
 Similarly, if you've done the "full" command before going into message
entry, your "E" (line edito) sub-command becomes a full-line edit - great
for even inserting a char, etc. If you recall editors that had repeat
keys, you can even repeat inserts (^W8^V would insert 8 spaces). I
often do ^W^W^V to insert 16 spaces then ^G the ones I don't want, back
out.

Msg 43199 is 09 line(s) on 02/11/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to BILL WOLFF re: R/ANSI EDITOR!

 Oops, It seems I didn't put FULL in the help file. I guess it must have
been in a news item, and I didn't restore the news items after a system
crash some time ago.
 FULL? will tell you how it works (how's THAT for consistency ;-)
^B=Front/back, ^A=Word left, ^S=Char left, ^D=Char right, ^F=Word right
^V=Insert sp., ^G=Del left, ^P=Erase EOL, ^I=Tab right, ^_=CharSearch
 Those are the key meanings after doing a "full" command. With this,
a full SCREEN editor is needed about half as much, since most errors occur
on a LINE.

Msg 43200 is 15 line(s) on 02/11/90 from BILL WOLFF
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/ANSI EDITOR!

Hmm. I am trying the full screen editor now! WOW! It really works! Why
didn't we learn about this before? Thanks! I don't need the ANSI editor
now. As this works even when I am not using ANSI. I noticed it works
fine during the edit function too, as stated. All we need now is a
on-line spelling checker. Maybe a thesaurus too. Hey! Can I ask for a
grammer checker too.

Seriously, this BBS has many hidden tresures I have slowly found over
the years. Who knows? The spelling checker maybe already here!

On another note, nice job on the map about 100 messages before this one.
I hope I got the msg# right! Keep up the nice job and publish some more
tricks that you use here.

Have a good one! <BW>

Msg 43202 is 21 line(s) on 02/11/90 from BILL WOLFF
to ALL re: IT'S SOFTWARE!

Many years I have fought with line noise and such. And over the years, I
have notice a big decrease in line noise. But guess, what?

I found a new love for my old equiptment. Like right now I have been
using my Osborne Executive pretty heavily lately, plus some of my other
CP/M computers instead of my newer MS-DOS, which I normally use.

You guessed it, line noise back again! And I believe it isn't really the
hardware, as different terms breed different problems. Most will upload
and download without any errors. But reading text causes errors.
Sometimes a line feed maybe be missing, or a series of characters are
gone. Plus I am using the same modems and phone lines that my newer
hardware and software are using which they worked without any major
problems.

The cause??? I believe crummy software wehave been using over the years,
doesn't work that well. CrossTalk and MEX are two that routinely cause
problems. And Crosstalk cost big bucks! Even today, it is costly. There
are also a number of CBM terms that do this as well. And after all these
years I have been chasing the wrong cause! Some people never learn! Or at
least not right away! <BW>

 I'd really like to let Randy put this modem on Chinet, so he can

to ROBERT GOLENIA re: R/1M SIMM BUYING GROUP

Bob:
 Sorry about the delayed response (vacation and no laptop!).
Here are some details-the cards are from a noname company in
CA called PC-Alibi (!). Send-only FAX with 2400 bps modem is
$119 each when bought in quantity of 2 or more. They offer a \
5 year warranty, and include software (who knows if it's good?)
They also have a FAX card/modem which sends AND receives FAXs
for $169 (which should be available soon, if not now). Leave
me a msg. if you're still interested.

Msg 43205 is 08 line(s) on 02/12/90 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to JIM REDMAN re: R/1M SIMM BUYING GROUP

Jim:
 Got a bunch of stuff from them in the mail-SEND/REC. FAX/modem
runs $169 per card (I think that's qty. 2 also). I wouldn't mind
splitting a double order if anyone's interested. I'm in the
market for a new modem anyway, and to get FAX capacity in addition
to regular 2400 bps modem for the same price would be fine with me!

Msg 43206 is 05 line(s) on 02/12/90 from GARY ELFRING
to WARD re: DESKJET

My guess is: either they are simply repositioning the DeskJet where it
belongs- against dot matrix printers OR a new DeskJet is on the way.
(Faster with built in RAM for fonts would be my guess and I would call
it a DeskJet II.) Either way with only $75 difference between models
I would guess the days of the original DeskJet are numbered.

I have a question for you about an IBM program called ADM. We have a
client who has a catalog program that was produced quickly (read slap-
dash) under it. We're considering helping them re-do it, but it would
be nice if we could capture the files and avoid all the data entry
required. Do you know anything about the program. It's called ADM.COM
from IBM and it seems to be some type of data base manager. It may be
before your time.but any info would be appreciated. Thanks.

to GERALD PINE re: R/8-INCH DRIVE JUMPER SETTINGS

I'm not so sure any more, (it's been 7 or 8 years), but it seems to me
that there might have been some bios differences between single-sided
and double-sided boards, and it seems odd to me that an 820-II would
have single sided drives. You may want to consider this, if other
suggestions don't work. By that I mean you may not be able to operate
the system with ds drives due toa firmware problem. Xerox offered an
upgrade to its early 820's which consisted of a new motherboard, not
a new eprom and some more memory! You should try comparing the mother-
boards in this and a known dd system, as another approach. If this is
the problem, there ain't no fix for this board, I'll bet. Let us know
any new developments in the saga. I used 820's and -II's a lot while
working for a Xerox division. I'm glad you didn't have one of the
early and really bad 5.25" drive abortions.gross. Regards.
