to ALL re: DOS MEM ALLOCATION?

  I saw a strange situation today: >300K free, yet a 256K program wouldn't
load!  Turned out via PMAP memory mapper, that there was a "hole".  Turns
out a menuing program of sorts, loaded a TSR, then exited.  The hole is where
it was, yet there was no large-enough chunk.
  Does DOS memory have a "bit" saying whether memory is free or something?
I didn't know it could have "holes".  Will DOS prevent things from clobbering
the TSR?
  Thanks!

The Netware 3.01 drivers are available for "free" from Netwire on
CompuServe.  These work with Windows 3.0.... Note that while Windows
claimes compatibility with Netware, there is a small incompatibility:
Running too many things in Windows somehow causes the file server to use
up more memory for tracking purposes. Since the three dynamic memory
pools are fixed and automatically configured depending on the amount
of memory in the system when it was NETGEN'd. Multiple programs run
through windows can cause the server to lock up. Netware 386 is immune
to this problem because of it's ability to dynamically allocate and deallocate
memory at will

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/DOS MEM ALLOCATION?

The problem you ran into is known as "memory fragmentation."  When
you unload a TSR, DOS can't just move everything in memory to fill up
the hole because that would invalidate any pointers in the stuff that's
being moved (no way to do segment fixups after a program has been loaded).
If the TSR were the last thing in memory (i.e. you unloaded it from
a "virgin" command prompt), there would be no hole because the memory
being freed up would be immediately adjacent to the main free space
and DOS is smart enough to combine them into one big block.  The other
major way to cause fragmentation is to load a TSR from within something
else (an application with a "shell to DOS" command).  In this case
the TSR will load after the application.  When you leave the application,
the space it took will be freed but the TSR will still be sitting at
the end of that space, leaving you with non-contiguous free blocks
on either side of it.
About the only way an operating system can solve this problem (other
than by limiting you to COM files) is to use hardware page-mode memory
management to do the allocation--just twiddle the page registers and
the non-contiguous blocks suddenly become contiguous.  That could be
done on a 386, but it wouldn't be DOS-compatible--Hmmm, there just
might be a way to do it transparently, though there might be some memory
loss because the 386 has a 4K page granularity, whereas DOS memory
blocks have a 16-byte granularity.  On second thought, it wouldn't
work--though you could create contiguous blocks of PHYSICAL memory,
you wouldn't be able to change the situation with regards to LOGICAL
memory, which is what DOS wants to see.

Jaime,
Good to see you out and about the BBS community. I hope you find it
as interesting pursuit as I have the last ten years.
Best of luck in your pursuits!
No dup. chars.
