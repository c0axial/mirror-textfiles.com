Msg 43338 is 05 line(s) on 03/12/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: DISKETTE CACHE?

 My Bullet 286 replacement motherboard contains a disk cache, that also
works for diskettes. It is proprietary however (special RAM locations).
 Anyone know of a cache that works for diskettes? I'd like to start
tinkering with moving the Ward Board to a PC, and for how it has a 1.44M
floppy - cacheing would help a lot.

Msg 43339 is 03 line(s) on 03/12/90 from RALPH SIMPSON
to ALL re: DATA CARTRIDGES

Does anyone have any Scotch 300XL data cartridges they would like to sell?
I'm in the market for some. Leave a message here if interested. Any
equivalent other data cartridges would be considered. Thanks.

Msg 43340 is 30 line(s) on 03/13/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: CALCULATOR/ LABELS

I'd welcome additional input on the programmers' calculator. It's
evolving in response to input every couple of days and (barring some
major enhancements in response to user input) should be "done" in the
next week or so. So, while you've kindly supplied your address, the only
really practical way to obtain your input would be for you to grab a copy
from The Advocate/NOWAR, 312.939.4411, 24 hrs., 8/n/1 (South Loop). The
archive is small at this stage (only quickie docs at this point, under
the presumption testers are reasonably computer literate). The msg base
over there contains more info, but in general the archive is in the C1:
directory, under a filename of QM-BETA??.LZH, where ?? is the latest (and
frequently changing) test version number. Note: I try to remember to set
each revision to be downloadable w/out validation. If you call and find
I've neglected to set it for unvalidated downloading, leave me a msg there
and I can set the appropriate bit in the DIR filename to make that possible.

As for labels, there's no written literature. The point was that I
regularly print professional-quality labels for in-house use and am simply
offering to shar some of the cost-savings of a special arrangement I have
with a printer, plus my (true, photo-) typesetting and design. At the
moment, I'm preparing a batch of 2 3/4"-square labels to take to the printer
in the next day or two. (That's the size used for 3.5" disks. But I've
also designed it such that it works well on 5.25" disks.) Other sizes come
up from time to time, and I'd welcome the chance to see if we could gang
up your needs and ours if you'll indicate your needs.If a combined run
is possible, you'll get the same price cuts as in the current batch. If not,
the services will be at my normal rates (hourly for design and typesetting,
printing at trade rates). I know of no lower rates from full-time design
houses anywhere in Chicago, and could provide estimates after determining
your specs. For efficiency, I'd suggest a voice call during business hours:
312.939.3300. Thanx for the inquiries.

Msg 43341 is 09 line(s) on 03/13/90 from BRENT JONES
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/WANT TO CODE?

 Would you be interested in selling GrandView? You shared quite a few
frustrations. I have been looking at the demo of GV which John Friend
had mailed to me. It looks like I could make good use of it.
 Ward, I would suggest that you give a look at PC Outline. It has many
of the same features of GV but I find that by cutting down on the
number of features, it is easier to use.
 You want me to send you a 3.5" disk of PC Outline, just let me know. You
really should look at it if you are frustrated.
 Where did you get GV and how much did you pay?

Msg 43342 is 06 line(s) on 03/13/90 from PHIL SCHUMAN
to ALL re: DBASE IV & MEMORY USAGE ??

In using a dbIV application on a PC with 2meg of extended memory if the 2meg
could be used to help speed it up.
It appears that the manual indicates that EMS and extended memory may be ud
 but other folks have said the AT lies. it can not make use of the memory.
Any thoughts on helping the application out with the 2meg ?? Ram disk or
a disk cache. and if the cache - which program - share or buy ???

Msg 43343 is 04 line(s) on 03/13/90 from DAVE DANIELS
to M: re: G

i have recently installed a 3-1/2" floppy in my "earliest" version ibm-at.
i have not been able to fully foramt to 1.44mb, and have been told by the
experts that i have an old bios version. hwat is the best and quickest way
to correct this

Msg 43344 is 05 line(s) on 03/13/90 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to JERRY OLSEN re: R/CALCULATOR/ LABELS

 Well, so much for labels!? Really hate to D/L anything. I gave that up
with all the bad programs going round in the last year or so. Too busy
to mess with any of that anyway. Will see ablout a D/L somethime. Too
bad about the labels though. I REALLY do need neat looking "laser"
labels.
