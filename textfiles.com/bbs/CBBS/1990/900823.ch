 I've been reading a discussion on BIX about how Wayne Rash is stopping
a column he's been writing for a while for a magazine - because he came down
pretty hard on 1-2-3, at about the same time the mag started accepting
Lotus as a major advertiser. They pulled his column and didn't even tell
him about it! He did about all he could - I believe some "discussions"
ensued, but the net of it is that it looks like he's saying that if they
don't have editorial integrity, he doesn't want to write for them. Too bad.

to JERRY OLSEN re: R/IOCTL USAGE

 Jerry, I have formatted diskettes with the following information passed
to interrupt 13h:
 AH = Command (05 for Format)
 AL = Sector count
 CH = Track number
 CL = Sector number (probly not needed for Format, but I set to 01.)
 DH = Physical drive # (A=0,B=1,etc)
 DL = Head # (0 or 1 for floppies)
 ES:BX = pointer to address list
On return, carry bit is set to indicate failure.
 The address list has four bytes for each sector (see AL) to be formatted.
The bytes are track#, head#, sector#, bytes/256. For formatting track 39
head 0 on a 360K floppy, you would use
 27h,00h,01h,02h,
 .
 27h,00h,09h,02h.
Mess up any of the numbers and you will give DOS fits. Not when you format
the diskette, of course, since BIOS is doing the work, but later when you
want DOS to use the track.
 Hope this helps.

I appreciate the feedback, but while I too have used the BIOS approach, my
current need is for code to plug into a commercially-distributed application.
So I need something without the inherent restrictions of Int 13h. (As but one
example, I need the capability of formatting floppies which rely upon device
drivers.) From what I can determine, the IOCTL approach is necessary. I've
been successful using various of its subfxns in the application already, but
attempting to use its formatting/verify subfxns are a different story.
Perhaps someone else who has already been down this road can help out. Thanx,
though.

Do you or your company need professionally-prepared disk labels for
products or general in-house use? I split my professional day between
graphic arts and software design. With four software products nearing
release, I'm again gathering interested parties together for a ganged
run of labels. The advantage to me is that others share out-of-pocket
costs. The advantage to others is they receive professionally-designed
labels produced with true phototypesetting and printed with commercial
quality offset processes in colored ink on die-cut stock at a small
fraction of normal costs. (These are NOT quick desktop publishing hacks
run on laser printers.) Participation begins at $25. There is still
room for one or two more participants for the current run (before the
end of the month). If you are interested now, want samples or would
like first priority on the next (unscheduled) run, call me voice at
312-939-3300 (afternoons best) or leave me a message on the company
BBS at 312-939-4411 (24 hrs., 300/1200/2400).

Well, the thing about hamfests is that you never know what to expect.
I have attended many of them and I always find at least one dynamite
'deal' that makes it all worth it. Personally, I love to go just to
see the variety of electronics that is there. It's also a great
source of parts. There was a guy selling used but working HP terminals
with a built in printer for 3/$10. Can you beat that? I've bought a
card with 150 ram chips for $10, socketed no less. It's exciting
to say the least when you're a 'junker' like I am! The Grayslake
hamfest has always been a good one. More stuff than you have time to see.
