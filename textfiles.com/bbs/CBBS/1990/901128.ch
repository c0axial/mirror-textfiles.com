The BBS lists are no longer carried here.
They are available on a number of other systems, including:
COPH, 312-286-0608 and
Advocate/Nowar, 312-939-4411.

Msg 44207 is 03 line(s) on 11/28/90 from ART REGAL
to ALL re: GREAT DEALS

I just got a great deal on an AT computer at my local store
in Bartlett.  They have a FCC approved machine for just $595.00.
If you want a good price give them a try.  Their phone is 708 830-4222
No dup. chars.
