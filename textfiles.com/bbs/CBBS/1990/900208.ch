]Hah!  Goes to show how long since I looked in keywords.  That's how
I learned to do r;*;+;+;+: -- must be at least ? 6, 7, 8 ? years ago?
I knew several CBBSs and used them all so as not to stay too long on
one while reading keywords and figuring out how things worked.
There was CASAT and another (Wertheimer??).

 A 1.44M drive compared to a 720K?
 - probably has a higher quality (read: "Finer gap") head;
 - can write at 500KHz (vs 250 for 720K)
 - probably has a media sensor to detect 1.44M diskettes and auto-switch
densities based upon that.

Msg 43166 is 04 line(s) on 02/07/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to GERALD PINE re: R/8-INCH DRIVE JUMPER SETTINGS

 You ARE using double sided MEDIA, no? The single sided drives have
the sensor hole in a different place than the double sided diskettes,
and some drives might detect that and not allow double sided unless
they see the index hole coming from the correct LED.

 Yes, for sure I realize these are the auctioned-off machine. I guess
I just don't understand WHAT Zenith did with this auction. I thought it
meant they were getting out of the PC business, but apparently not - just
buying some capital for other uses?
 So it is probably "OK", but rather old technology, OK, thanks. 14# or
what ever it was seemed kind of heavy.

to BRENT JONES re: R/WANT TO CODE?

 GV has lots going for it, but also much frustration. I don't know
what do to. I use it on a laptop, because I CAN NOT USE IT on my main
system since it kills software Carousel, but more severely, it kills
switching to the resident mainframe commo session.
 Perhaps I should talk to John on CIS with a couple of the most
severe points and see if there's something I am doing wrong. For
example, the sideways scrolling annoys me TERRIBLY, so getting rid of
that would be a good start. But more fundamental things like having
my keyboard redef "global" are probably not the kind of thing he's likely
to want to code.
 Every time I import data into SideKick I'm reminded of how dumb their
implementation of programmable keyboard is - here I've defined all my own
keystrokes (for up, down, left, right, mark, cut to buffer, etc) but
when I hit F4 from SideKick, then I have to remember the obscure
WordStar cursor move and block start/end keys! What BUGS ME is that
they WASTE THE SPACE of having two totally different keyboard maps! (unless
the WS stuff in "clip" is hard-coded).

to BRENT JONES re: R/CLIPPER

 I like the idea of using a Turbo language with its BGI linked in to
show the graphic. An alternative would be to use GRASPRT which is
the give-awayable part of GRASP an animation package, but at almost 80K
it would be overkill.
 Fox comes with an application generator - edit, search, stored queries,
labels, reports, browse, etc. All canned. All you do is make the screens
with FoxView (very nice, BTW - move, change auto labels from left side
to top, or put in your own text, or no text, you can have boxes, etc).
FoxPro apparently blows FOX+ away allowing multiple overlapping windows,
etc. Wish I had an application - so far my Fox Pro is still in the box.

to GARY ELFRING re: R/DESKJET SALE

Do you think the DeskJet rebates - uh, what's the word - "portend" the
coming of yet another model? Perhaps they'll make a big "splash" (heh
heh) about a permanent ink version? (but that SHOULD only be the
cartridge, I'd think). Perhaps a postscript compatible one? (but
that would take a meg of memory!)

Msg 43171 is 05 line(s) on 02/08/90 from JIM DURKIN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: XMODEM FILE TRANSFERS

Using Xmodem protocol to transfer files across a straigt modem link there
is no problem. When we insert a rate adapting step between the modems,
the receiving end sends a nak, but the transmitting end does not respond
to the nak. (This is using Smartcom III, set for 7-E-1). Can you help?
Thank you. James Durkin.

Msg 43172 is 03 line(s) on 02/08/90 from JERRY HASLETT
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: 3.5 IN. DRIVES

Thanks for the info, Ward. Do you know of any reason why a
1.44M drive would not work satisfactorily for both 720k
and also for 1.44M including for each read, write, format?

Msg 43173 is 10 line(s) on 02/08/90 from BILL WOLFF
to JERRY HASLETT re: R/3.5 IN. DRIVES

The difference between 720K and 1.44 is denities. 720K is Double Density
(DD) and 1.44 is QD. The reason any 720K disk drive may not read a 720K
written with a 1.44K disk drive is because the head prints smaller. And
sometimes the fat 720K head can't read it. But the skinny 1.44K drive
can read both real well. The fix is to have one of each.

SIDE NOTE: The C128 computer with 5.25 and 3.5" drives can read any MS-DOS
DD format whether written with a 1.44K drive or not with some programming.
Why CBM can get away with it and IBM and clones can't still boggle my mind.
