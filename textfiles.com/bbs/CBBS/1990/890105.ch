to STAN BEGGS re: R/SECOND HARD DRIVE

 Did you know about the drive select jumpers on the rear of the Seagate
ST225 itself? There should be one solitary little Berg jumper on the back
of the circuit board, near one of the connectors (it's been a while, can't
remember which connector but there's only one jumper or place for one).
That jumper has to be set to the second set of pins on the second drive,
or you'll confuse your poor controller card by presenting two "drive one"s
to it and you'll confuse both drives by making them both respond to the
same commands.

Mike, I downloaded PC Outline from CompuServe in ARC form. But I believe
that it would be available on any BBS that cares good shareware.
 Brown Bag Software has gone to bankruptcy, so who know who will pick up
PC Outline's copywrite. I hope is it Buttonware or some other good
shareware company. PCO is a gold nugget to a person who likes to do
planning.
 What is Qedit like? Where did you get it?
 I've used WordStar and WordPerfect but for quick editing of batch files
I'm now using AHED a tiny WS command type editor. I also go another tiny
editor called UED. It does a good job too.
 Makes you wonder just how many editor interfaces you will meet in one
lifetime! If you can't locate PC Outline, I'll mail you a disk. I'm
so sold on it and have a few "converts", maybe you'll be the next!
 Take care. Brent

to ALL re: HAMFEST

Does anyone know when the annual big HAMFEST will take place?
I have not been there for a few years, but it was held at Arlington and
at a place in Villa Park called the ODEUM (sp?) .
Also, I have materials from ARRL for becoming a novice HAM. Locally,
Spectronics is no longer a HAM store. I am looking for HAM groups, BBS, etc.
Thanks for any help or leads.

Does anyone know of a good BBS in the Dallas area? A technical
BBS like this is what I am looking for.
