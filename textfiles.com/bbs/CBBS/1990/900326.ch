to ALL re: MODEM FOR SALE

For sale CHEAP! Hayes 1200 baud internal modem for IBMPC.
$50.00 or best offer! Leave message here.

Msg 43381 is 08 line(s) on 03/25/90 from BILL WOLFF
to ALL re: DBASE II AND III

I have both dBase II (CP/M) and dBase III Plus (MS-DOS). I don't know
dBase III really well and I am stuck on what version to use. It appears
that dBIII can't read dBII files. I know the biggest limitation with II
is the 32 max field number. So I have manage to live within that limit-
ation. I also use dBII on my MS-DOS computer running CP/M. Although
running it on a real CP/M does run faster.

So what would you do? Continue with dBII or go with dBIII?

Msg 43382 is 10 line(s) on 03/25/90 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/HD CTRLR FLAKY

thanks for the reply! As it turns out, the problm is most likely due
to a flaky motherboard-afted doing major surgery on my machine and an
IBM AT with 2 disk subsystems, I suddenly "cleared up" the problem, and
installed UNIX sys V/3.2 without a hitch! It seems that the problem
was a poorly seated ctrlr board-I refuse to touch it until it's tested
and/or replaced. In the meantime, everything "seems" fine.
 The whole problem seems to have been bad connections between ctrlr
and motherboard in my Spear machine-pending further analysis, I'd
recommend avoiding Spear altogether, since they seem to have trouble
with anything they don't sell themselves!

Msg 43383 is 03 line(s) on 03/25/90 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to JERRY OLSEN re: R/HD CTRLR FLAKY

thanks for your help! the problem was the motherboard, not power
or drive, and i {hope} i've solved it -but i may ask for your aid
again soon!

Msg 43384 is 04 line(s) on 03/25/90 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to JIM POLOUS re: R/HARD DISK WOES

THANKS FOR THE REPLY! IT TURNS OUT THAT THE WHOLE PROBLEM WAS HARDWARE
BASED-I RESEATED MY CONTROLLER BOARD AND EVERYTHING IS OK-BUT
THE MFR. WILL CERTAINLY HEAR ABOUT IT; IT INDICATES THAT THE MOTHER-
BOARD HAS SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS (mbd BY SPEAR TECHNOLOGY, INC.)

Msg 43385 is 02 line(s) on 03/25/90 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/386 BIOS

thanks for the reply, but i guess i don't need it-i've seen them
advertised for around $60 per set new.

Msg 43386 is 05 line(s) on 03/26/90 from RICHARD RYAN
to ALL re: PETROLEUM ENGINEERING DATA

me and a business associate are looking for anybody that knows
anything about engineering for natural gas and or crude oil
engineering data. if you can offer any insight into our plan
please call richard ryan or colin carr at 312-878-4570.


Msg 43387 is 03 line(s) on 03/26/90 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/386 BIOS

Thanks for the message-I saw someone advertising them new at $59.
At any rate, however, I've got the problem solved, and it wasn't the
BIOS.

Msg 43388 is 02 line(s) on 03/26/90 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/HD CTRLR FLAKY

thanks for the tips-turns out the problem was a short in the system
because the motherboard wasn't perfectly mounted-all OK now!

Msg 43389 is 06 line(s) on 03/26/90 from STAN BEGGS
to ALL re: PRINT RE-DIRECTION

I am running pre-packaged software that outputs to LPT1 only. I have
a need to put the report to disk for later editting and transmission
to another remote site. Is there a TSR utility or some other method
of directing the print output originally intended for LPT1 to my
specified disk file?
Thanks
