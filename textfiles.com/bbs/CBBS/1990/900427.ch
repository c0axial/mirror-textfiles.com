]I usually say "asst op" or on a few occasions "asst administrator."
Forgot: is it possible to edit when writing to oplog?
Chaz usually calls us "stormtroopers" but I am not happy with that.

Marty; Yes I have the 80287, and either location would be OK.
I will pick it up, and bring it into the City, as I have business
there Thrus. nite, if not over the weekend would work.
It is the 40 pin type, and 12Mhz.
Please leave your phone number as a comment when you logoff
as an Asst. Sysop here (Sorry Ward."sysop" ONLY for us) :-)
I can get it without you putting it in a msg.

to TONY ANTONUCCI re: R/80287

Great, Tony! Sunday would be best, as I have a wedding to attend on Sat.
I'll leave a comment to the "sysop" (obviously NOT meaning Ward :-) )
when I log off. We have an answering machine; If we're not around just
then, leave a message. Thanks!
If Sunday's no good, we can renegotiate either here or via phone.

to ALL re: DOS 3.3 HEADACHE

I have a problem using DOS 3.3 and my clone compatible. My bios is pheonix
and am currently using DOS 3.2 when I upgraded to 3.3, I could only get
things to work properly if I slowed my processor down to 4.77 mhz. at
10 mhz turbo mode, my menu system couldn't send the necessary stuff to
the command line to execute any applications. anyone seen this happen
before?
What can I do?
