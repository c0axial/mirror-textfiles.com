Msg 43697 is 15 line(s) on 06/14/90 from SCOTT SMITH
to GARRETT DERNER re: CLIPPER

Most of the software our company writes involves very large drives,
i.e. 330Mb+. We seldom if ever use SHARE, primarily because we
usually avoid DOS 4.xx and stick with 3.3. Also, about 90% involves
Novell's Netware, which seems to allow us more flexibility when
using large drives than a single-user workstation would.
I've noticed some of the suggestions involving SHARE, and would offer
one other note: to flush the disk buffers, use the COMMIT command after
writing your data to the file. This forces a disk write, insuring
that the data is not "lost" in RAM, as some of the suggestions imply.
We seldom have problems traceable to not COMMITing the buffers, though.
We make use of Storage Dimensions SpeedStor & Ontrack's DMN disk mgrs
for partitioning, thereby avoiding many of the problems you and others
encounter. You should not be running into this problem with 4.01,
however. I have a Clipper app on a PS/2-70 w/ the 120 Mb drive, using
4.01 & SHARE, with no problems.
