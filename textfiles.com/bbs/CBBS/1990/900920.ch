]..OK, I patched CBBS to give it a longer time delay.  I'm gonna call ChiNet
and have randy try it with the turbo switch on.  If it works, I'll patch
the code on disk (now just in memory).

]Used to be that cbbs would respond after 3 <cr>s (although said
"lots" of <cr>s.  In recent weeks sometimes it required lots --
like 7 or so.  Now it responds to 3 again.

Well well. Long time no type. How's the Logopolis hardware these days?
I tried to get ahold of you for the longest time, then gave it up.

I'm interested in phone numbers of local and long distance BBS' and Data
bases.  I will check this BBS again on 90/09/21/01:00

Poorly designed workstations and inefficient body usage can lead to unne
ary aches and pains, which can take alot of the fun out of computing
Rearranging a few simple things in the work station can eliminate
most of these problems.  If you are having soreness or pain in your arms,
shoulders, neck, or back perhaps I can help.  I offer my services as
an ergonomic consultant, exercise consultant, massage therapist and
acupuncturist.  If you are interested in my services, or just have some
questions you would like answered, then please contact me at
708-530-5371 voice phone, or leave a message on the BBS

Fred Kasner, a caller to a BBS I run, seems to have an answer to 'most
every Apple ][ question. (He was heavily into the beast till he moved
primarily into the DOS world.) If you'd like to post him a msg, call:
The Advocate/NOWAR, 312.939.4411, 24 hrs., 8/n/1 (Loop area).

Msg 43958 is 04 line(s) on 09/19/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to JAIME COBB re: R/OTHER BBS NUMBERS

The BBS I mentioned in the previous msg has seven (I think) local/national
BBS lists--searchable, downloadable (after validation), etc. After reaching
the message-base prompt there, use the <C> function to go to the operating
system, then type BBSLISTS for details.

to GERALD PINE re: R/ALTOS HD

I'm not specifically familiar with the Altos, but my experience with CP/M
systems is the parameters expected for drives are hard-coded into the BIOS.
I don't recall whether some simple poking of new values would work in a
situation such as yours or whether layout-table values are required (which
almost certainly would mean you wouldn't have sufficient room to add enough
new values for your much-larger drive w/out serious BIOS hacking). As truly
horrible as CP/M manuals were, the ones with which I was familiar did
provide the necessary details, however cryptically, in their discussion of
Disk Parameter Tables. (I just blew the dust off a copy here, and a VERY
quick glance suggests some modification of existing bytes might do the
trick for you. It would require an experienced hacker, however.) Good luck.
No dup. chars.
