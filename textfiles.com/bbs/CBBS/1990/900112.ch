 Hey Eddie, good to hear from 'ya! Sounds like you're right in the middle
of things!
 What is "Concurrent C"? I pretty much understood all the other terms.

 Glad we got the network going! We should have understood more about how
much (or little) the wiring guys knew, and should have gotten our wiring
specialists out earlier! I can't believe that I was commenting in the AM
how nice it would be (and how "possible") to have a "box" that you could stick
wires into, and wiggle them and check for continuity, polarity, etc - when
Tom Kornaus shows up WITH such a box! Someone told me he'd invented it!

Oops! I entered msg 43006, then "couldn't resist" replacing a dummy
43000 msg as a nice "round" number for the party. I edited the summary
and made 43006 into 43000, and copied it back, but then decided to "leave
it" as 43006 as a 'pointer' back to 43000 for people who'd logged on since
43000 had been entered (since it wouldn't be "new"). Owell, long story,
I shouldn't have "screwed around".
 Thanks for pointing out the msg # discrepancy. I fixed it.

to J.L. RAMEY re: HARD DRIVE OPTION

 Mr. Ramey, Tim has offered to sell his hardrive for 200.00.
It is a seagate 30MB hardrive with 28ms access time. It is well worth
i]the investment.
 In addition, I have a few numerical integration programs to assist
you with your calculus II course this semester.

Richard,

Don't hesitate to to order and use it.

It's a fine product and will work very well, provided you READ the
manuka that comes with it.

to WARD re: CHARACTER BASED MAPS

 Hey Ward you should let us all know either 1) how long it took you
to draw the map (message #43000) or 2) what neat software you used.
 Or maybe you wrote some software that does map making in pure
un-refined ASCII? I think the party is a great idea. One sad
thing about modern society is we don't celebrate enough. Or perhaps
we just end up celbrating the "commercially profitable hollidays"?

Concurrent C is something which was developed at AT&T as an
extension to C or C+ which suppots parallel processing.
That is additional syntax is provided for that purpose. Basically it is a
version of CFRONT the AT&T "translator" that runs as a precompiler
processes the C+ and or CONCURRENT C+ stuff and then emits C source
to a C compiler. It's particularly interesting of course to
anyone using multiprocessors but has applicablity to machines such
as 386's running OS/2 (since in that case Concurrent C/C+ can
handle all of the thread stuff transparently).
The author of Concurrent C/C+ is a gentleman by the name of Narain
Gehani and he has a book out called Concurrent C by Silicon Press.
He has also authored a number of articles on the subject.
Incidently we are starting the C+ Journal in March and have
an impressive array of contributors and an outstanding advisory
board. If you know anyone who might be interested please have them contact us.
We are also doing some pretty exciting stuff in the PostScript/ MS
Windows area . Hope to talk to you via voice one of these days.
Will you be going to Software Development '90 sponsored by
Computer Language??? (In San Fran in Feb???) If so perhaps we can
get together there. We have a booth there. Anyway hope to speak to you soon.
regards
eddie
