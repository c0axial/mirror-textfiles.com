Msg 43985 is 17 line(s) on 09/29/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: COMPARE PROGRAM?

 I've been using CMP, which is a nice compare program whose output
format is like a hex dump, with '.' for bytes that are the same, otherwise
hex for bytes that are different. Thus
 Differences in file #1:
0040 . . . 03 . . FA . . . . . . . . FF
 Differences in file #2:
0040 . . . 04 . . FB . . . . . . . . 00
 Etc. All lines that are the same are suppressed. The nice thing about the
program is that the files DON'T HAVE TO BE THE SAME LENGTH, unlike silly DOS
COMP program. For example you might have a config file for a new vers of
Quattro Pro, that is a few bytes longer than the old one, but you want to do
a compare - such as to try to figure out where the old version changed the
bytes for screen colors, etc.
 WHY AM I LOOKING? Because the old one won't take PATHS. I must move the
files to different disks if they have the same name in diff directories in
one disk!
 Thanks for any suggestions.

to ALL re: COMPOSITE/RGB MONITOR WANTED!

 I have been looking for one of those composite/RGB type monitors that
supports both video inputs. All EGA and VGA monitors lack (as far as I know)
any composite input at all. Only one exception that I know of is the Amiga
monitor. But that is about EGA quality. I would like VGA quality, but would
take even CGA, if the price was right.
 I have looked at both Service Merchandise and Computer Direct and found
nothing but that Amiga monitor. Computer Direct may get some in the future
though. I wasn't worried about these types of monitors because they where all
over the place. Now you can't seem to find them.
 They are handy for CGA cards and also work as VCR monitors too. Maybe that
is where they all are at? Who knows? <BW>

If you still have those Hayes 2400 baud modems, I would like to buy one of
them. I already have one and a HAYES 1200 baud. But I have lots of computers
and only one 2400 baud modem. Thanks! <BW>

I might be interested in that 2400 baud modem. What features does it have
that are different then a 2400 Hayes? <BW>

What are the features and commands that are used in the undocumented feature
of the FULL command again? <BW>

to ALL re: SOUND BLASTER + ANIMATOR

Does anybody have any experience using the SoundBlaster card with AutoDesk
Animator animations?  We're using the SB developer's kit with QuickBASIC and
are trying to simultaneously run a soundtrack with an animation sequence. Any
info would be greatly appreciated.

 Oh! I thought you also had some 2400 baud HAYES for sale. Sorry! If you find
