to ALL re: IMS BASIC

Does anyone have information about IMS Basic? What is it? How is it
different from Microsoft versions?
What type of hardware does it run on?
I'm looking at a short term job fixing some problems using this BASIC
and they don't have any manuals. (hmph!)
Any light on this would be appreciated.

to ALL re: DRHALO/WP5.1 GRAPH CNVRSN

If anyone knows a bit about wordperfect 5.1 and their graphic
conversion command, I could use some help. I have a free and
useful copy of drhalo v3, which 5.1 claims to convert, but only
if the drhalo file has been saved in the "DHP" format. Nowhere
in drhalo, which came bundled with a mouse, is there mention of
a DHP format. I know Hi-Jaak can handle this conversion- anybody
got an idea on another way to do it, sans monetary outlay?
