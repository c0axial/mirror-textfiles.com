]Although I like having MNP here (at 2400 baud), Chinet could probably
use the 9600 to better advantage, especially for people with HSTs who
read a lot of newsgroups.  So only a little teeny not-quite-an-objection
here.

to JIM REDMAN re: R/WHERE'S THE NOISE?

USR 9600 installed last week. Must be a better modem - or perhaps
you, like me, have MNP capability? I guess if CBBS goes back to 2400
so Randy can have a 2nd 9600 on Chinet (which surely needs it better -
tons more info per day there - etc) we should at least go to a better
modem here - perhaps MNP?

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/SMALL PC?

Hmm. wouldn't you be better off buying a cheap ready made clone?
Or perhaps if space is a problem, a XT laptop with a V20 CPU!

Msg 43241 is 05 line(s) on 02/19/90 from JIM POLOUS
to ALL re: TINY MSDOS COMPUTER

I just purchased the new Atari Portfolio MS-DOS based computer. In fact
I am using it now to access the system. It has a very readable 8 x 40
character display and a small, but easy to adapt to keyboard. I downloaded
this terminal emulator for it from CompuServe, if anyone wants any more
information about it, just let me know. happy to explain.

Msg 43242 is 05 line(s) on 02/19/90 from JOSEPH SKOM
to JIM POLOUS re: R/TINY MSDOS COMPUTER

Jim,
 I was thinking of picking this one up, but I have a question. If
it doesn't come with a terminal program, how did you access
CompuServe to get the terminal emulator? If you can tell me that,
I will definitely pick up this cool machine.

Msg 43243 is 09 line(s) on 02/19/90 from BILL WOLFF
to JIM POLOUS re: R/TINY MSDOS COMPUTER

From what I know about the new Atari Portfolio, it is very much like
Epson's PX-8 Geneva. Except the Geneva is/was a CP/M computer. It has
and does serve my well. It's version of SuperCalc, isn't compatible
with anything although. But WordStar, Term, CP/M utilities, etc. are
excellent.

In fact, some maybe better off with a CP/M laptop with 128K than with
a MS-DOS with 128K. Because with CP/M with 64K, you can run almost
anything. But with MS-DOS with 128K, you can run almost nothing!

Msg 43244 is 02 line(s) on 02/19/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to WARD re: LINE NOISE

I don't use MNP, and the line noise is gone for me as well. I use a
plain old Courier 2400.

Msg 43245 is 02 line(s) on 02/20/90 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to WARD re: APCU MEETING

I hear a rumor that APCU is meeting this week sometime. Do you
have info on when and where? Thanks in advance.
