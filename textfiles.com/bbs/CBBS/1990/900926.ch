to JOE SEROCKI re: R/PS/2 MEMORY BOARD 4SALE

  Hi, Joe!  LTNS!  It would help if you said that your PS/2 board was
16 bits or 32 bits, and what speed, etc - or at least what machine YOU
are using it in.  "PS/2" is kinds generic.

Msg 43970 is 03 line(s) on 09/23/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JOE SEROCKI re: R/SIMMS FOR SALE

  Sorry to do it again, but there are 4 kinds of SIMMs - 8-bit (MAC),
generic 9-bit, 9-bit IBM, and 9-bit Compaq.  Again, it would help to say
which kind you are selling.

Msg 43971 is 15 line(s) on 09/23/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to CHARLIE KESTNER re: DISKS

  Yep, got your disks.  I've loaned my VGA display to a friend whose is
going out, so I have no access to 1.44 drives for a while... thanks for
the goodies, I'll put together a list of what I can't do without.  Let me
think:
  - CED: command editor and synonyms - replaces all your little bat files
  - TreeView: great directory program, 30 user programmable function keys, etc.
  - LHARC - in case you find an .lzh file and don't have an un-arcer for it
  - CtrlAlt - a great little utility for cut-and-paste off the screen, etc.
  - Skey/Batutil - stack keystrokes, etc.
  - BURNOUT - vga screen blanker
  ---
  How'z that list sound?  Any you already have or don't want?
  Some are freebies, others are shareware.  Interesting, the only "daily
use" program I have that is strictly commercial, are my editors - PMate
and Kedit.  (and of course YAM commo program).

Msg 43972 is 07 line(s) on 09/23/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to EDGAR COUDAL re: R/UPS FOR SALE

  Sorry to see 'ya leavin!  Hope you sell the UPS!  I've often thought
about one, such as when my system glitches 3-4 times in a couple minutes-
or when I come home to have my non-auto-start fluorescents dark due to
power outage, etc.  BUT I really can't justify one - I've never had a
power glitch hurt things.  Also, I got quite scared when someone mentioned
a UPS that caught fire - would have burned the house down if it had been
near a curtain ;-(

If there is any interest at all in the Amiga computer, I think some reference
should be made to that fact in your intro message.

A while ago therewas some interest in Mark Williams COHERENT.
Has anybody gotten it? Any feedback? Is it worth 99 buckaroos????
What hardware is it installed on? I'm interested in your ideas.

I just got done talking to Quarterdeck about QEMM 5.1, which is
supposed to fix compatibility problems with Windows 3.0. They're
supposed to send an update to 5.0 (any time now). Anybody using
5.1 now? With Windows? 5.0 does a great job everywhere outside
of Windows 3.0 for me and I'm quite pleased with it in general.
