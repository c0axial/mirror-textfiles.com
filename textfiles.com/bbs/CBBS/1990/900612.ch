I zapped the line a few times by picking up the phone, it slowed

]Nah, Ward, don't believe a word of it. You are not famous.  You
haven't made the cover of Time.  On the other hand, I do have to
admit that your name appears on thousands of BBSs and probably
several *million* pieces of software: "We use the Christensen
protocol."  Most of them succeed in spelling Christensen and
"protocol" correctly.  You kU

 I put the May 90 issue of Stillwaters up on Chinet in
/usr/public.
 Will _try_ to keep doing this on a monthly basis, if you
are still interested in putting it up here.

 Recently sent you some email (from chinet), but it looks
like it might have bounced. Have you gotten anything from
me?

hi alex, its soup. give me a call when you can.

to BILL ACKERMAN re: R/NEW UNIX SYSTEM

Bill:
 Just saw your message tonight. I've noticed ads for Coherent and
thought "what a great deal! Now what's the catch?" (still succumbing
to the old you-get-what-you pay-for philosophy!) I'd like to hear
about your experiences also-I'm running Everex's (cheap!) release of
V/3.2 and so will not make any radical changes real soon, but I like
the approach Mark Williams is taking. So, let us know: is it really
a UNIX clone, and what are the pros and cons?
 Looking forward to hearing from you!
 Colin
