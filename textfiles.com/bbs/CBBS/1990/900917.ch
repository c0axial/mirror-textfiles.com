  A good example of the latter (someone who gets unsolicited things
to "review") is Jerry P in Byte - he sure gets a lot of stuff!  A rather
enviable job!

Thanks much for the scoop on Magee Ent.!  I'll give them a ring tomorrow
and see what's happening.  Their system sounds impressive--maybe I'll
get a chance to go out and see it.  Hope all's well with you!  I'll be
in touch and will let you know if anything good comes of my contact
with Magee.
