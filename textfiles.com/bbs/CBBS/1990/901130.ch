to ALL re: BEST DESKJET PAPER

  Now that James River isn't selling their Ink Jet Ultra, which is the
best?  I've heard good things about Hammermill, but I didn't realize how
many different kinds they have:
 Price  Name
 /ream
  7.20  Laser Plus
  5.25  Laser Print
  3.99  Xero/Lasercopy
  They also have some "copier" papers, ranging from 2.99 to 4.50.
  Laser plus says "Wax holdout won't bleed through when used for a paste up".
What does that mean?  Does that mean the paper is extra "waxy", which would
be bad for a water-based printer like the DeskJet.
  I'm tempted to just buy one ream of each paper and do some testing.
  Thanks for any ideas.

  Anyone quite familiar with this?  I have a shrink-wrapped copy, and am
sorry that I now see the outside says "requires at least 256K of exTended
memory".  I've customized my machine to have ONLY exPanded memory, since
"almost everything" likes expanded, and few things (though, admittedly,
more lately) require exTended.  To get extended, I'd have to open my
machine, change switches, etc.  Thus I'm NOT going to have exTended.

to ALL re: QQ:  RESET SWITCH FOR AN AT?

I'd like to install a reset switch on my IBM-AT.  It seems like it
should be a simple matter of two pieces of wire, two alligator clips,
and one push-button.  Anyone know where to attach the clips?  (Besides
"to the wires"?)

Msg 44211 is 04 line(s) on 11/29/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to WARD re: DESKJET PAPER

I've found that the Hammerhill long-grain bond paper (UPC code 10004 for
white, $4.50/ream at Elek-Tek) seems to do the job.  The xero/lasercopy
paper makes the ink smear slightly, especially in draft mode (it's not
real noticeable unless you look closely, but...).

Msg 44212 is 05 line(s) on 11/29/90 from DENNIS STAHL
to ROY LIPSCOMB re: AT RESET

I have put one on mine (about 4 years ago) with no problems.  I don't
recall EXACTLY where I connected it (I am at work, the machine is at
home).  I will look for my schematic at home as I'm sure I marked it up.
I probably just took the output of one of the clock gates and pulled it
up or down.

Msg 44213 is 05 line(s) on 11/29/90 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/ADOBE TYPE MANAGER?

  It seems the bigger packages need to be opened outside the
store and checked for hardware requirements and returned asap
if it starts to list pages and stuff we don't have. After I
read the stuff in PC Paintbrush IV Plus I was almost afraid
I had a lemon but it fits in with a full 386 OK.

Msg 44214 is 06 line(s) on 11/30/90 from TONY ANTONUCCI
to ALL re: BBS

I have a machine online as a BBS if anyone would like to call.
Quite a bit of public doman software available for downloading
on your first call. 1200,2400,9600 baud HST modem. Message system, etc.
I'm toying with leaving the system up if there is interest.
(708) 991-3830
Enjoy.

about uploads (we take anything), and support IBM and Amiga.  The number
is: 708-687-8212.  Hope to see you on the board soon.  Thanks, Cindy
