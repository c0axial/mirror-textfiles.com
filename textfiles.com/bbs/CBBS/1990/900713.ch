to JIM BROWN re: CDW GRAND OPENING

 Heh heh. "Grand" opening? I DO shop at the Grand (Avenue) store in
downtown - because it is walking distance from work. Schaumburg, lets see,
that's about 50 driving miles from me, I think.
 Best service in the world? Hmmm. Got a pretty nasty letter read at our
last club meeting - a guy who charged a display and was promised fast
delivery, but I think NEVER got it. 'course, his living in the Virgin
Islands might have been a problem (grin).
 I've been VERY pleased with the CDW on Grand - 527-2700. Jay is a nice
guy to deal with. I bought a T1000XE, case, and drive from him.

The 30-286 WILL accept 1 or 2 2M simms on the motherboard, IBM feature
number 7833, but unfortunately that's ALL I deal with, so I just don't
know if they are "like generic". I don't know how you'd find out. I
for that matter, don't know how I'D find out! I guess I would try to
find a dealer, and look at a REAL IBM part, and a generic part, and see
if they look "identical" (# of pins, mechanical mounting, etc).

to BILL WOLFF re: R/COMMODORE AND MS-DOS MAGS?

 Saw an interesting article about PC mag. Basically, it said it is NOT
an unbiased publication; and how "editor's choice" can make or break a
company, etc. It also commented on how it pushes the high-end stuff,
but lets face it, that seems to be where the advertising $ are! You need
to go to a Computer Shopper if you want jillions of ads for low cost
machines - though I see most ads running from turbo '88s to 386 and even
an occasional 486.

to CLIFF SHARP re: R/PROPIETARY MEMORY SIMM'S?

 No, sorry, I really have NO idea what the diff between (1) generic,
(2) Compaq, and (3) IBM simms are. It could be the mechanical mounting,
or something more major like the # of pins, etc. I've just never had
an opp'y to see 'em or read any details.

to JOE SEROCKI re: R/IBM HARD DRIVES FOR SALE

 Genuine IBM hard drives? (not sure what you meant by "IBM" hard drives,
i.e. what is "IBM" about them?)
 What sort of photo equipment are you looking for? I have a complete
darkroom that I've not used in YEARS, so have at least at times considered
getting rid of it. I've got an enlarger, safelight, trays, tongs,
thermometers, developing tanks, etc. I also have a Canon FTBn cmaera,
if I remember right - and while it was top notch in its day, it is probably
somewhat obsolete, yet a darn good camera. (I DID remove the battery from
it while in storage).
 I'm looking for a drive for my BBS-in-the-making. What kind of usage have
these drives had?
 Thanks.

to ALL re: ROBOTS

 Hi, my name is John W. Gutmann. I am looking for individuals who are
interested in building Hobby Robots. The kind that move, manipulate
sense and emitt under manual, remote or computer control. I have started
a personal campaign to call BBS's across the USA looking for Robot
Builders. If you have built one or are currently working on one please
contact me. I can be reached on the ROBOTS R4U BBS in Atlanta, Georgia.
(404)-978-7300 3/12/24 baud, 8N1, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
 When you call you will be given full access to over 60 bulletins,
400+ messages, and 10+ files for Robotics. This is a new Board 1/5/90
so the file section needs some uploads for Robotic specific software.
 If you know of some robotic information please prepare a message
describing this information and a message about yourself, so callers can
reply to your message. The system is running RBBS ver 17 software.
 Prepare your message before calling, and you can batch ASCII upload
into the message section. This will save you time and phone call money.
The message section is 75 char by 19 lines, so format it before calling.
 In 1981 I started the first Hobby Robot club in Atlanta. We are
currently meeting at Georgia Tech, Howey physics building.
Robots R4U, P.O. box 2050, Stn Mtn, Georgia 30086 My Thanks to the sysop.
