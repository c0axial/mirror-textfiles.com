to BRENT JONES re: R/GRANDVIEW/PCO

 Got a call from Symantek (?) customer support today, (the GrandView
folks), and they solved my problems pretty well, as well as taking down a
few points as "requests for future releases", some as "sorry, that's the
way it works", and at least one as a true bug report (they say they support
the HP Think Jet, but turns out only to be supported when "epson emulation"
is turned on).
 The "scrolling sideways" problem was solved by a VERY complex set of things,
I think part of it is that Grandview tried to do TOO much - I was working
with "paragraph styles" trying to come up with a narrower line, but it turned
out to be tied to PRINTER width, in a rather obscure way. Basically they
said "everyone seems to have trouble with that area, we're working on figuring
out how to rewrite the book".
 The BIGGEST hassle, namely that it kept me from hot-keying to some other
things, was able to be fixed in some little add-on publication that I seemed
to not have noticed "1.1 release notes" or something like that - since I
didn't know the product at ALL, the "intricacies" of what it talked about
weren't of interest on day one, but later they were they key to some
confusion.
 Anyway, the tech support was great, and I'm pretty satisfied now.
 Thanks for your comments on PCO - the version I tried was probably 3-4
years ago, things might have happened since then.

Msg 43378 is 08 line(s) on 03/23/90 from JIM POLOUS
to COLIN SHROEDER re: HARD DISK WOES

Once I amazed my boss with the solution to a similar problem. Although
we didn't try it on a different machine, it worked. We could boot from
floppy and format or copy software to the hard disk, put the system on
it (they tried two DOS versions). When I overheard a discussion I told them
what I'm going to tell you: Load FDISK. Choose 'Display Partition Information'
See if the status of the primary partition is 'A' or 'Active'. If So, then
it's something else. If not, go to 'Change Active Partition'
and make the Primary partition the active one. Good Luck.

Bob, John Mundt who is on here occasionaly and is a regular on Randy's
UNIX board, has written a couple of commercial programs in C and compiled
them to run on the Apple. I think he used the Aztec Compiler but I'm not
positive. I'm sure you can leave mail for him at Randy's.
