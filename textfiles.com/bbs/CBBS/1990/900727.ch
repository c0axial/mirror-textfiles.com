to ED FOSTER re: R/WHADDAYAKNOW?

 Not only did I watch it (once) but I went to the taping (Thurs PM) of
the one I watched. This is the 3rd time I've seen Feldman live. The TV
show does leave something to be desired - I think it is that we are used to
the 2 hour format, and there is just too much that has to be cut. The ONE
thing I WOULD like to see, would be the screwey prizes - i.e. what DOES
a solar powered fan cap look like? However, they elect to not show the
prizes.
 Computers: I get a kick out of how many people in his audience work with
or are involved with computers! When I filled in the audience card, and
it asked for a quick description, I put down something like "another one of
those darned computer people". ;-)
 A friend(*) from IBM was on the quiz one day - and made a complete fool of
himself. When he was doing poorly, he was givven a "gimme" question: "do
snail shells south of the equator spiral in the opposite direction from
those north of the equator?" I yelled to my radio "YA, Russ! Go! He's
giving you one!". He answered "yes", and I about died ;-). The ONLY good
news was that he said he "worked for a large computer company" ;-)
 (*) Actually I've not seen him in quite a while, but he was one of the
people who started in the same "very first class" as I MANY years ago.

to BRIAN MOWERS re: XMODEM

 Sorry, I have nothing but bad news for you.
 1. Please don't call me "sysop", I just HATE that "generic term"
 2. I have no idea where to go for source for file transfer listings. I
really mean I have lots of sources - Compuserve, Bix, Public (Software)
Library, local download boards, etc, but I have not kept up with such things
and have no SPECIFIC places or things in mind.
 I have no idea other than the above "generic list" of where to find add'l
protocol info - e.g. Ymodem, etc. There are YMODEM doc files that I recall
seeing on the IBMCOM forum on Compuserve many years ago, and I presume they're
still there.
 Sorry.

Msg 43846 is 04 line(s) on 07/26/90 from TOM PRODEHL
to JERRY OLSEN re: R/ACCESSING DOS SUBDIRS

TO access a subdirectory file you use find first and find next functions.
There arr no defined file access functions for 'reading' subdirectories.
the onll other way is the acess the disk ddrectly. Do you want to do that?
?
