to BRENT JONES re: R/USE LOCAL BBS?

 No, really don't use other local Chicago boards - I occasionally drop
by advocate_nowar_jerry_ols speed 2400;1-312-939-4411, and a private
board "Cat's Scratch-N-Post", and Randy's Chinet system, but that's about
it.

Msg 43778 is 02 line(s) on 07/07/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to BRENT JONES re: R/USE LOCAL BBS?

 I forgot - I use Gene Plantz' system when I want to DL something that
is not on CIS.

Msg 43779 is 05 line(s) on 07/07/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JOHN SERRANO re: R/PROPIETARY MEMORY SIMM'S?

 Yes, I think that's right - there are 4 kinds of SIMMs that I've heard of:
- IBM
- Compaq
- Generic
- Apple

Msg 43780 is 20 line(s) on 07/08/90 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to PHIL SCHUMAN re: COPY "*" BUG

Phil, here's a long-shot: Did you, at any time before you did "COPY '*',
run a batch job that has a line that contains both an "IF" statement
and a ">" symbol? For instance,
.
 "IF .%1==.%H ECHO HI >FILE.NEW"
.
I have found peculiar things happen to various operations in DOS after
more than 24 or 25 such lines have been executed since the last reboot.
.
For your problem, I did "COPY X+Y+Z W", where X, Y, Z each end with a EOF.
At first, the "COPY '*'" operation worked as you would have liked. Then I
executed "IF .%1==.%1 REM >X" 30 times. Finally, I tried the "COPY '*'"
command again. The result was that only the first in the string of files to
be copied actually appeared in the output file. (From the error messages,
I conclude that DOS leaves the redirected file open in each "IF" statement,
so that DOS eventually runs out of file handles.)
.
Admittedly, I tested your particular problem only under DOS 2.10 (the only
DOS available to me at the moment), but it should be simple enough to check
with a reboot and a batch file on your system.

Msg 43781 is 04 line(s) on 07/08/90 from JOHN SERRANO
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/PROPIETARY MEMORY SIMM'S?

About the PS/2 series, since the PS/2 model 30-286 is essentially an
IBM AT in a low-profile box, couldn't I just pop in some generic SIMMs?
It's not like that I'm dealing with MCA, or a 32 bit memory path-just a
16 bit microprocessor.

Msg 43782 is 13 line(s) on 07/08/90 from BILL WOLFF
to ALL re: COMMODORE AND MS-DOS MAGS?

What is going on here? First I hear that Commodore 8-bit magazines are
going through hard times. Ahoy goes out of business, INFO drops 8-bit
support, RUN gets thin with cheap paper, Compute!'s Gazette merges
back with Compute! and gets bought out by Penthouse (what kind of
centerfolds are we going to get?) and guess what I just heard?

That's right! Rumor has it that PC Resource and Personal Computing
Magazine have printed their last issues. Now these are MS-DOS mags!
What is going on here? What's next? No 16-bit MS-DOS computers? Has
everyone gone nuts?

And did you hear that Commodore is selling stocks like crazy? I just
can't figure anything out anymore! (Sigh) <BW>

Msg 43783 is 06 line(s) on 07/08/90 from SAMIR SHYAMANI
to ALL re: DOS 4.01 DEVICE DRIVERS

I have received with my copy of DOS 4.01 3 device drivers for which I
did not receive documentation. I would appreciate any help in terms of
instructions on how to use them. They are XMA2EMS.SYS, EMM386.SYS and
HIMEM.SYS.
 Thanks,
 Sam

Msg 43784 is 02 line(s) on 07/09/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to PHIL SCHUMAN re: R/COPY '*' BUG

Your last msg clarified what you were trying to ask. I just did a quickie
test under a fairly vanilla MS-DOS 3.21 and no problems were experienced.

Msg 43785 is 03 line(s) on 07/09/90 from CLIFF SHARP
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/PROPIETARY MEMORY SIMM'S?

 Any idea what the differences are between the different types of SIMMs?
I had the impression that the only difference with Apple SIMMs was that
they're 8-bit instead of 9-bit.
