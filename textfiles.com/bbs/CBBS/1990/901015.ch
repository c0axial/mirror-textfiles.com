Msg 44045 is 08 line(s) on 10/14/90 from MICHAEL SHARTIAG
to ALL re: PC/AT FLOPPY PROBLEMS

 I have recently come across an original IBM/AT machine. The
problem I am having is with the floppy disk and its capacity. As the
IBM books, and the CMOS setup contain High density settings and the
drive is the grey color, and to the best of my knowledge the new
density was one of the AT's selling features, I am assuming it is
in fact a HD drive. Does anyone have any info on why I might be
having a problem getting 1.2 meg. When issued the format command, all
I get are 360K formats.

to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: PC/AT FLOPPY PROBLEMS

The low-density drive on the original IBM/AT has an embossed asterisk
under the diskette slot, positioned the same distance from the side of
the face plate as the drive-select light. The high-density drives look
exactly the same except no asterisk. Is it possible that a low-density
drive was substituted for a bad high-density drive on your machine?

 Okay, if you want one, universal, do-all VGAing, mutli-synching
compostiting tube, just get the Mitsubishi Diamond Scan. You
can even feed it NTSC video via it's composite input.
