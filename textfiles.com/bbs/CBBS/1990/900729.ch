Msg 43852 is 08 line(s) on 07/28/90 from BILL WOLFF
to JIM POLOUS re: R/WYSE 3216 RAM CHIP ERROR

I don't know what that error means. But if you are good with changing chips
I suggest you do so. Then the message should change the number when you
switch the correct RAM.

If you were running a Commodore 8-bit computer, I would suggest to POKE
or FETCH the RAM to find it. But CP/M and MS-DOS works poorly with BASIC.
That is very unfortunate. Since almost everyone has BASIC to work with.
