to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/SMALL PC?

 I agree an old XT would be the cheapest. I can get a 1M 7.2MHz mother
board from Bullet for $179, add power supply, case, and keyboatr, and I'd
have it - but it would be a boring system. I'm looking for something
more "interesting". ;-)

Msg 43226 is 06 line(s) on 02/16/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JIM PRICE re: R/XMODEM

 The original specs for the modem (aka xmodem) protocol is on the
Ward Board CBBS in the "low numbered" messages. try (708) 849-1132.
 For zmodem etc, I don't know where to go - if I needed it I'd check out
the PC Communications forum on Compuserve.
 You might ask on Prodigy, also, but of course you can't download anything
there either!

 Thanks, but I don't do that much printing - I tend to go in spurts,
such as when I am working on a particular project. I've probably only
printed a few pages in the last couple weeks.
 I'd love to try it, but in fairness to you and the project, I really
have to say no for lack of time.
 The smearing doesn't bother me, heh heh.

 Don't forget, the pizza party for CBBS' 12th anniversary is Saturday
2/17 at Barnaby's Pizza, 2xxx W Touhy (near California) - about 3 miles
east of the Edens X-way (North out of downtown Chicago)
 Begins at 2:00; many of us will be @ Elek Tek (6557 N. Lincoln if my
memory serves me) perhaps 12:30 or 1:00 or so. (at least tentatively,
that's the plan). Unfortunately they don't have any T1000SE or XE's in
stock ;-)

Msg 43229 is 08 line(s) on 02/17/90 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/YOUR WP PROBLEM

Eric:
 Thanks for relaying that msg. I appreciate th info. However,
I've tried all that; the problem is MUCH stickier than that. It
appears that it will require a TSR that remaps video RAM to other
system addresses, and constantly routes memory writes to new
location-however, I think that this would drastically slow down the
system. We'll see what happens if I ever get around to trying to
write such a thing!

about anything else

ward the drive draws 8 watts nominally max is 28 watts

Msg 43234 is 03 line(s) on 02/17/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to COLIN SCHROEDER re: R/YOUR WP PROBLEM

You can't just reroute video writes with a TSR. You'd need something that
can use the 386's mapping registers (you might look into QEMM or 386-to-
the-max).

Msg 43235 is 16 line(s) on 02/18/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to BILL WOLFF re: R/SMALL PC?

A boring XT? well, I haven't really figured it out, but something like this:
 $ 40 case
 $ 60 Power Supply
 $180 Bullet 7.2MHz 286 motherboard with 8 slots & 1M memory
 $ 80 Floppy controller w/serial/parallel/clock
 $ 70 360K floppy
 $ 60 Keyboard
 $ 80 Dos
 $ 55 Color card w/printer & composite output (use w/old CBBS monitor)
 $340 3.5" 32M drive & controller
 -
 $965 total
 I already have the modem and monitor, so unless I missed something, the
above should do it. This is primarily prices from JDR MicroDevices. I
could do cheaper with their motherboard, but I like the bullet, and it
supplies a nice 384K disk cache "free".

Msg 43236 is 05 line(s) on 02/18/90 from JIM REDMAN
to COLIN SCHROEDER re: R/1M SIMM BUYING GROUP

Apologies for not replying in so long. Is that a 9600 fax or 4800,
seems that a 9600 would be the only one worth getting. The board,
the flyer for which I've lost claimed to be a 4800 MNP modem, as well
as a 9600 fax, but I know nothing about the compatibility of a 4800
baud modem.

Msg 43237 is 10 line(s) on 02/18/90 from JIM REDMAN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/SMALL PC?

There is an industrial PC, I think that it is called the "Baby Blue",
comes in a steel case with four screw hole flanges so that you could
bolt it to a piece of plywood, as normal. It has one 720K floppy,
or EEPROM memory ( or a hard disk ), BUT I'm not sure that it comes
with a slot. It is about the size of a half height floppy. It has
one, or two serial ports, a video port (TTL I think) and a keyboard
port on the outside. Comes in two vesions as I remember, one is
a 10MHz XT (~$1000?) or 20MHz 386 (~$ugh). I'll try and drag up the
literature on it, it's interesting, even if not what you want for your
application.
