to DALE WALSH re: PROTOCOLS

 Sorry, I had to delete your msg since you weren't able to contain your
frustration sufficiently to keep from swearing.
 The only info I have is on the Ward Board, (312) 849-1132, in the low
numbered msgs. It is what has been there for quite a few years. There
is no file access here or there. Your search for "1,modem" didn't work
here because there has never been any protocol documentation here.
 Here's the list of protocol documentation I was able to find on Compuserve:
BPROTO.NFO 20 58 Differences between XMODEM, etc and "B" protocols
DSZ .ARC 86B 59 External Zmodem protocol module
RELAX .THD 8 N6 Oct 86: explanation of "relaxed" XMODEM
RZ .EXE 21B 86 MS-DOS version of RZ from UNIX (ZMODEM receive)
RZSZ .ARC 94B 59 VMS + Unix Zmodem protocol file xfer programs
SZ .EXE 20B 86 MS-DOS version of SZ from UNIX (ZMODEM send)
TCRC .C 6 26 C source to implement XMODEM with CRC for PASCAL or BASIC
UPDCRC.PAS 2 56 Turbo Pascal INClude file to add CRC Xmodem protocol to pgm
WXMODE.ARC 25B 66 Description of Xmodem, CRC Xmodem, error recovery, WXmodem
XMODEM.DOC 26 96 Description of XMODEM protocol as implemented on CIS
XMODEM.EXP 11 25 Description of XMODEM protocol in general
YZMODM.ARC 86B O7 Official YMODEM and ZMODEM protocol descriptions
 Hopefully you or a friend are on Compuserve, or, given these names (which
are truncated to CIS 6-char filenames) you can find what you're looking for.
 Good luck. Calm down. Count to 10.

to JIM POLOUS re: R/IBM PS/2 PROBLEM

 I haven't memorized the various error msgs, but the system is smart enough
that if something is wrong, the only thing it will boot is the ref disk.
 I'm surprised it boots the hard disk - but if you say it won't boot a
floppy, I must conclude you're probably trying to boot a DOS disk or
something - other than a ref disk.
 Of the 3 common errors, 162, 163, and 165, I don't remember which one
means which, but (I guess you could call this a multiple choice quiz with
no known answer) the 3 mean:
 - clock bad
 - memory configuration change{
 - unrecognized adapter.
 Also, you should get a 162 if you have an external drive but it is
powered off - the system is checking the config and is unable to communicate
with the external drive so the 162 comes up. This is certainly the most
common 162 error.

to ALL re: MICRO HELP TOOLBOX HELP

I have purchased Micro help toolbox for use with Quick Basic.
I have having a hard time trying to get it to accept changes
thet I have made to the MHDEF.INC include file. I have tried
looking for a OBJ of MAK file that may be causing this problem
but as of yet I have found nothing. I have verified that the changes
are happening to the inc file but they aren't reflected during
internal or external compile and link. I have to be missing something.
The file that I am trying to change only effects the key detected.
I've tried just about everything.

Msg 43077 is 21 line(s) on 01/23/90 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to MARTIN SCHRADER re: R/DISK MANGLER & BIG DRIVES

I'd be very interested to hear what sort of problems you're running
into with DM, since I've run it on two different systems, with very
different hardware! The first was an ALR 386/16 with ALR mother-
board, Phoenix BIOS, and 42 Mb Miniscribe MFM drive (C: = 1 Mb,
D: = 41 Mb). The second is an Everex OEM (Spear) 386/25 with AMI
motherboard/BIOS, and 130 Mb Miniscribe ESDI drive and Adaptec ctrlr
(C: = 1 Mb, D: = 129 Mb). I have had no problems, and I run a wide
variety of software.
 I certainly don't intend this as a plug for Ontrack! I'd just
like some info on what sort of things to look out for! Part of the
reason is that I've talked to three different people who have had
problems with serious data errors when writing large DOS files to
ESDI disks when using an Adaptec 2322-B ctrlr and 100+ Mb disk.
As far as I know, none of these cases involved DM, but I'm using
that same ctrlr, and am getting a bit worried. (SEE next msg for
more) Any further info you have would be appreciated-especially
since my boss crashed his harddisk when trying to run the PC-Labs
DOS File Access-Large Record benchmark (using the Adaptec ctrlr
w/ 150 Mb disk!)

Thanks in advance! Colin

Msg 43078 is 25 line(s) on 01/23/90 from COLIN SCHROEDER
to ALL re: DATA ERRORS W/ BIG DISKS

Hi All!
 I've run into several very similar cases of serious disk/ctrlr
errors recently, with people who are using the same Adaptec ESDI
controller with 100+ Mb disks. Two customers who I've talked to,
as well as my boss and myself, use the Adaptec 2322-B ESDI ctrlr
with large ESDI disks. The two customers I've talked to experienced
serious corruption of large (600K+) data files when they were written
to disk using standard DOS I/O functions. Both were using 150 Mb
ESDI disks; one a CDC Wren III, the other probably the same. My boss
crashed his disk irreparably while trying to run the PC-Labs DOS
File Access-Large Record benchmark with a similar configuration, and
had to replace the disk!
 I use the same controller, but with a MiniScribe 130 Mb ESDI disk,
formatted with DiskManager, and have had no problem, even when I tried
to replicate the above problems with a 1 Mb data file! Haven't tried
it without DiskManager-and all other cases happened (I think) under
standard DOS 3.3 formatting.
 One person I talked to said he seemed to recall reading a report
that certain batches of the Adaptec 2322-B had a problematic data
verification chip, and that this was fixed at some point. Anyone
hear/recall where I might find more info?? Or do you have other
ideas as to the cause??
 Any help would be much appreciated!

Colin

to ALL re: HELP WITH STARLINK

 Hi, I was wondering if anyone had the number/info for the STATLINK
(STARLINK that is) service. Thier old number at 800-343-7304 went out
of service a long time ago but I'm still seeing BBS's giving out thier
starlink address. I cancelled my PCPURSUIT a few months back and
figured this would be the way to go, now i can't find info on it
anywhere. Thanks.

it won't even boot the reference disk.
