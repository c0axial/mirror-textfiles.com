to DAVE TRAUB re: R/IBM PC CONVERABLE

  One of the reasons the convertible was selling so cheap, is that IBM
stopped making accessories for it a couple years ago.  You can't get parts,
to the best of my knowledge.

Msg 44199 is 03 line(s) on 11/25/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to DAVE SCHUEMAN re: Z-100 FOR SALE

  Instead of trying to fit everything into an unreadable subject and
leaving the message empty, how about starting over, subject something
like "Z-100 for sale", then listing the items it includes.  Thanks.

Msg 44200 is 07 line(s) on 11/26/90 from BILL WOLFF
to TONY ANTONUCCI re: R/HAYES MANUAL

Hi Tony! Thanks for looking and digging up the address for HAYES. It is very
much appreciated. Oh... no I have the standard AT command set, as I have many
other modems as well. Thanks anyway. I am interested in the manuals for
both the HAYES 1200 and HAYES 2400 because the manuals always has something
that you don't know about. At least I am hoping to learn something from
them. If I can't find any, I'll write to HAYES and try to get them. You
have been very helpful, thanks! I hope I can return the favor someday. <BW>

to JERRY OLSEN re: R/MODEM MANUAL

Hi Jerry! If you like, I can drop by and pick it up if that would help.
Hows the parking there? <BW>
