]I am calling from California to find out if there are any computer
newspapers/magazines that serve the Chicago area.  Most major cities,
such as Chicago, have some kind of publication that serves the local
computerist.  The reason I want to know this is because I am planning
on marketing a product and would like to advertise it locally.  Do

to BILL COLEMAN re: R/FOXPRO VS PARADOX

  Ok, I see.  Such an application doesn't sound too hard "to me", but
then again, I've seen people program custom programs for WEEKS in Fox.
(not that I've seen anything where you can "easily" generate multi-file
applications).
  If you want to spend a little time with it every night or so, asking
away here for ideas, feel free to do it.

to BILL COLEMAN re: YOUR DATABASE QUESTION

I have most of the database products which you (and others) mentioned.
For the application which you described, I would choose Paradox (3.0)
or Clarion.  Both of these have the capability to link 2 files in
the standard manner(s).  They are totally different in their approach
to development, however.  Clarion leads you to somewhat of a finished
product, with maintenance screens, choice lists, etc., while Paradox (3.0)
can relate 2 tables exquisitely, but the gingerbread must be programmed
in their powerful (but non-trivial) application languages ("PAL").

If I had to get something done tomorrow, I'd use Paradox.  On the other
hand, if I were concerned about the user's impressions, I'd use Clarion.
dBase and the clones are best suited for involved (but laborious)
programming.  That's not to say that you can't program Clarion or Paradox,
but you will have to start from scratch with either one, to learn
their peculiar application languages.  They are both fine, but
quite different.
