Only a couple of days ago, I saw numerous messages which added up to
one very nice (seemingly) BBS list, starting about message 42565.

to ALL re: MICROBYTES!

What is MicroBytes? MicroBytes is a electronic magazine that is published
weekly and contains the latest in IBM, MS-DOS, and Apple systems. Get the
scoop on the hardware and software before most magazines can get it in
print.

One thing I should note! MicroBytes is only distributed through licensed
on-line services and you must pay a yearly high fee. Well the SYSOP on "The
Round Table" (312-777-9480) is kind enough to flip for the bill for
MicroBytes and so it doesn't cost it's members anything except a call. So
call today and get validated! Don't wait and lose one more week of
MicroBytes!

Enjoy! <BW>

Msg 43099 is 10 line(s) on 01/28/90 from JIM SACKETT
to ALL re: DOUBLE ECHO W/PROCOMM

I have recently upgraded to a multi sync and vga card. I have noticed that
when I call a BBS with Procomm or Procomm+ I get a double echo.
This occurs when I reach the 25th line and every line there after.
Is there a way to eliminate this anomily besides maybe setting the
 video default mode via the video card software before using Procomm?
 Is there a new version of Procomm that handles this? Does Qmodem have
 the same problem? I have a copy of Qmodem but haven't tries it yet.
 I have used it wmy old monitor but I prefer to use Procomm.
 Thanks for your help

Ward,
 I downloaded you FIXPAR.THD from CIS and just wondered why you
suggested a novice use Norton's Hex Mode Editor to perform the ZAP as
opposed to using the formatted partition editor (F6 I think) of the same
utility. Not being critical just curious (inquiring minds!).
Thanks,

It was nice to get the network working, but I still have some questio
I can not get answered by my supposed support staff from ibm.
I don't know how to name the printers for use on the network.
I have been told I have to name them so they can be called from any termi
I just don't know how to identify each printer.
Can you help? I have read the Iclass manual, but could not find any infor-
mation.
By the way, I did recieve a copy of LinkWay form Arlene (Ithink that
is her name) the saleslady.
It looks to be useful.
Thanks in advance.

Msg 43107 is 30 line(s) on 01/30/90 from JIM POLOUS
to BRENT JONES re: CLIPPER

We have just begun to look at Clipper. We have purchased the Summer '87
version (believe it or not, it is currently the most recent version).
Anyway, registered users of Summer'87 will automatically get the
latest version (Version 5.0) when it is released sometime this quarter.
Although I have read the{book a little and some additional books,
and I haven't really done much in it, I've noticed a few things. First,
Clipper is written in Microsoft C and it is interfaceable to Turbo C
and Microsoft C and I would imagine assembler and Pascal as w{ell.
I did find two things about it that are unusual. First, we run a Novell
Access server on our network, this runs under a special version of
Quarterdeck's multitasking environment, Desqview. Clipper apparently
polls the keyboard directly, so when I ran the program on the access
server from remote, it appeared to lock up. Not really true, when I
hung up, it reset fine. Also, the EXE files (and it does create EXE files)
are H-U-G-E. I wrote a test program that displayed a message,
"HELLO I AM A CLIPPER PROGRAM". It was in excess of 145K I wonder if
there is a way to strip all of the unused code, because I can't see that
there would be a reason for 145K to print one line. When integrating it
into C, you are not able to use, scanf, printf, fscanf or anything
with 'scanf' in it. They recommend that all screen/keyboard i/o be done
through Clipper, but putch and getch seem to work fine. Also, when linking
Turbo C, in with Clipper you have to include the C library for the memory
model that you're working with and it may take some fidgiting around
with parameters in Turbo C. All clipper functions appear to be in
upper case, pass parameters in the Pascal fashion and cannot pass
parameters to C functions in the normal way. You have to call a function
to get the parameters. According to a blurb in one of the magazines
Clipper 5.0 will be database independent. This is great for us because
we are using a lot of Paradox 3.0 tables because of the abilwM3f*ity
to do on demand querying.Call my bbs:708/4220527 & Start a Clipper disc.

to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/QB HELP

 Was talking about a plain matrix. I think I can get away with a two
dimension array and play with that. It seems like it would be
shorter code.

Msg 43109 is 09 line(s) on 01/30/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to JIM POLOUS re: R/CLIPPER

The large size of .EXE files is due to the inclusion of a run-time engine
(not just library routines). Because of things like macro evaluation,
some of the code has to be semi-interpreted even after it's compiled.
It's a bit of a bear to live with, but fortunately the EXE size doesn't
increase all that drastically once you get over that initial hurdle.
As far as I can tell, compiled programs access the keyboard with BIOS
int 16H rather than directly trapping the hardware interrupt, so most
key macro programs and the like should work with it (though programs
that force keys in at the DOS (int 21h) level probably won't work).
