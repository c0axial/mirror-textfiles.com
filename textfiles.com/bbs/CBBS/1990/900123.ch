]I'm trying to get some information, I'm pissed off, not at
you, but at the lack of availability of stuff which is supposed to
be available, If you have any, please call me, this is not a crank,
I really need information and in 2 months I've found none.
My number is (613) 230-6918, any time after 10:00 pm, I work
early evening and I'm up till 4:00am.

It amazes me how angry a person can become when he's told that
there's all kinds of files out there, and when he looks f*he can't
find one !!! I read a message someone upload me localy which "Morgan
Davis" stats that there is an abundance of information all over, well,
to hell with who-ever he is cause I can't find one file, even your
system can't find one, I tried the "S" "1,modem" and it gave me nothing.
I preffer the old method of being prompted for tagging and
auto-retreival when the search is completed. Not giving you shit,
just letting off a little steam, guess I've chewed on your ear long
enough, I hope you, or you convince someone to call me, I'd feel much
better about all this.


Dale Walsh.
If you try to verify the number by "1-613-555-1212" you will
be told that the number is a non published number. My address is
2-205 Charlotte Ave. Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K17

I would preffer a call though, I need the information now and
will absorb the cost of long distance charges to achieve this.

]Guess that makes this my 11th year of calling CBBS !!!
I first called with an Apple II (not a plus) at 110 baud in 1979
I think I might have had 16K RAM in the machine by then....talk like
this should be saved for the Pizza party. I should be able to make
it...as my body is healing well after the plane crash in July. See
ya !

to DENNIS DUFFNER re: R/EXT. DRIVE

 Turned out to be a lack of "twist" in the I/O cable! Pins 10-16
have to be reversed. (DAMN IBM for @#$%ing with manufacturer's drive
addressing!)
 10 is something like "motor select A", while 16 is "motor select B",
then 12 and 14 are the drive select pins, so apparently pins 10 and 12
are "hot" for "the" drive, so to get the "other" drive, you need to
pick up those signals from 16 and 14. Gak.
 I probably still need a terminator. Now that the drive is working,
it gets read errors on diskettes that are OK on other machine, but then
again it seems to read some diskettes OK.
 Tnx for the comments.

 (Please, don't call me SYSOP! Please don't call my Cheerios "Cereal" ;-)
 I guess I don't catch the idea - an '83 book saying this is the CBBS
H/Q isn't inconsistent with our celebrating our 12th anniversary.
 CBBS was the first micro BBS, and was put up in Feb '78.

to ALL re: MODEM PROTOCOLS

 I am trying to get as much information as I can regarding protocols
 If you have information, such as application bulletins on Xmodem,
Xmodem1k, Xmodem4k, Ymodem, Ymodem-G, Zmodem please call me. I am at a
point that I would drive over to your homes to get any information I can
 Since most of this information is supposed to be available to on most
BBS's I become pissed off trying to locate such. If you read this and
you have ANY, please call me collect, I just want information, it'll cost you
nothing to call so please, don't pass this message, help me out.


 My name is Dale Walsh, I can be reached at (613) 230-6918 after 10:00
pm It's in Ontario, Canada for those questioning the area code

Msg 43070 is 13 line(s) on 01/23/90 from JIM POLOUS
to ALL re: IBM PS/2 PROBLEM

At work here, I have an IBM PS/2 Model 80 that is acting as a Novell filf*e
file server. Since we moved the server two floors down a couple of months
ago, it began giving us an error 162 after the POST. The time was right as
was the memory in the system, so I assumed the CMOS was okay. (You know what
they say about ASS-U-ME.) Our server went down for the umpteenth time so
I decieded to come in early, down the server and reconfigure Netware.
Businessland left a driver loaded for a SCSI drive that didn't work
properly and wasn't Novell certified (but that's another story)]+~
Anyway, when the error 162 came up we thought nothing of it - we
had a stuck key on the keyboard for a long time and had always gotten
an error. Anyway, the computer won't boot from a floppy.f*. Only the
hard disk, but that is no help as it loads the Novell Cold Boot Loader
If anyone has any information they can provide call me at 312-269-1186.
