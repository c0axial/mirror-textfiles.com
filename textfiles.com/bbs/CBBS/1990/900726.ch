 Just happened to see your mention that you listen to Michael Feldman on
Saturday mornings. Have you seen the TV show on WGN on Sunday evenings?
I watched once, and it was so bad I was embarassed. Some things are better
on the radio, I guess.

to CLIFF SHARP re: R/ACCESSING DOS SUBDIRS

Thx for the reply. I was "afraid" of that. Before jumping into it,
though, I preferred to field alternative ideas.BTW, your thought
about using CHMOD was something I looked into. No go.DOS protected
its rear end on that one. :-)
