I understand that. We had a similar problem with a company that recently
went under, Wells American in West Columbia, South Carolina. We ordered one
of their CompuStar 2000 386 machines with a convertible bus. Supposedly it
was supposed to have ISA, EISA, and MCA buss expansion boxes available
for it. We wanted to use it as a backup for our PS/2 file server, but
as luck would have it, it didn't have it built in, the "MCA expansion
unit was forever on backorder" and they used proprietary disk drive
holders (they didn't use rails, rather they used a plate which screwed
on to the bottom of a 1/4th height - yes it was 1/4th height 5.25" disk
drive. These parts could not be purchased anywhere. And although a national
company serviced the machines and could get the parts, they could not sell
them to the end user. When I called up and requested one, they sent me
the front cover to a 3.5" disk drive and some screws that fit absolutely
nothing on the computer. I finally send the computer back and a very
nasty letter on company stationary telling them that we cannot deal with
any companies that treat corporate customers in that way. I send it back.
We had no more problems as we were not even invoiced at the time.
We now have a very reputable and friendly "account executive" (salesman)
from M.I.S. Computers. We get over 80% of our hardware and software from
him. His name is Guy Gross and the company's phone is 312-772-1200.
He really goes out of his way for customer service.

Msg 43430 is 08 line(s) on 04/02/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: FIFO UART?

 What's this fifo uart (the one with 16 char built-in buffer)?
 When I run 9600 baud into CBBS or Chinet, I lose characters due to
my cache. I can't do anything about the cache - it is tied to my
unique motherboard (Bullet).
 I'm thinking that if my serial port uses a standard uart, and that if
it is the one that is available in replacement form, that might solve
my problems.
 Thanks for any ideas!

Msg 43431 is 08 line(s) on 04/02/90 from CLIFF SHARP
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/FIFO UART?

 Look into the NS16550 chip. It's supposed to be a plug-in replacement
for the 8250 and 16450 (although I seem to remember reading one BBS
message once that said you had to pull a pin or something, I can't find
any evidence of such a thing any more). The FIFO only works when the
software driving the chip knows it's there and knows how to program it,
but more and more stuff these days can handle it. I'm reasonably sure
your Pro-YAM has the smarts to do it, as Forsberg's stuff seems to in
general.

Msg 43432 is 08 line(s) on 04/02/90 from CLIFF SHARP
to ALL re: NEED SMALL BUD SPEEDY HD

 In the next few days I'll have a few bucks and will be able to get
a new hard drive. I'm looking for something that's not too big, but is
as fast as I can afford; figure less than $500-600. Currently using
a WD1003 controller (MFM, 2:1, ST506), so include cost of controller if
it's RLL or IDE or otherwise won't work with the WD1003.
 Best I've found so far is a 65 MB Mitsubishi, 23 ms, at $359. Don't
know if that needs a different controller. Can anyone offer a better
suggestion?

Msg 43433 is 03 line(s) on 04/02/90 from CLIFF SHARP
to ALL re: MITSUBISHI DRIVES ?

 Anyone have any comments, good OR bad, about Mitsubishi drives?
Specifically, I'm eyeing a 65 MB, 23 ms drive of theirs that's selling
mail-order at $359.

to ALL re: ANYBODY KNOW AMOS?

I have a client who has been using an Alpha Micro point of sale
terminal system with AMOS (Alpha Micro OS). Anybody local here
know to be able to intelligently consult with respect to same?
They were working with someone in Florida who set this up down
there and then handed them off to someone in Jersey (New not old),
and would like to talk to someone independent of the operation
before expanding and adding to it.

Best response to me days 312-726-3555 (Chicago). Thanks.
