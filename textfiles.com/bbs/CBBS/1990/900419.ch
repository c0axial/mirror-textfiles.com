]__I'm back.  Pop has been moved to a "home" for therapy, but there's not
much therapy, and he's in a lot of pain.  It is going to be a long time.
__I'll have to be going to visit quite often.

to JOHN BARGAR re: R/SUPPORT FOR CP/M+

 No, there's not much here about CP/M any more, sorry. This never was a
DL system - not sure why it would be listed in a "how to get free software"
book!
 But if you've got questions you might ask anyway - there are some folks
still around into CP/M, and/or some who could steer you toward other BBSs
catering to CP/M.

to KEVIN MCGUIGAN re: R/WARD WESTERN UNION

 Boy, that's an old item on my to-do list - I don't have it here at home,
not sure what the latest way - I think I had been given a contact name at
W.U. for them to tell me the details of what it required.
 Needless to say a parallel printer can't work - but there's a feature
to add serial to a ProPrinter - what model was it, do you know?

to ALL re: 386 SUPERCHIP?

I have heard all sorts of things about 386 pin compatable, but faster,
replacements? Any info out there? Do they work?

Msg 43491 is 24 line(s) on 04/19/90 from JEFF ARDIS
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: MARSHALL PRESNELL

WARD

 Thanks for the help anyway. One more question - ever heard of a B
software package called PIPELINE? If you have, that might help me track down
the guy I'm looking for.

 Did you write XMODEM? If not, who did?

What's your background - I mean, how did you get into this business and what
do you do for a living, if you don't mind telling me.

 I'll be back on soon - voice is (202) 885-6585 if you want to chat. What
are you intending as the purpose of your board? I've been "off the air" for
about four years. When I had more time to use the modem, most of the stuff
around were crackers hangouts, underground systems, etc. The past few days
I've been going through my massive file of old numbers, and most of them
are disconnected or are people who haven't appreciated being woken up
at two in the morning! But, yours is one of the few that is still active.
Can you give me a bit of the history of this board - software, the people
behind it, etc.?

 Got to run. Back on soon I hope.

They bought all Apples Lisa's and have sold them and have developed
products to allow them to run a wide variety of Mac software.
