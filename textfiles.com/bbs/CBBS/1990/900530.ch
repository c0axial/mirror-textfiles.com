Help! I'm a new user. I own a new modem. I don't know who to call.
Specifically, I'm looking for BBS that are aimed or have to do with
writers, screenwriters, editors, agents, etc., (Any literati gig would
do for now) If unknown, can you help point me in the right direction?
Much appreciated and thanks
Dario Fagnani in Chicago, Illinois.

Msg 43646 is 03 line(s) on 05/27/90 from PHIL JERN
to DARIO FAGNANI re: R/SCREENWRITER NEEDS HELP!

Dario:
I would suggest the Wordprocessing BBS in Evanston at (708) 491-6995.
It is run by Henry Kisor, of the Chicago Sun-Times.

Msg 43647 is 06 line(s) on 05/27/90 from ALEX ZELL
to ALL re: R/SCREENWRITER

Henry Kisor's BBS, with emphasis on word processing, is a private
system. To gain access, one must send a letter to Henry Kisor,
Book Editor, Chicago Sun-Times, 410 N Wabash Av., requesting
validation. Henry sends login name and password by mail.
The board is highly restricted. It is also his only means of
communication between office and home. He is deaf.

to ED FOSTER re: R/QEMM OR ? MEM RELIEF?

Thanks for the reply. I'mlooking hard at the POWERVEISA machine. Can
you recommend any good dealers who can provide a decent discount,
or might throw inan operating system or utilities or whatever for a
better deal? Sorry about my typing. Who have you dealt with? Where did
the original owner get your machine? Questions.questions.Regards.

Msg 43649 is 19 line(s) on 05/28/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to JIM FLANAGAN re: R/SIMPLE CP/M WORD PROCESSOR

As a sysop, I get TOO many requests for files by mail, so my BBS has set
up a policy to weed out serious from casual interest. Essentially, any
reasonable donation can be sent, accompanied by 1) the file(s) desired
(up to a max. of one disk of files per request); 2) a disk formatted for
the desired machine; and 3) (of course) the format of that disk so I'll
know what drive settings to use. All must be submitted together. If
interested, mail to: The Advocate BBS, 899 S. Plymouth Ct., Suite 504,
Chicago 60605. (Note: It's ALMOST certain we'll be moving on or about
15 June, so if the package might not arrive by that date, call the BBS
first to confirm the correct address.).As another alternative, call
the BBS itself to see if someone else who doesn't receive such a
continual deluge of requests can offer to supply the files without a
donation request. In fact, I'd be grateful if they could do so. :-)
(Callers over our way usually go out of their way to help each other.)
Oh, while calling you should track down the exact filenames. (Typing
GO WRITING and perhaps GO NEW should be good places to start.) I'm
glad to offer our "disks by mail" option, but I can't offer the time
to do the filename search that callers can do equally as well themselves.

Msg 43650 is 12 line(s) on 05/28/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to BILL MATTSON re: R/4 SALE

Hi, Bill.Noticed a msg of yours re S-100s, though I didn't notice the
msg to which you were replying. So this is a bit of a long shot.As
you probably know, The Advocate is ALMOST certainly going to be moving
in mid-June. It had an S-100 donated to it which we'll PROBABLY sell for
any reasonable donation (tax deduction possible). If that fits into your
interests, give a holler over my way before long.

BTW, we don't expect any interruption in BBS services during the
move. We have two nearly identical set-ups and I expect to have them both
capable of answering at the moment they switch the line. Probably will
have to port a msg or three over by hand, but all in all it should be
a relatively smooth transition (for the BBS, if not for us!).

Thanks for all your help. It looks like Kisor's thing is it.
I'll get back and tell how it goes.

Msg 43652 is 14 line(s) on 05/29/90 from GARRETT DERNER
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/HAVE CLIPPER/ WILL DEVELOP

Do you mean a CLIPPER prog must explicitly name the drive it is writing
to?
In case it helps shed any light, I also had prob with Clipper progs under
DOS 4. I had linked in a module written in C that created some files; I
found that DOS 4 got confused and wrote data to the screen and not to the
files. It was with DOS 4 _only_, and I checked to make sure I was not
overwriting any buffers or file handles. I finally stumbled onto a
workaround: make sure any and all *deletions* of files occur at the _end_
of the prog. DOS 4 was only confused when the program tried to create
files after deleting other files.
P. Polakoff on CIS NanForum thought it might have to do with the CACHEing
that a PS/2 does under DOS 4. He suggested checking the MicroSoft forum
for workarounds-I didn't get around to doing that; maybe I would find a
more satisfactory workaround if I would.
