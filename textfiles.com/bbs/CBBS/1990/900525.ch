 >Assuming you don't have to access the 3270 board with your FoxBase programs
Sorry - that's what it's all about - I wrote an assembler API that you
LOAD in FoxBase, then you can fully interact with the host application from
within a FoxBase application.
 We seem to have found a smaller terminal emulator, but QEMM is still
important. We need "everything at once" - like someone with 5 favorite
TSRs, but who can't use DesqView because they DO need all 5 in the same
"partition".
 I prolly should try DV for myself - but when I did, it took too much
time trying to figure what could run where. I wound up with the more
simple Software Carousel.

 I'm game for some stuff. possibly. (312) 775-2593
early eves. Right now I am looking for a lot of GOOD colored
disks (360K). Could use a cheap wide printer etc.

 I bought the ALR 386/2 used about a year ago, meaning that someone else
had done the initial debugging (if any) for me. Since then the only trouble
has been a problem with the 08387, which I cured by opening the case and
pushing down on the chip. [Warning: let it cool first.] The machine runs
all the time, except when there is a thunderstorm I can hear in the basement,
and when it is traveling to a factory.

 Well, do you >>really<< need everything at once? For example, if
your API interacts directly with the emulator board, you don't need to
have its driver in the same window. No? Didn't think so.
 OK, let's assume that compiling will reduce the memory requirements.
Run your editor and compiler in another window, then switch back to
the window with all the TSRs for execution. I have been doing that
with QuickBASIC this week. (Actually, I edit with KEDIT on a separate
machine with color monitor, save to the disk in the 386, compile in one
window, then switch to the execution window and run it while I'm still
looking at the area of the source I just changed.)
 One more thing: if you don't need the network to test, just boot from
the local hard disk and save whatever memory the network interface uses.
 What the heck does this program do, anyway?
