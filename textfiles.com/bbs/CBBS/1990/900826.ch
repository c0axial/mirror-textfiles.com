to BENJAMIN COHEN re: R/1200 BPS PROBLEMS

Most BBS's which sports faster bauds then just 1200, has what is called
an autosync circuit. The problem is, 1200 baud and under lacks this
feature, so you may get garbage characters. CrossTalk across the phone
line makes this harder for the 1200 baud modem. Only cure is to buy a higher
speed modem or drop down to 300 baud. Sorry! <BW>

I have a 1200 baud BSR modem for sale. It has a volumn control for the
speaker and a help menu for those AT commands. And that's not all, a real
clock to play with. So how much is all this worth to you?

Wait ther is more. This modem will even redial for you while your not in
your communications program and doing some real work and waiting for your
favorite BBS is become unbusy! What is all this worth to you?

Well I am in a hurry, so make an offer! <BW>
