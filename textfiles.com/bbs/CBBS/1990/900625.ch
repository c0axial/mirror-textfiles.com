Tony - The best way to get the utilities to me is to mail diskettes to:
Marty Dippel
3622 N. Bernard
Chicago, IL 60618

This is probably easier than meeting at some prearranged
place, although that would work fine as well. I'm glad to receive these
utils from you and of course any help I can offer you in the form of
constructive criticism will be gladly given. If there's anything else I
can do for you, just holler! -Thanks!

to ALL re: COPY '*' PROB ??

I think I have found a bug with the COPY command under DOS 3.3x.
We have several daily files called FILxx.DAY that we copy into a weekly
file called WEEK.DAY. The command is COPY FIL*.DAY WEEK.DAY
The file content has nothing to do with the bug - as we can duplicate
the probelm but just copying more than 2 of any text type files.
Anyway - all the files are listed as the COPY command executes.
However, ONLY the 1st two files are actually copied to the output file.
I have tested this on Compaq DOS 3.31 and Toshiba (laptop) DOS 3.30
The killer is - it works just fine on DOS 3.10.

In 43718 you ask if I think the operator of the Feminist BBS
would like you and jcs and others to call. Of course
she would, as long as they observed reasonable guidelines for
intelligent discourse. If you are asking if the usual crapola
and drift masquerading as humor which some of the people you
mention employ to derail conversational threads on chinet
is acceptable - well, I doubt that would be welcomed by any of
the users. If you are asking about social/philosophical/political
viewpoints, the users (and sometimes combatants) on Feminist BBS
are as diverse as they are on chinet.

 Anyone have details on the layout and contents of the DOS partition
table, as created by FDISK et al? This is one bit of info I've never
ever ever seen.

to ALL re: HARD DRIVE WOES

IN MY PS2 MODEL 30-286, I HAVE A 42.5 MEG SEAGATE HARD DRIVE (INSTEAD OF
THE DINKY STOCK IBM TYPES). IT WORKS OKAY, BUT I SOMETIMES GET THE
MESSAGE ON SCREEN: "non-system or disk error-hit any key when ready."
WHEN THIS HAPPENS, MY DRIVE GOES TOTALLY SILENT ON ME (ALL I COULD HEAR
WOULD BE THE COOLING FAN). IF I TRY TO DO A WARM REBOOT, I WOULD GET A
1701-20 ERROR MESSAGE. IF I SHUT OFF THE COMPUTER AND WAIT 15 SECONDS
BEFORE POWERING UP, THINGS ARE BACK TO NORMAL.

MY QUESTION IS: IS THIS NORMAL, OR DO I HAVE ANY REASON TO WORRY?
