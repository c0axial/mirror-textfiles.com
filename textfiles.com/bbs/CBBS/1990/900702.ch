to JOHN SERRANO re: R/HARD DRIVE WOES

 You can test for the bad contact by switching slots - at least that
would help if the bad contact is in the BUS, not the adapter card.
 MicroWay: Those the '87 people? (i.e. the ones with the various
80x87 chips, the Weitek, etc? Ya, I think they're pretty good.
 But before I'd go sticking much money into an accelerator, I'd check
out a "new" system. Atter all, putting a major CPU change into a
machine makes it "non-IBM" so for what ever reasons you bought it, they
no longer apply. Might as well get a new box ($40), power supply ($150),
and put the # you'd put into an accelerator and buy a MOTHERBOARD with it.
 P.S. Please turn off caps lock when typing. (CBBS automatically lower-
cases any msg in ALL upper case - but for some strange reason you typed
"MicroWay" in lower case just like that, while everything else was
upper-case. Just looks nicer; also is more readable.

to BRENT JONES re: R/GRANDVIEW

 I really like GrandView. The customizability (colors, keyboard,
macros) was nice. Admittedly I don't know the diff from PC Outline,
I just know I didn't want to deal with Brown Bag. I'm still mad at
them for copy-protecting PC-Write and selling it as if it were some-
thing completely different.

Msg 43755 is 08 line(s) on 07/01/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/387 SPEED

 Sure, the '87s are either the same, or the bigger ones are super-sets
of the lower ones. All you have to do is get the right one for your
machine - an 8087 for 8088 or 8086, and 80286 for a 286, and, strangely,
EITHER an 80287 or 80387 for a 386. You said you're running an 80286
and planned an 80387. That won't work, I'm quite sure. The 80387 is
probably a 32 bit bus device.
 What is your application? Do you KNOW that it is HIGHLY dependent
upon floating point ans supports the '87?

 Try John Middleton at (312) 245-2112. While not a petroleum engineer,
he DID work at Arco, and knows a lot of people in the industry. He is
no longer in the industry however.

Msg 43757 is 09 line(s) on 07/01/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to CLIFF SHARP re: R/SUPER VHS RENTALS?

 Heck, just buy the Colorado Jumbo and be done with it. A VCR backup
is a hack at best. With my Colorado, I can browse thru the backups,
hit a key to see a full directory, tag a file to be restored, etc.
 It is only $279, but you'll probably spend a lot - maybe even an equal
amount - on tapes (that's the advantage of the VCR backup).
 I would suspect that the ability to fetch a single file off of a VCR
backup would be VERY time consuming, and I find that 90% of my use
of restore programs is to find a single file (that I clobbered, or
erased, etc).

Msg 43758 is 08 line(s) on 07/01/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JOHN SERRANO re: R/A 4 MEG SIMM?

 Sure. IBM feature 3393 is a 4M simm. I'm working on a memory
configuration paper for IBM, and it is used a LOT in my configs. IBM
sells two cards that take it - a #3077 with 2M standard, and a #3011
with 4M standard - they each take up to 14M (assuming 2M on the
motherboard, standard). They write to sector 2 of the hard disk for
some config info and thus can't be used with Novell Netware, which
starts its programs in sector 2 (vs DOS and OS/2 which start on the
2nd track, wasting the 1st track for just the partition block)

Msg 43759 is 02 line(s) on 07/01/90 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/387 SPEED

 That was an old message reply. I had a 287 and GOT a 387. The
price was right so I jumped at it. I have a 386-20 system.

Msg 43760 is 03 line(s) on 07/01/90 from JOHN SERRANO
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/A 4 MEG SIMM?

I see what you mean about the 4 meg simm. Since my PS/2 has slots for
4 simms, couldn't I just pop four of them there in order to bring my
memory to 16 megabytes (the system maximum)?

Does anyone know of any community colleges in the area that teach a course
on installing and operating a Novell Network?
