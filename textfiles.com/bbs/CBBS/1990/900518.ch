Msg 43579 is 26 line(s) on 05/13/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JOHN SERRANO re: R/PS OUTPUT AT SEL

 Sorry, I don't know. What's a GRC?
 What kind of printer are you talking about? If you're talking a 4216,
then yes, it is Postscript, but you need to address it from Windows via its
"EPT" port. That's how PageMaker does it. Alternatively, you can run the
ppconfig program, pointing to a file of your choice, containing the line:
 standard_print=ascii
i.e. if the file is "ascii.cfg", they you'd type: ppconfig ascii.cfg
 To switch LPT1: to postscript, do the same thing, but have the file,
say, PS.CFG, contain:
 standard_print=postscript
This is all documented in the manual. Not too obvious though.
 If, on the other hand, you have the 4019 printer, (the new "IBM
Laserprinter") then it may or may not be postscript - postscript is an
option, and it is too new for me to have ever seen it.
 There is LaserJet compatibility in both printers - the latest version of
the 4216 includes a clever driver that makes LPT1: be one kind of emulation,
LPT2: be another kind, etc. (i.e. postscript, laserjet, IBM, etc).
 The 4019 does various emulations, and they can be set from the front
panel (push a certain button when powering on, or push a button while
online that would normally only have a function when the on-line light
is off, etc.
 Sorry I didn't reply via UIC - it has been too many years since I called
from home - I don't have the phone # here. I have it somewhere at work,
and should either call more often, or give up my ID (U49213).
 BTW, there's an IBM PROFS/UICVM link, so if the appropriate people are
in the "table" they can send notes back and forth.

 Both ElekTek and Computer Discount Warehouse (where I got mine - the one
on Grand Ave) charge $1749. When you add a 2nd battery, and a case, and
8% Chi/IL tax, you get about 2070.
 Quite happy with it so far - but one battery is quite different from the
other one. One charges, then the charge light turns green, and it is ready.
The other just keeps charging, the voltage DROPPING after it peaks, and the
charge light stays orange. When I get a chance I'll have it replaced.

 Oh, P.S. - I can't figure out how to back the thing up! I tried using
Brooklyn Bridge to the laptop, and backing up from my desktop using a tape,

Who do you know has IMP Overlays for the IMP communication program.
I have been told that Irv Hoff's PRASCA bbs is a membership only
arrangement, and if I called there I wouldn't be able to get into
the files section. I also need the BYE inserts for my TeleVideo and
Altos equipment, and while I could get them through Compuserve, I
don't suscribe, and don't want to. I am thinking of starting the
probalbly last new RCP/M in the Chicago, and would like to be able
to get my hands on this material. Lillipute Node had all of this
stuff, but the guy quit when his suscribers left and he had the
H.D. crash. Now that there are only 4 RCPMs left in the area, I am
getting refered to by people who need help with their stuff, and it
would be a help if I could get a hold of the IMP Overlays.
Thanks if you have any ideas.

to WARD re: NEW UNIX SYSTEM

First, let me say that you have a fantastic system!
Next, with in the next few weeks I will be getting a copy of
Mark Williams Co. Coherent(Unix look-a-like) and I would
like to find out where I can get "C" Pub. Dom. software. If
you could contact me and aid me in my search, I would
deeply apprecaite it.

I'm very interested in hearing all about your adventures with the
COHERENT product. It is inexpensive enough that a few of us might
want to try it out if you think it is a good value. I'd be most
interested in how it installs (quality not method), and how good
you think the documentation is. Also would like to know what the
equipment/memory requirements turn out to be in order to have a
reasonable configuration. Multiuser? Multitasking? Thanks.

 Dial into chinet, Randy Seuss' Public Acces Unix system at
(312) 283-0559.
 He has a lot of C-source on-line.
 If you need access to the net, you'll need "contributor status"
which you can get for $ 50.00 donation.
