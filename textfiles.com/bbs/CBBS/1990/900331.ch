  Just what I wanted, a Clipper programmer! Question..... I use
DOS 4.01 and with a pgm in Clipper I get A SHARE error due to
writing and reading files it makes (small ones). It writes them
to my C drive while the pgm is on D drive.
  I gather it has something to do with checking the current
drive (or NOT checking it). I this just a simple programming
error or a bug with Clipper?

Can anyone tell me how to determine the details of the format of

to work, but how can I figure out how many bytes per sector, # of
sectors, sectors per track, # of tracks, etc.?
I'm not concerned about the details of the equivalents of boot sectors,
FATs, directories, etc. - I just want to be able to access the raw
data on a disk of arbitrary format.

Msg 43411 is 03 line(s) on 03/28/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN

That error usually means that the program is set up for multi-user use
(SET EXCLUSIVE ON, etc.) but the system isn't set up properly.  Do you have
SHARE.EXE loaded?  Is the program using any locking functions?

Nope, haven't found anything very reliable. (You're right: I would have
noted it if I had!)

Rather than muck with such lock-ups, I've occasionally resorted to tricks
like telling another 'puter to pretend it's a printer, redirect the DOS
output to a serial port and hardwire the two. There really <oughta> be
something better!

I don't recall your original msg, but I presume you were looking for a PD
modem program for a Rainbow. I <<think>> a fellow named David Finke found
and installed such a beast for his wife's office. If you want to pursue

I've tried a couple of PD/shareware products which helped analyzing
nonDOS disk structures (and dumping contents of selected sectors), but
off-hand I can't recall much in the way of names. I <do> recall that I
picked up the tools over on The Advocate (see prior msg for contact info).
Seems to me one of the better ones was part of the CP/M emulator
packages over on The Advocate--Z80MU or 22NICE/22DISK come to mind--but
I'm not positive about that. If you still are looking for help and you
can't locate something useful over there, leave me a msg on that board
as a reminder and I'll dig around a little when time permits....In any
case, while I've yet to find an "ideal" tool, I have been able to
determine the basic structure of things as esoteric as typesetting disks
with what is available.

to ALL re: RECOMMENDATIONS?

I've been commissioned to submit a feature-length article for a
national computer magazine on the role of software in the start-up of
a small business. An emphasis will be on the <types> of software which
are important, but I'll also be naming some product names.
         Obviously, opinions weigh in heavily, so I'm soliciting some
general input. If interested, leave comments here or directly on a
board I run (The Advocate, 312.939.4411, 300/1200/2400, 8/n/1, central
Chicago) by April 5....What types of products do you feel are
important? Shareware responses are welcomed too, if you want to name
names. Feel free to approach the question from unexpected slants.
(Note: I expect to use most input as background, but attribution is
possible. If you do <not> want your name mentioned, please be say so.)
      Secondly, I <<do>> plan to include quotes based upon short phone
interviews. But in this case, I need people who can be "labeled."
E.g., "proprietor of Gee Whiz Consultants." Or, "Computer Coordinator
for the Wheaton Small Fry Company." If you have opinions on the
subject and want a little free PR for your company, summarize the
company and your role in it in a sentence or two and let me know when
we can chat voice. If you prefer not to leave a public message, you
may leave a private message on The Advocate.
         Thanks.

to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/HAVE CLIPPER/ WILL DEVELOP

  I "do" use SHARE due to my large HDs and partitioned with DOS 4.01.
 I got one response today from the programmer that I should TRY:
   SET CLIPPER=F31    which didn't do a thing!
 I might CALL Calif. in a day or two after she gets my printouts
to see if she understands what the SHARE pgm is doing. Interesting...
I always seem to catch bugs no one else ever runs across (or reports).
  Seeing that the files the pgm creates and reads wind up on C
while the pgm itself is on D, it HAS to be something with read/write
on the "specified" drive. The wierd thing is when I hit "A"bort
when the error comes up, the pgm continues (of course it doesn't
read the file on C (I have to do a simple setup each time it is run
on one pgm due to this).

Msg 43417 is 06 line(s) on 03/29/90 from SCOTT SMITH
to BILL WOLFF re: DBII CONVERSION

Bill, there is a program that comes with, or used to come with the dBASE
III/III+ called dCONVERT.  This allows the user to convert .DBF files,
.MEM, etc. to the appropriate III/III+ formats.  Very easy to use, and
relatively fast.  Should work for you, if you don't need to go back to
a dBASE II format for any reason.  Leave me a msg here if you need more
help with this.

to JIM POLOUS re: R/SPEAR TECHNOLOGY

Being by nature a statistician, I wish I had that large a sample of Spear
 machines, but all I had was my one Spear!  Actually, I've been
satisfied with the hardware; it's the customer support that's been frustrating
It took 7 months of phone calls and finally some serious threats (which
I deplore!) to get the promised $100 rebate.  Spear also suffers some
quality control problems, as evidenced by the fact that I just spent three
weeks and three trips to their Northbrook offices getting a problem
fixed--it turns out that the mounting screws for the motherboard were
lacking insulating washers (approx. .5 cents per!!), which caused
shorts in the motherboard!!
    Now the machine is happily running DOS and UNIX in coexistence, with
no apparent problems, but I'm still disappointed in the service, especially
in view of the fact that the hardware technician didn't seem to know a
whole lot more than I did!!

Msg 43419 is 10 line(s) on 03/30/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/HAVE CLIPPER/ WILL DEVELOP

Unless something has changed drastically between DOS 3.3 and 4.0, SHARE
has nothing to do with large disk partitions.  Rather, it manages multi-user
access to files (mainly over a network).
My Clipper manual says nothing about "SHARE ERROR" so I suspect the
error is coming from SHARE itself.  The fact that your program continues
after you respond to the message suggests that as well.
Again, at least as of 3.X, SHARE is concerned only with arbitrating
access to files over a network (checking for file and record locking).
There should be no reason to use it on a single-user setup unless you're

Yes I have heard many nice things about Fox Base. A friend of mine has
it. Although I couldn't tell the difference between Fox Base and dBase
III. I do hear Fox Base is more likeable.

One other problem I face, is my dBase II runs on four of my computers.
But dBase III only runs on one. I have some fear about having data
only accessable on one computer. Although I admit, my world doesn't
crumble if my computer goes down. Plus if I am worried about MS-DOS
running data, why worry! Someone always has access to MS-DOS right?

Thanks for the tip! I haven't been on ADVOCATE in quite sometime.

to SCOTT SMITH re: R/DBII CONVERSION

You say dCONVERT? I think I have seen that somewhere. But I think I
would like to switch back and forth between dBase II and dBase III.
Because of my setup, I like entering data on dBase II (the computers
is more accessable for me) and then transfering the data to dBase III
to print the results. But may update and want to go back to dBase II.

I know dBase II transfers TXT files to and from dBase! But I don't
know if dBase III has that? If so, it may just work moving the data
around!

Or I may just abandon the whole idea and just stick to dBase III as
Ward has suggested.

Does anyone know of a LOCAL repair depot for 8" Mitsubishi half-height
drives?  Most computer stores I've called vehemently argue that there
is NO such animal!  Intelligence abounds!  I think Com Ed dealt me a
big goof, but I have no way of being sure other than several power
circuits being messed-up.  Leave a msg here if you know of a place to
have these fellas checked-out.   Thanks.

Jerry -
Thanks for the info; I'll check out the Advocate (and answer there, too).
But what I'm really after is info, not software.  I want to find out HOW
those programs work, not investigate the format of a specific disk.
Eventually, I want to incorporate some arbitrary-format capability into
some of my own software.

to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/HAVE CLIPPER/ WILL DEVELOP

 I hate to start anything when I don't know too much about the subject
BUT DOS 4 asks for SHARE to be loaded with the large partitions. It
must be part of the feature for partitioning large HDs. It also
states in the manual that it should be used with partitions/drives
over 32MB. Looks like a problem with Clipper and DOS 4.
  I just love these situations I get myself into with MY choise
of files to use.
