 Since the (708) vs (312) issue has come up and that list was from
a "before then" era, and simply because it was several months old, it
was deleted. Also, old msgs get deleted automatically no matter what
they are - keeps "old" info from staying around too long.
 Please don't call me "sysop" - I hate that "generic" name!

Msg 43111 is 04 line(s) on 01/30/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to BILL WOLFF re: R/MICROBYTES!

 Seriously, is it called "microbytes"? That's the name of the column
of miscellaneous small topies in BYTE. (though I notice there's no
(C) or (R) near it.
 Interesting.

to BRENT JONES re: R/CLIPPER

 Are your questions really CLIPPER related, or are they more DBASE
"language" related? I program a moderate amount in Dbase "language"
(but in Foxbase as a program).

to JAMES SCHMIDT re: R/CIS FIXPAR.THD

 I just found it easier to zero something than to figure out how to
put something in the "formatted" partition table - for example, there
are sections for "system type" or something like that - i.e. words with
DOS-16 or DOS-12 etc - and other columns for "bootable yes/no". With
hex, you just hold down the 0 key typamatic until you've zeroed the
designated area. Trying to figure out, or tell, what to type in the
partition TABLE would be MUCH MUCH harder. Also, I wasn't recommending
a novice try it - I think I used words like "very dangerous", etc.

 Are you using base services, or extended services, in the network?
 Oh, I forgot - this is running Novel Netware. I only know IBM's lan
software. I'm sorry it is a dilemma that we have the - what is it -
ICLAS network running on Novell, which we consider a "competitor".
 I can tell yo how to get a printer going on IBM PC Lan version 1.3,
but not on Novell. I have absolutely no idea.
 My answer sucks. (pardon). We've got to find a way to support
Novell users!

Msg 43115 is 03 line(s) on 01/31/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to RUSS REVZAN re: R/HELP

This is just a shot in the dark (I'm not very familiar with Novell), but
if Microsoft conventions are supported, shouldn't there be a NET SHARE
command to name the printers to the rest of the network?

Msg 43116 is 06 line(s) on 01/31/90 from BILL WOLFF
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/MICROBYTES!

I guess your right about having a (c) or a (r). But I could not find
any statement concerning this. From what I have been told, it is from
Byte magazine and downloaded from BIX and requires a fee of some sort
costing over a hundred dollars to display on your BBS.

Do you know more about this then I do? <BW>

Msg 43117 is 14 line(s) on 01/31/90 from RUSS REVZAN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/HELP

I know it is not your problem, but is there any way I can find out?
I am not getting much help from the people I am supposed to deal with.
The voice mail is always full.
It seems to me that if IBM really wants to make more of the education
market they might be a little more helpful.
A couple months ago I asked someonr at to send me a catalog
of educatioal software so our school could consider buying some.
I have not recieved anything.
Doesn't IBM want business or is one school with 33 computers matter?
Remember Ward, I not venting my anger at you personally, but you
are, at least through this BBS available to me.
I am grateful for your help and time.

Thanks for trying to help.
I will check tomorrow to see
oops
NET SHARE command.
I was led to believe that since we are running IBM IClass, NOvell was to
be totally invisable to me. I guess this is another instance of
misinformation.
Thanks again,
