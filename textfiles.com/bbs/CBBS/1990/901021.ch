  CMS Enhancements, Tustin CA, and Core Int'l (the latter advertises in
SOME PC magazine issues - not all) both make after-market drives for the
PS/2 family.  Either should be able to help you.

  Does this file transfer need have to be remote?  Or local?  I know of no
remote-access file transfer software - while PC Support allows file transfer
to twin-ax connected micros.

I have an IBM PC with 256K ram on board.  It has two banks
of DIP Switches. Does anyone have a manual on how these are
set.  If you do, please leave a msg here or if you can please
fax me a copy of them  (708) 830-4380 fax or 830-4222 voice.
 Thanks .

Usually you can find it for about 499 or so mail order.
Check the Shopper or PC Ragazine.

Msg 44064 is 08 line(s) on 10/19/90 from MICHAEL SHARTIAG
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: IBM/SYSTEM 36

Hmmm.... Remote file transfer is exactly what I was looking for...
the IBM is in New york, and I want to send/ receive ascii or
(EB-SI-DIC) ((its been so long, I don't even remember the exact IBM
character set name)) files.
   If a transfer protocol is out of the question, what are my chances of
doing a straight dump out of the machine, like copying the file to the
modem as a means of getting it out.  If I used error correctiong modems
this could possibly have satisfactory results.

Msg 44065 is 03 line(s) on 10/20/90 from JIM ANDERSON
to ALL re: IBM AT FOR SALE

I have several IBM AT for sale.  640k, 40 mg hd, 1.2 mg floppy, EGA, and EGA
monitor,  $800.  Same but 30 mg hd $750, 20 mg hd $700,  mono $75 less,
80278 $75 more.  Jim or Paul  in Elk Grove 708-981-9300 say you saw in here

Msg 44066 is 05 line(s) on 10/20/90 from AL GORDON
to ALL re: IBM USER GROUP NEWLETTER?

Are there any IBM-PC user group publications in the Chicago
area?  I am calling from California and would like to advertise
in the biggest one (or two) publications in the area.  Phone
numbers in addition to names (for contacting purposes) would
be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.
