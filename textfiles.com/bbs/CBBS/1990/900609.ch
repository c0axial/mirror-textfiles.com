]Ward; Come on...you are a BIGGIE. I bet they all had heard of you.
And put me down for one of those printers too. Would you believe
my "state of the art" printer is a 1979 Epson MX-80 F/T dot matrix.
If it really is smokin' it cranks out 80 CPS !!! Oh yes, I do have
a Diablo Dasiy wheel too!! (it kicks at 15-20 CPS!).
Both are really funny connected to a 33Mhz 386, Super VGA, with a
700 Meg hard disk, and a 20Mhz 386 with a 110 Meg hard disk!
I guess I need to update my printers :-)

The BBS lists didn't keep coming my way, so I had nothing to post.

to ALL re: RETURN FROM COMDEX

 Just returned from Comdex. AFter seeing the Fall one in 'Vegas, that
had about 2x the attendees, it was a little bit of a let-down. But mostly,
I guess the thrill of going to my first one was what was gone.
 Had a great time with my friends at Magee Enterprises booth (AutoMenu,
TreeView - my favorite - and a new product - a screen manager library
for programmers).
 I had a chance to check out most of the laptops - from Poquet, to Toshiba,
Sharp, Maxar, NEC, and others - nothing made me sorry of my recent purchase
of a Toshiba T1000XE. The Sharp WAS smaller, faster, higher res, but the
built-in batteries aren't acceptable to me since I discovered removables.
 Got to shake hands with quite a few "biggies" - Byte Editor Wayne Rash,
Dvorak co-author Anis, PC mag biggie Barry Simon, Dennis Hayes, Phil
Katz, Shel Hall (Biggie @ Crosstalk), and a host of BBS biggies @ a Hayes-
sponsored meeting. Generally a grand time! The stress and bad vibes
really melted away for a few days. Very hard to come back.
 Nothing else too exciting - jillions of 486s running 117MHz Landmark
speeds, (i.e. "equivalent AT MHz"), etc.
 Tektronix demoed my next printer - a $7999 300 DPI color postscript -
down $2K from the revolutionary-priced QMS ColorScript - and better
quality. Uh, anyone got a spare $7949? (I'll add the $50 ;-)
 IBM, Compaq, Microsoft, etc weren't at the show!

Looking for anybody with experience with this or other disk cache
(software) products. I hear Super PC-Kwik is really good, plus have
seen two or three articles lately about how these progs speed up
disk intensive activity. Any thoughts or war stories???

to MARTY DIPPEL re: STUFF

Marty; I have a couple of utilities for you. These are the ones
I was telling you about, (eg. you could kind of beta test)
Let me know how I could get them to you.
