  Sorry you left comments instead of a msg!  Not many people see the
comments (myself and a few friends).  I don't know of a computer-specific
magazine in the Chicago area - other than "Computer People" which I've
seen a few times a few years ago - not even sure it is still around.
  (anyone reading this, leave a msg to Al saying what ever add'l info
you might have).

  The 20 part of 2000 is the 64K chunk of memory that is failing -
in your case, it is failing @ 128K - that probably means that you only
HAVE 128K in the machine and are trying to address more than that.
  With 128K, switch block 1 should be ..00.... and 2 S/B 10111000.

I set the switches as you suggested, I now get error 1001 201 and
parity check 1.  The whole system freezes up and I have cold boot it.
I changed out the ram in Banks 0 and 1 and there is a total of 256k of
ram on the motherboard.   Any suggestions?    Thanks

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/VGA MONITOR ON CGA

Why would I want composite video inputs on a VGA monitor? Easy... I have
lots of monitors around and if I can narrow it down to one or two, I'd
be doing good.

Composite inputs are good for VCR's, game machines, Commodore's, Apple's
and tons of other stuff like video camera's and such. There are composite/
RGB (CGA) monitors out there. But there are getting rare lately. There is
only a small curcuit in front of a RGB monitor to make it composite. Why
if multisync monitors can handle CGA (can they) then adding composite is
a piece of cake. Where are they? Do I have to make my own? <BW>

Hello,  I got ahold of the coherent system about 2 weeks ago.  As I have
never used any sort of *nix before, I did have some problems.  Here are soome
of the problems I found.
1:  The compress is 12bit due to the use of segmetion (64k code|64k data)
2:  You can only write software in the small model (note: this is a kernel
    restriction and not in the complier (which is decent))
3:  The docs are OK, if you are familier with *nix already.
.
Now for some advantages:
1: For $99.95 the price is not to bad if you just want to learn how the
    *nix systems work.
2: If your just wanting to use it for some small apps for multi-user its
   perfect.(I just finished a schduling program and can have 3 people using
   it at the same time.(I have 2 Televideo terminals hooked up to a AT(286)
   and can have all three in use at once!!(try that in dos...))
3: The complier is VERY decent, it close to other MWC work.
4: If you normaly use the small model any way, you should have no problems.
.
I hope this helps you. If I can be of anyhelp, leave a message here, on GENIE
at G.CLARK8 or you could call me at home at 713-893-5893 and ask for GB(I
live in Houston, TX for the time zone)
