No, not going to Software Development '90 - I generally don't go to
"anything" (I'm a "loner" and that directly reflects in the amount of time
I spend computing ;-). I DID enjoy Comdex last fall - and plan to continue
to go - at least as long as "friends in the industry" pick up the room and
board in return for my help in their booth (I pay my own air transportation).
 Going to Spring Comdex?
