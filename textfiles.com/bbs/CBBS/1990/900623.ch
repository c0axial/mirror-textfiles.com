I too am looking for HAM BBS info. Years ago the HeathKit store in Downers
Grove ran a BBS. My guess is that HAMS use packet or something via
HAM radio nowadays?

For those not seeing it yet the Suburban Library Swan system is
a great use for modeming. It does searches by author, title, or subject of
the almost 1 million titles. All this from your home. User instructions are
available at the Oak Park Public Library and probably others also.
Now if we could get into the statewide system (smile).

1) Does anyone know if the Northen Ill Apple Users Group still meets at
Harper College in Palatine?
2) Does anyone know of a low cost modem package with XMODEM for the Apple -
 ie. a program that you would recommend.
Thanks for any assistance.
