to BILL MATTSON re: COMPUTER DEALERS

 It's been a while since I have had occasion to buy from a regular computer
dealer. In the western suburbs, Farnsworth has a good reputation with me,
and had at one time the best repair department around. I tend to avoid
places like Elek-tek and Computerland, which are strictly sales and no service.
If you want a lot of freebies bundled in, look in the Sunday business section
of the Tribune for dealer ads.

Msg 43673 is 12 line(s) on 06/04/90 from ED FOSTER
to PHIL SCHUMAN re: R/PARADOX/LOTUS HELP

 Depending what your "100 elements" mean, what you say you need seems to
lie well within the capabilities of a standard spreadsheet program. Most
of these have some sort of database capability, with key matching and summary
capability; the catch is that all your data has to fit within the worksheet.
{ Excel and Quattro, the only ones in which I have used the data facility,
can easily extract parts of the database and graph them. And, since they are
spreadsheet programs, you can define the percentage column as a formula and
have the program calculate and display the value automatically.
 If you have a spreadsheet program with database capability, I suggest you
read the manual on that subject and go through the tutorial. If you don't
want to do that, leave a note on this board requesting assistance from someone
with specific experience with your spreadsheet.
