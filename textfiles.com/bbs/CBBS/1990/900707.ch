Msg 43762 is 04 line(s) on 07/02/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to MARK HEIDE re: R/NOVELL NETWARE

 I attended a meeting at Joliet Junior College in which they talked about
surveying local industry - finding that networking courses were needed.
 Moraine Valley has a bunch of networks; Oakton also is into networking.
 Whether or not they teach a course, I don't know.

Msg 43763 is 05 line(s) on 07/02/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to JOHN SERRANO re: R/A 4 MEG SIMM?

 I really don't know how SIMMs are addressed. Knowing that you can't
plug bigger chips in, I'm inclined to say you can't plug bigger SIMMs in,
but then I just heard that the PS/2 55-SX now supports the 4M simms, so
will go to 8M on the motherboard.
 Which machine are you talking about?

Msg 43764 is 08 line(s) on 07/02/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to STEVE SVIATKO re: USER FRIENDLY

 HA! This user interface was designed in NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. I
get a kick out of you saying "What can you expect from an IBM system,
though". This program is written in 8080 assembly language. Yes,
80 EIGHTY. heh heh.
 If you don't like it, consider having just learned a lesson in "how
things used to be". This is a historical system - the first BBS in
the world, to completely rewrite the user interface would be to kill
its historical aspects ;-)

Msg 43765 is 07 line(s) on 07/04/90 from BRENT JONES
to WARD re: USE LOCAL BBS?

Ward,
 I'm glad to hear that you like GrandView. I've got to get it one of these
days.
 Do you use any other local BBS? I know that you are lurking around
on CompuServe (especially on the Hewlett Packard and Toshiba forums).
But do you ever use Chicago area boards?

Msg 43766 is 03 line(s) on 07/04/90 from JOHN SERRANO
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/A 4 MEG SIMM?

I'm talking about my PS/2 30-286. There are spaces for four SIMMs.
Right now I have 1 mb on the system memory, but I think that I will
eventually need more ( > 4mb anyway).

Msg 43767 is 06 line(s) on 07/04/90 from STEVE SVIATKO
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/USER FRIENDLY

I can understand where you are coming from, and I stand corrected. I was
just looking around for some BBS's to call when I came upon yours. I have
an apple ][e with a 300 baud micromodem, also dating back to around 1978.
I have nothing against IBM computers, and I think that they are miles
ahead of apple as far as hardware goes. apple still conquers all with
it's exceptionally fast, powerful, and easy to use software.

to ALL re: OTHER BBS'S

help! i just got a modem and i am eager to call up many bbs's in the
chicago area. i know of only 2 bbs's that support 300 baud, this one, and
computist. (206-581-9292). i am tired of calling long distance all the
time, and this board is not apple specific. any phone no.s for bbs's
in the 708, 312, 815, or 414 area codes would be much appreciated.

Sorry it took so long, I haven't been on here for quite a while.
Also, as you discovered, we have moved and disconnected the bbs line
in Oak Park. Anyway, I am still interested in the IBMPC m.b. I
will try to call you at 708-358-5065 as soon as I can
Thanks!

Is it true that the SIMM modules used in the PS/2 series are propietary
items such that you can't pop in 4 generic 1 x 9 simms?

Msg 43774 is 05 line(s) on 07/07/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to STEVE SVIATKO re: OTHER BBSES

We have a half-dozen or so BBS lists over on a board I run (which you can
call at 300 bps). Using the SEARCH program, you could inspect all of them
at once for keywords of your choice (Apple, 312, whatever). Or, once
validated, you could download the list(s) of your choice. If interested:

Msg 43775 is 09 line(s) on 07/07/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to PHIL SCHUMAN re: COPY '*' BUG

If you're still having problems with this, a simple solution is a tiny,
dedicated program to concatenate all desired files without the unwanted
EOF characters. An alternative is a program to inspect the WEEK.DAY file
after its generated and convert the offensive characters to, say, spaces.
The latter could be tied to your current COPY command in a batch file as
well as used independently for other purposes. If you want to pursue
this, I could offer some quick direction or for a token amount quickly
put together either program. I can be reached at Advocate Enterprises,
312.939.3300, weekday afternoons. Good luck.

Msg 43776 is 05 line(s) on 07/07/90 from PHIL SCHUMAN
to ALL re: COPY '*' BUG ??

tnx to all who replied to my previous msg.
But you are missing the point. Sure, we got around the PROBLEM, but th
point is - is this a problem (bug) with DOS version 3.3 ???

Try it on various versions of DOS and see what you come up with.
