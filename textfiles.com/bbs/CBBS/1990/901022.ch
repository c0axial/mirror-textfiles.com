  There are NO papers like in Ca. I read one of the BIG ones there and
they are great but nothing like that here. 2-3 groups but nothing
so public and bountiful.

to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/IBM/SYSTEM36 Q

  Just last week I got a demo disk from Computer Labs International (CLI)
showing their DecisionLink PC-36 file transfer software.  It's a $300 package,
with both S/36 and PC diskettes, and to work it you need an emulation board
(CLI sells one for $595) in your PC, plus a pair of synchronous modems.
I haven't tried it out yet, but you might want to give Carl Burlin a call
at CLI at 714-779-2662.  He seems to know a lot about the products.
  If you need this only once in a while and you can wait a day or two,
Pivar Computing in Buffalo Grove can covert data from one diskette to another.
For a one-time transfer this would be cheaper.

I have an original 6MZ AT, with a 1.2 Meg drive and a 360K drive.  Both
are putty colored.  If you don't see an asterisk on the front of your
drive (it would be real obvious--bigger than the drive-activity light),
then you have a high-density drive.

to ALL re: FOUNTAIN RAM CARD:  HELP?

Anyone have instructions for setting the dip switches on a "Fountain"-
brand add-on RAM card?  It's stock number is SPCGXT-1.
