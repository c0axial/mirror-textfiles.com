]Roy is primarily living/working in Bloomington, IN, these days. His
"when in Chicago" number is 274-0531. I doubt you'd want his IN number
and supplying it would be a trifle inappropriate as it was supplied,
I believe, for validation purposes over on my BBS. (Such things are
kept confidential.) I do recall his OK to give out his Chi number,
though. If you in fact DO need to reach him in IN, leave me a msg with
the request that I forward it. I'd capture/mail it. Regards.

  Yes, I read your msg about the EGA and Paradise.
  Sorry you're having trouble with the "u" command.  There must be some
OLD code in CBBS that is somehow rejecting your name - perhaps a "2-letter"
last name isn't considered possible and so it is not put in the user log.
  Not sure.  I'll try to look into it.  Since it doesn't remember your
last call, use "o;-8" or something like that to take a quick One line
summary of recent msgs.  You can do "or;-30,t=tan lu" to find msgs to you.
  I just don't think people are inclined to buy used hardware from across
the country.  Too much hassle in case something happens in shipping, etc.

hello:

this might be pretty easy but...

i am looking for a way (s/w, h/w or "black box" patch) to run my
color/graphics card through rca plugs to an older color monitor.
does anybody know if this is possible (this amber stuff is getting old
for games, etc).

thanks,

bill moynihan

Well it sounds like you want to plug a RGB output to a composite color
monitor. Sure it can be done, but those devices are hard to find. Always
the best bet is to buy a RGB monitor. I have one of those composite
monitors too, that I wish I could do something with.

I believe some CGA cards does offer composite video out. But maybe I am
thinking of the MGA output. Yup! I think that is what I am thinking
of. Yup... maybe so... oh well! <BW>

Hey! Did you all hear that GEnie is going $6.00 per hour no matter
what baud rate you are using? That means 300/1200/2400 baud all for
$6.00 per hour.  Did you also hear that Electronic mail, encyclopedia,
stock quotes, shopping, EAASY Sabre service, U.S. and world news,
Single player games, and general info is now all free!

There is a catch with all this good stuff! It now cost a membership
fee to stay active with GEnie. No more free ride with not logging on
and not paying. Now you have to pay $4.95 a month extra. But then you
get the above items for free. You have to rejoin, if you do nothing,
you won't have account there any more. <BW>

Msg 43940 is 11 line(s) on 09/10/90 from GERALD PINE
to ALL re: ALTOS 5 1/4 HARD DRIVE

I have an Altos 5-5D machine, which came with one DSQD floppy and one
5 meg hard drive (ST-506).  The hard drive died and I picked up a 10 meg
drive to replace it.  The good news--the 10 meg drive works.  The bad
news--only 5 megs is recognized by the Altos.  Is anyone familiar enough
with these beasts to suggest a remedy?  I have a formatting program that
seems to be capable of formatting disk drives with higher capacity, but
when I double the number of sides from 4 to 8, which I think is the only
difference in the 5 and 10 meg drives, the format program works apparently,
but when I verify the format, the program blows up.  Further, if I ignore
the verify step and try to use the disk drive as formatted, the system chokes.
Any suggestions?
