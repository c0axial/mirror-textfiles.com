No, I haven't seen that book.  But I have been fortunate enough
to come across DOSTIPx.ZIP (x=1, 2, 3, 4), which sounds like the
same sort of thing.  Talking about tricks, I've discovered that
there is a rudimentary "else"-like function in the standard
DOS batch facility.  If you use the "|" pipe function, the
command after the "|" will not be executed if the "IF" statement
is true, but will be executed if the "IF" statement is false!
Sounds like something for Ripley's "Believe it or not!"  I've
been thinking of writing that up for PC Magazine, but wasn't
sure if it was something already known.

to GARY ELFRING re: PERFECT-FOUND MANUALS

Gary, I saw your message last August about perfect binding for
your manuals.  I'm curious about the following:
1)  How do the manuals hold up in regular use?  Do pages fall out?
2)  Are the manuals convenient for use by someone sitting at a
    terminal?
3)  Do you know off-hand the price for each additional 16 pages,
    beyond the original 64?
4)  Have you heard in the meanwhile of other companies that do
    perfect binding?
Thanks.

I've never had a page fall out of the manuals yet. They give a VERY
professional look to your work. They suffer from the standard problem
of all perfect bound manuals in that they won't lay flat. I lay a stapler
on mine to hold it open. Note that the majority of software manufact.
now make only perfect bound manuals. (Must be the price.) Pricing moves up
by 8 - 10 cents for each page increment (8 or 16 pages, I forget which).
Whitehall company is the only place I know of.

to ALL re: POWER STRIPS

Is there such a thing as a power strip designed for use with plugs that have
AC transformers (those bulky boxes) on them?  In other words, if it's got
eight outlets, can you plug eight of these in without the transformers
covering up other outlets?
No dup. chars.
