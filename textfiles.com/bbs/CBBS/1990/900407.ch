1 meg of ram - expandable to more - the extra 384k can be made into a RAM
disk and/or EMS 3.2 memory
all this and 12 lbs - tested out of the box - with DOS 3.3 -
Asking $1500

to ALL re: NOVELL ELS I & VGA

we have a ELS-I network of 3 nodes. 2 of which are VGA - using arcnet.
whenever we attempt ANY kind of video change we get an error from the shell.
even if we are not logged in, but just ANET3 connected to the server,
the problem exists - just a normal MODE CO80 causes problems.
programs that will run from a floppy without the network being connected
will have problems running from the same floppy IF the ANET3 shell is
invoked. The application for the network runs just fine, as it is just
normal text based - and never causes the problem to occur.
help ???

Help!
Can anyone suggest a good book or informational document detailing
the instruction set for the Intel 80XX series micros? More
specifically, I am looking for info on programming the 8748-51
series. I've been in the Motorola world to long and want to
broaden my horizons! I am intimately familiar with the Mot. stuff
and have done extensive development work with these devices, but
need info on Intel. I don't need the bare basics, only a
description of the instruction set, some examples and programming
info - HELP and thanks.
