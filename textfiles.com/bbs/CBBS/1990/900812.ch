to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/DISK LABELS

Yep, Benjamin Cohen was correct that I provide professional disk labels (and
other graphic arts products). I probably should use your message as a cue that
it's time to repeat my earlier blurb on the subject.but that's on one of
my other machines. In any case, best way to proceed is to call me voice at
312.939.3300 (afternoons best), or leave a msg on the BBS my business runs,
The Advocate-NOWAR, 312.939.4411, 24 hrs., Loop area. Your timing is quite
good. I have a couple of new software products within a few weeks of release
and could gang-run yours with them for a particularly good price. Looking
forward to hearing from you-and any other interested people.

to ALL re: SYSTEM DOWN/ BACK UP

 CBBS fried its motherboard. I had a mini-tower I was putting together
to replace the "Ward Board", so it came in handy to resurrect CBBS here
at Randy's.
 Sorry to have been down (8/10/90 @ 19:15 - 8/12/90 @ 20:32)
 Thanks for your participation in CBBS.
