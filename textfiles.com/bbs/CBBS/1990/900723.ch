to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/FLOPPY STACK=HARD DISK

 Well, part of what you're looking for already exists in a shareware
program called WSSI. At least it catalogs all the diskettes, keeps the
catalog on the hard drive if you wish, will sorta do a DIR en masse, and
will label (or relabel) a diskette on the fly. I think it also keeps track
of the free space on each diskette, so with a little elbow grease you can
easily find the optimal diskette to write a given file to.
 You might even think about finding the author of this and talk to him
about "commissioning" him to do the "extensions".

Am contemplating purchase of a Zoom Modem: 2400 Baud, Hayes compatible,
capable of sending (but not receiving) faxes. This is just for
recreational use. Any comments/experience with this modem would
be appreciated, I've never bought anything from this company.

I remember hearing maybe one negative thing about it. I think it had to do
with the modem having trouble connecting with USR Dual Standard modems; it
may have been fixed in newer versions.

 I've grown dependent on Randy's unix chinet node and, this weekend,
the system does not respond. I heard the systems sit side by side nd
thought you may have heard anything about chinet problems? Maybe I
could help him with some hardware or repair help.

Msg 43818 is 17 line(s) on 07/22/90 from RICHARD HODGES
to WARD CHRISTIANSEN re: COHERENT.

Hi. Just saw your BBS listing in the Computer Shopper and said
"Jesus! This is the guy that made the Modem-7 protocol I used to
use on my Kaypro!". I guess it was the predecessor to Xmodem.
Anyway, I live in Carson City, and am presently in New Jersey
installing equipment for my company. But actually, what I am
really interested in, is whether anyone knows of a bulletin board
for the Coherent system, which, as you might have heard is very
much like Unix, but for only a hundred bucks from Mark Williams
Company. I got it about a month ago, and am now seriously into
Unix/coherent. I have had problems with a couple device drivers
and sure could use some help from someone who knows Coherent!
So, I'll try to log on some time later when I get a chance, and
see if someone has left a reply. Want to call? My number at
home is 702-885-9548, but don't bother until August or so, as I
will probably be stuck in New Jersey for a couple more weeks!
Thanks for the use of your board, and take care.
-Richard Hodges- (I still can't believe I got hold of Ward C.!)
