  Didn't know what else to call it!  Mandelbrot squared didn't seem strong
enough of a subject!
  I was down in Champaign today at a PC fair (do we have to say PS/2 fair
now?) sponsored by IBM.
  I got to "run" the Wizard co-processor.  This is a board that plugs in
the Microchannel machines, and has an intel I860 RISC co-processor on it!
  The original Mandelbrot set, at 1024 x 768 resolution, calcs in about 5
seconds!  Even at very high zoom, the thing takes only a minute or less!
  It is capable of 80 MFLOPS single precision and 60 double precision!
(MFLOPS = Millions of Floating point operations per second).
  It was really impressive!

to ALL re: A800 REPAIR

Anybody know a good place to get an A800 8" floppy drive controller
for an Apple ][ repaired?  I just talked to someone at Laing Electronics
in Garden Grove CA that said they didn't do repairs anymore (or sales) so
I am looking for any suggestions on how to proceed other than replacing all
componebts on the card.
No dup. chars.
