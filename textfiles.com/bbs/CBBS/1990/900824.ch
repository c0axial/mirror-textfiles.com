to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/GOOD NOVELL TAPE DRIVE?

We are currently using a tape drive made by Emerald called the VAST
It holds 2.2 gig and runs either as a stand alone or can be added
to Novell 286 nets as a VAP. When used as a VAP it not only can back
up the server but also workstations. I am told that they will have
a NLM for Novell 386 "real soon now". It has proved very reliable and
reasonably fast.
