Msg 43334 is 09 line(s) on 03/10/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to TONY VENTICINQUE re: R/NEED FOR MODEM PROGRAM

You might want to ask over on the Advocate (312-939-3300, S. Loop) and
the Antelope Freeway (312-764-5162, Rogers Park). They have pretty good
libraries of CP/M software, though I'm not sure how much terminal support
there has been for the Rainbow on the CP/M side (I HAVE seen terminal
programs for the MS-DOS side of the Rainbow).
If the machine you're transferring the files to is an IBM compatible, you
might see if you could run a media conversion program that will let it
read your Rainbow disks; 22DISK is a shareware program that might do it for
you.

Msg 43335 is 03 line(s) on 03/10/90 from JERRY HASLETT
to ALL re: COM LINE EDITOR

Why, oh why doesn't CED or DOSEdit work on my xt clone? Is it the
oddball bios or the PCDOS? All that happens is a system lockup?
Any ideas?
