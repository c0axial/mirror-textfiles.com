to JOHN SERRANO re: R/HARD DRIVE WOES

 That, of course, is not normal. Of the jillions of 30's I've seen
(all with IBM drives) I've never seen that circumstance. Sorry you're
having a problem!
 What I think it might be is that you're over-taxing the power supply,
perhaps. I'd suggest putting a meter on the drive at power up time -
see what it goes to - perhaps an oscilloscope would be better (set on a
real slow sweep). Perhaps the start-up current of your drive is so
high compared to the flea-powered IBM drives, causes the "crow-bar" effect
on the power supply, and it shuts down - thus the drive doesn't spin.
 Another common problem is that some drives just plain "stick" - they
don't spin up. I've had a ST-225 that did that. My solution was to
apply my "physics" degree, and pick up the entire computer, and rotate
it slowly 1/4 turn, then "snap" it back, causing the platters to spin
slightly within the drive housing (lots easier than taking off covers
and nudging it with a screwdriver!)
 Do you have any other boards in the system? Is it running the original
IBM disk controller, or an add-on?

to CLIFF SHARP re: R/? PARTITION TABLE INFO

Best reference I've seen is Terry Dettman's "DOS Programmer's Reference"
(Que, 1988, ISBN 0-88022-327-8). It covers the partition table (info too
long to repeat here). It's a very good reference to MS-DOS programming in
general.

to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/PARTITION TABLE INFO

 Thanks for the Reference suggestion, Eric. I've been looking for one
that has more info than the Duncan book for some time, but haven't come
up with anything.
 Don't understand why it's too long to get into, though, as the tables
themselves (four of them) seem to be 16 bytes long, starting at offset 7BE
into the data on Cyl 0, head 0, sector 1. is it really that complex?
I'm scaring myself! :-)

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/HARD DRIVE WOES

 Surprised to hear about the problem with an ST-225, Ward. I've never
had the problem or heard about it before with those babies. Now, the
ST-251 is reputed to have sticktion problems.
 I've got two -225's here, one of them bought in Jan 1986 and the other
made up of the electronics from one reject (brand-new) unit and the
"mechanics" of another reject (brand-new again); the only significant
problems I've had are occasional bad-sector messages from my read-ahead
cache, which scare me into an occasional low-level format. (The older
of the drives appears to have had a head crash at some time, though it
slipped right past me!)

 Well, now I know the answer to my question. Not a lot of contents
in the table, but it took a bit of explaining over the phone.
 Now, all I've got to do is get used to this danged 5.1 assembler.

 Thanks for the book suggestion, again. It's at the top of my list.

THE ONLY CARD I HAVE IN THE 30-286 RIGHT NOW IS AN MFM CONTROLLER THAT
CAME WITH THE SEAGATE ST151. ANOTHER PERSON TOLD ME THAT IT MIGHT BE
A BAD CONTACT, BUT I DON'T KNOW. THE ONLY OTHER 3RD PARTY DEVICE I HAVE
INSTALLED IS A PACIFIC RIMS SYSTEM 5.25" HIGH DENSITY DRIVE. SOMETIME
IN THE FUTURE I'M CONSIDERING GETTING A MicroWay 386/33 ACCELERATOR TO
REPLACE MY (CRAWLING) 80286-10. I NEED TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT MicroWay
IS A REPUTABLE COMPANY, AND WHETHER OR NOT THEIR PRODUCTS ARE ANY GOOD.

ANY ANSWERS TO THE SECOND HALF OF THIS MESSAGE WILL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.

to WARD re: GRANDVIEW

Ward,
 How are you liking GrandView? I got a demo disk that does everything,
except for saving files-crippledware. It looked OK, but not that much of
an improvement on PC Outline.
 I also had a RED DJ ink cardridge clog up. I think it might be the ink.
I used Schaeffers Skrip. How about you?
 I called James River Corp on their papers and transparency film. They
down from 70 products (laser & ink jet) to only 5 for laser printers.
Several people were quite candid with me. They say the "higher ups"
made a mistake. I got an address, which I will post on CIS HP forum,
where we can as a group apply continued pressure. You see they still
MAKE the paper and film, they just have it in huge rolls to sell to
someone else to cut up.
 Were you the one who said that he was sorry that he didn't skip the
downloadable fonts on the DJ? Could you explain?

Msg 43741 is 08 line(s) on 06/27/90 from CLIFF SHARP
to ALL re: SUPER VHS RENTALS?

 I'm so aggravated I could spit. We just bought a super VHS recorder
and can't find any rental tapes in the super format! Anyone know of sources
for them?
 Also, I've been thinking for some time about getting one of those VCR
backup systems, but looking at the error rates etc. and pooh-poohing the
idea. Anyone know if super VHS recorders (with their increased freq.
response, etc.) are any better at this task? I haven't seen any ads or
info on this anywhere.

to ALL re: CALCULATOR FOR MS-WINDOWS

is there a scientific calculator program (that performs similar to an
expensive hp) that runs under windows? if so, what's the going rate?

Msg 43743 is 08 line(s) on 06/27/90 from DON PIVEN
to CLIFF SHARP re: R/S-VHS RENTALS

Well, considering that there's still around $500 between consumer
VHS and S-VHS, most studios aren't releasing much on S-VHS, not to
mention the lack of sources causing the lack of rentals.

I would suspect that there wouldn't be any big difference using
S-VHS vs VHS as a backup medium. Some stuff I read awhile back suggested
that a lot of the errors was due to gross errors caused by the media. Using
premium tape would probably help more than going S-VHS.

Msg 43744 is 04 line(s) on 06/27/90 from DON PIVEN
to JOHN SERRANO re: R/MS-WINDOWS CALC

I assume you're still using Windows 2.x - Windows 3 includes an enhanced
calculator which includes most of the things you find on sci calcs, plus
base conversions and stat functions. It isn't programmable, though, if
that was what you were referring to by "HP-like".

Msg 43745 is 17 line(s) on 06/28/90 from PHIL SCHUMAN
to ALL re: PC & TOKEN & AS/400

We have some questions about how and what can be done with
PC's on a token ring network along with a 3174R.
If the PC's are on a token ring network.
 1. How is 3270 emulation done - - PC 3270 emulation
 software via the 3174 as a gateway ??
 2. Can we also run Netware file servers on the same
 physical LAN that has the 3174 and 3270 emulation??

If a AS/400 is added to the ring, along with the PC's and
the 3174.
 What can we do with that type of environment ??
 Can the PC's get to applications on the AS/400 ??

And lastly - for the AS/400 - if a another city has PC's, a token ring
and a 3174R for connection to our mainframe, can we setup a link
between the other city's 3174 and the AS/400 ??? or what ????
to allow the other city's PC's access to our AS/400 on the ring.

Msg 43746 is 12 line(s) on 06/28/90 from PHIL SCHUMAN
to ALL re: COPY '*' BUG ??

I think I have found a bug with the copy command under DOS 3.3x.
We have several daily files called FILxx.DAY that we copy into a weekly
file called WEEK.DAY. The command is COPY FIL*.DAY WEEK.DAY
The file content has nothing to do with the bug - as we can duplicate
the probelm but just copying more than 2 of any text type files.
Anyway - all the files are listed as the COPY command executes.
However, ONLY the 1st two files appear to be copied to the output file.
Actually, ALL the files are REALLY copied, but the EOF (x'1A') is twice
after the 2nd file, and then after the other files. It is on EACH
input file - - and no /switch combo can has been able to fix the problem.
I have tested this on Compaq DOS 3.31 and Toshiba (laptop) DOS 3.30
The killer is - it works just fine on DOS 3.10.

Msg 43752 is 09 line(s) on 06/30/90 from JOHN SERRANO
to ALL re: A 4 MEG SIMM?

I would like to know whether or not there is such a thing as a 4meg x 9 S
SIMM? While looking through the vendor's section of "PC Magazine," I
came across one firm that deals with memory chips. There it was, an ad
for a 4mg x 9 SIMM (selling for $549). Is that a typo, or are they
referring to four 1mg x 9 memory modules? If in the event that this ad
was true, then could I possibly install 4 4meg modules in my PS/2 model
30-286, for a total of 16 megabytes?

Any input to this subject would be greatly appreciated.
