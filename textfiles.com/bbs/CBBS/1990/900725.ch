to CLIFF SHARP re: R/FLOPPY STACK=HARD DISK

 I'm a registered user of WSSI - matter of fact, he sent me the latest
to upload to Compuserve. But that's not the point. I love working with
Treeview (or name the directory manager program of your choice). I'd
LOVE to be able to simply address, say, drive "Z", and have it have a
bunch of sub-dirs, each of which represents a "normal" floppy, and the
subdir name is the floppy volume label. Only when I finally actually
look at, copy, or otherwise address the FILE itself, will the driver ask
me to stick in a diskette.

 Charlie is a friend and long time full-privilege assistant operator here.
No need to tell him the rules. He wrote some of 'em.

to JOE JESSON re: R/RANDY'S UNIX SYSTEM DEAD?

 Randy called me @ 10:00 Sat AM (the ONE time NOT to call me! I'm just
listening to the Whad 'ya Know monolog!). He said his drive took a
dump. He was working on it. So I must assume the system was down for
some drive problems.

Msg 43824 is 02 line(s) on 07/23/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to RICHARD HODGES re: R/COHERENT.

 The best bet would be to contact Mark Williams Software directly -
hopefully they'd know if there was a BBS for Coherent.

holder. I am asking .50 cents each or $30 a car load $250 a truck load

The binders are in Elk Grove

Msg 43826 is 06 line(s) on 07/24/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to ALL re: ACCESSING DOS SUBDIRS

I've been dabbling with code for a little "recreational" program which
requires direct opening/reading of DOS subdirectory files. The primary
open fxn (3Dh) returns an "access denied" error code. Following up a
tip, I've have tried the FCB-style open fxn (0Fh), but it was just as
unsuccessful. Does anyone know the necessary steps to open/read subdir
files?

Msg 43831 is 08 line(s) on 07/24/90 from CLIFF SHARP
to JERRY OLSEN re: R/ACCESSING DOS SUBDIRS

 Jerry, as far as I know you can't open a subdirectory in any standard
way under DOS. You have to follow the directory chain using physical
reads (or logical sector reads, of course) and calculate its location on
the disk, then do direct sector reads to get the subdirectory.
 I would suppose you could 'chmod' the directory into a file, maybe, and
then edit the file and 'chmod' it back into being a directory, but I've
never tried that; DOS may refuse to clear the 'directory' bit for you
under the 'chmod' call. Might be worth a try.

Joe, I'm interested in the IDE drives. Please tell me what you

 1.) Number of cylinders
 2.) Number of heads
 3.) Number of sectors
 4.) Precompensation value
 5.) Landing zone
 6.) Brand and model
