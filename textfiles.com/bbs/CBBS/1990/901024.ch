Msg 44073 is 06 line(s) on 10/23/90 from ROBERT BOLE
to ALL re: USING IBM'S FTTERM W/ COM4

I have COM1 and COM2 on my system.  A mouse is on COM1 and works.  I have
an internal modem which responds to Crosstalk Mk.4 as COM4.  When I use
IBM's FTTERM, the software will not run if the DEFAULT.SET is configured
for COM4.  If I configure the DEFAULT for COM1 or 2, it loads, but will
not dial if I load a SET using COM4.  To Ward: if you know the answer,
but its too much to type, I'll be at the APCU meeting on Saturday.

Msg 44074 is 04 line(s) on 10/24/90 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to ALL re: 3.5" DISK MOUNTING

I recently acquired a 3.5" floppy drive without mounting brackets.  Where
can I get brackets, bezel and the little adaptor boards for the data and
power connectors so I can install it in my AT clone?  I bought the drive
from a private party, so I can't just go back to my dealer.

Msg 44075 is 04 line(s) on 10/24/90 from NAZIR PASHTOON
to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/PC/AT FLOPPY PROBLEMS

I did respond to your question earlier, but Ward has erased some responses.
Accordind to Thom Hogan's "The Programmer's PC Sourcebook" the 1.2 M drives
were first introduced with the AT, Aug. 1984. The recommended DOS version
at the time was DOS 2.2.
