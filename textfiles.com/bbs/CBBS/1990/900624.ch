 Got my external 3.5" for my T1000XE (a 6.4# notebook with 20M hard disk but
NO floppy).
 It is REALLY small - only 7/8" thick. Unfortunately it is not light, at
1-1/4 pounds.
 For those rare times that you really DO need a floppy, this is not a bad
way to go. Unfortunately, there's no specific "slot" for it in the carrying
case, matter of fact, there's an annoyingly "just a teeny bit too small"
place - meant to hold the power supply, but there's another identically sized
one that if it were even 1/4" larger, would hold the drive.
 ====> I love this machine more than any other I've bought. The technology
is just outstanding. I hope nothing "blows it away" TOO soon!

 Has anyone else found a way to keep multiple DeskJet cartridges "viable"?
 My "red" one, while it USED to work, finally died by being OUT OF THE
PRINTER too long.
 Right now, I'm trying to revive it by letting it sit in a puddle of
distilled water. So far (overnight) no help.

I am not sure about the disadvantage of built-in batteries for laptops.
I have two laptops, one is a Epson PX-8 which runs 20 hours at a charge
or maintain things TSR for over four months. It's nice to pop in your
word processor like WordStar with a flip of a switch to start. This
laptop sports Ni-Cad batteries.

The other is a Sharp PC-4501 which I beefed it up till all the slots are
now used up. I added more memory, another drive, CRT adapter, serial port,
etc. It still runs about six hours on a charge and the battery could be
changed with a dime (for a screw driver) and a spare battery (which
currently is a lead-acid battery. But of course, if you did change
batteries, your setup would be lost and it would take a minute or so
longer to setup and also set the clock.

So in short, some built-in batteries give you the power of a replaceable
battery anyway without the hassle. So I haven't been spoiled by replaceable
batteries yet! So go figure! <BW>
