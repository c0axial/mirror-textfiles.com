I can find them. If.

to BILL WOLF/ALL re: CBBS 2400 ONLY!

 Based upon a phone call from Roy Lipscomb several days ago, I researched
the log - sure enough, CBBS has been accepting 2400 baud calls only since
the new hardware was put in place! I have to assume that the faster processor
is somehow related to my software timing (remember, we're running OLD CP/M
code here - not modern PC "timer tic" type software).
 I'm going to look into it this weekend and see if I can find what to
patch to get it working again.
 You might drop a note on other area BBSs that CBBS is 2400 only due to
the processor change, but that it is being looked into.

to BILL MATTSON re: R/WINDOWS 3.0

 I've installed Windows 3, but am disappointed - as I frequently am lately -
by the loss of older commands - I used to use alt-F9 and alt-F10 and alt
esc all the time to rotate between applications and maximize the appropriate
one, etc. I often wonder what logic people like Microsoft, and Norton, use
when they get you used to something then take it away.
 I've had no inclination to run ANYTHING under Windows, since at the HEART
of my PC usage is a control-Caps swapper software TSR, that Windows gets in
below and defeats. That makes Windows take all my programs hostage, and
makes me very anti-windows. I use windows as LITTLE as possible because
of that, and the unwelcome bright screens (though I've customized it a bit).
 With only 2M on a 286, and all the above, I guess I'm not likely to be
every very strongly into Windows 3.

 If you've seen the inside of ANY ni-cad operated appliance, as I have -
 - soldering iron
 - shaver
 - grass clipper
 - dust buster
.then you know that the batteries have ZERO extra space for anything.
I need solder tab, no "holder" would come even CLOSE to fitting, Matter
of fact, some times the thickness of the solder tabs themselves makes
it too tight a fit!
 Thanks anyway. I DID go to a holder in my MIDI keyboard when its very
expensive lithium battery died - a couple penlights have kept it going for
years.

 >> That's << the answer I'm looking for! I am sitting right here with one
solder-tab nicad (AA size) having put the other in my tiny printing calculator
 - I saw Mr. NiCad at a HamFest, and bought 2 AA's anticipating the repair
on my calculator, but then a few weeks later my Dust Buster stopped working,
and now I need a "C" size (or perhaps two, since I already replaced one of
'em already, and there are 3).
 Thanks VERY much!

to JIM POLOUS re: R/AST PREMIUM UPGRADE

 I have seen the latest, with their "Cupid" architecture. However, I'm
not looking to buy a NEW, UPGRADEABLE system, but rather to upgrade my
OLD, non-upgradeable system, hoping that due to its popularity (possibly
the third most popular form factor after the XT and AT form factors). Its
7-slot architecture and different mounting holes makes it not suitable
for putting a regular board in it.

to BILL WOLFF re: R/LOGGING ON AT 1200 BAUD!

 To reply to your msg in detail, no, the 300/1200 loss was a complete
surprise. I sure DIDN'T lock 'em out! Matter of fact, my own 9600 access
is GONE TOO! Something is completely wrong with the setup. It just dawned
on me, perhaps the modem itself got locked at 2400, but I suspect instead
some timing problems with the faster processor. It didn't answer calls at
all with "turbo" turned on - unless coincidentally that was a non-2400 call
also. I watched at Randys right after the new hardware was put on - after
kicking out of turbo mode, it answered the next call.
 Will investigate this weekend.

Yeh, I don't use TSR's myself, but am unhappy that W3 won't coexist
with QEMM 5.0. I did discover a trick, though, if you can't get
rid of a non-windows application icon after you've deleted the
application, or thought you did, using the setup process. All of the
icons are listed in a file with "MAIN" in the name. I'm being
cryptic because at this moment I can't remember the name of that
pesky file. I'll look again and report in a later message. I merely
edited the file, and crtl-Y'd the offending line with my trusty old
WORDSTAR in non-document mode!

to ALL re: RELISYS EGA MONITOR FOR SALE.

Hi, I'm calling from San Francisco. I'm not sure if I'm in Chicago when I
Log on so can someone tell me. My name is Tan. The real reason for this
message is to advertise my 2-month old Relisys Monitor. I'm a graphics
fanatic so I'm looking forward to getting a VGA Monitor. My suggested price
is $250 but I'm always open for deals. So call me at my place at
(415) 824-3085 in San Francisco if you want a good deal on a nice EGA
Monitor. Thank You and Hello Chicago.
P.S. A Paradis EGA card is included with the package.

Look at the bottom of your keyboard to see if there are any DIP switches
there. I had been using IBMFIX (or whatever it's called) for a few months
and then by chance happened to turn my keyboard over. Lo and behold, there
were two DIP switches, and one of them was labeled as swapping the Control
and Caps Lock keys.
