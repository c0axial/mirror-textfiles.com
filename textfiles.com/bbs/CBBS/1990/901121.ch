Msg 44169 is 02 line(s) on 11/20/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to CHARLES STEPHENS re: CP/M

No, sorry, haven't been involved with CP/M since about '84 or so.  I suggest
leaving a msg to ALL.

Msg 44170 is 05 line(s) on 11/20/90 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to MIKE REINHART re: USING +

+, by definition, retrieves the next 10 msgs.  +;+;+ would retrieve the
next 30 msgs.
  Another way is "qr;*" or "or;*".  That will do a quick summary with
retrieve, or a one-line summary with retrieve, of all msgs since your
last call.

What is the company where you can be reached?

we are out in the western burbs - Lombard, Glen Ellyn, Wheaton..
we have the package, but have not put it up or really gotten into it.
Have you worked with it ??

to BILL WOLFF re: R/MODEM MANUAL

I could come up with a stray manual, probably for a 1200 bps. At the moment
I'm absolutely swamped, though, so would ask that you send me a self-
addressed, stamped envelope large enuf to hold modem manuals (6x9 should do
it, I think). I think you have my address, but: 1130 S. Michigan 60605.

Msg 44175 is 04 line(s) on 11/21/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to ALEX ZELL re: "PORTING" A MSG

Colleen Devlin has a msg she prefers to keep private for you, which she
placed on my board. Sounds like quick attention would be appreciated.
(After picking it up, pls K it. I'm a little slow in zapping old stuff
this week :-})

Msg 44176 is 12 line(s) on 11/21/90 from JERRY OLSEN
to COLIN SCHROEDER re: EGA/HERC STUFF

Sorry for the tardy reply. I've been swamped creating a couple of major
DB apps and haven't come up for air (let alone called other systems) for
several days.)
        Let's see....If foggy memory serves me, the code I put up was
Turbo C-specific (sorry again!) and contained geninterrupt() and inportb(),
which should  be the only TC-specific stuff. inportb(), I believe, is the
equivalent of MSC's inp() fxn. It simply fetches a byte from an inport
port, so you also could pop in a little asm code using the IN instruction.
        geninterrupt() just invokes an asm INT instruction to fetch the
return value. My recollections is that MSC handles that thru its
__bios__equiplist routine.
        Hope this is still of use....

I haven't run across anything other than commercial products to do the job
well. I was fortunate to receive INSET packaged with a major app I bought
recently. Initial dabbling with it has led to some great results with little
effort and lots of nice bells and whistles. By chance, I just received some
promo from Inset Systems which lists the following direct-order and info
numbers: Orders: 800.828.8088. Info: 203.775.5866 (voice) 203.775.5634 (fax).
No dup. chars.
