  Here's the logic CBBS does when starting up.  

 - send, with char delays:  \nATS0=0\nATV0\n    <- this would hang
   (extra delay after \n)                          if no CTS/DSR
 - Type the help text on CBBS (Alt-(W)ho, etc)
 - type: >> AWAITING CALL
 - set 2400 baud (hmmm, not BEFORE sending ATS0..?)
   ----
 - loop watching ring indicate (also check local console for alt-keys)
   ----
 - type >> answering phone
 - Send ATA\n to modem
   ----
   Get a char from the modem.
   1  =  300 baud call
   3  = no carrier
   5  = 1200 baud call
   10 = 2400 baud call
   13 = 9600 baud call

The file RS232NS.COM is an alternate RS-232 driver that ignores DSR/CTS.
