 > What if you had two programs with the same name?
 I don't get it. How could I? I moved ALL my executable utilties
down to a \sys\bin\unused, then move 'em back as I need 'em.
 matter of fact I wrote a little "I.bat" that looks first for a .COM,
then a .EXE, then a .BAT, and if finding one, moves it back from
.unused to \sys\bin.
 You say your solution is to use 4DOS's description function -
my problem isn't that I don't know what they are - it is that it
would be a big process to sort thru 300 executable programs trying to
decide which you really use. With my trick, if you try to use it,
you have to "bring it back" from the .\unused directory.
 Actually, I have MEGABYTES to clean up on another system - but
it is not a matter of not knowing what it is, it is a matter of
trying to decide what to keep. I have a large neough hard disk that
I've become a pack rat - I have Turbo C, 1.0, 20, Turbo C+, Borland
C+, etc. Actually, the only one I use it Turbo C 2.0, so I'm
wondering if I should just "Blow the others away". But then again
might be nice to keep 'em around in case I "grow" into C+.

Msg 45973 is 14 line(s) on 12/25/92 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/DISK CLEANUP TIP

I meant, "what if you have two files of the same name and you
move them (sequentially) to your \sys\bin\unused? For example, what if y
had, in different directories, d.com (a GIF file viewer) and d.com
(a replacement for DIR)?" The problem would occur in moving files
to your 'unused' directory, since the second would overwrite the
first, etc.

Of course, you may not have this problem! I load many executables
via ALIASES, and the aiases sometimes have names different from the
commands themselves. In some cases, the directories don't have
to be on the path (e.g., for graphics stuff), so I may end up
with multiple executable files that share a name.

In any event, MERRY CHRISTMAS, Ward!

Msg 45975 is 10 line(s) on 12/28/92 from MICHAEL SHARTIAG
to ALL re: LASERJET 4M

  The Laserjet 4M was in fact held up due to an enginnering hold. The
person who I spoke to at HP was wrong on all fronts: The hold was due
to HP's desire to get postscript on a single simm thereby giving the
printer 3 open simm slots. The prototype unit used 2 simm slots.
 On the truetype font side: Truetype fonts are scalable; therefore
downloadable intot he printer, and the built in ones are also scalable
(It took some time, but I answered my own questions).

 Hope this might help somone else!

to ALL re: LINE NOISE FIXED./MA BELL

I received a present from Ma bell on Thursay. They left a message on
my answering machine telling me that they had fixed the problem with
my 545/777 connections. There was a problem with the return trunk to
Highland PArk via the Kedzie (and/or possibly another location)
switching station.
 I have had 100% error free connections since then. Within 1 week
of asking for a supervisor with each location (HP and Buffalo Grove) I
was able to get an answer other than "we found no problem" and actually
get it fixed.
 If anyone else was having line noise problem and its clear now
you were probably feeding back through the above mentioned station. What
nailed the problem down was that any call I made to a 545 or 777 prefix
modem was a bad line.

to answer OK then either never sync up, or the link is actually made but
the parameters aren't right. Changing the comm parameters on my end
