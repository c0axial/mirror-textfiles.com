to ANDY SHAPIRO re: CLONE AND DRDOS

Thanks for the info.  I'll have to check the version.  It is a
friends machine that his employer pitched.  I looked at it very quick
and saw DRDOS.  I had heard about the OS but that is about all.  Maybe
we'll just let that part alone if it will do the job.

Not seriously interested - yet- but the model numbers and asking prices
would help everyone who comes across your msg.  Thanks!

  None of the *dial-in* phone lines at Chinet and CBBS have tone
(DTMF) dialing.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/HP LASERJET4 & TRUETYPE

Ward,
  Trutype can not be simply rasterized.  AS they are
scalable fonts, one would tell the lser which fiont and what
size to make it.  I don't think this person at HP knew
what they were talking about.  This wories me for another
reason:  I was told by a distributor that the HP4/M was
on an engineering hold and none were available
  I was told that this was not
true, but that several people had called with the sa,me
story from around the country.  I have the feeling
that she might have had all the wrong answers

to ALL re: 1.44 FLOPPY NOT BOIS SUPPORTED

In attempting to upgrade a WYSE 386 PC
I have come to a slight problem.  The BIOS does not hjave
support for 1.44 meg, only 720K.  The setup program
was supplied by WYSE and uses PHEonix bios.
If indeed there is no setup for 1.44 meg, can a driver be loaded
to allow it?

Msg 45951 is 16 line(s) on 12/10/92 from MICHAEL SHARTIAG
to ALL re: DR/ HALO

I just upgraded to a S3 based video card and once
again have come across an incompatibility that I
can not solve.  It appears that the s# uses a 16 bit memory address for its
its co-processor that when decoded at the 8bit level
becomes 2E8.
This conflicts with my DATACOPY (Xerox) scanner.
While the card is configurable, the software program that
came with it (GRAY F/X) does not allow for any changes
in the driver selection.  It seems to be all preset
Xerox is of no help, and says that that part of the
software came from someone else..  This card had conflicted in my
386, but the problem went away with the change to a 486.
The sub-part of the package is HALO, or Dr. HALO, and
was written by Media Cybernetics.  Has anyone heard
of them, or know where I can get a hold of theem?  There
has to aaabe a simple table than can be updated.

to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/1.44 FLPPY NOT SUPPORTED

Check out the DRIVPARM parameter in your DOS manual under CONFIG.SYS.
It tells you how to alter the parameters for any of your floppy drives.
One caution:  If you set the parameters for 1.44 MB, you may not be
able to read 720K diskettes; and vice versa.  The solution would be
to use DRIVER.SYS to define one density, and DRIVPARM to define the
other.

Msg 45953 is 03 line(s) on 12/11/92 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to DENNIS STAHL re: R/CLONE AND DRDOS

Yep -- keep it!  DRDOS is a clone of MS-DOS; it's virtually
identical -- so don't think of it as 'different' from MS-DOS.
Just think of it as the NEXT version of MS-DOS.
No dup. chars.
