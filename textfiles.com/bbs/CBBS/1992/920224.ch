]Ward, your offer of the 128K cartridge sounds real good.  I don't
have Windows or ATM, and don't know how they'd run on my 640K,
original-vintage AT.  (The ROM BIOS is dated 1/10/84.)  Basically,
I'm looking to produce a manual of about 128 pages or more, using
various point sizes of Helvetica and Times-Roman.  As you know,
Times-Roman is built into the DJ500, but Helvetica is not.  The
RAM cartidge seems a more flexible solution than a font cartridge,
since other fonts or effects may suggest themselves as I get
started experimenting with the DJ (now on order from Elektek).
My address is 1433 W. Thome, Chicago 60660.  Thanks much for
your offer.

  Dunno if $129 for 256K is high or not - that's what I paid for 128K
when I bought my DeskJet.  I think it is just too small a volume business,
what with things like Adobe Type Manager & Bitstream Facelift, which give
scaleable fonts under Windows, without memory (i.e. it uses graphics, not
the soft-font mechanism).
  Would you like a 128K-er to play around with?  Possibly indefinitely? ;-)
  If so, leave me your adr when you (g)ood bye out of here.  AND say
something to help my memory, like "Re: the DJ 128K cartridge" ;-)

to JOE JESSON re: R/GRANDVIEW OUTLINER

  Yep, still love Grandview.  use it a LOT!  Found only one "bug" that
won't work - I don't want colors on the outline symbols to the left -
I don't WANT any symbol when the outline is expanded.  It WILL let me
set black-on-black, but won't save it.  SO, with its great macro
abilities, I set ctrl-@ to set the colors (grin).
   The speller is kind of nice, too!  I may have mentioned - but I wouldn't
normally have wanted a speller, but now that I have it, I like it.
  P.S. I use Grandview LOTS more lately - I have started taking notes at
business meetings, and everyone loves the details.

to GERRY SWANSON re: R/BASIC COMMUNICATIONS

  Here is a little communications program I wrote in BASIC - I write it
off the top of my head when ever I find myself in a situation where someone
can't figure if a port or modem is working, and I ask them to let me try
a little communications program.
  It has LOTS of shortcomings - like it has no "cursor", etc, but it is
the minimum code necessary to send and receive chars.  Basically it waits
for data from the modem or the keyboard, and when ever it sees KB data, it
sends it, and when it sees modem data, it displays it.  Since BASIC has
a built-in interrupt-driven communications buffer, it works "adequately"
for a quick call into CBBS, etc.

  If there's anything you don't understand, just look up the command details

to ALL re: CUSTOM VOICE IVR SYSTEMS

We will develop or assit development of Custom Voice Mail, Audiotext,
Voice Messaging, or Interactive Voice Response (Computer lookup and
telephone interaction systems).  Also would love to pull resources from
others working with PC based voice boards under DOS, OS/2, or UNIX.
Call Jay at 708-323-0734 ext 210.

Msg 45509 is 12 line(s) on 02/24/92 from DON PIVEN
to BENJAMIN COHEN re: R/WINDOWS SCREEN BLANKER

I had similar problems with Idlewild (the screen blanker that comes with
the Microsoft Windows Entertainment Pack) being, shall we say, excessively
persistent.  I found that in addition to the usual entries in WIN.INI,
IW also hooked itself into SYSTEM.INI -- in the [boot] section, there was
an entry that looked like SCRNSAVE.EXE=(pathname); ripping that line out
solved the problems.

(My problem was trying to run Swapfile to set up some virtual memory;
it insisted that I had I still had an open application although I was
sure that I didn't have anything open.  After some time, I realized that
IW might be considered an "open application" despite its not having a
window or icon.)

to ALL re: HIGH-CAPCTY DJ INK CARTRIDGE?

How do they pack twice as much printing capability into a Deskjet
double-capacity ink cartridge?  Is the ink thicker, so only half as
much can be spritzed out in each pass?  Is the ink identical to that
in the normal-capacity cartridge, but only half as much gets spritzed
because the "spray" command from the controller is half as long?
No dup. chars.
