to SHAWN BRYAND re: CALL

 CHAT isn't very useful here on CBBS - the system is in a rack with
no direct access to it, and if you were talking about a chat with ME,
that is quite tough, as I'm about 40 miles from the system.
 I'm not returning your call, sorry, very busy. Watching an educational
video tape (at 11:58 PM) - working long days), etc. If you want to leave
a question, I'll answer it - each of us in our own good time.

Msg 45645 is 03 line(s) on 05/05/92 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to ALL re: SOURCE FOR 8.5" X 7" PAPER?

Anyone know of a supplier for 8.5" X 7" paper? It's not easy to get
a precise cut using 8.5" X 14" paper. (Pages that are precisely matched
in width can be bound with silicone glue into book form.)

Msg 45646 is 07 line(s) on 05/05/92 from AL HIGGINS HIGGINS
to ALL re: ARCNET INSTALLATION

Does anyone out there have any background with Standard Microsystems
ARCNET-PC110 boards??? I'm trying to assist a non-profit group
install a ARCNET network between two PCs, to be three systems
in the future? We don't have the documents on the boards, (someone lost them)
All I can surmise is there 8 bit cards, one would use a coax cable between
the systems, and the software package they have is by IBM PC Network
Program. Any thoughts???????

Msg 45647 is 14 line(s) on 05/06/92 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to AL HIGGINS HIGGINS re: R/ARCNET INSTALLATION

A couple points: first, your network program will need to have drivers
for the cards. If they aren't supplied, you'll have to find someone
who sells third-party drivers (SMC probably has drivers for Novell,
but that won't necessarily help you). Hardware-wise, ARCNET boards
are interconnected using RG-62 coax cable. If you're using just two
boards, you can go direct, but for more than two you need to use a
hub, preferably an active hub. It amplifies the signals so that each
station gets a full-strength signal. You can't daisy-chain ARCNET
cards the way you can with Ethernet.
One software possibility, if the IBM program doesn't have the drivers,
would be to use the AI (adapter-independent) version of Lantastic.
It lists for $99/node, but Elek-Tek and places like that have it for
a lot less. The last time I looked at it (about a year ago), it had
drivers for most SMC cards.

Thanks for the reply, hope to work on this in the upcomming week!
Thanks for the response!

Msg 45649 is 03 line(s) on 05/06/92 from MURRAY ARNOW
to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/SOURCE FOR 8.5" X 7" PAPER?

I don't know if you can get that size off the shelf, but many print shops
will cut any quantity of paper to any size. They often give the choice of
either you or they supplying the paper.
No msg 45650

Msg 45651 is 06 line(s) on 05/07/92 from MURRAY ARNOW
to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/YOUR PROJECT

Thanks for your interest. I am aware of SBIR. I've tried to submit to that
program, but there are time constraints I can't meet. Anyway there are some
other technical problems for me getting funding directly from them. I am
currently talking to Com Ed and the Electric Power Research Institute for
funds. I hope to get news of either thumbs up or down later this month.
By the way, the detector is uni-directional not omni-directional.

Msg 45652 is 09 line(s) on 05/07/92 from BILL WOLFF
to ALL re: IDE INFO

I've been hearing from the fidonet echo (old messages) that those IDE
controllers hides bad sectors it finds from MS-DOS. It was also said
that those controllers reserve good tracks to replace the faulty ones
when they are known. One even mentions that you should never use a low
level format on a IDE hard drive. Is all this true and can anybody
tell me any more information about this? It's all news to me! My IDE
drive died before I used a low level format, then it worked for awhile
after, then died again after 24 hours. I doubt that this was related to
the above news, at least I hope not.
