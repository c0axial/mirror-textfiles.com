]Chaz: Thank you.
Line noise lately has been awful no matter where I dial.  First
dial up was via straight procomm.  This dialup is via a mnp simulator
that my son Matt dug up and it is connected here via mnp4 and not
glitch in a carload to bother me.  Watching the lights on the modem
I can see tons of garbage coming and going, nary a hint on the screen.
Chaz, met a guy at a recent usr/group/chi meet at Fermilab who bragged
that some guy from Hammond or thereabouts was visiting a west side
bbs.

  IBM has a center - National Solution Center for the Physically Disabled
or something like that - acronym is NSCPD.  They serve as a clearinghouse
for various IBM and non-IBM products.  Could be your friend might want
to go beyond just finding this one solution for Word Perfect.
  I don't have the # but IBM-direct (1-800-IBM-2468) should have the #.
Or you could call the toll-free IBM information #: 1-800-IBM-3333.  (I
didn't know about that until just now when I called 800-information trying
to get an NSCPD number for you.  COuld be NSCPD doesn't have a toll-free
number)
  Pad Thai forever!
