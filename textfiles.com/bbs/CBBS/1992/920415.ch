to BILL MATTSON re: R/POWERMETER PROGRAM

 There are some good benchmarks outside of the BYTE and PC Mag arena:
LinPac. This is a linear programming package, I believe, that one of
the "labs" (Argonne, Fermi?) runs across ALL machines from the biggest
IBM, Cray, etc, to an XT. BUT I think it is probably sensitive to the
quality of the compiler used as well as the machine itself. HOWEVER,
a single compilation for ALL PC benchmarks could remove that variability
at least across PC platforms. (Then again. lets say you want to compare
it to a machine running OS/2, Windows, and DOS - maybe the program should
be optimized for OS/2 for example).
 I wanna put a DX2 in my 486 but like I said, Intel is concerned with
BIOS incompatabilities.

 Are those Black cartridges? I think you're in trouble if you let 'em
go dry. My most success in re-inking is to use a postal scale, and as the
cartridge goes aound an ounce, I pump it up to 1.5 or 1.6ozs. If you let it
dry out, I think you will have problems getting it going again. My biggest
problem was when I tried working with blue ink, and thus had a blue, and
a black cartridge - the problem was the one that wasn't in the printer
dried out. You CAN buy the 'box' that HP uses for cartridge storage, and
could thus have a 2nd black cartridge.
 I have not looked at refilling color cartridges. I have 3 old, unused
color cartridges from my Canon PJ1080A, and I think I might try sucking
ink out of them (they use a needle in the printer and a rubber barrier that
it pierces) and putting it in the DJ 500C cartridge. If the chemicals
aren't incompatible, it might re-juvenate it.

Hi, this is Anonymous Jones calling from AJIS in Raleigh to say hello.
I try to visit every few years to make sure you are still going strong!

I'll be doing a tutorial on computer communications down in Dallas in
June and I always tell the folks that it all started here and they can
call to say howdy if they want.

Hard to believe that 9 years ago when Ward helped me on CI$ figure out how
to run BYE on a 64K Superbrain that both you guys and I would still be
around doing this mess!

Good luck for the next 15 years or so and take care.

to ALL re: 64K DATA BOUNDARY PROB

I have npt done any real serious programming on the MS-DOS machine. I
have done so at the 8 bit level and with mini's. The problem I am having
is as follows: In turbo Pascal 6.0, I am getting an error 49, data segment
overflow. From what I have found out, my variables are to big or numerous.
With MS-DOS appliations, memory addressing is limited to 16 bits, hence
64K windows. Borland ( & others) have given you a 64K segment for actual
code, one for data, and possbly one for the stack.
1) Is there another vendor out there that supports the 286/386/486
addressing capabilities in their compilers?
2) Is there a way around this problem with Turbo. I have not seen a
command to display its complier usage of the memoty area? (maybe a can
move a data structure to some other form of memory?)
3) Can I solve this with OS/2 and an OS/2 compatable complier that
allows full usage of the machines memory by that application?
4) Will Unix/Xenix 386 provide me with a solution?
5) Are there translators that will take my turbo pascal code and
create the pascal/C code that might work with one of the above?

Intresting. I do have a postal scale and never thought of weighing
the cartrigde to tell when it's almost empty. Will let you know

it is available!

WordPerfect for Windows is WordPerfect. THe only advantage (if it's
an advantage) for Windows users is mousable pull-down menus. (Actually
WP has pull-down menus, too, but most folks don't use them.) It is
supposed to be easier to use, however. But, it will be slow on any
machine.

Ward, take a look at Apple's PowerBook. They moved the keyboard way "up"
on the machine and put a trackball "below" it, along with a lot of room
to rest the palms. It's a very nice solution.

Msg 45591 is 29 line(s) on 04/14/92 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/64K DATA BOUNDARY PROB

In Turbo Pascal, you're dealing with four kinds of memory: 1) Code space.
This is where actual program code goes. 2) Static data space. This
is where global variables and typed constants go. As you've noticed,
each program can have only 64K of it. 3) Stack space. This is where
variables local to a procedure are stored. You can control the amount
of stack given to your program, but it can't be more than 64K. Note
that the maximum amount of stack used is determined by what procedures
or functions are active at any time; if procedure A has 2K of local
variables and calls function B which has 5K, you're using 7K. If procedure
C uses 10K, but never gets called from A or B, and never calls them,
then your maximum stack usage is 10K (not 22K). 4) Heap space. this
is where dynamically allocated data (obtained with new and released
with dispose) goes. You "talk" to data in the heap by using pointers.
The heap can occupy more than 64K (because the pointers are 32-bit)
but no single piece of data in the heap can exceed 64K.

Here's an example. Let's say you need two 35K character arrays. You
won't be able to declare them as global arrays, because together they
take up more than 64K. If they were both temporary buffers being used
by some procedures that never call each other, you MIGHT be able to
get away with making them local variables. The best way, though, would
be to do something like:
Type array35k=array[1.35840];
Var array1,array2:^array35k;
.
begin
.
new(array1); for i:=1 to 35840 do array1^[i]:=0;
and so on.

If they are onthe heap then other routines can call access these values?
Are there any other compliers out there for DOS that do not have this
64K boundary? instead of trying to patch this thing to run Imight
want to get it to a platform or language that will provide me with
straight through simple programming styles.

Msg 45594 is 03 line(s) on 04/15/92 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/64K DATA BOUNDARY PROB

I'm not aware of any Pascal compilers for DOS that don't have a 64K limit
on global data. There's no problem passing heap data through to other
routines-just be sure you understand pointers and dynamic allocation.

Msg 45595 is 03 line(s) on 04/15/92 from MICHAEL SHARTIAG
to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/64K DATA BOUNDARY PROB

What about other compliers? If I leave DOS and goto OS/2 can I get a
compiler that does not have the 64K limit. At this stage of the game I
am not tied to Pascal or DOS for that matter.
