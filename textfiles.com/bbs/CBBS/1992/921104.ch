to TONY ANTONUCCI re: R/FAX

 I finally ordered PM-FAX and I'll see how it looks. Doggone WinFaxPro
just didn't work under OS/2.
 Then the fax modem broke, rats.

to WARD re: KEYBOARDS AGAIN

Ward, try NORTHGATE. They have a 101-key keyboard that fits your specs
and ALL of their keyboards have a bank of switches that allow things
like custom placement of the control key. I think they sell for around
$100 or so, and they have a nice touch - a lot like the original
PC keyboard. If you really need what you asked for, that's the way to get
it.

Sorry. Deskjet black ink carts. $10 each new, $5 each expired (seems that al
all expired good anyway). Call me at 708-587-2388 if interested. Thanks

 60 watts out. Excellent condition. New lithium battery and
 panel lamps. $250
TNC: New KPC-3. Excellent condition. Original ram. Internal
