Do you have a Gateway? I think their offer is only for their customers.

 I can't remember too well, but wasn't that the 32 bit multiply bug? It only
showed up when doing 32 math, so was mainly seen with Autocad and Unix
systems.
 There was something about a "step level" , and a term like "Is that
a B-step chip?" but this is such old recollection. I tried to find things
in my Magellan database of saved messages, and found the quote in the first
3 lines of this msg, but couldn't find more. Found some reference to
a INPS (input string?) instruction, but nothing solid, More like me saying
"isn't it SOMETHING LIKE this." with no real hard facts.

to JERRY OLSEN re: R/CD ROMS

 Have you gotten into the OS/2 issues of CD-roms? I'm running OS/2
now and then, and would like to get the IBM developer's CD-ROM, so
I want an OS/2 compatible one. Also I'd LOVE for it to hook to my
IN-2000 controller, though I may be going to an Ultrastor 14F.

to ALL re: INFO ON SCSI CTLR.

Does anyone have any info pro/con on a SCSI controller manufactured
by CE Infosys? (Model C5610)
I purchased and installed one based on what the distributor told me
and it seemed like such a piece of cake. (I used it in conjunction
with a Seagate st14766n (663M) hd. for a client.)
I tried it installed as the boot drive and also with the driver as
a second drive, (after an IDE boot drive), and it appeared to work
positively super.
In the handbook it talked about connecting CD roms and other devices.
The price was <$100 which is cheaper than most I've seen.
I am asking the question because I've never heard of this controller
in any of the magazines, computer shopper, etc.
Any comments?

to WARD re: R/386DX "FEATURE"

Thanks for your response. My main concern was whether this "feature"
made the early 386DX to some small extent incompatible with 8086 machine
code. (For instance, setting STD as the default instead of CLD, or some
such arcanum.)

Ward.not to interject where not wanted, but I seem to remember OS2
only supports two CD-ROM drives. There is a ZIP file available with a
replacement CD-ROM driver for OS2 that is supposed to support more
drives than the 2 IBM likes. Available on C'Serve, and I also have it
if you like.can't remember it's name but can dig it out. Where can
one get info on the IBM Developer's CD-ROM you mentioned in your
message? I've also heard something about a beta test of developer's
something-or-other. Any info on such??? P.S. I'm referring to 2 CD-ROM
drive manufacturers, maybe one was Toshiba, would have to look in the
above-mentioned ZIP file. .Regards
