to ALL re: DISK CLEANUP TIP

 Heh.
 I needed to clean up my system disk. I had about 350 programs in it,
i.e. little (and some not so little) utilities, bat files, etc.
 I was trying to figure how to clean it up without removing something
important or having to stare at each name.
 I finally decided to create an .\unused subdir under the directory
(called \sys\bin), and move all my files to it, then move back the
ones I KNOW I use a lot.
 The first day, I kept getting errors as things I use weren't there -
so I popped into TREEVIEW to move what was missing back.
 The next day only a few showed up - fewer and fewer each day.
 So now, I've got about 75 files in my directory, and 275 in the
.\unused directory!
 Seems to be working out just fine!

Sounds good - but what if you had two progams with the same name?
Then you'd still have the second one, but.! Of course, I expect you
keep backups :-). My solution to staring at file names is to
use 4DOS's description function so that I have a description
for all of my files that are 'non-obvious' - \bin\util,
\bin\graphics, etc. The description comes up when I do DIR,
and is also present if I use select del (*.*) to do some up-
cleaning.

01 ?  > What if you had two programs with the same name?
02 ?  I don't get it.  How could I?  I moved ALL my executable utilties
03 ?down to a \sys\bin\unused, then move 'em back as I need 'em.
04 ?  matter of fact I wrote a little "I.bat" that looks first for a .COM,
05 ?then a .EXE, then a .BAT, and if finding one, moves it back from
06 ?...unused to \sys\bin.
07 ?  You say your solution is to use 4DOS's description function -
08 ?my problem isn't that I don't know what they are - it is that it
09 ?would be a big process to sort thru 300 executable programs trying to
10 ?decide which you really use.  With my trick, if you try to use it,
11 ?you have to "bring it back" from the ...\unused directory.
12 ?  Actually, I have MEGABYTES to clean up on another system - but
13 ?it is not a matter of not knowing what it is, it is a matter of
14 ?trying to decide what to keep.  I have a large neough hard disk that
15 ?I've become a pack rat - I have Turbo C, 1.0, 20, Turbo C++, Borland
16 ?C++, etc.  Actually, the only one I use it Turbo C 2.0, so I'm
17 ?wondering if I should just "Blow the others away".  But then again
18 ?might be nice to keep 'em around in case I "grow" into C++..
