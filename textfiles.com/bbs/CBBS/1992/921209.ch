to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/HP LASERJET4 & TRUETYPE

 I'm not that up on True Type, but ATM is not a "font" when it gets to the
printer, just a bit-stream. The fonts are scaled, filled in, and rastorized
to the printer. Thus I think Tru-Type would be the same - which if true
would result in the answer you got - that "no, trutype is not downloadable".

Msg 45940 is 04 line(s) on 12/08/92 from DENNIS STAHL
to ALL re: CARDINAL CLONE - DRDOS VS. DOS

Scenario. Clone machine (Happens to be a Cardinal) XT processor
with DRDOS installed on hard drive.
Question. Can I pop a DOS 3.3 diskette in and just format and sys
the hard drive, or is there more to do?
