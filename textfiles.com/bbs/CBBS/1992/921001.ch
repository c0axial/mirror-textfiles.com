to STEVE BOGOLUB re: CACHE REUNION

 Gee, sorry, didn't mean to not include you - just quick whipped up a
few names of folks I'd talked or who had been on CBBS recently.
 What do you think of the idea of a reunion? Yours is the first comment
on it (and for those who are "reading over our shoulder" Steve wondered
if he was too late, and the answer is no, since I'd not heard from
anyone at all!
 P.S. nice to have you back!

to GLEN PARK re: INVIZOBOBBLE

 If CBBS was not echoing what you were typing, then you probably were
"experimenting" by typing different things without knowing what they do,
or a line glitch or typo caused you to key the (now obsolete, but still
there) "D" command, which switches you into half-duplex, a mode whereby
YOUR TERMINAL program or modem echo characters so you don't want CBBS to
do so also.
 Sorry for the problems. Stop back, jump in the conversations. What
are you running, what are you "into"?

to ALL re: C-SET/2 ARRIVED

 Just going thru an install of C-set/2, the 32-bit programming environment
for OS/2. I did a show once where I ran the "station" for C-set 2, and it
was sufficiently interesting that I ordered it. Working on the install now.

to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/OVERNIGHT

 Thanks for the input, Eric. I'll pass it along. For what it's worth,
I've already told him that I've left my machine on 24 hours (except for
the monitor) for no less than eight months, and it doesn't make an
impression on him. UL approval doesn't, either, and that's part of his
livelihood; he should understand that. Finally, having known me since the
fifth grade, he should be able to trust my instincts, especially when I
can back it up with my own computer usage, my 25 years of electronics
experience (professional only; amateur goes back farther), etc. etc.
He just won't be persuaded. Unfortunately, I've agreed to this job for a
fixed price, so I can't change his mind that way either.

to MURRAY ARNOW re: BOOKS

 After being too busy for too long to look up the references you gave
during our monitor/CRT/electron-microscope/etc. discussion of last year,
I finally went out and had the library run some of the references. The
books were INCREDIBLY hard to find; took two months to get them.
 "Color Television Picture Tubes" was a tome, but very, VERY informative.
Much of what I read there was absolute news to me; construction details,
research over the "ages", ideas, ideas, ideas. Never made it through the
whole book. I'll have to try to get my own copy of it.
 The "Handbook of Vacuum devices." book was also incredibly fascinating.
Looking at what was in there, I found that glass discolors not only because
of the continual X-ray bombardment, but also just because of electron
bombardment! Noted also that electron bombardment causes outgassing; very
interesting, and certainly explains the presence of the getter. Heck,
just the first few pages were informative; I always thought "Pyrex" glass
was impervious to sudden heat changes (as I was instructed in high school),
and found in, no less, a FOOTNOTE that the term Pyrex is used to refer to
over 150 types of glass composition.
 All in all, I can't say enough in one long, boring message about the
books to which you referred us last year. I just hope I can find my own
copies of them and put them to some study. Unfortunately, these are my
last few days with them; because of State cuts in Library funds, anything
that doesn't exist in an SLS library could cost $10 as a retrieval fee,
just to get the two-week loan.
 In case you didn't notice, I've kept all the messages we exchanged back
then and am using them as instructional materials.

to ALL re: DISK FORMAT SOFTWARE

 Because of some repairs I had to make at the local public library on
their PS/2-30 systems (intentional and very skillful damage to software),
I'm currently looking for code, preferably assembly code, to deal with the
floppy disk controllers of today and use them to create weird, undecipherable
formats for disks which the librarians would loan for use of the computers.
Does anyone know of any sources for such information? Some sample code in
assembler would be preferred, but any and all help would be appreciated.
 The most notable thing about the damage was that it was done by a "young
person" (read: 15-year-old), and it was done with great skill. They
somehow not only removed the system files from the disk, they managed to
put the \DOS directory in cluster 2 (where, of course, IO.SYS or IBMBIO.COM
usually reside), and do other things that I thought were beyond the skills
of the average hacker. I'm trying to goof-proof their systems for them,
gratis, of course.
 Book recommendations would be nice, but in my present unemployed state
I might not be able to access those books.

to ALL re: GOOF-PROOFING SYSTEMS

 I'm trying to make the systems at my local library as cracker-proof as
I can manage. One idea I've had is to make the systems unreadable by most
all software, by munging the partition tables of the hard drives and forcing
the use of a floppy to get the system on-line; of course, in order to get
the system running, the person would have to enter a valid SLS Inter-library
code.
 I'm open to any and all ideas. To express a few initial ideas of my own,
I've thought about forcing the use of a specially-formatted floppy to gett
the hard drive on-line, and to load a device driver which would prevent
hard drive access without proper authorization. Etc. Etc.
 The long and short of it is, I'd like to have them be able to loan their
computers to people with confidence that they won't end up with several
directories full of data deleted, the operating system removed from the HD,
etc.
 ANY and ALL ideas are DEFINITELY appreciated.

I've been using both Memorex Telex and IBM domestically. However, as the
Qty. of PCs contine to increase, my maintenance budget has gone thru the
ceiling. As a result, I'm looking for other alternatives.

to ALL re: COMPUTERS AVAILABLE (MAYBE)

 As I was talking to the Schiller Park Library staff yesterday, it came
up that there are "several" computers (at this time, type unknown) in their
basement, gathering dust, because no one knows how to use them. The staff
was VERY receptive to donating them to a worthy cause, and I've seen all
too many messages in the past year asking for used computer donations to help
the handicapped, etc. Just in case I see anything worth salvaging when I
hit their basement today, does anyone know of any WORTHY causes (they have
to be worthier than "The Cliff Sharp Computer Foundation") that could use a
computer or two, in working condx, no matter how obsolete?

What is the difference between 16550 and the 16550AFN UART chip an
and how will affect me if I own 386-33 or 25mhz. I'm considering buying
V.32 BIS/HST modem perferably an external.
