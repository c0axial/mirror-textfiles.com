 The trick to storing the DJ cart's seems to be preventing them from
drying out, without actually touching the nozzle. I'd be inclined to
see about maybe some kind of humidity-supplying container if the "real
thing" can't be found or made.
 Yes, I "think" I've seen the color recharge kits, but I don't recall
the details. I'll try to check my stored deskjet threads from Compuserve.

I have been playing with ways of making a Toshiba 1600 with 1 meg ram and
a 20 meg hard drive usable i todays software world. Toshiba only offered
a 20 or 40 with this particular machine. I have also noticed that almost
all manufacturers do not load the drive type tables in the BIOS and do not
allow a user definable selecttion.
 This particular machine has a 20 meg conner in it (IDE 3020 I believe)
I should be able to put any IDE drive in to the space provided
and if nothing else, get the first 20 meg.
 Now, if one would use ontrack disk software ( sort of outdated with dos
4.0 , 5.0), you can set up any physical drive to be accessed via the
table setting in BOIS. While toshiba was of no help, Ontrack said
that I should be able to pull this off, at least via software.
 Has anyone else tried this, or heard of doing this ???

I have been looking at the LJ4 and have called HP in an attempt to get a
handle on the truetype world. First as I see it, truetype basically pr
provides a subset of the functionality of postscript, being scalable fonts
only. No graphic processing is set it in.
 I asked HP if additional truetype fonts could be downloaded into the
printer. Their response was 'no', that truetype was not downloadable, and
that I could either add cartridges with the fonts, or use something like
ATM to convert from truetype to bit mapped graphic data and print that.
Can someone seperate fact from fiction here ????

to WARD/ANDY re: R?DJ500 PROBLEM (!)

The cable is an off-the-shelf one I got from Elektek at the same time
I bought my DJ500 there. Because I was able print so many pages before
the problem sprung up, I thought maybe static was the problem. All
those pages rubbing on the platten, maybe. (The cable mentioned above
is a six-foot parallel.) Since the DJ works fine with the serial
port, I'm not sure I want to risk having anyone monkey with it even
though it's under warranty. ("If you're not sure it's broke, you're
not sure you should fix it," as they say.)

Have you considered disk compression software? If you can put a 40
Meg disk in there, then you could use SuperStore (sp?) or something
like that to gain a lot more space (of course, 20 will get you 40,
too.). If things go right, you'd be able to load the software
above 640, and you'd be set. Note that, since most processors run
PDQ, there's really no operations penalty - it's faster to decompress
stuff than it is to load it off the disk! I've been using DRDOS
(with built-in SUPERSTOR) for most of the past year, and I've had
no apparent slowdown.
