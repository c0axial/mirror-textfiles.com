about 3 pounds).
  P.S. Please, no pen pal, Commodore, etc msgs!  And use your right name!
Ann Pelz?  Signed by Brandon Ellison?  c'mon!

to ALL re: DJ500 MEMORY CARTRIDGE?

Elektek is asking $129 for a 256K memory cartridge for the DJ 500.  That
seems a little stiff.  Is there a second source for Desk Jet memory
cartridges?  Thanks.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: GRANDVIEW OUTLINER

Been spending a lot of time building outlines in Grandview and
 - a new toy - Lotus Notes.  I've given up on Personal Info Managers
and gone back to outliners.  I REALLY like the new version 2.0 of
Grandview and will write a review of Notes.  You still love Grandview??

to ALL re: BASIC COMMUNICATIONS

I need help using communication commands in GWBASIC. My manual doesn't
describe how to use the commands for using my modem in BASIC and I
can't figure out how to use them. They are :
COM(1) on       OPEN "COM(1)" as 1      GET  a,b        PUT a,b
How do I use them and are there any subroutines I  can use with them
to transmit and recieve?

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/WINDOWS PROBLEM

We ran into another interesting Windows mystery recently.  After running
Intermission we tried to remove it to load After Dark.  After Dark
says that it won't load because Intermission is running and you can't
have two screen blankers.  Removed all references to Intermission in
WIN.INI, killed it dead, removed it, deleted it from the disk, etc.  After
Dark still won't install.  After Dark folks claim it's Norton's Desktop,
Norton's folk say no.  Nobody knows....
No dup. chars.
