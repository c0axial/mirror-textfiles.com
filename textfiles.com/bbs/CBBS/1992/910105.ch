  Simple - an "empty" Deskjet Cartridge is about 1 oz, a full one about 1.6+,
so you can best use a postal scale to see when a refill is needed -
  When it is needes, about 6 cc of Skrip black is injected into the hole
in the top (a 2" needle is best - goes down into the foam block in the
catrridge).  Voila!

to ALL re: DATE OF COMDEX

I know Comdex is coming to Chiacgo this spring, sometime in April.
Does anyone know the exact date ???

Msg 45391 is 06 line(s) on 01/05/92 from DENNIS DUFFNER
to SHANE VINCENT re: C FOR THE AMIGA

Any Amiga board in the area(check the Stillwaters list) will have several
PD C ompilers.  I have NorthC here and it's not bad.  There are some
libs that are lacking and those you're stuck without.

What you MIGHT consider is Lattice5.2 for the Amiga.  Dunno the cost,
but it's the slickest C compiler around.

Msg 45392 is 04 line(s) on 01/05/92 from BENJAMIN COHEN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/PARALLEL TAPE DRIVE?

I think that's the correct size, DC-600 or something like that.  It's about
the size of an audio cassette, but has an off center notch in the back.
Oddly, the 160MB systems would allow the tape to be inserted backwards!
It wouldn't work, but you could put it in.

Msg 45393 is 01 line(s) on 01/05/92 from BENJAMIN COHEN
to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/DATE OF COMDEX

April 6 through 9 at McCormick Place.

Msg 45394 is 03 line(s) on 01/05/92 from BENJAMIN COHEN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/SCALABLE FONTS

Well, from what I hear the Windows driver doesn't support the
scalable fonts!  I haven't had a chance to try it, but I
suppose I must one of these days.
No dup. chars.
