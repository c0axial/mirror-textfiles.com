to BENJAMIN COHEN re: R/TELEBIT QBLAZER MODEM

Thanx for the info. I had used the QBlazer for a trial period and liked
it very much. I decided to return it because it did not have all the
features I may want in the future. I had noticed that I could
trade my old USR HST in for a new model for just a few $ more and
have the ability to upgrade in the future if things change.
I appreciate your comments about the QBlazer.

Msg 45754 is 06 line(s) on 09/28/92 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to ALL re: QUESTIONS ABOUT DOS 4

I don't have a copy of DOS 4, but I need two items of information to
complete a utility program that displays the DOS errorlevel for DOS 3+:
 1) What is the exact offset (from 0H, not 100H) of the byte in
 DOS 4's COMMAND.COM that holds the current errorlevel?
 2) What are the first three bytes of DOS 4's COMMAND.COM (at 100H)?
Thanks.

  There's also a "crcfast" that uses a pre-computed table to do the
CRC.  Also there's a CRC routine that uses it on the Ward Board (708)
849-1132, in one of the low #'d msgs, like msybe 7 or so?
  Basically a CRC is the remainder when a message, treated as a HUGE
number (128 byte msg = 128 x 8 bits = 1024 bit long NUMBER) divided by
a polynomial like x^16+x^15+x^2+1.  However, it can be computed by shifting
a bit at a time and doing XORs and other tricks; then others have figured
how to do it 8-bits at a time (instead of a loop shifting each bit in a
byte).  Actually I don't undersatnd it as well as it may already sound,
and cannot elaborate on what I've already said.
