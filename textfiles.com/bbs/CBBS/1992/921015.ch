 Sorry, Randy doesn't call in here any more (compared to chinet, it
is "boring").
 I don't THINK any non-contributor has access to the internet, but I'll
pass your msg along to him when I call chinet this evening.

 I know it isn't all that fast (because of local echoing of the screen)
but is 9600 working OK for you? At CBBS' 12th or so anniversary, USR gave
me two HST 9600s, one for CBBS, one for me. Randy "usurped" one when
CBBS died, and I had to give mine up to get CBBS going again, so I can
no longer get in over 2400, and am just wondering if it is OK.
 Thanks!

9600 is working fine for me.
