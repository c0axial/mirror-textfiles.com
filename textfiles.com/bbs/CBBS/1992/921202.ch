]Ward,
A quick question:  for the past several months I have been
getting a lot of line noise when I call.  I have changed speed and
switched modems, to no avail.  I have no problems when calling other
boards.  I have found that I have the same problem with a board in
the
777 excahnge which is the same as 545. I called the phone compnay
2 times and they claim to have checked all 9 trunks from highland
park to chicago.  Yet when I call, even when the modem was not answering
I could hear a clicking or chatter in the ring tone I got
from the phone company?
Any idea on how to proceed.  ???If you are actually located in the
545 prefix maybe we could try a voice line and see how the noise level
is.   My home # is 708-432-1070

 Were you in CACHE way back when? Think there would be an interest
in getting some of the "old timers" together for a 15th year CACHE
reunion? Actually, maybe I should consolidate CBBS's 15th anniversary
party (Barnaby's on Touhy, 2:00 PM, Sat Feb 13) with a CACHE reunion!
 Hope you can join us.

 What flavor of X-windows are you working with? If I remember correctly
RS-6000's use Motif. I've done alot of work using OpenLook, although this
project is using IXI/Motif for the GUI.
 Have you done any work with the Interface Builders for X ?
 I'm currently working on Sun Workstations, using a SPARC IPX. I've also
done some work on NeXT machines recently.
 I'll let you know about the sound card as soon as I get it. Should be
towards the end of this week. It would be nice to store old vinyl discs
on my computer, but they have to first come up with a compression system.
Audio files still seem to take up alot of space.
 I'm already looking forward to the pizza party!

Ward,
 Yep! I remember going to the gas company on was it SHrmer
road ??? I think I may even be able to dig up a couple of old
newsletters if anyone would be interested. ( I think I saw a small file
of CACHE stuff when I moved)?
 As for the re-union, I think it sounds great. I already
marked it in my book.

 OK, got to figure some way to get folks aware of it - I think I'll find
a listing - lets see, should be '77 to be 15 years ago - or mebbe just about
anyone who wants to come, from then or more recent.
 As to your questions about line noise, no, sorry, I'm not in that area,
I'm 30 miles south of CBBS.
 What I did one day when I had that problem, was to talk to Randy Suess,
and we got the little clicks on our voice line, so I just left the phone
off the hook while going to another phone line to call the phone company.
 Actually, I'd arranged it in advance - i.e. said I had a problem, they
said to call back if I ever isolated it. Well, I did, and they took a
while, but traced it down to a faulty multiplexor and took it out of
service pending repair.
 Dunno if Randy's gotten this modem changed over, but it seems it wasn't
going MNP. And tonight when I called at 2400, I got garbage then a
disconnect, then noticed it said "connect 1200". Hmmm. I KNOW I set the
speed to 2400 when I do the ATA. Anyway, I switched to 1200, called back,
and got in.
 Hopefully I'll have time to get the HST repaired, then we can go MNP again.

to WARD re: MODEM SIGNALS

Actually, CTS has become more important than ever, since it's how a modem
tells the computer "hold on and let me catch my breath" when you're running
the computer-to-modem link faster than the modem-to-modem link. I've never
met a modem that didn't use DSR, though I've also never met one that used it
for anything other than to inform the computer that the modem was powered up.
It's possible that some DIP-switch or NVRAM setting was causing the modem
not to generate those signals (I've explained to people more times than I
care to remember why it's necessary to configure a modem to have DCD follow
the state of the connection, rather than stay on all the time, in order to
use most terminal programs' dialing directories).

to ALL re: DJ500 PROBLEM (!)

 I have a problem with my DeskJet 500. Since problems with the DJ are
so rare, I thought I publish a note here. Maybe someone will also have
a remedy.
 I've been using a serial cable with the DJ for about nine months and
have had no problems. A few days ago, I switched to a parallel cable,
bought new. In printing a long document, the DJ started out by printing
fine. But I noticed later that it had printed a spurious "$" on pages 70,
86, 116, (two of them on) 160, and 176. When I individually reprinted
the pages, one of the pages again featured a renegade "$" (in a different
spot than before).
 I called Elektek, and a techie there said he had a problem like this
with his DJ, and he cured it by removing the clips that secure the parallel
cable connector to the DJ. Sounds like voodoo technomatics to me.
 Has anyone else encountered this problem?

to ALL re: TELCO QUESTION

I recently received a notice (via bulk mail) from ma bell saying that I h
have been receiving touch tone service without being charged for
it. The notice went on to saythat for xx cents a month I could
continue it. One of their telemarketers left a message to the
same effect on my answering machine today. The question: does the
telco really have the ability to switch their equipment so that it
won't recognize my modem and pulse-tone switchable tones?

Msg 45924 is 23 line(s) on 12/02/92 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/DJ500 PROBLEM (!)

I would suspect the cable - specificlly, I would suspect the
shielding. I had a printer buffer that worked right for years
with an OKI'92 printer. Then, when I upgraded to a DJ500, I noticed
all sorts of things like you've mentioned - UGH. Removing the buffer
cleaned things up. You don't mention what speed you had the serial
connection at; the problem may be that you're now running at VERY high
speed: Parallel ports do that, especially given the 16K buffer in the
DJ500. At high speeds (like my buffer pumping things ito the DJ on-board
buffer), things get dicey. My buffer was hooked to the printer via
a (built-in) short ribbon cable. Removing the buffer fixed everything.
It may be the case that your cable isn't properly shielding things, and
the result is that on high-speed prints (the first 16K or so) you get
junk. On reviewing your message, I see the problems occurred later.
Since I don't know the DJ as wel as Ward (HEY! WARD!), it seems to
me that the DJ could still be getting stuff in "bursts" at that point,
and so you could still hav troubles.

End of story: try a new parallel cable - preferrably a nic, high-end,
VERY well-shielded one. Bet that solves your problem.

(OH - a thought - perhaps shielding is more important w/DJ because
of the 'spark' (RFI source) used in printing???)
