  What do you think the next year will show?
  Will we have a 486/50 with a 100mhz internal clock?
  Will AMD others come out with more powerful 386s or some other chip
to compete with Intel?

  What will happen? hat COULD depend on the political scene. If Bush
messes things up with Japan other Far East countries might go for broke
for exporting all they can. I would think many items will have bargan
prices even though sifting thru the names of them will be a headache.
No dup. chars.
