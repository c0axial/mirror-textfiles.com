to ALL re: CACHE REUNION?

 Anyone think it would be interesting to try to get together folks
from the OLD CACHE organization - say late 70's, early 80's? It could
be a 15-year reunion maybe based upon old lists. Lets see, Roy Lipscomb,
Gerry Swetsky, Bill Precht, Rob't Swartz, Lloyd Smith, Bill B. (The NI
Gas Guy), etc? Wonder how successful it would be.

Thanks for your help on this. I really appreciate it.

Msg 45734 is 08 line(s) on 09/18/92 from AL HIGGINS
to ALL re: PC MAINTENANCE PRICING

I have the responsibility for putting PCs under national maint.
agreements for the firm I work for. Is there anyone out there
who has the same type of responsibility, and can tell me what
firms they are using for maintaining their PCs?? We are not
toooo happy with the company we are using, and are thinking
of changing providing we can find someone who is cost competitive,
and can support PCs in ALL 50 es on a four hour response.
Any comments would be appreciated!
