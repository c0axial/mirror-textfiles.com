 Yes, it is nice to be back - and to have you back! Contribute? Ya!
What we need is some "message topics" to bring on the threads (to use
the term loosely - CBBS doesn't currently support "threads" i.e. keeping
track of replies - but you can use summary commands to read all msgs of
a given topic).
 I think I'll start with the next msg - about CD ROMS.

Msg 45740 is 16 line(s) on 09/22/92 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: CD-ROMS

 Any thoughts about CD-ROMS? I see many bundled with their own controllers -
are many of them SCSI? I have an IN-2000 SCSI controller, but might like
to go for a faster one and one supported by OS/2 such as an Adaptec -
lets see (scratching head). 1542B? Then the ROM itself: OS/2 only
supports IBM and Toshiba, though "some" others work by patching the name
of the drive mfgr into the support module.
 I'd like music, and I'd like NOT to buy in on the "trailing edge" of
an era - sounds like the double-speed, or even quad-speed CDs are right
here now, though not completely taking over the market.
 Lets put OS/2 out of the picture for now - Just windows (currently 3.0,
but with 3.1 on the shelf). What drive would work on my IN-2000?
 Thanks!
 P.S. lets get some messages going here! I sure would appreciate it!
I know with all the outages, CBBS will never see 50 calls a day again on
its one line, but perhaps we can get a bit of "critical mass" to keep it
alive as a piece of working history! Thanks!

Msg 45741 is 20 line(s) on 09/24/92 from JERRY OLSEN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/CD-ROMS

I just wrote an article about multimedia-related hardware, including
CD-ROM drives. This was for a shareware mag, so I didn't look at the
high end. OTOH, I disregarded the true low end too. I focused upon
those that were fully compatible with Win 3.0 with MM extensions and
3.1. The hands-down winner was Sony's CDU535. (Among the best sources
I found was FastMICRO. About #350 to the door, very fast service,
a sales staff which knew what it was doing, etc.

BTW, I too am very glad you're back up, not only because this has
been my favorite BBS since my first modem in the early '80s (well,
except for my own BBS, of course <G>) but also because I slipped
this phone number into an article about shareware's first decade.
(Remember that we spoke briefly about that a couple of months ago?)
That article is turning into my most-sold piece ever-in the U.S.,
U.K., Australia and Canada. (The latter is a mainstream pub, but
they still were interested.) Also, some writer in Texas wants to
excerpt the section about CBBS and MODEM/XMODEM this week.So you
may get a healthy number of additional callers as a result.

Regards.

Ward:

 Thanx for the info. Decided not to get the QBlazer. I took US
Robotics on their offer of a trade in on a new DS 16.8K. The cost
was a few $ more and I gained a great deal of compatability.
