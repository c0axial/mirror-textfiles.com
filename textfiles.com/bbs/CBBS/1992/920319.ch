to JIM POLOUS re: R/BASIC COMMUNICATIONS

  Jim (& Gerry): I found a problem with a basica program that uses
the input$ of loc(n) - if n > 255, then too long a string is input,
and it blows up.  Problem is, you want to put in as few instructions
as possible - I've not tried this, but perhaps you could do an input
of loc(1) and 255 - so it would never exceed 255.  Dunno what happens
if it hits a 0 though - may be yet another error.

to MARTY DIPPEL re: CHINET LOGIN

i've tried getting on chinet this morning, and although i've logged in
as myself previously t0o get a password, the moment the word "password"
appears on the screen, everything goes greek.  i can see bits and pieces buried
in the text such as chinet and version, but 81N and 71E as well as protocol
and baud seem to have no evvect.  (effect?)  p.s.

leave a message if you are willing.
