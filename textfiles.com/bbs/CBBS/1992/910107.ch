to BENJAMIN COHEN re: R/PARALLEL TAPE DRIVE?

  Ooh, I'm hoping the parallel tape doesn't use the "audio cassette" type
of tape - but then again...
  In my "history", my first drive took DC-1000s, those were 1/8" tape in
a 3M cartridge, about the size of a cassette.  Then I went to a 20M
cassette drive - with the offset notch like you said - CT-500 and CT-500H
were the tape numbers.  Then I got a Colorado Jumbo "120" (the quotes,
because it is a 60M tape, they're "hoping" for double, via compression),
for my communications system.  My "big" system then went to a DC-300 and
DC-600 type BIG CARTRIDGE drive - but only 60M (bought it used for $250).
  SO, almost no matter what tapes the parallel drive uses, I'm hoping
I might have some tapes.
  We got approval for the parallel tape drive, I'm hoping they ordered
it and it will come in fairly soon.  I'm TIRED OF DISKETTES!

Hello,

Does anyone here know the phone number to the Stillwaters BBS?

I am trying to compile a list of BBS numbers in my 'A' calling range, as
I have Centel and calls outside of A cost 5 cents a minute!!

Thank you,

Steve

to SHANE VINCENT re: R/C FOR AMIGA

As you can see I do not call BBSs' very often! Yes,though -in answer to your
question- I do have an Amiga (500). To use a PD 'C' compiler effectively
you will also need the complete 'INCLUDE' files (and other text material)
which can be obtained from Commodore, but more readily from the June/July issue
of the AMIGA WORLD TECH JOURNAL (with DISK!). Alternatively -and/or in supporst
-you can use a book such as 'MAPPING THE AMIGA' (by Anderson & Thompson) which
provides offsets for all library functions and, in addition, lists all STRUCT=
URES with numeric offsets of the parameters. Using offset numbers for function
and parameter values is probably not the best way to go (though, as a struggl-
ing Assembly code pgm'r, I do!). Leave a msg, letting me know of your
success/failure in getting this stuff. Incidentally, there is a third 'C'
compiler (PD) on a recent Fred Fish disk. It is by Matt Dillon, who surely is
one of the most knowledgeable of Amiga pgm'rs. It is SHAREWARE however, and
costs about 40-50 bucks. Don't recall which FF# disk.

I don't off-hand have the number for Stillwaters, but the list they
coordinate is one of several available on a BBS I run. If interested,
details to direct you through the procedures are provided on your first
call: The Advocate/NoWar, 312.939.4411, 24 hrs., 8/n/1, 300-2400 bps
(Loop area).

  What is the best book for learning C syntax for someone
with a strong programming background?

Msg 45400 is 02 line(s) on 01/07/92 from BENJAMIN COHEN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/PARALLEL TAPE DRIVE?

No, it's not an audio cassette, but it's the size and shape of an
audio cassette, except for the notch.

Msg 45401 is 10 line(s) on 01/07/92 from BENJAMIN COHEN
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/SCALABLE FONTS

Following up on my prior message:

The info file on the Windows printer driver for the LQ-570, LQ-870,
LQ-1070, LQ-1170, AP-5000, and AP-5500 says:
  "Due to Microsoft's new font standard of not supporting printer
   resident fonts, Windows does not use the scalabale fonts feature
   of the new Epson printers."
I haven't gotten any further, but I suppose that it means that to
scale fonts it goes into graphics mode.  I suppose if you want slow,
you get Windows.....

Msg 45402 is 03 line(s) on 01/07/92 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to BOB SULLIVAN re: R/BEST C SYNTAX BOOK

Probably "The C programming language" by Kernighan and Ritchie.  It's basically
the horse's mouth on the language (and prior to the adoption of the ANSI
standard, it was THE definition of the language).

Msg 45403 is 12 line(s) on 01/07/92 from STEPHEN SVIATKO
to ALL re: BULLETIN BOARDS

Hello,

I am looking for the number of the Stillwaters BBS.  If anyone knows it
(come on, just about everyone has the list, right?) please leave it to me
in E-mail or in a message or whatever..

To Jerry Olsen:  Thanks for the recommendation to call your board, but
no thanks.  I believe (if I read the instructions on your board right)
that you require a donation in order to get access to any of the files
(including your stillwaters list!).  Sorry.....
