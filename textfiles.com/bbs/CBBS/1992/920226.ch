]Thanks for the program. I am using it right now except that I customized
it a bit. I added a cursor and a printing option. I made a cursor by
making line 50 read :
50 PRINT #1,X$;"_";CHR$(29);
I made it print by using a flag to send it to a seperate subroutine
that used an LPRINT to print the info when I press ctrl-P and stops
when I press ctrl-O. I am working on a capture option. I prefer it
to the comm. program that was supplied in Deskmate for my computer.
I can load it up in 3 seconds and Deskmate takes at least a minute.
The only problem is though is that it makes an annoying buzz whenever
I press return. Why is that?

  No, the double-life cartridge is much more simple - instead of the ink
being in a foam block - where the foam takes quite a bit of the "space",
it is a bladder - 100% ink, not 50% foam, 50% ink.  At least that's what
I heard.
  P.S. as to the RAM cartridge, what are you going to use for a
Helvetica font?  The cartridge itself is NOT useful (that's one of the
reasons I offered it ;-) without a soft font package, purchased from HP
or from others such as Gary Elfring.
  What software are you going to use to drive it if not a Windows appl?
The complexity of proportional-spaced fonts means you need software that
explicitly drives the DeskJet.
  Windiws on a 640K original AT?  Right, Windows 3 at least, would kill it.
  ---
  Speaking of half-the-ink, as you were in your msg, I think the only thing
like that is the "draft" button, which causes every-other-dot (horizontally)
to be skipped.  This causes default Courier to look about like a slightly-
used ribbon would print on a good 24-pin printer.  (it isn't that great
for 6-point font, because the line widths are too narrow - you can't
afford to drop 1/2.  BUT draft mode IS more economical for just its name
sake - draft.  (or listings, etc).  Many people wish there were a switch
to default to draft.

Would be intrested if there are anothers intrested in this subject.
Have been looking to a voice response board, but haven't found
any sales people who know even what I'm talking about. I have an
option of picking up a Dialogic board but they are $$$$ as
apposed to others that are out on the market.....

for what it's worth I just picked up a couple of the larger ink cartridges
at ET the other day. I went through the other cartridges in 2-3 wks each.
I've learned to print in draft till I'm ready for the final print. Will
let you know how long the new cartridge works. The price as arround $23+ for
for the double, and $17 or $18 for a single. Hope prices come down soon!

Sure.

    fprintf(stdout, "Babble, chatter");  /* output to screen, redirectable
                                            via the '>' and '<' */

    fprintf(stderr, "Ouch! It broke!");  /* output to the error device,
                                            typically the screen */

You can find this stuff in any C manual.

If the high-capacity cartridge uses a bladder instead of foam,
I wonder--
1)  Why they used foam in the first place.
2)  If the high-capacity cartridge is re-inkable.
.
I plan to use a shareware downloadable font.
By the way, the package came today.  Nice labels!  Thanks again.
