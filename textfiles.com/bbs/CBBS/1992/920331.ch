Does anyone know the nearest Ilink echo to Chicago without access
charges? The nearest I've located is in Knoxville, TN :-(

Thanks for the info Ward.  Now that you mention it, I had heard of that
center but had forgotten about it.  The time is coming up for our next trip
to the Bangkok isn't it?

If anybody is in the handicapped... there is a Commodore word processor that
will speak as it prints to the screen. It is written by the brain of
Eric Lee which produced one of the finest word processor's I have ever
seen on any computer. Why haven't others stolen his ideas yet is beyond
me. I hope he makes a MS-DOS or UNIX version soon, but I doubt it.

When is the Full Command going to be listed? I bet 95% of the people
who call here doesn't even know that it is here.

I have a communication program you could use.  Just leave a message
here letting me know what bulletin board you want me to upload it
to.  This bulletin board doesn't have any file upload/download.
I'll look for your message.

Msg 45567 is 10 line(s) on 03/30/92 from NEAL SOSNOWSKI
to ALL re: WORDPERFECT FOR WINDOWS

is wordperfect for windows any easier for a novice to learn
than wordperfect 5.1?
this assumes that the novice has access to windows and a
very fast ibm clone.
so the only consideration is the learning curve of windows and
worperfect for windows vs
the learning curve for wordperfect 5.1.
are there any experience users with an opinion?
thanks in advance.

    I have just finished putting together a YASBEC (Yet Another Single Board
Eight Bit Computer).  Haven't had this much fun since assembling my first
NorthStar!  I know it doesn't 'DO WINSDOWS' or other graphically neat
software, but for sheer enjoyment and pride of ownership, nothing comes
close!     Mired in CP/M and loving it...
No dup. chars.
