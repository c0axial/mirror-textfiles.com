HP does provide some sample paper with the the 500C, however, it is a grade
or two above the typical zerox copy paper. When using that type of paper
the 500C has a tendency to bleed a litle. It work well for draft, so I
only use the GOOD stuff when I'm doing my final cut! As for quality, I
great!

Don't feel bad! I was to a point where I had imported some color
graphics into a WP5.1 text file, to learn the copy of 5.1 Deskjet
drived did not support color. So, WP sent me some updated drives,
guess what they didn't work either. The next suggestion from WP
was to upgrade to WP with windows! I'm upgraded to windows, and
now I'm told I have to use the Deskjet drivers within windows to
drive the 500C. Now all my documentation is written in Times Roman fonts
So I'll have to figure out how to sellect the fonts in PM for the
TMRM font cartridge.... And to think three weeks ago all i had to do
is plug it in and go!
Speeking of CORDEL Draw, I saw an unbeleivable competive upgrade....
If you use Cordel Draw, Adobe Illustrator, Afus Freehand, Gem Artline,
Harvard Draw, or Micrographics Designer, you can receive a CORDEL Draw
upgrade for $595 INCLUDING>>>>> CD-Audio, CD Library of the future, Tales
of Mistry, the CD-Rom drive, a videotape to install it  and CORDEL Draw
I called COREL and the offer is good for at least 30 days..... Sure makes one
