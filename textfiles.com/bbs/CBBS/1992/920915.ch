 Anyone have experience with these drives? Specifically, I went from
a 120 to a 250, and I'm getting way too many errors on the 250M tapes-
on the order of 300, to as many as 1400. I just bought a new 3M 2120
tape, and will format it to see how it does.
 Thanks for any ideas.

 I have now sent off my order for the IBM workframe and Cset/2
compiler. Got the books - WHEW! 47 pounds! Actually a friend (Mike
Warot) liked 'em so well he bought 'em off of me and I ordered another
set of 'em.

Ward, Ill let you know when I get my
Workset/2. I guess now that you've got me curious, I'll have to
weigh it when it gets here.and I thought MSC+7.0 & the SDK was a lot
of docs. (I'm working my way back up to long message lines (:-}.) Bye

 Puzzled.Aha! I found out what it is - because I saw a bracket-D in the
log. You're sending VT-100 escape sequences (or ANSI or something).
Try hitting your REAL backspace key - should send a ^H, not an esc-
bracket-D.

to PHIL SCHUMAN re: THANKS

 Thanks for dropping by.wonder what you're "into" these days.
If I were to characterize what I'm "into", it would be this:
 - HP Deskjet (Color) - with Corel Draw, etc.
 - Colorado Jumbo tape drive (switched from 120 to 250 - 250 seems
 MUCH more sensitive to tape quality - older tapes getting 300 or more
 errors (one even over 1400!) while a new tape got 30 some.
 - Still like my OLD Toshiba T1000 XE notebook - only 20M, but big
 enough to do CBBS development in Turbo C, run Foxbase, Quattro Pro, etc.
 - Interested in color scanning and image processing - can't seem to keep
 up with the latest in color retouching programs, etc.

I am researching a technical paper on MNP modem protocols. I have some basic
data on the overview of each of the 10 levels, but need to get to the next l
level of technical details for this paper. Does anyone know where I may find
a reference manual,etc. on perhaps MNP 5 data compression techniques, etc.
I have tried to speak to tech support at Microcom directly but they did not
seem to have any leads. Any help in the right direction would be really
appreciated.

to ALL re: WELCOME! & THANKS!

 It does my heart good to see callers right off the bat when CBBS came
back on line - reinforces my gut feel that it should be here! I couldn't
believe when, after being down for months, within minutes of going back
up, there was a caller! My heartfelt thanks! Please pass on the word
- especially to old CBBSers.
 Any suggestions welcome! I think CBBS will stay kind of as it is for
now, but with development going on in C for portability to a native
PC environment, or Unix, etc. (*)
 (*) It is currently running on a PC with a V20 chip that supports
8080 emulation! With a bunch of assembler hacks, I've interfaced between
CP/M 8080 code and the 8086 assembler interrupts, etc.
