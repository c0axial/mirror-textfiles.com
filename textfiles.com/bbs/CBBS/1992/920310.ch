Glad I could help!

Msg 45533 is 04 line(s) on 03/07/92 from JOSEPH SKOM
to ALL re: OPTICAL DRIVE

I am considering purchasing the optical drive for my PS/2 Model 50.  I
was wondering if anyone has used this product (it uses disks that look
like CDs and have 128 megabyte capacity).  If so, what is your opinion
of the reliability of this drive?

Msg 45534 is 04 line(s) on 03/08/92 from MICHAEL SHARTIAG
to ALL re: MICHELANGELO ATTACK

A friend of mine got hit by the virus.  I am going to attempt to recover
the files, but it would help if I knew exactly what areas of the disk
it attacked.  Does anyone have any info on this?  Will this be an i
impossibility ???

to WARD re: CGA (?) MONITOR FOR SALE

Here's part of a message I saw on the Lively Arts BBS tonight.  Maybe
this is something your friend can use.
.
Subject: Make me an offer or trade
MONITOR AOC MONICHROME 9pin Amber Like new (4) $49.00 + shipping

Msg 45537 is 03 line(s) on 03/10/92 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to WARD re: CGA

Few people carry CGA, with the glaring (pun intended) exception of
Radio Shock.  They even have the temerity to tout their 'high
resolution' cga monitors...
No dup. chars.
