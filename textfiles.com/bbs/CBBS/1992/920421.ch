 Heh heh, this software hasn't been changed in about 10 years. Thanks
for the implicit compliment - but it is more ancient history than usable
code. Matter of fact, it is about 20,000 lines of assembler - 8080
assembler.

Msg 45602 is 30 line(s) on 04/17/92 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to RICHARD HINTON re: R/OS2 2.0?

 I don't particularly like Windows, but I like the features provided by
PageMaker and Corel Draw. I found things like Dos under Windows, weren't
what I wanted - It didn't allow that much memory, no memory protection,
etc. Then again, I didn't like OS/2, either. I generally think GUI's are
a waste of time - I'd much rather run TreeView (file "shell") and have nice
little shortcuts like ^E bringing up my favorite editor, Alt-T bringing up
Treeview, etc. (I do this via Ansi.sys keyboard redefinitions).
 When IBM started hyping OS/2 2.0 as a "better DOS than DOS", I sort of
perked my ears, but still basically kept my pessimistic attitude. When
people said I should try it, I would come up with reasons not to. BUT
they soon were answering all my why-nots with but-it-can's. For example,
I INSIST on swapping control and caps keys, because many of my favorite
DOS utilities are control-key oriented - makes 'em VERY fast and productive
because I don't have to pick up from the home row to the cursor pad and back.
They answered "OK, it can do it". Sure enough I've now installed OS/2 2.0
and it DOES allow me to run my control-caps swapper.
 "I want ansi.sys keyboard definitions". No problem, they were there.
(Actually, the RELEASE version seems to have problems - I'm investigating).
 "I want Adobe type manager in my Windows applications". Fine! I've
got it.
 In general, most of my questions have been answered. Colors are
sufficiently customizable to allow me a basically black screen for most
system functions. True multi-tasking between DOS - multiple DOSs if I
want 'em - Windows, and OS/2 applications, with rather complete protection,
is really delivered.
 If you have Windows, you can upgrade for $49 for a limited time. I
think the # is 1-800-3IBMOS2, but not sure (at least, a wrong 800 # isn't
likely to get someone out of the shower ;-). If you have a 386, 40M of
disk free, and 8M of memory, I'd give it a try. Coexists nicely with DOS -
as a dual boot environment (boot /dos or boot /os2 commands). More Q's? Ask!

 Another thing you might try is a local dealer. I've liked dealing
with CompuElectronics, right across the street from ElekTek on North
Lincoln avenue. I got a 386/SX-25 from him, mini tower, etc. It was
some time ago, and prices change, but you might give him a try.
 Interestingly, the guy I deal with is called "Ram", but it is an
Indian name, pronounced "rahm" which is how you pronounce "ROM". SO,
a guy named Ram, pronounced ROM - how can you go wrong? (grin)

Msg 45604 is 07 line(s) on 04/18/92 from AL HIGGINS
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/OS2 2.0?

I just received by upgrade notice ffrom IBM today. Will send it next
week and wait for release 2.0 to show up on the front porch. Soon I hope.
As for OS2 I plan on keeping my system dual boot for a while. Once I get
comfprtable with OS2 I'll move the other function over to my other
machine.
If you run into anything unusual with rlease 2.0 let the rest of us know!
Thanks.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/COMPUADD EXPRESS

Alas, Ward, I haven't lived in Chicago in three years! I'm in
Schenectady, near Albany, NY. I've tried the locals, but I've seen
enough of their machines (the college I work at buys lots) to be
very skeptical. Lots of problems, lots of things that seem to be
'made to fit.' The CompuAdd machines seem nicely built and
integrated (not to mention small!), and one of the nicest features is
the keyboard, which has a good tactile feel (slight break) but which is
silent! I guess that if I lived in Chicago still, I'd llikely
roll my own.
 I do like the idea of a mini-tower, but I don't think I need one. This
critter should be about 4" high and just about as wide as the 14" monitor
that sits on top. One of the ways they save space is by
using a Cannon drive that combines 3.5" and 5.25" drives in a single unit.
Also, much of the stuff that I need (HRVGA controller, 2S 1P ports, IDE
controller, ETC, is on the mamaboard, which means that the slots that
ARE available can be used for things like modems and scanners. Kind of
cool - the cards fit into a vertical board and mount sideways, so
they are parallel to the MB. Anyway, I've ordered one. I'll let you
know what it's like once it arrives. Sure to be a change from my
trusty Kaypro 2'84 and (more recently) Zenith 151 :-)!
 Rahm/RAM/ROM - sounds like TRON!

Well I also sent in for the 2.0 upgrade and will see how it works.
Does anyone know if I can get 4 meg by 1 DRAMS? I have an older
mother board that takes only DRAMS, and I have 1 meggers in there now
Thanks,

Did you know that OS2 needs 4-8 meg of RAM to run?
Did you know it needs 20-40 meg of storage to run OS2?
Did you know I'll get OS2 when RAM chips grows on trees?

have another os2 question for you or bill matsen.
we have an application that is written for os2 utilizing the fat format.
we need to be able to optomize the hard disk, but have not been able to
find a utility that will support this task within os2.
as the application is rather disk intensive, it doesn't take long to
trash the hard disk. any easssssy suggestions. any help would be
appreciated. thanks!
