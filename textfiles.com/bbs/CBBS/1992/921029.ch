to ALL re: INTERNET VIA PUBNET?

Does Chicago have any "Pubnets" for accessing the Internet?
 An article in ONLINE ACCESS, in the Fall 1992 issue, gives three access
routes to Internet: Local universities, commericial BBS's, and Pubnets:
 "The third, and often the cheapest route, is through public access
networks, often referred to as Pubnets. There are hundreds of Pubnets
spread throughout the world. A Pubnet can best be described as a
noncomercial BBS specializing in providing Internet access. Charges are
nominal; in fact, in many cases, access is free. Pubnets grew out of
the ideal that internet access should be available to all."
 "To find out more about Pubnets, and to find your nearest site,
subscribe to the Pubnet mailing list by sending an e-mail message to:
 pubnet-request@chinacat.unicom.com
