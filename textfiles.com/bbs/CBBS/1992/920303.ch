For others who may be interested, I placed a version of the Central
Point AntiVirus software on my BBS for my clients to download. This
version checks ONLY for the Michelangelo virus and the Friday the
(March) 13th virus. CP has authorized distribution of this limited
version without charge. It contains complete instructions through a
READ.ME file. Call The Advocate, 312.939.3300, 300--2400 bps, 8/n/1
(Loop area) and read the download instructions in a log-on Bulletin.

It has been a LONG day....The phone number in the previous message is
wrong (my voice number <G>). The correct number is 312.939.4411.

(I would appreciate it if one of the system operators would be kind
enough to edit the preceding message, then K this one. I don't relish
voice, fax AND modem calls coming in on my main line <G>. Thanks.
