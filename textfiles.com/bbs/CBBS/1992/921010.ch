]re Boardwatch: Just a wry sort of half a joke. In the B'watch
contest I had voted for the 1st bulletin board, Ward's & Randy's CBBS,
which Randy engineered and for which Ward wrote 20,000 lines of code.

Msg 45786 is 25 line(s) on 10/09/92 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: LAP/PALM SHOW

 Spent most of two days at the Lap/Palm show in Chicago - Thurs & Fri.
The most interesting box I saw was from Gateway - a 2.75# sub-notebook,
with 400-line (double-scan CGA), 40M hard disk, (an ultra-thin 2.5"er)
etc. $1295 direct. I've got details if you're interested.
 IBM showed off its new line of machines: all are called "Thinkpad", which
is dumb, because that makes you think of the "pad" - i.e. pen based one.
 The 300 is a 5.9# monochrome machine, with 80 ($1375) or 120 ($1575)
hard disk, 4M ram, ethernet ($125 (ea.) adapter cable for 10baseT or
thinnet), and a REALLY NEAT "port replicator" which allows you to hang
your cables off of the back of this 1.5" thick thingie - serial, parallel,
power, VGA, mouse, keyboard - and quickly connect or disconnect all, with
a simple motion.
 The 300 is a 386SL at 25mhz with 64K cache.
 The 700 line is the IBM 486SLC (a 16-bit I/O (bad) 16K cache (Good!)
chip made by IBM based upon Intel licensing) running at 25MHz, with an
upgrade available to the 25/50 chip. An 80M machine goes for $2700, and
120M for $2950 (if I'm recalling right).
 The 700C is a Beeeautiful 10.4 (largest in the industry, I think!) color
active matrix 486SLC - goes for 4300 or so - anticipated street of $4k.
The 700C was so agressively priced (this is with 3-year on-site warranty!)
that other machines like the 300C just "fell out of the line".
 -
 Other interesting things - there are now several vendors of GPS hardware
and software so if for example you're into sailing, you can tell exactly
where you are at any time. Pretty slick. (Didn't get prices).

Msg 45787 is 10 line(s) on 10/10/92 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to ALL re: ALL COMMAND.COM'S IDENTICAL?

Is there only one identical edition of COMMAND.COM found in MS-DOS 5.0
(and PC-DOS 5.0), no matter which OEM distributes that DOS? Is the same
true for DOS 3.1? 3.2? 3.3? 4.0?
 The reason I ask is that I've developed a utility that locates the
errorlevel storage area in COMMAND.COM, retrieves that errorlevel, and
then displays it. I've done this for my copies of COMMAND.COM for the
above versions (except 4.0). Before releasing this utility, I'd like
to be sure that it's universally usable.
 If anyone is interested in having this utility work for DOS 4.0 also,
or for DR DOS, let me know.
