]I'm a sysop of a board here in Toronto, called the "Programmer's
Paradise.".  (416) 482-1470.  I noticed that you were a major historical
system here, and I wanted to see if you had any peices of source code
that you might be willing to contribute to our BBS...  We support all
languages, all computers.  (Multis linguis, multis platforms.. :-))

Anyways, Hello!  I'd LOVE to go to your 14th anniversary party on the
15th, but I'm afraid that I will be 3000 or some odd miles away...
But I *will* post an announcement to commemorate the 14th anniversary
of the first BBS.

Ben -- greetings!  I've just about decided it's hardware, since
I can't make my home machine (an ancient Zenith 151) do the
same thing.  Ah well.  Are you stiill using CP/M
at all, by the way?  I've written a 22DISK definition to deal with
the Advent DSDD (Kaypro+TurboROM) format.  If you need it, it's
yours.  Also, glad to see you playing with 4DOS.  I guess that it's
the MS-DOS equivalent of ZCPRR!

My 500C should be here in 2 days (I hope!), I was out purching
supplies and was shocked at what they wanted for a box of
overhead sheets for the 500C. $51 at E.T. I passed on them for a while.
I have a bunch of the transparty sheets from the HP plotter, do you
have any idea if those will work?????
No dup. chars.
