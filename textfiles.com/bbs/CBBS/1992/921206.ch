 Give us a clue - what kind of "clues" are you looking for? Actually,
I don't think I've ever seen an AS/400 question here.
 I'm trying to remember - hmmm - I vaguely recall a "midrange" BBS
somewhere that I think catered to AS/400 folks. But I don't have a shot
at remembering it. Perhaps someone else will.
 Where 'ya going to school? What is the name/content of the course?
(if you feel like being "chatty").

to ALL re: PENTIUM: 64 BIT?

 Is the 586 64 bits externally? I recall IBM saying the model 90 and 95
were the most "likely" to be able to handle a Pentium, since it used a
dual-path to memory - BUT - I think that was for "memory interleave", and
that is a performance thing. If the 586 would use BOTH paths, the memory
would be slower, I think!

 Randy got the modem "zapped" to support MNP - I got "CONNECT 2400/ARQ"
tonight, so it seems to work fine. Should help the folks getting some
line noise, such as you, Michael.
 Let me know how it works.

to STEVE AIDIKONIS re: R/TELCO QUESTION

yes they can. It's one of thoese thecnological advances years ago,
the equipment to support TT was cheaper than rotary, also there was
so many rotary phones out there it wasn't worth their while to try
and charge people for TT service. The local operating telephone
company normally catches people when they move, they ask you if the
phoenes your taking with you are TT. For those of us who haven't
moved for a while. they don't know. IL Bell started a campain
s ago to boos ago to boost their profit my asking their entire customer
base if they using TT or rotary phones. They call up our house and
asked my kids when they answered the phone, and guess what, next
month was a charge for TT service. If you tell then you don't use TT
service they "may" just turn the your service down to accept rotary only.
After I complained about the charge, they dropped the charge, AND REVERTED
my service to rotary. Doesn't make any difference to me as that line is
used for incoming only!
So be prepaired.

to ALL re: HP DJ500C CARTRIDGES

Over the past year I have collected a number of printer cartridges. I've
refilled them with other colors other than black and thats worked fine.
The problem I'm having is keeping the ink jet end from drying up
between uses. There was a nice little container for storing the cartridges
that came with the machine. Has anyone seen an after market device that
will hold 3-5 cartridges??????
Also, has anyone seen kits for filling the tri-colored cartridge? Has
anyone been successful in filling one of those cartridges??

to WARD/ALL re: PHONE NOISE

Ward,
 I had that connect 1200 happen also. If the burst of noise comes while
the modem is cheking the 2400 speed they miss 'handshaking' and it
skips down ( it seems that what happened) I'll try complaining about a
multiplexer to Ma Bell. I have called repair 4 times now and they keep
saying there is no problem, yet I continue to get noise calling here and
one other location in the same switch. I also had a client with the same
problem in Buffalo Grove to libertyville call, and again Bell said no
problem was found, but the problem also went away after they tested it.
I don't think MNP will help this severe of a noise problem, there are
actual clicks and pops in the line.
