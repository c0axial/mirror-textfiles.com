 The more usual way would be to check out FDISK first - that way you
know if the drive is DOS compatible. You could remove the partition,
add it back, format it /S and go.
 P.S. you said "format & sys", I presume you know that format /s does
that. What I'm not clear on is under what condx COMMAND.COM gets copied
over. One does, one doesn't - i.e. like sys c: doesn't, but format c: /s
does.

Hmm. I didn't think of FDISK. Thanks!

to DENNIS STAHL re: R/CARDINAL CLONE - DRDOS VS. D

Why do you want to get rid of DRDOS? It'll run everything you can
run under MS-DOS, and has a number of benefits. As far as I can
tell, you'd only be LOSING functionality by going to MSDOS 3.xx.
Of course, I'm assuming that you're talking DRDOS 6.0, which has
all that MS-DOS 5.0 has and then some. DRDOS 5.0 was supposedly
the motivating force behind MSDOS 5;

But if you DO want to replace it, I'm pretty certain that you can
boot up from an MS-DOS (3.31+) floppy and just FORMAT C:/S to
start things anew.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: FAX

There is no simple editor shipped with Faxability. But since its a windows
app. You could use just about any windows editor. Such as notepad for text
and paint (Windows Paint) for graphics. I personally use Word for Windows
and Micrografx Draw or Paint for images.
Now having a fax board for a few months I find its best use is to fax a
quick note to a client or associate to AVOID a phone call! Seems that
every phone call turns into 10-15 minutes.a fax only takes 2-3 minutes!

to ALL re: FOR SALE

I have a couple of laptops for sale. Both are Zeniths. One is a 10Mhz
286 with 40 Meg (80 w/Stacker) hard disk, and a 2400 baud internal modem
The other is a 12Mhz TurboSport 386 with a 104 Meg hard disk and a
power saving internal 2400 baud modem. Yes, I want to save up and
get one of those nifty new color notebooks.but need to sell off these.
I also have a Xircom "pocket" ethernet adapter I could bundle in with
either one if your interested. But are in perfect working order.
