to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/COLORADO TAPE DRIVES

 A good idea, but this guy is paranoid about his 100% UL-approved,
surge-protected, superdeluxe Epson catching fire overnight and won't
hear of having the computer on after hours. There are a LOT of things
that this inconveniences, especially the installation of a new revision
of his sales tracking software that will take over ten hours to install,
meaning that I'm going to have to get up at 5:00 one morning (yuck) to
be there before 7 AM to begin the install.
 He's usually an intelligent guy, but he has his quirks. I've got to
find a way to make that one a costly quirk, since this install could be
started at 3 PM and left to finish itself overnight, too.
 Oh, well, at least his secretary has learned to format tapes so I
don't have to make a special trip to do it for them. <sigh>
dup. chars.
