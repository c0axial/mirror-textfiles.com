  There's nothing official, but I found something from one person
via our internal BBS - he sent me the files...  I keep thinking I could
just drop 'em off, but I've been getting to work early and leaving late,
I should have just gotten your mailing addr.
  Call me at work and drop off a mailing addr, or leave it here as a
command when you do the (G)ood-bye command.
  Sorry I didn't get it to you sooner!

  I think low-density is OK, but the BIOS didn't support 1.44 - internally
in IBM I checked - everyone was using some special program someone internally
wrote.

  Will this be a full windows application?  If so, you need to get the
toolkit, or work in a language that has it built-in, such as Visual Basic,
or Borland ... I forget which one.... (even the sample program blows up ;-)

to BOB SULLIVAN re: R/C QUESTION

   "Vectoring"?  You mean, a line from (1,1) to (5,5), and having it
show up?  NO!  This is a VERY complex issue.  For one thing, there would
have to be a printer driver for every different printer; then there's
the issue of how much memory you want to devote, etc.
  The typical way that a package dumps to a printer in graphics mode,
is this:
  1. create a buffer in memory as large as possible.  It represents a
"Band" of the printer - for example at 200 DPI, 8" wide, B/W only, you
have 200 bytes per horizontal dot line - lets say you could afford 20K,
this would be 100 vertical dot lines - a half inch (only!).
  2. Run your graphics generation program, a vector at a time, to the
output driver - which then uses well-documented "clipping" techniques to
determine if that particular line is "in" the "band" currently in memory,
and if so, it "plots" that line into the "band".
  3. When all of the graphics have been processed, "dump" that band to
the printer - it will thus print 1/2" vertically by 8" wide.
  4. Clear the buffer, logically move it down (to the next 1/2").
  5. loop back to step 2 - yes, generate the WHOLE thing again, this time
capturing just the parts that are in the 2nd 1/2" of vertical space.
 ----
  Needless to say, this is a VERY non-trivial thing to do!  It is MUCH
easier with a Laser with a full-page of memory, since you can plot the
vectors directly out to the printer memory then just issue the print page
when you're done.

to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/POSTSCRIPT VS PCL

  It would be printer dependent.  For example, (a pretty BAD example)
the postscript printer I use at work requires me to set up a file
"standard_output = ascii", and then run a "PagePrinter Config" pointing
to the file - after that I can just treat the printer as a ProPrinter,
even including graphics.  When I need Postscript again, I have to run
the config program pointing to a file containing the one line
"standare_output = PostScript".  I'm not saying yours is ANYTHING LIKE THIS
but that that's how one mfgr did it.  I believe the newer version of the
driver for that printer uses multiple simulated ports - i.e. LPT2: is
postscript, LPT1: is ascii, etc.

to AL HIGGINS re: R/HP DESKJET 500 INKJET PRINTE

  Are you aware that paper has "sides"?  What may seem to bleed a
little may be the wrong side.  I bought some very GOOD paper, and it
was about the worst I'd tried - six months later I thought about the
"side" issue - sure enough - the other side was great!
  I use Hammermill paper 10300-2, under $4/ream.  For something a bit
better, there are various Laser related papers.
  P.S. sorry, but I'm a nut on spelling:
  its hear -> it's here.
  seams -> seems
  reguards -> regards
  aprox -> approx
  heh heh you might consider one of the spelling checkers.. (though it
won't catch things like "there $23.99" which took me a while to figure out
meant "They are $23.99" -> "They're $23.99".

to ALL re: WHAT TO DO WITH AN IBM 8512?

I have an IBM 8512 (their el cheapo lo-res one) that just died on me.
There's something wrong with the vertical sync; the characters just
flip from the bottom of the screen to the top.

How much would it cost to get this sucker fixed anyway?  In the meantime,
I'm using a Panasonic C1381i; it's much nicer than the 8512, too (not
to mention less expensive).
