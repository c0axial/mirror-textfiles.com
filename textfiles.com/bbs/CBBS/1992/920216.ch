05 ?used it to modulate a small 500V power supply, so the headband blinked

07 ?  Mike Warot brought a big copper bus bar, to show the effect of eddy
08 ?currents caused by very very strong rare earth magnets - it was amazing,
09 ?the 'drag' of just moving a magnet across a non-magnetic surface.  Even
10 ?"dropping" the magnet onto the bus bar - it wouldn't hit hard- the eddy
11 ?currents repelled the magnet and let it down gently!
12 ?  About 25 folks showed up this year - half of last year, not sure why.
13 ?  It was at Barnaby's Pizza, Touhy & California.
