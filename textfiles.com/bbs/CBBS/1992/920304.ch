to ALL re: BUY CGA MONITOR?

 A friend has a laptop. It has a 9-pin CGA adapter on the back. He'd
like to run off of a tube rather than the built-in monitor when he's
at home.
 Anyone got a used CGA monitor for sale? - or do you know where one
can be bought? Seems the local stores don't handle 'em any more!

Msg 45530 is 04 line(s) on 03/04/92 from MICHAEL SHARTIAG
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/BUY CGA MONITOR?

Ward,
 An EGA monitor will work also, but they are becoming hard to find.
DAMARK or one of the other closeout people had a CGA monitor for $129 I
believe.
