 Thanks! I tried the Northgate back when I first bought my AST premium
in '87, but they had the enlarged enter key and "lost" \ key.
 I must presume they have changed a lot since then! Do you know if any
have the ctrl-caps switch on TOP so a machine with multiple users can
have each switch it to their preference?
 Thanks.

I just got a new Northgate 102, and the dip switches are all in a little
opening that's on top of the keyboard. There's also a little orange
key that lets you make some changes on the fly. I'm not sure whether
it lets you change CTRL-CAPs Lock on the fly without looking atthe
manual. (Sorry, but I like the large Enter key - I use SmartKey to
move /\ to locations that I want (in place of '", but then I use
Dvorak layout, which changes lots of things!)

Msg 45873 is 13 line(s) on 11/08/92 from TONY ANTONUCCI
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: FAX

Just got Faxability With OCR. Send/Recv'd a few FAXes with a friend of mine
today to test the OCR. We tried pages with several different fonts and size
sizes. It did pretty well, much better than I thought it would. With a
fixed pitch font (about 12pt) it only had 2 or 3 errors on the page.
The software can put a "~" char before every char it is not sure of. And
it did put a "~" before every char it got "wrong", but also a few that
were correct.
The software can save the OCR output into about 30-40 different formats
which is nice. I saved it into Word for Windows format, doctored it up,
and retransmitted it all in under 5 minutes. The OCR is pretty slow, with
it taking 45-90 seconds per page (lots faster then I can re-type! ); )
It works with many different FAX boards, not just Intel's (but I do have
the Intel).

Msg 45874 is 11 line(s) on 11/08/92 from BOB SULLIVAN
to ALL re: MODEM PROBLEM

Has anyone heard of the following problem? I have a PRACTICAL
PERIPHERALS modem that is 5+ years old and used about once or twice per
week for about 30 min. I have recently moved my computer station to a
previous location that worked well last time. This includes the change
in phone jacks.
 Here is the problem. After my first dial out, when I try to dial via the
modem it starts ringing instead of dialing along with some other noises.
I get around this by adding extra nulls or spaces between the "AT DT"and
the actual number. About 30 spaces works well.
 Any ideas of what the cause is? Ever heard of a similar problem?
Thanks for any help.

Msg 45876 is 11 line(s) on 11/09/92 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to ALL re: WHAT COULD CAUSE THIS

A client of mine has a Micropolis 1664 330MB ESDI drive with an Ultrastor
controller card (the one with the small cache), and a Colorado 250 tape
drive with controller (i.e. not using the floppy controller). These were
originally installed in a 386DX-16 system and were moved to a DX-40 some
months ago. Since the transplant, the client noticed that tape backups
were taking significantly longer. While looking into some other things,
I ran Norton SI and got a disk performance index of only 2.9 (the reported
seek time was about right for the drive, but the data transfer rate was
reported as zero) and the test took quite some time to run (no caching
software was installed at the time).
Has anyone run into something like this before?

Msg 45878 is 07 line(s) on 11/09/92 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to WARD & BILL & TONY re: COMMAND.COM

The variations of COMMAND.COM have forced me to give up on trying to find
the errorlevel byte in each. What I've done instead is create a TSR that
will intercept all program terminations, and save a copy of the result
code. A non-TSR copy of the same utility can then retrieve the latest result
code on demand and then display it. (Useful for debugging and development
of both programs and *.BAT files.)
Thanks for all your responses.

Msg 45879 is 15 line(s) on 11/09/92 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to WARD & ALL re: WIERD PROBLEM SOLVED.

I recently installed DOS 5.0 on my original IBM AT (1984 BIOS). It
worked fine except for one peculiar problem: It wouldn't boot from
a 3.5" drive, even though I transferred the system to the diskette
as specified in the DOS manual. "Big deal," you say; "the BIOS is
too old." That's what a techie at the store where I bought DOS 5.0
said. The only thing is, DOS 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 would all boot from
a 3.5" diskette under the same hardware configuration! Even tech
support at Microsoft was baffled.
 Turns out the problem was the boot sector on the diskette. For
some reason, the disk parameter block (which describes the diskette
format to the ROM-BIOS during a boot and also at other times) had
one bad parameter: The hidden sectors value. Instead of the 0000
which is normal for diskettes, it had a value of 8000! Don't know
how that value got there; but changing it solved the boot problem-
and hasn't caused any other problems yet (knock wood).

 HI, sorry I am seeing your questions for the first time - I just got back
from an out-of-town trip to the "Hacker's Convention" that is an invitation-
only conference among industry pioneers, etc. I was really humbled by the
list of folks there.
 You are asking when a good time to ask a few questions would be. Well,
it would have been days ago when your first called! A BBS is a way for
people to be in contact without having to be on the phone. SO, please ASK
your questions at YOUR convenience, and I'll answer them at MY convenience.
YOU don't even have to take notes then - you'll have verbatim quotes. So
when would be a good time to talk? Right now for the time being there
wouldn't be a good time. .by VOICE. but ANY time is FINE by modem
to CBBS.
 Also though I don't plan to call, I wouldn't even if I wanted to - you
didn't leave an area code and I'm not about to "try" to see where you might
live! Owell, gotta run.

to TONY ANTONUCCI re: R/FAX

 Hey, that Faxability sounds cool - especially the OCR.
 Tell me, is there a simple editor shipped with it? One problem I saw
was if you faxed something into your system, in order to fax it out (i.e.
you wanted a graphic image but didn't have a scanner) then you were sending
out a fax with YOUR INCOMING header on it. A simple editor to chop that
off would be useful.
 I realize that since you said it could be saved in a bunch of formats,
you could drop it into, say, PC Paintxxx but that would be an extra step,
and come to think of it, an 8.5" wide 200-dpi image by 11" long (or
longer) would be quite LARGE and ungainley to "quickly edit".

Msg 45883 is 02 line(s) on 11/09/92 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to BOB SULLIVAN re: R/MODEM PROBLEM

 How about slowing down the speed at which you send the ATDT - i.e.
send it at about 10 char/sec? I can do that in my current COMM program.

 That (8000 as the # if reserved sectors or whatever it was) IS
very strange! I should shoot you a copy of my DISKPARM program that
quickly dumps the disk parm block off of any floppy or hard disk:
DiskParm 9/10/88 by Ward Christensen
 Defaults to A: drive, or specify a drive: DiskParm c:
00 02 01 01 00 02 E0 00 40 0B F0 09 00 12 00 02 00 00 00
~~~~~ ~~ ~~~~~ ~~ ~~~~~ ~~~~~ ~~ ~~~~~ ~~~~~ ~~~~~ ~~~~~
 512 bytes per sector
 1 sectors per cluster
 1 reserved sector
 2 copies of fat
 224 root entries
 2880 sectors per disk
 F0 media descriptor
 9 sectors per fat
 18 sectors per track
 2 heads
 0 hidden sectors
 Actually if there were an 8000 in hidden sectors or reserved sectors,
I don't know if it would say "32768" or not! But the HEX part would have
shown you it anyway (I wrote it sort of as a tutorial, i.e. so you could
see the hex corresponding to the appropriate decimal values).

to ALL re: INTERNET ACCESS

 Direct accesss to the Internet is available to members of the various
university communities, and is not generally available to "outsiders."
The University of Chicago was rather generous about it for a long time,
but recently closed access to all but a few outsiders. Even alumnii
were not spared.
 Chinet, which sits on the same desk as this CBBS, offers indirect
access in the form of news and email. (News is now received via
satellite.)
 Direct access to Internet is available through other non-commercial
as well as commercial providers. Unfortunately for Chicago residents,
the nearest non-commercial providers I know of are Merit/MichNet and
CICNet, both of Ann Arbor, Mich and Netillinois and CICNet, both in
Urbana.
 I believe the least costly commercial provider with access via a
phone number in downtown Chicago is Holonet, 46 Shattuck Sq., Berkeley,CAl.

to WARD/ALL re: DESKJET EXPERIENCES

OK, I'm about to buy a printer - my 8 year old Oki'92 is at death's
door. The DeskJet 500 looks good to me, and I kno Ward is a fan,\
SO: What should I know about before plunking $400 or so for it? I've
heard that the beasty can be refilled with a syringe and fountain-pen
ink, too - is this true?
