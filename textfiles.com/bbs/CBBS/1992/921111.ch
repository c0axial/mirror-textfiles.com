 I have a . uh . HAD . a Watson. One day I decided that it was
dumb to have a computer on, hard drive spinning, etc, just as a phone
answering machine - no matter how fancy!
 It was NICE, had nice features, etc, could schedule calls, handle
multiple incoming, etc. But I just decided I didn't like the "idea".
 What's your application!

 Nope. CBBS was never for file transfer. On a single-line system, it
ties things up too much, so when Randy & I invented the BBS, it didn't do
file transfers, even though I'd invented what became XMODEM about 6
months before. Sorry.

My wife has started a small business, and produceses several different
products. We've tryed an answering machine and that doesn't work. People
that are calling for product A dont want to listen to a short script for
product B or C. Likewise, people who are calling for everyday business
related activities DO NOT Want to listen to the advertising.
Based upon that, I thought the easiest way to sole the problem would
be to use a interactive voice card. I have the sapre PC so I can use
it for voice messaging and faxing and unload my other machine of those tasks
And last bt not least, the PC add in cards are economical as compared to
the commercial units range from aprox. $5,000 to $50,000.

By the way, do you still have the voice card or did you sell it?
If you did sell it, is there anyone in Chicago that sells this type
of product? The MFG refered me to Comp USA, they don't know what I'm
talking about nor does Tiger Software. Guess I'll have to make some more
phone calls! Thanks.

Well, how much would you want? I'm serious, a money IS a consideration,
and I trust you took good are of the critter. Remember that one of us
would have to pay shipping to upstate NY. If you'd really be willing
to sell the printer, call me at (518) 382-1880, evenings, until 11:00
Eastern time. Thanks!
