to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/DJ500 PROBLEM (!)

 Well, I expect you are looking for an answer from me (grin) but I must
admit, your "Since problems with the DJ are so rare." comment applies
to me - I've not run into such a thing. Is the printer and computer
plugged into the same outlet? (better "relative" grounding that way -
to coin a term). Voodoo. Seems appropriate.
 Gee, I really don't know what to do to help.other than suggesting
trying another cable.

to STEVE AIDIKONIS re: R/TELCO QUESTION

 Yep, the telco sure can take away your ability to use touch tone.
 What happened, was that in the early days of touch tone, the switching
equipment wasn't very sophisticated, so they just slapped touch-tone
receivers on EVERY line. NOW, your switching office proably has put in
newer highly-computerized switches, and it can do things like individually
reject touch tones - probably a bit in memory somewhere. You'll have to
start paying.
 Gee, it just dawned on me - CBBS's line probably shouldn't be having
touch-tone on it! It annoys me to have to pay $13/month for an "incoming"
line! (Talking CBBS/The Ward Board - I dunno about CBBS/Chicago).

I have a test coming up next Thursday on working on the AS/400. Sure could
use some help. Will check back 12/06 for clues! -Angela
