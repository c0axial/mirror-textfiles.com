  Hey, it is that time again!  Chinet and CBBS' 14th anniversary
pizza bash at Barnabys, Touhy @ California Sat 2:00 PM, Feb 15th.
  Take the Edens North of the city to Touhy, go East to California,
Barnabys is on the N. side of the street - 2832 W. Touhy I think.

to WARD re: CBBS XIV

Congratulations!  I think that I first encountered CBBS in
1984, using borrowed software and modem.  That was back in
the days when men were real men, women were real women, and
BYTE wasn't for people who wore suits all the time.  Of course,
CBBS was already well-on by then <GRIN>!  Having finally gotten
altogether out of CP/M (do you know people will still pay $50
for a Kaypro??), I now eagerly look forward to each login so
that I can get a sense of what got me into this perverse stuff
in the first place...HAPPY ANNIVERSARY and many more to come!

You should be able to get the Laserwriter to work on a PC. I've never
tried it, but several software packages that I;ve come accross, appear
to support it (I think Windows 3.0 is one of them!)

This is all theory, though.....
