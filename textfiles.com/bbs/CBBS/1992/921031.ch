to ALL re: INTERNET VIA PUBNET?

Does Chicago have any "Pubnets" for accessing the Internet?
 An article in ONLINE ACCESS, in the Fall 1992 issue, gives three access
routes to Internet: Local universities, commericial BBS's, and Pubnets:
 "The third, and often the cheapest route, is through public access
networks, often referred to as Pubnets. There are hundreds of Pubnets
spread throughout the world. A Pubnet can best be described as a
noncomercial BBS specializing in providing Internet access. Charges are
nominal; in fact, in many cases, access is free. Pubnets grew out of
the ideal that internet access should be available to all."
 "To find out more about Pubnets, and to find your nearest site,
subscribe to the Pubnet mailing list by sending an e-mail message to:
 pubnet-request@chinacat.unicom.com

Ted Moran called CBBS but goofed and left a comment instead of a msg,
so I'll leave the msg for him. Please "E"nter a msg right to Ted if
you have an answer:

]This is way cool board. I am looking for a Mac program or method to
read those damned PKZIP files on other boards. Can anyone help?? I
need to be able read text files and/or download them, but almost everything
these days is all zipped up, and my mac does not seem able to handle
them. Help, please!

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/ZIP FILES ON MAC?

I asked a Mac guru at work and he said there is a commercial program
called Stuff It Deluxe that is available. He also said that there were
a number of shareware programs one of which is called DEZIP.
