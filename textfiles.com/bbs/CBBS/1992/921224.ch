]__I guess when you don't call in for 2 months, you should EXPECT
to have to catch up over 100 messages! (I can recall, back in
the mid-80's when, if you'd not called for 60 days, you'd be
trying to catch up about 1,200 or so...)

 > What if you had two programs with the same name?
 I don't get it. How could I? I moved ALL my executable utilties
down to a \sys\bin\unused, then move 'em back as I need 'em.
 matter of fact I wrote a little "I.bat" that looks first for a .COM,
then a .EXE, then a .BAT, and if finding one, moves it back from
.unused to \sys\bin.
 You say your solution is to use 4DOS's description function -
my problem isn't that I don't know what they are - it is that it
would be a big process to sort thru 300 executable programs trying to
decide which you really use. With my trick, if you try to use it,
you have to "bring it back" from the .\unused directory.
 Actually, I have MEGABYTES to clean up on another system - but
it is not a matter of not knowing what it is, it is a matter of
trying to decide what to keep. I have a large neough hard disk that
I've become a pack rat - I have Turbo C, 1.0, 20, Turbo C+, Borland
C+, etc. Actually, the only one I use it Turbo C 2.0, so I'm
wondering if I should just "Blow the others away". But then again
might be nice to keep 'em around in case I "grow" into C+.
