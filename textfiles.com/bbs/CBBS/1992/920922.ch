Geez, I thought an era had passed...
I used to check into CBBS regularly bunches of years ago...
when I tried dialing in a while back and got nothing, I was sad...
I'm not familiar witinet... I know what it is, that's about all...
glad to see the old board breathing.
I expect to be around to see what's happening, maybe even contribute
once or twice.
Take care!

I've heard only good things about it, but it's priced with modems that
have fax capability. If you are interested in fax, there are plenty of
modems that have v.32bis PLUS fax and are similarly priced.
