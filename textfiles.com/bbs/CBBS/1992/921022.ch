Do you have any info as to when the 4079 color printer will be
available or any paper info on same?

Like most things, you must match what you purchase with your intended uses.
But for starters, you should look for three things: access speed; whether
the MS CD-ROM Extensions file Ward mentioned in fact is supplied; and
whether the interface is supplied in the base price.
 A few of the VERY lowest-end products file to provide the .EXE
file. Many charge extra (as much as $100) for the interface). Access
speed is a more complex subject and directly relates to your current and
future plans. If you simply want to read files from the drive, anything
around 340ms access time is fine. But for technical reasons, if you plan
to do such things as use reference-book CDs which demand random access of
index files, you may want something much faster.
 With careful shopping, the lower end of decent products can now be
had in the U.S. for under $350; higher-end products double or triple that.
 The shortest answer for users who don't need a lot of searching
capability (or who are willing to wait for the delays) is simply to look
for a product with the MPC (Multimedia PC Council) compliance logo.
 BTW, the cheapest of the CDs with solid specs has been the Sony
CDU-535. After eval-ing various alternatives for an article, that's the one
I personally settled on.which is about the best endorsement I probably
can make. <G>
 FWIW, if you want a detailed expansion of the above plus a survey
of a couple of dozen shareware CD disks, one version of my article will
appear in Shareware Magazine, whose Nov/Dec issue should show up at news
outlets and computer stores any day now.
 Good luck.

My Sci America arrived on the day that I posted the message. It is the
Nov 92 issue with a picture of an ant holding a micro-gear. The article
title is "Software 'glitches' that endanger public safety."
I have come to the tentative conclusion that even software needs the
wisdom gained from actual experience.

to ALL re: 386DX "FEATURE"?

Here's an interesting quote from DATAMATION, September 15, 1992, p. 19:
 "One problem already turned up in the early prerelease beta version
of NT: incompatibility with early 'b1' runs of Intel's 386DX
microprocessor, hundreds of thousands of which have shipped.in
mid- and high-end machines."
 The "incompatibility" evidentally was some function that differed
from that on later versions of that chip. Anyone know what it was?
Anyone know of other functional differences (in 386/486 chips)
that affect execution of 8086 machine code?

Thanks, that was the info I needed.

It so happens that I just read that Gateway 2000 is offering Sony CD ROMs
for $225. You and Ward helped me to decide to go that route. Thanks for the
help.
