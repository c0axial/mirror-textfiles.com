to WARD re: DESKJET

Well, I went and bought one, so. It's a nice critter. It's hard to
believe that, running on 20 watts, this thing can rival the ouput of
a LaserJet that takes the juice of an air conditioner!

Also - have you noticed? - it prints graphics a LOT faste than the
LJ. At least with PCPaintbrush and AEASYAS! And, as you said, almost
no banding.

Have you got a setup utility for the DJ500? I haven't been able to find
one on Internet (simtel20, etc), and I thought you might have such
a beasty. If not, I'll probably just write a 4DOS BTM to do the
job. I think I want an 'envelope window' anyway (that's one nice
feature - my old printer had a narrow carriage that wouldn't accept
envelopes, so it was always a paint.).
