Happy Birthday! I intend to try Chinet again, thanks. Is the plural
for modem modi? John and I got tired of reading publications
yesterday, so we amused ourselves by doing computer administration.

Msg 45702 is 05 line(s) on 06/04/92 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/MEMORY INTERLEAVE

OK, I get it. What machines have this feature? I don't think
I've seen it widely advertised. And of course, that brings in the question
of how to define 'wait states.' My 325s has '0' wait states set in the
setup, but I gather that it ain't necessarily so. Can you amplify
thee distinction for me? Thanks -
