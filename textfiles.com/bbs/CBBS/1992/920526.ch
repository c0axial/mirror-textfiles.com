to SHAWN BRYANT re: FILES

 CBBS had really never had file transfer - it keeps people who
have messages to send or want to help answer, from using
the system. Since this is the world's first BBS, I'd rather people
get a chance to sign on and see a bit of history, than get a busy
signal because someone is DLing something they could get from
any of thousands of other places anyway.

to ARCADY KHOTIN re: R/HELLO FROM RUSSIA

 Oh, that's a big request - I'm not into writing long articles, and really
don't have thoughts about what's happened to BBSs. Unfortunately, in a way,
my "fame" has allowed me to be a guest on Compuserve and BIX, and because
of that I've spent virtually NO time on any other BBSs than this one.
 What do I think of the changes in your country? Well, sounds strange, but
I think the best is over. The "peak" was in overthrowing the old structure,
but now you're faced with reality of a -relatively- free-market society.
Heck, here even the company I work for has an office with a couple hundred
people and I think we've declared 27 people "surplus" and they'll be offered
other jobs in the "midwest area" (meaning up to hundreds of miles away), and
others encouraged to take an offer of compensation and leave the company.
I personally have been declared in the "upper half" of ranking so am not
worried, but things are MUCH tougher with a lot bigger emphasis on selling
our services.
 How does Clipper handle Cryllic?

Pardon the noise, but it's abad line from Schenectady.

Ward, I'm in love with my CompuAdd
Express machine!
Not only is the machine GREAT, but their SERVICE is good, too.
When the machine first arrived, it hgad some monitor
problems (image tilted slightly). I called them, and the next day
a new monitor (better quality) arrived from Texas, with
prepaid airfare for its sibling to go
back to texas. WOW. A week later I gave up on trying to
fix a problem with clock
drift. I called - and once again, they sent me out an
upgraded machine (2 extra MB of RAM). Thewy're fast,
DR DOS is SUPERIOR to MSDOS (hey, I used to use CP/M - I'm
surprised, too!), and the machine (now that teething is over) is very nice.

The Canon double drive is also neat - works just fine, and saves
a drive bay for other goodies.

I did get to do a little hardware hack (external). My office
hooks up to a VAX cluster through a Develcon Dataswitch. Now, the DSW
only looks at the following RS-232 lines - TD, RD, Sig Grnd, and DTR.
DR DOS has a built-in task switcher (speedy with all that RAM!), but it
forces DTR low when you switch away from a COM task. That meant that the
Dataswitch was hanging up on me, so backgrounding wasn't too useful. My
fix was to disconnect DTR from the computer, and wire the Dataswitch end
of DTR to a small Radio Schok power supply (nominal;
6 VDC). Now I have an eternal DTR ready! I LIKE THAT MACHINE (too
bad all I have at home is an original XT!).
