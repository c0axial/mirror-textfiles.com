to JOHN SERRANO re: R/WHAT TO DO WITH AN IBM 8512?

  Assuming (not sure I can!) that the 8512 has one main logic board and
that's what's wrong - or say one 'analog' board and that's what is wrong,
you could call IBM Parts at 303-924-4015 and get them to ID the part, then
call -4100 for parts ordering.
  NO, wait, no you can't.  IBM considers displays to be a single,
field-replaceable unit.  About all you could do is check with a dealer on
the replacement charge for the whole thing (i.e. they give you a credit
for the old one - IT goes to a plant for reconditioning).  Prolly not
worth the trouble.

I have never used a bulletin board before.  Am trying to find out for a
friend what OPUS is.  I have been told it is public domain software for
establishing a bulletin board.  If so, how is it available?

to ALL re: WINDOWS/DOS5/QEMM

I use a COMPAQ 386/25M, 4 Meg RAM, with Windows 3.0.  Also throw in the
complication of accessing IBM mainframe via Rabbit card.  Although I've
solved the problem of running emulator in a window, I get various kinds
of memory grief depending on whether I used QEMM or DOS CEMM any
suggestions?  By the time the emulator is loaded in I'm down to 499K
no matter what's loaded high.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: CD-ROM DRIVER

   Ward:

      I received the driver software that you had sent to me today
Saturday, February 1, 1992.

      I installed the software and it does work and does load high
for me.  I have not had any problems with it.  The version that you
had sent to me is 1.2 and the version that I got with the hardware
was 1.1.

      Thanks for your help.

Msg 45459 is 13 line(s) on 02/01/92 from ROY PLUM
to MICHAEL SHARTIAG re: R/POSTSCRIPT VS PCL

postscript printers do not print plain ascii files because the postscript c
code itself is recieved from the pc as plain ascii.  so,
without the code syntax that tells the printer to print text,
the printer assumes that all text comming in is programs.  When
you copy text to the prniter, all you get is the equiv. of a
syntax error.   To print an ascii file, then, you must first
download a command file that says, in effect, print the stuff that follows,
then download the file, then download an all-done command.  (This is instead
of any command that switch the printer into a different emulation.)
I have a file like this which should work with any postscript interpreter
along with a batch file that handles the details.  instead of 'copy file
lpt1:' you type 'textout filename'.   you can call me (708) 299-7426
(voice) for more info.

to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/4DOS 4.0

Don't use CP/M much any more.  Still have the machines in the office,
but I have a 386-40!  I could probably use a 22DISK definition for the
Advent format; I have some files on those disks, though I used DOSDISK
to move most of the files to DOS format disks when I put the 'DOS
machine to work in the office!

Yeah for 4DOS!  I couldn't live without it (well, no, not actually,
but let's say I'd never willingly give it up)!  I'm still unable to
understand why MS-DOS 5.0 and DR DOS 6.0 after all these years STILL
don't bother to tell the user the names of files that have been
erased with DEL!  Absolutely amazing!  (Or are they just trying to
leave something for JP to do?)

Msg 45461 is 10 line(s) on 02/01/92 from BENJAMIN COHEN
to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/3.5 OK WITH AT?

Check your SETP
oops.
Check your SETUP program.  See what options it has for disk
drives.  On mine (DTK PTM 1000), which I got from my brother,
I had only an option for low density 3.5 inch drive.  I was told that
I had to get a new BIOS to use a high density.  WRONG.  When my
brother gave me the second setup disk with a setup program that
had the high density drive listed, I could R/W high density disks
in the drive.  I got the $59 Sony at CompUSA and have been very
happy for over a year
