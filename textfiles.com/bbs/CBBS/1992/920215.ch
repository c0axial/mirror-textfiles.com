to AL HIGGINS re: DJ PAPER

I've had good luck with Hammermill Long Grain White Bond, available for
about $4/ream from Elek-Tek.  With laser or photocopy type paper, I've
found you get better print on the DJ if you put it in "bad" side down (
and therefore printed on)--it seems that the qualities that make paper
good for toner make it bad for ink, and vice versa.

to ERIC BOHLMAN re: R/DJ PAPER

I'll give it a try and see what happens! It's hard to keep paper
straight around here with two teenagers and a six year old, never
know where I'll find the paper let alone worry about the orientation
of the paper... But will give it a try.......

Msg 45483 is 04 line(s) on 02/14/92 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to WARD re: CBBS #1 PLACARD

Ward, if you have the time and inclination, would you put together a
placard saying something like "CBBS #1" for the party tomorrow?  I don't
have graphics-printer capability yet (much less color), but I'm working
on it.  Thanks.
No dup. chars.
