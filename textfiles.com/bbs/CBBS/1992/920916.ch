 That is REALLY strange! Only a del/rubout (hex ff or 7f) causes the
"old" (TTY-based) \chars\ echo. If you send ctrl-H, I'm really stumped
why CBBS would see a del key - must be your terminal emulation. What
program are you using?
 If you want to try an experiment, and you have BASICA or GWBASIC,
you could type in this trivial comm program. BASIC automatically buffers
incoming chars, so it should work. I use it when at a customer and I'm
trying to debug problems, as it eliminates all of the software issues.
10 OPEN "com1:2400,n,8,1" AS 1
20 X$=INKEY$
30 IF 0=LEN(X$) THEN 60
40 IF X$=CHR$(27) THEN END
50 PRINT #1,X$;
60 IF LOC(1)=0 THEN 20
70 PRINT INPUT$(1,LOC(1);
80 GOTO 20
 That's it. 30 tests for keystrokes, 60 for data from the modem.
It has no cursor, so it will look a bit funny, and to get out of it
you press ctrl-break.
 Thanks for putting up with this problem! Did CBBS always used to do
that? With the same comm program on your side?

 Rats, sorry to hear that! I'll have to ask randy to keep an eye on
CBBS, until such time as it can be made more solid - a rewrite for chinet,
perhaps?
 Also, I felt REALLY BAD about your forgetting the password on the
Ward Board - seems I was forgetting to check the log for a while, so it
seemed your pleas fell on deaf ears! Again, my apologies! It means a lot
to me to see you back here! Also can't believe we had 4 new-user calls in
a row! MD, Chi, Naperville, Park Ridge. CBBS's number must be published
around a bit. NOW, we need some good message threads! (using the terms
loosely).

 I checked - the Postscript option is supposed to S-H-I-P in early
October. So you're not likely to find someone with an opinion of it yet.

 Microcom sells the spec - I think for a nominal fee. I found someone
in Hayes willing to mail me a 6-page doc, we'll see what I get.

Ward, you were right. I'm using PROCOMM, and the configuration was set to
translate backspace to DEL. Everything's fine now. Sorry for the trouble.

Msg 45731 is 05 line(s) on 09/16/92 from MARTY DIPPEL
to WARD re: CONGRATS!

Glad you brought it back up again! I've really missed CBBS while it was down;
seems like seeing an old friend after a long time. Antique or not,
CBBS has a definite place, rest assured! Not only is it the world's
first, but the "compact" (terse) message style suits me better than the
constant drivel found on so many other boards. Thanks! -Marty.
