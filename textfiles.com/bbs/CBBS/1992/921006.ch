 Yep. That's the one. I jumped up and started to throw a salute
when I saw it. Didn't recognize you until I read your name on the
badge. Thought it was Col. Ollie North a first.

to CLIFF SHARP re: R/DISK FORMAT SOFTWARE

Don't have any suggestions, but one of the things that I have run into is
disks formatted by PS/2s to 1.44 megs WITHOUT the benefit of the second
hole punch that is "standard" for high density 3.5" disks. Apparently,
I'm told, IBM doesn't recognize the IBM/Sony standard in the PS/2s (or at
least didn't originally) and since 'DOS will format to high density
unless you tell it not to, the result is a disk that can't be read
on non PS/2s without punching a hole in them. FUN!

to CLIFF SHARP re: DONATIONS OF COMPUTERS

The Information Technology Resource Center (ITRC) provides computer
training and assistance to non-profit organizations in the Chicago
area. They have received donations of computers in the past that
they have passed on to some of their member organizations. They
are located at 59 East Van Buren, Suite 2020, Chicago, IL 60605-1219.
Their phone number is (312) 939-8050.

to CLIFF SHARP re: R/GOOF-PROOFING SYSTEMS

Cliff, my understanding is that DOS 5 does not require that IBM.SYS and
IBM.BIO reside in the first data clusters on the disk, nor that their
directory entries be the first on the disk. So what you thought was
"skillful damage" may have not been so at all. The real test would be
whether those two files were listed anywhere elsewhere in the directory.

This is not to belittle the "hacker pandemic." A salesman at Elektek says
that people try almost daily to crash the store's demo computers, or erase
files from them.

I'm not clear about the setup at the library you describe. Are you saying
that the public computers are equiped with a hard disk, but that patrons
are not supposed to have access to them? If so, I would consider a
hardware solution: Disable the hard disk by means of a lock-switch. If
you opt instead for a software solution, I would think the computers would
be vulnerable to any patron who brought his own boot diskette.

Msg 45779 is 15 line(s) on 10/06/92 from CLIFF SHARP
to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/GOOF-PROOFING SYSTEMS

 Well, the IBMBIO.COM and IBMSYS.COM files (?) were definitely missing
from the directory. I had had occasion to look at their directory
previously with DEBUG and noted that they were, indeed, the first two
entries in the directory, and occupied the first clusters on that drive.
That's why I say that whoever did this deed did it very skillfully, since
cluster 2 (which used to belong ot IBMBIO.SYS) now belonged to the DOS
directory.
 Since the patrons are indeed allowed access to the hard drives, we
can't just disable them. What I've settled on for the nonce is to remove
ATTRIB.COM from the drives, and use my own program to make the necessary
programs write-protected. But your ideas are VERY much appreciated, as
are those of the other people I haven't yet responded to.
 I suppose the best idea is to get them a pair of 21 MB tape backups,
by donation if possible, and enable them to restore the system to its
pre-cracker condition.

Msg 45780 is 03 line(s) on 10/06/92 from CLIFF SHARP
to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/DONATIONS OF COMPUTERS

 Roy, THANK YOU for the tip. I will call them today and see if they
might have some spare tape backups. (I will also keep them in mind if
I find a benificent donor who might have some "obsolete" equipment.)

Msg 45781 is 18 line(s) on 10/06/92 from CLIFF SHARP
to MURRAY ARNOW re: R/BOOKS

 I kinda figured that those books, being as valuable as they were, would
be really difficult to get. Unfortunately, the SLS, which got the books
on loan for me, is running into financial difficulties and now has to
charge a $10 fee for taking a book from one library to another, so I may
not get another chance at them for some time to come.
 I was REALLY surprised at the statement in the "Vacuum" book that not
only X-rays, but electron bombardment, can cause outgassing! No small
wonder the getter is needed. As for other incidental knowledge I gleaned
from those tomes, I always thought Pyrex glass was a trademark for a
glass that was resistant to cracking on expansion by temperature changes,
and noted in a footnote that "Pyrex" is actually a generic term for any
of 150 different glasses.
 BTW, it also improved my conversational ability with a friend who's
a plastics expert; now I can understand what he's saying to a better
extent, and I can even provide him with an occasional bit of knowledge
he didn't have! Neat.
 If for some reason you find any of those books in a used book store,
PLEASE let me know immediately! Thanks for the tips; VERY good reading.

 I've noticed this phenomenon with a bit of glee; isn't it interesting
when IBM comes out with non-IBM-compatible computers? Think back to the
first IBM portable. :-)

You may have some luck investigating the used book stores around the
University of Chicago. Best wishes.
