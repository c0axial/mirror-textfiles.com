]Hi guys...  thot it about time to swing by and say "hi!"

You may not have heard (word travels slowly), but CBBS/NW was down
for about a month due to a hardware failure.  Actually, still kind
of down as fas as the old system goes, as it's still broke.

So...  I have been experimenting with some new software and some new
ideas.  Fun to an extent, but I still get nostalgic...

I have not given up yet, but wanted to get a system back on the air,
so I guess I've strayed from the "one true course"...

Best wishes!
