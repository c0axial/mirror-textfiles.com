to ALL re: DUAL IDE DRIVES

 Well, today wasn't a good day - and not only because of the sore throat,
but because of the frustration of dual IDE drives.
 I got a new WD Caviar 200M to replace my 120M Seagate ST1144.
 What I wanted to do was put both in the system, with the WD as master,
so I could later remove the Seagate, and move it to another system whose
old MFM drive/controller failed.
 Do you put on the "master" jumper on the master, and the "slave" jumper
on the slave? No! In spite of the ST1144 having a "master" jumper
originally, it turns out (no docs came with drive!) that "slave" means
"Slave PRESENT" and is only to be used when the drive is a MASTER!
 SO the "master" jumper on the WD was what worked with both, and after
moving things over, I had to remove THAT to allow the drive to work alone.
 Randy's suggestion of leaving both drives OUT OF THE CASE until the
problems were solved, was a good one!

Yep.I had the same kind of problem with a pair of 120M cumulus drives
and resorted to the same solution (set jumpers until it all works). I
had instructions but were ambiguous about the slave jumper on/off,
slave or master.
