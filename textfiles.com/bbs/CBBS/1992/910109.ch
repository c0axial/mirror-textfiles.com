  No, I didn't mean a REAL audio cassette - I mean the "audio cassette type",
with the notch.
  Anyway, THE DRIVE CAME IN!  It is WONDERFUL!
  For anyone looking over our shoulders: this is a QIC 80 drive, from
Microsolutions in DeKalb, but we bought it thru Comark (-mart?) - it was
only $400.  A DC-2000 tape holds 80M uncompressed - they squeeze 28 tracks
into that little tape!  With compression it can go higher - but for example
I got 1.6:1 on my 120M drive, and only 1.1:1 on another drive - which
mostly contained compressed files (diskette images using a special program).
  It ran about a meg a minute from a laptop - INCLUDING VERIFY, and when
I backed up 79M on my 120M partition, it took 50 minutes WITH compression,
so by compressing, it didn't take as much time.
  The software is very straightforward, and quite nice.  Allows going thru
the directory tree, tagging by directory, or filename, etc.  I did a
"fire drill" and erased some unimportant files, then restored them from
the backup - it was fine.
  I really recommend this.  I'm not ALL that thrilled with these little
DC-2000/2120 drives - because I've had several tapes "eaten", but I think
it might have been the DEI tapes - they seem to 'squirm' off of the spindle
after a dozen or so uses - eventually wrinkling the tape and thus causing
errors.  I should bite the bullet and just throw 'em all away, and buy a
bunch of Sony's (though Colorado - my tape at home - doesn't have them on
their recommended list - I think Sony didn't come thru with eval units for
'em; and Sony is the most readily available type - CompUSA and Computer
Discount Warehouse).

  My brain hurts.  What is the name of that protocol/software that allows
pictures to be sent interactively - like Prodigy?  I think under the covers
it uses NAPLPS, or ?? - can't believe the name won't come to me.  TEL.some-
thing - I think they use it in Europe.
  A service-oriented company would like to expand their dial-in service
from simple char-oriented mode to a more interesting graphics oriented one.
  Thanks for any ideas!

Nope, you didn't read anything about mandatory donations when calling
our BBS.

That's not VIDEOTEX or VIDEOTEXT, is it?  (Or is that ancient history?)

Msg 45408 is 01 line(s) on 01/09/92 from DON PIVEN

Telidon maybe?  (No info; the name just sticks.)

to ALL re: CANAPPLELZRPRT>IBM?

Does anyone know if I can use an Apple Laser printer on my IBM?
I understand the NT series is Postscript, serial connections, and that the
LS model is Apple Mac only. But that's all I know.
Any comments would be apprieciated!
