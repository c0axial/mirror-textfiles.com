  Speaking of "high resolution" CGA, the biggest scam I've seen lately
is some of these mail-order companies advertising "VGA" and having
something like a forty-something mm dot pitch?  Or was it 50?

  Uh, that's not typically how it works...  If you have a question, ask it,
giving lots of details (e.g. what kind of computer, what operating system,
what language, what version of compiler or interpreter for that language,
etc.  THEN call back to see if anyone answered.  I have programmed in
APL, Cobol, Assembler on several platforms, BASIC, C, Pascal, Fortran,
and I don't recall "SEQ Filesd", sorry.
  Also you said to "call you at home" and didn't leave an area code...
Please think about the messages you leave and how EFFECTIVE they would
be to read and whether they encourage answering or not.  I'm not trying
to discourage you from CBBS usage, just trying to help you get the most
out of it

  Last I heard was something like "three tracks" which would typically
be the partition block, boot sector, file allocation table, and root
directory.  Without a partition table, most programs won't even let you
look at the disk.  Without a FAT, you don't know where the 2nd-nth cluster
of a file is, and without a directory, you don't know where the first is.
  The BEST possible thing would be to have ASCII data that you're looking
for and as a result be able to follow cluster chains manually such as a
cluster ending in "Novem" would be matched to one beginning "ber the 2nd",
for example.
