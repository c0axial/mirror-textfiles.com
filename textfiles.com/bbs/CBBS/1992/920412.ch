  The version of SI that you have IS important.  However, there is no such
thing as "SI may not recognise cache outside of the chip."  Cache is just
there, and works.  If SI is executing instructions and determining your
machine speed from that execution, it "must" use the cache.  While I'd
love to know that 51 is what you get from a 64K cache, and that because
I have 256K, I get 72, I think more likely we are just a few % apart,
because cache has a diminishing returns role as it goes from 8K to 64K
to 128 to 256.

  Well, just got back from 4 busy days @ Comdex.
  I had volunteered my time AMs at the IBM booth, and wound up spending
most of the day - in the OS/2 2.0 "Test Drive" area.  The response was
generally very favorable.  OS/2 was "quite robust" which doesn't mean
we didn't ever have to reboot - but more that people were "unconsciously
abusing it" by opening up things, then minimizing them (not CLOSING them).
Thus it was not uncommon for me to walk up after someone and find 27 things
opened (well, more like 16 ;-)
  Toshiba's little $8000 486 color laptop was the "machine of choice".
  I got a chance to REALLY type on IBM's new laptop - I was surprised, and
haven't decided yet: IBM moved the keyboard a bit further "up" in the
machine.  I found thus I couldn't rest my palm on the table and reach the
home row comfortably.  Instead sort of the "front of my wrist" rested on
the edge of the computer.  I haven't decided if I like that or not.
Karpal Tunnel syndrom comes from having the wrist too low, I think so
perhaps IBM has it right... it is only because the front of my Toshiba
is so thin that I can readily use it with palms on the table.
  I talked to Intel about replacing a 486 with the DX/2, and they said it
wouldn't be offered to end-users.  One thing (I'd not thought of) is that
apparently BIOSes have timing loop - and he said just replacing the chip
won't work.  (I don't remember if he said "won't usually" or "won't always"
or what).
  Windows was "real big" - didn't see anything particularly that pulled
my chain, EXCEPT, "Fractal" software's painter.  It does an OUTSTANDING
job of doing thing like "water color" with either painted or scanned
images.  It has charcoal drawing, textured paper, friskit (sp?), etc.  The
air-brush was VERY nice.  It was demoed with a Wacom tablet, that has the
3rd axis - i.e. pressure sensitive.  This makes it a darned good drawing
tool!  Even hand-written text was quite good.  I think I'll get it.

Now that I've had the 500C for several months, I have several empty
cartridges.... I've been reading where there are services that
refill them, or you can purchase a kit (blue or black) and re fill them
yourself... I was wondering if you or anyone else has tried refilling
the cartridge, or have had them refilled??? As for myself, I would like
to find some other colors other than black and blue, like RED or Green, or
maybe an Orange.  We use soem of the color toner cartridges at work and
they work great... However, they do not do the little HP jet cartridges.
No demand I'm told!!!! Any information you or other have would
be helpfull on this subject!
Thanks -

Yeh, I remember reading about the return on increasing cache...some
estimates have it at 3% for going from 64K to 128K. That's why I
suspect my SI is the culprit. It's dated 1987!!! Also, most other tests
I've run show 2- to 4-fold improvements. Oh well! This is the cross a
speed freak must bear, I guess. I would really like to see a broad
set of "benchmark" test programs assembled, and then run and cataloged
amoung all of us "BBS'rs", but no one else seems to be adding any
comments to ours. It might be of use to those considering a new machine,
or trying to identify a "best" configuration for their own system to
be able to have a body of data to compare to. Any thoughts? Regards...

During the past several months, our OEM group at work as run benchmarks
against the systems were are currently selling, and some of the new
system platforms we plan on selling in the future... They used several
commercial sw packages ie norton, PC Tools, Checkit, to name a few.
They also looked at how long it took to perform print a series of
graphical reports using Excell and PM. The results were intresting,
but to complex to quote back to you gentlemen here. I will see if
I still have a copy and see what they did in detail.
The one thing I DO remember, there were some major desparities about
the results with the commercially available software. Will let you know!
