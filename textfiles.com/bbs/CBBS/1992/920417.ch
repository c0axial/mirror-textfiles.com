to ALL re: VICTOR 9000 FOR SALE

Victor 9000 8086 with dual floppies(not PC compatible format)
and (again non PC compatible) good monochrome graphics.
It has built-in serial and parallel ports.
This machine is working, and comes with all manuals, old DOS, assembler,
and editor, I think a C compiler, basically a good learning tool for
software..... Make me an offer (200.00???)

Msg 45598 is 02 line(s) on 04/16/92 from CRAIG COLBY
to SYSOP re: THIS BBS PROGRAM?

Is this program, available for the IBM compatibles, or is it no longer being
made & supported?

Msg 45599 is 04 line(s) on 04/17/92 from RICHARD HINTON
to ALL re: OS2 2.0?

I don't like Windows but I was wondering about OS-2? People
on other boards says it is just like Windows or does the same
things better? Any comments?

to ALL re: COMPUADD EXPRESS

Has anyone out there any experience with CompuAdd Express?  Their
price for a 25 MHz 386SX seems pretty good, and I like a lot of
the features of the (regular) CompuAdd machines, so I thought I'd
just query  as to whether anyone had anything BAD to say about
the outfit.  In case you're interested, their current model 325s (386SX
at 25MHz, 40 MB drive, 14" HRVGA setup, dual floppy, 2MB exp -> 16, etc,
sells for $1295, which is less than I paid for
my trusty Kaypro 2'84.  SIGH.  Unless someone has something REALLY bad
to say, I think I'm gonna get out my checkbook...
No dup. chars.
