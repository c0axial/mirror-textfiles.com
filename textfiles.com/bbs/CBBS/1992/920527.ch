 Hey, you can drop in a 386-SX with 1M for maybe $200! Sure, you'll want
super VGA, 120M hard disk, tape backup, multi-sync monitor, but 'ya gotta
start your upgrades SOMEWHERE! I went with a new motherboard for a while,
but then you see a case with power supply for <$100, why keep the old case?
(etc)
 If you have any budget at all - and any NEED - at home, look into some
upgrades.

Is it possible to add a second hard drive to a SCSI host adapter
that is using the IBMINT13.I13 driver in OS/2? To be specific,
I'm using a Procom Technology CCE-16 adapter in my generic
386sx-20. I have an ST-296N 83 mb hard drive, and I'd like to
get a second one. Should I expect any problems?

Thanks

 I know people having trouble with an IDE and a SCSI as D, but dunno
about 2 SCSI's. I'll ask around.

Hi, there, I was just dropping by. Saw your system's number in an
old issue of Boardwatch magazine, and I wanted to see what the the
first BBS system looks like. I see you have been here for many years
whereas I have just gotten into the business of sysoping a year ago.
Very nice system and hope to see it last!

I also want to ask, is BBS advertising permitted? Since you have users
interested in programming, they may be interested in my system (a
programming-oriented system).

Type to ya later!

 Anyone else get the MS C/C+ 7.0 & Windows SDK 3.1 offer in the
mail for $139 (plus S/H and tax)?
 Sounds good to me, especially with the graphics tools I have
(multi language). Called around and even Egghead won't carry that
locally with the special price, have to get it from MS.

Am thinking of jumping to a 33 from a 16 mHz 386, but with
another manufacturer's board (Vektron). The price for a
-386-33 with 8 meg is $530.00. Is it worth jumping
to the 33 from the 16? Richard Hinton
