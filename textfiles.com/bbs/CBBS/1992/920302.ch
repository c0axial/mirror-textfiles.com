                       DIGITAL CLOCK BUG
                       -----------------

Today being February 29th has those digital clocks that doesn't
know what year it is... into thinking today is March 1st and they
are all wrong. Maybe those of us that has some of these clocks
should adjust them today back to February 28th so the next
days to follow will be correct. Now remember to do the very same
thing four years from now.

The Michelangelo Virus:
-----------------------
It's Almost March 6, Do You Know Where Your Data Is?

The Michelangelo Virus is poised to strike very soon. You
may find a nasty surprise on March 6 and find all your
files on the hard drive all gone. Of course unless your
protected.

Remember this virus has made it through commericial software
channels... so be careful!

This virus can also capable of affecting non-DOS systems running
OS/2 or UNIX that uses IBM-type BIOS, claims Dick Lefkon (head of
the Anti-Virus Method Congress).

Hey? I like that silly bell!      ;-)

to DON PIVEN re: R/WINDOWS SCREEN BLANKER

Thanks, that's probably a good suggestion, though it ought to have
occurred to those involved to suggest it, too.  Isn't it wonderful
how Windows simplifies things and makes them easy?
No dup. chars.
