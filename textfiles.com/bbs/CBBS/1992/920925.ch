to GEORGE LIMBERG re: R/MNP TECHNICAL DATA

 I have received the MNP data from a friend at Hayes. I'm working on
scanning it in and converting to ASCII. You still interested?

Msg 45746 is 02 line(s) on 09/24/92 from CLIFF SHARP
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/MNP TECHNICAL DATA

 If George isn't still interested in the MNP stuff, I sure would be
(well, even if he _is_).

Msg 45747 is 10 line(s) on 09/25/92 from CLIFF SHARP
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/COLORADO TAPE DRIVES

 I installed a Jumbo 250 for a friend/client a while back (may even
have mentioned it to you before). We heeded the manual's warning to use
only 3M or Colorado's own brand (I believe; that's from memory), opted
to stick with the 3M tapes, and there hasn't been a single error in all
the months he's used it. (Believe me: his secretary would call me on the
slightest indication that ANYthing is wrong with the computer! On second
thought, so would he.) The only problem is that he tends to buy the
unformatted tapes and then expects me to sit there for hours formatting
them for him; he's gonna be reeeeeal surprised when I start charging him
by the hour for the service. :-)
