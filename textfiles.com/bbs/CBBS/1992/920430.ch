You think looking for OS2 utilities for the your computer is hard
to find after using MS-DOS. You ought to try running a Commodore
128 for years and then going to MS-DOS. MS-DOS seems like it has
nothing available after using the surplus of 6502 utilities.

Does anybody use utilities like QDOS v2.0 and Xtree v2.0 anymore, or

continued to look into the issue of defrag.
of the disk. In my case, our applications were written in FAT
file format. We've talked to Norton twice this week and it
looks like we can use Norton 6.0 as long as we boot DOS, run
Norton use the utili and then boot to OS2.
If this works.... this will solve my biggest problem disk
defragmentation... As for other Norton utilities, I don't
k on OS2.k on
If I can get a spare system, or clean up the hard disk, I
will try to add DOS in PM and see if I can go from OS2 to DOS
and run norton. The problem I have had in the past is our
application requires that we have DOSSWAP OFF. Looks as if
I'll have to play for a while and see what we can get to
work or not work....

School, must be at least 7 or 8 years ago.

  ] Marie runs halfway houses; one of the problems that comes up is
  ] dyslexia.  She feels that a talking computer could be useful there
  ] also.

  ] Her home computer is Macintosh, but the halfway houses are using

to ALEX ZELL re: R/COPH

Well I realize this is the wrong computer platform, but the following
information can be of some good for someone. I know that a Commodore
64 has a number of cards that allows your computer to talk. One even
allows your computer to listen too. In fact, the card manufacturer is
called: Hearsay, Inc; 1825 74th Street; NY, NY 11204; and they made
IBM version too. I am not sure if they did for the MAC or not.

Now I know that there are some educational programs that work very
well with the above mentioned cards on the C64. There is also an
excellent word processor that even talks called "The Write Stuff" and
works without any extra hardware. Also there is a communications
program called SAMTERM, but it is really slow. You even had to hit
CTRL-S once in awhile even at 300 baud, so the term could keep up
with the BBS.

You ask how long messages are retained here.  They remain until they
are removed by the original author, the addressee, or Ward or an assistant
operator, who take them off the top when the active message base
approaches its limit.  If you do r;1 you will see that at this time
the messages go back to Oct 1991.

I did a R;1 command and it told me that message 1 wasn't found. I typed
the plus key to scan for the next 10. Still nothing. I pressed the plus
key about 5 more times and I finally gave up and typed S;1 and it
reported the first message number was 45169. So to make an already long
story short... just type R;45169 to see the first message.    ;-)
