]Ward,
I will try to place more legible messages in the future.  My biggest
problem continues to be connections to the 545/777 switch.  I have
called about 8 times today, and now (11:00pm) is the first connect
clear enough to read anything. It seems that whatever I type is OK
without garbadge.
As it appears that no one else is having this problem and
I do not have problems with other boards, Such as Tony A.'s and
other places I frequent, I assume it is Ma Bell but she
has been very un-cooperative.  I have called 611 5 times
to date with no fix.  Do you know of another route to take?
I I remember seeing a message a long time ago realing
to a minimum line quality they must provide and a specific
test that could be requested to verify this level.
If you have any info that would help, let me know.  My home # is
708-432-1070

 DRIVER.SYS in your DOS manual talks about the various drive settings -
depends upon the version of DOS. I DO know that early AT's could NOT
have a 1.44M drive without a special driver - which was not readily
available.
 My DOS manual is so old (at least the one I have handy) that it
doesn't address 1.44, sorry - check your manual.
 P.S. would you mine just a couple space indents on a new paragraph?
makes the msg more readable. 'preciate it!

DRIVPARM wasn't ever defined by IBM, so PC-DOS doen't have it. but
of course has DRIVER.SYS. DRIVPARM was nicer in that it didn't take
more memory.
 P.S. if you can think of any folks, I'd sure like to get some old
CACHE folks at the Chinet/CBBS 15th anniversary party on Feb 13th.
I'm in tough with Krystosek, Precht, Suess, Roger Hale, can you think
of others you're still in touch with? Oh, Randy and I were trying
to remember, just popped into my mind: "Bill Basset".
 I'll check out one of the old listings - I think I've got one back to
the late 70's, but not sure.

Ward - did you ever get an ideal keyboard? I saw another Northgate
ad and it reminded me. BTW, their keyboards were used almost
exclusively in the film SNEAKERS; possibly because they have the right
sound. They didn't get any credits!
