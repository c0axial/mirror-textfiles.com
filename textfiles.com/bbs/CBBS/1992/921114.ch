 No, can't say I saw it as faster than an LJ, but then again I've never worked
with an LJ. Perhaps what happens is you see output STARTING sooner. Are
you saying it is faster to COMPLETE a page?
 > Utility to setup the DJ:
 Well, yes and no. I went thru the book when I got my first DJ, and
used my editor to make 1-line of each font change that was supported -
then I got the idea to make a "program" out of it, which means I could type
"fs" (Font Select), cursor to a particular description (such as "Courier
6-point 20 pitch"), and press enter. This sends the set-up string to the
printer so that next application will print in that font.
 However, the "program" is a custom version of my PMATE editor, so the
setup program isn't really portable.
