Msg 45656 is 17 line(s) on 05/13/92 from BILL WOLFF
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/IDE INFO

Hi Ward! Well hopefully I am suppose to use MS-DOS' format command. As
I just received my IDE-HD back from the shop. They replace it with one
that has PROTOTYPE stamped on it (oh boy?!?). Anyway, I couldn't get
it to do anything when I got it. As I could log on the hard drive, but
couldn't access, copy, read, or anything with it. Even when I tried to
partition the drive, the computer locked up! So I used MS-DOS' format
and everything started working. Format reported 65536 bytes bad for
every partition I made and I assume that's IDE protecting those
sectors, because other programs like CHKDSK and Norton's DISK TEST
reports no bad sectors. Though one partition was different as format
reported it had 83968 bytes in bad sectors. CHKDSK says it only has
18432 bytes in bad sectors (Norton also reported bad sectors in that
partition as well). If you subtract 83968 from 18432 you get 65536.
Isn't that interesting? May I assume that my IDE drive is saving 65536
bytes from DOS for bad sectors for each partition, though one spot on
my drive has 83968 in bad sectors and 65536 bytes are hidden and 18432
bytes exposed to DOS?

any others. I like computer games but unfortunately I don't have any yet.
