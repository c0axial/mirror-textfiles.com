to LANE LARRISON re: R/DATA RETREIVAL

  No, sorry, never heard of them.  Interesting though!  I have some
"developer" which is a very fine suspension of iron particles (or ferrite
or something - but "very fine") in a (probably noxious) liquid.
  What you can do is spray it on a diskette, or magnetic train ticket,
or credit card, or audio tape, or anything where you want to see WHERE
the info is.  The problem is, since the days of 556 BPI tape drives, the
stuff isn't fine enough to actually see the bits.  For example, my latest
hard drive has 1700 TRACKS per inch, and - WOW!  glad I had to look this
up!  Forty-six THOUSAND bits per inch!
  "Chemically" I'd have to think is some process that allows the bits to
be "seen"... perhaps some kind of optical microscope automatically reads
the bits.  "chemically" could mean that they mix two liquids, which
precipitates out molecular iron, which being so small, would "stick
to the bits on the disk", then perhaps be died - fluorescently? - at
least that's how I'd "invent" a way to read a disk that was mechanically
unsuitable for reading (grin).
  Sorry I didn't know of the company.

to ANN PELZ re: R/PEN PAL

Dear Brandon,
        I live in Barrington IL. I am 14 but I will be 15 in a few months.
I enjoy computers and computer games very much too. I just got my modem
a few days ago and CBBS  is the first BBS I  could find. I  could not find
any others. I like computer games but unfortunately I don't have any yet.
You see, I got my computer from my aunt and it's basically a buisness
computer and it doesn't work with all IBM software, mostly games.
I  also like comic books and science fiction books and movies.
write me back
Gerry Swanson

to WARD AND RANDY re: THANK YOU

Thank you. I had my modem for two weeks and I  had a little problem.
The books at our library had many numbers for BBS's but none of them
existed anymore. Fortunately I found your number in several of them
and I called it. I  found numbers for several other BBS's and now I
"have the world at my fingertips." I hope to meet some people who
have the same interests as I do, mainly computers. I am fluent in basic
and I  hope to write software to make my own BBS. I think it would fun
to
look at other peoples messages they leave and I like to make things.
You obviously like that too because you've been doing this for 13 years.
If you have any tips could you tell me them?
sincerely,
G. Swanson
