 Well, I'll open the bidding (on answering your Q's) with a LITTLE bit
of info - others will supply the details (grin).
 Most IDE drives use ZBR - Zone Bit Recording. This means that the
number of sectors/track varies! The purpose is like the older Mac floppies:
to keep the recording density more constant. Since the inside tracks of
a hard disk (or floppy) are "shorter" (in circumference), it makes sense
to slow down the clock a bit, and write at the same BIT DENSITY.
 This means that a format program that builds a traditional WD type
controller TRACK in memory then does the track format, won't work.
 Some IDE drives will be hosed up by a low level format. Some will simply
return a response "Done!" when in fact they didn't do anything. AND, a
FEW are truly low-level-formattable.
 I don't have details (I don't know which drives are able to be low-
level formatted, etc).

That makes a lot more sense to me! Thanks!

I'm in the process at looking at 486 motherboard replacements. Does
anyone out there have any comments on AIM vs. DTK vs. Micromics or others.
If I'm going to spend the $ I would like to make a good choice, and
not just a clone maker that makes a motherboard with a 486 chip in it!
It appears almost all the boards use AIM bios, and some boards can
address 16 MB, some 32 MB and others 64 MB. Any comments??
