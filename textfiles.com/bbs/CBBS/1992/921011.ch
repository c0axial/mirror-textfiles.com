to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/ALL COMMAND.COM'S IDENTICAL?

DIR of my DOS 5.0 command.com is:
COMMAND COM 47845 04-09-91 5:00a
 This is for MS-DOS Version 5.00.
 If I remember I'll try to check at work for IBM-PC-DOS.

Msg 45789 is 05 line(s) on 10/10/92 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to TONY ANTONUCCI re: MODEM/FAX CARD

 Which card did you get? I'm not "very" interested in Fax, but there
are times when it would be nice. Actually I just - perhaps foolishly -
bought a Hayes Optima 9600, and didn't spend the extra to go get Fax
with it.
 What are you using for Software?

Msg 45790 is 01 line(s) on 10/11/92 from BILL CLOHERTY
to ALL re: CRC-32 (CCITT)

Can anyone give the slow algorithm for CRC-32 (CCITT)?

Msg 45791 is 03 line(s) on 10/11/92 from BILL CLOHERTY
to ROY LIPSCOMB re: COMMAND.COM

COMMAND.COM for DOS 3.3 is 25644 bytes long and is
dated 7/26/90 3:00 PM. 32 bit CRC is A95CFB19.
What position in the module is the error level located?
dup. chars.
