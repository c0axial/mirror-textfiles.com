Msg 45794 is 15 line(s) on 10/12/92 from ROY LIPSCOMB
to WARD/BILL CLOHERTY re: R/ALL COMMAND.COM'S IDENTICAL?

Ward, my DOS 5.0 also has COMMAND.COM AS 47845 bytes,
but the date/time is 11-11-91 5:00.
Bill, my DOS 3.3 COMMAND.COM (Zenith) is listed as
25532 in length (vs your 25644). In my edition of DOS 3.3
COMMAND.COM, the errorlevel is at offset 0BEA
(when COMMAND.COM is loaded. The file offset is
100H less).
 Incidentally, to locate that byte, I used a trick
Ward suggested years ago for locating the USER
byte in the CP/M BDOS: Set the USER to one value,
copy the BDOS, set the USER to another value, copy
the BDOS again, compare the two copies to find
the byte that differs and reflects the two USER
values that you individually set.
 Thanks for your responses.

to RANDY SUESS re: QUESTION ON GUEST ACCESS

Randy,
When you have guest access on 283-0559, (login evans) I don't quite
understand if guests can post to the net at all (or just on
weekends). Your message on this was not clear to me.
If I want to post do I need contributor access, or are guests just
limited to certain time slots? My internet address is
evans@ihlpm.att.com.
Thanks for the help.
Dan
