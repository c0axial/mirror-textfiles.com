]Ward, thought you might be interested, when I called in earlier, I
ended up at the end of "ALEX"'s session. It seems that something went
wrong, and that the system did not recognize the modem hang up.
Cheers.....

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: CD-ROM DRIVER.SYS

Ward the last time I had talked to you was over the telephone about being
able to load the CD_ROM dirver "IBMCDROM.SYS" module into high memory
using the PC-DOS 5.0 methof or Qualitas Blue Max 6.0.  I have had no
luck in doing so.  I also asked you if IBM had a version of the module
that could be loaded into high memory.  I believe the "IBMCDROM.SYS"
module that I have is version 1.0.  I hope this helps some.

Thanx

I have an original 6MHZ AT and need to get a 3.5 drive on it.
Will a low density 3.5 work on it?  Will a high density 3.5 work on it?
How about a high density 3.5 being run at low density?  Can it run
under DOS 3.2?  Thanks much.

Greetings.  I'm currently working for a tax law retrieval company that uses
telecommunications with a system located around San Francisco.  We have been
working to improve our communications and your name has come up.  Are you
a consultant?  I'm just trying to get information so that if the powers
that be start making these noises again I can say whether it is worth bother
-ing you about.  Later.

to ALL re: DOS APPS 2 WINDOWS NEED HELP

I'm a consultant who has a good grasp of c and DOS, and may have to
assist a client in migrating a software package they have developed
to a Windows (MS, not X) environment.  Any help in pointing me in
the direction of useful information would be greatly appreciated.
  I'm familiar with the basic problem of non-tiny memory models
needing to correctly find their pages, as they may have been swapped
by the OS, but more detail, plus any other tips would be greatly app-
reciated.  If you'd like to do some of the work, and I can expand the
project, that's a possibility, too.  But right now, I just need enough
of a jump start to convince them that I'll be able to identify and
tackle the bulk of such problems. Other Windows tips will be appreciated,
but the real problem is the nuts and bolts type of stuff that goes on
behind the scenes.
    Thanks much for any help
            DAN GOODMAN
PS will call back later to see what's up, or call and leave a
message for me at 703-883-0279, if you're really gung ho.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/HP DESKJET 500 INKJET PRINTE

Well.... Its hear. I found out the DJ is a little more fussy with the
type of paper one can use in it. The HPIID at work prints good on
good ole zerox paper, except the DJ500/C it seams to bleed a little.
So it looks like I'll have to purchase some higher grade paper.
Also, FYI, HP just came out with a high capacity print cartridge.
Just hit ET today there $23.99 as apposed to 15.xx for a regular
black cartridge. The high capacity cartridge is suppose to be aprox
twice what a normal one is!

soaked and cleaned it with alcohol. Now it shows full characters.

to ALL re: POSTSCRIPT VS PCL

I amworking with a new printer, and it has both postscript and PCL 4.0
available on it.  Windows and the related programs for it seem to work/
print better and quicker through postscript than PCL.  However, it
seems that in postscript mode, plain old ASCII is simply ignored (
as in copy file.txt lpt1:)
This also means that olde programs such as Dbase III are going to be a
real problem.  I have a utility that will print an ASCII file to the
printer form the manufacturer.  However, it does not provide a 'real time'
solution.  Have I overlooked something simple here?  Is there an
'ASCII' command to issue postscript prior to sending data?
No dup. chars.
