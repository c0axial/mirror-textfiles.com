]Owell. Another enthusiast who doesn't read before he posts.
I'll let him know about all the good "risks" and "emergency
services" stuff on usenet -- via chinet, of course.

  Someone on BIX suggested that Corel Draw particularly, uses HUGE swap
files - so I switched my swap file from a drive with 17M open, to one
with 60M open.  I didn't get any problems in about 1/2 hour's use - dunno
if that is it but at least no problems so far!  Will tell after a week
or so (if I do more Corel).

Understand, I was apparently using some cheap paper, bought several
reams of lazer quality from $3.45 to $4.99 and all seams to work well.
On another subject.... I printer soP tables and graphs tonight, took
a long time to print them out but they looked GREAT! The 500C
was a great investment.....

  Ward, you mentioned that you had bought a MicroSolutions external
backup drive.  Today I needed to know whether it worked undESQview,
but their support line is closed for vacation.  So I ask: will your new
drive, or any others, work under DESQview 386 while a program is running
in another window?  Colorado says theirs won't, and Quarterdeck doesn't
know of any that will, but maybe they haven't heard of DeKalb.
No dup. chars.
