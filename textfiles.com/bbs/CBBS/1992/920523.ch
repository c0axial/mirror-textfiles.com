 Yep, still running the board - ancient though it is.
 You use the term "E-mail" as if we had some great infrastructure here in
the "states" that connected lots of people - but actually I know of no such
thing. I have some friends at a small company, and I can get to them
via Compuserve, using >MHS:name@node which is the Novell (?not even sure?)
Mail Handler Service. Other companies, are on Compuserve directly (Borland,
Microsoft, Norton, Fox, etc). Some companies - such as GREAT technical
support for tape drives from Colorado, are supported by individuals with no
forum on Compuserve. BUT I'm not sure how you get to/from the internet and
Compuserve - I think there are IDs, but as a sponsored Compuserve Sysop it
turns I'm not ALLOWED to access the Internet (perhaps there is an extra
fee, I don't know).
 So, I'm not sure how you'd access various companies. It might help if you
contact them individually - admittedly slowly - by mail, and establish what
the best means is to contact them electronically.

Hi, Ward! Great to hear from you! You are very famous in my country -
phone lines are poor, we have to use protocols very wide . So, your
protocol is taught at every computer science college we have.
Many thanks for your comments, appreciate it.
Since I'm running BBS, I'd appreciate if you'd write a few words to my
users . We'd like to hear your ideas about BBS history and evolution,
future. What business are you in now, what plans do you have, what do you think
about changes in our country.
I know, I ask a lot - but hope you'd find some time to answer.
Hope to hear, Arcady Khotin.
Software developer, President of Clipper Users Group in St.Petersburg.

Hi Ward! I use Internet from CompuServe once in awhile. The syntax
is: INTERNET:whatever-the-internet-address. and that's it. To
send a message from Internet back, the syntax will be the following:
????.???@CompuServe.com. <<<< The ??? characters is the user ID
of the CompuServe user. Pretty simple, huh?

to JOHN STAPLES re: CHINET LOGIN

I hope you've had better success at logging in to Randy's board. Usually
7-1-E does the trick; terminal emulation doesn't matter unless you're
going for ANSI graphics output. Once connected, changing parameters on your
end doesn't matter; you have to call in again with the new parms on your
terminal emulator. Sometimes the lines are flakey
on chinet; I can't always get in either. Persevere. I hope you take the
time and effort necessary to log in; I'd really enjoy exchanging EMAIL.
If you like, I can also give you an account on the Silicon Graphics system
at work. -not much there for PCs, but we do have a USENET connection as
well as being an INTERNET site. Hope to see you at the bike trip in June.
John said he wasn't sure if you could make it or not -hope so. I plan on
it so far- if I make it, it'll be the first one in about three years.
It'll be good to see the gang again.
