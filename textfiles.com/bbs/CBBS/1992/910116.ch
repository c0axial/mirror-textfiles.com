to ALL re: WINDOWS LOCK UP

  After running Windows, I can no longer access my Lantastic server.
  Worse, AFTER REBOOTING I can STILL not access it!  Only if I RESET
or POWER OFF the "redirector" can I get back on the server!  Windoze
must be doing something AWFULLY funky to the CPU chip to have ctrl-alt-del
NOT get it to come back!
  The lan adapter is Lantastic's AE2 10MB ethernet.  It has no ROM/RAM,
just ports and IRQ, and I've tried different ones.

Msg 45418 is 05 line(s) on 01/16/92 from KEN STOX
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: WINDOWS LOCK-UP

What might be happening is that the controller on the LAN-tastic card
is getting hosed, ie. internal registers are munged. My guess would be
that the only way to reset these is via a hard reset. I
have not used this card, but you might want to take a look at the registers
using a debugger before and after it locks up.
No dup. chars.
