to ALL re: KEYBOARDS

Anyone know a PC keyboard that is 100% compatible with IBM's enhanced
layout (I don't want \ key in funny place - I want it below [ <- ]) and
I want a "small" enter key (for if I have a large enter key, then \ gets
put somewhere "funky").
 ===> AND. that has a switch for swapping control and caps?
 .and that does NOT do ANYTHING funky like add a left column of PC-style
function keys? I'm tired of inconsistency in how programs handle ctrl-caps
swapping, particularly under OS/2.

I'm glad you asked. I have been a Geoworks user since the product was
introduced in 1990. It is the only GUI that can multitask on a XT.
The Pro upgrade incorporates a Quattro Pro file viewer so your work
done there can be used in your documents. The word processor is moderately
good to great, lacking a thesaurus and mail merge capabilities. Geocomm,
the communications software is great (I'm calling here on it!), and the
rolodex-like GeoDex interfaces with GeoPlanner for great appointment and
task tracking. GeoDraw has powerful graphics features. You can import
import PCX or TIF bitmapped pictures easily. They just came out with a
software development kit, so vendors will begin to write programs for it
soon (the Geoworks people say to me.). I know I'm looking forward to
that. Try it out and let me know what you think of it.

to ALL re: 80287 COPROCESSOR PROBLEMS

I just bought a 80287 coprocessor today. Upon bootup, I get a 80287 internal
register error. I have a 1989 Quadtel Bios and there is no place on the
setup to initialize for the coprocessor. In fact, the manual that came
with the coprocessor says it should be automatically detected by the
system, and it is. So what's with this error and how do I fix it?

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/CD ROMS

Sorry for such a tardy reply. I haven't been on local BBSes much
lately. <G>
 I haven't evaled CD drives under OS/2 yet, sorry. IBM
sent me an eval copy of OS/2, but I have yet to install it.
 I've received a few eval copies of shareware OS/2 apps,
utils, etc., but at the moment they're just resting among my
collection gathering dust.
 Sorry I can't provide more useful info at the moment.
I probably _will_ be in a position to respond further in the
coming months. The editor of one mag for which I write a column
would like me to begin to work some OS/2 stuff into the
manuscripts, but I really need to upgrade my HD and RAM before
I jump into all that.
 Regards.
