 It really DOES sound like your chip has a problem! Try re-seating it,
maybe even check if you accidentally bent a pin under ('287s are a DIP
type chip, right?).
 No problem dropping by only when you have problems. Just glad to have
you here at all ;-)

to MAX KOHN re: HELP

 You asked for help on "last". Sorry, that IS a logical keyword, but I'd
not put it in the help file. The way you find your last call is that it
is symbolically called "*" for the high msg, or # for info on your last call.
 Thus you can do "r" then when asked for a msg #, you can reply *, and if
you just want to find statistics about your last call (date, time, hi msg
#) then use the "#" command.

Although I wouldn't call it a "Pubnet", CPSnet (Chicago Public Schools BBS)
currently is allowing access to Inet (E-mail, Telnet and FTP by mail)
for free. The system is running Magpie software under Unix. Number is
312-535-8513. I manage the Internet Issues board over there (messages
are stored on a tree basis). If/when you log on, enter "29 J" without

Hello OS/2'ers,
 As you are probably aware, the long awaited Service Pak (AP) is now
available via electronic downloading. If you don't have access to a
IBM SE and don't want to pay Compuserve the $200 to download the 20Mb
of diskette images I have an alternative solution.
I have both the 3.5" and 5.25" images and would be willing to produce a
copy for anyone who would supply the required number of blank diskettes.
It requires (14) 3.5" or (16) 5.25" diskettes. I live in Morton Grove, Il
which is just north of Chicago (9500 N and 7300 W). If you think you'd
like to make the treck out here some evening give me a call and we can
set up a date and time.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/80287 COPROCESSOR PROBLEMS

I tried re-seating the chip. No good. Error message persists.
I think it's a incompatibility problem. There is no place in my BIOS
setup to tell the system where the coprocessor is. According to what
I've read, the system SHOULD automatically detect the chip. Yet,
obviously, it is trying to use a part of memory already allocated to
another device. I seem to have a non-standard BIOS that doesn't have the
ability to allocate the same place in memory for devices as other systems do
and this causes me a lot of problems. I think I may eventually have to
replace my Quadel 1989 BIOS. <sigh> In the meantime, I will remove that
coprocessor and return it to the buyer. Thanks for your help.

By the way, what is a DIP chip? I didn't understand that reference. Thanx.

I left off in reading messages and the number of the last message I read.

 DIP = Dual Inline Package. Means a typical "old" chip. Newer chips
such as 386, 486, etc are something different - Pin Grid Array or something
like that. DIP's "dual" means two rows of pins, "inline" means all the pins
are in a row (on each side) - I don't know, I recall there were packages
that had staggered rows of pins, perhaps that's why "inline" was part of
the name. An 8087 is a DIP package - 40 pins or more. SO my reference was
that if you have a pin grid array package, it would be harder to unplug
and reseat.
 How'd I know you wanted help on "LAST"? In an effort to supply a more
usable system, I logged the missed help words. This was very helpful in
the early days when I was building the help file. It didn't do any good
to have someone asking for help on something logical to them but that
I hadn't thought of, so the idea struck me to go ahead and see what things
folks were asking for that wasn't there. ;-)

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/KEYBOARDS

Ward, you sure don't ask for much, do you? I'd try calling the nice folks
at Lexmark. I didn't think I liked them, at first. You will recall how
much I liked the kb that came with my CompuAdd Express machine - made by
BTC, very solid. Well, I ordered another for my home machine, and got
a Lexmark keyboard instead. It seems the Express folks switched sources
because Lexmark is trying to get into the businss bigtime (cheap). Anyway,
the feel is nice (about like an IBM, but quieter). It's rubber dome or
somesuch, with a nice feel. Well-laid out, a nice long (straight/flat)
cable, and fairly light, but with a solid feel.

The one thing it lacks is your (and my) choice of control key, and of cours
it has no switch. But Lexmark is advertising for the retail market these
days, and may have something more to your liking.

To be honest, I think that I've finally gotten used to the lower-left
control key. I have a program to switch things on my work machine, but
I seldom use it. Just like I got used to the F-keys across the top - but
then I have large hands, which may have made the switch easier.

The only thing I can't get used to is GUIs. Maybe if I had a touch-
screen they'd make sense. Right now, I'm in the process of paring
down a Windows 3.0 installation so I can run the occasional bit of
software without 5 MB of junk. OS/2 sounds pretty good, though. Have you
taken a look at 4OS/2? It's from the same folks who make 4DOS, whic
is a MUST for DOS.

I have the Intel Satisfaxion board. I have the older one with a 2400
baud modem. I just did "upgrade" it from Intel. It now has the ability
to switch "auto-magically" between FAX/modem calls.
I used to use FAXit from Alien computing.came with the board. Its a
Windows program. (I have never used the FAX under DOS, but the Intel
software claims to be able to.
With the "upgrade" I got Faxability Plus.a somewhat better package under
Windows. Has a database of fax destinations, can add cover sheets (with
artwork), keeps logs of in/outbound faxes, delayed sends, etc. Its pretty
nice. I have limited fax needs, but will admit to not being able to live
witout it now! Its nice to be able to fax directly out of any windows
app. that can print. Sometimes I am on the phone with an associate
and we are taking about a data structure for example. To be sure we
both understand the format we fax a quick sketch, while still talking.
(I'm gettin some line noise!)
L'me know what else ya wanta know.

All COMMAND.COMs are not created equal. I wrote a quick & dirty little
program that checks the 32 CRC value of command.com when run. I put this

all computer viruses attack/attach to command.com.
If your interested in the program its available on my BBS at 991-3894 or

Cont. from last msg. I lost my train of thought. in the last msg.
In my CHKCMD program I had to build in the CRC from as many different
COMMAND.COMs as I could find. Never found any two that generated the
same CRC, even ones that were the same size. If nothing else the
output of the VER command, would make every OEM version different.
