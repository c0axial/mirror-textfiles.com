 I gave the card to Randy Suess. Randy is getting rid of a bunch of
hardware, and it might include that card - you might give him a call
to see. Unfortunately, I don't know about your application - you're
looking for something more modern than the stuff I dealt with - it
was just too long ago. You want one of these "Press 1 for product
information." type things, right?

 Upstate NY? I'd forgotten!
 I'm going to a meeting tomorrow where I might commit a lot of funds,
I'll probably just keep what I've got - it is pretty new and lightly
utilized, so I should probably just keep using it instead of pressing
my nose on ElekTek's window looking @ THE DJ550C.
 Gee, just went to see what t new one would cost - the doggone ElekTek
has the DJ as "fair traded" or whatever it is that makes it NOT a catalog
item!
 Lets assume I'm just going to keep it - if something comes up soon that
makes me want to go to the new one (like a particular task better suited
to the mixed black/color environment) I'll see if you've done something
else or not.

In reguards to the application yes, according to the product description
literature, this application could be handled by several of the products
I refered to. The problem is there isn't many people out there as end
users that have used those cards, nor are there many articles on the subject
So far I've found 1. Anyhow, thanks for the information. I have school
tonight, will try and get in touch with you this weekend!
Regards!
