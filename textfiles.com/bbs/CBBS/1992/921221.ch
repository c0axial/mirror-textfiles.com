Not sure I can recall any other Model number.its the one with the ca
clam shell case.I would like to get $700 at leaset for it.

The 386 is the TurboSport with a 108 meg HD (stacker-ed to over 200 Meg)
Both have internal 2400 baud modems.I would like $975 or better for the
386.

I also have a brand new, shrink wrapped copy of Intel Faxability Plus
software I would sell for $40 (1/3 the store price)
