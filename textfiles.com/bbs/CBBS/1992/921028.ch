to ALL re: CHANGING AT&T PC63000 BATTERY?

A friend has an AT&T PC6300 (IBM-PC compatible). The clock/calendar
battery seems dead. Can anyone tell me if the battery is replaceable?
(And where it is located?) Thanks.

By the way, there is a file called ATT1991.ZIP that describes how to
correct the PC6300 so that it will accept years in the range 1992-1999
(vs. the original range of 1984-1991). If you're interested but can't
locate it, leave a message here.

to ALL re: IDIOSYNCRASY IN TANDON DOS?

If anyone has a recent Tandon PC running DOS 5.0, I would appreciate
you're running the two test programs given below. The purpose is to
determine what value is in the CX register at the start of a .COM
program. (No, it's not the program length; that's true only if you
load the .COM file under DEBUG. The normal value actually is 00FF.
I need to know if the Tandon has 0000 instead.)
 Test program one: Test program two:
 org 100h
 mov dl,ch Same as test program one,
 add dl,40 except change second line
 mov ah,2 to read "mov dl,cl"
 int 21h
 mov ah,4ch
 int 21h
Each program will print one character on the console. Please
report what each of those characters are. Thanks much.

to ROY LIPSCOMB re: R/CHANGING AT&T PC63000 BATTER

I think the battery is located in a holder on the bottom of
the machine. I had to chnage one years ago.the motherboard
is upside down, and you remove the BOTTOM cover of the case to get
to it (I think!).

Hello. I was wondering if you are the Ward C. that I knew as a child. We
We both lived in a little place named Hoopa, CA and Ward's mother (Imogene)
was a school teacher. Are you that Ward? If so, drop me a line at P.O. Box
1469, Willow Creek, CA 95573. If not, disregard this message. MO
