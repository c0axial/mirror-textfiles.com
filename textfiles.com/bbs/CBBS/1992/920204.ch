Msg 45467 is 08 line(s) on 02/03/92 from MICHAEL SHARTIAG
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/WINDOWS PROBLEM

Ward,
   Recently while updating to a new machine, I backed the entire system
to tape, then restored to the new machine.  Several windows applications
would not run.  After beating it around with several of the software
vendors they told me that their software does not 'back up & restore
properly'.  While I have no idea why, re-installing did the trick..
  Also as someone else pointed out the .ini files for windows and some
applications have their own .ini's.
No dup. chars.
