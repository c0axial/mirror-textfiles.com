to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/DESKJET

I mean it comes out faster{ I think this has to do with the
fact that the LJ has to wait until{all is in memory, and the{
get going and prin{ the page, whera3{ the DJ just spits it ou{.

InxD any event, faster output. No kidding. I'qve also written my own setup
program, using 4DOS's batch extensions. If you haven't used 4DOS,
you haven't lived! In any event, problem solved.

I love the DJ, though. I now have the Prestige Elite math cart in it,
and that works nicely, though I had to learn another wrinkle in PCL to
get everythingtto work! (point sizes! Since there's an inter{al
12 cpi font, you need to specify point size to differentiate).

This is a rather noisy line, so I think {'ll end here.
