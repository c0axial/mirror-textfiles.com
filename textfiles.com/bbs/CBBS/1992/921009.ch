]re Boardwatch: Just a wry sort of half a joke. In the B'watch
contest I had voted for the 1st bulletin board, Ward's & Randy's CBBS,
which Randy engineered and for which Ward wrote 20,000 lines of code.

01 ?  Spent most of two days at the Lap/Palm show in Chicago - Thurs & Fri.
02 ?The most interesting box I saw was from Gateway - a 2.75# sub-notebook,
03 ?with 400-line (double-scan CGA), 40M hard disk, (an ultra-thin 2.5"er)
04 ?etc.  $1295 direct.  I've got details if you're interested.

05   IBM showed off its new line of machines:  all are called "Thinkpad", which
06 ?is dumb, because that makes you think of the "pad" - i.e. pen based one.
07 ?  The 300 is a 5.9# monochrome machine, with 80 ($1375) or 120 ($1575)
08 ?hard disk, 4M ram, ethernet ($125 (ea.) adapter cable for 10baseT or
09 ?thinnet), and a REALLY NEAT "port replicator" which allows you to hang
10 ?your cables off of the back of this 1.5" thick thingie - serial, parallel,
11 ?power, VGA, mouse, keyboard - and quickly connect or disconnect all, with
12 ?a simple motion.
13 ?  The 700 comes in mono (^U

A,C,D,E,G,H,I,L,R,S,W (or ?):?c
13 ?  The 300 is a 386SL at 25mhz with 64K cache.
14 ?  The 700 line is the IBM 486SLC (a 16-bit I/O (bad) 16K cache (Good!)
15 ?chip made by IBM based upon Intel licensing) running at 25MHz, with an
16 ?upgrade available to the 25/50 chip.  An 80M machine goes for $2700, and
17 ?120M for $2950 (if I'm recalling right).  
18 ?  The 700C is a Beeeautiful 10.4 (largest in the industry, I think!) color
19 ?active matrix 486SLC.

Line was:
active matrix 486SLC.  active matrix 486SLC - goes for 4300 or so - anticipated street of $4k.

20 ?The 700C was so agressively priced (this is with 3-year on-site warranty!)
21 ?that other machines like the 300C just "fell out of the line".
22 ?  ----
23 ?  Other interesting things - there are now several vendors of GPS hardware
24 ?and software so if for example you're into sailing, you can tell exactly
25 ?where you are at any time.  Pretty slick.  (Didn't get prices).
