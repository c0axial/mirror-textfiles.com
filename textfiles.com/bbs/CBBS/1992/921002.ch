Msg 45770 is 07 line(s) on 10/01/92 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to RANDY IMAGEN re: BACKSPACE

 Another use complained that backspace didn't work. THEIR problem was that
they were using VT-100 emulation, and pressing a left-arrow, which sends,
true to VT-100 emulation, and escape, left bracket, then some alpha char.
CBBS is designed for ESC to cancel the line, just as it is in a PC, so the
left-arrow VT-100 key is seen as an ESC then some other chars.
 Please don't give up on CBBS, just pick a terminal emulation that sends
an honest-to-goodness backspace - ^H, 08 hex, etc.

Give Jerry Olsen a buzz over at the Advocate, 312-939-4411 by modem (he
often logs on here, but I think he's up against some article deadlines).
A few years back he wrote a hard-drive lockout program that might be of
use in this situation,
