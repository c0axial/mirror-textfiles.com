Dear Sysuser:
 Sure, an ad for your BBS would be welcome. Just leave out the "noise",
i.e. my preference is for no *'s, -'s, etc. Just info. ;-)

Msg 45686 is 03 line(s) on 05/27/92 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to RICHARD GOZDAL re: R/MS C

 I've got some connections, so while I didn't get the offer, I got the
SOFTWARE. Nearly got a hernia lifting the box! Even comes with 386^max,
because I understand the environment needs a memory manager!

Msg 45687 is 10 line(s) on 05/27/92 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to RICHARD HINTON re: R/MOTHER BOARD?

 That's a pretty good price. You of course WILL double your perf, but
it will make you want a faster/larger hard disk, etc. Go ahead and
check what a 486/33 would cost, too! It will be double AGAIN the
performance, and a few hundred spent now might be cheaper than spending
more next year to go 486. They really HAVE come down in price. (But you're
getting a steal - if memory is say $35/meg, that's $280 of your $530 just
for memory - leaving $250 for the motherboard. Hmm. TOO cheap. No cache?
(you're not halving the memory speed when you double the processor, so
you need something else to make it faster - my 386/sx/25 has no cache,
but has memory interleaving, which effectively is faster.)

Msg 45688 is 10 line(s) on 05/28/92 from RICHARD GOZDAL
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/MS C

 Yea, looks like 6,000 pages of manual with the MS C!
 Guess the prices is right. Something is up with MS, The Basic
PDS is down to a $99 upgrade price from QB. Must be more than
poor software sales, must be a language war.
 Guess I must have lucked out the mem manager I got with my 386
works great and one less pgm to worry about trying to handle it.
 Maybe the hidden message with this sale is IF people will pay
the $150 for "printed" manuals for the Windows docs rather than
the on line docs. That would give them a better taste of what
people will pay for Windows software.

Msg 45689 is 14 line(s) on 05/29/92 from JERRY OLSEN
to MURRAY ARNOW re: R/CHICAGO ONLINE

Chicago Online is simply a new area on America Online. According to the
COL facilitator, if you subscribe to COL, you'll get exactly what you
would get if you subscribed to AOL except that you'll have a button on
the opening screen which will jump you into the COL section if you
choose to click on it with your mouse. (Actually, I strongly suspect
that the software is 100% identical with the regular AOL and your area
code is used to determine that you should get a COL button on the
screen.) In any case, AOL and COL subscribers may jump between each
others without additional charge.
 I gathered additional info about this for a feature story I
just submitted about AOL, but perhaps the above is what you're seeking.
(BTW, later this year they plan to add a second "local AOL" too-in
Florida somewhere. The Tribune Company has their fingers in that too.

Msg 45690 is 30 line(s) on 05/29/92 from JERRY OLSEN
to ARCADY KHOTIN re: R/HELLO FROM RUSSIA

I was delighted to see your messages here.

Most of my work these days involves writing for computer magazines,
including a column about international computer issues which is
syndicated in England and Australia. Because of this I have set up and
keep in contact with about 300 sources around the world.

Through that process I of course have learned quite a bit about some of
the questions you raised in your first message here-too much for a
single message, in fact. We could continue exchanging messages here, if
you plan to continue calling; but I sometimes can't call here for weeks
at a time.

One option might be to use my BBS (in the same city as this one) at
312-939-4411 (up to 2400 bps), which I monitor several times each day.
Another possibility might be via Internet, which you mentioned. But it
will depend what local node you use to access Internet. Some nodes in the
Commonwealth countries are extremely expensive-not for you, but for us
in the States. The reason is that WE get billed for messages to you AND
from you-and all are quite expensive. So if you currently have personal
access to Internet, you might leave your Internet address here or on my
BBS. I'll respond with one message on Internet despite the costs. (I'm
sorry to be particularly concerned about this, but with the large network
of international callers I constantly maintain at my own expense, I must
be!)

I look forward to hearing from you and exchanging messages, whether here
or elsewhere. I'll respond to some of your questions and perhaps you
would be kind enough to respond to some of mine for use in my column.
 Best wishes.

Msg 45691 is 14 line(s) on 05/29/92 from JERRY OLSEN
to BILL WOLFF re: INTERNET

Just a quick addition to your comments, in case others try to use them.
 From CIS and other systems, you must remember to precede the
Internet address with a ">" redirection symbol-followed IMMEDIATELY by
"INTERNET:." (A few systems will generate the redir symbol for you
and remove extraneous spaces, but CIS doesn't.)
 Secondly, you of course correctly showed the correct address
format for messages back TO CIS (other than the ">INTERNET:" preface
which most systems require that you enter manually), but it bears
emphasis that the comma in all CIS addresses must be changed to the
period which Internet understands. (Most systems WILL do this
conversion for you <smile>.)
 On a separate note, glad to hear the IDE woes you mentioned here
and on my BBS are fixed.
 Regards.

to JERRY OLSEN re: IDE TROUBLE OVER

Thanks and never a dull moment trying something new to work with
something you already have. I guess it's just comes with the job!

Msg 45693 is 23 line(s) on 05/29/92 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/COMPUADD EXPRESS

of course i could do that, but I have no need, nor budget. More
to the point, havinf this old creature feature at home helps me
to appreciate the 386 at work. you mentioned 'memory
interleave' in another posting - what's this, and how does it
speed things up?

On another note - I can't imagine working without DR DOS 6.0!
I will never go back to
MS-DOS. The memory features are nice, the disk cache is quite good,
and the task switcher makes even bad software look good.
For example - the American Heritage Dictionary (AHED). It comes with two
versions, both TSR. One is small, but activating it just loads
up a large program from disk, so it's SLOW. Then there's a second TSR
that gets you into AHED fast, but which eats some 150+K. So whaty
do you do? With the DRDOS task switcher, you just load AHED as a
task and swap it out to extended memory. Then, when you need it, it's
easy as pie to switch tasks, the whole thing is there NOW, and it takes
no memory away from your real session. IT's cute. It also
works well for debugging - if a program locks up the machine, all it's
really locked up is the one task session, and you can terminate that
and still have a functioning system. Try it - it's
so much better than MS-DOS that there is no comparison. Of course,
with 4DOS on top, it's even better.

Msg 45694 is 09 line(s) on 05/30/92 from JOHN SERRANO
to ALL re: PD TCP/IP FOR FTP?

I'm looking for a public domain version of TCP/IP that features the
following items: SLIP and automatic dialing (to dial the terminal
server). I guess FTP is a given.

Does such a creature exist? I downloaded a package from ftp.ncsa.uiuc.
edu, but it only works with network adapters, not modems. Does anyone
know of an ftp site that has what I need?

Thanks.

I have been using the book "The Armchair Universe" by A.K. Dewdney. I a
ing to make a program that lets you zoom in on the "Mandelbrot Set" fractal
As far as his program describes it I am doing everything he says. If
anyone knows how to make the program (in basic) or has the book tell me.
I have the IBM compatible GW-Basic.

Msg 45696 is 20 line(s) on 05/30/92 from JOE SEROCKI
to ALL re: LAPTOP FOR SALE

I have a Zenith laptop for sale or trade. This is the 184 series,
8088, 640k, CGA compatible graphics, 20m hard drive and 720k floppy,
1200 baud internal modem.

It is in excellent shape, with a new hard drive and controller card,
and new battery pack.

It operates on internal batteries or 12vdc, making it an excellent packet
rig. Includes soft case, power supply, and battery pack.

I figure it's value to be about $500 or so. It would not be so much except
that all the critical parts are new.

I am looking to sell it outright (preferrably) or to trade it for an
HF rig of some sort. The rig must be 12vdc, can be a QRP rig such
as the Ten-Tec Century 22 or Heath HW9 series (with a little cash or ??
thrown in) or a low end HF rig such as the 747GX, 725, 730 or so.

If are interested in a purchase or trade, I can be reached at
708-632-8723 or at N9IFG@W9ZMR.IL.USA.NA. Thanks es 73, Joe. .-.
