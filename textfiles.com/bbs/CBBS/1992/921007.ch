to ALL re: TELNET/FTP ACCESS

Can anyone inform me of any service LOCAL to the Chicago area
which provides TELNET or FTP access to the Internet? I have
a subscription to WORLD (Software Tool and Die) as well
as EMAIL capabilities, however, I would like off-prime TELNET if
possible. Thanks in advance,
