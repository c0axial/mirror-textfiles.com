to ALL re: DATA ON FM SUBCARRIER?

 I thought I once heard something about data being broadcast on those
SCA thingies (Sub Carier Authority) - like how Muzak gets broadcast?
Anyone have any details?
 P.S. CBBS co-founder Randy Suess just got a satellite hookup for
the news feed for his Unix system!

to ALL re: PARTICIPATE!

 C'mon, folks, good old historical CBBS is back up - but we need some
message traffic to keep things going. What's pulling your chain these
days - palmtops? Deskjet 550C (The new one with simultaneous mounting
of the black & the C/Y/M cartridge, vs the 500C which "made up black"
by mixing C/Y/M). How about laptops? What do people have/do? I'm happy
with my Toshiba T1000XE - old technology - only a 10MHz 80C86, but it
does find with Kedit, Grandview, Quattro Pro, FoxBase, etc.
 Anyone else interested in those 20M floptical disks? They're magnetic,
but use an optical servo for precise positioning. I think you can get
a drive for as little as $299, but the media is about $1/M ($20 ea). Tape
is obviously much cheaper, BUT it is of course not quickly random access!

to HARVEY NICE re: THANKS!

Thanks for the kind words on CBBS being back up again. What are you
up to these days, computer hobby wise? What new modem 'ya checkin out?
(I see it was 1200 baud.).
 In case anyone didn't realize, CBBS is running a gift (from USR) HST,
which COULD have been a dual standard, except for their screwey policy
of not allowing credit cards or credit- when it was in for minor service,
they required a MONEY ORDER or CASHIER'S CHECK to have it upgraded to
the dual standard! So I said "screw it, just fix it and send it back".

to ALL re: CD ROMS

I'm interested in installing a CD ROM. I'd appreciate some input on
manufacturers, performance, and standards. Since my knowledge is very
primitive all comments are useful.

to DANIEL EVANS re: CHINET GUESTS

 Guests on Chinet may *read* news only on weekends but not send
at any time. For complete information do "news -a" after logging
in on Chinet's guest lines, 312-283-0559. All the information is
on Chinet which now gets its feed via satellite and a little dish
on the roof.

to ALL re: LIMITING SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS

This month's Scientific America carries an article about limiting
software applications in some situations because of the
possiblity of bugs. The mathematical proof of the impossible
situation of eliminating all bugs other than by trial and
error was proved earlier this century by Godel. I hope this is
of interest to some.

PKZIP. The fast algorithm is known but not the slow algorithm.
