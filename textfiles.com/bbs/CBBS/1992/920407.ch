  I use Norton SI 6.0.  I get 17.4 on my 386/25 SX.  I get 74 on my 486/33.
At times my 386 gets 12!  Dunno why!  I can consistently get specific
results: boot DOS 5, NO DRIVERS, I get 12.sometihng.  Boot DOS 3.3, I get
17.4!  At first I thought it was Brooklyn Bridge drivers - continually
interrupting to try to "find" the non-attached slave machine, but now,
I get "inconsistent" results.  I just shelled out to SI in the middle
of this line, I got 17.4 again.  Hmmm.

I friend of mine writes the follow of which I have no idea how to
help. I reprinted this part so other here may be able to read and
come up with some ideas. Here goes...

=====================================================================

You mentioned IMP and MEX. Do you still have them? I might ask you
for copies if your so inclined, to help the war effort so to speak. A
lot of the MARS members have been issued Zenith Z-120's and I've been
trying to help with their problems, even though I know nothing about
them. I am almost sure they won't run any PCDOS programs and a very
small smattering of MSDOS programs unless written or ported to ZDOS,
it's OS.. I just was told that the Z100/120 will run CP/M if you have
the boot disk for that OS, and then use either IMP or MEX as a
terminal program. Many members want to dedicate the machine to packet
only but haven't been able to find a terminal program that will run
with ZDOS. Maybe CP/M, in this case, is the answer. Would also need a
way to format the fixed drive, 10 meg in the machines, to CP/M, and
then they would be in business...

No dup. chars.
