to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/MEMORY INTERLEAVE

 I really have no idea what machines have interleave, outside of the
IBM world. The new model "L" machines in the 90-95 line have memory
interleave, and no cache. By alternating banks, the memory appears to
be 2x as fast as going all to the same bank, I think.
 As to wait states, I dunno. With a 286, it was pretty obvious, because
there was no cacheing. Since the processor fetches memory typically
about every 4th clock cycle, 1 wait state was about 25% slower than 0.
 But with cacheing, you have "effectively, 0 wait states" some percentage
of the time, based upon cache hits.
 I guess I don't completely understand it myself.
