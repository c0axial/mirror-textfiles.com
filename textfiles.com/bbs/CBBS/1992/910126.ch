  Some (most?) plotter foils have a coating that is water soluble - if
that's what HP's do, then they'll work in the DJ also.  IBM Plotter foils
work fine - tried one - but bought a box of the HP ones.
  P.S. "foils" seems to be an IBM-eze word, dunno if it is the "common"
term for it.

to WARD re: DJ500

I think you mentioned that you bought a DJ500C.  Do you still have
your prior machine, and would you be interested in selling it?  I'm
looking for a DJ500.

Msg 45427 is 10 line(s) on 01/24/92 from GAVIN PETERS
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: PROBLEMS!

Ok, Ward.  I just read through the original documentation for XMODEM-82,
and I've found that it is incorrect.  It states that ACK is 05h, when in
fact it is 06h.  That problem had me wondering for a very long time.

Anyways, other then that everything is copasetic.  I've been able to write
an XMODEM reciever that actually is pretty fast...  I just reduced the
timeout for the PURGE at the end ofthe block, and it went a lot
faster...  :-)  Maybe undocumented, but it works.

Anyways, Ward.  I'm calling from Canada, so I can't stay on long.  Ciao!

to ANDY SHAPIRO re: DOS EDITORS!

I don't know Andy... I've got so spoiled by full screen DOS editors
that MS-DOS, CP/M, or whatever just doesn't cut the mustard anymore.
No dup. chars.
