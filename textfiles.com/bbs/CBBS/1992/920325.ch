to ALL re: AID FOR VISUALLY HANDICAPPED

A friend of mine who is visually handicapped has heard of an add-on to
wordperfect called, I believe, "big for wordperfect".  It evidently makes
all characters, commands etc., appear in a very large font for the
wordperfect program.  It is supposed to be shareware, I believe and he was
told that it was "available from most bulletin boards".  I'm trying to help
him find where he can get this program/utility.  So far I've been un
unsuccessful.  Has anyone heard of this program/know where I can download
it from?

I read another bulletin a while back regarding the same subject, however, I
have never seen the product myself. I will be going to COD comuter fair
next month and will take a look in the shareware programs. I'll also
dig out my shareware programs catalogs and look there for you! Will
drop you a line if I find anything....
Another thought... Call the lighthouse for the blind, they also handle
the visually impared. Maybe they have heard of such a product...
Good Luck

Thanks very much for your reply Al.

It's from Hexagon Products in Park Ridge.  They're at PO Box 1295, Park
Ridge, IL  60068.  Probably the easiest thing to do is get the registered
version straight from them ($39).  They also have Big for 1-2-3, B-Edit
(large print text editor) and B-Pop ("review-mode" enlarger that will
enlarge any display and let you pan around, but freezes application while
popped up).  According to their literature, the evaluation versions are
available from Compu$erve as well as some shareware disk vendors.  There's
a BBS in Pittsburgh (BlinkLink, 412-766-0732) that probably has them, and
when I get the COPH-2 BBS back up, I'll try to put them there.

Yup.  Fuzz yer eyes.  I've never had any need for color (I tend
to think it's a distraction in most cases), and the LAST thing I need
is a fuzzy screen to go with it.  What's the best dot pitch
you've seen?  I think I saw 0.25 on one machine.  But given
the price of much of this stuff, I don't feel justified in complaining/.
I mean, remember when a 10MByte disk would set you back $800 or so --
controller not included?

ON a more related side note -- what's the difference betwixt VGA and
'super' VGA?  I have this sneaking suspicion from what I've
read that 'super' is really 'infra,' but I dunno.
