 Ya, funky. Ann Pelz is a 15 year old guy named Brandon Ellison. I
don't think he catches on. Promised not to use Ann's name again ;-)

to ALL re: HEATHKIT DEAD?

 Just heard that Heathkit is now gone! Bummer! Not that I've used 'em
much since the mid 70s, but still too bad.
 I once read something that to make a kit, they had to charge quite a bit
more than if they sold it built - to cover the engineering of the kit
building, warranty returns, etc.

Msg 45661 is 03 line(s) on 05/16/92 from BILL WOLFF
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/HEATHKIT DEAD?

Heathkit isn't gone yet. in fact order the catalog as a collectors
item. Yea. I got mine right next to me matter of fact. They even
sell Windows for DOS, can you believe it?

 Folks who desire a listing of area bulletin boards are advised to
call Stillwaters BBS (708-403-2826) and get a copy of their listing.
 It covers all of 312 and 708 area codes, as well as some 815 and
219 systems.
 Stillwaters lets you download the listing even if you aren't a
subscriber to their system.
 Those of you who have Internet/Usenet access can obtain the list
by reading the alt.bbs.lists newsgroup. The list usually gets posted
there around the end of the first week of the month.
