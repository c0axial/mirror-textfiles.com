Hi!
I'm calling via PCP from St.Petersburg, Russia! My name is Arcady Khotin.
I read a lot about this great board and now am very exited to be able
to use it. Is it true that Ward Christensen is still running it?
The telecommunications era just started in my country about a year and
Door
and now have access to Internet and even Sprint. Telephone lines are noisy,
telefaxes are still a novelty and the to access international line one
has to book a call , and it often takes three days to make it. The solution -
telecommunications via modems. Networks are growing like mashrooms. And
new disappointment - as it turned out, in your country not all businesses are
using E-Mail at all. So, to reach you we still have to rely on phone and fax.
 I need your advice, colleagues - what should we do to find out if this and
that company has access to E-Mail without calling or faxing them? Do you
have some directories of E-Mail addresses accessible from Internet or some
commercial nets like CompuServe? Or books or catalogues?
As an example I'll tell you true story happened a few days ago: we had
problems with streamer made by Irwine Magnetics. They have 800 number and I
asked one of my US friends to give them a call and ask about my problem.
He did called, but couldn't solve it. So I asked him to ask them about if
they have E-Mail - and it turned out that they haven't! So here am I with
my unsolved problem and without access to the guys to ask. And there are
lots of similar cases.
To make it short - please advice, what should I do to find E-Mail address of
a company, if I can't call'em up and ask.
Best regards to clleagues!
Hope to hear your answers.
Arcady
