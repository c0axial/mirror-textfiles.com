to ROD GOODWIN re: FINE ARTS BBS

  What kind of things are you going to cover?  Plays?  Reviews?  A friend
who goes to a lot of plays has long wished for a BBS covering "cultural"
topics ;-)

Msg 45574 is 05 line(s) on 04/05/92 from BILL MATTSON
to ALL re: POWERMETER PROGRAM

Has any body come across a program called "POWERMETER" or something
similar to that? It might have come from PC_Magazine as a utility or
benchmark prog. What other benchmarks or speed test programs have you
used? I would like to hear about hardware and results, including the
Norton SI (please indicate the revision/version).
