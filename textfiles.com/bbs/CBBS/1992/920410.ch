Msg 45577 is 08 line(s) on 04/06/92 from BILL MATTSON
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/POWERMETER PROGRAM

I get about 51 on the SI, with a 486/33 with 64K external cache. But I
understand SI may not recognise cache outside of the chip. Also, the
SI I'm using is old, perhaps 286 vintage, and maybe not 486 "smart".
I suspect the result ought to be higher than I'm seeing. The Whetston,
Drhyston, and Landmark tests are outstanding. I see increases ranging
from 25% to 400+% for various tests compared to my 386/33+387 system.
I was curious about your results. Have you run any benchmarks?
P.S. My 386/33 yields 40 on the same SI, and that's 25% anyway. Bye...
