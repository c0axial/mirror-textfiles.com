 Ya, IBM & Toshiba were the only 2 supported - but there are rumors
of being able to patch others in - you patch in the name of the drive
in the driver so when the drive ID's itself the driver sez "OK". I
hadn't heard of the zip file you're referring to. Still quite up in the
air as to what direction to go.
 I don't know what the deal was on the developers CD-rom. I think the
guy who said he was getting me one didn't, for I've seen him several times
and he never mentioned it (and I didn't think of it).
 The only beta test I know of is for C+, but don't know if it is external
or not. There is something like a "developer's Assistance Program" (DAP)
but not sure how you'd enroll in it. I think the general IBM 800 # is
1-800-IBM-3333, they might know.

Yes, I have a Gateway. You're right about their offer for customers only.
