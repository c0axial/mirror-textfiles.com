01 ?  Anyone have experience with these drives?  Specifically, I went from
02 ?a 120 to a 250, and I'm getting way too many errors on the 250M tapes- 
03 ?on the order of 300, to as many as 1400.  I just bought a new 3M 2120
04 ?tape, and will format it to see how it does.
05 ?  Thanks for any ideas.

Msg 45707 is 09 line(s) on 06/07/92 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to BILL MATTSON re: R/32-BIT C COMPILERS

 I demonstrated the IBM C-set/2 Workframe at the PS/2-OS/2 forum a few
weeks ago - looks like a pretty respectable product. The thing is only
$295 from 1-800-3-IBMOS2 (soft-copy documentation only). The many sample
programs included in the toolkit are valuable - how to do multi-threading,
how to integrate 16-bit and 32-bit applications (speaking if which, the
internal call to call from 32-bit to 16-bit is called "THUNK").
 I don't know of any others. I've heard of only one problem with the
C-set, which had a disappointing "working as designed" answer instead of
a fix.

 Sorry to hear you're looking! Is USR suffering from the general
worsening of the economy? (My office is working to get down 22% by
the end of the year!)

Msg 45709 is 07 line(s) on 06/07/92 from ROBERT FULTON
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/SITUATION WANTED

Ward,
No, USR is doing well, but a management reorganization has left me
redundant. There seems to be a management reverse corollary to the Not
Invented Here syndrome, which says that training in a company is not
applicable when the company reaches a different status.
I still really like USR, and would recommend anyone to work there, it's
just not a great place for me any more.

 Anyone have any comments as to how the HP PaintJet XL300 with
Postscript performs, on reliability, and $ value is. The images that
are printed are they better than the PCL5C mode?

Msg 45711 is 08 line(s) on 09/12/92 from NORB DEMBINSKI
to ALL re: MUSTANG II PS BOARD

 Anyone used the Mustang II postscript board for the HP LJ III
printer? The board has 4Meg of memory and allows postscript file output
to be printed by the HP LJ III. The board also allows another PC to be
connected to the printer using the existing parallel port. The board
is able to switch from PCL5C and postscript automatically. Any and
all comments are welcome.

 Anyone have any comments as to the Telebit QBlazer modem? Mainly
as to how the modem performs, reliability, and value. Telebit has a
direct marketing program on and is asking $299.00 for the . The
modem is V.32 compliant, etc.

to ALL re: CBBS BACK UP

Thanks to Randy being willing to support the "old beast", CBBS is back
up. Norb Dembinski even beat me in on the first call - minutes after
CBBS went on the phone line!
 Please pass the word about CBBS(*). I know, it is old, but it like a ride
thru history, and I AM working on re-writing it in a way that can still
be compatible with the "old interface" - perhaps message threading is
the most important.
 (*) meaning, I'd appreciate it if you sent a note to your favorite
BBS saying something like "CBBS/Chicago, the worlds first, is back online
after an outage since June. If you want to see a bit of history, call
(312) 545-8086. HST to 9600. Operator Ward Christensen"
 (or something like that).
 Thanks! AND, please call CBBS - lets see if a bit of history can still
live in this day and age.

Msg 45715 is 04 line(s) on 09/12/92 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to NORB DEMBINSKI re: R/TELEBIT QBLAZER MODEM

 Telebit is known for their Unix involvement, and specifically have
modems that are good for UUCP - the unix-unix protocol. The QBlaser
doesn't have "PEP" that's needed for that.
 I asked Randy Suess about it, that was all he knew.
