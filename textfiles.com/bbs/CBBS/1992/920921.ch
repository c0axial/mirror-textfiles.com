Geez, I thought an era had passed...
I used to check into CBBS regularly bunches of years ago...
when I tried dialing in a while back and got nothing, I was sad...
I'm not familiar witinet... I know what it is, that's about all...
glad to see the old board breathing.
I expect to be around to see what's happening, maybe even contribute
once or twice.
Take care!

Who are you using now for maint that you're not happy with?
TRW & GE are two names I've heard, but I have no experience.

Msg 45736 is 07 line(s) on 09/19/92 from ALEX ZELL
to WARD re: RING/PWORD

Nah, no problem.  I let Randy know right away when it happened and
he fixed it.  Hasn't occurred again since.  As for p-word, I should
have recalled it since it is based on something important to me.
I think chaz has not been calling here recently, and I know he
no longer calls chinet.  I know where he hangs out and will let him
know thru email that we are back up.  Message threads?  Betcha they
will be developed by the callers "as the spirit moves them." Fer sure.

It's good to see CBBS back up.  I've been following it's progress on Chinet
and was afraid that it wasn't going to be resurrected any time soon.
Welcome back!
