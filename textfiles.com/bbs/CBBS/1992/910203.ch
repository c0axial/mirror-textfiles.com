to ALL re: WINDOWS PROBLEM

  Installed a new drive, moved some files around to new disks, my Windows
seems fubar!
  Often while running - Corel Draw, PageMaker, etc, I get a screwy error
message "cannot complete the current operation due to error creating
remp file".  I have "set temp=d:\temp", and there is a d:\temp, and I have
17M in that directory.  For safety/compatability with older programs,
I have a "set tmp=..." the same.
  My next step will be to re-install windows from scratch, but I don't
really want to!

Ben, thanks.  My setup program does have 1.44 as a option.

Checking the obvious first . . . if the "new drive" was added to
existing drives, might you have an outdated LASTDRIVE value? Barring
that, you might explore yoiur .INI files to see if anything obvious in
there needs to be updated too.

Full screen DOS editor works just like a word processor. You can
cursor around any where and even delete forward or back or
even the whole screen. Just cursor to the line you want and press
the ENTER or RETURN key and that's it. Some even have more than
one screen or even uses windows in the screens. MS-DOS has really
slowed OS development by 20 years or more.
