to ANDY SHAPIRO re: MEMORY INTERLEAVE

 Memory interleave means having at least 2 SIMMS, (or circuitry to
address different banks of chips) in such a way, that a given "bank" is
accessed every OTHER memory cycle. In other words, you can access a byte
from the "left" bank, and while it is "recovering" to allow another
access, you access a byte from the "right" bank.
 Oh, instead of "byte" above, I should be saying "chunk" - typically
32 bits.
 It is an alternative to cache, to allow effectively 0-wait-state access.

 Gee, do you have a VGA? You ought to get Fractint. It is an incredibly
fast fractal program, available on most of the boards. Actually it will
run on a CGA even (I've used it on an XT-compatible laptop, years ago)
and the features are just outstanding. The speed makes it practical to
do a lot with it.

I don't have VGA, my computer isn't very good and Fractint pobably wouldn't
work. I am getting a new computer though with VGA, but now I pretty much
want to do it myself. Thanks.
