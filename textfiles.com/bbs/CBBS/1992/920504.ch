A friend of mine appears to have taken on a task bigger than he can
chew. He is helping another friend take a Zenith Z-120 and trying to
use it as a BBS on packet radio for a MARS station. It appears this
Zenith won't run PCDOS and nothing is available for BBS work in
ZDOS. So CP/M seems to be the only hope right now. Zenith mentions
CP/M v2.2.101 for running CP/M. Anybody out there that can help,
please EMAIL me some information to pass on to him. And thanks!

Is there a way to use copyiipc to backup a 3 1/2" disk onto a 5 1/4" disk?
I've had no success after 6 hours of popping disks. The 3 1/2 inch drive
is formatted at 1.44 mb, even though the disk itself is only 720.
the 5 1/4 disk drive is formatted at 1.2. Any ideas?

Why use copyiipc? Just use the BACKUP command from DOS if all you want
to do is really backup the files? Or better yet, just ZIP them into
one neat little file and then save the new file to disk. If you really
want to make a running copy of some protected software. then good
luck!

 I think you can XCOPY with the /s option to include subdirectories -
to copy between different sized media. Then, if you need a volume label,
you can use the DOS Label command to put in the label.
 If the diskettes are copy protected, you're probably out of luck.

I have not seen dip memory in the 4 meg chip, but they are readily available
as 4 meg simm memory modules.
