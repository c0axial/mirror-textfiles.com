  Yep, time for us to hit BangKok.  Not a good time with Comdex coming
up, but perhaps some time late April or so.
  <K this please>

  Uh, sorry 'bout that.  I added it as a real "kluge", and it documents
itself with the hideously inconsistent syntax: full?
  Were you talking to Dennis Duffner?  He, too, in the last few days,
tried to get help on FULL.
  Actually, I'm "chicken" to update the help file - I'm not sure I have
my old help-file-indexing-program around any more.  I have a file of
help keywords-only, so what you type gets looked up there, and it gives
the file offset of the actual text, so I do a direct seek.  Makes help
pretty fast.  (Ah, the tricks that used to be done to make CP/M floppies
fast ;-)

  I know what you mean - single board computers can be a BLAST!  One of
the more fun projects I did was to (1) write a 3-of-9 bar code printing
program, then (2) write a tiny assembler program to read the bar codes,
using software timing (it was speed-independent to a ratio of about
30:1) and burn it into a PROM on a $100 single board 8085 computer called
"the General".  The 8085 had a software uart built in, and you could hook
it to a serial port and send bar codes read in via the port.  Pretty
slick.  I think the ratio "function to code size" means that some small
programs are a real gas.  My "record" still stands: a 2-byte program in
the early Altair that would (1) clear memory and (2) put a machine size
indicator in the front panel lights (grin).
No dup. chars.
