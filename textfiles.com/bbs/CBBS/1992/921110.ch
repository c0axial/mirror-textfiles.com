to ANDY SHAPIRO re: R/DESKJET EXPERIENCES

 Yep, you can refill a Deskjet cartridge with a syringe and fountain-pen
ink. There are even "kits" for the less-ambitious.
 There are 2 kinds of cartridges - regular (original recipe) and high-
capacity. The original are easier to refill because the interior is just
a sponge saturated with ink. The high-capacity ones have some other kind
of bladder that pushes the ink out, and the hole in the top of the cart,
unlike the original cartridge, does NOT go into the ink reservoir!
 The printer isn't PERFECT - you won't QUITE get as good a graphics as
from a laser - just a teeny bit of banding perhaps, but compared to any
dot matrix printer - well, it blows 'em away.
 Perhaps I should sell you my old DJ500C (color!) printer and buy myself
one of the new $800 ones that has both black AND tri-color at the same
time (Vs the 500C that can take them, but only one at a time). I Kind of
did that with my older deskjet - gave it (a Plus) to my brother, when I
bought the 500c.

 How is your experience with Line Noise? Michael Shartiag is having a
lot, can't really communicate. If you are having problems, please indicate
from where you are calling. I call MNP so don't see it, but my echoes back
are pretty quick - while if MNP were correcting it would slow down. I
can NOT go 9600 baud (well, I don't have an HST - had to donate it to CBBS)
but when I did, I couldn't communicate with CBBS, had to go 2400.

to ALL re: INTERGATED VOICE

Does anyone out ther have any experience with PC add-in cards that will
provide Voice Mail??? I have found several products recently, however,
I have found verry little discussion in the trade mag. discussing the
topic. The vendors I've found are:
Prometheus - The Home Office. $299 or 539
The Complete PC - The Complete Ans. Machine $399
Natural MicroSystems - Watson - $249
Talking Technology- Big Mouth $ 295
 Most of these cards provide the basic answering machine tasks, have a
built in modem and some can do FAX sending. What I'm looking for is
a board that will allow me to provide a general greeting, followed by
an option message, based upon the message, the customer will be able
to input a selection (1-4) for a more detailed msg. I have the MFG
technical data sheets on all the products, however they all clame to
perform just about the same features. (Except Big Mouth it can perform
outbound telemarketing).
Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated bucause i'm at the point
I need to make a decision and purchase one of them. If anyone would
be intrested in the results once I've purchased one, I'd be more than
happy to share the experience with them.
