the cover of November Boardwatch magazine.  Mebbe he felt it was

 What Again? (just kidding). Is it as goofy as last time? Or is this
the one with Dvorak handing me the award while I look off in space? (There
was camera trouble, I wasn't ready.)

I'm happy to learn that you were able to get something out of the discussion
I think you will have trouble in purchasing the books mentioned. They have
been out of print for some time. There is a chance that you may find them
in a used book store ( avery slim chance). If you should be fortunate
enough to find them, you may be shocked reading their prices. Good luck.
