 Sorry, i've not heard of a disk defragging program for OS/2 yet - but if
OS/2 takes off, you can expect 'em from Norton, et al. That's not a good
answer. Right now, (shudder) backing up and restoring might be the
only one - OR, dual-booting to DOS and defragging there. Hmm, probably
a good idea to first see if the extended attribute pointers are preserved
across a defrag! (I know I've defragged since installing OS/2, but wonder
if I then deleted it to go to the real release. Hmmm)
 P.S. just for readability, could you indent new paragraphs a couple
chars? Thanks!
 P.P.S. what is the application? Could you pre-allocate a data area,
or something like that? Then use random-I/O?

 Aha, sorry, didn't realize you weren't "local".
 Have you heard reports on the Canon drive? Sounds kind of neat, and
sure would be ideal for a small-as-feasible system. Actually, lately
I've found less and less need for 5.25 - 3.5"ers are both my "A" drives.

 THere might have been a day when IBM tried to hide something - but no,
the requirement for OS/2 at 8M (4 minimum) and 30M + 10M for swap, is
pretty well known. "RAM is Cheap" is a common phrase these days - but
even if only $40/meg, it only applies to people with new enough machines
that take 1M or 4M simms (or even 8M).

Msg 45613 is 02 line(s) on 04/21/92 from BILL WOLFF
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/OS2

Well let's see. RAM goes for $40 a meg. HD goes for $10 a meg.
and floppies goes for $.50 a meg! Hmm!

Msg 45614 is 02 line(s) on 04/22/92 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to BILL WOLFF re: R/OS2

Er, hard disk space isn't quite THAT expensive. More like $3-$4 per meg,
unless you're talking about small (under 40meg) drives.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/COMPUADD EXPRESS

Well, the Canon drive sounds good - I'll have to see how it works
when it gets here. Also, thhe machine ships with DRDOS,
which should be fun; reports I've seen make it look real good, and
when I combine it with 4DOS.heh heh heh. Just like ZCPR!
 The reason I decided to take on a 5.25" drive has to do with the
significant number of CP/M disks I still have on hand. I can read
them using a shareware package, but ninot unless I have
5.25" capability.
 Actually, one of the remarkable things about this critter is just
how small it IS - it's about 4" high, and has two open drive bays:
one is for a 3" drive, the other (forw the cannon) is 5.25".
My guess is that the machine has about 4-5" of width beyond that.
Now THAT is a small footprint. My plan is to move (eventually) to
all 3" disks, then trade the cannon for a 3.5" drive and put a
CD-ROM reader in the open slot. I figure that and a scanner (OCR)
and I'm fully in business.
