to MURRAY ARNOW re: R/CD ROMS

 This isn't going to be all that practical an answer, but I'll mention
a few things:
 1. you might want to consider whether you want to use a SCSI adapter for
other things, too - such as hard drive, or whether a dedicated CD-only
adapter will do the job;
 2. Consider whether audio is necessary; whether you need internal or
external; whether it needs to work under OS/2; whether you're going to
use it with multi-media applications (may require a relatively fast drive)
or just with "software".
 A few things to think about, anyway.

Msg 45808 is 11 line(s) on 10/17/92 from CYRUS PATEL
to ALL re: TAPE BACKUP

I'm looking for an external tape backup for my PC's (8088 through 80486's)
and I was looking at the CMS (Colorado Memory Systems) Jumbo Trakker (sp?)
250 meg tape backup unit. That's the one that connects through the
parallel port on the PC, and was wondering if anyone has any experience
with one. I also understand that Irwin makes one (I believe that
Elek-Tec sells it).

I am looking at the externals with the parallel port connection, cuz,
I don't want to have to buy extra boards or hook it up to the
floppy/hard drive cable. Are there any other's available out there?
Any info would be appreciated.

Msg 45809 is 24 line(s) on 10/18/92 from ANDY SHAPIRO
to ALL re: PRINTER SHARING

OK, Ward, here's some traffice for you:

I work in a small academic department, out here in the Eastern Wastelands.
Recently, a new department member was moved to a tenure track position,
and, as part of the package, was given a nice new PC (his pick - he got
a 33MHz 386DX). Everyone else in the office cheered, because they figgered
this meant that Mr. X would no longer hog the Zenith 386sx that's driving
the local HP LaserJet III. But nooooooooooooo. He put an ancient 8086
in his office, moved the PC to HOME, and now sits on the Zenith as before,
because it's more convenient (his term).

SO. I need to come up with a CHEAP way to share that printer out. He
hardly ever prints on it, so it won't bother him, but there are six of
us who need access fairly regularly (seven, if we count the Zenith).
The printer is no more than 50' away from any of the PCs in question.

What's the best CHEAP way to do this? Speed is a little bit of a
question, but printer buffers are cheap, and they could sit in between
the sharing unit and the PCs without much trouble. The main thing is to
make this CHEAP (again) and TRANSPARENT (ideally, no software should be
involved - just a box hanging off the parallel port.

SO - short of doing in Mr. X, what's the best way to deal with this
problem? (The department has ruled out doing him in as too expensive).

Msg 45810 is 01 line(s) on 10/18/92 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to WARD re: SPEED

9600 is working fine for me here.

Msg 45811 is 10 line(s) on 10/18/92 from ERIC BOHLMAN
to ANDY SHAPIRO re: PRINTER SHARING

How about an A/B switch box (manual) at the printer, and a cable booster
on Mr. X's machine if it's more than 15 feet or so from the printer. Ideally,
locate the switch box at the printer, not at Mr. X's desk.

If you go to an auto-switching unit, you may have some hassles you haven't
anticipated, like either having different people's outputs interleaved,
or else long timeouts to prevent that. You don't want hassles like A
downloading some soft fonts, printing a document, B then downloading his
soft fonts and printing, then A coming back and printing on the assumption
that his soft fonts are still there.

Msg 45812 is 06 line(s) on 10/18/92 from MURRAY ARNOW
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/CD ROMS

The major reason for my interest in CD ROMs is that it appears that they
are going to become a mode (maybe dominant) of software distribution.
Borland is now offering their software on CD ROM. My concern for the
moment is what will become the standard format. Can CD players read
different formats through software changes, or will the formats be
integrated into the hardware?

Msg 45813 is 05 line(s) on 10/18/92 from BILL MATTSON
to ALL re: OS2 BETA TESTERS

Any OS2 32-Bit Graphics Engine beta testers out there? I'm one. Are you
one, too? If you are.'fess up, and we can trade lies and share the
thrills of reformatting large disk volumes for the sake of the jolly
blue giant, and personal curiosity, too, of course. Or, if you're not,
I'll still talk (sic) to you, anyhow.

Msg 45814 is 06 line(s) on 10/19/92 from DENNIS STAHL
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/DATA ON FM SUBCARRIER?

Data was (is ?) available on some FM subcarriers. About two years ago
financial market information was transmitted to handheld units. The cost
of the service was in the 200 to 1000 dollar/month range. I believe Lotus
even sold a "board" for the PC bus to receive the data and software to
get it into the spreadsheet. Believe it even ran in background.
. about all I recall.

]Thank you for getting the board up.  You are apparently using amulti-
tasking operating system judging from the response.  Sometimes
the text scolls too fast for it to be stopped.  It would be nice if
the board could be put into a mode to send a screenfull of text at
a time with the opportunity to flag messages when listing messages.
Thank you for providing this service for so long.
