  Well, I found about one thing - I have NO details - but it is apparently
an 8.5 x 4 x 2 portable, one pound, 20M hard disk.  Uses one of the new
one-chip 386's.  I have no further details.  One guy at work heard they were
soon going into beta test, and he was hoping to be lucky enough to be choosen.

  My b.i.l. has one, and I told him he could re-ink the carts, and how
(oops - now/how) he's hot to do so, and I canna tell him zip.
No dup. chars.
