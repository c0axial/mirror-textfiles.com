]Thanks for the program. I am using it right now except that I customized
it a bit. I added a cursor and a printing option. I made a cursor by
making line 50 read :
50 PRINT #1,X$;"_";CHR$(29);
I made it print by using a flag to send it to a seperate subroutine
that used an LPRINT to print the info when I press ctrl-P and stops
when I press ctrl-O. I am working on a capture option. I prefer it
to the comm. program that was supplied in Deskmate for my computer.
I can load it up in 3 seconds and Deskmate takes at least a minute.
The only problem is though is that it makes an annoying buzz whenever
I press return. Why is that?

  I didn't put a cursor in, because I wanted a very short simple program
to use for a few seconds to confirm if a phone line & modem worked,
I would never dream of using it for anything serious.
  The "noise" you hear when you press enter is the prompting "bell" from
CBBS.  I'd nearly forgotten about it.  Probably silly that it is turned
on by default.
  The P command in CBBS turns it off, and if you then use the U command,
it updates your (U)ser record, so it remembers you don't want a prompting
bell from then on - once you log on and your name is entered, it will
restore the state of about 5 flags, including the prompt bell, from your
profile (not bad for software that hasn't been updated in 10 years, eh? ;-)
  My communications program has a "nobell" option, so it doesn't even beep
the first time - but I DO leave the beep off when in auto-dial mode, so
that the beep will call me to the system when it gets thru to CBBS.
  P.S. thanks for the tip on the cursor.  I'd done it before (I think I
used a block char like chr(177) or something, but I think at the time I
was as yet unaware of the "cursor addressing" of BASIC.  Then one day
a few years ago, I decided to try ALL the control chars and see what
they do ^ goes up, _ goes down, ] left (as you used), \ right, L clears,
K homes, B goes back a word, F goes forward a word, etc.   I found 'em
by experimentation.  How'd you find that chr$(29) goes back?

  Why use foam in the first place for a cartridge?  Well, probably more
spill-proof, more even pressure (gravity)...I've been not totally thrilled
with the bladder-type cartridges in the DeskJet.  It seems hard to maintain
proper pressure when a bladder might tend to suck the ink back, etc.
  Dunno if it is re-inkable - depends upon how the ink is inserted.  Foam
is inherently re-inkable because it can have ink shot into it - with a
bladder - well, what the Think Jet did was have a place on the nose of the
cartridge that was a hole - smaller than a BB - that they put the ink into,
then stuck a plastic BB into the hole to seal it.  Dunno how the DJ does it.
YOU TELL ME - take one apart after it empties (grin).
  As to the labels, they came from the - as I'm sure you know - Seiko.
I hear that now or in the near future, the post office will be able to
scann off a postalnet bar code even if it sin't on the bottom 1/4" of the
envelope, so an envelope with postalnet on the label should go faster than
one without.
No dup. chars.
