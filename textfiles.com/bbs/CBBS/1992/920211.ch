I have an original DJ (not a 500). Its docs (and comments by several
other users) is that you NOT use laser paper. (Something more porous
is preferable.) Regards.

to ALL re: QB TOOLS 4 TRADE

  Crescent Quick Pak Pro V3.1 for trade. Can be used with QB and QBX
not the latest new version. I upgraded ProBas with about 900+ routines
for QB and QBX and don't need Quick Pak now. Registered version.
  Trade for a GOOD table radio.
  (312) 775-2593 early evenings.
