to BOB LUND re: MESSAGE RETENTION

 The other msg saying to r;1 was wrong - a summary command is how you'd
find the oldest msg: When I did it tonight (o;100) I got this:
45169 10/15/91 WARD CHRISTENSEN => ALL: "THANKS TO RANDY SUESS"
 SO messages stay around here how ever long it takes to keep the # of
msgs pruned down to the high 300s. Right now it is for example, about
6 months.

Msg 45635 is 04 line(s) on 04/30/92 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALEX ZELL re: R/COPH

 IBM operates a clearing house of software and hardware ideas to help
the handicapped - I don't have the # handy, but 1-800-IBM-2468 (the "main
IBM number") should help - ask for the "NSCPD" - I think it is "National
Solution Center for the Physically Disabled".

Msg 45636 is 04 line(s) on 04/30/92 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to TONY ANTONUCCI re: R/OS/2 ON D:

 The good news is: you can have OS/2 even BOOT from D:
 The bad news is that you can only do so if you go under BOOT MANAGER,
which requires you to completely re-partition your hard disk - the boot
manager becomes a small partition, then you could have C: and D:, etc.
