For what it's worth, a client of mine has been leaving one of their machines
on overnight for over 4 years now, and nothing bad has happened to it. You
can mention that to your client (might want to tell him it would be a good
idea to turn off the monitor to prevent phosphor burn, both because it is
a good idea and because you're subtly pointing out that one of his concerns
was valid (and coming up with a workaround for it).
