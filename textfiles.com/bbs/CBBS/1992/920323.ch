]Something odd happened 2 minutes before this session. CBBS gave me
a string of odd characters including "dirty" words. Unfortunately,
I didn't print the screen. (Maybe that is just as well.).

Msg 45548 is 08 line(s) on 03/22/92 from BILL WOLFF
to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/BUY CGA MONITOR?

Yes that is what I use on my laptop. An $129 CGA color monitor that I
bought from Damark. Though I believe others may have them as well.
You might want to check out Sears for a CGA monitor too.

I didn't know that a EGA monitor will work on a CGA card... thanks
Mike for the information. I know that 15 to 9 pin adapters are
around, though I thought they were for multi-sync monitors hooked
up to CGA cards.

Msg 45549 is 21 line(s) on 03/22/92 from JERRY OLSEN
to ALL re: COMDEX/WINDOWS WORLD

I have a few extra complimentary exhibits-only passes for the
Comdex/Windows World trade show at McCormick Place on 6-9 April.

Also, I am hosting an informal gathering of those in the shareware
industry attending the trade show at Monday's Restaurant and Bar,
75 W. Harrison (between Clark and Dearborn in the South Loop area near
McCormick) on Tuesday, 7 April. (Yeah, "Monday's on Tuesday."...) Most
participants, from throughout the U.S. and abroad, will arrive shortly
after exhibits close at 5 p.m., but others will arrive throughout the
evening. This is a small gathering for eating, drinks, socializing--and
perhaps even some industry banter <smile>. (Note: There is a second
Monday's a few blocks north, which caused a small problem last year.)

If interested in either, the primary dialogue is being held on
CompuServe ("GO ASPFORUM"). But if necessary you may leave word for me
on The Advocate BBS, 312/939-4411, 300--2400 bps, 8/n/1, Loop area--or
fax me at 312/939-3300. To receive passes, leave complete mailing
address and check CIS or the BBS for confirmation. (The supply isn't
unlimited!) To attend the dinner, indicate number of attendees and
whether confirmed or tentative. (Confirmed doesn't mean signed in blood
--more like "very probable"--important for arranging sufficient space.

to WARD CHRISTENSEN re: R/BASIC COMM

Ward,
   Interesting.... I'll make a mental note of that for future reference.
I suppose if it were 0, it would ignore the characters until the next pass
when, hopefully by then, one character would be added to stop the
looping effect that would result. No doubt, if a terminal stopped
displaying, someone would type a key after a while and get the ball
rolling again (assuming the worst case when say exactly 1K characters
came over the line.
)
