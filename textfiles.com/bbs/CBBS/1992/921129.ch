nks a bundle for your answers. I am planning to mention you
CBBS in my article (unless you have any objections).
answer you question, I am writing this for Illinois History
azine, for a special mass media and communications issue.
article involves BBSs, their future, and their roll is media andBBS,
mentioned it was for
e "club". Please explainI
, when I asked you abt the roll of BBSs in mass media, you
it was limited because not enough people have modems.
abt in the future when people do have modems (wont they?).
t (if any) do you think BBSs will affect mass media and why?
ase respond soon if possible.

Msg 45904 is 14 line(s) on 11/24/92 from WARD CHRISTENSEN
to ALL re: CBBS DOWN & BACK UP

 Well, sorry for our un-reliability again! This time the HST power supply
died, and CBBS was too specific to that modem to work with others.
 We're now on a Practical Peripherals 2400, with MNP capability, but it
does not seem to be going MNP.
 Randy sez that CBBS should be "generic" so any modem can be hung on it -
i.e. he'll init the modem with a terminal or terminal program, then CBBS
should just "connect". I think the default must not be MNP. He'll check
further, and I'll do what programming is necessary.
 CBBS has to at least hang in there long enough to get ot its 15th
anniversary celebration next February! Lets see, Saturday the 13th
of Feb should be the Sat closest to the 16th if I guestimated right.
for Pizza at Barnaby's on Touhy near California, 2:00 PM. (but call back
for particulars in early Feb).
 Thanks for calling CBBS - we enjoy having you.

to ALL re: MODEM SIGNALS

 Curious about something - our modem drivers for sending chars checked
if the transmit holding register was empty, then looped making sure clear
to send and data set ready were there, then send the char. When the HST
modem died, (power supply problems) and we tried other modems, they would
"hang". Is it normal these days for modems to not assert these signals?
 Thanks!
 P.S. a change in the drivers to ignore CTS/DSR was what got it going
again.

to ANDREI SCHEINKMAN re: REPLIES RE: CBBS

 Ya, CBBS has been "sick" for a week or so - bad modem, finally changed
software to be more "generic" and allow other modems to work - but now
we seem to have lost MNP (error correction).
 How old were we? Not sure of the relevance of that! But "about" 33.
 Why create CBBS? Well, there's a long story, but the short one was
(1) that I had an extra computer (I'd been doing some talks and bought one
to take with me); (2) Hayes had come up with the computer-controllable
internal modem; (3) I had a phone line - for club recordings about next
meeting, etc; (4) there was this terrible snow storm on Jan 16, 1978,
that kept me from going to work, so Randy and I got together by phone and
dreamed up the idea. I thought of it being for the club, Randy said that
just we two should do it - "committee" projects just don't go anywhere.
So we just did it. I patterned the software after the "cork board and
push-pins type of bulletin board", and coined the term "BBS" for it.
 The future of BBSs? more specialized, more commercial, more lines,
but also a lot of people just getting into it for the fun of it. Multi-
media, graphics (talked to a guy with A HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND graphic
images online, today - over TWENTY GIGS of disk.).
 Roll of BBSs in mass media? Well, there will be limited exposure -
things like library BBSs or perhaps a city's or village's council BBS
or something - but still not something of general appeal - just not
a high enough percentage of people with modems yet.
 Sorry you had trouble uploading your comment. HEY, in the future,
how about putting them in a MESSAGE instead of only-I-can-see-'em
comments? (Well, some assistant operators can also see 'em).
 Where are you doing this article for? Pardon if you already said, and
I've forgotten.
