  Well, a grand time was again had by all at the 14th CBBS anniversary
party - held every February Sat. nearest the 16th - this year it was
last sat the 15th.  Duffy Toler made a great lit headband that responded
to sound - an amazingly small circuit of his own design took sound and
used it to modulate a small 500V power supply, so the headband blinked
when there was noise - amazing!
  Mike Warot brought a big copper bus bar, to show the effect of eddy
currents caused by very very strong rare earth magnets - it was amazing,
the 'drag' of just moving a magnet across a non-magnetic surface.  Even
"dropping" the magnet onto the bus bar - it wouldn't hit hard- the eddy
currents repelled the magnet and let it down gently!
  About 25 folks showed up this year - half of last year, not sure why.
  It was at Barnaby's Pizza, Touhy & California.

to ALL re: DATA RETREIVAL

I got a call the other day from a salesman for a local area
computer service who said they could restore data from a hard
disk *chemically*.  He said it was a proprietary process, and
that they had done it for NASA.  (Does that say something about
affordability?)  It means that even with a head crash all is not
lost.  They never sent the brochure they promised, and I didn't
take down the name.  Does anyone know who they are?  I'd like to
contact them.  Thanks.
No dup. chars.
