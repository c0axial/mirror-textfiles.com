R/IDE SPEED/TIMING/LAPTOPS,
Ward,
   Close isn't even the word.  The BIOS table to large drive extender
works fine. (although it does generate over 1024 cylnders, but thats not
a real big deal today).  I also tried a SEAGATE 3283( 245 meg drive)
The results were the same.  Both eventually failed.
     The drive will work some times.  It will always boot and format, etc
Where it hangs up in particular is Windows install, eventually running
windows, and in DOS XCOPY.  This all seems to relate to large amounts of
data moving from sequential sectors on the drive, and the drive being
too quick.
   In all cases the PC drive access LED is on bright, and the drive shows
no activity.  In DOS, a time-out / read error sometimes occurs and you
get a re-try message and  can continue.
      As for the 20 to 40 meg change:  AS long as it is an OLD ide drive
(1st generation) there will be no problem.  Conner only made 20 & 40's
befor ethe changes I am running into were made ( no used drives to pick
up that might solve the problem).
    Does anyone know who's BIOS code TOshiba licensed for their laptops?

NORTH STAR,
I turned MY Horizon on a couple weeks ago. I was looking for an old
mortgage program I wrote once upon a decade ago. I had a LOT of trouble
remembering how to get a directory with North Star DOS, after having
gone through several disks trying to remember which one was configured
for the machine...back to PC-ville. Hey Ed? Stay outta trees!

FAN CLUB,
Well, I guess I keep my fan.  I opened up the case and the '386sx was
warm to the touch.  At least I've moved the machine so it isn't QUITE
so noisy.

LAPTOPS,
I'm looking to buy a '386sx laptop.  I sort of fell in love with a
Toshiba Satellite, model 1850 (25Mhz, 4 M RAM, 60 [I think] meg disk).
it was around $1300 or so.

I want this machine for DOS (DR-DOS actually), not windose.  Anybody
tell me whether I'd be making a mistake with this critter?  Or can
anyone recommend a nice alternative?

Thanks!

WHAT IS/COME WIRTH COREL SCSI,
AS I have been shopping around for SCSI cards, compatibility with
Corel SCSI seems to be a selling point.  I know they have Corel draw,
but can anyone shed some light on Corel SCSI, why one would need it if
your card ( assume ADAPTEC) comes with software?

QQ: WHY DO FLOP-DRIVES DIE?,
What is the commonest cause of a floppy drive ceasing to be usable?
I have one that obeys commands to home the head, etc., but has no
effect other than to cause a "Bad sector" message.  Is there a
particular component or connector that appears to be a weak point
on 5-1/4" drives?  (The one I have in mind is a Toshiba, model FD5022.)

R/HEAT & NOTEBOOKS,
  I'm wondering if perhaps there is an SL vers of the DX2 - perhaps Intel
has taken some of the SL-learned knowledge of low power, and applied it.
  I'm supposed to be getting a 486 SLC-2 (25/50) notebook soon...
Otherwise, whoo-ie!  That suckah is going to be HOT!
  I think we won't be seeing Pentium laptops for a while!

HOT NOTEBOOKS,
Well, a friend of mine refers to his DX2 (66) as a room heater with
a built-in computer, but on portables...?  The remarkable thing about
the '486 portables is not just the fact that they don't melt, but that
their claimed battery lives are quite long, comparatively speaking.
All that heat means wasted energy, and anything THAT fast is going to eat
power in any event.  So what's going on?  Have motherboard designs
improved all THAT much?
