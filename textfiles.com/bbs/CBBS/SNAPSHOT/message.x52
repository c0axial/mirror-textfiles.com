LAPTOP OR NOTEBOOK WANTED,
Does anyone want to sell a cheap laptop or notebook computer.
I need one for the summer and I don't want to spend more than
$500.  It needs only a 286 microprossor and a 20 meg HD.  It must be
able to operate over seas on 220 volts.
Thanks,
Donnie Stuhlman

R/FAN CLUB,
  > temperature sensitivity
  I had the strangest thing the other day.  I opened the lateral mail
drawer at work, and put my hand in to pull out something way deep in
my mail slot (a pendaflex folder).  I noticed it was warm.  I started
feeling around - bottom of the drawer, adjacent mail slots - I fully
expected someone's laser-printed listing to be nearby supplying the
heat, but I couldn't find it.  I started moving my hand around my mail
folder, and was amazed that I could "sense" a temp difference - I figure
it must have been only a couple degrees, since there was nothing around
that was supplying the heat...
  I also noticed how sensitive I am to "radiated" heat...

R/FLOPPY COPY PROT & SOLUTION,
  I hate to admit it, but "lawyers" is the best solution to your problem.
They should hire a lawyer and threaten the company due to the down days,
and be "willing to settle" if the company will come up with some scheme
to get around the copy protection.  I remember having my first MIDI program
be copy protected (and maybe even the one I use now, I forget) - and I
thought: "Boy, this is enough to make sure I never do professional MIDI
stuff - a little glitch on the hard disk and POOF you are D_E_A_D."

R/PS,
Well, no, I don't REALLY want to buy another Geneva; I have two now, both
with Dvorak keyboard on the system ROM, one with the 120K RAM disk and one
with the combo 64K RAM disk and the modem.  I have ZDE 1.6 in ROM!  But
another one, especially if the batteries are down, would not be a lot of
use.  Besides, I've never been able to get them to talk to my DOS
machines, so when I do take notes I have to bring the machine home and
hook it up to an Exec (actually, I still have an Exec hidden somewhere at
the office; I suppose I should set it up just for this -- or would it be
ecologically and economically sound to do some writing on it?  I'm sure
it uses a LOT less electricity than my 386-40!

R/ELECTRICAL QUESTION,
Andy,  most of the conduit in your building should be ground. It is
very easy to check using an OHM meter, and some wire.  If the
conduit is not at ground (assuming your building has metal conduit),
then you have some kind of rupture in the conduit.
Try several boxes in your apartment.  I'll bet at leased one box
will have some kind of metal condut link to the main breaker box.
The main breaker box can be used as a gournd (earth).  You can
check other possiblities such as using an isolation transformer and
try to establish your own ground, but this is a costly soulution.
Running a seperate ground wire down to the building fuse box will
be expesive also.

R/NEW USER,NONO
  We have a 286 with 82 MB drive that has UNIX (Microport) and DOS.
The UNIX was given about 50 meg and boots from the hard drive.	The
DOS partition boots from floppy.

R/DBIV?,
Ed:

Thanks for the offer, but I think that I'll stick with non-compiled
for now.  I've since learned that DBXL supports some functions that
aren't part of dBASE (such as the APPEND AUTOMEM function) and so that
might cause some problems.  Also, I keep tinkering :-), so compiled code
might not be as useful as I thought.  SIGH.  Thanks for the offer, though.

XMODEM DOCUMENTATION,DEAD
I have an old copy of XYMODEM.DOC which I recieved from Compuserve and I was
able to implement the protocol in a Windows comm program (see message to ALL)
but I wanted to find out if there have been any "official" enhancements or
additions to this document since 1989. If so I may be reached via Compuserve
USER ID 72700,3275 if you have the time or maybe you could leave me a note
on this system directing me to the source of such information. I don't want
to take up any more of your time than neccessary so I'll cut it short with
a Thank You, M. Glenn Lewis, Automated Microwave West, Las Vegas, NV. Bye...

R/XMODEM DOCUMENTATION,
  No, sorry, Glenn, '89 is way past anything I documented.  SO I have
no idea of "latest" or who would approve changes, etc.
  Saw your msg about switching between 7E1 and 8N1, sorry, no idea there
either - I've always used a comm program that just ignores parity and runs
at 8N1, and never had a system I couldn't connect to, so I never switch.
