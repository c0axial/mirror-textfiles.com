VESA ???,
Ward,
  My information says that VESA stands for Video Extended System Arch-
itechture.....
  I have also seen reference to VESA signals on the VGA adapter connector
that is found on IBM VGA cards, and copied by many of the 1st generation
VGA cards by others.  I do not know what they may have to do with todays's
VESA....
	Also, with caching disk drives, controllers, system software
(smartdrv, etc.) Netware, and motherboards, have we reached a point where
we are CACHED OUT and actually losing performance by everyone trying to
guess ahead for what we may want?  Most seminars I have been to say not,
but with 4 levels now possible in most machines it seems to be possible
that with all of this going on it could take longer to get something than
having none of it, or just one.

R/COMPUTER CHRONICLES,
The question was what was it Ward Christensen and Randy (I forgot his last
name and erased the tape) established in (date)?  No one had a clue on the
two pannels.  I was not impressed by their knowledge of the trivia this
time.  The people are interesting in a very strange way.

R/FAN CLUB :-),
Radio Shack uses a termister in their puters:  part# DBT103J-U.
Their fan turns on when the disk drive is going.

DIVERSIFIED TECH-COLOR CATCHER,
A freind pickup upa large blue box ( alnost looked like an IMSAI)
The box and assocaited stuff says:  Diversified Technology, Inc.
Color Catcher, the internal cards and the back say: @1986 Frederiksen &
Shu Laboratories Inc.
There were 3 PC/XT cards ( 8 bits) with a switch that setup for XT vs. AT
(so AT's existed)  It takes a 50 pin twisted pair ribbon cable from the card
to the box (only one connector)
It takes NTSC in, and output RGB, SYNC, Sub-carrier out and NSTC out.
I'm sure it had software but nothing came with it.  I have been able to
locate a Diversified Technology in the south somewhere but they only
make industrial rack mount computers and never made this:
  So what I need is:
       Can anyone tell me what this thing does/did ? (is it worth even
pursueing)?
	ANy phone number for this company or who ever might have bought
them out ?

DJ HICAP,
I've seen refills for it, so it must be.  At least one of the
refills for the high capacity cart includes a specially modified
cartridge, whatever that means.  I dunno; at $22, it's almost not
worth the trouble.  I just had one run out after six months and a lot
of paper.  Of course, I print mainly text; if I were doing more graphics
stuff, I suppose it would have run out sooner...
