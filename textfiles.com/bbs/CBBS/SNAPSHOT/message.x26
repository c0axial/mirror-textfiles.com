PROBLEM WITH 20 MHZ 286,
    I recently bought a 20 MHZ 286 motherboard.  But when I swapped
it into my true-blue IBM AT (6 MHZ) computer, it wouldn't
recognize the disk drives.  It would access the A drive, then
(half second later) the B drive, then got stuck in a loop trying
to reset the C drive.  The video and the keyboard appeared to
operate normally, with one exception:  The screen said "To run
SETUP, press DEL", but pressing DEL produced no result.  (The
screen also said "Press ESC to bypass memory test," and
pressing ESC did abbreviate the memory test.)
    Does anyone have any idea what the problem might be?  Might
the AT disk controller be too slow for this motherboard?
    Also, does anyone have any docs on this board and its jumper
settings?  There is no brand name stenciled on the board, but
the words "PC Chips" appear on a chip that's the same size
as the 286 chip nearby.  The BIOS is from AMI, copyright 1988;
one of the BIOS ROMS says "286 EVEN BIOS" and the other says
"KEY BOARD BIOS".  The number PCB9060D is stenciled on the
back of the board.
    Thanks for any help or suggestions you can give.

R/PROBLEM WITH 20 MHZ 286,
First, check the head alignment on the floppy drive.  Back in the
old days (when we USED floppies all the time) that was a common source
of trouble.

As to the new MB -- yeah, you need to run SETUP.  Are you using a 101
key keyboard?  If not, that might be the problem.  You need to get into
the SETUP in ROM so you can tell the BIOS what kinds of drives you have
in the machine, both floppy and hard, not to mention a few other things.

Also, you usually need to hit the indicated key as soon as the message
comes up on the screen; try that and see if it helps.

There MUST be somebody here familiar with AMI BIOSes; they're pretty
common (unfortunately for you, I don't have one).  If worst comes to
worst, you might be able to buy a new BIOS chip, with documentation,
and plug that in...

MEMORY >16MEG,
As I have tried to increae my understanding of this memory limitation
a little more, I am starting to get this picture:
  Some (usually older) hard disk controllers used to use DMA to transfer
data back directly to memory. (we are talking ISA problem here only)
The ISA bus only supports 16 bits of data and 24 bits of addressing.
ASking for a file or data to be loaded (DMA'd) at an address above
16MEG requires 25-32 bits; no 25th bit hence data is overwritten at the
lower 24bit address.
It seems that this is also a big problem with SCSI cards.
   Now, Istill don;t have a handle onthe following:
1) is it a problem with IDE drives ( do they DMA)?
2) HOw about VESA-LB controllers; they supposedly have direct 32 bit access
to the CPU and memory?
3) WOuld any oother DMA cards ( tape controllers, network adapters) have
this same problem, or do on-board buffers, orlower memory boundaries clear
this problem.  ( do the tape backups, Colorado card for example die in over)
16Meg systems.
