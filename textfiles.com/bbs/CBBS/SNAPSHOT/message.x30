REPLYING,
  Oh, I see, but I think since there IS a reply command on CBBS,
it is not all that hard to point to the wrong msg when replying - I see
it SO often on compuserve (also without private msgs) that I have a
"canned message" that basically says "you replied to ME not to the person
asking the question".

ARCHIVE PYTHON,
  Well, finally got my Archive Python (DAT) drive working.  Turned out
to not like Ultrastor or IN-2000 SCSI controllers - had to be an Adaptec.
Runs about 10M/Minute.	Each $13 tape holds 1.3G!  THAT is the best price
performer I've seen - but the DRIVE is still in the $1K arena.	(Someone
said "you can buy a while SYSTEM for that $$) but if I did, it STILL would
be a bear to back up!)	heh.

R/HAAALP,
Randy doesn't call CBBS, but I'll forward your note to him.  Try chinet
again maybe later Tuesday or maybe Wednesday... then again you didn't
give your ID, hope he can find your logon...

R/TAPE IMAGE BACKUPS,
  Tape backups seems an area with lots of "issues".  For example, Colorado
didn't have an OS/2 backup, then suddenly they did - turns out they were
supplying Sytos.  OK, how do you restore?  You boot floppies, then restore,
right?	NO!  Turns out Sytron made it a "PM" (Presentation Manager) appl,
so you have to have a "full, running OS/2" to do the restore!  Sheesh!
  This AM I tried running my 486, it told me my QEMM wasn't registered.
So, I renamed QEMM386.sys, and restored from a backup, and compared - sure
enough it was trashed.	CHKDSK told me C: was pretty hosed - turned out
TWO sectors got clobbered in the FAT, AND, FAT #2 was "synchronized" (often
I'm able to restore FAT 1 from FAT 2).	OK, clean a few things up, manually
"e5" (erase, but without touching the FAT) the cross-linked stuff, zero the
FAT sectors that were hosed.  Now it says my tape backup device doesn't
exist.	OK, re-boot, try again, it is OK.  BUT the tape isn't indexed.
OK, index the tape.  Takes 50 minutes.	Come back: "a severe write error
occurred on the hard disk, retry?".  RATS!  What IS going wrong here!!!!!!
  I turned off Smartdrv write cacheing, seeing if that will help....
   ---
  Back to your problem: unfortunately, a block-by-block backup wasn't that
popular or that good an idea because you could only restore to the SAME
drive, AND you couldn't have any new "bad spots", because by NOT being a
logical copy, it couldn't get around bad blocks, etc.  Also it was much
more difficult, if not impossible, to restore a single file.
  What I suggest you do is, for example, write your FAT using Norton's
DiskEdit, i.e. you go in with alt-F1 and that indicates Fat 1, then write
to a file (say, fat.1) on A:.
  As to really doing such an image copy, I can't think of a way, sorry,
other than hokeying up a directory and FAT to "point" to chunks of the
disk "or something".  Hmmm...Nothing real obvious comes to mind...

R/LONG TIME AGO,
CBBS is the best BBS around if the metric used to define best is
signal to noise ratio!!!

R/QQ:  <PAUSE> KEY SCAN CODE?,
Thanks for your response.  I presume you are saying that the
"make" sequence of scan codes for the pause key is E1, 1D, and 5; and
the "break" sequence of scan codes is E1, 9D, and C5?
Incidentally, I recently came across a book called
THE PROGRAMMER'S BIBLE (or something like that) that gave the
scan codes as E1, 1D, 45.  Does this jibe somehow with your reference?

NCR/SCSI DRIVES 7 ME.,
I came across a 40 MEG SCSI drive fro a MAC.  I jumpedered it for an
open SCSI port adress and installed it into a NCR 386SX/20 Micro Channel
computer.  I ran several of the programs, etc. that came with the PC, and
formatted the drive.  The Drives reported their correct sizes of 46 meg
and 40 meg ( correct figures)  The 46 was the C drive, dos 5.0 and was all
one partition, and it was there.
  WHen I went to fdisk the new drive (D), all it said was possible was 33
MEG ( almost like I was in DOS 3 or something).  I looked at the table
on C and it was fine, and full and 46 MEG.
    Did I miss something here?	THis is only my 2nd or 3rd venture into
the world of SCSI drives.

R/PROBLEM WITH 20 MHZ 286,
Any chance it could be an enhanced keyboard - looking for the del key
that's not part of the numeric pad?  At first it sounded like the KB was
bad but like you say ESC worked.  Hmmm.
  The AT disk controller could be too slow for the motherboard - go into
SETUP and see what you can do (he said, with frustration on his mind,
knowing SETUP doen't work!)...
  How about completely pulling the hard disk controller, and booting a
floppy?  It might give you a 1701 error (Hard disk controller failure)
but might let you boot the diskette.  "maybe" you could somehow figure how
to get into setup (like by poking around the ROMS in DEBUG).
  You say you have an EVEN and a KB ROM.  Sounds like you should have
an even and an odd.  BUT the fact that the msgs come out OK ("Press DEL
to run setup"), you should be OK.
  I presume you have a 1.2M drive, right?  I have some "extra" 360 1/2 hi
5.25"ers around here if that would help.

R/MEMORY >16MEG,
Another issue is Smartdrv - it has to read stuff in below 16M - called
double buffering or something.	Causes some problems.
  I still have only 8M, so not a problem and would probably go to 16
as my next step - I THINK I can go higher, but - as you're proving -
too many headaches if you don't need it.

R/HOT NOTEBOOKS,
I dunno how they handle the heat, it is truly amazing.	Maybe they put
a thermoelectric pile in and use the heat to charge the battery ;-)
