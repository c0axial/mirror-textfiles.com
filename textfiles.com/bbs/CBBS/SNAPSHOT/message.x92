BBS LISTING?,
There used to be a message on here that was a list of BBS phone numbers.
Is that message still here? (I couldn't find it) If not, does anyone
know where I could get such a list? or suggest some other local BBS's to
check out?

SOUND ADAPTERS,FROG
Ward:

     Has IBM anything new in the audio card area?  What I am looking for
is something that would be Sound Blaster/Adlib compatible and paly WAVE
files.	The card would have an adapter for connecting a CD-ROM audio line
onto the card internally, have a MIC and AUX input, speaker output ( amp-
plified or not) and joystick port.  The Sound Blaster that I have hangs
my MS Windows when sarting up in Enhanced mode.  I have to start Windos
in Standard Mode, quit Windows, then restart Windows in enhanced mode.
Creative Labs is of no hlep and points the finger at Microsoft and IBM.
Microsoft points the finger at Creative Labs and IBM says it is not
their problem.	I have never had a problem with IBM for support or
service.  Microsoft has been good to me so far.  Creative Labs I don't
trust any more, that is why I am looking for an IBM card.  I know what
I will be getting and can sleep at night.

R/1ST BBS QUESTIONS,
  Heh, not only don't I live in California, I live in the same house I did
when CBBS and XMODEM were invented.  I see you gave a 414 area code.  I was
born in West Bend, 30 miles N. of Milwaukee, and went to school @ Madison,
and graduated from "Milton", now defunkt.
  Facts: 1. I actually wrote "MODEM.ASM" and put it in the public domain
in late summer '77, and it was checksum only.  Keith Petersen modified it
to hard-code my "quiet" switch so it could run "unattended" without having
to remember the Q switch, and called that variation "Xmodem", a name that
stuck as the name of the protocol.
  2. I didn't do CRC.  I am TERRIBLE on names, I can picture him, his
Porche, his job at IBM, but am drawing a blank on the name as to who did
the CRC.  It may be online on the Ward Board (708) 849-1132, an ancient
CP/M machine that refuses to die, otherwise it would be off the air.
  3. Yes, CBBS went on the air in early Feb '78, we officially call it
the 16th, as that was 30 days after its conception (during a big snow storm
on Jan 16, 1978 - snowed in, had to do something)...
  4. Yes, Randy Suess and I did it.  Went something like this.	"Ring".
"Hey, Randy, how about working with me on a dial-in system for the computer
club - people could send in articles, etc.  I have an extra system and
the phone line used by the club for recordings".  reply: "Well, no, lets
put it at MY house since I'm in the city & You're in the burbs, and lets
forget the club - "committee projects" don't work out.	You do the software,
I'll do the hardware, when will you be ready?" - or words to that effect.
  5. The first BBS was NOT what you said - that sounds like a "generic" name
for it.  Its name was "CBBS", "Computerized Bulletin Board System", and
when it grew, it became CBBS/Chicago (as opposed to CBBS/NW in the northwest
for example.
  6. It operated at 110 & 300 baud, then via PMMI modem at variable baud
from 110-710, for folks who had the variable-baud rate PMMI.
  7. Yes, I conceived of the idea.  Patterned after 'Cork board' type BBS.

XMODEM CRC CALCULATION,
Ward:

	I have a document you wrote in 1982 describing Xmodem.	The funny thing
is that I can't get the crc option to work correctly.  My calculated CRC's
look nothing like those from the system I am receiving them from.

    Would you have any code sitting about I could have a look at?

	Thanks in advance for your time!!!!
