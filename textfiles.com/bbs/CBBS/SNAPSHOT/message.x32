READING MESSAGES,NONO
In a note you ask how to read new messages and if you should read "help"
better.  Yes.  Just do "help;read" or even "h;read" (no parens, of course)
and it will all be explained.  [If you forget to put the <;> between the
words "help" and "read" CBBS will do it for you.]  The method I use is
simply "qr;*" and  the new messages show up.

R/IDE SPEED/TIMING/LAPTOPS,
  As to whose BIOS they licensed, could you boot debug and go searching,
it might have a Phoenix or AMI copyright or something.

WANTED: CALENDAR DLL,
I need to find a windows dll that will allow a display of a monthly
calender, with the ability to click on a particular date, with the
date getting passed back to my app. I've been scanning cserve & other
BBSs, along with commercial packages to no avail. I wouldn't mind if
this were one component of a general function package. Any ideas, please
leave me a message here.

R/LAPTOPS,
The only negative comment I have is that when I was asked to help a friend
in the Phillipines get a replacement battery and floppy drive for his old
Toshiba laptop (dual floppy -- this was a few years ago, at least -- Toshiba
wanted an arm and a leg for each and both were back-ordered!  There was a
discount for exchange of the old disk drive, but only if you gave them the
old one at the time you ordered the new one.  Mind you, this is for a disk
drive they admitted hadn't been in stock in the US in over two months!	I
can't say what the current status of parts availability is.

I say this having just purchased a T1000 w/768K RAM card, one floppy, DOS
2.11, 512K base RAM.  The RAM card becomes "hard RAM" (a non-volatile
RAM disk), holds ProComm, NewSweep, DTA, SmartKey and VDE, leaving about
300K or so free.  With NO floppy access at all it runs over FIVE hours on
a charge (continuous).	Using the floppy at all reduces that somewhat, but
with VDE in RAM disk there's no need to use it.  The system does not do an
automatic shut-off (unlike my Epson Genevas; which also get >10 hours per
charge), but it's quite serviceable and it DOES have a floppy drive instead
of a tape microcassette drive!

Say, there's a note in the latest Mor-Atlanta newsletter from a guy in the SF
Bay area who has a Kaypro with 2 Meg RAM disk, 4 floppies, and also a
Geneva that he'strying to find a home for!

GALACTICOMM,
Hey, thanks for stopping by from Glacticomm HQ in Ft. Lauderdale.  I was
just in your fine city last Mon-Thu (boy, you sure turned the heat up!).
  Maybe see you at BBSCON...

R/PROBLEM WITH 20 MHZ 286,
Andy, as you surmised, the problem was the keyboard.  The AMI bios I
have works fine if I boot with a friend's 101-key keyboard (set to AT mode).
(The odd thing is that, with the 84-key keyboard, the AMI bios recognized
the ESC key but not the DEL key.  I thought those were two of the keys
that had the same scan codes on the 101-key as on the 84-key.)

Now all I have to do is get a 101-key keyboard.
