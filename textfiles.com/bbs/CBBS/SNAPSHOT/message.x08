VISA? VESA?,
  Help me understand.  There are two things these days with similar names,
prounounced like the credit card - or is one Veh-suh?
  One I understand is a graphics standard, probably implying a VGA/SVGA
BIOS, the other a hardware standard for local bus.
  Just what ARE the right acronyms?
  Thanks!

R/CONNECT OK?,
  After talking to you I tried to connect at 9600 again and the connect
failed.  I tried at 7200 and 4800 and failed to connect also.
I took your advice and tried at 2400 and I connected OK. The system seems to
only connect at 2400.

  I have been trying for some time to get the logon script to work correctly
I don't seem to have the knack of getting it correct.  I have also
been working on upgrading my machine with a new XGA-2 and SCSI w/cache
adapters.  I have also got the new 9517 display and CD ROM II items
installed.
Well this is enough for now.

FOR SALE,
I have an ALR Veisa 64K cache memory board for sale. Reasonable price.
I upgraded. This board will improve throughput on a 386/33 by 50%.
Similar results with 486/33. I used it with both. In perfect working
condition. Guaranteed to work as advertised. Works in any of the
Business Veisa, Power Veisa, or other similar systems. Cash. Leave a
nessage here if interested, and we'll discuss it. First reasonable
offer will be accepted.

R/NEED VGA TO NTSC OR RGB,
  Ah!  In my new technique with Computer Shopper - I call it "Read-And-Rip",
I DID rip out the pages that have the VGA-TO-NTSC converters.
  Company name is "Publishing Perfection".
  Product is JOVIAN LOGIC's VIN Plus - External box VGA to NTSC: $298.
(Hmmm, at that price, I might get one!)
  Company is at 800-782-5974.  (800-Publysh) heh.
  Hey, THIS is rare - they're in my home state - Wisconsin - 414-255-7600!
Fax -9640.  No address given - "Wisconsin" mentioned because the 800 # isn't
apparently valid in Wisconsin.

R/WINDOWS TERMINAL,
What do you mean, comes in waves?  You mean you get say 6 lines all at
once?  That's probably because Windows isn't that good a multi-tasker
(like OS/2 is).  SO it takes time away from your program for a while,
then gives it enough to print what has already been received.

R/INVITATION,
Hi, sorry you didn't get a msg from me the next day - been gone on biz
trip..	Dunno about the speaking invitation - kind of burned out on that,
the BBS "hobby" has gone so commercial, I've pretty much lost interest in
it - I figure after maybe the next BBSCON it will be way beyond what I'm
interested in.	Between BBSCON, Hackers Convention, and this year, the
Computers, Freedom, & Privacy convention award from the Electronic Freedom
foundation, I really am burned out on the computer related circuit (I
stopped going to COMDEX)...
  Well, I'll try to give you a call...
