SIMMS FOR SALE,
I just upgraded my computer to use new simms.  I now have 8 256K
80 ns simm chips to sell.  (That means 2 megs of RAM.) I want
$40 plus shipping for them.
Leave a message on my answering machine 312-743-4241.

R/READING MESSAGES,
Thanks Ward. I'll put the capture on and get the help to read offline. I k
knew it had to be easier than what I was doing. But I know you pioneers are
hardy stock. <g>

R/FAN CLUB :-),
  Hmmm, one thing I worry about is your "opinion" of "room" temp - i.e.
if it is 10 degrees warmer it might feel the same (80 vs say 70), but
in fact if the fan were off, you WOULD have hot spots - maybe the
processor chip, etc.
  When you have the covers off but notice no hot spots, you are open
to convection cooling (a place for the heat to go) that wouldn't be true
with the covers ON and the fan OFF.
  Sorry, I dunno about a thermostat.  I kind of like "white noise", and
have a couple fans running on CBBS-The Ward Board - and when I DID power
it off one time when it was having trouble, it was "eerie" to have a
house that is truly quiet for the first time in 10 years, heh.	I think
a thermostatically operated fan would be more annoying than one that was
on all the time.
  You should stop at Randy Suess's "Chinet Headquarters" - there were
SO many computers on, SO many BIG hard drives spinning, I said "What IS
THAT?" - Randy said "what?" I said "All that NOISE!".  heh.
  Owell, I'm going deaf anyway - makes everything seem quieter (grin).

ELECTRICAL QUESTION,
This hasn't been much of an issue before, but...  My spouse and I
are thinking of getting a PC for home use.  Problem is that my
apartment is wired with no ground -- not even the outlet boxes provide
a good ground (hot to outlet screw is ~25 VAC, which leads me to
believe that the grounding is THROUGH something else, if it's there
at all).  On the other hand, probably contrary to code, there are 3-wire
outlets in all rooms.  My question -- what are the odds of something bad
happening to a computer plugged into one of these outlets?  Obviously,
the only reasonable surge protection would be to wire HOT to NEUTRAL,
ignoring the ground.  Or, alternatively, could I run a wire (inside the wall
with a little help) down to the laundry room and clamp it to a cold water
pipe?  That's what we used to do in the old ham radio days, and I assume
that would also do the job for a PC.

We've also been considering a laptop (many have 2-wire supplies), but
they're awfully costly to get the same level of performance (25 MHz
386sx class) as the desktops...

NEW USER,3357
Hi all,
I'm new to the modem and shortly intend to obtain a 96/96 for business pur
poses.	I'm interested in Internet and Usenet etc...  I want to learn UNIX
and expand my computer knowlege.  I'm formerly an Atari user (64k-8bit/4meg
16bit)	Clones since they became afordable.  I have Unix 3.2 but need some
info about whether I can format a hard drive half Unix and half Dos, of if
I have to dedicate a machine to Unix.  Please pass on any info.  Tnx.

R/DBIV?,
  This is a little late to join the conversation, but I think I have what
were looking for.  Along with the dBASE IV upgrade (from 1.5 to 2.0) for
$99, I also bought the compiler for $199.  This may sound like a good
deal, but wait, there's more.
  The Borland dBASE Compiler gives the option of a full, standalone .EXE
file, and a "compact" .EXE requiring the presence of two .RTL (runtime
library) files.  In the application I bought the compiler for there are
seven .PRG files, totaling about 31K.  The "compact" .EXE file is over
180K, and the .RTL files are 150K and 1.5M.  That's right, almost two
megabytes of program files to run this compiled application.
Furthermore, I could not get the programs to run on a machine with only
2M of RAM.  Talk about FatWare!
  That said, the compiler does what I bought it for.  It allows me to run
multiuser applications on a network without buying multiple copies of
the development system.  It's not a speed demon, but it's reasonably
fast under Novell 3.11, and if you have a browse screen up and somebody
else changes a record, after a (settable) interval your screen will be
automatically updated.
  Still want your programs compiled?  I'll be happy to do it for you.

R/X.25=MULTI LINES,
Ah, thanks - I was wondering how they do it!  I wondered if X.25 was
perhaps a relatively slow speed - say 56KB, so too many 9600'ers would
really drag it down - but T1 is 1.544, so that should handle maybe
100 9600s!

CBBS 16TH ANNIVERSARY PIZZA...,NONE
  Dunno yet if it will be 2/12 or 2/19 - both saturdays, about equal
distant from the 16th - lets say the 19th.  Put it on your calendars...

It will again be at Banraby's Pizza on Touhy at about California, north
of the City of Chicago.
