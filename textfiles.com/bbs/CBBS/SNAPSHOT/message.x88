R/CABLES...,
  Oh, I see - you just ran the trackball cord THRU the keyboard loop -
ya, like you said - like wrapping the phone cord around a pencil - BUT
you HOOKED IT UP, ah, I see.  Not "induced".  Just making a single sort
of cable out of two since one is coiled.  Heh.	Sorry to be so dense!

WARNING: SILVA AUTO GLASS,
   Hope this isn't too off-base for this board, but...

   I bought a beater in February.  It had no radio (the previous owner,
who used his extensively, removed it before sale).  It also had a
cracked windshield which I wanted replaced.  I asked around and got
a recommendation to go to Silva's Auto Glass & Trim in Elmwood Park.
The price was right, etc. so I took it there.
   Then a few problems, like a leaking radiator, etc. made me hesitate
to put my $300 radio in my $600 car, so I waited to install it until
two days ago.  When it didn't work (3 FM stations and 0 AM), I did some
checking.
   The windshield, which they specifically said had the same built-in
antenna as the old one, did NOT have a connection from that antenna
to the "car" (the coax going to the radio).  The area where that wire
would have attached to the windshield was sealed over solidly with RTV
rubber.
   Fernando Silva this morning refused to make good on it.  He held
tightly to his 90-day warranty and ignored my protests that that
windshield never had a working antenna, provably so by the fact that
the glass was sealed over and the "car" connector was corroded by months
of laying bare and connectorless.
   If you do decide to patronize them, make sure to get everything in
writing AND to personally check every aspect of the work.  My personal
recommendation is to avoid them at all costs, as I feel very cheated.

MICROCHANNEL AUDIO CARD,FROG
      Anyone know of a good microchannel sound card that is being currently
marketed or will be before the end of this year?  I do not want or am
interested in anything built by Creative Labs like the Sound Blaster boards
or some of their other products.  I have had nothing but problems with
their products and technical support giving me the run around.

Thanx
