R/DBIV?,
  Interesting hearing what you did.  You might, if you consider enhancing,
add my idea of stepping thru for clearing checks (and deposits - I get 'em
electronically at work, and I DO want to manually check them off to make
sure I got everything - though of course the bank is going to be "more"
right than I).
  Also, why do you go out to supercalc for balancing?  I found it easy
enough to do in xBase.
  4K?  Wow!  Yes, the allocation unit problem is just as appropriate for
the PC as for CP/M...  As to combining procedure file, the ONE thing I
really like about FoxPRO (which I do NOT and never HAVE used though I
bought it!) is that it can have in-line procedures in the same file as
the mainline, so you can finally have a single, structured .PRG file. I
found the limitation of a single procedure file very confining - at work
I use it for all my 3270 API stuff, meaning ANY application I do which makes
use of the APIs can't have procedure files (not a REAL problem because I'm
writing all from scratch).
  One thing I do (in almost any language) is to make HEAVY use of STATEs -
i.e. the overall program is a big loop, and I have a single variable called
a 'state' that I change based upon what I want to do.  This is how to put
gotos into goto-less programming - i.e. the state indicates which part to
execute, virtually identical to doing a "goto" that section.  Very flexible.
  My check clearing loop (which you go out to SC4 to do) is only a dozen
lines or so - "if a deposit; if cleared then add to balance;" "if a check;
if cleared then subtract from balance", and just do this is a "while .not.
eof()" loop.  I do fancier things like changing screen colors based upon
each line processed (once I find the line with the 00 balance indicating
the oldest modified entry (such as the oldest check cleared in this pass).
  I am still AMAZED at how tight you wrote this!  My checkbook DBF is 44K
alone - but then again I would LOVE it to go back FOREVER - for example...

R/DBIV?,
  <checkbook program in dbase, continued>
  Did I mention about using my program to save me $20?	Master Card hit me
with a $20 annual fee this January, in spite of it being a "no annual fee"
card.  Reason is, if you have NO interest (I believe in paying promptly, and
not going beyond my means) in a year, then the "fine print" sez they can
hit you for a processing fee.
  SO, what I did was go thru my checks.DBF file, back 3 years, totalling
every check I ever wrote to this specific bank.  I then wrote a letter saying
that I chose them because of no annual fee, that I had lots of offers for
other cards (and in fact had just gotten a Gold no-fee Visa card), and
stating the many K$ I'd spent in these 3 years, and did they want to lose
me over a little $20 fee?  Well, I fully expected to get another bill,
WITH INTEREST, in the mail, which I'd probably pay, then turn in the card.
Instead, I got a ZERO balance bill the next month, and have switched to
using the M.C. over the Visa (though being the (?? anal retentive ??) type,
I hate both bills - with their stupid advertising and "tear off flap before
mailing" type of ad- for as dumb a thing as "Thighmaster").  Actually I
(with serious topic drift here) got the Visa because THEY were from a small
bank with NO advertising and a nice simple (read: user friendly) envelope,
from Gary Wheaton bank.  Well, 3 months later 1st Card of Chicago bought
'em and I'm back to the junky ads and 'tear off flap' silly envelopes.	heh.
  ----
  Do you write much xBase?  I have a 3270 terminal emulator in it at work,
a publication order system, and at home, a backup-tape logging system,
and a HUGE and complex VCR log - each tape assigned a 3-digit code, with
quick-search (type one letter, it positions to and shows the first match,
hit the 2nd letter, it goes down to the 2-letter match, etc).  Ability to
compute durations, elapsed times, search for artists, titles, sort 3 ways,
etc.  A VERY VERY comprehensive VCR library, including hooks to Smart Label
printer, etc.  I really like xBase.

R/CHIP PRICES,
The reason chip prices are jumping is that a big plant in Japan(?)
went up in flames.  This plant produced 60% of the epoxy that is
used in chip manufacturing.  The entire electronics "foodchain" is
affected by this until alternative suppliers come on line.

Check is in the mail.  Thanks.

NEED A CHEAP 286,
ps-1 or is it ps2 and is comfortable with them,are there any dealers
ps1 and ps2's and he would be comfortable with either one,are there dealers
that sell these used or anyone have one to sell?

PS2-70 CMOS,KILL
Can anyone help me in getting a ps2 model 70 up
and running.  This belongs to a friend and the CMOS
data was inadvertantly lost when the battery was
disconnected.  Since he got the machine used from
a former employer he didn`t get the startup disks.
Does anyone know if IBM sells the Startup reference
disks alone and who I can contact.  Or is there someone who can get
me a copy of the startup.  At this point the C: drive is not
accesible.  Thanks for any input.

RESISTOR<>FUSE!!,
While you could consider any 'weak' link in a system a fuse, resistors are
not really a good choice.  When they do, they tend to 'flame out'.  A 1/4
watt resistor is not much more than a signal resistor.	You can commonly find
them in things such as transisitr radios.  They power needed to run a fuser
lamp would fry one immediately.
    It would seem that you have a typo in what you read, or they were
trying to specify a fuse type.	Just a suggestion.

R/ENVELOPE PRINTING,
     Thanx for the info, but it is not what I asked for.
