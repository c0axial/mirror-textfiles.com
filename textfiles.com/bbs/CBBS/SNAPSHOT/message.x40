BBS,
  Heh heh.  Funny how things go.  I INVENTED the term Bulletin Board
System, and I CHOOSE to make it a message-only system, which it is.
  So I was very amused by your message "Where are the programs?  I thought
this was a bulletin board system".  heh.
  Sorry, you're looking at a piece of history - the worlds FIRST BBS,
and it never has had programs.	Being a single-phone-line system, file
transfers would "kill" the ability to handle any message traffic.
46141,14,03/11/93,WARD CHRISTENSEN,MICHAEL CAIN
NEW MESSAGES,
  My choice on new msgs is to read "*" which means "the first new message
since your previous call", so: r;*	would read the first new msg.
You can then REPLY to that msg, or type "." to go on to the next message.
You can back up one message by typing ",".  Sorry, it isn't very
consistent - CBBS is a bunch of "hacks" that make up a BBS program.  These
were all add-ons.  I'd already used "+" to mean "automatically read
the next 10 messages", otherwise it might make sense for + to mean to
read the next message.	Theoretically you can "run" CBBS without ever
typing a msg number.
  What you MIGHT do is first issue the command I do:  o;*     which
will give you a one-line summary of new msgs, then r;*, etc.
Also when o;* is typing to you, you can press enter when you see an
interesting message, and type its msg # when prompted.	You can "shortcut"
msg #'s also, i.e. 12345;6 means 12345 and 123456.

MOVIES & COMPUTERS,
I've had a number of computer boxes done of late. They design the entire
package on a computer, the computer does the color separation, and the
computer outputs directly to negatives. In my case the boxes were done
at 2400 dpi on negative sheets that are 3 feet by 2 feet.

From what I've heard, movies are done in the same way, only they have
special computers - the resolutions are higher than 4000 dpi.
46341,11,06/23/93,WARD CHRISTENSEN,GARY ELFRING
R/MOVIES & COMPUTERS,
  First, curious what you mean by "computer boxes" (...done of late).
  And the resolution/size scares me - 2400 DPI B/W would be 720K bytes
PER SQUARE INCH - or over 5 million if we talk 8-bit color.  Multiply
that by a 2 x 3 foot area - that's 800 square inches - we're talking
4 billion byte images.	Or am I missing something?  (like a 2400 dpi
negative BLOWN UP TO 2 x 3?
  This amazes me.
  Yet again the quality of the screen images amaze me, so maybe it is
some incredible density/size...
  Curious to learn more.
  Thanks!  VERY interesting!

X.25=MULTI LINES,
Ward,
  I was scanning old messages here and noticed that in September you
were asking about some information you had picked up on using X.25 for
multiple-line BBSes.  In case you never got any information:

  I've seen some information in the Telecom Digest on the Internet
lately about this.  Apparently a number of companies, including U.S.
Robotics, make devices that will attach to T-1 circuit(s) from the local
phone company and supply an X.25 interface.  [A T-1 circuit in this
context supplies 24 voice circuits -- an equivalent digital bandwidth of
56kb for each.	T-1 circuits are frequently used for connections between
the local phone companies and company-owned PBX equipment.]

  The normal way to connect modems to phone lines coming through a T-1
circuit would be to connect the T-1 into a Channel Bank, which would
then break the circuits out into 24 4-wire phone lines.  You would then
hook individual modems into each of those lines.  Apparently these
devices you heard of "pretend" to be modems to the 24 voice circuits and
present the data to individual SVCs (Switched Virtual Connections) over
an X.25 link.

  These products are probably targeted to companies that have mid-sized,
or larger, mainframes.	Most Unix mainframe manufactuers offer software
and hardware to handle X.25 connections.  I'm quite sure that other,
propriatary mainframes can handle X.25 on their front-end processors.
(I have an X.25 port at work on one of my front-ends for the Unisys
A-Series mainframes I support, and another one on a U6000 Unix box.)
If you can't support X.25 directly (because, for instance, you have a
LAN-based BBS system) an alternative would be to plug a multi-port X.25
PAD into the above-mentioned equipment.  This could then break out the

X.25=MULTI LINES (CONT.),
SVCs into individual serial connectors (optioned as DCE ports) that
would appear to be modems to the serial ports of the PCs.

  As I said, I just heard about these devices recently.  I've been
meaning to contact USR about them.  I'd be glad to pass on any
information I get.
