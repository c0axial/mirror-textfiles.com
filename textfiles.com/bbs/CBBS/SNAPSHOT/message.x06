R/VESA IDE CONTROLLER,
  I have always argued, that the disk spins at a certain bit rate below
the heads, and you can't go faster than that, so based upon that, "yes",
you're right - only will CACHE really help things.
  I kind of wonder what the trade-offs are between cache on a drive, and
cache in memory.  I presume some drive caches are maybe a track, assuming
sequential access.  I think Smartdrv can read-ahead, but then again Brett
Glass in InforWorld mentioned that that can cause problems on a drive that
doesn't make bad spots invizobobble: namely it doesn't look at the fat and
compute where the bad spots are, so it can "go away for a while" trying to
read a bad spot, because lets say cluster 1234 is what you read, but 1235 is
bad - smartdrv might read-ahead trying to read say 8 clusters, and would
than "hang" for a while trying to read the bad spot.
  Interesting thought: IBM's ValuePoint had an STB accelerator board of
some sort, and in spite of not being local bus, performed better than Dell's
local bus implementation.  So just being Vesa isn't sufficient to mean that
it is REALLY fast; a good vesa implementation will of course beat a good
ISA implementation.

LINEFEEDS?,
  Hi, and thanks for being around - nice to see a name that has been
calling for years.
  I'm curious: why did you ask for help on "linefeeds"?  Are you getting
double spaced output or something?  Shouldn't be unless YOUR software is
translating a received (or even sent?) CR into a CR/LF, then CBBS sends
the obligatory LF, so you get double spacing.  (Anything TANDY related?
I remember people having problems with their printers since they auto-LF'd
when they'd get a CR, so MOST software could cause double spacing.

R/NEED VGA TO NTSC OR RGB,
  Do you get Computer Shopper?	There is some company that specializes
in publishing things - scanners, etc.  I recall seeing (some months ago)
an external NTSC conversion box.  I think it might cost a lot more to
handle EGA (digital color) AND VGA (analog color, different frequencies,
too).
  Sorry I don't remember the name - I'll try to remember to jot it down
if I come across it again (got a new Shopper last week).
  Otherwise, Willow (Peripherals?) - Willow Ave, Bronx, NY. makes an
AT-but NTSC output VGA.

CBBS FROM A MAC,
  Gee, pressing S for ^S i.e. to stop/start scrolling, and pressing C
for ^C and K for ^K to cancel a bit or kill out completely should work
at all times - except when CBBS is busy doing something like writing
to the disk.  Also if you type an invalid command such as "new", it
executes a "synonym" which happens to have ^K disabled, but then you'd
see the message:
	++Can't Ctl-K now
so I'm wondering - did you see that?
  Sorry you had problems.

STUFF,
I spoke too soon!  While I don't have the BASIC ROM, I just found the
modem wedge.  This'll give you a 300 (WOW) baud modem, plus a 64K
external RAMdisk -- so you'll have a full 64K TPA in the Geneva.  It
has its own battery that charges from the Geneva's PS, and plugs right
into the Z80 bus on the back of the machine.  Along with it, I found
the Portable Calc ROM -- a little spreadsheet.	I'll wrap this up and
send it off on Monday.	Just plug it in and screw it on (and reset your
machine) and you'll like the Geneva even more!

R/STUFF,
Heh, that will be cute.  It IS interesting seeing the Geneva, thinking
about it being the next generation after my HX-20.  I still suspect a
bad cell in my HX-20, should take it apart and see.

R/GOOD CONNECTION,
  Yes, I wrote CBBS, originally in '78.  Mods thru early 80s, then
"frozen".  So a trip here is like a ride in a Model T, heh.
  What is a "quoting system"?  Heaven forbid people pulling quotes from
other messages!  They shouldn't be so lazy - I could pull an entire paragraph
from your msg or say "Quoting system?" and get the point across.  No, there
are no changes planned for CBBS, that would cease having it be historical.
  I have no idea how many users.  Not many.  The user database keeps track
of the last 1000 callers, and many go back months if not years.  CBBS has
only a couple hundred calls a month.  Kind of tempted to just pull the plug,
but folks @ BBSCON say the first system should keep going.
