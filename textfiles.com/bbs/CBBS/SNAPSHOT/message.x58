DISK CLEANUP,
Hi Ward.  Have you had a chance to try out the PCMANAGE program and test
it for your disk clean up purposes?  Haven't heard much about that recently
so thought I'd ask, and I was curious to see how you made out with it.

DBIV?,
Greetings, all.  I'm looking for someone with the new version of
dBase IV (someone with the compiler).  I've recently written a little
application, and I'd like very much to see how it compiles.  It's written
in dBase III+ (DBXL, actually, but it's the same thing), so it should
compile under IV without any problems -- but I don't have the $$$ to spend
for the compiler.

So, if anyone out there would be willing to compile a small bunch of
code, I could send you a disk and you could return it, or I could send
the code via Internet...Thanks in advance.

Oh -- the program is a little check register/banking manager.  I wrote
it because the commercial programs I looked at were serious overkill,
and because the one I tried added 1+ meg of files to my disk.  Since I
already had a database, I figured I could dump most of that... :-)

THE CBBSLIST,
Ward-

First of all, allow me to introduce myself.  My name is Paul Chartraw,
and I have been editor of the CBBSList/Stillwaters List for the past
year and a half, and have offered it a 'home' since the beginning of
this year.  I have meant to contact you since November or so, but as
you know, things always seem to get in the way of doing what you WANT
to do.	I dearly hope that there is no ill will towards my usage of the
CBBS moniker, I understand you 'own' it, and granted it's use as the
filename in the Stillwaters List-era, and hope that you do not have a
problem with it's use as the NAME as well as the filename.  The reason
I chose to rename the list to The CBBSList is that simply it was no
longer housed at Colby's system, and he asked me to differentiate it
somehow so that he would not continue to be overrun by the callers, and
it seemed simplest to me to keep the familiar, etc, etc.

Feel free to contact me voice at 708-748-6816 evenings after 6pm, or via
my system, The Hideaway BBS, at 708-748-1911.

PS - Ya know, if it wasn't for you, I'd NEVER have had this
     much fun.	('Course, my phone bills'd be cheaper, I'd
     have more time on my hands, I'd stil have most my hair.....HMMMM)

GENEVA,
It has a serial port, all right.  I've had my Geneva hooked up to a
PC for YEARS with no trouble.  To several other machines, as well.

Say, you don't want a bit of computer history for $40, do you?	It's
exactly the same size and weight as a modern laptop, but it does
so much less!!

R/GENEVA,
  Does the Geneva execute a basic?  i.e. does it come with one?  I might
be interested - it WAS a system I had considered at one point.	Besides,
my 10-year-old-laptop died!  (Epson HX-20 - GREAT early machine - tape,
printer, screen, BASIC, etc.  Problem with it, was that it could have
been a great "hackers" machine but they refused to release the internals
documentation until it was a dead product.
