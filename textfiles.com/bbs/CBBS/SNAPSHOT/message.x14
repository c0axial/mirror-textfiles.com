68000,
I can do you one better: I've still got a 4-MHZ one lying around (no
plastic box, though).

VOICE INPUT,
I've had a chance to play around a little with Voice Blaster, a hardware/
software combo from Covox that lets you use a SoundBlaster or clone for
voice input.  It can recognize up to 1023 words at a time (though they admit
that speed and accuracy will be poor with such a large vocabulary).  It's
speaker-dependent and requires training.  I've had mixed results with it,
but they admit that support for the PAS-16 sound card that I have isn't quite
there.	I haven't had time to open up the machine and stick the old
SoundBlaster back in and try it out (it has a test function that lets you
play back the word that it tried to recognize, and I found that with the
PAS it was chopping words up).	Cost $69.95 at Comp Usa.  Might be useful
for entering control-key sequences or the like without straining the
wrists (it also works well with a word-predictor program I sell).  Current
support is DOS only, though they've promised a Windows version.

MCIMAIL-->ATTMAIL/LAN,
we have our MSmail system up and running with a gateway to ATTMAIL.
I can exchange mail with compuserve via the X.400 interface, and the
internet too.  I would like to try and figure out how to exchange msgs
with someone on MCImail - or even better, a LAN with a gateway to MCIMAIL.

discuss with me a possibility that we could see you at BBS EXPO!

Hope that isn't the case.. because I think that you would see that

EXPO.. getting back to the basics of BBSing Today and Tommorrow.

Please leave me a voice number to call you and I will be glad to
get in touch with you at hours you feel are the easiest to reach
you... or... I can be reached all week at home starting at 4pm

Happy Thanksgiving day and thanks for considering talking to me about

R/DJ HICAP,
I was able to peel the top off several cartirges but one needs to be
carefull. I placed the cartridge on its side and used an exacto knife
to score a like down the seam where the cartridge is glued together.
After the line was scribed, I was able to find a few small places
where I could get the blade all the way through. Then I used a hammer
and tapped the exacto blade down the cartridge, and was able to pop
it open. Sometimes it wont pop clean and leaves a raged edge. I used
a new exacto blade and cleaned it up, or a dremo drill. Occassionally,
you will find one that's impossible to open, they used ALL the glue
on that cartridge that they left out of the others. I've also opened
the color cartridge, and have refilled it three times. Once you refill
it, use a little ruber cement to hold the top on. Works great!
Have fun!
