VESA IDE CONTROLLER,
I am noticing that VESA slotted ISA machines are now entering the realm
of reasonable and cheap.  At this time I find 2 types of cards that are
available: Video and disk controllers:

	Having CPU direct 32 bit access for video cards I can see the
benefit of ( while the cheaper ones support 24 bit color)  Does one
then believe that the 'true VESA" cards are 32 bit color, and 2M ram?
	As for disk controllers: (ISE & SCSI) with and without cache:
I guess I can see where the cache being 32 bit memory and directly
accessable will speed things up; but as far a direct data recall off
of the hard drive, I don't see this being any faster.  Data still comes
of off IDE & SCSI drives 8 bits at a time (right?)
	If ths is correct a non caching VESA controller would be a total
waste of money.
	Do I have all of this in perspective folks?

GENEVA,
Sorry, no ROM.	It looks like I got things well cleaned-out before I
moved.	There IS a clock in the Geneva (it's been called one of the
heaviest digital watches in the world) and it should be accessible.
It's VERY accurate; I set it to WWV and a year later it was right on
the $.	As for sound -- I think so.  There is a little speaker next to
the tape drive, and I know that some software will do neat things with
it.  BTW, if Antelope Freeway is still in business, they will have
some nice neat things for the Geneva.  Or I can give you a list of what
I can find in the Epson area on SIMTEL...

R/IBM CIRCA 1970,
I am quite certain that my friend told me about internal desktop computers
at IBM around 1970 (give or take 2 years). I left Cincinnati in '73, and
I was told about the desktops in Lexington before I left. At the time I
had no real concept of what a personal computer was, but his remarks about
this "strange" computer stuck in my memory.

APPLE MAC SE,
Being an Intel kind of guy, I don't know much about Apples. However,
my son's MAC SE has quit. I understand it's not worth much, but he likes
it and wants me to fix it. I've tried all the obvious stuff we all
recommend to each other. The screen exhibits a sort of checkerboard
pattern on bootup, interspersed with little unprintable characters, and
bootup does not complete. Anybody have any experience with this? Any
ideas? Anybody have an old MAC SE I could scrounge the logic board
out of? I might pay a little for a fix, but not much. If you can help,
I'd appreciate it. Thanks in advance for your help.

GOOD CONNECTION,
Nevermind about the speed, i can get a clean connection and that's very
good. I've read the TRUE history of how the BBS was born through a local
BBS which put the article in bulletin section. it's sure a long way. BTW is
this BBS program written by yourself? Pretty simple but if u can install a
quoting system in the message entry will be great. Tell me, how many users
are there in the system?

Bye!
