CBBS,NONO
  A caller asks:  "Where are your programs?  I thought this was a
bulletin board.  I am very disappointed."
  Don't people read the brief, but fully explanatory Welcome message and
Bulletin upon logging on here?	Do people not understand what is meant
when the Welcome message says:	"CBBS is a MESSAGE-ONLY" system catering
to advanced hobbyists. . . .See Bulletin for details."

R/TOSHIBA T1100PLUS...HELP,
  I think I can help - I have an 1100+, which I passed along, not sure
where it is right now... Can dig it up, I'm sure.  I'll check, maybe I
even kept a copy of or the original of the DOS.
  When you call in, leave me an address when you "G" (Good bye) -
make is to I can screen print it right to a label, i.e. name on one line,
then addr on another, city on the last... I'll send you something, perhaps
Saturday if I can dig it up.

SHADOW RAM -- TEST RESULTS,
You always think things are snake oil until...	I have an 'obsolete'
computer, a CompuAdd 386sx running at 25 MHz.  I've hacked around with
the software about as much as I was going to, and then I remembered the
BIOS -- by default, my machine uses 'shadow' RAM, and relocates system
and video BIOS to RAM.	In theory, this should speed things up.  In reality,
I was dubious.	So I decided to run the following test.bat file:
@echo off
superpck/f
timer
cls
d \bin\util
d \bin\util
d \bin\util
d \bin\util
d \bin\util
cls
timer
(This is running under DR-DOS 6.0/4DOS, but it's basically generic).
I start out by flushing the cache and turning on a timer, then clearing
the screen and running 5 iterations of a DIR command (aliased to D) that
gives me a sorted list of approximately 91 files.  Then I clear the screen
again and display the timer results.  Without Shadow RAM, it took around
9.7 seconds timer to timer.  With Shadow RAM enabled, just under 7.0 seconds
for the same thing.  So -- sometimes these things they sell you really work!
I should note that I run with BREAK OFF -- putting BREAK ON added about
.2 seconds to the time.

So, if it's speed you need, THE SHADOW (really!) KNOWS!

PS,
Yeah, I still have MY Geneva (though my Kaypros are LONG gone), but
we need a machine that'll do VGA (games for the kids, etc) so the
handbook, while nice, is out.  I tried the Toshiba 1850 at a COMPUSA
store in Northern Virginia, and it was very nice, both w/respect to
the screen AND the rd (a little blast of lif*ne noise
here).	You wanna ~2{buy another Geneva, Ben?  This one has VDE 2.11
(if I recall) burned into a ROM, along with some other useful programs.
If you're interested, I'll sell it cheap (I think I still have the
modem/RAMdisk, even...)

R/PROBLEM WITH 20 MHZ 286,
Glad it worked!  Once you get used to the 101 key layout (which DOES take
a while) you won't want to give it up.	Just make sure you get a good
one (I like the NMB technologies keyboards, myself).

ONE BBSCON,NONE
  Just got back from ONE BBSCON (the ONE means Online Networking Exposition).
This is a BBS related convention.  Last year, 1000 attended, this year, just
under 2000.  Next year, they predict 3500!  I think it will be at Atlanta
  The program started of an opening session, with Jim Warren as keynote
speaker (he has been involved in the industry for many years - Dr. Dobbs
Jorunal, Micro Times, Electronic Design News, etc).
  It then went into optional sessions, two every AM and two every PM, with
some "Birds of a Feather" to round it off in the evening for topics come
up with after the original program was created.
  There was a very large exhibit hall, with everything from modem mfgrs
(US Robotics, Hayes, Supra, Zoom, Xyzel or whatever that strange one is,
etc), to all the BBSs, multi-port board vendors, vendors hooking to the
Internet, PageSat with their Internet news feed by satellite, (and a
competitor giving more - Ilink, Fido, etc, but at $30/month right away,
and not $30/month AFTER 2 YEARS like PageSat).
  I gave a session on the BBS history, kind of expectedly lightly attended -
it was up against Dr. Vinton Cerf, the internet inventor, doing a big spiel
on the internet.
  It was held at the old but nice Broadmoor hotel in Colorado Springs.	They
picked up my hotel bill, but I had to do my own airfare.

ALKALINES RECHARGEABLE?,
Browsing late night TV, I came across an infomercial for a device
that recharges alkaline batteries.  The emcee, Dick (I had typed
"Disk"!) Clark, pointed out that this device worked with otherwise-
nonrechargeable alkalines because it uses a very low charging
current, controlled by a high-tech circuit developed by a professor
at McGaw university.  At this point, they showed a video clip of
the professor fiddling with some circuit board that was about the
size of an adapter card for a PC.  They're asking about $40-$50
for the device, as I remember.
   My minimal electronics savvy leads me to suspect that this device
works by keeping the charging current constant (and small--like
maybe a tenth or a hundredth of volt?), whereas normal battery chargers
are designed to keep the voltage constant (like 1.6 volts?).  But I suspect
that the circuitry to accomplish this requires only a handful of chips,
rather than the twenty to thirty that the infomercial implies.
   Assuming such a device is feasible, my question is, Would it be
relatively simple to build such a device from parts bought at Radio
Shack?

R/ALKALINES RECHARGEABLE?,
Roy, battery charging depends strongly on the species of battery. Batteries
that become polarized when they are discharged are difficult to impossible
to recharge because the reverse polarization at the anode and cathode inhibit
charging currents (in effect). Carbon-zinc batteries are good examples of
this. Over 20 years ago I read a NASA paper on recharging carbon-zinc (lebold)
batteries. The author found he could recharge the batteries numerous times
by using a real simple circuit. The circuit placed a small AC ripple current
on top of a DC current. I think it was a badly filtered 1/2 wave rectifier.
The AC ripple apparently overcame the polarization problems. I've often
wondered if these chargers are rip-offs of this circuit.
