68000 FRIMWARE?,
Looking for a simple monitor for a processor. I am not sure
were to look for such an animal.  The monitor sould be able to
read an write character from a RS232 port via SIO.  The monitor
sould be able to get around some memory, and should be able
to be able to other useful things necessary for micro development
I would like to buy the source code.  Code should be written in
68000 assembler.  The processor being used will be a 68008.
thank you.  Please leave a repy on this bbs.

R/VOICE ON THE INTERNET,
Voice e-mail is here. Where I currently work, the Mac is the computer of
choice. Two weeks ago MacMail was upgraded and now supports voice mail
attachments. Right now it is a novelty and not used by most people on the
[D
Anyway its here, and I suppose I'll end up using it out of forced necessity.

R/DBIV?,
Wow!  I like your check system (fun and profits)!  I do like going out
to SC4 just because (a) I can do it, and (b) I feel a little more
comfortable with the math there.  Remember, this checkbook program
started out as a very quick hack to replace what I think of as an
ugly bit of commercial software.  My major consideration was not to
have to re-enter all the stuff already in the .dbf file.  Happily,
the checks were stored in dBase compatible form, so that was simple.

I've done xBase stuff on and off since the days of my Kaypro 2'84 and
dBase II.  I guess I really got into it when some people at work
(then the American Bar Foundation) needed a couple of HUGE data entry
systems for projects they were doing.  I looked at the manuals and
figured I could probably do it...  In one case, they had so much
information that for each record I needed to string together five (5)
DBIII+ files.  Yep,er 640 distinct fields for each record.   So,
I learned.  I never had my own copy of dBase III, etc, though.	A couple of
months back, I happened across a copy of DBXL 1.3, a III+ clone (the
rights have been sold to Borland) for $20 at a show, so I bought it.

One thing I did learn, BTW, is that (at least in DBXL) the main .PRG
file can also be opened as the procedure file, so you can have the
main program and subroutines all in one box.  I like your idea of 'state,'
though -- I'll have to consider how that can work.

Do you have an internet or bitnet address?  If so, I'll send you the
code to my checkbook if you send me yours.  It'd be fun to see if your
Foxbase code would run under DBXL, and vice-versa.  You can reach me
at marchana@gar.union.edu -or- marchana@union.bitnet.

R/GENEVA,
So is the computer!  You should get it in a couple of days via UPS.
I packed it in the Zenith 386sx box; they're just about the same size!

GROUP,
Ward,
  The GROUP number on the fax is as best as I can tell their designation
for 'modem vis standards'  Very OLD faxes are/were group 2 and I believe on
had a max baud of 2400.   Group 3 will fall back if connected with an older
fax machine.  Group 3 is the current modern day standard, although I also
thought it contained a max specified baud of 9600.   Hmmm. Maybe that's
why some machines didn't like my 14.4K faxes.
    I am still finding the quality level of connections/fax interrogations
to be quite a problem.	I called 3 different fax back systems and
got connectionsa at 4800,2400, and 9600 baud.  Without having another
brand to test side by side I don't know if my modem is just 'too sensitive'
(ala inexpensive) or if its just plain bad luck.
    While my explaination of CLASS is accurate, I am finding that in
practical application it does not apply.  The sticking point seems to be
old faxes where you dail and manually press a send button after answer
do not like fax modems ( or at least class 2's) whereas drop and send
faxes seem to work fine.
  Can anyone shed some light on these problems?

Call the IBM BBS, 919-517-0001, and find your way around - I think there
is even a command "REF DISK".

R/RESISTOR<>FUSE!!,
They insist that it's not a typo and that it's a resistor used as
a fuse.  The LaserJet III Companion has no reference to fuses in the
index.	I don't have the manuals for my LJ1 and III here, they are at the
office.  I suppose I should call HP's Tech Support and ask them what
fuse (if any) is used!

Thanks.

R/RECHARGABLE ALKALINES,
Let's see.  There's one Phillips screw on the back.  Prying with a screw-
driver (U.S. Robotics model, natch) reveals a very tight fit between the
base and outside sections.  Aha!  It's open.  (If I can't get it back
together, you owe me one!)  Big transformer in the center, no surprise.
There's a Motorola chip labelled XC78160J4/XXAB9336.  A bunch of resistors.
[Not used as fuses, no doubt!]	Four devices with a Motorola logo marked
2N/4401/337.  These are black, flat on one side but otherwise cylindrical.
A fifth device of similar color and shape is labelled K982/3H and lacks
Motorola's "M".  I have no scope and dunno much about the stuff.  I haven't
yet tried recharging regular alkalines or NiCads, and am not sure that I
will (don't have any NiCads around -- I long ago learned that I didn't
have appropriate uses for them, most of the things I wanted them for were
not used hard enough to make them worthwhile).
