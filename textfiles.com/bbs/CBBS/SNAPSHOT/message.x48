BBS,
You know, it occurs to me that CBBS is one of the only systems that I
run into that supports any level of discussion.  There are a number of
boards here (upstate NY) that are oriented to files, and sometimes they
get poorly spelled, ungrammatical, nearly obscene messages -- but not
often.	I think that one reason CBBS has survived is that it provides a
place where people can come to talk.  I remember coming on here in '84 --
I had just bought a Kaypro, and somebody loaned me a modem and a copy
of MDM737 or somesuch, and it had CBBS in the dialing directory.  I think
that if it had not been for this board, I would be sitting in front of
a Mac or Windows screen right now.  Instead, here I am with a truly
non-standardized arrangement of various softwares, thanks to the things
that I learned on this board.  Hey -- here I am in upstate NY and I'm
STILL calling (can't get decent pizza here, though).  Whatever you do to
CBBS, Ward, keep it ALL MESSAGES.  Thanks!

WRITE MESSAGES,FROG
     Ward is there a way that I can transmit  text to the message
message file without having to type in all of the text.  I have
tried several times with out success.  I have been able to do this
on several other BBSs.	Can you help?  This would a great shortcut
to sending a lenghty message.

R/WANTED: CALENDAR DLL,
Are you looking specifically for a custom control that can be used by
dialog editors?  If so, Microsoft look or Borland look?  What's your
preferred message interface?  Buttons for switching month and year?

TONY ANTONUCCI'S BBS,
Say, anybody know what's going on with Tony Antonucci's BBS, Digital Delights?
It went down just before the 4th and hasn't been up since.

R/LOOKING FOR A JOB!,
Try contacting some of the contract houses like Pollak & Skan, Butler
Service, etc.  Many contract firms advertise in the Sunday Trib.

POWER SYSTEM,
   Gee, you'd think I'd be thrilled to have a 486/33, CD-ROM, Fahrenheit
1280 video, 8M, etc, but I'm not - in relative terms.  It is a DOG compared
to some newer local bus systems, etc.
   First, my video performance: a friend, in a program called "3DBENCH" gets
a 40 or something (number of frames per second it can compute and display),
while I get 12.2!
   Also, I bought a heavy CD-usage game called 7th Guest, and instead of
saying something like "Welcome to my house", off the CD-ROM, it says more
like "we......lc......om"  Actually I can't even tell what it is saying.
I think I need one of those double-speed CD-ROMS like from Texel or NEC (but
I won't buy NEC if I don't HAVE to since I hate them for screwing me by making
such awful VCRs, of which I have two (no, I'm not dumb, the first was a
Marantz, and when it went bad (head alignment) I bought a new one - a top-
of-the-line NEC - when IT started having head-alignment problems, THEN I
learned (1) NEC made the Marantz; and (2) NEC had eventually gotten such a
bad rep they got out of the business)).
   So, I'm looking at an EISA system with one VLB slot, a Cirrus local bus
video adapter (they're fast in DOS apps, not bad in Windows, and only $130
or so), either keeping my 486/33 or getting a DX2/66, and the double-speed
CD ROM.
   Any comments on the above?  I'm tired of buying new stuff and having it be
slow and/or obsolete (Bought an STB ERGO VGA, soon was recommended to go to
the Fahrenheit 1280, now it is a dog, etc).
   One issue would that it would be nice to have ROM-based 640 x 400 VESA,
as I think EL-Fish uses that but it seems fairly rare to have that.
   Thanks for your thoughts!

CBBS USAGE TIP,
   Most of you regulars probably know this already, but here's how I use
CBBS:
   1. Run the command "full" after signing on - this gives a full-LINE
(sorry, not screen) editor - with word back, forward, insert-a-space,
delete, toggle between front and back of line, etc.  This makes it easy
to type fast, then see a typo and back up a few words, insert a char, and
toggle back to the end of the line.
   B.  (If the Car-Talk guys can go 1, B, so can I).  Start retrieving new
messages with a r;* command - that will retrieve the first msg that arrived
since the START of your last call (sorry, that DOES make it retrieve YOUR
msgs if you left any last time).
   B2: Use the "." command to respond to the "Msg #:?" prompt, as it will
give you the next message number, and pause with another "Msg #:?" prompt.
   C: if you see something you want to reply to, type REPLY instead of
typing a '.'.  Here comes the shortcoming: there's no way to go back to where
you were - i.e. you have to look at the msg # you replied to and issue a
manual r;nnnnn command to get back into the loop where "." will retrieve
the next msg.  (Alternatively, you could start with r;-1 to retrieve one
msg back from the NEXT one to be entered - i.e. "retrieve the last msg"),
then use "," to BACK UP one message.  (easy to remember: , is on the < key,
. is on the > key).
   D: When you make changes to your msg via the editing commands, or you
accidentally leave input mode, you can list your existing lines then continue
by typing:    l;1;c	List from line 1, then continue inputting.  The only
slight shortcoming is that the listed lines are "nn text..." while the input
lines are "nn ? text..." so they don't quite line up.
   P.S. full-line editing is enabled not only while typing ANY input line,
whether a command or in a msg, but also when you "e;nn" to edit a line you
have put in a msg - you can move around the line, insert, delete, etc.
   Enjoy.

CELLULAR PORTABLE FOR SALE,
  I have 2 Motorola Ultra Classic Alpha's for sale.
  These are the thin tall portable with 100 memory locations, and each 
supports alphanumeric entries.
  These would be a good deal for anyone just wanting to keep their number
and swapping into a portable - as the carriers usually rebate the dealers
for all NEW number activations with $200-$250 to offset the cost of a NEW
phone for a NEW customer.  Existing customers wanting to change have to
bite the bullet....
  I also have an older thicker Motorola portable 8000 that is numeric only,
and has 16 memory locations...
  All are working and in service as I type..
