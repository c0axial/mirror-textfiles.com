PCMANAGE,
Sorry to hear that the program isn't quite up to what you need.  When I'd
gotten it, I'd played with it for a bit, then tucked it away.  The concept
is a good one...too bad the execution isn't as great.  Does the search
continue?  :-)

VOICES ON THE INTERNET,ASDF
I have been using a software package on my Sun workstation allowing voice
across the network for some time.  The package is called Radio, and is
part of the standard GNU distribution tape for UNIX.  The program would
take sound from the little microphone connected to my workstation, and
anybody who ran the listening program, would have the sound come out of
the speaker connected to their workstation.
I used this successfully on the company's internal wide area network between
Chicago and London. The delay was mininal.  These machines were only
connected to a standard 10 megabit per second ethernet.  It did not use
very much of the band width either.  Interesting technology.

HP 1200C DESKJET PRINTER,FROG
Ward:

     Have you had a chance to review the specs on the new HP
1200C DeskJet Color printer?  This seems to be what I am looking
to attach to my system.  I was wondering what the largest size
paper this machine is capable of handling.  The 1200C will also come
in a postscript version, which is the model I would be interested in
obtaining.

R/GROUP,
Getting back to your troubles. Check to see if the fax init string contains
&f. I had some strange problems with my fax/modem card until the service tech
told me about resetting the modem to factory settings with the at&f command.

SCSI,
If memorty serves correct, SCSI-III will support more than 8 devices,
32 I believe, but it is still under debate. As far as I know, SCSI-II
still supports 8 devices ( 7, actually, since the host adapter eats up
a slot ).

IDE/LOCAL BUS REVISITED,
Ward,
   I just got a chance to do a little exploring in the VESA/LB world
again.	An identical machine running standard ISA/IDE vs. VESA local
bus card in a couple of benchmarks:  Norton SI	13.6  vs 9.9
PC labs Benchmark 7.0 drive test overall rating of 47777 vs 46244
   Seems to work OK.. you get 3 modes to choose from: NOrmal, enhanced
and TUrbo.  Normal leaves system bios alone, enhanced mode, using a
new BIOS and reloacting it into RAM, and a Turbo mode that does the BIOS
swap , plus attempts multiple read / multiple write commands offered by
some of the newer IDE drives....
   NOw for some of the fun questions:  which drive manufactureres
support this new command?  DO my Seagates(ST3283A)  ??
   ANd when does thjis VESA/LB stop ??	It was for video only, then they had
2 slots.  The most recentr MB's I have seen now offer 3 VESA slots.  Will
we soon have 7 LB slots? And if so, does there come a point where they
start to interfere ( too many)	or until we get to parallel processing
only 1 card is active at a time so it doesn't matter.
	SOmething just seems wrong to be popping all of these cards
directly on the CPU.
