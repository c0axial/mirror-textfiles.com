R/BBS LISTING?,
See # 46113 for a pointer to BBS lists.

R/CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SHOW?,
Yep, the final (fourth) day of CES--Sunday, 6 June--is open to the public
this year. If you need further details (or would like to visit during the
MUCH-less-crowded trade-only days (3-5 June), give me a call. I can be
reached at (312) 939-3300 most weekday afternoons. Unfortunately, I am
lucky to call to the few local BBSes I still follow more than once per
month, so I probably won't see a reply here till after the 6th <smile>.

MICROCOM DIP SWITCHES,
I picked a microcom ZX/2400 external modem and need an outline of
both dipswitch functions,anyone have this or Microcom's address?

R/AN INNOVATION...?,
Another possibility is that when you had two outputs connected together,
one of them was able to sink enough current from the other to alter
internal thresholds in the driver/receiver chip (assuming it was one
chip with both, rather than the old 1488 and 1489).  Maybe the chip
was sourcing enough current into its ground to alter the reference
points (similar to a TTL counter double-counting because the first
count created a current spike).

R/1ST BBS QUESTIONS,
  <Cont'd>
  1. Who am I and what do I do?  Well, I started working for IBM in '68,
and was bitterly disappointed to find the sales offices didn't HAVE
computers!  So I got interested in having my own - early '70s all that was
available of course was minis.	In '74 I heard of micros, and "TTL" chips
for the first time, and spent the summer teaching myself digital electronics.
I built my own selectric typewriter terminal interface, and also an intf.
for a floppy drive, in '75.  Thus when the IBM 8" diskette became standard
years later, I was incompatible due to having gotten in before standards
came about.  SO, I needed a way to share my then-prolific programming
talents, and get other people's programs, and cassettes weren't "cool".
SO, based purely on an ascii ref card that showed words like "ACK", "EOT",
I wrote a program - and indirectly I guess - designed a protocol.  I tried
to get Heath (now Zenith) to come out with a home computer kit in '74, but
they didn't have "the vision", and said "oh, we HAVE a computer - it is
analog".  Similar results from asking IBM to come out with a micro - they
said "We don't see a market for such a device" - in '78 or so.
  I graduated from Milton College with a BA in Physics and Chemistry.
  2. Where'd the BBS idea come from?  Well, Hayes had invented the modem
that you could answer the phone with, (I mean "at hobbyist prices" - there
were commercial auto-answer modems, too).  Micros (they weren't called
PCs yet) were cheap enough to afford to have a 2nd one.
  At our club meetings, we had a cork board and push-pin bulletin board,
with 3x5 cards with things like "Need ride to next meeting", "Lets get
together for a group-purchase of memory chips", "anyone else have a KIM-1?",
etc.  SO, I came up with the idea of "Computerizing" that - making a
"Computerized Bulletin Board System" - CBBS was born.  We publicized it
in the local computer club newsletter, I told folks on Arpanet about it,
and I wrote an article for the November '78 BYTE magazine.
  Hope this does it!

R/1ST BBS QUESTIONS,
Wow! Thanks much for your reply.  I should have known that you of all people
would have verbose fingers...  As it turns out, the space for the article
was cut down, so the section on the history of BBSs was only allowed one
paragraph... so you got stuck in there somewhere between the pony express and
the internet...  I hope to be able to do a more comphrensive story on BBSs
for an upcoming issue (assuming that the mag survives that long).  The mag
will have a booth at the PC Expo in Chicago, perhaps you would be stopping by
the booth -- Computer REGISTER.

Thanks for the reply, I'll hang onto it as valuable material.

R/XMODEM CRC CALCULATION,
Sorry, no, CRC wasn't my doing, I don't have code.  I DO believe a table-
driven CRC in "C" is on one of the low message #'s of the "Ward Board CBBS"
at (708) 849-1132 (2400 baud) - check msg #'s like 4-5-6-7-8 sort of thing
- you can do "s" then "1" then ^K out and try to retrieve the appropriate ones.
