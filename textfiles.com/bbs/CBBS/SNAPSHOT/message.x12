I need information on Pittsburgh BBS numbers.  Anybody know any?

R/PITTSBURGH,
  I think the Computer Shopper has a BBS listing by area - might check one
out when you're in a store to verify if this is still true.

Ward:

     I was reading about a new IBM product called Audio Solution Board.
The board is available in ISA & MCA bus versions.  The board supports
MPC/2 specs w/16bit audio and smplaing rates fo 44.1KHz.  The board also
supports MIDI and external jacks for headphones and speakers, a joystick
port and 4-1 sudio compression.  Sound Blaster compatibility will be
added lster this summer.  Do you or can you get any information on this
IBM product for me.

THE WRITTEN RECORD,
Ward,
	I had the pleasure of stopping in at the new Borders book store
near my home.  Quite a nice selection of computer books and reference
material ( although they were all at cover price)Aodbe Postscript
reference, Microsoft's library of developer books, etc.  Even an
expresso caffe.
	To the point, I found at least one author who did his homework
and gave not only the correct reference for MODEM & XMODEM, but also
the idea, thought, invention and creation of the world's first BBS
system, (even had the name right CBBS).

WEDGE,
Ward, have you received the PX-8 wedge yet?  I'm sorry it took so long
to get it off to you; school started here and between the class I was
teaching and doing childcare at home, it got to be a tad busy...

READING NOVEL 2.X HARD DRIVE,
I have a LITTLE problem.  Without getting into a lot of detail, I need
to be able to directly read the contents of a Novell ELS 2.15 level II
hard drive with something similiar to Nortons.
    My memory recalls that the boot track contains a boot loader, and
that the entire drive shows up as a non-dos unit and CAN NOT be accessed
via DOS or any DOS utility.
   Anyway around the non-dos problem?  Any other way to accomplish the
same feat?  I need to be able to search for a character string on the
drive.
're in a store to verify if this is still true.
