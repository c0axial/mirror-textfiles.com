R/VOICE BOARDS,
I am interested in voice mail for a business reason. I wouldn't invest in
one for personal use.

R/VOICE MAIL,
Were these junk mail ads or did they appear in a perodical?

R/WRITE MESSAGES,
  The problem that I have has been the first two or three characters
of each line are missing when I list the contents of the message just
after sending it up.  I will try a greater pause between characters
the next time I try to send up a message.  Thanx for your help.

R/PS,
  Whoa, why never connect the Geneva to a DOS machine?	Something really
strange about it?  Like no serial port?  Heh.

R/MEMORY PRICES UP 53%,
  I haven't heard more, but I guess it is a simple matter of greed - if the
prices are going to go up LATER, "might as well raise 'em now" - for one
thing, it will make the supply last longer!  Heh.

KODAK CD'S,
In your message you did not specify what CD rom you are using.	Is it
compatable with Kodak CD technology?  Older CD drives are NOT.

R/KODAK PHOTO CD,
Ward, I found a good program on COMPUSERVE called GWSWIN.ZIP. It is a
shareware program with low registration fee. Seems to work OK. I can't
provide a qualitative eval as I don't really know much about this area.
It showed me all of the photos on the CD and allowed me to crop them,
save them, and convert them into other formats (PCD to GIF, for example)
with no hassle. As one might guess from the name, it's a Windows prog,
and it runs great in WINOS2 under OS2 2.1. I'll check out KODAK, too.
Thanks for the info.

WINDOWS NT/ NT SERVER,
Has anyone worked with NT in any depth.  AS I have been reading the
reviews more closely, it seems that maybe it was a biger 'leap' in
technology then people are ready to accept on their desktop.
What about compatability?  I know it supports, DOS, WIndows, OS/2 file
structure ( I don't know about runnning OS/2 in an NT window.. that would
be neat) Mac file services, and multiple protocols easily.
   If you are using it, where and why???   Is it ready to replace the
traditional Novell file server in today's office??

R/GOOD CONNECTION,
u're quite right, sometimes i can see the whole message full of quotes and j
just a few actual lines. that ain't writing a msg is all about right!?
it's right, the first BBS in the world should keep on running. it can act
as your computer answering machine. i'm trying to set up a msg based bbs here
alot off bbs in my country carry files and some echos. well, i just want to
make minne sort of like an answering machine.
