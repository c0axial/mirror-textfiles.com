TANDY PRINTERS QUESTION,
	Hello!	I got a Tandy DMP-202 dot matrix printer, it emulates
IBM proprinter X24, but on all printouts it feeds out 1 extra inch of
paper, which is very inconvenient.  Someone said, that all Tandy
printers do that, but there is not a word about it in the manual.
Does anyone know if it is possible to turn off this feature, or is
this set forever and ever.
Thanx,	  Boris.

R/PS/2 PARTS FOR SALE,
Ward:

    I wish that I did get in to upload but I couldn't get it to work
yet.  I did it the hard way character by character.  Thankx for the promo
I have had some replys to my offers.  One reply was the guy was going to
buy most of the equipment that I had for the PS/2.  I am waiting for him
to come back and say yeas or no.  I will just keep on trying to sell the
equipment.

GENEVA,
Well, I _think_ I have the BASIC ROM lying around still.  The Geneva
is also known as the PX-8, and was a direct descendent of the HX-20.

I _do_ have a custom ROM for it with VDE and a couple of neat little
utilities.  I chucked the modem wedge when I moved, I think (I'll have
to look).

Anyhow, if you're serious, let me know.  $40, shipping included, and
I'll even throw in a tape for the drive (if you have HX-20 tapes (I
THINK that machine had a cassette) they'll likely be readable on
this little machine).

R/GENEVA,
  Sure, what the heck - a little bit of history.  Heck, I'll put CBBS on
it.  What's the capacity?  (heh, just kidding).  ACTUALLY, I thought of
putting CBBS on one of those $99 surplus Zenith laptops.
  Give me your addr when you do the g command.

486 FOR SALE,
  Thanks for the offer, I'm holding a 486/33 with 2-serial, parallel,
IDE, here in my hand.  CBBS runs on some old piece of dung, which is about
5 times faster than needed already - remember, this is assembler, written
to run on a 2mhz 8080!
  SO appreciate the offer.  Go ahead and put up an ad (though this is a lightly
used board, won't get much response).
  Be SURE to turn off CAPS LOCK, looks like you were, as we say, "SHOUTING"
when have have all caps on.  Heh.

SCSI I & II ETC,
   Anyone really understand SCSI?  Or know a good article on it?
   Randy sez that SCSI is sort of async - that's how it can transfer
tape, CDs, hard disk, etc.  So the drive determines the speed of xfer,
but there are "fast" SCSI drives, do you need "fast" SCSI adapters, too?
Or is there some kind of negotiation between the drive and controller?
   I noticed IBM's new 540M and 1G drives are fast scsi, but that they work
on old PS/2's, but for AT bus they need the new fast controller.  (this is
strictly IBM, no talk of Adaptec, etc).

XMODEM SOFTWARE FOR VAX,
we are looking for file transfer software that uses the
xmodem protocol to run on a digital vax using vms
ndent of the HX-20.

I _do_ have a custom ROM for it with
