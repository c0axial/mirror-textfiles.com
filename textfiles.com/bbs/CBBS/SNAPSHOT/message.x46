BULLETINS,NONE
You should know by now that NOBODY reads the bulletins on ANY system.
That doesn't mean they shouldn't be there.  And you SHOULD put a
privacy notice in the opening bulletin to obtain full protection
of the Communications Privacy Act.

VOICE MAIL,
I am interested in voice mail boards for the PC. I would be grateful for any
information anybody is willing to share. This is one of the many subjects I
must admit to being quite ignorant.

FAN CLUB,
Well, I'm sort of used to the fan noise now, but it still bothers
me a little.  My old Kaypro was such a silent sucker!  I've been
thinking about putting in a switch -- check for hot spots, then if
I find any, fan on.  I don't know.  I DO know my temperature sensitivity
is pretty good (anyone with two small children needs to be able to pick
up  +/- 2 degrees or so)!

IF I try this when I get back home, I'll let you know the results...

MOVIES & COMPUTERS,
Computer Boxes- should have read software boxes, that fancy packaging
for software that users throw out, but computer stores require if you
want them to sell your product. <g>

The negatives are printed from a MAC on an image setter. It's a postScript
device. It does true 2400 dpi over it's entire printable area. Better than
8 bit color, don't know if it's 16 or 24 bit. These things are very ex
expensive, but fairly common.

X.25=MULTI LINES?,
   One of the biggest surprises I recall at ONE BBSCON, was learning that
folks running multi-line BBSs didn't have to have a phone line to their
house for each line!  Instead, they had a single say 56K x.25 line, which
multiplexed multiple calls!  I thought that was cool.
   But now that I'm back home and thinking about it (I don't mean "thinking
about DOING it", just thinking about it conceptually) I realize: or more
correctly, a friend asked: where are the modems?  GOOD QUESTION!
   If you have x.25, but the people calling you DO NOT, then does the phone
company have a rack of modems, turn the signals back into digital, then
digitally multiplex them down the line to your house?
   Thanks for any ideas!

RECHARGABLE ALKALINES,
From the little I have read about them, they are new, specially designed
or formulated battries.  You have to get the batteries and the special
recharger. While only assuming, if it were a special circuit in the
charger alone, they would market it to the world for use with standard
alkaline battries.
