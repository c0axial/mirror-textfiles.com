][REPLY=How to reply to existing message
The command REPLY will allow you to reply to an existing message.  You mustç
know its number.  Alternatively, when retrieving individual message numbersç
(i.e. CBBS is asking you "msg # to retrieve or (RE)ply, C/R to end"), you canç
say RE (or REPLY), and CBBS will create a reply to the last retrievedç
message.  
  NOTE: One good technique is to use the '.' (retrieve next message) as youç
can then RE to reply to an appropriate message.  Sorry, there is no way toç
"get back" to the msg # you were reading before you replied.
][FIND=Command to find a users last call
(SEE keyword: SEARCH for information on finding messages)

  find firstname lastname

is used to ask: "does so-and-so use the system", or "when did so-and-so lastç
call in - might they have seen my msg?", etc. Just type
	FIND firstname lastname
and if it can find that person, it will show a line like:
 Last call: 12/17/84 @01:11 #02032
NOTE that:
 1. Unlike other CBBS commands, there are no ";" between parts of theç
command.
 2. It must exactly match - not abbreviations, * or ?, etc.  This is becauseç
the USER file is HASHED, or RANDOMIZED using the exact spelling of the name,ç
to find a "slot" to drop the user into.  Thus the exact spelling is needed.
][MINE=Info on "MINE" command.
The command "mine" executes the following search, where ffffff is your firstç
name, and llll is the first 4 chars of your last name:
  "or;1,t=ffffff llll,t=ffff/,t=ffff  "
The first searches for your full first name and the first 4 letters of yourç
last; the second search searches for your first name followed immediately byç
a /, as in "WARD/ALL"; the third searches for your first name only.  The twoç
spaces following the first search ensure it matches ONLY when the first nameç
is alone at the end of the line.
  Note that the message numbers (up to the first 9) will be stored inç
"variables" #1 thru #9.  Thus if there were 3 messages found by "mine", youç
can go back to re-retrieve the first by "r;#1", the second by "R;#2", etc. ç
If you reply to the second, you can kill it via "k;#2".  Further attempts toç
R or K #2 will come up "not found".  BE CAREFUL: the next summary/retrieveç
command (OR, QR, or SR) will BLANK, then REPLACE these - so typing K;#2 MIGHTç
attempt to kill a msg that wasn't from "mine".
  Note that "MINE" does not find msgs FROM you.  Do: s;1,your name
to find all msgs to/from/about you, since that will match your name in ANYç
field (from, to, even subject).  "Policing" for obsolete messages of yoursç
will help the operator maintain CBBS and is greatly appreciated!
][STAT=Determines disk storage
Of significance only when the M command is enabled, STAT is used when usingç
the M command to receive a file, and you want to be sure there is room forç
it.  If you have not executed the M command and entered the password, STATç
shows the room left on the CBBS disk, which may or may not be the same as theç
modemming disk.
][CPM=
[CP/M=CBBS doesn't allow access to CP/M
This is only a message system, with file transfer via "M" command using pre-arranged passwords.  Dir (via D subcommand of M) and STAT (via STAT while inç
M) are available, as is type (via T subcommand of M).
][PARITY=CBBS does not set or test parity.
CBBS sends 8 data bits, i.e. the parity = 0.
][COMMANDS=Help with CBBS commands
[MAIN=CBBS main function menu
[INFO=
Typing a question mark when CBBS is asking for a command, will give you theç
menu of supported commands.  Use this "H" (keyword help) command for detailsç
about any specific command letter.

When in message entry (E command), a separate menu will be presented.
][USER=CBBS REMEMBERING ITS USERS
When you sign on, CBBS looks up your name in a 512-name table.  Itç
"randomizes" you name to a particular record, and scans 20 records to see ifç
it finds your name.  If it doesn't, then it REPLACES the oldest record amongç
those 20.  The next time you call in, CBBS will have remembered the date,ç
time, and high message number as of your last call.  See also keyword "*" andç
"U".
][*=PREVIOUS HIGH MSG #.
If you have logged into CBBS previously and thus had your user statisticsç
recorded, CBBS will remember the high message number on your previous call inç
a "variable" called "*".  Thus S;* or R;*;+ may be used to reference theç
previous high message.  The "#" command also shows the high message number.
][U=User command.
The U command records the settings of the following commands:
  e(X)pert user mode
  (P)rompt bell on/off
  (D)uplex (echo/ho echo)
  (C)ase (upper/lower)
  SHORT (duplicate spaces sent to you or not).

Just set these as you'd line, and execute the U command.  The next time youç
call in, they will automatically be set for you, as long as your name hasn'tç
been overlaid by a more recent caller (512 names in file)
][NULL=what is a null
A null is a character with a value of 0, sent just to pass time, for
terminals that need time after a carriage movement operation.  The "N"
command is how you set them.  They were originally used for slow tele-typewriters, but are again often necessary due to slow-scrolling memoryç
mapped video boards.
  When first signing on, press ^N while CBBS types to you, to get 5 nulls.
][SLOW=CBBS typing to you slowly?
If you have inadvertently pressed several N or ^N keys while CBBS is typingç
to you, you may be receiving an excessive number of nulls (time-wasters) atç
the start of each line.  Use the N command, and set the exact number of nullsç
you need (usually 0).  Intentionally, CBBS increments the number of nullsç
sent by 5 for each N or ^N you send while it is typing to you.
][GAMES=NO Games on CBBS!
A very few people, ask CBBS to get games.  No.  Why:
1. Playing games is fun, yes.
2. However, consider the benefits
   * To the player: yes
   * To CBBS: none.
   * To other callers: none.
3. CBBS is a message system for sharing creative ideas among
   hams, microcomputerists, and electronics experimenters.  It
   best serves that need by remaining a pure message system.
][-=use of "-"
R;- retrieves the previous 10 messages.
s;-nn retrieves the summaries "nn" msgs back from the highest.
][LINEFEEDS=CBBS always sends linefeeds
If your terminal is double-spacing everything you see from CBBS, you mightç
have some kind of "auto linefeed" switch set on on your terminal.  Also someç
very early versions of TRS-80 software didn't handle linefeeds
properly, causing "double spacing" when talking to a system sending
standard CR/LF lines.
][SALE=
[SELL=How to sell something via CBBS; Do we sell CBBS?
We welcome "for sale" messages on CBBS, for items related to computer
hobbying, ham radio, and electronic experimenting.
 * Simply use "E" to enter the message
 * Put "for sale" as well as W-H-A-T you are selling, IN the
   subject, so that the "Q" and "S" summary commands show WHAT
   is for sale, ex:
   "apple modem for sale" or "2716's for sale".
---
To search for items for sale, type: s;1,sale
---
CBBS is no longer sold, sorry.  The time and effort necessary to document,ç
package, and make it available on a variety of formats got to be too much!
][CBBS=What is CBBS
[OVERVIEW=Overview of CBBS
Keywords "CBBS", "OVERVIEW":
CBBS, the Computerized Bulletin Board System, was conceived in January,
1978, by Ward Christensen and Randy Suess, for communicating messages
between computer hobbyists (HAMS, electronics experimenters, etc).

Many people suggest ADDING a phone line, but while that is easy, CBBS is
written as a single user system, running under a single user operating
system, so the software changes would be "enormous".  ..Maybe someday.
][SHORT=Shorten CBBS output by suppressing some characters
[LONG=Un-do what what was done by SHORT command:
The SHORT command causes certain duplicate characters to not be sent.  Theç
characters are: space, and !"#$%&'()*+,-./ (Ascii 20-2F hex). This saves timeç
on long distance calls, and generally, makes CBBS usage more
efficient, and only a little bit less readable.

To un-do the SHORT command, type SHORT a second time.
][NEXT=What will the next message number be
[#=What does the # command do
# tells you next caller #, next msg #, and # of active msgs.

If you have flagged any messages in any of the summary commands, # will
also show the designated message numbers.  See keyword: MARK.
][MARK=Info on marked msgs
When you flag messages during a summary, or in expert user mode use one ofç
the auto-retrieve summary scans (QR, OR, SR), the first 9 msgs set forç
retrieval will be remembered.  #1 will refer to the first, thru #9 which isç
the last.  You can then use #5 as the message number in a retrieve or killç
command.

][NEW=How does new user get help (or "what's new"?)
Type HELP from the main menu, rather than just "H".

To find out "what's new" use the "NEWS" command.
][MAIL=Sorry, there are no "mailboxes" on CBBS.
Some people ask if there are, but not at this time.  To leave "mail" forç
someone, just leave them a message with the the "E" command.  All messagesç
are PUBLIC.  To leave "private mail" for the system operator, enter commentsç
when you leave via the "Good bye command" (letter G).
][FUNCTIONS=Misc. details about CBBS functions
R: When you retrieve a msg, you must know its number.
S: (and O and Q) can search message summaries for keywords.
   The most simple form is: S;1,xxxx   where xxxx are any chars.
G: The Good-bye function allows you to leave comments.
X: Works at any time.  For example, if you are in
   message entry, and need more details, type  X   then return.
][HELP="New user" help function
[H=Keyword-oriented help
The "H" command, executed from the main menu, which is what you are doingç
right now, is the main way CBBS gives you assistance in its functions.

Randy suggested, however, that new users don't necessarily "find" the "H"ç
command, and type "HELP" even though we don't say that is available.  So, inç
7/81, "HELP" was added.  It checks for the more commonly asked problems onç
CBBS.

Feel free to try either of them - you can easily abort them.
][CTL CHRS=Help with system control characters.
To correct keying mistakes, you use:

DEL/RUBOUT for character delete on non-video terminals,
Control-H (or backspace) for char delete on a video terminal
Control-R to reshow a corrected line
Control-U to delete a line
Control-W to video-backspace a word
Control-X to video-backspace a line
Control-L to see how long an input field is

To control CBBS while it types to you, you use:

Ascii, or control characters: C, K, N, and S

C or control-C cancels what is being sent.  Output resumes at the next
information typed, or the next question.  Use it when you know what the
system is going to say/ask, or otherwise don't want to see more of what isç
being typed.

K or control-K kills the current function.  It returns you to the functionç
select menu.  It may be typed alone as the first character on a line in inputç
mode.  If allowed, it will echo as: ^K  and you must press return to have itç
take effect.  If you get a ^K when you don't want it, cancel it with aç
control-U.

K or control-K while in message entry returns you to the message entry
menu.  CAUTION:  Older CBBS's returned you to the main menu no matter whereç
you were.

Each N or Control-N adds 5 to the number of nulls CBBS sends.

S or control-S suspends output until some other character is typed.   Useç
this if you have a video display, and want a see something before it scrollsç
off the top of the screen.
][^C=Cancel CBBS output
While CBBS is typing something to you, pressing "C" or Control-C skips
sending to you until the next input, or until the next "piece" of output
(next summary, message, header, etc)
][^E=Send carriage return/Linefeed to your terminal.
Each time you press control-E, CBBS will send a CR-LF to you. It has no
other action to CBBS.
][^H=Backspace to correct typing errors.
Each control-H (or backspace) you send to CBBS deletes another character
from what you had previously typed.  It then echoes a
backspace-space-backspace to you, to erase the character. If ^H is not
convenient for you to type, but you want video backspaces, use the "V"
command to assign a new key (such as "\" for your video backspace.
][^K=Kill out of current function.
Pressing "K" or Control-K while CBBS types to you, will usually kill-out ofç
what you are doing, and go back to the main menu.  Exceptions: In messageç
entry, ^K returns to the message entry sub-menu; During Q, O, or S summary,ç
if you have flagged and messages, ^K starts retrieving the flagged messages; ç
^K a second time to stop the auto-retrieve.
][^N=Send 5 more NULLS.
If your terminal or printer needs extra time after CBBS sends each Linefeed,ç
each control-N you type adds 5 nulls. Use the "N" command to pick the exactç
number that works best for you.
][^R=Re-show line.
If you have made changes to a line (by backspacing, or on non-videoç
terminals, by pressing DEL (or RUBOUT), control-R sends CR/LF then echoesç
back the line to you as CBBS sees it.
][^S=Suspend output from CBBS
Pressing S or Control-S, stops CBBS from sending to you. Press another S toç
start back up.  Other keys, such as C/R or Q or control-Q will also work. ç
Pressing another key which CBBS understands, such as C or K, will take thatç
key's appropriate action.
][^W=Word backspace.
When keying in, pressing Control-W will cause CBBS to back up over the lastç
word you keyed in.  For simplicity, words are delimited by either a space, orç
a ";".  If it backs up too far, you can press ^C while it is still backingç
up, to have it stop backing up.  If you type a line (such as in a message)ç
that you realize is too long, you can ^W to back up to make the line shortç
enough to avoid the truncation message CBBS prints.
][^X=Line backspace.
After keying in a line, pressing control-X will cause CBBS to  backspace-outç
the line.  While it is backing up, ^C stops it backing up, and leaves theç
line containing what you see.
][^L=Find how long an input field is.
Often you want to take advantage of the maximum length of input fields,
particularly when entering a message and specifying "WHO TO" and "SUBJECT". ç
Typing ^L will CR/LF, then type a line of _____ letting you know exactly howç
long the input field is.  You can type this control character after partiallyç
answering - it will print the "___" line, then fill it in with what you haveç
typed.  Example:

Subject:?	At this time, you type "1200 baud modem for sale", press
^L and get:
1200 baud modem for sale______

CBBS then leaves you positioned after the word SALE, showing you have 6 moreç
characters you could have keyed in.

^L acts like ^R, except that it prints the line of "___" first.
][HEADLINES=
[NEWS=The CBBS NEWS function
NEWS is a simple function of CBBS, intended as an extension of the bulletin -ç
to keep the bulletin (relatively) small. NEWS asks if you want (H)eadlines,ç
or (D)etails.  NEWS will contain the latest changes on CBBS usage tips,ç
hints, etc. The latest news will always be first.  Typing K will kill theç
NEWS function, and return you to the main menu.  The best way to access newsç
is with the detail option, using C (or ^C) to skip the details you don't wantç
to see, and K (or ^K) to kill out of it completely.
][C=Case change command (upper/lower).
[CASE=changing CBBS between Upper-only, and upper-lower case.
The C command changes CBBS between upper-case-only mode, and upper-lowerç
mode.  CBBS also senses your case when you reply to the "Y/N is this yourç
first time...".  If you reply with a lower case "y" or "n", CBBS will flipç
from the default upper-case-only mode, into lower-upper mode.  If you enterç
"Y" or "N", (i.e. upper case) CBBS stays in upper case mode.  If you (E)nterç
a message, CBBS will ask if you can handle lower case (because messages inç
lower case look nicer). This will only be asked once.
][ESUB=Edit function subcommands.
Once you have keyed in your message (or part of it) here are the
subcommands of (E)nter you may use:

- (A)bort: discards your message, returns to main function menu.
- (C)ontinue input.  If room, continues inputting at msg end.
- (D)elete a line: You specify the line number.  Following lines are movedç
back to fill up the space.
- (E)dit a line: allows a character-string-substitution type edit to beç
performed on a particular line. (Example:
	/moem/modem/   to correct a misspelled word.
- (G)et previous msg: allows you to fill the edit buffer with the contents ofç
a previous message, then edit it.  Particularly useful for updating "forç
sale" msgs, deleting items sold, changing prices, etc.
- (H)elp types a help file allowing you to get details on any of theç
subcommands
- (I)nsert a line: You will be asked for a line number, then to key in a newç
line, which will be inserted BEFORE the specified line #.
- (L)ist allows listing from a starting line #.  The entire message from thatç
line is listed, unless you press K or control-K to skip back to the Enterç
subcommand menu.
- (R)etype allows entirely retyping any line, use it when (E)dit would be tooç
tedious.
- (S)ave saves your message on disk, and returns to the main function menu.
][EDIT=Editing a message
To edit a message you have already saved, use "E" as though you were going
to enter the message again.  But then, instead of typing any lines, press
return, and in the enter sub-function menu, use "G" to get the previous
message. (You must know its number).  The (H)elp subcommand of message
entry will help you with getting a previous message, and editing it or whatç
you have just keyed in.
][LEAVE=see "E" to leave a msg, "G" to leave the system
E means to enter a message.
G means to say "good bye".
][OFF=Signing off of CBBS - use G command (Good bye)

][PASSWORD=Help with protecting messages with password.
When you enter your message, you will be asked for a password.  If you justç
press return, no password is assigned, and anyone can kill it, althoughç
presumably the person you sent it to will.  To protect the message, chooseç
any 4-characters as the password.  Then only you, or someone knowing yourç
password, or the system operators, can kill it.
][KILL=
[DELETE=
[ERASE=Help on killing (Erasing) messages. (Use K function)
[K=Kill function

To kill (erase) a message from you to you, you use the "K" function.  You'llç
be prompted for the message number.  If the message is found and is killable,ç
it's summary will be typed for verification that you entered the correctç
number.  If it was saved with a password, you'll be asked for it.
][SUMMARY=Help with system summary function.
[O=One-line Summary command
[S=Summary command
[Q=Quick summary command
[SR=Summary command with auto retrieve
[QR=Quick summary command with auto retrieve
[QUICK=Help with system summary functions.

The (S)ummary function prints 2 lines for each message in the system, from aç
given starting message number.  Use ctl-K to abort the summary listing.  Theç
Summary prints:

 Message number
 # of lines in message
 Date Created
 From
 To
 Subject

The (O)ne line summary squeezes this all on one line, omitting the # lines.

The (Q)uick summary function prints only msg # and subject.

You will be asked for the starting message number, (you need not enter
leading zeros).   Alternatively, you may enter a number of the form -n,
where n is number representing 'the last n messages'. For example q;-15
would start the scan from the 15th most recent message.  (or, you could
type Q, then press return, and when asked for the starting message #, replyç
with -15).  ";" is used to separate "anticipated" answers.

See help keyword "SEARCH" for info on searching messages.
See help keyword "FLAG" for flagging msgs for retrieval while the Q or S
summary is running.

Use OR, QR or SR to summarize AND retrieve the messages.  Example:
or;1,modem

][SEARCH=Help with searching summaries for content.
[SCAN=Scan messages for content

The "S" (summary) and "Q" (quick summary) commands allow you to search theç
summary for specific keywords.

When asked for the starting message number, type ? to get help on how to
search.

Most simply, to search, enter the starting message number (usually 1), a
comma, then a keyword to search for.

Use as short a keyword as possible which will still be unique.  Being tooç
specific might miss some messages.

Use help keyword "BOOLEAN" for info on using "and", "or", and "not" as wellç
as field specifications, while searching.
][BOOLEAN=Doing "and", "or" and "not" while searching.
[AND=using "and" to search messages
[OR=using "or" to search messages
(( IF you were looking for "OR" as "One line summary with Retrieve, use
   keyword "SR" ))

The S and Q commands allow a search string, after you type the starting
message number (then a comma).  Example:

	s;1,cp/m

You can specify fields, such as "F=WARD" which means "From Ward", etc.

For full details, use the S command, but when asked for a starting messageç
number, type a question mark:  ?
][FLAG=Flag msgs for retrieval while summary types
[F=Press "F" during summary to flag for retrieval

While the "Q" (quick) or "S" (Summary) is typing, you can ask that a
message be flagged for automatic retrieval. Just press your "F" key, duringç
the N-E-X-T summary. (That gives you time enough to see the complete summaryç
of the message you might want to flag).

To flag the last summary, press F while CBBS types the line
"------END OF SUMMARY------"

NOTE: When at > 300 baud, or with the "Q"uick summary, you might not haveç
enough time to decide to flag a msg. In that case, pressing "M" (or Return,ç
which is actually control-M), will have CBBS ask for the msg #.  You may typeç
a single number, or multiple numbers, separated by ";".

The QR and SR commands automatically flag ALL selected messages for
retrieval.

][END=
[EXIT=
[QUIT=Want to "quit" out of CBBS?
[GOODBYE=How to sign-off the system.
[G=The GOODBYE function.
[BYE=Leaving CBBS.
[COMMENTS=Leaving comments about CBBS without entering a msg.
[/=Quick good bye command

Typing G when asked for the function, will get you off the system.  It will ç
give you a chance to leave comments about the system, just by keying linesç
in. (no editing, etc).

The / command may be used for a quicker hang up.  It doesn't ask if you wantç
to leave comments; it also doesn't print the "chars keyed by you..." line.
][NULLS=Help with system sending nulls.
[N=The Nulls function.

Certain terminals require nulls to be sent to them following a carriage
return/line feed, for instance the T.I. Silent 700 series.  The 'N'
function is used to set the number of nulls, to any value from 0 to 255.

However, if you need nulls, you would want to get them from the beginning. ç
While the system is typing, hitting ^N will cause the system to send 5 nullsç
after each linefeed.  Each time CBBS sees you press a ^N,  it adds 5 to theç
number of nulls being sent.  Use the "N" command to set exactly how many youç
need (experiment with it).
][PHONE=
[BULLETIN=Help with retrieving Bulletin and Welcome messages.
[B=Bulletin reprint function.
[WELCOME=Help with retrieving Bulletin and Welcome messages.
[W=Welcome reprint function.

When you first got onto the system, the system typed a "Welcome" message.  Itç
included some useful information such as a brief summary of the controlç
characters accepted by this system.  Then, if there were any bulletins, theyç
printed.

If you missed either (used "C" or control-C) or just want to see them
again, function 'W' will retype the welcome message, and function 'B' willç
retype the bulletin.

The bulletin contains the operator(s) voice phone numbers.
][DUPLEX=Help with system character echoing features.
[D=The Duplex (Echo) function.
[ECHO=Help with system character echoing features.
[DOUBLE=Is your terminal typing every character twice?

The D (for Duplex) function switches the system between Full Duplex (whichç
echoes what you type) and Half Duplex (which doesn't echo what you type)ç
mode.  Some teletypes and other devices print immediately when you press aç
key, so you don't want the system to echo characters back to you. Use the Dç
function to switch to or from this mode.
][BELL=Help with system Prompt (bell on/off) function.
[PROMPT=Help with system Prompt (bell on/off) function.
[P=The prompt (bell) function

Every time the system wants you to type something, it sends you a questionç
mark, then a bell character.  The P function may be used to stop the sendingç
of the bell prompt.  Using P flip/flops this function (bell on, bell off,ç
etc). The bell ALWAYS rings in column 75 to warn you of the 78 char lineç
length limit for inputting messages.
][EXPERT=Help with eXpert users mode.
[X=The expert mode function

The X function puts you into expert user mode.  It shortens all prompts,
and deletes some lines such as the headers in the summary print.  Use it toç
save time after you have become familiar with the system.

As of CBBS 3.5, "X" works at any time - if a prompt is too "cryptic"
because of being in expert mode, just type X then press return.  The longerç
prompt will then be given.
][USE=Help with using system efficiently.

1) Minimize connect time: only 1 phone into system.
2) Press "C" to cancel typing if you know what is being typed or don't wantç
to see more.
3) Use message summary retrieval to see what messages you want to see.  Forç
example, use s;-50 to see the last 50 summaries.
4) If you plan on leaving a message, have it well thought out to minimize theç
'compose' time while you are on the system.
5) Once you learn the questions being asked, answer multiple questions inç
advance by separating your answers with a semicolon
	(for example: s;1  or r;23;24;25).
][TIME=Description of system Time function.
[T=The Time function.

Typing 'T' will return the current date, time and total elapsed time that youç
have been on the system.  This information is also written to the system Logç
file.
][VIDEO=Help with video backspace function.
[BACKSPACE=Help with video backspace function.
[V=Video backspace mode function.
If you are on a video terminal which can backspace, use your backspace key toç
correct a character.  (Backspace is ctl-H)

(If you want video backspaces echoed to you, but you want to press a key
other than ^H, use the "V" command to select an additional backspace
character, such as "\" or DEL/Rubout.)

If you are on a non-backspacing terminal, use DEL (sometimes labeled
RUBOUT) to delete a character.

On video terminals, you can also use ^W for word delete, and ^X for line
delete.  You can even ^C out of them (!!) (i.e. as it is backing up, ^C toç
stop it), if you realize you have gone too far.  (a nit, but neat!)
][TAB=Use of control-I (TAB) characters.

When entering messages, you may now utilize the control-I or tab key.  Thisç
will allow you to format your messages without adding too much space to ourç
files. The tab key spaces over to the next tab field which is 8 charactersç
wide.
][HARDWARE=What hardware makes up the system.
The "Ward Board" CBBS runs on an 18-slot Vectaor 1+ mainframe, with: 2ç
Shugart 801 floppy disk drives (600K each); Old ACE Keyboard; Californiaç
Computer Systems 4MHz Z-80; Memory Merchants 64K memory;  Tarbell doubleç
density floppy disk controller;  PMMI modem to reset upon ring; Hayesç
Smartmodem 2400 for comm, hooked to N* HSIO4 board; Imsai VIO 80 x 24 memoryç
mapped video display; MITS Parallel & Serial boards; Scitronics clock board.ç
A kludge board resets and boots the system upon phone ring.  Boot transfersç
to CBBS via CP/M auto-command.
][FILES=Some information about CBBS file usage

 >> This item has 80+ lines.  Press K to kill typing <<


CBBS is a 20K 8080 machine language program running under CP/M.  It is
entirely self-contained.
  CBBS uses many files on disk.  They are:

	CBBS.COM
The CP/M command file: the machine language CBBS program.
	NEXT	
Contains the next caller #, msg #, and # of active messages. If there is aç
">> FLASH <<" it also comes from this file.
	SUMMARY
This is a file with the 2-line summary for each message. The format of theç
file is:
^Gnnnnn,ll,mm/dd/yy,who from,who to,
subject,password
  where nnnnn is the message #, ll the # of lines.
The password is the one the user asked for when entering the message.  A
special password is used to prevent some messages from being erased.
	MESSAGE.Xnn
There are from 1 to 50 message files.  Small CBBS systems might have as fewç
as 1 (or more practically, say, 10). A "full blown" CBBS has 50 messageç
files.   NOTE:  Typically, CBBS.COM, NEXT, SUMMARY, and all MESSAGES are onç
one disk.  The following files are typically on another disk:

	BULLETIN
Contains exactly what you see when you log on, or use "B"
	ENTINTRO
The file typed when you go into "E" message entry, and want some help
	ENTRHELP
The help file which is interpreted when you use the "H" sub-command of
message entry.
	FIRSTIME
When you say "Y" to "Y/N is this your first time..." this is the help fileç
which is interpreted
	FUNCTION
Contains a list of supported functions.
	HELP
Contains a list of keywords, and their explanations. The "H" or "HELP"
command accesses it.
	NEWS
A file of most-recent-at-the-top news items.  Each has a 1-line headline. ç
The NEWS command accesses it.
	SCANHELP
When you use "S" or "Q", and ask for help on searching messages, this is
the help file which is used.
	WELCOME
Contains the welcome message typed when you log on, or ask for the "W"
command.
	LOG
Contains a log of the date, time, caller number, baud rate, name, and
elapsed time, for each call.  Also contains notes about attempts to kill
protected messages, and comments (entered at the "G" command).
	KILLED
Contains the entirety of every message killed.  Allows us to review
messages which were entered, seen, and killed without our having seen it. ç
Also allows the "RESTORE" command to easily restore any erroneously killedç
message.
	----
NOTE: HELP files such as ENTRHELP or SCANHELP have a special format:  A
line starting with a special character is interpreted as a question.  It isç
typed.  If the answer is "Y", then the information in the following lines upç
to the next special character, are typed.  If "N" is answered, the lines upç
to the next special character are skipped.  The HELP file is similar, exceptç
that the special character lines have the format (specialç
char)KEYWORD=description, and there may be synonyms for each, such as:
	>SUMMARY=Help with system summary function.
	>S=Summary command
	>QUICK=Help with system summary functions.
	>Q=Quick summary command
blah blah this is the details about Q and S blah blah

Hope you found this interesting and informative.
][SOFTWARE=What software drives CBBS.
CBBS is a 20K+ 8080 machine language program written by Ward Christensen, andç
running under the popular 8080/Z-80 CP/M operating system.  In source form,ç
CBBS is a 10000+ line 8080 assembler program.  It is single user.

Information on CBBS (ordering, pre-reqs, etc) WERE in msgs 9-11, 
no longer available

The ideas for CBBS came from Ward, Randy, and Y-O-U, through your comments.

][ENTER=Help with entering a message into system.
[MESSAGE=How to enter one (see "R" for how to retrieve)
[E=Message entry function
[INPUT=How to input a message to CBBS
The E (Enter) function is used to enter messages into the system.  A messageç
is any information to be conveyed to 1 or more people.  You may leaveç
messages for a specific person or group, or "ALL".  It consists of up to 20ç
lines, each line up to 78 characters.  Since this is the CP/M Users Groupç
CBBS, the message should directly relate to CP/M.  Other messages will beç
deleted.
  You may assign a password to be able to erase your own messages.  Using theç
Enter function, you key in your message just as if you were simply typing itç
at a typewriter.  The system will put line numbers at the front of each lineç
(like a BASIC program).  After the message has been keyed in, you can editç
it, list it, save it, or abort.  See help keyword "ESUB" for the enterç
function subcommands.  You can also base your message on a previous one,ç
getting that msg, and editing it.  See ESUB.
][OPERATOR=
[OPERATORS=Who runs this CBBS.
Ward Christensen programmed, put up, and maintains this system.

----------------   CUSTOM STUFF - SYSTEM DEPENDENT ----------------
[M=
[MODEM=How to modem transfer programs on CBBS.
[TYPE=Typing files on CBBS
>>>> Modemming currently disabled (was little used, somewhat abused) <<<<

The "M" command from the main menu gets you into the modem transfer mode. Aç
password will usually be required, which may be arranged for in advance forç
special purposes.  Most likely there will also be a "public" passwordç
allowing access to a shared area of disk for general use.  The commandsç
within the (M)odem sub-command are:
 (D)irectory listing
 (U)ser command may let you access additional disk areas.
 (T)ype command
 (S)end a file to you
 (R)eceive a file from you
Commands may be stacked like everywhere in CBBS, using ";": 
d;*.* or s;sample.txt or u;0;d;*.*;u;1;d;*.*

See also keyword: DOWNLOAD.
][RETRIEVE=Help with retrieving messages.
[READ=read a message
[R=The retrieve function.

"R", the retrieve (Read) function is used to retrieve approved messages fromç
the system.  Use "*" to retrieve the first NEW msg since your last call. orç
enter the message number, which you can find using the summary functions (Q,ç
O, or S).  The message must have been approved by an operator or assistantç
operator to be readable.  You will stay in "retrieve mode" until you pressç
return to go back to the function menu. 

NOTE:  When asked for a message number:

	. means the next msg	+ means the next 10 msgs
	, means the next msg	- means the last 10

Using "-" before you do any other message summary or retrieve, will causeç
CBBS to start retrieving backwards from the latest message.
     Hack:  e;-;r;-     will ALWAYS retrieve backwards from the latest msg

Once you are "IN" the retrieve function, CBBS will continue to ask you forç
message numbers.  You can "shorthand" them by specifying only the low-orderç
digits that have changed from the previous number you entered.  Thus,

	r;500;3

will retrieve 500 and 503.  To then retrieve message 1, you'd have to
specify 00001, because just 1 would be taken to mean 501.

See keyword "FLAG" for info on flagging summaries for later retrieval.
][CHAT=operator chat facility on CBBS.
Typing CHAT will ring the CBBS terminal bell, and call for the operator. Ifç
there is no answer, control returns to the main menu.  Leave a commentç
instead, using the (G)ood bye command.  
    
>>>> Note, the operator is almost NEVER available for chat, as 
this system has no bell on its terminal.

>>>> CHAT USAGE:  9 out of 10 "CHATs" being INVALID has prompted these 
USAGE GUIDELINES:
- Think of CHAT as CALLING THE OPERATOR to the phone!
- Thus, be sure you have something to say/ask that will be APPROPRIATE!
- If you are not a personal friend of the operator, DON'T even CONSIDER usingç
CHAT to say something like this kind of dialog:
  user: hi
  oper: what's up
  user: nothing special
  oper: "you rang"
  user: yes
  oper: I meant by that, to imply WHAT DO YOU WANT?
  user: nothing special
 
Get the idea?  If you aren't a personal friend of the operator (after allç
personal friends often DO do "chat" ala "hi, what's new", "nothing special,ç
what you been up to", then consider these Appropriate CHAT topics:
- I heard such-and-such was here in a message but I can't find it

(heck, I really can't think of many VALID reasons for CHAT!  Try leaving aç
MESSAGE!)
][DOWNLOAD= file transfers on CBBS/CPMUG
  CBBS software has the ability to do a very limited upload/download, such asç
a club might use to collect articles, or to have a close friend send theç
operator something to try, etc.  It does not come close to having all theç
capabilities of a true RCPM (remote CP/M) system.
  I personally do not have time to collect and maintain copies of "the latestç
and greatest" software in the public domain.  This system is not running aç
hard disk, and could thus not really have some things, like the latest CP/Mç
versions of "modem" with all its overlays, etc.
  Further, when modemming WAS allowed, the most significant use of it was forç
people who didn't even OWN CP/M or PC systems, to "dink" around.  By this, Iç
mean there were dozens of unsuccessful upload/downloads, simply becauseç
"twits" who didn't know what they were doing thought it was fun to see whatç
they could do.  Empty files (ones asked to receive from someone who didn'tç
know what they were doing) were the rule.  I had enough, and turnedç
moddemming off.
  If you REALLY want UPLOAD/DOWNLOAD, leave a COMMENT for me saying what itç
was you wanted to send IN, and what it was for and/or who you expected toç
download it later.  
][OTHER=info on other dial-in systems: see msgs 12-16 on CBBS/Chicago,
(312) 545-8086, 300-1200-2400, many CR's for speed detect.
][SIGNON=Info about signing on to CBBS
CBBS has specific requirements for signing on.  Some people learn of the CBBSç
phone number, but only "stumble" into this information:

CBBS accepts 300, 1200, or 2400 baud at sign-on.  Any 3 keys must be pressedç
for CBBS to respond; the modem tells CBBS what speed you are coming in at.

CBBS sends 8 bits with no parity and does not test nor set parity.
][WIDTH=No variable width output on CBBS, sorry.
CBBS is oriented toward the professional user and experienced hobbyist.  Thisç
group represents about 95% 80-column displays (and even some 132-col).  Thusç
variable width capability is very low on the CBBS "todo" list.
][?=Function list
The ? command shows, in one 80 x 24 screen, a brief list of all of the CBBSç
commands.  Like all commands, you must exit HELP (by hitting return) to typeç
that command.
