SCSI BLUES,
  I have been working on a contract with RISC systems, and got "spoiled"
by them doing big backups onto a single 8mm DAT drive, so decided to plunge
in and get myself a DAT (4mm).
  I purchased the drive from APS 800-233-7550 (orders).  They said it
wouldn't work on my IN-2000 SCSI adapter, nor an Ultrastor.  They recommended
the Adaptec.  I ordered it, too.  THEN, at a computer club meeting, I was
fortunate enough to get Corel SCSI - sets of drivers to sort of make
"anything work with anything".	SO, I got cancelled the Adaptec, got the
drive, and cranked up the software.
  Sigh.
  The software said my IN-2000 ROMS were too old, and when I called for
an update, they wouldn't take a credit card - I had to SEND a CHECK!  So
I decided to forget it, and try my Ultrastor 14F controller.  Well, I
really blew a weekend on that!	Randy Suess offered to try it in HIS
system, and couldn't get it to go, either!  BUT it worked FINE with his
Adaptec, so I said "Screw it", and bought a 1542C.  Once Randy helped me
get some ROMS mapped correctly, etc (I didn't realize the networking
adapter he'd given me had RAM on it - the config referenced ports and IRQ
only), it has worked well.
  Lets see, getting the story out of order here a bit: I decided to leave
my IN-2000 in to run the hard disk and CD-ROM, with the tape on the Adaptec,
NOPE!  Would NOT work!	Flakey problems.  Finally pulled the IN-2000 and put
everything on the Adaptec.
  So, I'm kind of "bummed" about the "promise" of SCSI.
  Maybe it should be called "Yucky", not "Scuzzy".  heh.

R/CARPAL TUNNEL?,
Ward - The March 30 PC Magazine, on page 31, has several 'ergonomic'
keyboards, which might be helpful for carpal tunnel. They are split into
right and left and have palm rests. One has optional foot switches.

R/IDE TIMING PROBS. (CONT),
  About all I can think of is trying something like periscope, that
can single-step thru ROM, then trapping INT 13, and tracing to see where
it runs.

R/LINE FEEDS,
You said that CBBS is taking 2400 calls only. I believe I am logged in at
9600, and I have been calling in at this speed for quite some time. Have
I misunderstood your comment about 2400?

R/PS,
Well, it has working batteries.  I think it's found a home, tho --
I now have a Zenith 386sx notebook to replace it.

You've NEVER got it talking to a PC?  It's EASY.  Use the serial
printer cable and (if you have it) the DAKCOM software.  Plug
the printer cable's 25-pin end into a 25 pin serial port on your
PC (or a 9-to-25 adaptor, etc).  Startup DAKCOM on the Geneva and
set it up for EXTERNAL MODEM, HIGH SPEED (19.2 kbps).  Get a comm
program set up at 19.2 kbps on the PC, talking to the port into which
you have plugged the Geneva.  You're set.  Now, on the Geneva, type
SX followed by your filename and a return.  It'll start an Xmodem
transfer (checksum, I think).  Start an Xmodem receive on the PC and
yer done.  I've been doing this for YEARS!  With DSZ, you don't even
need a comm program on the PC -- just aim DSZ at the appropriate port
and tell it the speed.

I tell ya -- it's getting hard to remember all this CP/M stuff...

MEMORY PRICES UP 53%,
I don't get it: A resin plant in Japan burns down and the price of simms
jump about 53% ??? This single plant had a 60% share of the market for
the resin to make the cases is what I have heard.  This all sounds like
someone is trying to make a killing off of us.	Has anyone heard more?

"POWER" SYSTEM,
Ward, have you considered a program to cache the CD-ROM?  I've seen them,
and they should make a big difference in things like 7th guest.
Hey, if you don't like your system, I'll trade you my 386sx for it
(just kidding)...
BTW, I'm playing around with GEOS today, so I'm talking to you over the
GEOS desktop COMM program.  Cute, but mebbe a little too GUI for me to
handle...

PARTY,
If I were in Chicago, I'd be there.  Alas, I am in NY.	SIGH.  Anyway,
I was on the system LONG before '89; certainly by '85.	I was just
curious as to when I first got in (it was with a version of MDM7xxx
set up for a Kaypro, and the person who gave me the program, which I used
at first with a little Radio Shack 300 bps modem, thoughtfully left
CBBS-1 in the dialing directory...
