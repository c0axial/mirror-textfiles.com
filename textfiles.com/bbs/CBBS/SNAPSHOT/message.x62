PCMANAGE/CLEANUP,
OK, I'm running it - let it go on my WHOLE laptop drive.  It is taking
"forever" (maybe an hour?) to "test" compress every file...  Seems to be
a bit buggy - things like "compression of -6%, 65020 bytes saved", so
it seems there are condx under which it will write MORE bytes in the'
process of compressing!  Strange!  Thus the negative compression is
mis-interpreted as a positive 16-bit integer.  Yet internally it seems
to handle it OK.
  I'll let you know how it works out.  "Interesting".  It says 238K saved
already!  Not sure which ones it found that it could compress the most...

PCMANAGE,
  Well, I let PCMANAGE/DCOMPRESS finish - sadly, it has some problems.
It blows up - "file alocation table bad, drive E" which is my RAM disk
for frequently executed programs.  Only by putting dcompress last does
it SEEM to work...
  There is a newer version - 1.1 - on compuserve, but it still has the
same problems.

R/DBIV?,
  Heh, I did the same thing - made my own checkbook manager.  I wrote mine
in FoxBase (i.e. "xBase") same as you.	I just had a BLAST adding rampant
feature-itis to it, designing nice screens, etc.  I like my check recon-
ciliation a lot - you just hit 'r', and it pops up each un-reconciled
check or deposit, and says "This one Y/N/Quit" and you go y y y y y n y n
y q and what it does it zero the balance each time, then you do a "T"
function that runs a total - it scans from the oldest check for a zero
balance, and starts computing the balance from that point.
  I base mine on a check number (0 for deposit or cash card withdrawal),
date, "to", and two very important flags: a "deposit" flag, and a "cleared"
flag.
  I also had fun doing strange things like "Z", which goes to the bottom
of the file, then backs up about 12 records, then stacks the keypresses
for "down down down down", then goes into browse.  The reason I do this,
is that, like editors, I like my "active" line to be near the top of the
screen, but not THE top line of the screen.
  I have a display function that scrolls from the BOTTOM UP, and changes
colors - 4 colors, for the 4 combos of deposits vs checks, and cleared
vs not.
  One day a friend was over, and asked what my electric bill was like.
I did an extract for "comm ed", popped it into Quattro Pro, and showed a
graph (heh).  I THINK Fox Pro might have some graphics built in.  I bought
it but never installed it.  I talked work into buying the run-time library.
  Owell, hope you find a dBase IV compiler!

R/THE CBBSLIST,
  Hmmm, I did furrow my brow when I saw the name "CBBS" - it IS the name
of THIS system, AND an officially registered name, at that.  Other than
that we carried it as a service for a while (difficult, since we have no
file xfer and I had to mash it into some messages with an editor), there
was no tie-in to CBBS.	Hmmm again.
  I granted the use of its name?  Hmmm, I guess like the guy who said I
promised him a million dollars yesterday, you could BOTH be right, I DO
have a bad memory, but this DOES come as a complete surprise to me.
  (Then again, one day I asked Chuck Forsberg where he came up with the
idea of the name "Ymodem".  He said "You suggested it".  Embarassed, I went
through my old Compuserve captured messages, and found the one I SENT HIM
suggesting the name, because "YAM" was his commo program, and "Y" was one
more than "X", etc)
  CBBSLIST seems as inappropriate (people might come here asking about it-
and do ask "in general" about BBS Lists) just as being the Stillwaters
BBS list they went to him and he wants it stopped.
  Gee, credit where due: Call it the Hideaway Chicago Area BBS list, and
in the front of it credit Stilwaters/Colby for all the effort perhaps.
CBBS in the name just seems confusing and IS misleading.

FAX CLASS 1 VS 2,
I have been 'excercisng' my new fax mode.  It is 14.4K fax & data.
I have had problems connecting with serveral standard fax machines as
well as other fax/ modems.  The majority of the problems went away when
I changed from a Class 2 fax to a Class 1 fax although the software
documentation said to use class 2.  The modem users guide and the
software did not give even a 1 line explaination of the different
classes.  I have also checked one other manual.  Can someone enlighten me?

    IN order to operate under Windows properly I had to use a new COMM
driver in system.ini, ortherwise it would not keep up.
    I was able to send dta to this standard fax machine, but could not
receive a fax from it.
It is about 2 years old, and is a G3 fax machine (a small unit)  Any
idea as to why this is happening?

R/FAX CLASS 1 VS 2,
  I checked my Hayes manual - it doesn't tell squat about FAX.	The
software works fine - I've used it to send and receive faxes - one of
each, so not much of a test case, though!

WINDOWS 3.0 NO S MODE,
my himen.sys file was lost on my ps/1. i have it on a floppy disk, but
i don't know where to put it back. windows 3.0 won't run in standar
or enhanced mode without this file? need help desperately!!
46563,19,01/23/94,WARD CHRISTENSEN,SETH TATEL
R/WINDOWS 3.0 NO S MODE,
Look in your config.sys - the device=himem statement should give the
path of the file - i.e. where it expects it - could be c:\dos or
d:\windows or anything - just copy the file from your floppy to that
directory.
    As to your comment about graphics, sorry, this is the worlds first
BBS, it is by definition a "historical relic".	As author of it (about
16 years ago) I really HATE graphics, because they are so impossible
to capture or upload - I prefer text - when I see something interesting
I can capture it, and when I have some stored info to upload, I can
send it character by character.  I tried Prodigy, but being graphics made
me feel so much like I was playing a video game - when people would
ask a question that I had a STORED answer to, there was no practical way
to upload it, and when I found something useful, I couldn't save it, etc.
I dropped it.
  The only graphics environment online that I will accept is AOL, because
at least I can open arbitrary files (admittedly with a HORRIBLE file
manager that doesn't sort by anything but name, and has no dates) and clip
them to/from a clipboard, etc.
  Good luck with your himem.
