HELLO FROM FLA,US55
Nice to hear about the pizza party and the 15th Anniversary.
I just junked a 1979 North Star Horizon. An example of a great
product in search of any kind of marketing and sales help.
So it goes. Be well, my friend. I'll check in again next year.

R/PALMTOPS..,
  Gee, no, sorry, I didn't SEE any palmtops!  Only spent 2 days, and I
didn't really have a "mission".  I heard someone say "I hear Apple isn't
at this Comdex", so I didn't look.  Also, IBM was EVERYWHERE - all kinds
of different areas by themselves - multimedia, OEM components (IR LAN, etc),
and other things - but not a pure hardware group (PCs, Laptops, etc).

R/HP 1200C DESKJET PRINTER,
Ward:

     Thanx for the HP 1200C/1200C/PS report.  I just received some infor
mation from HP on the printer.	I have priced the machine around Chicago
and come up with about $400.00 off of the SRP.

R/REPLY FROM MIKE B,
  Talk to other 'computers'?  Or do you mean other computer users?
  America On Line, is a large nationwide system (with a "Chicago OnLine")
that has TONS of online "chat" rooms, where different computer users get
together and talk about various topics.

R/APPLE IIE PROBLEM,
Gee Roy, it's been along time since I've seen an Apple IIe. I gave everything
relating to the Apple away years ago. So what I can relate comes from an
imperfect memory. I suggest you remove all the cards and try to boot. If the
same problem persists, try pushing down om all the chips to make sure their
well seated. If the problem doesn't go away it could be either faulty RAM or
a faulty ROM. You may try swapping components with a known working Apple.
I don't know if any of this is of use to you, I'm sorry I can't help more.
