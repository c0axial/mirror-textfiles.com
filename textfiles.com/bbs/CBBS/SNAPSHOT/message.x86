R/COMPUTER CHRONICLES,
  I'll be darned, thanks for the info!	Normally, I would have taped
Chronicles, but I was out of town @ Comdex, & stayed the weekend with
friends.  Heh.
  'preciate the info!
  What was the question?  "Who set up the first BBS?"  or what?
  Thanks again.

R/AN INNOVATION...?,
  Oh, it worked by "induction"?  Hmmm.
  I almost wouldn't believe you if it weren't for an experience of my own:
A customer said that their IBM 3812 printer was "flakey" and that at times
it would take HOURS to print the first page.
  Well, I went there, and tried - sure enough, it was "flakey".  I hooked
up my RS-232 break-out box, and things seemed kind of screwey.	I finally
swapped pins 2-3, and the printer started working VERY well.
  I said "I don't know why, but it IS working, and don't touch that box
under the table the printer is on" (my RS-232 break-out box).
  I called the next day, asked if they used the IBM-supplied cable.  They
said "no, we made our own because we coudln't get the ends thru the little
"dog houses" that go into the floor".  "Could you give me the name/number
of the guy who made the cable?"  ... talked to the guy, he did a 1-1 cable!
The 3812 required a "null-modem" cable!
  All I could figure out was that there was enough signal INDUCED from the
one cable to the other cable!  (2 <-> 3) etc.
  Strage!

NEED HELP TO READ DBF'S/ ETC.,
Is there a book that tells how various packages format the datasets they use?
I know other software can read and produce data bases that DBASE uses.
Does anyone know the name of such a book, the publisher, and who carries it?

1200 BAUD NOT OPERATING HERE?,
For what its worth, CBBS will accept a call from a 1200 baud
modem, but after doing so will only talk at 2400 baud.	Some
recent changes to CBBS that introduced a slight problem?

R/UNIX COMMANDS FOR DOS,
Cool!  How does it compare to MKS, the winner of the Unix-shell-on-DOS
wars?
  Sorry, I don't know where to upload it.  Right, CBBS is a message-only
system.
