R/MF COBOL,
"Downsizing" seems to mean using a computer that was smaller than
the one you started on.  THe next question is "What does smaller
mean?"	MF Cobol can create any kind of screens from character based
mono main frame screens to GUI based, multicolored PC based screens.
THe same program can use used for both interfaces.
MF COBOL is a strong tool form downsizing since the same code can
be used on multiple platforms (Main frame, PC, UNIX, DEC & more).
MF Cobol's strength is in it's ability to run on many computers
without changing the source (except for file locations and other
"local" considerations.)

RE: VOICES ON THE INTERNET,
Having tinkered with this for some time, I'd thought I would drop some
comments:
1) On the newer SUN's, you don't even need a software package to do
   a "radio" broadcast, you can just "cat /dev/audio" to a pipe to
   a remote shell that cats stdin to /dev/audio.
2) Although a one way brodcast will probably work well enough, two way
   conversation is very difficult due to network delays. It will probably
   work acceptably between two very well connected sites, but since most
   sites don't have a T1 coming into their routers, speech gets broken
   too much.
3) At this time, there just is not enough bandwidth, and each speech
   channel will probably eat up 64Kbps.
However, it is obvious that the internet is becoming the modern phone
system in many ways. I wonder how much longer it can exist in it's
current state before it evolves into a new beast under commercial
control.

YOUNG AT HEART?,JWOA
I need to interview a couple of young sysops (or former sysops) for a
magazine piece...under 16 years old is ideal; under 18 may work too.
They needn't necessarily be local to Chicago. Any help would be
appreciated. Alternately, they can contact me at (312) 939-3300 and, if
I'm not available, leave a message. Time is tight on this one, and I'd
like to round up sources next Monday if not earlier. Thanks.

R/GENEVA,
  OK, got it (Monday!)	Guess the flood isn't slowing things down THAT
much.  heh.
  The tape was a surprise - was there once an overlay showing what the
various keys are?  I'll experiment a bit...

R/IDE/LOCAL BUS REVISITED,
  I think there might be an electrical limit to LB of 3 cards, and you
COULD have (1) video; (2) disk (IDE or SCSI) and (3) ?? Haven't heard of
any others!
  I think PCI is going to change that - that's the standard I think espoused
by Intel, for local bus.  Randy Suess tells me it isn't quite as good as
local bus since it is processor-independent, and must therefore be a bit
slower than the Intel-specific local bus stuff (sounds backwards, no?).
  I just added local bus to my system, and went to a 33/66 DX2, my video
went from 12 frames/sec to 45!	If doubling the clock were all I did, I'd
have 24, but I have 45, so local bus really helped (this is a DOS based
graphics benchmark).

3RD LB CARD,
Ward,
  Seems like we have cosmically linked systems..... I found that my video
with a LB using a new generation Cirus enhanced SVGA chip outperformed
a S3 based card (ISA)
  AS for the 3rd card, it will be a network adapter (at least what I
have heard).
  As for a new INtel standard, unless they get a group together I don't
know if it will go anywhere.. and who would use it if it is slower than
VESA LB ?
  And would they look for licensing fees (ala Micro-channel = dead)
Just when I thought 2 slots was the top of the world.....
