COMDEX REPORT,
  Found a few interesting things at Comdex -
 - Deskjet 1200C printer - has separate cartridges, prints very fast; seems
to have much larger paper size capability; they also have a "deskjet" that
looks like it might do D or E size!
  - "morph" - this is a program that morphs one graphic into another - and
does an EXCELLENT JOB.	Price was $74 or so, I ordered a copy.	By example,
they had a (real?) stamp of Elvis, from some foreign country, in which he
was in his Army hat, and another in which he was wailin' away with hair down
over his forehead - the morph between these 2 pictures was VERY smooth,
with almost a look of the hair pulling up, and into the cap, as the cap
appeared.  They nicely morphed between a kitten and a lion, between women
and men (with obviously interesting in-between pictures).  I'll give a
full report when it arrives.
  - fractal image compression - someone finally has an affordable (under
$100) image compression for the PC using fractals.  Up to 100-to-1 compression,
and you can pick the level you need.  Since it determines "areas", and not
just pixels, you can blow the image back up to other sizes without getting
the "jaggies".	For example, if there's a little crescent-shaped light
highlight in the eye of a face, and you blow it up 200%, you don't get a
jaggie highlight, you get one twice as big!
  - Been looking for a laser pointer, but I didn't want to spend > $75, so
whad-ya-know, someone was selling them for $72 @ Comdex!  (wound up going
up to the black anodized one for $82 after all).
  - "Jammer" - a nice (I think!) replacement for band-in-a-box, a MIDI
algorithmic composition/accompaniment program.	Ability to add a lot more
instruments, and have finer control over styles, chord changes (on 8th
notes, not just quarter notes like B-I-A-B).
  Lots of other cool stuff.  VERY tempted to buy Fractal Design Painter
and the bundle with the pressure-sensitive Wacom tablet, but just can't
justify the expense to just have a "new toy" no matter how cool.

COMPUTER CHRONICLES,WARD
On the Computer Chronicles they had the 5th annual trivia bowl.  The first
question concerned you and Randy and the fact that you guys set up the
first bulletin board system.  No one on the two teams got it.

R/OLD TERMINALS,
Good luck selling the oldies.  I've got an ASCII crt, also!  I think the
frame is cracked from where I used to whack it with a board to get the
jitters out of it!  (Tried REALLY hard to find the connector or whatever
was doing that!).
  Your msg upload didn't work - you have to allow a short pause @ beginning
of each line.  1-3 chars were cut off of most lines.
