R/HAM/COMUPTER-FESTS?,
Hi Ward,  Here are the Hamfests I know about:	KARS on May 16th
at the Will County Fairgrounds. (That is in Peotone, the site of the
new airport!) ;-)  Take I-57 and exit at #327.
The Chicago Amateur Radio Club hamfest, May 30 at DeVry.  3300 N
Campbell in Chicago.  Doors open at 8:00 AM.
Hamfesters on August 8th at the Will County Fairgrounds.  See above for
directions.   Gates open at 8:00 AM ( Oh, the first one opens at
6:00AM)
Then you have the Computer Central shows which are held at
The College Of DuPage on the corner of Park Blvd and College Road
in Glen Ellyn, IL.  The hours all start at 9:30 AM and go to
3:00 PM.  The shows dates are: 4-25, 5-23, 7-25, 9-26, 10-31.

Well, I hope this helps!  Kevin

R/VOICE OP,
No problem.  You put the mike inside your gas mask. ;-)
By the way, is carpal tunnel syndrome permanent?

ANYONE IN 312-545?,
  Randy Suess may move to the Southwest - I'd like to keep CBBS going
at its current number - anyone in the 545 area of chicago willing to take
on a bit of history?

NEED VGA TO NTSC OR RGB,
Can anyone reccomend an external device for converting VGA (in some
cases EGA s possible) to either RGB, or a composite output signal?
S-VHS may even work).....
   I need the original VGA monitor to continue to function, even with
whatever swithcing goes on; preferrably 100% external ( no TSR drivers)

SCI & INDUSTRY ,
  The IBM Computer exhibit at sci & industry was closed today - no
indication - anyone know what's up?

R/FIND COMMAND,
Thanks for the note.  I have been using your bullentin board to test our
modem.	It always seems to be available for me to check my systems ability
to connect to another one.

II/E PROBLEM,
Thanks for your suggestions.  I've made a copy of your messages
for my "tool kit."  (The teacher is otherwise occupied with
the school play, etc.  When she's free again, I get back to
her.)
