R/DISK CLEANUP,
Sheesh, I completely forgot about it!  One thing I try to do to manage
what I have, for chinet, is to have a fully qualified subdirectory that
matches chinet.  Thus I have a directory: D:\YAM\CHINET\USR\PUBLIC that
had the file in it - it was sort of "invisible".  I forgot to put it on
my "todo" list.
  My apologies for the effort you put in then I dropped the ball!
  One thing I DID do to help manage my disk, is to buy a REALLY big tape
drive - I can back up everything multiple times to one tape.  Heh.  I'm
thinking of BLOWING AWAY the system, and being more systematic: like
Randy Suess recommended - Windows in its own dir, with NO applications
under it; etc.	That way you can blow away a root dir entry... (though
I could just as easily blow away \win3\coreldrw, etc.)...
  I'll try to remember to take a look at PCMANAGE!

R/DISK CLEANUP,
  Uh, OK, I cranked it up.  I didn't "trust" it so I put it on my laptop,
but I couldn't get it to do anything.  Perhaps I didn't have a large
enough file.  I'll experiment more.  Just to have it record the last ref
date for a file would be useful, but the limit of 100 is a SEVERE limit -
I have for example 300 files in several directories.
  Ah, but come to think of it, there is source, and I could change it...
  Thanks again.
  I still think the best way is to TRASH the system, and restore only
what I need.
  Also Randy Suess suggests a dir w/ the original install files in it,
and another dir with the files you create.  That might help.

R/PS,
I was fiddling around with the program that works with Filink on the
Geneva, and for some reason or other it wouldn't work consistently.  Since
there's still an Osborne Exec about arm's length from here, I never bothered
to fiddle with other stuff.  That connection works reliably.  Most of
the time the stuff that I'm doing can be quickly edited on the Exec and
then printed and that's all I need from it!  Actually, for that kind of
work the machine is still quite good -- 8 MHz CPU and 385K RAM disk make
for plenty fast editing and it has DSDD drives and can copy the finished
work to an IBM-compatible format disk.

It's simply a matter of having a method that works well and not having
the energy to figure out a substitute.	The Exec isn't going away and it's
still quite good for writing letters and stuff.  It's even "green" (uses a
lot less energy than my 486!).

R/GENEVA,
Sure, it has BASIC in ROM.  The base machine is 64K, of which about 24K
can be configured as a RAM disk.  You can add on a "wedge" under the base
machine.  It may be (a) a 300 baud modem, (b) a 120K RAM disk, or (c) a
"multi" unit, with 64K RAM disk, 300 baud modem, and an additional ROM
slot.  The base machine has two ROM slots.  There's a utilities ROM,e
WordStar, Portable Calc, BASIC, and some other stuff.  Parallel port,
serial port, etc.  I dunno what Randy has, but I have a spare 300 baud
modem wedge just waiting for the first hungry buyer!  Oh, yes, there is
a tape drive, as well.

R/PHONE LINES,
I used the term duplex because I forget what terminology is used by the phone
company. I do know that there is  a lower rate for lines used only for
outgoing or incoming calls. I'll look it up and relay the results.
46461,05,09/08/93,MURRAY ARNOW,WARD CHRISTENSEN
R/PHONE LINES,
I just did a very quick and cursory investigation. I believe that Ma Bell
calls the half duplex service Answer Lines. It is at least available on
Telecommunications Channel Services. Maybe a suitable choice is the Type 2001E
 service. I'll leave it to those interested to contact Ma Bell and get better
information.

Thanks for the help at work. We really could have used it before, but
wonder where we can turn to for technical specs/references on the
system boards for the 95 series... Thanks

ENVELOPE PRINTING,FROG
     Can anyone tell me what Volume and Issue Number of PC Magazine that
had an article and program code that described a program to print envelope
on a HP Laser Jet printer.  The article was featured in 1989 or 1990 of
PC Magazine.  The program was for use on the HP Laser Jet only.  It could
be made to work on the DeskJet printer also.

     Can anyone help me out with the correct information?
