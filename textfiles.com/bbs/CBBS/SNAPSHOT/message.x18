IDE (CONT),
	I finally got to the level of removing all upgrades I had made,
and simply swapping the CP-3022 for the newer CP-30104 while only trying
to access the new drive as a 20 Meg drive.  It still froze:  What is needed
is a patch or fix or a means of upgrading the BIOS in the laptop.  As I am
not sure if there is any speed relevant data in the BIOS drive table, this
by itself will not be enough (but it would take care of the drive size
recognition problem)
	A company in Calif. is offering to upgrade this T1600 (286 based)
machine to a 120 Meg drive for $795 (which is just a little too much of
a markup)  They will not sell me the BIOS, nor'update' the code on my BIOS
chip.
	Conner says there is nothing I can do to slow down their drive;
Toshiba has no newer version of their BIOS available.  Where can I find a
company selling laptop BIOS upgrades, or how much work would be involved
in 'fixing' the current code ??

R/IDE SPEED/TIMING/LAPTOPS,
  Heh, sounds like you're really digging in!  A friend merely wanted to
upgrade his LE from, I think, 20M to 40M, and someone at Toshiba support
said it would work (sort of unofficially) but he never got it working,
I think he took it back.
  Won't it read "at all"?  I mean, can you do the bit about one of the
hard disk drivers?  Or even boot a floppy and fire up the hard disk
driver from there?  Probably not...
  Must be a bummer to be SOooo close!
  Are there any other drive brands that might work?  Or was that the bit
about non-standard IDE... hmmm.

LONG TIME AGO,
Hello hello hello. Its been a long long time but u were the first bbs that
I ever used. About 7 years ago I had a DEFENDER unit with a 6 in. monitor
that was borrowed from work to dial up a mainframe at Comm Ed. I thought
that if I could dial up a main frame - why not a BBS. I read about your
BBS in the Sunday paper and it had the phone listed. Since then its been
two computers  and thousands of BBS that me and my son Tim have logged on
to. Thanks Guys -- You are the greatest and the BEST and deserve a place in
computer history !!

R/SCSI TAPE SOFTWARE,
Sytos is the only software I know that seems to support a large number
of different drives.  What kind of unit do you have?

R/SCSI TAPE SOFTWARE,
I think the latest Fastback version supports SCSI tape.

R/CPM BASIC TO DOS BASIC?,
Well, depends on what needs converting.  It sounds like it runs with
22nice, which means that it can't be very hardware-dependent.  If it
isn't peeking and poking a lot, you just load it up in MBASIC and
save it with a new name, followed by a comma and an A. That will save
it in ASCII format.  You should then be able to load it in GWBASIC,
since (as far as I know) GW is pretty much a superset of CP/M
MBASIC (after all, GWBASIC is a MicroSoft product!).

The one reason that you're having trouble now is probably that the
program is saved in tokenized form to save disk space.	The DOS BASICs
do this too, but use a different format than do the CP/M basics.  Once
you have the program in ASCII form, you should have no more trouble.

You might even be able to get it to run under QBASIC, which would make
it even nicer...

BBS EXPO,EXPO
Hi Ward..

Realize that you are busy and probably get many messages daily bugging
you to do one thing or another.. I hope that you aren't looking at us
in the same fashion..

Hope that you have received the past few issues that I sent to you and
that you had time to look them over a little to know where we are
coming from (or trying to anyway! <GR>).

Would like to talk with you.. I had suggested that you leave a voice
number for me to call you at our cost.. if that isn't ok.. maybe you
could call me collect either at my office: 609-953-9110 or at my
home office before 11pm est.. 609-231-1757.

Hope that the "commercialization" of BBSing hasn't turned you completly
off! BBS EXPO would not be the same without your presence and that is
what I would like to talk to you about..

Thanks for taking the time to read this..
