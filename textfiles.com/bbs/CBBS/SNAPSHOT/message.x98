CURT & ALL,
My BBS is back. I was out of town, it was Thunder storm season, the dog ate
my diskette, etc. Actually I was out of town, our constant battle with heat
in the summer.
Interesting note: If you run your computer(s) constantly, as I do. Open them
up and blow out the dust every 2 or 3 weeks. I never realized how much it
builds up in that short of time.

R/GENEVA,
Thanks, so far no word on the BASIC ROM.  That would be nice, lets give him
a bit more time.  Do you have an easy way to make one?	Does the Geneva
have a speaker and a sound command like the HX-20?
  One thing I thought would be interesting to use a laptop computer for
would be to take it with you in the car, and have a little timing program
running that would allow you to tap the space bar every time the speedo
went another mile.  Then you could come home and plot a speed chart - it
would just be interesting to see what it looks like particularly during
rush hour, etc.  Obviously it would be more interesting if it were more
precise - like driven off the magnet on the wheel that runs the cruise
control, so you could see the speed on the tollway, etc.

II/E PROBLEM,NONE
Ah yes... I remember the screen full of garbage well.  About 5 years
ago I had a similar problem with my daughters II/e.  Unfortunately
I do not remember which chip.  I tried "rocking" all chips, connectors,
etc. all to no avail.  The "brute force" method I used (rather than
trying to isolate which gate in which chip was the offender) is as
follows: 1)Make a list of all the 74--- series chips in the machine.
Note, there are duplicates. 2)Purchase one each of all the chips (I
believe this set me back all of $5-7 at Tri-State Electronics.
3)Substitute half (binary search) of the chips at a time.  You will
soon correct (and if you continue isolate) the bad chip.  Any
questions?  Ask.  Good luck!  P.S. I don't remember which chip but the
symptoms you describe are exactly the same.

COMPUTER POWER GROUP,
Has anyone ever used the services of the consulting firm
Computer Power Group?	I'm just checking them out because
the are international and seem to be big.
Let me hear from you good or bad.
