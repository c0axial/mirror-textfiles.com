TAPE IMAGE BACKUPS,
As the quality of software and performance has increased we have moved
away from some of the ways in which things happened.  One such example
that comes to mind is tape backups.  At least the units I was famimliar
with did tape streaming, and simply put each block out to the tape: No
directories of files, individual recall, etc. (basically for crash
recovery only)
      I am now playing with a hard drive that lost its FAT and was
'virused' in some way.	It would be real noce to be able to back it up
to my colorado tape unit in a streaming mode regardless of what the data
is so that if I make some progress but mess up, I can put each and every
sector back on the drive and start over ( or to the last backup before
I hypothetically messed up)
   Right now I'm doing nothing but examing for fear of the above.  Is there
software out there of this nature.  On a side note it would also remove
the weaknesses of Novell in that it will not allow itself to be backed
up, but must be re-installed.

R/NORTH STAR,
Hey -- Steve I still have myN* Horizon.  I haven't turned in on for
over two years.  I believe in North Star DOS  LI is the command to
list the files on the disk.
I have three North Star museum pieces.	I wating until the "Collector
items" become valuable.
For now it's back to my 486 with lots of RAM and os/2.

R/LONG TIME AGO,
I dunno about "Greaters" or "Best" but it DOES seem we were first!
Thanks for the kind words!

R/LAPTOPS,
  Well, I'll just say that I'm very pleased with the 3 Toshibas I've had.
They are NOT the best price-performers, but definitely generally good
stuff!

R/QQ: WHY DO FLOP-DRIVES DIE?,
The biggest failure I find is in the hub assembly getting nicked or
slighly out of alignment and the doors won't pop open , leaving the
disks stuck in.
   Drawing on experience from back when it was worth fixing drives,
I found most failres to be in the head itself.	A wire would be overwrapped
or the fwrrite would be cracked and over timethrough vibration, and aging
of the epoxy that this would trigger a failure.  I was able to fix a couple
with tweezers, steady hands and a very small soldering iron.
   one other quicky:  use standard cassette head cleaning solution on the
drives heads and try demagnitizing them...

THANKS,
Thanks for your response.  I've already tried q-tips and alcohol.
I'll see if I can find my old tape-recorder head demagnatizer.
As for broken wires, I did check the continuity of the top head's
wires.	I'm not sure if I can get at the lower head's.

THANKS,EXPO
Ward..

MEMORY >16MEG,
I have begun reading up on memory limitations above 16MEG and am getting
a little confused.
  1) Is this a problem with ALL ISA machines ??
  2) Does it only apply to certain cards and/or disk controllers
  3) DOes it only occur when using virtual memory ???

I have a couple of IBM files and INternet traffic on the subject and they
seem to read that is a problem with certain disk controllers.
It also has problems with DMA/ bus mastering cards ( any type)
 Now my PC has an option to set memory >16M as non-cacheable... also
what if you have 20MEG and set up NO swap file on disk.
  Or finally, is the limitation more generic than all of this, and lies in the
address lines available in an ISA slot (can'nt even find a pin-out right
now).. sort of how some 8 bit cards get confused by the addressing of
a 16 bit card ( I had a lot of problems with S3 chips and 8 bit I/O cards)
ly out of alignment and the doors won't pop open , le
