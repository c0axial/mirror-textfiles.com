CHEAP INK,
Well, not cheap, REALLY, but close.  INMAC (the company everyone seems
to love to hate, including me) has a deal on high-capacity black
printheads for the DJ series -- their catalog says "buy two for $47.50,
get one free!"	Well, after tax & shipping it was $55, but that's still
pretty good for 3 high capacity units, and they arrived the next day.

That works out to about $18.30 per cartridge, tax & shipping included;
I don't know what they go for in Chicago, but the same cartridge would
cost $38 EACH at our college bookstore.

My advice?  Order a few and stock up!

R/FLASH: DAMAGE NOT FROM VIRUS,
  Gee, I just blew the last 4 days trying to get a tape drive going,
perhaps I should blame THAT on Viri!  Sadly, it was just the Scsi Blues,
i.e. you can't just pick your controller, and your devices, and get 'em
to work together.  Examples: Archive tape drive will work with Sytos,
but only with ASPI driver.  Corel SCSI (software) complained that the
ROM on my controller was too old.  Another controller just was flakey.
A third finally did it, (Adaptec) but only after removing the hard disk
scsi controller and putting everything on one.	(Well, the CD rom isn't
working yet, haven't tried).
  Let me check my progress...hah, what timing, backup 100% complete,
rewinding to do the verify...  Here's hoping!

HAAALP,
randy, chinet is kicking me off.  i'm flummoxed because i'd just
changed the final 'eval' line in my .profile, trying to start up
in elm instead of pico, and when i logged back in to test it I
got kicked off "elm not found" (i guessed the wrong path, probably)
but *then* i logged in as newuser, and got booted *again*... so is
everyone getting booted by a global bug?  if it's just me, can you
repair my .profile?  thanks...	Jorn

MESSAGE UPLOAD,FROG
Ward:

     I was able to upload my two long messages to this BBS without
having to type them in on line.  I had the messages created off line and
then copied them to the Windows clipboard and then pasted them in when
the BBS was ready to accept input message lines.   I had to slow down the
character pacing and line pacing quite a bit for the system to accept them
without error.	Also and CR/LF that I had for line spacing threw the
system out of wack.  I had to add blank characters before the CR/LF for
the system to accept the line spacing.	I think that I am now able to
handle the message upload function now.  This at least gives me the ablility
ability to create lengthy messages off line and then upload them to the
BBS message area.  The pace that the characters are sent in, I can type
them in faster but who wants to bother with repetitive tasks, that is
what computers are for.

R/PROBLEM WITH 20 MHZ 286,
Roy,
   As a previous message pointed out, you have to get into the BIOS setup
on power up.  From a cold reset ( not CTR-ALT_DEL) you have the most time
while it is counting the memory hit the DEL key, several times if needed.
It should throw you into setup.
  @nd,	the AT was 8 MHZ, right ???   I have never seen a < 386 Motherbrd
where you could change the bus clock spped, but who knows.  Most cards
will take up to about 11.5 Mhz before flaking out, but with OLD IBM
cards, who knows.. ( I never have had a REAL IBM PC)
ALso as suggested prior, try a different keyboard, and if necessary
try settin git to AT then XT (older keyboards did not auto sense, newer
ones like found today automatically switch between XT & AT modes).

R/CPM BASIC TO DOS BASIC?,
Andy--
Well, it worked.  I'd tried that in the past, but kept getting error
messages when I ran the program.  This time, however, I ASCII'd and DOS'd
all the chained files in the program before running, and Voila!, it worked.
I appreciate the suggestion, and the comments about pushing and popping whcih
compelled me to translate all the .bas files before running.  Thanks...
But I have another question...do you know how to change the program to
initialize a different printer?  I can't find it in any of the Basic
references I have.  Lastly, how would one go about printing a report
generated by this program to disk, in stead of to the printer?
Thanks!

R/CPM BASIC TO DOS BASIC?,
Well, one step at a time.
First, what do you mean by 'initialize'?  Unless you're running a serial
printer, the output just goes to LPT1.	If you want to set up the printer
to do something fancy, like tiny fonts or whatever, you'll need to add
some LPRINT statements to pump out the appropriate code.

As for getting the output to disk instead of a printer, it depends.  If
the thing is just LPRINTing it to a printer, I believe that you can just
open a file for sequential writes and change the LPRINT statements so
that the output goes to that file.  It's in the BASIC manual, which I
don't have, and in the code for your program, which I also don't have.

What is the software that you are trying to convert, anyway?
