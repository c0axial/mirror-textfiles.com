IDE/TIMING & BIOS ERRORS,
Ward,
  Have you heard of any flakey problems with "long transfers' and IDE
drives with older BIOS's?  I am still playing with that Toshiba 1600
trying to get a larger drive in it.  I'm playing hot-potatoe (could'nt
resist) with On-Track Computer SYstems and Conner trying to figure out
what is wrong.	The machine originally had a conner 20M IDE drive in it
so these hang-ups dpn't seemt o me to be IDE timing related.
  Problems include timing out (30-60 seconds) when using XCOPY to
move one partition oto the next, and installing windows will somtimes hang
up)
    On-track gave me some crap about certain conner dirves not translating
above 1024 cylinders, but I don't think it is the case.  It is also hanginh
on a segate 245M drive I just tried tonight?
    ANy insight ???

R/IDE/TIMING & BIOS ERRORS,
  No, sorry, that's a new one on me!  I only have experience with 2 IDEs,
and the slowest was in a 286.

R/VOICE ON THE INTERNET,
  Wow, that was cool!  - voice on the internet!  However, I shudder to think
of the bandwidth consumption!
  I also shudder to think of the day voice becomes popular in the business
community - I have to admit it I am SO unhappy with this - I have to say
it - ASS - at work, who has a screen blanker on his PC, that bounces a
padlock around the screen (as many do) but his "beeps" and "peeps" off
the screen borders, like an old pong game.  IMAGINE, a NOISY PC accessory
that only engages when you are AWAY FROM YOUR DESK.
  Another guy stuck some kind of OS/2 multi-media thingie in, and when he
does a shutdown, it plays taps.  Well, it tries.  It is grainy, slow,
AGONIZINGLY slow, ... I'd have thought he would remove it after the "fun"
of hearing it once or twice, but NO.
  BY WHICH I MEAN: imagine the day when many people are TALKING to their
PCs - either voice annotating things, or doing voice input, etc.  I don't
think I could take it.	YET, with carpal tunnel or pinched nerves or
whatever I have (going to the doctor tomorrow) I may be the first one to
really NEEDS voice input to continue some degree of my participation in
some PC activities.

R/SOME FAX/MODEM DETAILS,
  Thanks!  Interesing stuff!  Now that you've got "CLASS" figured out,
do you know what "GROUP" is?

DJ INK CARTRIDGE ABRASION,
    The last ink cartridge I used in my DeskJet 500 printer started
misfiring on a set of contiguous dots.	Using a loupe, I examined
the head for clogged jets, and found none.
    But I did discover that there were gaps in several of the
electrical traces on the outside of the cartridge.  The gaps seemed
to be the result of abrasion:  They were on the plastic backing where
it bends around the cartridge; and the closer they were to the
left (leading) edge of the cartridge, the wider they were.
    Looking over the previous five cartridges I had used, all but one
exhibited the same type of damage.
    Has anyone else observed this type of damage?

TAPE DRIVE REPAIR ,
I have a Wangtek tape drive that has stopeed writing properly.	It reads
fine, and the 2nd (remaning drive works fine).	I am looking for a local
(hopefully) service center or repair depo that can fix this thing at
a reasonable rate.  By standard places for MB's , print heads, etc.
do not work on these units.  Can anyone suggest a company ?
THanks.

SCSI,
Some things I think I've learned:
 - fast means 10mb (normal is 5)
   - the drives and controllers adopt - agree - on the lowest common speed.
 - WIDE means 16-bit.  At least in IBM, you can get 16-8 bit converters to
   run old 8-bit drives on a "wide" controller's ribbon cable.
  Anyone know if SCSI II is the one that supports 15 devices?

RESISTOR=FUSE?,NONE
I'm reviewing "the Underground Guide to Laser Printers", a collection of
articles from Flash Magazine, whichis published by the folks out in West
Topsham, VT, who run BlackLightning, Inc., a toner cartridge rebuild/
refill operation.  'Tis rather interesting, but I came across an odd
(to me) statement:
     "The final part thatmay need to be replaced is the fuser
      lamp fuse.  This is a 47, 1/4 watt resistor next to the
      power supply."
I have no technical expertise to evaluate this.  Are resistors sometimes used
as fuses?  I assume that anything that will "blow" under excess load
could be so used, so long as it blows before something critical.  Can
someone enlighten me?

R/RECHARGABLE ALKALINES,
Have you taken the charger apart yet?  Is there any circuitry that look
s like some form of power pulsing as someone else has desbribed as an
old way of recharging alkalines?  Do you have a scope you can put on the
outputs?  Have you tried recharging plain 'old' duracells?
