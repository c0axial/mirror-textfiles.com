R/68000 FRIMWARE?,
Thank you for responding to my question.  I also appreciate the sarcasm
about my typing errors.  Where can I find this publication.  I find that
dealing with Motorola, or trying to get any documentation, or data books
is like trying to pull teeth from elephants.  I waited a month to get info
on the new micro contoller series.  Some of MOE's componenets have a 40
week lead time. I know the MOE 68000 series has been out for eons, but
in my specific application, I need to use the processor.  I have never
used this processor, but I have used many others.  I would like to cut down
some of the time it will take me to develop a monitor. If a monitor is out
there then why try to reinvent the wheel?  Thanks for some info.

R/AN INNOVATION...?,
It goes INSIDE the keyboard cable coil.  You've probably done like me --
waiting on the phone, you manage to wrap the coil cord around a pencil.
My 'innovation' (single quotes) works the same way -- I just wraped
the coil around the mouse cable.  It's conceptually weird (at least it
was for me!) because it looks like you shouldn't be able to do that.  But
it works.  I suppose that if you don't have a coiled cable, it could
be a lot harder... :-)

CABLES...,
I'm not sure I'm explaining this clearly, so here goes again.  Take
your mouse (well, trackball that fits on the keyboard).  It has a long
straight cord.	Stretch that out so that one end is right by the point
where your keyboard cable comes out of your keyboard.  Now, stretch
out the coiled keyboard cable and wrap it around the mouse cable so that
the latter goes along the inside of the loops.	Like I said, weird, but
it works.  When I first had the idea, I thought that I'd have to MAKE an
extension cable for the mouse, and put on the connector AFTER I'd
run the cable through the coils.  But the coils AREN'T CLOSED.	It's all
one long opening.   #@$$%! It's harder to explain than to do...

1ST BBS QUESTIONS,FBBS
Dear Mr. Christensen,

 I am writing a short article about BBS's for a new computer magazine in the
 'region' called Computer REGISTER.  I always like to include some historic
 perspective when writing about techincal stuff.

 My first computer was an Osborne 1 and I was aware of your contribution of
 Xmodem and setting up the first BBS.  I just didn't know any of the details. I
 asked one of our writers if he could sleuth around on the internet to find out
 some more details.  This eventually lead to finding the number for your BBS.
 (You may be getting email from Mike DeVore...). All this time I imagined that
 you lived in California!

 So I get my facts right, is it true:
 1.  You wrote Xmodem (checksum), the very first PC file transfer protocol?
 2.  You also wrote Xmodem/CRC?
 3.  You set up the world's very first BBS in 1978?
 4.  You and Randy Suess together created the first BBS?
 5.  The first BBS was called "Ward & Randy's BBS" and ran CBBS at inception?
 6.  The first BBS operated at 300 baud?
 7.  You conceived the idea of a computer bulletin board system?

 I also would very much like to know:

 1.  Who are you, what do you do?  (A nuclear engineer? Professional hobbiest?)
 2.  Where did the BBS idea come from? (College project? Vivid dream? Sci Fi?)
that instead? Thanks. Steve Culver (414) 786-8731 voice 786-9194 fax/bbs-sysop
... I ascii uploaded this, i hope it is legible. Thanks for reply.

R/PAY RESPECT,
Welcome!  (Should I call you "sysuser"?  Heh  I'm "Ward").
  Yes, I'm sure you're the first Malaysia call.  Lucky you got in,
since CBBS seems broken and only does 2400 baud.  Yes, no files.  With
a single line, that's the best way to keep it open for messaging folks -
as I've felt since it went up in '78.

UNIX COMMANDS FOR DOS,
My partner and I have developed a suite of Unix commands for DOS because
we found the DOS command set limiting after working on Unix.  We are
planning to market 'DOSNIX' by uploading a subset of the commands as
shareware to various BBS's.  Any suggestions for the best one's?  This
is my first time on CBBS and from the description of the hardware, doesn't
look like the place for a software archive - or am I missing something?
We will also FTP our shareware to servers on the internet.  Know some
good ones?  Thanks1
