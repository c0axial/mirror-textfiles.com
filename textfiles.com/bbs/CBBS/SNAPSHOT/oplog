New oplog after CBBS crashed due to 9600 modem dying (burned up ROMS) and
then the hard disk refused to spin (sigh).
]FROM: ALEX,ZELL,07/23/89,06:13:26,
And no backup.
Took a couple attempts to recall how to add to oplog.
If y'all have noticed that I'm using 300 bps:  my keyboard became
defective and while waiting for a replacement I'm using my Ozzie.

Seems like nobody likes oplog any more.
Testing new .
Get an occasional bit of line noise here -- nowhere else.
]FROM: ALEX,ZELL,11/01/89,07:13:12,
Well.  In prev item I had backed over and written f*"xt clone" which
didnt show up. In preceding line I{did some backover.  Lessee what
happens.

Other than a bit more line noise -- did fine. owell.

Hey, finally you looked in here, Tony.
I just had the dubious privilege of k'ing #43000.  Its author didn't
do a lot better with 43001, but at least it is legible.
How is your recovery coming along?  Are you immobile or?
Need anything?

Hmmm. *sigh*

Happy birthday, oplog.

Today is Friday.
It is the 13th of April.
Today is Good Friday.
I trust it will be a *good* Friday.
Today is my mother-in-law's birthday.
She is 90 years old.
Happy Birthday!

Forgot to mention: She is in a nursing home. She has senile dementia or
Alzheimers. Almost impossible to differentiate while alive. Much
similarity in the symptoms.

  Seems to be the time for it - my father is getting quite depressed now,
wondering what it is all about.  His mind isn't sharp, but it isn't dull
either.  He's just bored, feels he's a pain in the butt - being lifted out
of bed, wheel-chair for meals, etc.  Pain.

About that OPLOG...

...it only took me two tries. First try was "OPLOG". Next try was "LOG". Gad,
too lazy to find my ancient copy of CBBS docs after my first call back here in
nearly a year.

Hello All, I don't check in here often...Pretty much back to normal now
Alex ...thanks for asking. Still walk with a limp....whata ya expect.
I'm flying again...and do not plan to miss my annual trip to CO. for skiing.

Hey, don't we have a list of the names and addresses of the sysops here
I was going to give us all a logon to by semi-private BBS. No big deal huh.
]FROM: ALEX,ZELL,11/05/90,00:07:52,
Yep, we used to have "opradd.log" or something like that.  It got
lost in the big crash and never revived.  We'll have to remind Ward
again to install it again, but mebbe we had better give him all the
full and new info again.  I'll check the ward/dolton board to see if
he has the opradd log there.  Don't recall.

Three and a half months.  CBBS/Chinet party hosted by Ward is history.
I didnt go but Pete brought me my name tag and stuck it on the front
of my machine.	One of these days I may put together part of an
operadd.log.

Ward sent us (randy, chaz and me) a "do not resuscitate" request for
cbbs a couple days ago.  Randy fixed anyway and we are back in business.

Roy Lipscomb uses VT-100 cursor-backspacing, seems to be ESC-Bracket-D.
  Also lengthen the timeout warnings.

Tony used the "S" word in public!
Said he was the 1st asst Sxxxx of w ...[this CBBS]."
OK...*sigh* So I'm tonly the 2d or 3d or 4th asst operator, but I
believe I am the only one permitted an alias.

  Hehe.  Ya, an alias (grin).  "Michael Philips" still tries, or
"Philip Skom" - both are Phil Scopes.  Still raises my pulse to see
that name, he was SUCH a twit!

Oh yeah, I remember good old Phil Scopes...major twit! I have a two time

OK, so I can't remember CBBS commands (fades after a decade and a half of
calling). I entered a couple LOG headers by accident.
While in here....whats new/news with you all? I see Ward has posted for the
annual pizza party...looking forward to it! I will bring the fotoman again
and record the event.
]FROM: WARD,CHRISTENSEN,01/30/94,15:30:37,
Hey, Tony!  Hi!  Glad you can bring the photoman... will be cool
Randy will be bringing some games, network, etc.  SHould be pretty cool.
  Meanwhile I'm trying to remember how to back up cbbs on the network -
I get an "invalid drive" message if the network went down since the last
time I tried it, so we have a problem there... I have to manually do some
things - heh - things - what a great word - and I thought I'd logged them
in the OPLOG.
