NORTH STAR?#@,
Hi Ed, I just read your message to Ward.  I still have my North Star
computers, but they have not been turned on in years. I can't afford to
keep then and I can't consider throwing them out.  THe Dimension doesn't
work.  Alas, I bought a Northgate.  Recently I upgraded it to 8 meg of
RAM.  Remember the days  when a meg went for more money than your
yearly salary?
Keep well!
Donnie

R/FRIMWARE,
Yes I recieved the packet of information and it is the best thing that you
could have ever done for me.  I really am surprise on how much trouble
I put you through. I hope I can return the favor sometime.  The info
gives me a base to work from.  I don't have to start from sratch.
This is going to save time effort and trouble.	My only problem is during
the debugging stage, since I can't afford a decent emulator, will be pain-
ful and very time consuming.  If you have any bright idea's throw them
my way.  This project is going to be rough enough. (please excuse my lousy
 sepellign)
thank you very much  :)

NOT THAT INNOVATIVE,
Cute, but, alas, no.  The innovation, in this case, was merely having
a single batch of wires going to the machine.  Induction would be a
cute trick, but I can see that resulting in LOTS of problems :-].

For me, the weird thing was realizing that you COULD put a wire
inside the coil cord without having to slide it through end to end.  It's
like those 2-or-3-prong fork optical illusions.

IBM CIRCA 1970,
Maybe you can confirm something I heard about 20 years ago. When I was doing
my graduate work in Cincinnati around 25 years ago a friend of mine worked
for IBM in Lexington, KY. He mentioned that they were using PC's. He also
said that it was for internal use only and that IBM saw no market for them.
He said that their only marketing strategy was selling the mainframe computers
Have you ever heard any stories at Big Blue regarding this?

R/GENEVA,
If Andy can't find the BASIC ROM, let me know, and I'll send you mine (or a
copy of it).

APPLE IIE,
Roy,
  Those power supplies are also notorious for going flakey.  Thow a scope
on the power in and check for a clean signal and voltage.  Also a couple
of sprits of contact cleaner on the socketed chips, ( re-seating them)
also helps.
