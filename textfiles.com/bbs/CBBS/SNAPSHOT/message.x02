CARPAL TUNNEL,
  I don't think carpal tunnel is permanent - mine is five times better
than it was - just like my Tennis elbow went away after a summer of not
playing.
  Smart: I have started typing a LOT less, using the control key less
(kills my productivity).
  Dumb: I have not sought professional help for it.

R/SOUND ADAPTERS,
Ward:

     This is to be put in my 8580-111 that has been upgraded to a 486-33
with SCSI for the HD, CD-ROM, and 3.5" R/W Opt drives.	The Sound Blaster
works but has problems with Enhanced mode Windows.

R/HP 1200C DESKJET PRINTER,
Ward:

    The SRP of the HP 1200C is $1995.00 and the 1200C/PS is 2395.00.
The street price is about $400.00 cheaper on each model.  The largest
size paper is 8.5X14 same as the HP LaserJet models.  I think that HP
will probably come out ith another model in about six months called the
1800C and the 1800C/PS that will print on 12X18 paper or B-size.  They
have developed larger ink cartridges for the 1200C and I believe that this
is a prelude to a larger paper size.  The printing speed is also up on
this machine, faster than the DeskJet 550C.  What do you think?

R/GENEVA,
Well, actually I don't have a way to make a copy, but I have a friend
who does (Bill Wolff), so it shouldn't be a big problem.

I've never gotten much into the innards of the thing, but there is a clock
of some sort, so it just might be possible.  I do have a set of manuals, if
Andy doesn't/didn't furnish any, if you'd like to look at them.  [Not to
mention a spare 300 bps modem wedge, rah rah!]

WINDOWS TERMINAL,
When I log on the info comes in waves rather
than one line at a time. Any suggestions?
Thanks
