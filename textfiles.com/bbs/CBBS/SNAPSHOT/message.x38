R/CBBS HISTORY,
  1. When did it go online?  "Early" February - but most people didn't
believe I could get it programmed or Randy could get the hardware done
from "invention" to "implementation" that quickly, so we settled for
Feb 16th as the official "birthday" - one month from the fateful Jan 16
'78 snowstorm that spawned the idea of CBBS
  2. What did it run on ?  A home-built S-100, probably 64K & 2 floppies
  3. Yes, both system and software were called CBBS - Computerized
Bulletin Board System.
  4. Did I put CBBS in the public domain?  No.	MODEM.ASM which became
XMODEM was put in the public domain.  I OK'd Randy selling copies of CBBS
for $50 (after friends told me I was nuts to only ask $25).
  5. I first heard about computers in '74, when I learned of the 8008
microprocessor.  I learned that "TTL" electronics was what it connected
to, and taught myself TTL, i.e. "digital" electronics in the summer
of '74, so that when I bought an Altair 8080 Kit in '75, I could design
and build my own selectric typewriter and floppy disk interface.
(the fact that that floppy interface was therefore not compatible
with what became the IBM standards years later, was the impetus to write
MODEM.ASM that became known as XMODEM)
  Randy was a "HAM", I wasn't.	I don't really know what Randy's electronic
background was - he had done computer repair for IBM, and worked for
Datapoint at the time, I think.
   6. CBBS was installed in Chicago.  I suggested it be at my house, since I
had a phone line for the computer club answering machine, butr Randy
suggested it be in Chicago instead so got a line for it.
  7. Photographs?  No, not that I'm aware of.  It was on the cover of a Trib
magazine "weekender" or something, I think.

R/MORE QUESTIONS,
  Randy and I were members of CACHE, yes, but when I suggested we do
something related to CACHE, Randy said that that would be the old problem
of being worked on "by a committee" and suggested we forget the club and
just do it between the two of us.  He said "I'll do the hardware, you
do the software.  When will it be ready?".  Heh
  2. MODEM was done in the summer of '77, and released on the CP/M
users' group disk #6 in September of 77, putting it in the public domain.
CBBS was invented on 1/16/78, and did NOT support file transfers -
it was and is a message-only system.
  Oh, northstar horizon?  Interesting?
  P.S. quick tip on entering msgs - don't put in blank lines, makes it
show up less per screen (I'm running on a friend's mac, and it is a real
pain scrolling back and forth, heh).

FAN CLUB :-),
OK.  I have an obsolete machine, on which I don't want to spend that
much more money (except, perhaps, for RAM, which has no bearing here).
It's a 386sx running @ 25MHz, and all is well and good, except for the
fan.

The fan is loud enough, and has always been loud enough, to be just a
little distracting (I used to use a CP/M machine with a RAM disk, no
fan, so I'm picky about noise).

Now, I have noticed that the air blowing out of the case is room
temperature, and there are no hot spots on the case (and none when I run
it case off, and touch chips to check).

My stupid question is -- given this information, would it be reasonable
for me to disconnect the fan from its power source, and run the machine
without it?  Or, alternatively, does anyone know of a thermostat that
could be installed to switch the fan on/off?  I know there are power
supplies with 'variable speed fans' out there, but fitting one into
my case would cost >$100 plus labor.

Am I thinking of doing something stupid, or could I expect the machine
to continue living without a fan?  I note that Radio Shack sells, or
used to sell, a machine without a fan -- anyone heard anything bad on
that one?

QQ:  <PAUSE> KEY SCAN CODE?,
Can anyone tell me the keyboard scan code for the <pause> key?
(This is the single key that acts like the control-numlock
key combination.)  I'm writing an TSR in which I have to fake
a press of the <pause> key.  (The environment I'm serving
seems to ignore the "ctr-numlock" bit at 40:18.)  Thanks.

MOVIES & COMPUTERS,
  Just got back from seeing Jurassic (sp?) Park.  Special effects: Great!
  Apparently many movie techniques like J.P. & morphing in Terminator II,
are done on computer.
  But I have a question: what is the OUTPUT device?  I mean, how can you
do something with a computer, and when shown on 70mm or 35mm on a huge
movie screen, not look like it was computer generated?	Is it, like,
4000 x 4000 resolution or something like that, and filmed in multiple
exposures, i.e. one for red, one for green, one for blue - so that they
don't need a "shadow mask" which would show up?
  I've bought some large pictures like of Mandelbrots, but you could see
the shadow mask.
  Thanks!

R/MOVIES & COMPUTERS,
It is possible to transfer a computer image directly to film with laser
imagers( medical images are reproduced to a high degree of resolution this
way). I assume that it should be possible using the same technology to make
multiple exposures of an image to get color reproduction. The latter is
strictly a guess.
