R/VOICE INPUT,
  Ya, I saw that thing today @ CompUsa.  I am sufficiently intrigued
with the Dragon systems, and how it can do FULL text input... though
not continuous speeth - sort of "discontinuous".  Have to leave time
between each word.

R/AUDIO SOLUTIONS BOARD,
Ward:

     Take a look at PC WEEK Vol 10 No 22 dated June 7, 1993.  The
article is IBM announces audio board for multimedia on page 30.  This
is the best that I can do for now.  The announcement is from the IBM
Entry Systems Technology group.  The article goes into some detail.

HEAT & NOTEBOOKS,
Has anyonw noticed that the new releases of notebooks are 'packing'
dx2 chips ???  I am wondering how they can keep these things cool
enough to operate without frying the insides or having a meltdown.
Take the TI with the DX2/66 in it:  A regular one has a heat sinc and a mini
fan built into it.  No way that can fit inside.
 input... though
not continuous speeth - sort of "discontinuous".
