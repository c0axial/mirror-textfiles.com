R/CBBS NOT RETIRING,
Ward mentioned something in an earlier message about CBBS having
become "boring," and led me to believe that he was not longer
going to support it (i.e. take it down).  Glad to see there
probably was a misunderstanding on my part.  I guess I didnt'
need to remind Ward that if he didn't want to spend time
maintaining CBBS, there would be plenty of others who would
be glad to serve as s**ops.  (Thanks for reminding me that this
is a family board!)

CBBS IN C,
Do you have the "C"BBS project mapped out yet?	And/or farmed out?
I still have the phone number of the fellow who offered you some
low-level routines.

AN INNOVATION...?,
Here's my innovation of the week -- the monocable!  Earlier today I
bought a little clip-on trackball (PC Accessories, the generic red,
white & blue box brand) and put it on the right side of my desktop
keyboard.  Since it has a very short cord (1' or so), I bought a monitor
extension cable (9 pin) and wound it into the coiled keyboard cable.
Behold!  One wire, two devices!

Actually, the little trackball is kind of cute.  It's the size of a
MicroSoft or Logitech portable trackball, but the bracket clips it on
flat, so that the critter is at the same angle as the keyboard.  It has
three buttons arranged around the ball, and one LED.  When you press
either the right or left buttons and the bottom button at the same time,
the right or left button locks and the LED lights.  Pressing the bottom
button again releases your selection.  It works well in the graphics
programs I use, though I must admit that the action isn't as nice as my
Trackman (which now goes to my 4-year-old, who finds rodents as
frustrating as I do).  Oh -- at CompUSA, the PC Accessories Mini
Trackball was less than half the price of its Logitech and Microsoft
brethren.

Has anyone else here strung multiple cables together to eliminate
desktop messiness?  I'm curious.

NOVELL DOS 7?,
I've heard that this is beta testing NOW, and that it is a command-
driven OS that supports true multi-tasking.  Anyone seen it?  Heard
about it?  If you have a (non-OEM'd) copy of DR-DOS 6, have you
heard any noises?  etc...

COMPUTER CENTRAL,
Went to College of DuPage (COD) last Sunday for Computer Central.  Pretty
nice dealer's show, run I think about every two months.  A friend bought
a new VGA monitor, I got "7th Guest" a highly recommended 2-CD game, but
I can't get it to work (actually now, I'm installing a new hard disk,
and NOTHING works.  The drive won't load ASPI drivers if the CDROM is
hooked up!

R/GENEVA,
Yeah, the tape is cute, no?  As for the function keys -- they're
programmable (in CONFIG).  They default to doing fairly inane CP/M
things like typing out PIP, ERA, etc, but you can make them much
more useful.  As I recall, you can embed CRs in the function key lines,
so that a single key can perform complex functions (for example, you
can have it call up the COMM program and set it to 19.2 kbps by doing
something like this:  B:COMM^MBD H^M.  It just stuffs the keyboard
buffer and off it goes.  Anyway, I guess the Geneva DID come with a
tiny slip of paper that used to fit in the window, but it was "user
oriented" -- blank in other words.  You could make one up to show how to
use the keys for the tape, I guess, but there IS a cryptic representation
of the keys at the bottom of the SYSTEM screen as well...

CYRIX 486/40 ??,
Has anyone had experience with the Cyrix 486/40 ??  Apparantely, it
is a 486/sx 40 MHZ chip to start with and the math co-processor plugs
into the top of the chip ( you remove the heat sinc, plug it in and then
put the sinc back on top)??  this sounds weird, and at least froma marketing
standpoint a little deceiving.	I was told it was 100% the same as an Intel,
vs. the ability to look the same.  With the math co chip it it very little
difference in price.

R/CYRIX 486/40 ??,
  Oh, this whole non-Intel chip thing is CONFUSING!  IBM comes along with
"Blue Lightning" which I thought was a 33-100 chip, possibly without a
math-co, and possibly a 16MB-addressing machine.
  Cyrix had 386-pin-compatible 486s, I think - and also other products.  This
one you talked about with the piggy-back math-co sounds strange!  One of
the bennies of Intel is the internal 64-bit path to the math-co, wonder if
that is true with Cyrix?
  Have you or anyone seen any reviews of the Cyrix chips?
load ASPI drivers if the CDROM is
hooked up!
