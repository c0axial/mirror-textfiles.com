R/LINE FEEDS,
  heh, looks like you don't have an MNP modem.	Come in at 2400, and
with MNP, you shouldn't have line noise...
  I noticed CBBS is getting NO CALLS at anything other than 2400.  I see
the codes coming in correctly for other speeds, but I'll bet Randy set
the switch on the modem for "fixed speed", so even a 1200 baud call is
coming in at 2400 to CBBS.  When CBBS switches to 1200, that hoses things
up.  Hmmm.

R/LOOKING FOR A JOB!,
Actually wrong subject - in the log you asked about Randy's chinet system.
The guest # is (312) 283-0559.

APOLOGY-CBBS DOWN,
CBBS was down for 14 days due to a total re-arrangement of "chinet
headquarters" i.e. where Randy runs CBBS and chinet.  Sorry for the
outage.  Thanks for coming back.

R/KODAK PHOTO CD,
  Found the following on a Compuserve msg reply:
You need a program to view the discs.  Photoshop and Corel are two
examples.  Without these, you need the Photo-CD Access program from
Kodak.	Call 800/224-2424 for info, or check with local retailers.

PHONE LINES,
Your question about X.25 brought up a peripheral question. Do bulletin boards
use half duplex or single duplex lines? If the boards do not make outgoing
calls, they can get the half duplex service. It is a small economy that can
add up over time. Do you know if sys ops use this option?

DIGITAL MODEMS,
is you think X.25 is a little scary... try 'digital modems'
this is the technology used by some credit card verification systems that
have the card swipe read and transmitted via originating modem to a 'digital'
device the looks at the T-1 bit stream (on one of the 24 or more channels)
and decodes the bit stream directly into data without converting to analog
and then passing the analog stream into a modem.
Another Digital Signal Processing technique is used to combine FAX data -
which of course is just V.29 9600 bps data streams into a mux for remote
office connections.  Instead of chewing up 64kbs of a analog voice channel,
the mux merely carves out 9600 for the real fax data, and another 32kbs for
the compressed voice (or 16kbs, or even 8kbps) and leave the rest for any
kind of data.... so on a single 56k line, you get FAX, voice line, and data
.... neat huh ??

WINDOWS & OS/2 COMMUNICATIONS,DEAD
I am currently writing a Windows 3.0/3.1 communications program which was
initially to be used on my job (microwave radio tech) to communicate with
our HP1000 CP/M (LARSCAN 1000) alarm system. After successfuly completing
this portion of the program I decided to implement file xfer capabilities
in the program so that I could use it for all of my communications needs.
I have since been able to include XMODEM(Checksum)/(CRC) with excellent
results. I would be interested in any specific C or assembly examples of
ANY and ALL other transfer protocols. I may be reached via Compuserve Mail
through my user ID 72700,3275.
Also, I would be interested in any information or examples of Windows code
implementing serial or parallel communications. I have the terminal example
written by Brian Woodruff of Microsoft, but this example does not include
any mention of file xfer protocols or switching between 7E1-8N1-7E1.The
particular problem that I am having in this respect is that after the file
is transferred successfuly and I switch back to 7E1 I can transmit from my
keyboard to the remote system but I can't recieve from the remote system.
I would appreciate any input from anyone on this problem or the above mentined
protocol examples. Thanks, M. Glenn Lewis, Las Vegas, NV
