               The Second Annual Greater New Haven BBS Awards
              From the editors of The New Haven BBS List, 1994
*****************************************************************************
Note
----
    Yes, we have reached the end of another year, and that means our
second awards ballots are ready to go out. Last year when I did this, it
didn't get much previous notice, and because of that was almost a complete
failure. :( So, just to make it fair, this year I'm starting a little early.
This file includes the categories, instructions for voting, a list of rules
for the awards (Hey, I have to regulate it somehow!), a description of the
"awards", and of course a printable ballot! So, good luck to all and happy
modeming!

Voting Instructions
-------------------
      To place your votes for the various categories, print out the enclosed
ballot, complete it according to the instructions included on it (I will try
to make them nice and simple for you), and snail mail the form to:

                        Brian Macfarlane
                        97 Sleeping Giant Drive
                        Hamden, CT 06518-2120
                        Attn : Awards
      
      Sorry I had to do it this way 'cause I know that everyone's gonna
complain about paying for the stamp, but since I don't have the time to read
through 50 gazillion emails on every different board I can call I have to.
It also prevents multiple voting. :)

Rules & Awards
--------------
     1) Each person may cast ONE ballot and NO MORE. If multiple ballots are
received, both ballots from that person and any further ones received will be
DISQUALIFIED.
     2) It is preferred that you use your real name when filling out the
ballot, but if you wish you may use your online handle. Your handle, however,
is REQUIRED for the ballot to count.
     3) Ballots received between September 1 and December 31, 1994 will be
counted. All others will be consciously disposed of. (recycled)
     4) Award Finalists, the top 5 vote getters in each category, will
receive a weekly advertisement in FidoNet CT_BBSADS for 1 month with their
BBS name, number, and awards finalled and/or won included in the ad. Award
winners will get in addition a custom-made ANSI to use on their BBS for
however long the sysop chooses to use it. (I promise the ANSI will be MUCH
better this year! :)
     5) In the First-year categories, the item must have started during 1994,
and must be at least 1 months old. Rollovers (If it started in 1994 and is
not yet 1 month old) will be allowed in the next year's awards, or included
this year with a minimum "write-in" vote of at least 25 in any one category.
Leftovers (Those that started in 1993 but are eligible this year) are allowed
in this years voting.
