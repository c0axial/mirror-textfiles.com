Ever heard of the information highway?  Yeah, me too, so many times that if
I ever hear some loser who can't tell twisted pair from Twisted Sister mention
it again, I'm going to run him down with my information Corvette!  The media
and the politicians have made this the rallying cry of the techo-wannabe's who
are flooding the 'Nets with thier crys of "Information for the people!"  
Hmmmm... haven't I seen that before?  Isn't that what the true hackers have
been crying all along?

Well, the techno-wannabe's are in for a big shock.  If they think that the
information highway is some electronic El Dorado and the Internet is its 
foundation, then they better prepare themselves for the worst.  The internet
was around a long time before they got their Macintosh Quadra 640 and bought
an issue of Wired.  And during that time, the 'Nets grew from isolated 
electronic villages into a raging data metropolis.  The media and thier 
worshipers have it all wrong, you see.  Calling the international data networks
a 'highway' is like calling Los Angelos the Santa Monica Freeway.  The Internet
is not just some bundle of copper, but rather the worlds largest city where 
thoughts fly around the world in seconds.  

These newbies logging onto the net for the first time are not much different 
than the farmhands who flocked to New York after World War II.  They don't 
have the first clue how sophisticated the established city dwellers are and
only have an inkling of what really takes place in its streets.  I think
Bruce Sterling said it best when he wrote:

"Things happen there that have very serious consequences.  This 'place' is not
'real', but it is serious, it is earnest... Some people became rich and famous
from thier efforts there.  Some just played in it, as hobbyists.  Others soberly
pondered it, and regulated it, and negotiated over it in international forums,
and sued one another about it, in gigantic, epic court battles that lasted for
years.  And almost since the beginning, some people have committed crimes in
this place."

So if the Internet is a city of millions, than there are bound to more than
just shiny skyscapers and hallowed halls of learning.  Every city has its 
dark allies, its seedy bars, its whore houses, its head shops, its gambling
halls, its adult bookstores, and its pawnshops.  And every city has its
self righteous police force who are just as likely to be found hanging out
in these places as they are to be busting them.  This is the high standard
which Corrupt Sekurity BBS strives for!

This bbs serves as a meeting place for those who desire to exchange information
and meet people who are more interested in how the system works (and how it
can be abused) than in where to find the latest Cindy Crawford gif.  This is
