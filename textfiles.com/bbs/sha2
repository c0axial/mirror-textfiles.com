Many bulletin boards across the nation have a huge amount of
software to choose from for download. Most have so many titles
that determining which ones might be worth the download time is
difficult. In this column, I will attempt to help you sort through
the huge morass of shareware available and let you know which
titles I feel are worth your evaluation. All the software reviewed
in this column is available on many bulletin boards throughout the
country. If you have difficulty locating a particular title, I
recommend that you contact its author at the address listed.

DRAG AND ZIP is a Windows shell for PKZIP and PKUNZIP. In that
brief description, it may not sound like much, but it is so very
easy to use that it falls into the category of "can't live
without" software.

Most of my days are spent entirely within Windows, and I often
am bringing compressed files form one computer to another. Until
I met DNZ, I had to exit Windows, change directories, run PKZIP
from the command line, and then bring Windows back up. NO MORE!
now, I simply double-click on a .ZIP file in the file viewer,
and DNZ will take care of making sure that the files all reach
the directories I want.

Zipping files up is equally easy. DNZ's zipping program sits,
minimized as an icon, and all that the user needs to do is drag
the files from the file manager and drop them on top of the DNZ
icon. A dialog box will ask for a file name and options, and
then it's taken care of.

Another nice feature of DNZ is that it allows the user to get
use of all the obscure command-line parameters that PKZIP
offers. Without DNZ, I would never use fast memcopy, EMS, 386
protection, or any of the other two dozen options I now use
regularly.

DNZ does require that you already have a copy of PKZIP, and it
will support the latest version (as of this writing:2.1g).

This may sound like a rave, and it is. I simply could not get
much of my work done as quickly as I do if it were not for Drag
and Zip. Its $25 registration fee is a pittance for the
heavy-duty functionality that it provides. If you haven't
downloaded this one yet, DO IT NOW!!!
