
Argus "Hackers" : Scraping the bottom of the barrel...

Okay, so here I am chillin' on Argus when this kid named
"Hackerboy" logs on.. Oh boy, I say to myself, isn't he cool?
Anyway, I was bored, so I figured I might as well harrass him a
bit, and ask him some questions, so, here is the interview with
this sucker.  

All the {} quotes are by me.

K=Kingpin
H=Hackerboy

*--*  04-02-92  -  15:24:18  *--*


K: So, tell me what your definition of hacking is.. 

H: Well, ppl who crack passwords, and enter places where they     
   know that the place there on traces, but they are so good that 
   they can avoid it, ppl who are quick with commands like on     
   UNIX and then there are ppl who hack programs, they mess       
   around with them, change them, make them do somthing else,     
   screw them up or turn them inot viruses {This kid is pretty  
   bright, eh?}

K: How old are you?

H: 13

K: How long have you had a computer?

H: Not long, my parents wouldnt buy me one for a long time, only  
   about 9 months

K: Why do you hang out on Argus all the time, and why do you want 
   to hack? 

H: Well I like to hang on Argus cuz {I'm a dork, and} there are 
   ppl to talk to alot of them about different things, and I want
   to hack because its very usefull, and you can get usefuil    
   records, and change them, may sund stupid but thats one of the
   main resons

K: Do you think you are cool because you want to hack?

H: Nope,, I just want to.

K: What kind of records and stuff like that do you want to get??  
   credit reports??
 
H: I'm not sure, but not any thing TOO illeagal {cause I'm a    
   pussy}

K: Who told you about hacking?

H: I dont know, i have know about it for a while, but if you mean 
   who taught me, I have a freind who hang on the internet, and   
   he hacks a little and also packrat 
   taught me a little

K: Who is the kid on the internet?

H: Well he goes...........why the hell should I tell you?

K: Just give me his handle, not his life story..

H: Fine hegoes by the handle of kngtut, or kingtut, on argus it   
   is kng i think {This Kingtut kid is fun to talk to, too.}

K: So what kind of stuff do you hack?

H: God, not very like hi security stuff, my self i dont do much   
   hacking, but soon i will have an account to the internet so    
   that will help, he (kngtut) just hacks low class stuff,        
   nothing big.

K: Does he know what he is doing?

H: Yeah sort of, he know how to handle a UNIX well his dad is     
   like a computer genuis, he makes all sorts of stuff, and even  
   he gets the new systems for mac, months before anyone else, he 
   help make them too. {This guys dad sounds cool!}

K: What boards do you guys call?

H: We dont call alot of places, not real hardcore hacking BBS     
   just the works, tavern, and this pyro board. no real BBS's {Oh
   shit Ferret, he said your board wasn't a real BBS.}

K: What is your handle on the works?

H: I think oh, no its......I'm not sure why the hell im telling   
   you this stuff but its um, ming i think

K: What do you think I am going to do, go to your house and rape  
   you?
 
H: Just cuz, i mean you might know the sysop, or be the sysop and 
   you might get me kicked off., im very paranoid {Kick this dork
   off, Ferret}

K: So what systems have you gotten into?

H: As i may remind you i am more of a program hacker, although I  
   am learning to hack, but i dont really know much so far.
 
K: Oh.. what is a program hacker?

H: I told you I screw with programs and change them, or put       
   viruses into them, if i want, i change the program and stuff   
   and in some games, i can take a saved game, like in kings      
   quest 5 and put my self at the end with every object, which is 
   fun. {So I can win lots of times! Yay!}

K: Oh.. by the way, how old is King Tut?

H: Hmm, around 12

K: So do you get a lot of copyrighted software (you and king tut)

H: Um, well you mean get it by buying it or pirating it? 

K: Pirating {What do you think?}

H: I gues not that much, but a little, he knows ppl who have      
   rights to hand that stuff out so most of it is legit {What the
   fuck does that mean?!} , i mean I have a copy of phototshop  
   that is like the companies compy, and way we pirate a little,
   like if i get a game i might let him copy it, if he gibves me
   a copy of his game, or same thing with programs and stuff

K: Do you guys make free phone calls?

H: Oh, do mean like you call but it like somplace that should     
   cost like 5 bucks an hour, but you do it so it costs 3 cents   
   an hour? {This kid doesn't even know what _FREE_ means!}

K: What do you mean? 

H: Well like there are some kinda programs, that can like let you 
   do that, or like tell you a special plan to do it, {Thats a  
   new one} but what did you mean by free phone calls?

K: Phone calls that don't cost anything.. {duh.}

H: oh wait i think i know what you mean, like where you call one  
   termanal and from that call another in another country, and    
   like it get billed to the firt temranal?

K: From a boneheads point of view, right.. do you know what a PBX 
   is? {Hey Genetic Mutation, no offense.. hehe}

H: well i think i've herd of it but i dont think i know what it   
   is

K: Oh okay.. do you know what a lamer is? {Eh eh eh}

H: No

K: Ask king tut.. he should know, he is one.. and so are you.. 
   do you know what phreaking is?

H: Freacking? {Freaking? Phraking? Preacking?}

K: Phreaking

H: Nooooooo

K: Do you plan on hacking until you get busted?? or mommy and     
   daddy tell you to stop?

H: I dont think i'm gunna hack places that can trace, i'm not     
   trying to undemind the goverment or anything

K: Oh.. would you ever use somebody elses credit card to get free 
   stuff? {This is dangerous stuff!}

H: No are you one of those "net cops"? like my freind was hacking 
   somthing minor and the "net cops" told him to knock it the     
   hell off or they'd cut his subscription {cut what            
   subscription? his cable subscription?}, you know those sort    
   of like really grouchy sysop types {Like Magic Man and Count 
   Zero!} who just hang aorund waiting to bust somebody.

K: Yeah right. Just stick to playing computer games.....

K: Do you think anything you or King Tut do could get you into    
   trouble?

H: Probabaly, not but theres slim chance but as i said, i am      
   still waiting for an account on the internet, but you cant     
   just guess at default paswords, you hafta get them from other  
   ppl, you cant just guess at the right addresseds, you have to  
   get them from ppl,

K: {Okay well its time to go, so...} Well buddy, that slim chance
   is here.. This is Agent John Ralfski with the Boston         
   Secret Service division of computer crime investigation,     
   and we plan on charging you with intent to break and enter   
   on computer systems, and aiding and abetting.

H: You cant bust me cause any screw ball could be using my        
   account and any way i have never hacked in my life, just my    
   freind {Good job, tell on his friends, too} . i said i might 
   hack.

K: {I feel like a genuine pig} Look don't tell me anything, tell
   the juvinile court judge. you are just wasting our time. now 
   will you cooperate with us, or are we going to have to go down
   to newton and make you?

H: What the hell do you want with me? i cant even use a computer. 
   i didn't do anthing, i swear

K: You are under arrest.

H: sG>8INwwww

I thought the end was kinda lame, but what the hell, it was worth
it.  Anyway, if you see this kid around, talk to him, you might
learn how to win King's Quest V without even playing it, and how
to make a $5 per hour call cost $.03 an hour!
