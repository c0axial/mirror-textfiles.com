                     MEBBSNet v1.0 highlights
                   -------------------------------
Fixes, and changes you can expect to see in MEBBSNet v1.0 are:
 
o DRASTIC reduction in executable size. The MEBBSNet executable is
  now under 270k vs. 380k+ for StarNet. (Possibilities are good it
  will shrink even further before release as fine tuning continues).
 
o DRASTIC reduction in the amount of system STACK usage. MEBBSNet
  only requires a 20k stack for operation (Down from 60k in StarNet).
 
o DRASTIC increase in execution speed. Sophisticated programming
  techniques and removal of 'busy loops' have resulted in incredible
  speed increases in system operation.
 
o Removal of all Enforcer and MungWall problems. The software has
  been converted to TRUE 32bit base-relative addressing, and uses a
  'vanilla' compile (no switches needed at compile time).
 
o All Date handling code rewritten from the ground up for proper
  operation.
 
o WorkBench v1.3 Compatable.
 
o Complete new file transfer protocol operation. Existing file 
  transfer protocols have been completely removed (and subjected to a
  horrible, fiery death). XPR protocols are now used for file 
  transfers, and are Sysop configurable via an included GUI utility. 
  There is no hardcoded limit to the number of XPR's you may use. 
 (Hooks are in place to allow XPR protocols to be configurable by 
  accesslevel in v2.0)
 
o Libraritized Task Management system keeps memory usage to a minimum
  while maintaining a secure and stable environment.
 
o 3rd Party Developers Library and programming support
  (MEBBSutility.library). Developers are furnished full library
  information, example code, and complete documentation in 'autodoc'
  format.
 
o 3rd Party Developers are assured upwards compatability with new 
  releases of the MEBBSutility.library. No more recompiling when a new
  version is released. If it works under MEBBSNet v1.0, it will work 
  under future releases.
 
o Graphic User Interface (GUI) utilities for Editing system 
  configuration, Users, and Files (MEBBScfg, MEBBSue, MEBBSfl).

 
MEBBSue (User Editor) feature highlights:
------------------------------------------
Hotkey launch from BBS screen.
Find New users
Add new users
FAST searching. Point/click search ability on upto 2 fields at once.
Ability to delete user(s) waiting mail file.
Full report generating capabilities w/definable path:filename.

 
MEBBScfg (System configuration) feature highlights:
----------------------------------------------------
Hotkey launch from BBS screen.
Full report generating capabilities w/definable path:filename.
Changes made are updated immediately, not just upon exit.
Full point-n-click operation for adding file/message areas, 
access levels, and all system paths.
 
MEBBSfl (File Area Maintenance) feature highlights:
----------------------------------------------------
Hotkey launch from BBS screen.
Built-in Help. Ability to 'localize' language used for Help functions.
ARexx port.
Adopt/OnDisk functions for adding/removing files.
Check/Change file extensions (great when using re-archivers)
Filenote files with short descriptions.
Kill/Move/Rename/Edit file functions.
Update file information (size, etc.)
Sort existing files in file catalog.
Fully configuable filelist generation via Point-n-click or Arexx.
Includes all aspects of file catalog entries such as uploader,default
description, <Free Download>
All features are configurable to operate on either individual file
areas or on a global basis.
Full report generating capabilities w/definable path:filename.
 
o Support for alternate character sets.
o Full Internal ASCII string configurability. This includes not only
  the text itself, but also the Menu Command letters.
o Sysop-definable font for bbs screen(s).
o Serial I/O has been rewritten from the ground up with an eye on
  stability and speed.
o Support for 16,800, 19,200, 21,600 bps modems and ISDN lines.
o NEW Modem Compiler.
o NEW Menu Compiler.
o NEW ARexx port (with MORE features).
o NEW Nodelist Compiler (MEBBSnlp) is full-featured and FAST.
o CLI Door support.
o Emulator for running existing StarNet doors (games).
o NEW Line-oriented Message Editor 
o Line Editor has the ability to upload a message from disk and dump
  a message to disk (or printer).
o All file I/O code rewritten. (No more 'lost' files.)
o Internal File Indexing routines rewritten using linked-lists.
  ReIndexing now is fast (system dependant) as well as easy on the
  CPU.
o Support for alternate 'FrontEnds' rewritten for proper operation.
o Internal FrontEnd now supports EMSI. EMSI is sysop configurable 
  (On/Off) and will properly fall-back to YooHoo (then lotek) if it 
  fails to get an EMSI connect. Support for 9 (nine) network addresses. 
  Addresses now use a common inbound/outbound area. No more multiple
  inbound/outbound directories!
o NEW Tosser/Packer (MEBBStoss), is 5x faster than the previous
  Tosser/Packer. MEBBStoss supports 4-D Addressing, FidoNet 2.2 packet
  headers, and Packet-level passwording. Exports conform to Fidonet
  2.0 message standards.
o MEBBStoss has the ability to generate a report on your mail areas 
  for debugging purposes when setting up FidoNet.
o Packet-level passwords are Sysop configuable for inbound mail, 
  outbound mail, or both.
o Mail packets are processed in chronological order. No more reading
  replies before the original.
o Poll packet generation can be done on a z:n/n.p basis, or use the
  Call_<line>.ctl file to generate multiple poll packets at once.
o Tosser/Packer has the (Sysop definable) ability to auto-create new
  echomail areas as they are received.  MEBBStoss generates E-Mail to 
  Sysop with full stats on the area(s) created. MEBBStoss auto-updates
  the Areas.cfg file with the new tagname(s) for reduced Sysop 
  maintenance requirements. Path to new message areas is configuable.
o EchoMail security features abound (even with nodes you already
  connect to). Network connections and mail processing now have
  security features which are several orders of magnitude above that  
  which existed previously.
o Netmail routing as Originator or Passthru.
o Point.CTL file removed. All point information is contained in 
  Areas.CFG and is listed in 4D format.
o PassThru.ctl removed. All Passthru information is contained in 
  Areas.CFG. PassThru areas do not need a message base 
 (or any other directory space) on your system other than the space 
  the outbound (passthru) mail packet(s) will occupy.
o Tagnames are no longer tied to a particular messagebase #. If you
  move a messagebase from one area to another, Areas.CFG no longer 
  needs to be modified.
o MEBBStoss has a RESET commandline switch to auto-update all high 
  message counters automatically.
o .TIC files are deleted upon sucessful transmission. Reduced 
  maintenance for those who Hub in file networks is a result.
o Netmail/Fido File attaches now can use complete Path:To/Filename in 
  .FLO files for both convienience and space savings.
o Event handling completely rewritten. The old problem of a user 
  getting shorted daily time because an upcoming event was near is no 
  longer a factor if the next event also allows callers (MEBBSNet 
  will execute the script(s) in the background). 64,000 (sixtyfour 
  thousand) scripts supported for your convienience. Flags for start
  of event script, fidoin, fidoout, and user logoff. Also configurable 
  are file requests, crashmail, mailonly, and nonetwork. If NoNetwork
  is selected, the bbs will not display the 'Press Escape' prompt, and
  go directly to the Welcome screen. This has been added for those 
  systems who do not belong to any network(s).
o NewUser Login has been rewritten for more logical operation. The old
   problem of a newuser entering an existing handle no longer dumps
   them back to the beginning.
o NodeList search function rewritten for proper operation. Display has 
  been reorganized to show Net address, system name, and phone number.
o MEBBSbase now removes 'holes' (deleted file #'s) from the filebases
  upon initialization (aka 'NOGAPS'). A CLI/Shell utility is supplied
  (CleanCatalog) to automatically remove duplicate filenames from your 
  file areas. CleanCatalog generates a batch file which (if executed) 
  will also delete the files themselves.
 
o General reorganization of the system for more logical operation. For
  FidoNet(c) systems, Areas.cfg now handles 4-D Addressing, Passthrus,
  and tagnames.
o All user-configurable text files (.ctl) now reside in the
  MEBBSnet:Configfiles directory. A Sysop now need only look there to
  find configurable textfiles. 3rd party developers are encouraged to 
  use this reorganizational change for their utilities also. Binary
  configuration files are located in MEBBSNet:S
o Log files now are more descriptive and consistant. This will allow
  for 3rd party utilities for billing, and other things that rely
  upon system logs for operation to operate easier and with greater 
  efficiency.
o Modem Dial-out functions have been completely rewritten.
o New miscellaneous CLI/Shell utilities include:
 
BBSStringParse Compile ASCII strings within the executable into binary.
BBSStringDump  Take bbs stings (binary) file and dump to ASCII
CheckEvent     Returns information about current running event.
CleanCatalogs  Remove duplicate filenames from file catalogs. 
               Generates script file that can be edited and executed
               to remove duplicate filenames themselves.
DinkyRobo      WB2.0 GUI message posting utility.
FrekIt         Generates list of file-requestable files. Supports
              'magicnames' include file, ability to remove file
               extensions from requestable names, attach passwords.
KillEmpty      Kill any file listed by AmigaDOS as <Empty>
ProtocolConfig WB2.0 XPR protocol configuration.
NLSearch       Find a node in the nodelist.
ReScanStrings  Edit BBS ASCII strings, recompile, then use this 
               utility to make MEBBSNet aware of the new changes.
TestMessage    View message headers.
TestPacket     View Fido packet headers.
TestRoute      View Fido routed netmail.
ShowModemDat   View compiled Modem_<line>.Dat file as MEBBSNet sees it.
 
o This is not to mention the dozens of little changes and refinements
  to remove backwards logic in things that worked before.
o Eight Support Site systems available 24 hours a day to registered 
  users. Four are located in the United States, 1 each in Australia, 
  Denmark, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. All are available via 
  FidoNet(c) and some are available via alternate networks.


o Software Upgrade Fees, MEBBSNet v1.0:
 
Registered StarNet licensees: NO CHARGE
 
o Documentation Upgrade Fees, MEBBSNet v1.0: (Not set at this time)
 
A completely new manual will be made available upon release. Due to
printing costs, it will be made available at our cost (We are NOT in
the manual selling business!). Cost has not been determined at this
time, and will be set after quotes have been received from printers.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCT: XENOLINK 1.90
------------------------------------------------
Next Generation Professional Bulletin Board Software 
Copyright (C) 1990-1994 Xenomiga Technology
Available: March, 1994


The principle upon which Xenolink has been designed:

"If a QuickSort in C is faster than a Bubble Sort in Assembly Language,
then let Xenolink be the QuickSort in Assembly Language."

Xenolink's efficient new architecture is now faster and more compact
than ever.

The changes are obviously far too numerous to list, but a brief
synopsis of the areas affected is listed below:

- Attractive AmigaDOS Release 2 interface
- Vastly enhanced security features
- Improved door support
- Completely redesigned FidoNet support
- Decrease in the already low usage of memory and disk space
- Even faster operation than before

Xenolink 1.90 has been tested as never before, by countless beta
testers with setups ranging from Amiga 500's to 4000's, 68000's to
68040's, CD-ROMs, FAX-Modems, HST 16.8k modems, Point hosts, Network
hubs, multi-line systems - the list goes on.

- Mature software; large amount of third party Xenolink software
  available.
- Large private support network linking together hundreds of Xenolink
  owners with Xenomiga Technology.


Base Software Architecture
----------------------------
- Xenolink Resource Handler controls access to all Xenolink resources.
- Avoids unnecessary disk activity if a resource (such as a message.
  base or file area) is in use by more than one process.
- Crash protection; if a door crashes or hangs a Xenolink node, system
  data files and log files are preserved, even on the node that
  crashed.
- Automatic resource preloading enables Xenolink to asynchronously
  open files before they are required, thus reducing the bottleneck
  caused by disk activity.

 
MEMORY USAGE
--------------
- Dynamic memory and resource allocation
- Xenolink and its accompanying utilities are residentable
 (extremely low memory usage for multiple nodes)
- Extensive use of xenolink.library shared library routines
- All executables are very compact (needless compiler overhead
  eliminated)

 
DISK SPACE USAGE
------------------
- Two files per message area, for unequalled speed and compactness
- Three files per file area
- Compact user data files
- Real-time data compression used on compiled nodelist
- Xenolink's compact data files have numerous advantages:
     o Very high speed operation due to the small number of files used
     o Minimises disk fragmentation
     o Data files are easily archived
     o Makes backing up very easy (very few files to back up)
 
SPEED
-------
- Very fast implementation of fast algorithms (both are important!)
- Enhanced Global Quick Indexing (EQDX) algorithms enable virtually
  instantaneous location of any file catalogue entry or user.
- Written in C and assembly language, using SAS/C Version 6
- Any area requiring speed has been written directly in assembly
  language; this includes:
     o Screen/modem i/o
     o Mail processing parsing and i/o
     o Searching
     o Sorting
     o Hashing
     o Semaphoring
     o CRC checking

- Only a few assign statements required.
  o Xenolink does not require you to add countless assign statements
    to your startup-sequence
  o Location of all directories specified in "dir.config" file

- Separate configuration files, stored in a single directory:
  o General/global configuration options
  o Node configuration
  o Message bases
  o File areas
  o User access templates
  o Bulletins
  o Archivers
  o External protocols
  o BBS text 
  o BBS entry points
  o Access restrictions

- FidoNet configuration files stored in a separate directory:
  o Node security (password, default protocol, archive type,
    send type)
  o Nodelist configuration
  o NetMail routing and forwarding
  o EchoMail area configuration (origin lines, feeds, passthrough
    are as)
 

DOOR SOFTWARE SUPPORTED:
-------------------------
- Full CLI door support
  o Any program that runs in your CLI (shell) can be run as a door
  o Does NOT require the use of fifo.library or custom handler files

- DOS Shell feature allows the CLI shell to be run within Xenolink
 
- AREXX interface
  o Complies with the ABBEREXX door standard
  o Supports many commands used by other BBS programs
  o Many Xenolink specific commands
 
- Can run many Paragon/Star-Net doors
 
- Xenolink doors run in the same task context as Xenolink itself:
  o Eliminates task context switching
  o Door interface provides direct hooks into Xenolink functions
 
- Xenolink's shared library (xenolink.library) provides an easy to use
  Object Oriented Interface for door programmers:

  o Complete access to users, messages, the file catalogue, system
    configuration, linked lists, node operations & tilde codes.
  o Doors may initiate file transfers, send messages to other nodes.
  o Doors which use the Xenolink library routines extensively are
    often as fast as Xenolink.
 
- Internal BBS commands can be replaced by external modules.

Brief Description Of Amiga Citadel BBS(also know as Citadel 68K)
------------------------------------------------------------------

Minimum System
----------------
Can be run on an A500 with 1.3 ROM and 512K with 2 floppies, but is
very limited.

Recommended System
--------------------
Any Amiga with 2.04 ROM or better, 20 MB  HD space, and 2 MBs or more
of memory.
 
Citadel is a FREEWARE BBS project that is supported on the Amiga, IBM,
MAC(although the MAC is inactive now), and Atari.
 
Citadel is a room-based system.  It is excellent for messaging.  The
basic organization is in floors and rooms.  While other BBS programs
have a message base as a secondary item attacked to the BBS, 
in Citadel it is the BBS.  Floors are a group of rooms.  Floors 
are a partitioning of the rooms into groups so that sysops and 
users can manipulate their view of the system(you can for example
forget a whole floor).  Think of floors as similar to conferences. 
The basic unit is a room. A room is a location of a conversation.
Messages are that conversation.  Most rooms will have a topic
(Like Amiga, MS-DOS, ect), some rooms can be shared with other
systems(networked).  Room-based systems like Citadle have an
extremely streamlined set of commands for fast access to the messages.


History Of Amiga Citadel
-------------------------
Citadel was created in Nov. 1981 from something called DandD.pas,
a Dungeons and Dragons an adventure game editor/driver It then was
substantially revised and made to run on a CP/M based system.
Somewhere around April to June 1985 is became Citadel-86 with
automatic networking.

Later, versions for the Amiga, Atari, and MAC were created by various
people along with other variants for the IBM. The source was public
domain and spreading like wildfile!  I have maintained the Amiga
Citadel since Jan 92 after complaining of bugs and was told by the 
current maintainer to put up or shut up...  I inherited the source 
and have since done additional ports from the IBM source.  Citadel is
not perfect or bug free, but all the major features work and it is
Enforcer hit free!
 

Basic functionality of Amiga Citadel
--------------------------------------
A Room is the basic unit.  it may be:
- Shared, networked with other systems on the C86Net, or even other
  networks(like FIDOnet, USENET) via external programs.
- Private, Public, Hidden, or Invitational.  Rooms default to public,
  with all users invited.  Hidden rooms are available to users if they
  know the name(a user tells the bbs to goto the room) after which it
  is public to them.  The Invitational rooms are private and the room
  moderator must invite them to the room.
- Anonymous, where there is no user identification as to who posted the
messages.  This is great for door games where users can create their
own identification using their door names.
- Directory, where a sysop or aide can attach a directory for uploading
and downloading of files.  Files have a short and long display format.
Users can not only up and download files, they can examine the contents
of archives, extract and download just one file!  Citadel has a powerful
command set.
- Doors may be attached to a room or globally accessable.  Citadel uses
a stdio door interface and can run many popular door.  The interface is
flexible enough that you can run any program that runs from a cli shell
window. Citadel comes with a full set of documentations, help files for
the user, and both a 68000 version and a 68030/20 version.  Included in
the documentation is a list of about 100 systems in Canada and the USA
that are on the C86Net so you can call and ask questions.  All required
files can be found on the Amiga Zone BBS (609) 953-8159 along with door,
external protocol and archives information.


CLOSING
---------
Citadel comes with several large documentation files that detail all the
inner workings of the configuration file and the BBS setup.  Much of
this is the IBM documentation, but there are Amiga specific files.
 
Citadel is FREEWARE and may not be sold.  It may be distributed with any
hardware or software collection so long as no charge is made for it.

Commercial use of Citadel may only be made to the extent that a BBS is
being run.  Pay BBSes must get prior approval from the authors or
current maintianers before charging users for access.
