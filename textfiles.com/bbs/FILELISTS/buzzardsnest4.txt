The menu's still func-            tion,   but there's no way to know which menu re-            places another.   As you can imagine, this can be            very bewildering.

Minitors            alternates between stealing pixels from the height            and width on successive startups, so the diminish-            ing screen size  doesn't affect the screen propor-            tions.  It takes a considerable amount of time be-            fore the loss is great enough to notice,  and pos-            sibly by then your victim will get used to working            in a one inch screen.

The frequency            of errors  is roughly one typo  for every  15 key-            strokes; just enough to be a pain, but not so fre-            quent to be obvious.  As the name implies, it's as            if your  victim is  wearing  mittens while  at the            keyboard. Have fun, Uncle Tom.MovodII     :  288k:Awesome 256 color game!

Your victim can open an exist-            ing document  and everything looks fine,  but once            they start typing at the keyboard,  things get in-            teresting.

This ex-                    citing  collection  contains over 145 EPS images  in                    both Color  and B&W,  covering  friendly  and  often                    humorous  observations on  various facets  of every-                    day life.   As featured in Tom Parker's book, "Never                    Trust a Calm Dog",  these images are as offbeat  and                    twisted in graphic style as in their  interpretation                    of situations. This upload covers disks 1 thru 3 and                    contains only the color images.

Have fun, Uncle Tom.Flo'132     :  211k:Wouldn't it be fun  to turn your boss  into a cone-            head?  Flo's freeform plasticity makes it easy by            turning any image into a stretchable plastic-like            surface. Unlike morphing, you only need one image            or part of an image,  to twist,  push,  pull, and            turn!    You can easily distort any PICT file and            export it to either a PICT,  TIFF, PIC, or Quick-            Time.  Graphic design professionals will appreci-            ate the many features and beginners will love the            ease-of-use. Have fun, Uncle Tom.Hitchcock10 : 1516k:Aldus Hitchcock 1.0 - A digital post production tool for            non-linear frame acurate video editing.

E.g. movie AJA-01 (a QT            blow job) was reduced by 175K, and QTXBJMAID2 (a REALLY            great blow job) was reduced in size by almost 300K.
