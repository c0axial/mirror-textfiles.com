           BIBLIOGRAPHY ON SCIENCE AND SPIRITUALITY AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS
             IN SCIENCE  WITH  IMPLICATIONS  FOR  POSSIBLE  VALIDATION  AND
                        ILLUMINATION OF ESOTERIC TEACHINGS
       -------------------------------------------------------------------

       I.  Suggestions for areas of inquiry and research topics
           (I realize that some of these suggestions you are familiar with
           some of these topics probably  even  all  of  them;I  am listing
           these in the hope that maybe some of these you  have not thought
           about).

         1.  Research  into  the  nature  and  effects  of light (different
             kinds) on living organisms.

         2.  Research into altered states  of  consciousness (in meditation
             etc) and finding biological indications of the effects of them
             on human physiology (changes in blood chemistry,hormone levels
             and activity,EEG  profiles,EKG  profiles,DC  readings  of  the
             skin,changes of chemistry,ionic activity of the cells (muscle,
             brain,blood, eye),electrical,chemical activity of the retina)

         3.  Studies on the effects of color on the human organism.

         4.  Investigation    into   the   nature   and   applications   of
             superconductivity for     the     purpose     of    developing
             instrumentation with  enough power to detect  subtle  energies
             and fields surrounding human body.

         5.  Investigation  into  the  work done on the nature of cycles of
             the human body and in nature.

         6.  Check the work that claims that the moon and planets have an
             effect on solar activity which in turn has impact on nature.

         7.  Necessity  for  background  knowledge  and  consultant  of  an
             illusionist,stage magician  for  setting up research  protocol
             for studying  "psychic phenomena" (clairvoyance,psychokinesis,
             telepathy,precognition,dowsing  etc).Scientists  have  trouble
             detecting fraud and trickery.You can check the  history of the
             Psychic Research   Society   in   England   and  its  American
             counterpart for voluminous accounts of trickery and fraud that
             scientists were unable to  detect  for  verification  of  this
             comment about scientists in this capacity.

         8.  Documentation of the effects of healing (the magnetic "occult"
             type; the transference of the divine love energy)into a human
             body, animal, or other organism. (Electrical, chemical changes
             and activity of the cells i.e)

         9.  Research into Homeopathy,Arya Veda,Chinese,Tibetan systems of
             medicine.

        10.  Research into the biological effects of sound and music on the
             human organism and in nature.

        11.  Record  effects  of  energies  on  organism  during  spiritual
             healing.

        12.  Documentation and study of the patterns of analomies in nature
             that scientists have reported in their respective journals.The
             physicist William Corliss has  been compiling this information
             in his Project SourceBook; several volumes  of which has been
             commercially published that I am aware of.

        13.  Research into the biological effects that structures built on
             the principles  of  Sacred  Geometry and other  systems  of  a
             sacred philosophical  approach  to  mathematics  might have on
             living organisms.

        14.  Study of synesthesia.

        15.  Documentation of biological  effects  of  meditation practices
             and their  graded  forms  and  tools on the human  body  (This
             project would  take  10's of years maybe even 100 to 150 years
             due to the developmental response  and  processes of the human
             organism to altered states of consciousness and  energies from
             higher states of awareness).

        16.  Independent  checking  of  the  "scientific" research that has
             been conducted  by  scientists   with   the   anthroposophical
             community at The Goetheium in Dornach,Switzerland,and  Emerson
             College in England.

        17.  Exploration   of   mathematics   of   dimensions,superstrings,
             projective geometry,fractal geometry.

        18.  Study of the biological effects if any that crystals have on
             the human organism (my guess  if  they  do;that  they  amplify
             certain spectra  wavelengths  of  energy  as   a   result   of
             concentrated thought  or radiated energy directed through them
             ((somewhat analogous  to  laser  with  the  light  being  made
             coherent through a crystal)).

        19.  Compile clairvoyant descriptions of reality,then check the
             descriptions that have the greatest number of  parts in common
             by comparing them with computer simulated fractal graphics.

        20.  Compile   numbers,calculations   from  different  branches  of
             science etc  and  observe the  repeating  patterns,logarithmic
             ratios arithematical  relationships  etc  between  them  (i.e.
             whole number ratios between elements in the periodic table and
             mathematical ratios of tones in music for instance)

        21.  Investigation into the work of Louis C. Kervran on the

                                      Page 2




             transmutation of elements in biological organisms.

        22.  Examination  of  the  texts  of  alchemy  for  the  purpose of
             duplicating the work and testing  the  results  for  medicinal
             uses which it is claimed occurs.

        23.  Document changes in brain activity and physiological changes
             when people under hypnosis are told to develop  hidden talents
             or exhibit clairvoyance etc.

        24.  Study the physiological changes of "recognized" dowsers when
             they search for water.

        25.  Explore the effects of tones and different types of music
             on plants,animals  and  human beings in terms of physiological
             and brain activity changes.

        26.  Observe the effects of negative ions on living organisms
             physiologically.

        27.  More   thinking   and   research   done   in   the   area   of
             interdisciplinary research in all fields of human  science and
             all the suggestions listed here.

        28.  Document the physiological changes over a period of time with
             the application of Hatha Yoga asanas and techniques for
             rehabilitation purposes.

        29.  Examination of physiological changes in REM state of sleep
             while being  exposed  to  different  types  of color,music and
             negative ion concentrations.

       II.  SOME SUGGESTIONS OF CRITERIA FOR DISCRIMINATION
            (offered in attempt that in the  event  these have not occurred
            to you they might possibly be of some value.Reject them if they
            don't hold true in your experience)

         1.  Occam's  Razor  about  seeking  simplest  solution  over  more
             complicated solution as far as I can tell still holds true.

         2.  Try  to  find  a  rational  explanation that fits the analomie
             before seeking a metaphysical  one.If the rational explanation
             is too cumbersome and complex then seek a metaphysical  one.(a
             dictum from a Medieval philosopher whose name escapes me).

         3.  The   more   sophisticated   the   approach  (in  a  spiritual
             discipline) the great the emphasis  (with  the  point that the
             differentiation is ultimately an illusion) on different states
             and stages of consciousness and "spiritual development".

         4.  The acid test for me anyway; wither or not there is some value
             in idea  or  school  of  thought,metaphysical  or  secular  is
             determining if  it works in light of historical precedence and
             application as well as the acid  test  of personal experience.
             Also whether or not the assumption(s) the idea  of  school  of
             thought is based on is rooted in a correct perception of human
             nature or reality.

         5.  Most esoteric models and diagrams of nature of reality are
             partial in their descriptive value and only in rare instances

                                      Page 3




             are to   be   taken   literally.   Most   diagrams  deal  with
             interpenetrating energies,phenomena,structures  and  levels of
             reality.

         6.  The analogy of the Venn diagram in relationship  to Set Theory
             in Algebra holds true in dealing with esoteric philosophy.Find
             and observe  the  points,observations  that  different schools
             have in common and you can be  reasonably sure the information
             that you  have  observed  them to have in common  is  free  of
             biases (cultural, psychological and conventional religious).

         7.  Different  systems  of  esoteric  thought  deal with different
             types of people with differing  inner  makeup.  For example,in
             the Eastern Schools of spiritual tradition;people  are assumed
             to need  more  mental  activity  (abstract)  and have physical
             temperaments that tend towards  lethargy.  All "public schools
             of spiritual  traditions"  can  only give one  the  tools  and
             guidance to  develop  one's  one inner resources (alignment to
             the soul,spirit and qualities  that are developed as a result)
             once that is achieved then there is no further  need for those
             crutches and cosmologies.

         8.  You might find Manly Palmer Hall's book "Words to the Wise" of
             value in my opinion (for what ever it is worth) the advice he
             offers is excellent.

         9.  Some   alternative  spiritual  traditions  have  a  structural
             approach to human nature and  the  universe,some  a functional
             one, some a combination of both approaches (which  in  my mind
             is the  most  integrated way to deal with human nature and the
             universe at large.

        10.  Another point for discrimination;if a person is following a
             valid spiritual discipline than they will find that there are
             "cues" for  discernment  in   determining   whether   or   not
             experiences of  altered  states of consciousness  or  "psychic
             experiences" are valid.

        11.  Another observation about spiritual disciplines and meditative
             practices might  be  of  value.If  an individual or a group is
             dealing with a "legitimate or  real" path they will experience
             cycles of purification which will involve the personality as a
             whole and its mental,emotional physical components.  Sometimes
             health problems can result (usual not serious  or permanent if
             one is following the discipline properly)

        12.  The study and use of symbols is one of the major techniques in
             any genuine spiritual discipline;symbols can have physical,
             emotional,mental and   "spiritual   effects".  Any  LEGITIMATE
             spiritual disciple while have  a  graded  set of symbols to be
             used at different stages of the practice of meditation.

        13.  An Important behavioral cue of a person who has achieved some
             "success" or  development in a mediational discipline  is  the
             fact that  they will not discuss it with another person unless
             the interviewer has "a need to know" (based on the fact that a
             person has to be in a position  and  have  the  need  for  the
             information that  could be imparted),the right  motive  behind
             the questioning (always the danger of the information being
             misused in application and practice etc) and the simple fact

                                      Page 4




             that a person who is in the process of becoming "mature".

        13.  One should also read Abraham Maslow's description of a self
             actualizing person.He has given a precise an accurate set of
             characteristics and  traits  of a person who is in the process
             of becoming  "mature"  in  a  spiritual  sense  (soul  infused
             personality).

        14.  Wholistic thinking involves among other things: consideration
             of the  consequences  of  one's  actions  to others,  society,
             nations, other  kingdoms of nature,thoughts,ideals,examination
             of issues, ideas from different  points of view,in addition to
             the tracing and reflection on the original meaning and origins
             of the terms, words, and ideas involved.

        15.  Some  key  points  to  remember  in  regards  to  science  and
             spiritual traditions  is that: science deals with the question
             how spirituality with the question why science concerns itself
             with the physical mechanism(s)  and the relationship of energy
             to them  in  nature,  spirituality  concerns itself  with  the
             consciousness and  the  relationship of nature and kingdoms of
             nature to a first cause and  its  manifestations  in  terms of
             quality of life in kingdoms of nature,for an individual versed
             in them  symbols  and  religious  images  are   a  descriptive
             language just as math is for a scientist.

       III.SCIENCE AND SPIRITUALITY

         A.  Anthroposophical  Community  (influence  of  Rudolf  Steiner's
             ideas)

                          summery of   Steiner's  ideas  on  topic  and  an
                          attempt to bridge  them  to what science knows at
                          the time.

             7.  Wilhelm Pelikan: The Secrets of Metals

             8.  Rudolf Steiner: The Boundaries Of Natural Science (Rudolf
                          Steiner's undergraduate   educational  background
                          was in  mathematics and physics  with  a  PHD  in
                          Philosophy and Mathematics. He made contributions
                          bridging the  esoteric  and  "academic  fields of
                          knowledge".  Most  of his contributions have very
                          practical use.

             9.  Rudolf  Steiner:  Problems  of  Nutrition (for whatever my
                          opinion is worth  to  you;I  can  vouch  for  the
                          accuracy of   his   perceptions   on   nutrition,
                          experimenting with  my diet over the years has to
                          my surprise given  at  least  for  me independent
                          confirmation of these insights on nutrition prior
                          to even making a study of Steiner's ideas)

             10.  Rudolf Steiner: The Study of Man outline of his views on
                          psychology of man.

             11.  George Adams & Olive Weischer: The Plant  Between Sun and
                          Earth.  Two  mathematicians  with  backgrounds in
                          physics and chemistry  make  an  attempt  to deal
                          with "etheric formative forces" and morphology of
                          plants through  Projective Geometry  and  use  of
                          physics and  other  tools  (how  successful  this
                          treatment is depends  on  how much background one
                          has in physics and spiritual insight.)

             12.  Rudolf Steiner had several lecture cycles devoted to the
                          interface between  physics  and   spirituality,as
                          well as  in  medicine and biology.I don't know if
                          they have been translated into English yet.

             13.  George Adams: Physical  and  Etheric  Spaces  carries  on
                          Steiner's insight    about    "negative     space
                          counterpart"of the  etheric  with  physical space
                          etc. Develops   some   mathematical  propositions
                          about nature of etheric realm and energies.

             14.  Ernest  Lehrs:  Man  or Matter a physicist's  attempt  to
                          bridge and reformulate science and the scientific
                          method with  spiritual traditions using Steiner's
                          ideas as a springboard.

             15.  Rudolf  Steiner:  Man   as   Symphony  of  Creative  Word
