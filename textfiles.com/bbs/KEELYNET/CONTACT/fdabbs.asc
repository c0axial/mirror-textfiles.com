                    FDA ELECTRONIC BULLETIN BOARD SYSTEM (BBS)
                                    USERS GUIDE

       WHAT IS THE FDA ELECTRONIC BBS?

       The FDA electronic BBS is an electronic newsletter provided free-of-
       charge by the  U.S.  Food and Drug Administration's Office of Public
       Affairs to professionals interested  in  FDA issues. All information
       is added to the BBS as soon as it is released.

       This free service replaces the commercially-provided FDA BBS service
       from British Telecom/Dialcom.  This new FDA BBS allows you to access
       the same FDA information, with the same options and the same results
       provided by Dialcom.   In  addition,  it  offers  a simplified  user
       interface and enhanced  features  not  available  from Dialcom.  The
       features, functions and benefits of  this  new FDA BBS are described
       in Attachment A to this Users Guide.

       This new service provides specific access to the  FDA  BBS  only and
       does not duplicate   the   generalized   Dialcom   Electronic  Mail,
       Electronic News Service or other  "for  fee"  Dialcom  services.  To
       continue those services,  please  make  separate  arrangements  with
       Dialcom or other providers.

       The BBS currently has available:

            o   New releases
            o   Enforcement Report (weekly recall list)
            o   Drug and Device Product Approvals List
            o   Medical Devices and Radiological Health news
            o   FDA Medical Bulletin
            o   Special section on AIDS information
            o   FDA Consumer magazine, index and selected articles
            o   FDA  Federal  Register  summaries  (available by subject or
                date)
            o   Answers arising from questions in news stories
            o   Congressional testimony by FDA officials
            o   Speeches by FDA officials
            o   Veterinary Medicine news
            o   Upcoming FDA meetings
            o   Import alerts
            o   On-line User Guide

       The BBS operates  on  a  multi-user  computer  in  the  FDA Parklawn
       Computer Center (PCC) at Rockville,  MD and is accessible 24 hours a
       day, 7 days  a week. For more information about the  FDA  Electronic
       BBS, contact the  FDA  Press  Office at (301) 443-3285. If technical
       support is needed, contact PCC at (301) 443-7318 during the hours of
       7:00 A.M. to 7:00 P.M. Monday thru Friday.

       If you enter your password incorrectly, the BBS will display:

            "Sorry.  Your password is incorrect.  Please try again."

       It will then re-prompt you to enter  your  password.   If  you enter
       your password incorrectly three times, the BBS will  disconnect your
       modem and you  will  need  to  re-dial  the  BBS.  Otherwise it will
       display the following menu of available topics:
