     _____________________________________________________________________

     UTCAT is the University of Texas at Austin General Libraries Online
     Catalog.  You can use UTCAT from most personal computers, using a
     modem and communications software to emulate any of several common
     terminals.  There is no charge for this access and you do not need a
     password.

          Two communications programs, KERMIT (for IBM PCs and
          compatibles) and MacKERMIT (for the Macintosh), are available
          from and supported by the Computation Center.  To get a copy of
          KERMIT or MacKERMIT, bring a diskette to the Center's
          Microcomputer Laboratory in FAC 29.

     1.   Start your
          communications program,      even parity   7 data bits
          using these settings:        1 stop bit    full duplex

          (For KERMIT:  Type "kermit" and press the <Return> key.  Type
          "set baud" and the baud rate you will use, and press <Return>.
          Then type "connect" and press <Return>.

          For MacKERMIT:  Double-click the MacKermit icon.  Pull it down
          to the Macintosh "Settings" menu and choose the "Communications"
          option.  Set the baud rate, and set the parity to even.  Then
          click the OK box.)

     2.   Dial one of these numbers:  (512) 471-9400  300 to 1200 baud
                                      (512) 471-9420  2400 baud modems

          (If your microcomputer is directly connected to the Computation
          Center's MICOM system you do not need to dial.)

     3.   After connection is made:

          * Press the <RETURN> key

          * When you see the prompt:  CLASS=, type UTCAT and press
          <RETURN>


                                      Page 1





          * When you see the prompt:   GO , press <RETURN> until you see
          the prompt:  ENTER TERMINAL TYPE:

          * Enter the appropriate type for the terminal your software is
          emulating using the following chart, and press <RETURN>

                   (Note, for best on-screen results, experiment
                   with any terminal type your software allows)

          * When you see the UT tower logo, type UTCAT and press <RETURN>

          * You will then see the option screen, offering the Online
          Catalog as well as other administrative information systems.


                      Using UTCAT with Personal Computers

          Follow the instructions on the option screen.

          * To print a screen or save a screen to disk, use the
          appropriate commands for your microcomputer and its software.
          Printing and saving must be done one screen at a time.

          Keyboard equivalents

          The UTCAT software is written for the TELEX terminals and uses
          certain keys that may not exist or may not work on your
          microcomputer keyboard.  Use the chart below, according to the
          type of terminal your software is emulating.

          To erase typing errors, backspace over the mistake, then use
          ERASE EOF to remove characters to remove characters beyond the
          cursor.  To backspace on a Macintosh, hold down the cloverleaf
          key while you type H.  On other keyboards, use the backarrow key
          to backspace or, if there is no backarrow, use CTRL-H.

                      Using UTCAT with Personal Computers

     Notes:

          1.  A slash (/) between characters denotes separate key strokes.
              For example, ESC/4 means to press the ESC (escape) key
              followed by a 4.  If there is no slash hold down the first
              key while you press the second.  For Macintosh keyboards
              without an ESCAPE key, use the tilde (~) key.

          2.  For an IBM PC running KERMIT version 2.29 or newer, the
              terminal type is MAC.  For KERMIT versions 2.28 and older,
              use terminal type VT52.

          3.  For and IBM 3101 use the <-| enter key until the UT tower
              logo appears; thereafter use <-, for a PC with 3101
              emulation, use <- until the UT tower appears; thereafter use
              <-|.
          4.  For ROLM 3270 Cedar use ERASE EOF; for 3270 Cypress use
              DELETE FIELD; and for 3270 Juniper use CTRL END.
