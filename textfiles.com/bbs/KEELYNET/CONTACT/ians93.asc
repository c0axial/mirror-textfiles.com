       International Forum on New Science
       April 16-18, 1993
       Stapleton Plaza Hotel, Denver Airport
       Denver, Colorado

       Dear Friend,

       We hope you will join us for a unique and important International
       Forum on Advanced Energy (IFAE).  This Forum will be the first of
       its kind and will be extremely exciting.  The conference is
       sponsored in part by the International Association of New Science
       that will help make the shift in science, technology, and health
       care a reality.

                    Maurice L. Albertson  -  Brian O'Leary, PhD
                                    Co-Founders
                     International Association for New Science

       Purpose for the Forum

       To gather open-minded researchers and leaders for scholarly
       presentations and discussions of theories, inventions, and research
       results related to the fields of Advanced Energy Conversion
       Technologies.

       To provide a constructive setting for interested participants, both
       novice and professional, to learn more about current thinking and
       research in Advanced Energy.

       To provide an opportunity for researchers to present research
       proposal plans along with a summary of their technical work to
       interested investors and venture capitalists in attendance.

       To provide a worldwide forum and continuing network for the
       presentation, discussion, and funding of New and Advanced Energy
       Technologies.





       To provide a time and place with a friendly and supportive
       atmosphere for constructive discussions and advancements in all of
       the Advanced Energy Areas.

       Definition of New Science

       New Science includes topics and phenomena which cannot be explained
       by traditional science and yet may have the potential for
       significant benefit to the health and conditions for humanity and
       the planet Earth.

       Definition of Advanced Energy Technology

       Advanced Energy Technology includes the theory, research,
       construction, and testing of advanced energy conversion devices.
       These devices include devices and systems that operate with a
       higher efficiency than used today, and include novel and advanced
       concepts where energy conversion may appear to be over unity.  As
       energy cannot be created nor destroyed, the source of potential
       energy used by such devices may be at present not understood.

       Papers and Proceedings

       Thirty six papers are planned to be presented at the conference
       during Saturday and Sunday, April 17 and 18.  A summary of each
       paper by each presenter will be included in the proceedings of the
       conference, which will be available at the beginning of the
       conference.  Each presenter will also have copies of his or her
       detailed research proposal for distribution upon request.  All
       authors have been selected and contacted by the Steering Committee
       for this Forum.

       Workshops

       In addition to the scheduled papers, a number of special workshops
       will be scheduled during Friday and Saturday evening, April 16 and
       17.  A selection from two to four workshops per evening is planned,
       with each workshop being 3 to 4 hours in duration.  Workshops will
       require an extra nominal fee to offset the expenses of the
       presenter.
