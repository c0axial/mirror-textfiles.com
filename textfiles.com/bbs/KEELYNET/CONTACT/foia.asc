                            How you can use it

    Since its adoption  by  Congress  in  1966, the FOIA has furnished
    previously unaccessible documents     relating    to    government
    activities and a host of bizarre actions carried  out  in the name
    of our government.

    Without this act,  we  might  never have known about the following
    actions on the part of various government agencies :

    -----------------------------------------------------------------
       The CIA   performed   "behavior    control"    experiments   on
       unsuspecting victims  during the Cold War, using  Americans  in
       prisons as   guinea  pigs  and  the  nation's  universities  as
       research centers.  The techniques  included  "mind-bending" and
       memory-erasing drugs.

       From more  than  1000  pages  of  previously   classified   CIA
       documents, the  CIA  was  forced to release a letter written in
       1949 by a CIA operative which outlined ways agents could commit
       murder without getting caught.

       These techniques for undetectable murder included deep-freezing
       the victim, X-raying them to death  and  strangling with a bath
       towel.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
       The FBI  circulated  a bogus newsletter in St.  Louis  in  1969
       containing smears  about  the  sex  lives  of area civil rights
       figures as part of a scheme to harass and discredit them.

       The FBI later claimed that at  least  two  civil rights figures
       were successfully  discredited by the bogus publication,  while
       another one was "destroyed."

       FBI efforts   utilized   harassment  and  disruption  of  black
       militant and leftist organizations.   One instance attempted to
       break up  a  black  leader's marriage by writing  a  poison-pen
       letter to his wife.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
       After President  Richard  M.  Nixon  was  forced to resign from
       office, he used his federal annual allowance of $150,000 to buy
       such items as electric golf carts,  telephone  taping equipment
       and a subscription to the Washington Post.

       Ironically, the Post had won a Pulitzer Prize  for  its reports
       on the  Watergate  scandal  which  eventually  took  Nixon from
       power.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
                                  Page 1
       Days after  the  suicide  of  Ernest Hemingway in the summer of
       1961, the FBI took notice of his  death by inserting a clipping
       of a hostile obituary into a thick file folder  it  had kept on
       Hemingway.

       The file  dated back to 1942 and showed how the U.S. Government
       considered Hemingway a subversive.   During his life, Hemingway
       was almost  paranoid  in  his  fears  of  FBI  harassment,  not
       entirely unfounded as the FOIA papers prove.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
       Both the FBI and CIA kept files on the Rev. Robert F. Drinan, a
       Catholic priest elected to Congress in 1970.

       An 18  page  CIA  dossier  included a review of a baccalaureate
       address Drinan gave in 1973  to  the  students  of  Sweet Briar
       College in Virginia.

       The file referred to his support of student protests  "over the
       Kent State deaths and the invasion of Cambodia."  It also noted
       that Drinan urged the abolition of all secret government files,
       including CIA files.

       The FBI  dossier  covered  81  pages and date to 1958.  At that
       time, Drinan was dean of the Boston College Law School and very
       active in civil liberties of southern  blacks.  There were also
       papers on war speeches he had given.

       Drinan finally saw his files from both agencies  by  using  the
       FOI Act in 1975.  Total cost for copies of the papers : $8.10.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    The FOIA has  been successfully used to gather formerly restricted
    documents on the following subjects :
      1)  EPA reports on cancer causing agents
      2)  Federal  audit  reports disclosing  sloppy  bookkeeping  and
          misuse of  federal  research  funds, involving  hundreds  of
          millions of dollars, by colleges and universities across the
          country.
      3)  Dangerous  biological  warfare tests conducted in 1969, less
          than 50 miles from the White  House,  where  Army scientists
          had sprayed   hazardous  zinc  cadmium  sulfide   over   the
          Cambridge, MD area in massive open air tests.
      4)  Massive  invasions  of  personal  privacy  and  civil rights
          through the use of unauthorized wiretaps and monitoring.

    Departments who are  known  to "collect"  information  for  secret
    files include :

          the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),
          the Federal Bureau of Information (FBI),
          the Department of Defense (DOD),
          the Department of State,
          the National Security Council,
          the National Security Agency (NSA)
          and the Secret Service.

    The above agencies do not preclude the military and  civil  police
    keeping forces from  FOIA  requests.  In fact, the FOIA gives "any
    person" access to  ALL  records  of  ALL  agencies,  unless  these
    records fall within one of nine exempt categories.


                                  Page 2
    Under these categories,  the agencies involved are permitted - BUT
    NOT REQURED - to withhold the information.

    You can make  an  informal  telephone  request  for  the  data  or
    documents you need.   If you fail to get a satisfactory  response,
    you can file a formal written request.

    Once you make  a  written request, the burden falls on the federal
    agency or the  government  to  promptly   provide   you  with  the
    documents or to show that they fall within an exempt category.

    When such a  written request is made, the federal  agency  has  10
    working days to  either  provide the information you require or to
    respond.  IF THE AGENCY REFUSES  TO  RELEASE  ALL  OR  PART OF THE
    INFORMATION SOUGHT, YOU MAY APPEAL TO THE AGENCY HEAD.

    If your appeal is denied or the agency again fails  to reply within
    20 working days,  you  have  the right to file suit in the federal
    court nearest you.  If you win the lawsuit, the judge would direct
    the agency to release the desired information, AS WELL AS ORDERING
    IT TO PAY YOUR ATTORNEY FEES AND COURT COSTS.

    The FOIA Act covers  all Federal  agencies  and  ever  government-
    controlled corporations such as the Postal Service and Amtrak.

    The agencies not covered by FOIA requests include  federal courts,
    Congress, the President  and  his  immediate staff.  The Executive
    Office is covered by FOIA requests.

    The nature of  the  documents include  papers,  reports,  letters,
    films, photographs, sound recordings and computer tapes.  In order
    to cover all your bases, you must accurately describe what you are
    looking for.

    Any U.S. citizen or foreign national can use the FOIA act, as well
    as any corporation, partnership or other legal entity.

    In the event you wish to stick with an informal telephone request,
    call the agency's  public  information or press office.   If  they
    turn you down,  call  the  agency's FOIA officer, letting him know
    that YOU WILL FILE A FORMAL REQUEST,  AS  WELL  AS  AN  APPEAL AND
    LAWSUIT if necessary to get the data or documents you want.

    Due to the large body of archival information, some  agencies such
    as  the  Defense or  Agriculture  departmens,  have  separate  FOI
    officers in their regional offices  and  various subdivisions.  If
    you know which region or office has the information you seek, send
    your request to that office.

    If you don't  know which federal agency has the records,  you  may
    have to send formal requests to several agencies.

    Your envelope must  clearly  state, "FOI Act Request" along with a
    letter sent by registered mail, with  a  return receipt requested.
    You should also make a copy of the letter for your records.

    The letter should first state that your request is  being  made in
    compliance with federal FOI Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.

    Next, describe as  clearly  as  you  can  what  material you want,
    including names, places and the relevant time periods.
                                  Page 3
    You should be as specific as possible about what you want.

    Also in your  letter,  state  that  you expect to be sent ALL NON-
    EXEMPT parts of the requested records,  as  well  as JUSTIFICATION
    FOR ANY DELETIONS.   To assist in clarification,  you  may  attach
    documents to further describe the subject of your inquiry.

    It would greatly  help  to  state  your  intention  to  APPEAL ANY
    DECISION WHICH THE  AGENCY MIGHT  MAKE  TO  WITHHOLD  THE  DESIRED
    INFORMATION.

    None  of  this is free, so be prepared to pay any  reasonable  fee
    involved in the search for materials you request.

    ASK  TO  BE  NOTIFIED,  preferably  by  telephone,  if  the  agency
    estimates the fee  to  exceed  a  certain  dollar  limit  of  your
    choosing.

    You may then decide if what you are pursuing is worth the cost.

    If you can  still get the information you want, you  might  narrow
    the scope of the search and/or the number of documents you want.

    In the event  you  are a journalist, researcher or author planning
    to use the information you get in a publication, ask the agency to
    waive or reduce search and copying  fees.   YOU SHOULD STRESS THAT
    THE DATA YOU ARE REQUESTING WOULD "PRIMARILY BENEFIT  THE  GENERAL
    PUBLIC."

    Waiver requests can  also  be  made  by  indigents  and non-profit
    groups.

    In many cases, you might find it  quicker and considerably cheaper
    to visit the  agency  and  ask  to examine the documents  you  are
    interested in, rather  than  having  them  copied and forwarded to
    you.

    To assist in your search, you might visit the reference department
    of your public  library to find  names,  addresses  and  telephone
    number of federal  agencies covered under the FOI  Act.   You  can
    also check the   federal  office  listings  in  your  local  phone
    directory.

    An excellent booklet is available from the FOI Service Center.  It
    includes sample letters, forms  and  a  directory  of  some  major
    agency FOI phone numbers and addresses.  It also  has a section on
    the Privacy Act.

    You can request  the  booklet by writing the : FOI Service Center,
    c/o the Reporters Committee for  Freedom  of  the Press, 1125-15th
    Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20005.

    The booklet also  includes  a  schedule  of fees charged  by  some
    federal agencies relative  to  FOI requests.  Many agencies do not
    charge fees, though most do.

    Search fees normally run from $4  to  $6  per  hour  for  clerical
    personnel and from $10 to $18 per hour for professional employees.
    Computer-time varies, but  can  run  from  $60 to  $80  per  hour.
    Photocopying is normally 10 cents per page.

                                  Page 4
    You may be  charged  search  fees EVEN IF FEW OR NO DOCUMENTS that
    you request are found.  Agencies  are  required to publish uniform
    schedules for search  and  reproduction  fees   in   the   Federal
    Register.

    If the event  you  decide  to  appeal  a  request  which is partly
    denied, it is often a good idea to  accept  what documents you can
    get and appeal the rest.

    The courts often  give  exemptions  on the response  deadlines  to
    certain agencies such  as  the  FBI, CIA and the Justice and State
    Departments because of the volume and backlog of the requests.

    You may negotiate with the FOI officer  by  telephone  to  prevent
    having to make a formal appeal.  You may also compromise  and  get
    some of the denied documents released.

    The nine exemptions for denial of an FOI Act request are :

       1)  national  security,  where  release  of records would cause
           "identifiable damage" to the nation
       2)  internal personnel practices
       3)  information specifically exempted  by  law - the "catch-all
           exemption"
       4)  trade secrets or other confidential financial or commercial
           information
       5)  inter-agency or intra-agency memos
       6)  personal privacy, including personnel and medical files
       7)  law  enforcement investigations, both current  and  pending
           files only
       8)  federally-regulated  bank reports - a little used exemption
           which limits  disclosure  of  sensitive  financial  reports
           which might undermine confidence in individual banks
       9)  geological and geophysical information - oil and gas wells

    Dear Sir:

         This is  a  request under the Freedom of Information  Act  as
    amended (5 U.S.C. 552).

    (Identify who you  are  writing  for and what you will do with the
    information.)

         I request copies of any and all directives, memoranda, letter
    or other records,  including  written   memoranda   of   telephone
    conversations, which relate to the establishment  of  programs  or
    plans concerning (whatever you are interested in) during the years
    of (from **** to ****).



                                  Page 5
         Previous documentation received under this act has dealt with
    (list if any previous FOI releases on this subject).

         (List specific  requests,  nature  of,  where, titles, people
    involved, time periods, specific information)

         In the unlikely event that  access  is  denied to any part of
    the requested records,  please  describe the deleted  material  in
    detail and specify  the  statutory bases for the denial as well as
    your reasons for  believing  the alleged  statutory  justification
    applies in this instance.

         Please separately  state your reasons for not  invoking  your
    discretionary powers to  release  the  requested  documents in the
    public interest.  Such  statements   will  be  helpful  to  us  in
    deciding whether to  appeal  an  adverse  determination,   and  in
    formulating our arguments   in   case   we  might  possibly  avoid
    unnecessary litigation.

         I/We anticipate, however, that  you  will  make the requested
    materials available to  us within the statutory prescribed  period
    of ten(10) working days.

         I/We also  request  that  you waive any applicable fees since
    disclosure meets the statutory standard for waiver of fees in that
    it would clearly be "In the public interest because furnishing the
    information can be considered as  primarily benefiting the general
    public."

         I/We await your prompt reply.

                                               Your Name
                                               Your location or office
                                               Your group or title
