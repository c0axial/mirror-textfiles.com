       This file was put together from two messages on KeelyNet by Monsieur
       Guy Resh.  As  noted,  the  first  part  lists  some  of  the papers
       presented at the 1991 conference.   The  second  part  is  a partial
       listing of the papers to be presented at the San Diego conference in
       July of this year.  We will update the file fully on  receiving  our
       info from the organizers.  Thanks GUY!!!

                       (The following info paraphrased from
                         Extraordinary Sciences III/4...)

          Each year in August, an international conference is held to
       discuss the status and future plans of energy conversion devices.
       The conference, entitled    the   Intersociety   Energy   Conversion
       Engineering Conference (IECEC), is supported by all seven of the
       major engineering societies in the U.S..

          In 1991, a new topic area was introduced into the conference:
       Innovative and Advanced Applications.  Its purpose was to include
       summary papers of theoretical and experimental advances that have
       been made in the Tesla related and free energy fields.

          Last year's (1991) conference  was  in  Boston, Massachusetts and
       the 1992 conference will be held in San Diego, California  on August
       3-7.  Contact Pat  Bailey  (chairman) at P.O. Box 201, Los Altos, CA
       94023 for details.

          Anyway, Mr.  Bailey  reviewed  the  conference  in  Extraordinary
       Sciences which is what prompted me to travel far and  wide to obtain
       copies of the 30 (approx) papers that were presented.  The following
       is a list of them for those interested:

       ...and that's all :) - I'd recommend trying to locate  the  6 volume
       set (volume 4  contains the above papers) for the '91 proceedings as
       the 180+ pages was worth the money (to me at least).  Also check out
       Bailey's review.

       For those interested  in  attending the 1992 IECEC conference in San
       Diego, CA this  year,  here  are some  additional  details  which  I
       obtained today:

       Atlanta, GA (1993), Monterey, CA (1994) and Orlando, FL (1995).  The
       registration fee for  the entire conference  (not  just  alternative
       energy) is generally  in the range of $250-$275 which  includes  the
       printed proceedings (multiple volumes) and "coffee" :).
