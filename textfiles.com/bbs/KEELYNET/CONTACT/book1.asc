        The author  beleives that many UFO's are biological entitys and are
        often invisible to us.  He does NOT  say  all UFO's are biological.

        research has  been  done  in Italy.  The book is Paperback with 488
        pages, 42 pages of photographs.   There  are  21  chapters  plus  3
        Appendixes.  Interesting is his words to the effect that scientists
        are often  narrow minded when confronted with new  concepts.   Said
        scientists often will not give a new concept a fair hearing.

        Book on  the  alleged  Navy experiment to make a ship invisible; to
        radar or optically or both.  Supposedly  the  ship  not only became
        invisible but  dematerialized  and  rematerialized   at  a  distant
        location, then    re-materialized    at   the   original   location
        (Philadelphia Navy Yard).  Plus there  were  severe side effects to
        the crew  members.  Some of the crew were said to have  disappeared
        into another dimension.  Some never to return.
        Chapter 9  (The  Unexpected  Key)  is  very  interesting because it
        describes an interview with a scientist who was involved with the

        35 pages,  stapled  photocopy.  Paper  presented at the Intl. Tesla
        Symposium (1986) Classifies Non Conventional  Energy  Technology as
        rotating or stationary with subdivisions.  One section  is  devoted
        to common   misconceptions   regarding  power  measurement  ,  load
        impedance and storage batteries.   This  paper  should  provide the
        basic tools  and techniques necessary for the average  experimenter
        to measure and characterize Non-Conventional Energy devices.
