                      SAN FRANCISCO TESLA SOCIETY NEWSLETTER
                      700 Earl Street San Francisco, CA 94124
                           Volume I Number 3: March 1990

       MARCH MINUTES

       About 20 of us met at the Earl Street warehouse on Sunday 11 March
       1990 at 1  PM.  The membership dues were discussed. For new members,
       the total annual dues are $30: $5 to San Francisco Tesla and $25 to
       International Tesla. For continuing  members,  the total annual dues
       are $25: $5 to Local and $20 to International. If you are interested
       in membership, please refer to "Membership Information."

       We convened at  1  pm and continued until almost 6  pm  with  people
       coming and going in between those times. (How time flies when you're
       having fun!) We   had   a   Lakhovsky   Multiple   Wave   Oscillator
       demonstration by Tom Helke and a  video  on  Tesla  weaponry  by Tom
       Bearden. Lively discussions  followed both presentations.  Lakhovsky
       Multiple Wave Oscillator.

       The meeting began  with  Tom  Helke's  sparkling  demonstration of a
       turn-of-the-century electrotherapy   device   called   a  "Lakhovsky
       Multiple Wave Oscillator"   (MWO).  Tom  has  been   interested   in
       alternate healing techniques for years and the MWO is an outreach of
       that interest. To  receive  a  "treatment," you sit between two flat
       antennas which produce  an  electromagnetic   field  of  therapeutic
       energy.

       Last summer, he hacked together the device from spare parts which
       included beer and sarsaparilla bottle capacitors, aluminum foil and
       acryllic antennas, a  car  ignition  coil, a hand-wound,  oil-filled
       Tesla coil with  a rotary spark gap. Everything was constructed from
       scratch and was based on a modern  design  originally devised by Bob
       Beck and later modified by Klark Kent.

       The MWO was conceptualized by George Lakhovsky who  was  a  Russian-
       born engineer residing  in Paris. He was interested in various forms
       of electrotherapy and  believed   that   electromotive  force  (emf)
       broadcast at multiple frequencies would have a curative effect.

       Lakhovsky postulated that  the  energy  field  resonates   with  the
       "twisted filament" (which  is  like  a  "tiny  oscillator")  in  the
       neuclei of living cells. Thus, the  cell can act as a transmitter or




       receiver of radio-electric    waves    that   are   energizing   and
       revitalizing. With Tesla's help, he  constructed the MWO in the mid-
       1920s. It received U.S.  patent #1,962,565 in 1931.

       Lakhovsky died in 1942. The patent expired in 1951  and  is  now  in
       public domain. Since,  MWOs'  and  similar  devices  have  been used
       extensively in therapy clinics throughout Europe. Americans continue
       to "experiment" with MWOs' which have been documented to be of value
       in treating cancer, arthritis, and other illnesses.

       Four people sat for an electrotherapy experience. Three stated they
       felt a distinct energy field; one  said  he  felt  both  calmed  and
       energized; and another  said  he  felt  nothing.  The  MWO  will  be
       available for demonstration  at  April's meeting.  The Multiple Wave
       Oscillator is another example of Tesla technology and it generated a
       high degree of interest at the meeting. Such presentations are ideal
       for our group because they satisfy  the need for hands-on experience
       of the theories and inventions of Nikola Tesla. For more information

       TOM BEARDEN VIDEO

       In a two hour video, Colonel Tom Bearden spoke in great detail about
       Tesla weaponry developed   by   the   Soviets.   Apparently,    with
       applications of "scalar  wave  interferometry," entire cities can be
       shielded from the most intense military  attacks.  A globe of energy
       can be made  to  cover  a  sizable geographic area so  that  planes,
       missiles, armies cannot  enter, but are disintigrated by the wall of
       light upon contact.

       Soviet attack weaponry employs like  principle  in that scalar waves
       are pointed towards a specific area of the globe or  to a photograph
       (!) of the area or object and instantaneous destruction takes place.
       Bearden cited the devastation of the Trident submarine as an example
       of the work of the Soviets and their Tesla weapons.

       He used color  illustrations  (no  photographs)  to help clarify the
       points he made, but the talk was very technical in nature and left
       many of us in the dark. Discussion that followed indicated that, if
       such things are  possible,  why hasn't  Bearden  given  us  physical
       evidence of such claims.  Bearden goes into greater detail about his
       claims in his  books  on  the  subject. He seems most  dedicated  to
       disseminating knowledge of the more extreme applications of Tesla
       technology, but, then  again,  there's  that  query  ... where's the
       proof?

       Tesla devised similar kinds of area  protection  shields  and avowed
       such weaponry, but it was all in the planning stage and, as history
       proclaims, was not developed further.

       EDITORIAL

       At every one of our meetings, we have had attendees expressing




       skepticism toward some of the claims made by "Tesla Scientists." In
       future publications I  am  sure  more  controversial  material  will
       appear.

       It is ever the fate of people who  deal  with  the  cutting  edge of
       science to shed  or wade in a little blood. As a Tesla  supporter  I
       certainly expect it  to  happen  to  me.  I  share  in  some  of the
       frustration of our members in not having anything to point to that
       proves Tesla codified a science that gives free energy, or deals in
       time travel, or that can shield people\cities from harm.  These are,
       after all, pretty  extravagant   claims   and   it  is  easy  to  be
       intimidated by the embarrassment of being laughed at.

       The devices that prove Tesla technology exists, are simply not being
       mass produced nor  are they being ballyhooed (against  an  obviously
       disinterested scientific community).    The  foremost  reason  I  am
       actively involved in this group is to do anything I can to get these
       devices to the general public. A little known historical fact about
       the personal computer illustrates that a tiny handful of individuals
       released plans and kits to the general public just one step ahead of
       the military's (among others) attempts to shut them down. Obviously
       the release of working Tesla devices  are  far more portentous. Hold
       on to your hats.

       To show you what we are involved in as far as the perception of the
       general public is concerned, I ran across the following snippets in
       the Colliers Encyclopedia.  This is history -- as  it  is  currently
       being taught:

       "Physicists came to  think  of  all  space  as  occupied  by  a real
       substance with some very peculiar  properties  designed  to transmit
       light waves but  to avoid certain other consequences.   This  medium
       was called the  ether,  and  following  earlier philosophers such as
       Descartes, physicists gradually   came   to   the   conclusion  that
       gravitational (as well   as  electric  and  magnetic)   forces   are
       transmitted as some  sort  of  pressure  in  this  fluid.   Only  as
       attempts to formulate a consistent  theory  of the ether met with no
       success did it  begin to appear that though the ether  answered  the
       question of action  at  a distance, the answer could not be regarded
       as satisfactory.

       It remained for Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) to put all the pieces
       together; to abolish the ether, as  it  were,  and to postulate that
       standards of absolute  space  and  time have no physical  existence,
       since no conceivable  experiment  can  reveal their existence in any
       way."

       The Encyclopedia Americana said much  the  same thing but was kinder
       in their summation with the following:

       "Although the classical  concept  of  the  ether is  now  considered
       obsolete, the concept  of  space  in  modern physics retains certain
       affinities with an  ether:  space  is  not  conceived  as  something
       totally vacuous but as the seat of various energetic processes."

       Tesla, of course, knew that the "ether" existed and proved it many
       times over. Tesla  scientists,  since  then,  have   delineated  the
       mathematics behind the   discoveries,   but   it   will   be  up  to
       organizations and businesses such as ours to "force" it out into the
       open.

       There is, by definition, only one  Unified  Field  Theory.  Einstein




       spoke often and  loudly  that  relativity  was not the Unified Field
       Theory.  Yet science keeps forcing  us  into  accepting  it as such.
       Next issue we  will  promote some ideas of why current  science  has
       failed us, along with some Tesla alternatives.
