       Definition of New Energy

       New Energy or advanced energy technology includes theory, research,
       construction and testing of advanced energy devices.  These devices
       and systems operate with a higher efficiency than those used today
       and include advanced concepts where energy conversion may appear to
       be over unity.  This means there is a greater output of energy from
       a system as compared to the energy input.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       New Energy Topics

       Space Power Generators, "over unity" and "free energy" machines,
       Scalar wave theory, magnetic motors, vortex mechanics, cold fusion,
       electrostatic generators, nuclear isotopes, motional magnetic
       fields, zero point energy, N-Machines, homopolar generators, Adams
       Motors and others.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Purpose

       The purpose of the International Symposium on New Energy (ISNE) is
       to bring together outstanding New Energy researchers and their

                                      Page 1




       hardware, who will share and discuss their latest research findings.
       The goals of the symposium are to stimulate new research ideas,
       coalesce researchers with industry, and to find funding sources.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Institute for New Energy

       The Institute for New Energy is the sponsor of the International
       Symposium on New Energy.  It is a membership organization whose
       monthly newsletter updates the latest happenings in New Energy.  The
       Institute's primary purpose is to promote research and educate
       society on the importance of alternative energy.  It is a subsidiary
       of the International Association of New Science (IANS) whose goal it
       is to institute a paradigm shift in science and medicine.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Philosophy

       The Institute for New Energy believes that the planet Earth is in
       peril and something needs to be done IMMEDIATELY to save it from
       environmental destruction.  INE believes that one key to solving the
       environmental holocaust is with New Energy technology.  INE believes
       it is imperative that this technology be researched, developed and
       released to the public and industry to help save this planet.  This
       is the reason for the International Symposium on New Energy.
