MAGSPIN - (this is a fascinating email sent by our friend Lee Trippett)

Hello Jerry!

Neal Hyatt brought over a video he recently acquired.  It shows John Searl
giving a lecture in England in the late '80s.  John is showing off the unusual
properties of his special 'free energy' magnets.  This is done by suspending
with thread an ordinary metal paper clip over the magnet.  The paper clip
takes on a very rapid spinning motion.

Since I had a rare earth cylinder magnet with a diameter of 0.5 inch and a
length of 0.5 inch, we likewise suspended a similar paper clip and were very
surprised to see it take on a RAPID SPINNING MOTION.

We opened the clip to prevent any induced current loops and still saw a lot
of action.  We made the clip straight, attached the thread with tape and still
saw lots of action.  We tried larger straight metal rods and there was NO
ACTION but the common metallic magnetic attraction.

The spin is directly related to the up and down motion of the suspended metal
piece and the direction of the spin is always the same regardless of the
magnetic pole.

We see no evidence of 'free energy' only a change in the form.  The phenomena
DOES NOT APPEAR WITH ANY OTHER TYPES OF MAGNETS.  We have not tried other
variables as we discovered the unusual action only yesterday.

Many thanks for the recent newsletters!  Hope to see you in Colorado Springs
this coming July.
                                                              Lee Trippett
                                   * * * * *
Such a simple phenomenon to prove and we need to thank Lee for NOTICING it and
thinking enough of everyone else to share it!           (Thanks Lee!)

I went over to Radio Shack and bought a pair of 'Rare Earth' magnets (2 for
about $3.00).  On the back of the package, it says these are 'neodymium' and
they are each about the size of a small aspirin.  Just as Lee suggested, I
superglued the magnet to a surface, a thread to a paper clip and slowly
lowered it over the magnet.  As it got closer, it started to spin, achieving a
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vanguard Sciences / KeelyNet  *  PO BOX 870716  * Mesquite, TX  * 75187 USA
goodly velocity before encountering the back torque from the now wound up
thread.

Each time it spun counter-clockwise.  I turned the magnets upside down so that
North was now South and the paper clip STILL spins CCW!  An email about this
on KeelyNet led others to experiment with it also.  Joel McClain reports his
paper clip spun CLOCKWISE, no matter which pole was facing upwards!  Yet Dan
Davidson out in Arizona reports his spins CCW?

Joel even went so far as to attach a fishing swivel to the thread and the clip
would not spin at all.  Following Joel's idea, I tried several different types
and sizes of swivels and the clip NEVER spins when attached to one of these.

The idea that there is some kind of spinning field associated with a magnet
was definitely new to most of us.  However, our Canadian friend Clayton Hanna
said Christopher Hills had published this experiment in his book 'Supersonics'
back in the 70's.  Sure enough, I remembered Hills was using the experiment as
some sort of dowsing proof of the 'vertical current'.

So, it spins, big deal.  Well, it IS a big deal because it flies in the face
of what is understood about magnetic fields.  I secured a barium ferrite, a
strontium, an Alnico and the neodymium magnets to a plastic plate with
superglue.

The paper clip was slowly lowered over each of these in turn.  The point was
to see if it had some relationship to the material or was it simply the higher
FLUX density as associated with rare earth magnets such as neodymium.

When suspended over the barium ferrite magnet, it locked into one position.
When suspended over the strontium magnet, it locked into one position.
When suspended over the Alnico magnet, it rotated like BLAZES and CCW!
When suspended over the neodymium magnet, it again rotated CCW.

Because the field strength of the Alnico was so strong, I inserted the paper
clip from the side at an angle of about 45 degrees and it AGAIN spun CCW!

The common factor?  The Alnico was larger than the neodymium and very
powerful, while the barium ferrite and strontium magnets were much weaker.
When magnets are strong, the lines of force are much closer together.  So the
clip seems to 'fall into the cracks' of the field lines that are farther
apart.  That is why it locks into place, at least in my opinion.

Dan Davidson thinks the spin direction (CCW) has something to do with the left
hand rule of current flow, while Bert Pool thinks it might be due to the twist
of the thread.  That is, it could twist to the left or to the right when it is
woven together, thus 'biasing' the magnet to begin spinning in a preferred
direction as when Joel's spun CW.  Very curious and untested as far as I know
at this point.

So there appears to be a 'motor force' held within the embrace of a magnet.
Would a giant magnet have enough energy to turn a giant paper clip, possibly
attached to a shaft capable of doing work?  In speaking with Patrick Flanagan,
he remembered a description of an experiment by Gustave Le Bon back around the
turn of the century.  It required a bowl (Petrie dish) of mercury with a bar
or cylinder magnet placed in the center.  A copper wire loop was suspended
over the magnet and another piece of wire was hung over the loop with the
other end dragging in the mercury.  The hanging wire would spin CONTINUOUSLY!
And this was about 1898!!

I don't know if I recalled the exact experiment, but I have that very rare
Gustave Le Bon book, thanks to Borderland Sciences.  The government removed
all copies of Le Bon's two wonderful books during World War II because they
gave major insights on atomic phenomena.  The books are called 'Evolution of
Matter' and 'Evolution of Energy'....get these photocopies while they are
still available as they offer a wealth of 'new' information.  I believe each
of these books is around $30.00.

Energetics and French Translation

Speaking of French....through the efforts of a Canadian friend, I now have a
French copy of a very rare book (1922) and two others that relate to the same
subject.  I don't speak or read French, nor do I wish to have to take the time
to scan these in and have a computer program translate them.

Would anyone out there be willing to read the book(s - 3) onto an audiotape so
I could transcribe them into English?  This would be the easiest way all
around and I would gladly pay for the service.  The information is of intense
interest to me as it deals with the relationship between energy and FORM...as
in the amazing Pavlita 'Psychtronic' Generators.  There is something going on
with 3 dimensional sound (mantra) and 2 dimensional patterns (mandala).  They
function like the chicken and the egg, which came first?  You know I'll pass
on the hot stuff to you in some form or another (mailer, copies, computer
files).

I think it correlates with a copy of some papers kindly given to me by Leonard
Dorsett and which came from the Leading Edge newsletter.  These papers
recounted an experiment in 'energetic mind expansion'.  The people at this
secret, invitation-only conference met in Chicago last year and are supposedly
very advanced.

One page of the report says they had determined the frequency of ammonia at
40,000cps and the frequency of LSD at 11,000cps.  Using sterochemistry, the
LSD was photographed and projected onto a wall.  (a mandala - 2 dimensional)

A group of test subjects were allowed to view this picture while listening to
the 11,000cps signal (a mantra - 3 dimensional).  ALL EXPERIENCED LSD
HALLUCINOGENIC EFFECTS!  Yet, no drug was used?  When the 11,000cps tone was
turned off after several hours, the effect faded away and there was no
physical trace of the drug in the body.

If this is so, it indicates a radical new method of treatment using totally
energetic methods.  A very sweet Canadian lady, Nicole Violette attended
several of our Roundtables about a year ago.  She was using an Amiga computer
to take about a one minute sample of a person's voice.  On examining the
waveforms, you could see certain frequencies which were missing in the overall
spectra.  A healthy person, when speaking, produces an orchestra of notes.

By looking for the missing frequencies, an indication was given of what
elements the body was missing or needing more of.  Nicole said the people who
developed this system were in California and sold it for about $5,000.  The
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vanguard Sciences / KeelyNet  *  PO BOX 870716  * Mesquite, TX  * 75187 USA
body was most receptive to ELF signals in the range of 15 to 20 cycles per
second.  The frequencies missing from the 'voiceprint' were successively
divided by two (octave reduction) until they fell as close to or within the 15
to 20 cps range as possible.  These frequencies were then broadcast through a
high quality woofer (speaker) into the body.  The effect is not understood,
but several of us tried it with special tapes made personally for us and all
experienced a postive effect.  (There is a correlation that has to be made
with each element but I don't recall the technique at the moment.)  So here we
have one or more frequencies applied to produce the effect of various
elements.

Nicoles' machine reminded me of a Global Sciences Congress that Dean Stonier
has every August in Denver and in February in Florida.  This was about 5 years
ago at a Denver Congress.  There was a fellow there named Wayne (something)
and he was from Alaska.  He claimed he had a box that contained highly
polished natural gemstones, through which a very bright, white light was
projected into the eyes of a person.

His theory was that colors represented elements or energies that the body
needed.  He likened it to wells, like cans of colored paint.  The ones that
were low or empty would NOT ALLOW YOU TO SEE THAT COLOR!

You looked into the box and he would sequence each of the gemstones into your
field of view, allowing the white light to project this natural color into
your eyes.  What was weird, different people could not see one or more colors
that others could clearly see.

After you looked at the 'invisible' colors for a short period of time, you
would begin to see a color and it would get brighter and clearer.  This was
indicating you were 'filling' up your empty well.  Ok, Ok, laugh if you want
but it correlates and I looked through the box, but could see all the colors
though some appeared dimmer than others.

Why do I think there is something to this?  Because while riding the hotel
shuttle over to the hotel from the airport, there were several people in the
shuttle who were conference bound.  We all talked with each other.  One of
these people was an old man, bent over and shuffling, on his last legs.  I
spoke with him and he said he was a retired farmer who had heard there were
alternative medical approaches presented at Dean's congresses, so he was in
such miserable shape, he decided to try it out.  I really felt sorry for the
old guy as he was in great pain and it took him a very long time to get from
one point to another.

I saw and spoke with this old fellow for about the first 3 days of this 5 day
conference.  About the 4th day, I saw the old man darn near dancing down the
hall, no longer stooped and a look of extreme happiness on his face.  He
stopped to talk with me and I asked what the heck had happened to him.  He
said he went up to this guys room and looked into some weird box.  At first he
couldn't see hardly any of the colors but they slowly came into full, clear
view.  After that, he felt better but still could not get around very well.

The old guy said when he woke up the next morning, he felt very strange, in
his case, that meant, he felt very WELL.  He got out of bed and found he could
walk normally, without pain and the associated problems.  I phreaked!

There were others who also claimed to be better after looking into this box,
but nothing as dramatic as this old fellow.  Yes, I REALIZE he could have been
a SHILL (in the employ of this Wayne fellow), but if you had seen him as often
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vanguard Sciences / KeelyNet  *  PO BOX 870716  * Mesquite, TX  * 75187 USA
as I did, seen the very real, pained look in his eyes, heard his labored
breathing and saw him have to stop every so often to try to reduce the pain
(for 3 days!)....there is something going on here!  And that's why I'm telling
you all this and chaining it together hoping you can see what I might be
imagining.

This also correlates with the claims of Dinshah Ghadiali and his CHROMOTHERAPY
(now called PHOTOTHERAPY - using tuned colored laser light), where he used
very bright light passing through colored filters of specific wavelengths.  He
claimed to have CURED many people of various diseases and physical ailments by
bombarding the afflicted area with these various colored lights.  In both
these cases, we again have frequencies which appear to restore SOMETHING in
the body that is missing.

The Incunabula (INCUNAB1, INCUNAB2, ONGSHAT files on KeelyNet) papers indicate
space and/or time can be distorted using a combination of sensory deprivation,
meditation and a mandala/mantra that are frequency/pattern related.  This is
the basis of the Chladni waveplates that Keely used as ANALYTICAL INSTRUMENTS
and to produce phenomena using acoustics.

In speaking with Patrick and Gael Flanagan about this mandala/mantra
phenomenon, they had seen a TV show about a fellow who was using a computer to
analyze the crop circles in England.  He was attempting to do the same thing
Dr. Hans Jenny did in Switzerland in the 1960's.  That is, to produce a 3
dimensional form IN SPACE from one or more sounds.  This is the heart of Vedic
science as in the file VEDA1 on KeelyNet.  Two dimensional patterns/geometries
can be excited and empowered by three dimensional RESONANT GEOMETRIES, such as
can be produced using sound, magnetism, electromagnetism or other energies.

The idea is, once you find the spatial coordinates that are mapped by sound,
you could go back and forth, producing the sound from the pattern or the
pattern from the sound.  A MAJOR step in understanding how the Vedic sciences
worked and dangerous beyond belief for reasons you can find out for yourself.

And, a final spooky thing, since this section of the mailer seems to be
floating in and out of that realm....<grin>, please don't ask for names/places
in this case because I can't oblige.  A fellow called up and we talked for
quite a while about numerous things.  He said he went to a fellow researchers
house and was shown his 'latest' discovery.  The details provided are nowhere
near enough but here is what he said.

This guy's friend asked for his drivers license.  He gave it to the
researcher, who lifted the pyramid and placed the drivers license between two
plates.  When the pyramid was placed back over the plates, my contact
experienced a continous high amplitude 'rush' or 'high' as if he had been
smoking marijuana or taken some kind of feel-good drug.  He said it was so
overpowering he had to sit down and just enjoy it!

After a few minutes, the researcher lifted the pyramid, causing the 'rush' to
slowly fade.  The drivers license was removed and the feeling was completely
gone.  As far as my contact could see, there was some kind of pattern
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vanguard Sciences / KeelyNet  *  PO BOX 870716  * Mesquite, TX  * 75187 USA
inscribed on the plate that faced the drivers license.  We discussed how this
could have worked and it appears there is some way the pyramid energy excited
the 3 dimensional component of the 2 dimensional pattern (again the
mandala/mantra relationship).

I know this is very hard to believe, I am not asking you to, just think about
it in relation to the other parts of this section.  I don't know that I buy
into it, but there is much more that one can discern in this by studying up on
pyramid phenomena, radionics, homeopathy and wave propagation/conjugation.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Superconducting Tissue?

In this month's Scientific American (May, 1995 - pages 33-34), there is a
fascinating article called 'Electric Genes' that correlates very nicely with
David Hudson's ideas about the aura of the body being a Meissner Field, at
least where it might be produced.  Basically, the discovery indicates a means
to screen for genetic imperfections, detect the presence of viruses in a
person's blood or toxic bacteria in food.

"Chemist Thomas J. Meade and molecular biologist Jon F. Kayyem have devised a
way of binding atoms of ruthenium, a heavy metal, to ribose, one of the
backbone components of the helical chains of DNA.  Ruthenium atoms act like
electrical connectors into and out of the molecule; they have the added
virtue of neither disrupting nor distorting its overall shape."

The researchers were examining the electrical properties of short lengths of
double-helix DNA which had a ruthenium atom at each end of one of the strands.
Based on earlier studies, they estimated a short single strand of DNA should
conduct 100 electrons PER SECOND.  To their amazement, when they measured the
electron flow rate along a ruthenium-doped double helix, the current flow was
up by a factor of more than 10,000 times, that is one million electrons per
second!  The ruthenium-doped double helix was behaving as a piece of molecular
wire.

Other researchers had speculated that the double helix might create a highly
conductive path along the axis of the molecule, a route that DOES NOT EXIST in
the single strand.  Does this tell us something?  Complementary, mirror image
pairs that 'conjugate' in the center along the backbone, what does that sound
like?

the latest TOMI discovery (excerpted from the KeelyNet file TOMIFLAT)

                     Sent to KeelyNet by author/researcher

                                Ossie Callanan
                          From: Melbourne, Australia

The Flat Linear TOMI Device

After reading and duplicating the original TOMI device, I was intrigued by the
need to have a track that consisted of ramps of inclination and declination
although at the time I percieved that one of the requirements for the device
to work was for it to utilise both gravitation and magnetic anomalies.

After considerable experimentation I found that I was able to completely do
away with the gravitational component of the device, which held the need for
ramps of inclination and declination, and have a device that was completely
driven by the magnetic anomally itself on a completely flat horizontal linear
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vanguard Sciences / KeelyNet  *  PO BOX 870716  * Mesquite, TX  * 75187 USA
track of UNLIMITED LENGTH. This makes duplication of the device and the result
almost foolproof.

All one needs to make this version of the device is a stack of button magnets
(I used the round holeless ferrite type - 10mm diameter by 5 mm thick), a role
of double sided tape, a little bit of masking tape and a flat table top. There
is no need to make any special ramped track as the table top is used for your
flat track.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Construction Details

First make the roller. This is the same as described in the original TOMI
device text and consists of 7 to 10 magnets of the same polar direction stuck
together in a role and held together with a bit of masking tape.

Next lay two parallel and straight lines of double sided tape on the table
top. The distance between the two lines of tape should be the length of roller
plus 1.5 to 2 inches. Peel off the top of the double sided tape and now you
are ready for the most important part, the laying of the track magnets.  This
is the most important and unique part that I have developed, which lets the
device work on a flat linear track. The track magnets are not stuck together
but are INDIVIDUALLY SEPARATED by a gap or shall I say a gap of TWO DIFFERENT
DISTANCES.

Place the magnets one by one on the first line of double sided tape all in the
same polar direction with the polar axis parallel to the tape. In between the
magnets leave a gap of a CERTAIN LENGTH and then a gap of DOUBLE the LENGTH
for every ALTERNATE gap.  The gap distance I used for the type of magnets I
had was 5 mm and 10 mm respectively. This alternation of gap distance IS THE
KEY to continuous (linear) operation on a flat horizontal track.

The gap distance or the fact that ONE IS DOUBLE THE OTHER is not crucial and
is variable.  What is crucial is the alternation of the gap distances because
if they were all the same distance, the propulsive magnetic anomally will only
occur at the beginning and the end of the track limiting the length of the
track, this is why a ramped track was necessary in the original TOMI device.

When two alternate gap distances are used, the propulsive anomaly is present
throughout the length of the track allowing an unlimited length of track that
is flat and horizontal although it may work on a constant incline of which
depends on the propulsion strength.

To complete construction place another row of magnets on the other line of
double sided tape except the polarities must be opposite that of the first
line of magnets and parallel to the length of the track. Make sure that the
magnets line up perpendicular to the length and in line with the magnets on
the other line of tape.

Now that you have finished the track all you have to do is place the roller
anywhere in the track (perpendicular to the length of the track of course)
and it will roll in its appropriate polar direction till it reaches the end
of the track. The roller may be turned over swapping its own polar direction
and you will find it will also roll in the opposite direction till it reaches
the end of the track.

   (The beauty of this is the discovery of the alternate spacing of the
    magnets and the willingness of the experimenter to share his findings with
    all of us.  Excellent, THANK YOU Ossie!)

The following arguments show some of what goes on with the UseNet Responses;

: There's a big difference between being open minded and empty headed.
: Unfortunately, those that perpetuate the myth of perpetual motion, free
: energy, and other something from nothing devices fall into the later
: category.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vanguard Sciences / KeelyNet  *  PO BOX 870716  * Mesquite, TX  * 75187 USA
I think you are making a basic error here.  There are two phenomena you are
lumping together: perpetual motion and free energy.  Perpetual motion is in
the same class as Maxwell's Demon devices: foolish to pursue.  But there's
evidence here and there for devices which RECEIVE energy from an unknown
source.  The ones I'm thinking of are not scams or hoaxes (where the inventors
had their lives wrecked by announcing their discoveries.)

It is entirely within the bounds of conventional physics that there could be
undiscovered mechanisms for converting matter to energy, for changing neutrino
flux into electric power, for building "tame spacewarps" to extract power,
etc.

A working "perpetual motion" machine is not very likely, but IT IS NOT
IMPOSSIBLE!  And if anyone ever comes up with one, it will quickly be renamed
"energy receiver" or some such.  After all, everyone knows that "perpetual
motion" machines are impossible.

: Rejection of man's accumulated body of scientific knowledge isn't
: being 'open minded' -- It's being ignorant, stupid, or both.

This sounds like a cliche', but its true: those that pursued powered flight,
spacecraft, etc., were accused of the same thing.  A few decades ago, planes
and spacecraft were foolish dreams, and any who worked towards them were
ridiculed.  Only in hindsight are the true fools obvious.

: As I've  said before, free energy schemes, perpetual motion, et al are fun
: to contemplate as logical puzzles or, at times, exercises in deception,
: however, anyone that beleves such devices are real, risks labeling
: themselves a fool.

....No, anyone who believes such devices COULD be real, risks BEING labeled a
fool by people who are ready to heap ridicule on others whose beliefs about
what might be possible differ from their own.  I think of it this way: in five
hundred years, will mankind be using power generators which extract energy
directly from the vacuum?

If so, will such generators be based on discoveries that THE RESEARCHERS OF
TODAY could have made, had they just known where to look?  Maybe.  And it's
possible that SOMEONE TODAY IS LOOKING RIGHT AT THE EFFECTS that lead to these
generators, yet discounts them as being MEASUREMENT MISTAKES, since energy
CANNOT just come from nowhere!

Where does one draw the line on the definition of free energy?  How do we
label energy created by wind or water motion?  How does this vary from the
earth's magnetic fields (if I have been following this thread correctly...)?
I have no connection with these fellows nor their research.  However, making
blanket statements such as THERE IS NO FREE ENERGY is a bit bold.  Yes, yes I
know.  The laws of physics.  If you read Penrose or Hawking you'll discover
that it ain't all been figured out yet...                  cheers, Bryan
