The local arrangements and program committee is Brenda Dunne, Mike Epstein,

The meeting this year is at the Holiday Inn at 7667 Center Avenue, Huntington
Beach, CA 92647 (714) 891-0123.  This hotel is relatively new, next to a
quaint shopping tax for singles, doubles, triples and quads will permit lower
total conference costs.  Space is guaranteed through June 1.

The Registration fee for the meeting for early arrivals is being planned for
Wednesday evening, June 14th.  Friday afternoon will feature a trip to visit
the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens.  The Library is
famous for its Gutenberg Bible and for Ben Franklin's autobiograph; the Art
Gallery contains rare tapestries, porcelains, sculpture, a collection of
French furniture, and the Blue Boy by Gainesborough; the gardens have 14,000
varieties of plants representative of ecosystems around the world.  The
Society banquet is scheduled for Saturday evening.

The Society banquet will be held on the evening of Saturday; the cost is
$15.00 per person.  You should plan on staying through Saturday evening as
meetings will be scheduled for that day, with a break to get ready for the
banquet.

Participants arriving by air should note that Orange County airport is about
20 minutes away to the South, Long Beach airport is about 20 minutes to the
North, and Los Angeles International is about 40 minutes away using the new
105 freeway.  These times assume no accidents or traffic jams.

Members are encouraged to contribute papers for presentation at the meeting.
