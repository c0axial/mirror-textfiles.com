    Thought you and  others  on  the  board  might  be interested in a
    couple of the national echos that can be accessed from various
    local BBSes free of charge.

    The local board, NCC-1701 [tel.  no.214-771-3226],  has  the bases
    listed below. I saw something about a "hover craft" in the science
    echo, and there is also the UFO echo. I'm really not very familiar
    with either echo, as my time is taken up visiting the MIDI and DTP
    echos, but echos in general are interesting because  they  include
    people from the whole country and sometimes other countries.
