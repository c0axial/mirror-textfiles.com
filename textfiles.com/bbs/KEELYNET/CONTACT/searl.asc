       Vangard Notes...

           The following  information  details  the  results  of  extensive
           collaboration with John Searl by John Thomas of Rochester, NY..

           We were informed of the work in  progress about 2 years ago by a
           fellow KeelyNetter yet forbidden to reveal the  name  until  the
           work had  been  successfully completed.  Part of the fear had to
           do with the many problems Searl has had and it was felt the best
           approach was to wait til the  majority  of  the  work  had  been
           completed before full public release.

           That work dealt with the use of magic square patterns that could
           be implemented in hardware or physical patterns.

           Searl uses  these  matrices  to  provide  the "augmentation"  or
           "magnification" of not only electron velocities but also kinetic
           velocities of the mass, otherwise known as "mass current".

           There have  been  MANY  negative and/or inaccurate reports as to
           Searls work and it is hoped these  books  will  not only help to
           clarify the errors but also to point the way to  some  practical
           understanding of the Searl concepts.

           We highly  recommend  the study of the books which have resulted
           from this long collaboration.

                          PROFESSOR JOHN ROY ROBERT SEARL

       Prof. John Searl is the ONLY man in  history to have built and flown
       an antigravity device called a LEVITY DISC.

       This was recorded by the BBC News and by the Newspapers. The BBC ran
       a weekly piece on Prof. Searls work and progress for  almost a year.
       These Television broadcasts  showed  the  Levity  Disc in flight and
       gave updates on the work being done to build a large craft.

       There were articles and pictures  in  the  Sunday Mirror on November
       28th 1971, Derbyshire District and The Hants and  Berks  Gazette  in
       1969.  There were pictures taken by John Hocknell Press Photographer
       which accompanied a press writeup by Phil Sanders on July 4th 1969.

                                      Page 1




       There were many  pictures  and  write-ups done on Prof. Searl during
       this time.

       The power source for this amazing  disc can also be used to generate
       electricity with no  apparent  input from outside.  Because  of  the
       obvious economical repercussions  to  the  big money oil industries,
       this marvelous invention was squelched.

       Prof. Searl has offered this wonderful  boon  to  all  mankind since
       1946. The story of his hardships and persecution is a long one. Long
       after most men would have given in to the pressures  of big business
       and corrupt government  officials  he has come back one last time to
       offer this inspired work to the world.

       His electric generator and his Levity  Disc  are  powered by a Searl
       Effect Generator (S.E.G.). If we the people of the  world  choose to
       use this marvelous technology, we could eliminate pollution from the
       internal combustion engine  and  the  various  methods  of  home and
       industrial heating. Anything that  can  be  run  electrically can be
       driven by an S.E.G. with virtually no pollution and  no  use of fuel
       as we know it.

       Prof. Searl uses  existing physics laws in a new application. He has
       written a series of books on his  work  and  is offering them to the
       public. His technology is based on a coherent number  system  called
       THE LAW OF THE SQUARES. His books have the same name.

       We should not  let  the  corruption  of  a  certain few deny us of a
       chance to heal our earth and advance  technologically.  This  may be
       our last chance.

       Most of us are aware of the hole in the Ozone layer above the earth.
       We also know of the mass destruction of the Rain  Forests.  We  read
       about the nuclear waste from our power plants and its very long half
       life. We see  our  factories belching smoke and our rivers and lakes
       being polluted. We know about acid rain and dead lakes.

       These things seem far away from our everyday life. Most things still
       seem normal to us in our day to day lives. But one day we might wake
       up to the fact that we are TOO LATE to repair the damage done to our
       environment.

       The Earth will survive. The Human Race may not.
                                                        John A. Thomas Jr.

       Prof. John R. R. Searl has requested  that I act as Intermediary for
       him concerning any  questions or inquiries you may  have  concerning
       his work.

       Mr. Searl believes it is imperative that his work be revealed to the
       public at this  time and has written a series of books entitled "THE
       LAW OF THE SQUARES". These books  describe  the  technology  used to
       develop the SEG (SEARL EFFECT GENERATOR).

       As all of his time is devoted to his efforts in this  field,  I have
       agreed to assist with the correspondence concerning his work. I have
       enclosed a list of the books and information available at this time.
       This list will  be  updated  as  new  books  and information becomes
       available.
                                                       John A. Thomas Jr.

                          PROF. JOHN R. R. SEARL'S BOOKS

       The books entitled "THE LAW OF THE SQUARES" by Prof. Searl are being
       offered in manuscript form. They have  not been edited or changed in
       any way. Since Prof. Searl is dealing with new concepts and new ways
       of applying existing physics in his work, any editing may change the
       content or intention of the work.

                                      Page 3





       These books transverse  many subjects and contain the personal views
       and appraisals of Prof.  Searl as  well  as  giving  the  reader  an
       insight as to how his S.E.G is constructed and operates.  As readers
       and seekers of  the truth we are very fortunate that Prof. Searl has
       decided to carry on with his work.

       I feel privileged and honored that I have had the opportunity to get
       to know this man who is an independent  free  thinker.  I regard the
       knowledge that I have received from him and his books  as a precious
       gift. To me,  he  has the same kind of inspirational creative genius
       as Tesla and Einstein. In Prof. Searl's words, "I have given you the
       answers. It is up to you to come up with the right questions."

       Also being offered is the book called  "ANTIGRAVITY - THE DREAM MADE
       REALITY", by John A. Thomas Jr.. This book will serve as a primer to
       Prof. Searl's books. In it there is a description  of  John  Searl's
       early days through  to  the  present, as related by Prof. John Searl
       himself. There is also a description  of  the  S.E.G.  generator and
       flying craft.

       There is a video tape available of Prof. Searl's 1989 Munich lecture
       in which he describes his technology in detail.

       Payment for orders  outside the USA should be made by  International
       Money Order. Be sure to include postage and handling.
