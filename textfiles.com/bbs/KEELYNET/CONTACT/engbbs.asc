       The Computer Plumber BBS is pleased to present the following
       directory of Engineering Oriented Bulletin Board Systems.

       This list contains  some  of the bulletin board systems which may be
       of interest to you.  If you know of  a bulletin board system that is
       strong on engineering   or   scientific  subjects   or   have   more
       information on those  listed, please leave a comment to the sysop on
       The Computer Plumber BBS at 319-337-6723.

                 accessible location in the same place that  this  file  is

                 written permission from me.

         A friend (who I have never met) once found his similar effort in a
       book in a  bookstore, with no credit given to him, or any indication
       of how to keep the list going. I hope  that this copyright effort is
       a waste of time, and evidence of paranoia.

         I started doing this because of the difficulty  I  had  in finding
       these systems. I'd  like  to  find more and let other engineers know
       about them.  The number one goal  of  this  file is to get engineers
       talking to each other.

         Many thanks  to those sysops who went out of their  way  to  offer
       editing and organization assistance.

          Dave Thompson; FidoNet 1:18/60  A  QuickBBS  system, with 40MB of
          Storage; approximately 25MB of files.
          This board caters to programming engineers and scientists.  Files
          supporting Turbo  Pascal,  C  (MS  and  Turbo)  and  FORTRAN  are
          maintained on  the  system,  as  are other programs in support of
          programming on personal computers.   Many  of these files contain
          source code.   Other  files  are  comprised  of  applications  of
          interest to   professional   users   and   many  general  purpose
          utilities.  Because of the relatively  small  storage  space  for
          files, all  files  are  of  high  quality  and  most   have  been
          personally reviewed by the sysop.

       Energy Management Systems BBS  913-842-6110
          This board has been started as a help to all plant engineers and
          maintenance people.  It is hoped that everyone calling  here  can
          get help in keeping up with all the changes that are happening in
          maintaining a  company  building  and  controlling  rising energy
          costs. We will try to support as many energy management systems
          as we can. I know there are several systems around, but with this
          board we might be able to help  someone  with  a problem on their
          system.

          EBBS is a subscription service.  While mainly of interest to
          Civil AND STRUCTURAL Engineers, it offers programs in a number of
          engineering fields. Many of the programs are only available to
          subscribers and will not be found on free bulletin boards.  EBBS
          is very strong on Lotus 123 engineering applications.

       General Electric Plastics
          The firm has provided an ENGINEERING DESIGN DATABASE available
          to interested engineers.  The database contains information on
          stress/strain creep, fatigue, and other properties of GE
          plastics. The system runs software to aid in the selection of
          plastics. It requires 1200 or 2400 baud modem and Tektronics
          emulation software (or a Tektronics terminal, I presume).

          SYSOP: Bob Pauls; Carbondale, IL 62901
          The Preservation-BBS  exists  to  provide technical and strategic
          advice to  callers regarding the  use  of  historic  preservation
          tools for the development of communities. Preservation is both an
          art and  a  science  requiring a multi-disciplinary  approach  to
          community, building and site protection. Standards exist by which
          all historically   and   architecturally  significant  structures
          should be  repaired, replaced  and  adaptively  reused.  The  BBS
          serves as technical resource as well as a forum  for preservation
          activists to  explore  creative  solutions  to  the  loss  of the
          world's cultural heritage.
