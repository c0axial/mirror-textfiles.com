       We at KeelyNet appreciate the quality and vast knowledge of the many
       fine people we have had the pleasure of speaking or corresponding
       with.  Many of our friends and contacts have information that should
       be presented to a MUCH WIDER audience and which we try to do with
       KeelyNet and other BBS's of like nature.

       The IECEC is one of the more technical conferences and is sponsored
       by 7 separate professional groups, the American Chemical Society
       (ACS), the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics
       (AIAA), the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), the
       American Nuclear Society (ANS), the American Society of Mechanical
       Engineers (ASME), the Institute of Electrical and Electronic
       Engineers (IEEE) and the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE).

       With all the information that we all come across as well as those
       little experiments we all carry out, there must be lots of possible
       topics that the folks at this conference would be FASCINATED by.  So
       we encourage you to write up a paper and submit it, you never know,
       you might be accepted and gain a whole new audience.

                                    GO FOR IT!

                                Call for Papers for
          the 28th Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conference
                to be held in Atlanta, Georgia - August 8-13, 1993
                            at the Hyatt Regency Hotel

                         Energy - Environment - Economics

       The American Chemical Society (ACS) announces the 28th InterSociety
       Energy Conversion Engineering Conference.  The IECEC provides a
       forum to present and discuss engineering aspects of energy
       conversion, advanced and unconventional energy systems/devices,
       energy conversion/utilization, environmental issues, and policy
       implications on research, development, and implementation of
       technologies.  Papers dealing with all engineering facets of
       terrestrial and aerospace power as well as advanced energy systems
       that fall into the topical areas listed are welcome.

       Four copies of each 500 word abstract must be submitted to the
       Technical Program Chairman by December 18, 1992.

                                      Page 1





       Abstracts should include sufficient information to explain and
       support the new and significant results dealing with any topic
       within the scope of the IECEC Topical Areas.

       The title, topical area appropriate to the abstract, the name,
       address, phone and FAX of the author to whom correspondence should
       be addressed must be clearly stated at the top of the first page.

       Authors will be notified of abstract acceptance and will receive
       instructions for manuscript preparation in February, 1993.  Camera
       ready copy will be due at the ACS no later than May 21, 1993.
       Accepted papers will be published in the IECEC-1993 proceedings and
       will be presented orally at the conference.

       Four copies of each abstract should be mailed before December 18 to:

                                 Joe W. Hightower
