                               The Photon Belt Story

       Is our solar  system  about  to enter a cosmic 'cloud', as part of a
       12,000 year cycle?  We present this obscure but popular 1981
       article for you to decide.

       People all over  the  world  are  grasping, reaching out for
       little pieces of knowledge, enlightenment, hope for the future of
       their  children in a world of growing degradation,  drugs, rape,
       murder, etc.  The Prophets of doom preach of physical horror and
       annihilation.  It is like a great vortex, a great sucking spiral,
       ever downward, blackness, despair.

       You look upwards, can see the light  at  the  top and grasp and claw
       your way to get out of that ever quickening pull  of  despair.   The
       truth sometimes is so simple that we look past it, ignore it and try
       to find a  much  more  complicated  answer, when all the time, it is
       there, staring you right in the  face,  your  passport  out  of  the
       vortex into the future.

       It all starts   with   a   little   atom  and  the group  of  little
       electrons which orbit around it.  English physicist Paul Adrain
       Maurice Dirac, said that for each type of particle, an anti-particle
       will exist.


                                      Page 1





       In 1932, Carl David Anderson discovered the anti-electron and called
       it a positron.   In  1956,  the  anti-proton  and  anti-neutron were
       discovered.

       When an  anti-particle is formed,  it  comes  into  existence  in  a
       universe  of ordinary  particles,  and  it  is  only   a  matter  of
       time....a  fraction  of  a  second...before  it  meets  and collides
       with an electron.  The charges cancel, the total mass of the pair is
       converted into energy in the form  of  PHOTONS.   This offers  a new
       and unprecedented powerful source of energy.  The PHOTON is about to
       become your way of life in the very near future.

       A PHOTON BAND  was  discovered in outer space in 1961  by  means  of
       satellite born instruments.  We will now move onto the PLEIADES (The
       Seven Sisters) an  estimated 400 light years from here.   This group
       of stars is the basis of  mythology  in many countries....the  Greek
       Gods,  Australian Dreamtime....Chinese  mythology.   To  quote  from
       just a few Astronomers....

       Jose  Comas Sola made a special study of the Pleiades and discovered
       that they form a system, of which our sun is part  of  that  system,
       and also several  other  suns,  and  all  apparently, have their own
       Planetary systems.

       Freidrich Wilhelm  Bessel  showed  that  members of this group had a
       proper motion of  5.5  seconds  of  arc  per  century  in  the  same
       direction.

       Isaac Asimov..."We can assume that all the stars in this cluster are
                       the same chronological age."

       Edmund Halley, studying  the  position  of  the stars, noted that at
       least three stars were not in the spots recorded by the Greeks.
       The difference was so great that  it  was  unlikely  that either the
       Greeks or Halley could have made a mistake.  It seemed very clear to
       Halley that these stars moved within a system.

       Paul Otto Hesse also made a special study of this system,  of  which
       our sun is  a  part, and discovered, at absolute right angles to the
       movements of the suns, a PHOTON BELT  or  MANASIC RING,  a phenomena
       which scientists have not yet been able to reproduce with laboratory
       experiments.

       It takes our sun 24,000 years to complete an orbit, (of this system)
       and as seen by the diagram, it is divided into sections.  The 10,000
       years of darkness is the period as we know it now,  day  time, night
       time, the 2,000  year  period  of  all  light, again 10,000 years of
       darkness and 2,000 years of light.

       WE ARE NOW  POSED  TO ENTER THIS  PHOTON  BELT.   It  is  inevitable
       between now and the end of this century -  but it is inevitable!
       We have completed  the full circle and are back  at  the  beginning.
       It is described  in detail in your bible, by all books on mythology,
       by Nostradamus, and by modern day scientists.

       To  quote our  scientists....If the  Earth  enters  first  into  the
       PHOTON BELT, the sky will appear to be on fire, but be assured, this
       is cold light, so there will be no heat.  If the sun  enters  first,
       there will be immediate darkness, which, computed our speed through

                                      Page 2





       space, will last  110  hours.    The  interaction  between the Solar
       Radiation and the PHOTON BELT will  make  the  sky  look as if it is
       full of falling stars.  As the Earth enters this radiation belt, all
       molecules will become  excited, all atoms will change,  things  will
       become luminescent, THERE  WILL BE CONSTANT LIGHT.   There can be no
       darkness, not within the deepest cave, not within the human body.  A
       quick look at  your bible...."All  the  stars will fall from the sky
       and the sky will be no more....".

       It is expected that the rotation of the Earth may diminish a little.
       Because of the reduced Solar Radiation, the temperature  is expected
       to become cooler  and  the  ice caps are expected to extend to about
       latitude 40 in both hemispheres....your  history books will tell you
       that at least  five ICE AGES have been recorded, and  they  seem  to
       last about 2,000  years.   It  may be noted that world communication
       centers, fixed satellites,  US bases  and  experimental  sights  are
       within the 'safe zone'. Design or accident?

       What about you?    There   are  three  types  of   people   in   our
       cosmos...corporeal, like us, solid, human;....atmospherean, also
       solid to a   point,   but   the   molecular   structure   is   quite
       different;....ethereans, no mass at  all.   When we enter the Photon
       Belt, a normal healthy person is expected to feel a  jolt similar to
       putting your finger  in  a live light socket, and the transformation
       will be complete...you have just changed  from a Corporeal person to
       an Atmospherean person....("and ye shall be changed  to  immortality
       without the separation of death in the twinkling of an eye.")

       Theologians have written  at  great  depth  on Bible characters, and
       assert that they have lived in this  period  of  light.  The sky and
       atmosphere was different      and      apparently      it      never
       rained....Nostradamus, in his quatrain about the end of the world
       as we know  it,  in  1999...."and  it  will  rain no more, but in 40
       years, all will be normal."

       In aboriginal mythology it is said...."Men  were  different  to what
       they are now....we  had  a  bridge  to the stars..."  In  all  their
       stories if they  fell  out with the Chief or Elder, they fled to the
       sky.  So did the Greeks.  It appears  that  space  travel  is simple
       within the photon belt.

       The year 1962 was the year that we came within the  influence of the
       Photon Belt.  1962  was  a  year of great UFO activity.  Did we come
       within range of space travelers  using  the  Photon  Belt?    As  we
       hurtle closer and closer, will more UFO's look us  over  before  our
       rebirth into the years of LIGHT.  It would seem that this is already
       happening.

       Erich Von Daniken,  when  visiting South America, discovered a tribe
       with an object given to them by Sky  People  thousands of years ago.
       They were told to keep it clean and "when it hums like  thousands of
       swarms of bees,  we  will return."   It started humming softly three
       years ago (ie 1978).  A cosmic alarm clock alerting us to the coming
       of the light?

       It would seem  some civilizations  may  live  permanently  with  The
       Light.   When our Planet leaves this period of light  and returns to
       the 10,000 years  of  darkness, do THEY return to the LIGHT and wait
       our eventual re-entry.  It seems likely.  The Mayans departed

                                      Page 3





       hurriedly with the  message also of their return, which scholars say
       is now imminent.   Rock carvings  around  the  world  show  drawings
       similar to the system of Alcione.

       Ball lightning...a phenomena  about which little  is  known,  is  it
       perhaps little pockets of the Photon Belt?

       To all UFO  researchers,  these  craft  always  show  an interest in
       nuclear installations.  What will  happen  to  a  reactor within the
       Belt?   I think  our  scientists are way out ahead.   Photon  energy
       seems to be  the  energy  of  the future.  Many  UFO reports seem to
       indicate Photon rockets on experimental craft..."the headlights were
       at the back."   The  reports  at  hand   indicate  slow,  cumbersome
       craft..but within the  Photon  Belt,  I  think  we  have  craft  for
       immediate unlimited space travel.

       Because the radiation  of  our  sun  will  be modified by the Photon
       energy, is this why our scientists  only   pay  small lip service to
       the development of solar energy?

       Let us think about our planet coming out of the light  and  into the
       darkness.  Aboriginal mythology says "we were cast out into darkness
       and were much  afraid,  so  the  Gods gave us a Sun to warm us and a
       moon to see at night."

       If the ice caps from within the  light  years,  then  the  increased
       Solar radiation when leaving the belt must surely melt  the ice ....
       Floods.  If it  does  not  rain  within  this period of light, it is
       understandable why Noah was so awed  by  the  sight  of  that  first
       rainbow.  The Gilgamesh  talks  of  a  great  flood,   but   it  was
       apparently about 10,000 years before Noah's flood.

       We have thought  about  our world and the effect on a single person,
       but what about humanity as a whole?   It  is  conceivable  that many
       people will not survive the initial jolt if they  are  not  prepared
       for it.  If  the  ice  extends  to latitude 40, that covers half the
       USA, and most of Europe and Asia.  That is a lot of people without a
       home.  Will they be accepted in  other  countries?    In  a  limited
       space of fertility, will it be possible to support untold millions?

       I think not.  And so tomorrow . . . . . . . .
