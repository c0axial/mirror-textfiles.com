                   The Story behind Vangard Sciences and the
                       Generation of the KeelyNet System

            Vangard Sciences    (KeelyNet   sponsors)  was  organized  in
       December of  1986 in Dallas, Texas  as  an  alternative  means  of
       communication regarding  the more science based  relationships  of
       metaphysics  and   the   paranormal.   Kay West suggested the name
       (Vangard)  after  much deliberation   among   a  group  of friends
       meeting at  Ron  and  Kays  house.   The  spelling  is intentional
       to prevent any collision with other VangUards (with a U).

            Our original   purpose   was to present  public presentations
       in the form of lectures and   workshops,   perform  basic research
       and practical  development in various   scientific   and   pseudo-
       scientific disciplines   and provide regular meetings  for  anyone
       seeking  to  be actively involved in the study of the more unusual
       aspects of science.

            For our first year, 1987, we sponsored  a  monthly lecture on
       a variety of topics.  These lectures  involved  local  and outside
       speakers who    covered   such  topics  as   pyramids,    dowsing,
       acupuncture,  electromagnetic  healing,  Keely, alchemy, sonics in
       relation to   planetary  and  astrological  influences  and  other
       diverse subjects.

            Also during that first year, in conversations over  the years
       with my friend and collaborator  Dale  Pond,  editor and publisher
       of the  Journal  of  Sympathetic  Vibratory  Physics   (the  Keely
       newsletter),  we  had discussed sponsoring a Symposium on the work
       of John Keely.

            I (Jerry)  had  been  studying  Keely since the late 60's and
       Dale had been actively involved since  1985.   We  both  felt that
       a gathering of  people interested  in  Keely  was overdue by about
       one hundred years.  At the time we originally discussed this, Dale
       was living  in Virginia.  By 1988, he was in process  of moving to
       Colorado.

            I (Jerry)  made  the  decision  to  take on the financial and
       organizational responsibilities of the  First Annual International
       Keely Symposium  to  be held in the Dallas area.

            Dale arranged  for  the speakers and some advertising while I
       organized local advertising, the   location   of   the  Symposium,
       the speakers  hotel, mementos and the lunch.

            The 1st Keely Symposium was held on August 1st,  1987  at the
       Richardson Civic  Center.  The  event  was covered by Dennis Stacy
       a contributor and now writer for OMNI magazine.  The story on  the
       Keely Symposium did not appear until the 1988 April issue.

            Our second  year  led  us   to   an  opportunity to lease  an
       educational program  on  Tesla  which we felt might  allow  us  to
       generate sufficient  capital  to  establish  a  trust  fund.   The
       interest from the trust would be used to finance our activities.


                                    Page 1
            We called  the  program, ZAP DALLAS.  It made use of a 6 foot
       Tesla coil capable of generating electrical discharges up  to  12
       feet in length.

            With the  help of Dale Pond,  we  brought the Tesla equipment
       from Denver to Dallas after leasing a movie theater   in   Garland
       as  our public display location.  We removed several rows of seats
       in order to build a custom stage for the Tesla demonstrations.

            These one  hour  demonstrations  involved a running monologue
       of Teslas' life and accomplishments paralleled by  experiments  to
       demonstrate various  Tesla  coil effects.  The effects ranged from
       simple discharges  to the use of  a  Faraday  cage.    Our   grand
       finale  involved   our  demonstrator  (MR.   ZAP)  standing  on  a
       special  table   which was connected to the Tesla coil output.  We
       then sent a reduced output on the  order  of  900,000 VAC over his
       body to stream off his hands, tongue or any other  pointed member.
       Needless to say, people were fascinated by the effects, especially
       the passing of electricity over a live body.

            We ran   the   program for the month of March with the little
       advertising we could afford.   Our attendance totalled  about  500
       people during  that period.  We  lost  out miserably although many
       people kept  coming back  with other friends.  Many   of  our most
       ardent patrons  were  engineer/science  types  who appreciated the
       work which such a project entailed.

            After packing up the ZAP DALLAS  theater  location,  we found
       that OMNI magazine had published   an   article  in  the April 88'
       issue  on Tesla.   Our final opportunity came from  an  invitation
       by TEXAS  ELECTRIC  (the  local  power company) to serve  as their
       exhibit for the 28th Annual Texas  Energy  Science  Symposium  for
       High Schools at the University of Texas at Austin.
            We packed  up  the  equipment  and   drove   to   Austin   on
       Tuesday, June  7,  1988.   On  arrival  Dr.  Austin  and Dr. Klein
       assisted us  in   the  setup  of   our  equipment  in  a   medical
       auditorium  which had a capacity of 450 people.   On  testing  the
       equipment, the humidity must  have  been  near perfect as we got
       the full  discharge   length   of  12  feet.   Dr. Austin and  Dr.
       Klein  were thinking the unit  would   be  small  with  discharges
       on the order of 4 to 8 feet.  On seeing this test, Dr. Austin  was
       quite  excited  and wanted  to purchase one for  the  UTA  Physics
       Department.

            The show began at 7:30 and was scheduled to end at 8:30,  our
       standard one  hour  program.   The room was packed and people were
       standing against the walls and doors.   Later estimates by our  UT
       sponsors said  the room probably contained 500 people,  more  than
       they had ever seen in any  of their programs in this room.
            During the   show,   we   garnered   extended   applause  and
       questions.  The enthusiasm of the  people  induced  us to  perform
       extra experiments for their participation which led to a prolonged
       question/answer  session.  The  show was finally  over   at  10:00
       PM.   Two  and  one half hours on Tesla and the unusual aspects of
       science.

            On packing  up  the  next  day,  many  people  who we did not
       know, insisted on patting us  on  the back or shaking our hands to

                                    Page 2
       congratulate us   on   the  show.  Later, a  June 29th letter from
       Dr. Dale Klein states, "The responses  we  have received regarding
       your presentation  have been very favorable.  I  am  certain  that
       your comments inspired these  future  scientists and engineers.
       Thank you for a fine presentation."

            Our staff  at  our  greatest  moment  were Jerry Decker,  Ron
       Barker, Chuck Henderson and Wayne Fowler.  Wayne is a professional
       actor who is interested in the Vangard  Sciences and who served as
       our narrator.  Jerry is Director,  Ron  is  Business  Manager  and
       Chuck is the Vangard Secretary.

            After the return of the Tesla equipment  to   Denver  in  the
       month  of  December  1988,  we   decided to redefine our goals and
       means  of achievement.  We obviously  needed   a space in order to
       build up a workshop.  Lectures were fine for exchanging  ideas
       but  resulted    in    little   or   no practical  implementation.
       For that  purpose,  I  (Jerry) decided to  buy  a house.   We also
       needed some  form  of  mass communication  ability  to  spread the
       word on Keely and our interests.  Thus, the idea  for KeelyNet was
       born.

            On attending  lectures and Conferences  both locally in other
       states, we  have made many interesting  contacts  and  information
       exchanges.  From   these  exchanges,  we  see   many   overlapping
       fields  of  study  which  need  to be made freely available to all
       interested parties.

            Our present intentions involve  the   support  and continuing
       expansion of the KeelyNet system, the buildup of  a  workshop  for
       experimentation including documentation of our work in the form of
       videotapes or  textual  descriptions  capable  of  being listed on
       KeelyNet or otherwise distributed.
            We have  come to realize over  the past few years that there
       is a problem which should influence all experimentation.  That is
       the problem of ecology and global warming.

            We meet  many  people  working  on health related activities.
       If  the  planet  dies  or is crippled, health will not matter.  In
       the very near future (projections  range  from   10  to  20  years
       MAX),  you  can not step outside without a head to  toe  covering,
       special  sunglasses   to  reduce  UV  to  the  eyes  and  probably
       breathing  apparatus.   Drought  will  cause massive  famine,
       reduction in  public  services   including  energy  and  petroleum
       products.  Air  conditioning failures from no power,  no   gas  or
       electricity for cooking when you can find edible food.

            A critical juncture is approaching and we must all take steps
       to  slow it,  prevent  it  or  have  the  option of  escaping from
       it.  How  can  we  do this?  Focus our research on FREE ENERGY and
       LEVITATION.  Keely is one of the  ways.   We  have  collected much
       documentation on  many modalities and techniques.   It  is time to
       spread the word and ACTIVELY WORK for practical implementations.

            For that   reason,  Vangard  Sciences  will actively work  on
       FREE  ENERGY devices as well  as  LEVITATION.   The  KeelyNet will
       serve  as a means of distributing our collection of information to
       the widest possible audience at  the least possible cost.  We also

                                    Page 3
       mail out documentation  to people whom we know to be distributors
       and/or networkers for this type of information.

                 The following is an Update on April 10, 1990
                  Recent developments require that we further
               focus our goals on the following specific areas.

         The purpose for the establishment of KeelyNet is to allow the
         rapid and free exchange of information relating to :

                   1)  free energy technologies
                   2)  anti-gravity technologies and techniques
                   3)  unusual methods of ecology
                   4)  alternative health systems including anti-aging
                   5)  UFOs, what are they, can we duplicate them
                   6)  the free release of the work of John Keely
                       covering Sympathetic Vibratory Physics
                   7)  contacts and notices for symposia & conferences
                   8)  future conferences on biology, ecology, free
                       energy, anti-grav and others of interest

           We of  VANGARD  SCIENCES  realize that our planet  is  rapidly
           coming to  a point of no return and that ONLY THROUGH THE FREE
           EXCHANGE of  information   relating   to   the  above  topics,
           especially free energy, anti-grav, ecology and  health will we
           survive as the race of Man.

           Our primary   focus  is  therefore  on  these  topics  with  a
           particular emphasis on the work of John Worrell Keely in the
           area of Vibrational Physics.

              We believe that the computer is the ideal means to
            efficiently distribute information on the above topics.

                We also believe that the three most destructive
                     modes of thought can be reduced to :

                            GREED - POWER  and EGO.

         For these reasons, we openly share all information that we have
         with all interested parties unless otherwise restricted by the
         donors of sensitive information.

         Responsibilty for  the  use   or   abuse   of  such  information
         invevitably falls on the user.




                                    Page 4

         We are currently gathering information which will point to a
         hybridized system for sustaining a HOME!  This system will
         include the following :

             1)  A free energy or over-unity device capable of
                 providing a minimum of 10 KW of electrical energy per
                 unit with the least high-tech requirements possible

             2)  A device for purifying water and air for use in homes

             3)  A device for condensing water directly from the air
                 with cool air as a byproduct

             4)  Advanced hydroponic and agricultural techniques for
                 growing the greatest quantity and quality of food
                 crops in the least space and with the least attention

             5)  Techniques for increasing the size and quality of meat
                 sources such as fowl, beef, pork and fish

             6)  More efficient, yet palatable and health sustaining
                 foodsources which do not require the destruction of
                 lower life forms including plants and animals

             7)  Weather modification techniques (centralized) to
                 minimize drought, freezing and wind induced damage

             8)  Techniques for generating light, heat and motor power
                 which are not necessarily electrically driven

             9)  Health technologies which will restore an organism to
                 its optimal energy and functions and which can be
                 located in the home for use as required

            10)  Transportation techniques which take advantage of flight
                 by using levitation brought about by magnetic, sonic,
                 electric or air moving technologies

          The above principles must be non-polluting, safe for humans in
          proximity with such technologies and as low-tech as possible.
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
                 The following is an Update on April 25, 1992

          Despite  our intentions  to maintain a low profile, we have now
          been  the  subject of  at least  two  magazine articles (to our
          knowledge.)  One was the December 91' SPY magazine, the  latest
          was  a  short  article  in  the  April  92' Boardwatch magazine
          ( devoted   to  computer   bulletin  boards ),   both  national
          publications.   One  of  the  articles  begins with "Forget the
          Time/Life  Book Series,  give  KeelyNet  a  call  and  you  can
          generate several books of your own."

          From our friends down in Australia, many of our files have been
          distributed  throughout  that  country  and  in  fact some were
          picked up by the Australian  company - BEYOND 2000,  which airs
          on the Discovery channel.  They sent  a letter complimenting us
          on what  they had seen  to date and said just from that limited
          information  they  could  generate  2 years of shows for BEYOND

                                    Page 5
          2000!  In fact, one of our files led to the recent airing of an
          interview  and  demonstration  with  Sandy  Kidd, inventor of a
          Gyroscopic Levitation System.  We currently have that video for
          study.

          In addition, they sent a check for the purchase of our complete
          disk  set of  text files  which we began selling in 1991.  This
          was to  reduce  phone costs from having to dial up and download
          all  our files.  We  conservatively estimate  such an operation
          would cost  at  least $200  in phone  costs alone and our files
          continue to grow on a monthly basis.

          And  for  1992,  we  have  established  relations  with Mr. Per
          Lindgren, sysop of the GAS STATION in Gaevle, Sweden.  He asked
          to become  the official Eastern European KeelyNet Affiliate and
          we  have  agreed  to  exchange  files  on  a regular basis.  It
          currently costs  $1 per minute to link with Sweden.  This opens
          up  entire new vistas since the dissolution of the Soviet Union
          has allowed many scientists and  researchers  to speak on their
          projects.  Per  has  graciously  volunteered  to  translate our
          files into  Scandinavian  and Russian,  as  well as translating
          their  files into  English which will be mailed to us.  So that
          offers tremendous new avenues of exploration.

          We currently have an image capture board, video duplication and
          editing/enhancement  abilities, image  enhancement abilities, a
          new FAX board for the  computer and  will soon have a 9600 BAUD
          modem courtesy of  Mr. Guy Resh.  In addition, we have received
          some fascinating  videos as  well  as text documents which will
          continue  to  be added to KeelyNet  for  public distribution to
          those  wishing to  keep up  on what  is going on in the various
          fields as encompassed by KeelyNet.

          Our  contacts have spread considerably over  the past two years
          and  we have  learned much  from those  who have  so graciously
          shared their  own particular  stash of  information as  well as
          some of their research findings.

          On July 15, 1992, KeelyNet will  celebrate its  3rd Anniversary
          since it was first begun in 1988.

          We consider ourselves fortunate to have  had the opportunity to
          converse and exchange information with so many excellent minds.
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
                 The following is an Update on November 18, 1992

       In  August, we  purchased a  full page scanner that is intended to
       allow  us to scan  in black  and white  images such as patents and
       circuit  diagrams.  It  can scan  64 grey  scale and has a 50 page
       sheet feeder.  One  of our users  sent us OCR software to allow us
       to  directly scan  in and  translate documents  into ASCII useable
       text files.

       We  also have  another system  we are  working on  which will have
       about 106 MB of free disk space.  It will run the newer  WILDCAT 3
       software and will have 22 file sections and 13 conference areas.

       As of November 16th, we have the 9600 modem online and functioning

                                    Page 6
       at 9600 BAUD.  However,  we are  "fine-tuning"  the initialization
       codes to allow the maximum connection of 14,400 bps.  When the new
       system is ready, the 9600 modem will be  connected to it also.  It
       is quite amazing to watch the  transfer  of  large amounts of data
       at  such high rates of speed.  I  watched  as about 300KB of files
       were sent in less than 6 minutes...incredible.  At  this rate, all
       of our files could be  completely  downloaded  in about  two and a
       half hours.

       Ron  has come  up with  some  great  programs  which  allow  image
       enhancement as well as made a contact who let us scan in the KEELY
       lab  and equipment pictures as high resolution images.  These will
       be listed on the new system also.

       All KeelyNet text files have always been free to everyone, however
       since  we have  been acquiring new equipment to further expand our
       system and abilities,  the new system will have an upper technical
       section that is accessible  ONLY  to those  who subscribe for this
       technical access.  The rate will be $30.00 per year with unlimited
       downloading.   The subscription accessible  section  will  include
       patents, circuit  diagrams and other technical information.  Users
       who contribute  to  our  system  will be granted full access since
       they have proven themselves to be  sharers of  information.  There
       are  a few who simply  take all that  they can  without sharing or
       otherwise contributing in any fashion.

       Recently  (began  October  1992),  we  began  having  meetings  of
       interested individuals to discuss  various  subjects and  exchange
       information.   We have  intentionally kept these meetings small so
       that  they  would  not turn  into a mob.  So  far, we have had two
       meetings ranging in size from 24 to 28.

       We plan to  continue these monthly meetings on a regular basis for
       the express purpose of exchanging information and ideas.
