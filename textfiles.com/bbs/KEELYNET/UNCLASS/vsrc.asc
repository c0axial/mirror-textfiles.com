         The following is the general idea for the VS Research Center.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today's Date         : January 27, 1995
Original Plan        : February 8, 1992
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Proposal for Vanguard Sciences Research Center

The following is the essence of a proposal that was being worked on for the
establishment of a multi-purpose alternative science research, development and
educational facility to be operated under the auspices of Vanguard Sciences.

The facility was intended to become self-sufficient and profitable based on a
five year plan. There has to be some form of longevity to attract the type of
people needed to work with us.  The one time investment requires 12 million
dollars which would be used to :

   1) purchase the building and property, fit to comply with zoning codes
      (estimated one time cost 1.5 million)
   2) modify, repair and finish out the interior, exterior and grounds
      (estimated one time cost 800k)
   3) furnish the interior, including conference room seating, etc.
      (estimated cost 200k + (1417 seats*100=150k)=350k)
   4) equip the machine, wood and plastics fabrication shops,
      (estimated one time cost 300k)
   5) equip the other centers with computers, copiers, audio/video equipment,
      sound systems, merchandise/books, etc.
      (estimated one time cost 500k)
   6) ensure operating and personnel costs for the 5 year period (based on a
      minimum of 20 to 30 employees for full time operation),
      (6M over 5 years)
   7) allow for consultant and peripheral information and materials gathering,
      (2 million over 5 year period)
   8) and to sustain all operations for the five year period or until the
      Center becomes self-sufficient.
      (utilities, etc. costs over 5 years 500k)

This comes to around 11.95M over the five year period.
To sustain the Center for 3 years, it comes to about 8.25M.

This all came about at the suggestion of a friend who was involved with a
grantsmanship program (based out of Michigan).  He suggested I put together a
summation of what I WANTED TO DO and how it would be accomplished.  This was
to be based on many interests and contacts in various fields. Before the
proposal was drawn up in its entirety, the grant contact had closed down
operations and the project went into abeyance.

Vanguard Sciences/KeelyNet has the contacts and information that could lead to
ASTOUNDING ADVANCES not only with new discoveries but also new technologies
and devices that could be marketed. There are also leads to many "lost"
discoveries that need serious modern research efforts. If it could be done
then, it can be duplicated and USED NOW.

Inventors need backing and support from honest trustworthy sources.  People
need low cost devices and/or freely available information to build their own,
in areas not covered or otherwise considered by the popular media, and various
other researchers are in need of funding for projects which haven't a chance
through normal channels.

                                        Workshops/Training
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose of Grant

To establish a multi-faceted research, design, application and educational
center where the main function is to provide a workshop and information center
for aspiring inventors. The center will assist in the prototyping, patenting
and marketing of those ideas which have social, commercial or uplifting merit
as determined by a review board.  In addition, the facility will provide
conference space, research resources and educational opportunities for the
interested public.

These opportunities are intended to expand scientific comprehension and to
promote an ever increasing interest in practical maverick science explorations
through the availability of information, programs, demonstrations,
presentations and other resources relating to science and alternative science.

Associated activities will include conferences, an alternative science BBS
based on the KeelyNet format, a newsletter, bookshop, reading room for hard to
find materials, audio/video/graphics capabilities for documentaries, museum,
giftshop and snack shop, as initial areas of endeavour.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building Site

The building under evaluation is located at 3636 North Buckner (loop 12) at
the I-30 intersection. It was at one time a FedMart retail outlet and was last
occupied by a flea market type of setup known as the BAZAAR.

The property is on 9.012 acres, 84,960 sq. ft. of which is occupied by the
building. The parking lot consists of asphalt paving. The building takes the
form of an open warehouse 30 feet high. The asking price is almost 1 million.

A strip of undeveloped land approximately 1/3 mile long and 500 yards wide
sits directly behind this building for future development/expansion.

It is approximately 5 minutes from downtown Dallas, 20 minutes to Love Field
and 30 minutes to DFW International Airport.  There are hotels, motels and
eating establishents nearby.

The activities of such a center as detailed in this proposal are such that a
large metro area would best serve the majority of the functions.  Particularly
the conferences, local presentations, workshops, educational aspects to serve
a much wider public body as well as all the benefits associated with the
Dallas and Texas reputations (notorieties to some views).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Primary Activities (Profit Centers)

    Inventor R & D        Library/Archive          Reading Room Archive
    KeelyNet BBS          Data Search Services     Video/Audio/Graphics Serv.
    Patent Library        Conference Center        Computer Database Service
    Publishing            (4 conference rooms)     Research-Info/Experiment
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inventor R & D

- Technical Services -

Assists inventors with machine shop, wood and plastic fabrication services,
electronic research equipment, design services, technical assistance and
consultation.   Once the project is selected for backing, VSRC will provide
research assistance and backing to develop a working, reproducible prototype.

A standard agreement is drawn up with the inventor and VSRC.  This agreement
will include a Non-Disclosure form and a contract authorizing 25% of the
patent rights to VSRC and a 2 year period to market the product.

- Marketing Option -

VSRC will perform a patent search and secure a patent in the inventors name
with a 25% royalty assigned to VSRC.  Manufacturing and Marketing services
will also be available for an additional 15% for a total of 40% of any fees
earned from the invention/discovery royalties.  The remaining 60% of the
patent royalties and the invention credit belongs to the inventor.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Information

- KeelyNet BBS -

An online subscription database offering a wide range of text files and useful
programs. Subscriptions would be $50 per year with unlimited access or 30
minutes daily FREE ACCESS. We will also use 800 lines to enable subscribers
to call without having to incur long distance charges.  KeelyNet would also
provide graphic images, schematics, projects, etc. and will run at the highest
possible speed.  It would also provide links to the InterNet and other
services.

- Patent Library -

Complete patents, abstracts and registry, available on microfilm and/or CDROM.
Referenced by title and abstract for ease of search on new patents, subjects
or patent applications.

- Library/Archive -

Extensive library of technical books relating orthodox and particularly
alternative approaches to energy, gravity, field forces, ecology, biology,
health, nutrition, etc. Books are PRECIOUS and will NOT be accessible to the
public. Instead, photocopies and/or CDROMs will be made of each book which can
be "checked" out from a central desk. The information will be in photocopy
form or on disk and can be studied or copied by researchers using the VSRC
reading room.

- Data Search Services -

Patent or information searches on specific subjects can be contracted for a
standard rate from our complete library and database links. Search yields can
then be compiled and furnished as customized information packages.

- Conference Center -

One main auditorium capable of seating up to 700 people. A second auditorium
with a seating capacity of 325. Two other smaller auditoriums each with a
seating capacity of 195 that can be combined for a total seating capacity of
390.  These auditoriums can be rented for symposiums, conferences or
presentations.  Local hotels provide convenient rooming accomodations as well
as shuttles to and from the targeted facility.  A single conference spanning
from 3 to 5 days can easily net $50,000 with a paid attendance of 500 people
at $150 to $200 per admission. This is after furnishing speaker accomodations,
travel and presentation fees. Local events can also be scheduled for further
income and educational opportunities.

- Reading Room -

Open to the public much like a Christian Science Reading Room.  The idea is to
allow access to a wide range of books and documents without the need of users
to invest thousands of dollars researching multiple or specific subjects.

Access to the Reading Room would be at reasonable daily, weekly, monthly or
yearly rates.  Users are not allowed to access books.  Attendants will
retrieve the requested volume and be responsible for the return of the folio
in proper order to the correct shelf location.  Photocopies of selected
material will be made BY THE USERS at their OWN discretion and at a charge of
five cents per page.

- Computer Database Service -

Will include a wide range of technical information, design programs for
research support, math programs and known technologies/procedures detailed and
listed in a computer database.  All this will be linked into a central LAN.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are 3 technology groups that need to be kept as free from monopolization
and secrecy as possible.  They have been discovered and hidden or suppressed
many times over.

   1)  A practical free energy system using hydrogen, magnetic, sonic,
       electrostatic, Lenz law/back EMF, neutral center tapping, virtual
       flux/scalar/ZPE tapping, heat pumps or other F/E technologies which can
       be easily and economically duplicated for practical use.
   2)  A working anti-grav system or mass 'weight' reduction that uses
       electrical, sonic or other forces to provide lift and propulsion for
       transport over the planet or in space.
   3)  A working system which heals the body of disease and/or rejuvenates an
       organism to a youthful, healthy condition for a duration determined not
       by chance or "natural death", but by the wishes of the subject.

There are hundreds of other technologies BEYOND these which are subject to
research and development FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE of yielding INCOME PRODUCING
technologies.  The Vanguard Sciences Research Center concept is much like the
17th century Cavendish Group, created by Henry Cavendish of Scotland and which
spawned what is now recognized as the INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.  Edison also
tried the same idea but it was distorted by ego, power and greed.

We and our Associates plan to be a major part in the modern revolution that
will free much of humanity from the chains of central sources. This of course
includes petroleum for fuel, electricity for power, mass transport and health
monopolies.  We foresee off the shelf technologies that can be purchased and
self installed or installed by teams that are hired for the purpose.

Maintenance of these self-sustaining, freedom producing technologies can be by
the user or through a service contract. Society will adapt and fluorish as
more of these technologies inevitably come online. It is up to those WHO CAN
SEE FARTHER than just the possession of money or "things" who will help to
make this a reality.

We are exploring various techniques for funding, some of which are quite
bizarre. The bottomline is not HOW such a project got the funding, but the
simple fact that IT DID and would be blooming despite the flamers and negative
comments. The much ballyhooed cliche of "paradigm shift" is a mild reference
to what will happen as these technologies come online and are available to the
public.  A simple description of how it WILL be :

Modular homes can be located anywhere on the planet, mountaintops, valleys,
deserts. Totally INDEPENDENT of outside power sources, waste removal,
communications, or food sources.  We have accumulated information that will
lead to :  1) an over-unity/free energy source within the home to provide
              a) air conditioning/heat
              b) power for electronics or appliances
              c) lights and other uses for electricity
           2) a means of precipitating water directly from the ambient air,
              thus providing water for drinking, light irrigation, showering,
              laundering, and cleaning purposes
           3) reduction and/or negation of gravity for flying vehicles
           4) redirection of gravity and other forces for thrust
           5) disease cancellation through phase conjugation, resonance
              patterns and other advanced energetic techniques
           6) suspension or reversal of aging
           7) altering body patterns to optimize the body
           8) waste and garbage elimination through vaporization
           9) localized weather control from a central source, (this is
              necessary because the system must be central to ensure
              coordination with a global overseer to minimize global weather
              chaos
          10) instantaneous A/V and data communications over essentially
              infinite distances via scalar/motional nested images
          11) other less spectacular advances

There is much to be done, but it takes money, coordination and sharing of
information to make this happen. Time will tell if we are successful in all or
part of what we COULD accomplish.  One other point, don't even mention Non-
Profit. We checked into all of what that entails, and it is out of the
question.

When you incorporate as a Non-Profit entity, the government has the right to
inspect your activities at random, you have to fulfill ONLY the purpose for
which you were established and if you choose to get into areas which could
"affect the national security" or otherwise endanger vested interests (public
utilities such as power companies, airlines, etc.) you are subject to
immediate confiscation of all property, funds, etc. So, if you know someone
with a spare 12 million wanting to do some good, let's talk. No flakes or
opportunists please, this is a special project for special people.

There are no doubt one or more people out there who CAN SEE what this could
all bring about, not only socially but also by altering governments because
there would be no central control structures.  A simple trust fund, an estate
or inherited trust, there are ways to keep the primary funds and just let us
use the interest for the center.

The 12 million could be broken down over a 5 year period to 2.4 per year or
less if we scale it down.  There are numerous other locations and options, all
of which are open to discussion.  We all are getting older and time passes us
by.  Do we die knowing what we COULD have done?  The large scale plan was to
ensure some degree of stability which would attract quality associations and
build confidence and trust.

Rather than resort to scams, crooked schemes or nefarious partners, I have
chosen to be patient and rely on the universe to provide that window of
opportunity.  I just hope it happens before many of us are too old, ill or
dead to do anything useful.

Vanguard Sciences has have been offered libraries of specialized information
as well as equipment should a stable facility be created that could ensure the
information was open to study by the interested public.  It is a shame to see
them sold off for pennies or destroyed by people who do not recognize there
value.

If you know of anyone who can see the tremendous potential and the massive
positive effect that could be rendered by sponsoring such an effort, please
give them a copy of this file.  It is not a grant, but a loan to be paid back
as the center begins to become profitable, primarily through marketed consumer
oriented inventions but there are also other avenues for profit centers.
