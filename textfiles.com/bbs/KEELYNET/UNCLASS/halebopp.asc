Because of all the curiousity about the mysterious object said to be
approaching our solar system (some say it is inside the orbit of Pluto, the
following info might be of interest.

              Comet Hale-Bopp, for the Non-Astronomer (pages 6-7)

The Hale-Bopp comment (C/1995/01) was discovered on 23rd July 1995 by Alan
Hale, New Mexico, and Thomas Bopp, Arizona.

The orbit of this comet is of a long period - approximately 3,250 years.  It
has travelled through the inner solar system before - that is, it is not a new
comet from the Oort Cloud.  It's orbit is a very long, stretched-out ellipse,
and the comet is part of our solar system in orbit around our Sun.

Comet Hale-Bopp is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun (perihelion)
at 15.4 hours UTC on 1st April 1997 (no fooling!).  At that time it will be
about 0.913 astronomical units from the Sun (one AU = about 93 million miles
or 150 million kilometers - the distance between the Sun and the Earth), or
roughly 85 million miles (137 million kilometers) from the Sun.  This is not a
particularly close approach to the Sun, but any comet that comes within 1 AU
of the Sun has a chance of putting one a nice show.

The comet will make its closest approach to the Earth on 23rd March 1997.  At
that time it will be more than 120 million miles (194 million kilometers) from
Earth - not even a very close approach!  Will the comet 'cross' the Earth's
orbit?  Well, yes and no...  The comet will come closer to the Sun than the
Earth, but it will never actually physically cross any point in space that is
occupied by the Earth - so it can't hit the Earth!

The comet will be best seen from the southern hemisphere (and lower northern
latitudes) EXCEPT when it is expected to be at its brightest.  In March and
April 1997 it will only be easily visible from the northern hemisphere.

There have been reports that this comet is very large.  Actually, the heart of
the comet - the nucleus - is obscured by the dust and gas that forms the head
of the comet.  Nobody knows how large the nucleus is.  We can't see it!  The
nuclei of comets range in size from a few miles (kilometers) or smaller, to
over 100 miles (160 kilometers) in diameter.  The brightness of the comet is
not always directly related to the size of the nucleus.  This is because,
typically, only a fraction of the surface of a comet's nucleus is active.  It
is possible that this comet has a small nucleus with most of its surface
emitting dust and gas.  It is also possible that this comet has a large
nucleus with only a small active region.  We just don't know.

                Comet Hale-Bopp, for the NEXUS Reader (page 7)

Many people have asked the question, "With all that gear out there, how come
the experts didn't discover Hale-Bopp first?"  Or did they?

What follows is a tidbit emailed to NEXUS.  Make of it what you will...

The Truth about Hale-Bopp
From the Art Bell Radio Web
Date : 7 Aug 1995
From : wmtim@aol.com (WmTim)

I work at an institution that studies data gathered from a number of 'outward-
looking' satellites.  We first saw Hale-Bopp on July 3rd.

We have determined that it has made a number of course-corrections since that
time.  Once we confirmed the data that first suggested these corrections,
government 'spooks' from some unidentified agency seized the data, and our
satellite links were shut down 'for maintenance'.

Never before have we lost all our links at once.  Our name for the 'comet' was
"Contact 070795B".  Use that name when asking questions and see the result you
get.

Vanguard Note

A friend recently informed me he had seen a photograph and email description
claiming that any InterNet user could access a web page which would allow the
user to program a large telescope to take up to 10 minutes of photos of any
region of space that was visible from the site.

The story goes that the fellow who wrote the email claimed he had programmed
the telescope to take a single 10 minute exposure somewhere around 2AM.  The
picture which was sent to him from the telescope showed a very large area
which blacked out the background stars.

My friend said he would try to locate that email and the picture which was
provided so that others could at least see it.  This was about two months ago
and he has not been able to find it again.  If anyone else has seen this, we
would be most interested in seeing the photo and/or the email that describes
it.  Thanks......................................................>>>  Jerry
