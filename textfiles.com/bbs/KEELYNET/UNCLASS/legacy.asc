       This interesting file  is from the Double Helix BBS.  It has much to
       say as to how young people view our  modern  society  and  what they
       perceive as a probable end result.

       Kind of gets one to thinking about what can we do to  try to inspire
       the younger folks.   How  many  times  have  you seen a Winnebago or
       camper with a  bumper sticker saying,  "We  are  spending  our  kids
       inheritance."  Although I know many people who were  left  little or
       nothing, they chose not to depend on any kind of windfall from their
       parents estate and so made it on their own abilities.  These are the
       ones I admire most..........................................Sysop

       "The Terrible Twenties"
       Smith-Rowsey

       Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to have been 20, my age, in
       the 60's. Back when you could grow  up,  count on a career and maybe
       think about buying a house. When one person could expect  to  be the
       wage earner for a household.

       In the space  of  one generation those dreams have died. The cost of
       living has skyrocketed, unemployment  has  gone up, going to college
       doesn't guarentee you can get a good job. And no one seems to care.

       Maybe it's because the only people my age that you older people have
       heard from are  those  who  * do *  make a lot of money:  investment
       bankers, athletes, musicians,  actors.   But  more  and  more  of us
       twentysomethings are underachievers  who loaf around the house until
       well past our college years.

       This is an  open  letter  to the baby boomers from  the   *  next  *
       generation.  I think  it's  time we did a little hitting back. Aside
       from the wealthy, none of you ever told your children, "Someday this
       will all be yours," and you're the  first  middle-class to fail that
       way. Did you  think we wouldn't care? Thanks a lot.   But  the  real
       danger lies in the way we've been taught to deal with failure: gloss
       over and pretend the problem doesn't exist.

       It's evidence you  never taught us to be smart -- you only taught us
       to be young.

       We are the  stupidest  generation  in  American history, we 20-year-
       olds. You already know that. We really  do get lower SAT scores than
       our parents. Our  knowledge  of  geography is pathetic,  as  is  our
       ability to deal with foreign languages and even basic math.

       We don't read  books like you did. We care only about image. We love
       fads.  Talk to any college professors,  and  they'll  tell  you they
       don't get intelligent responses like they used to,  when you were in
       school. We're perfectly mush-headed.

       You did this  to  us.  You praised your youth so much, you made sure
       ours would be carefree. It's not that  you didn't love us; you loved
       us so much, you pushed us to follow your idea of what you were -- or
       would like to have been -- instead of teaching us to be responsible.

       After legitimizing youthful rebellion you never let  us have our own
       innocence -- perhaps because Vietnam and Watergate shattered yours.
       That's why we're already mature enough to understand and worry about
       racism, the environment, abortion, the homeless, nuclear policy.

       But we were  also  fed  on the video culture you created to idealize
       your own irresponsible days of youth. Your slim-and-trim MTV bimbos,
       fleshy beer commercials, and racy  TV shows presented adolescence as
       a time only for fun and sex. Why should we be expected  to  work  at
       learning anything?

       Not that we're  not smart -- in some ways. We're street smart, David
       Letterman clever, whizzes at Nintendo.  We  can name more beers than
       presidents.  Pop culture is, to us, more attractive than education.

       I really don't  think  we  can  do this much longer.  Not  a  single
       industrialized country has  survived  since 1945 without a major re-
       evaluation of its identity except  ours. That's what you thought you
       were doing in the 60's, but soon gave way to chasing  the  dreams of
       the Donald Trump-Michael  Milken  get-rich-quick ethos --and all you
       had left for us was a bankrupt economy.

       The latchkey lifestyle you gave us in the name of your own "freedom"
       has made us a generation with missing  parents and broken homes. And
       what about the gays and Blacks and Hispanics and  Asians  and  women
       who you pretend to care so much about, and then forgot?

       It's not that  I'm  angry at you for selling out to the system. It's
       that there won't be a system for >ME<  to  sell out to if I want to.
       The money isn't there anymore because * YOU * spent it all.

       To be honest,  I can't blame you for all that's happened.  The  pre-
       eminence of new   technologies   and   the   turn  toward  cutthroat
       capitalism over the past two decades  would  have  happened  with or
       without the pecualarities of your generation.

       If I had  been  born  in the 50's, I too would have  been  angry  at
       racism and the  war  in  Vietnam.  But  that's not the same thing as
       allowing the system to unravel out of my own greed.

       Don't say you  didn't  start  the  fire  of  selfishness  and  self-
       indulgence, building it   up  until  every  need   or   desire   was
       immediately appeased. Cable  TV,  BMW's,  cellular phones, the whole
       mall culture has reduced us all to  12-year-olds who want everything
       ** > NOW! <** .

       I'm not in  love with everything your parents did, but at least they
       gave you a chance. As Billy Joel said "Every child had a pretty good
       shot to get at least as far as their  old  man got." For most of us,
       all we've been  left  with  are  the  erotic  fantasies,  aggressive
       tendencies, and evanescent funds of youth. Pretty soon we won't have
       youth * OR * money, and that's when we may get a little angry.

       Or maybe we won't. Perhaps you really have created a nation of mush-
       heads who will always prefer style over substance. If that's so, the
       culture can survive,  as  it seems to be doing with the bright smile
       of optimism breaking  through  the   clouds   of  decaying  American
       institutions. And then  you  really  will be the last  modern  smart
       generation because our  kids  will  be  even dumber, poorer and more
       violent than us.

       You guys will be like the old mule  at  the  end of Orwell's "Animal
       Farm," thinking about  how  great things used to be  when  you  were
       kids. You will  differ  from  your own parents in that you will have
       missed your chance to change the world  and  robbed us of the skills
       and money to do it ourselves.

       If there's any part of you left that still loves us  enough  to help
       us, we could really use it. And it's not just your last chance. It's
       our only one.
