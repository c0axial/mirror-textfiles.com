                           Freedom and a Piece of String

                                  by Conyers Read

       As I grow  old, I decide not to bother about things I can do nothing
       about.

       When I was young I spent much time  in search of the KEY which would
       UNLOCK ALL DOORS.  I never found it and have given  up  looking  for
       it.

       I do not regret  the  search.   It brought me into close aquaintance
       with a large company of good and great  men  and women.  But, so far
       as I am concerned, I find it more fruitful to direct my attention to
       those elements in this mysterious world around us which  are, or may
       be, subject to  human  control, those elements in which the creative
       force is the MIND OF MAN.

       There, if anywhere on this earth,  lies the hope of the future.  For
       that reason, I  believe, first of all, that IT IS  OUR  BUSINESS  to
       provide an environment  in  which  the  mind  of  man  can enjoy the
       MAXIMUM amount of FREEDOM to THINK,  to  EXCHANGE  THOUGHTS with his
       fellows, to produce the BEST THAT IS IN HIM.

       I admit no distinction between the WHITE mind and the BLACK mind, or
       the YELLOW mind  or  the BROWN mind, or the mind MALE  or  the  mind
       FEMALE.

       Wherever there is  a  mind  there is the POTENTIAL of great and good
       things.

       Freedom of the mind I put first of  all.   But  I recognize that men
       live together in  society  and  that  social  obligations  transcend
       individual interests.

       No one man's  freedom can be ALLOWED AT THE EXPENSE OF ANOTHER man's
       freedom.  What we  have  to aim at  is  the  MAXIMUM  OF  INDIVIDUAL
       FREEDOM consistent with the larger social interest.

       I believe that the finest exercise of freedom is IN  THE  SERVICE OF
       ONE'S FELLOW MAN.

       I  believe  that  we  spend  too  much of our leisure WATCHING OTHER
       PEOPLE WORK AND  PLAY,  at  the  ball  parks, in the theater, on the
       screen.

       In my opinion, the major satisfactions  of  life  proceed  from  the
       EXERCISE OF OUR OWN CREATIVE IMPULSES.

       For  this  reason  I  regret  the   increasing   REGIMENTATION   AND
       MECHANIZATION OF LIFE as a MENACE TO HUMAN GROWTH.

       It seems to  me, as I look back upon my own boyhood, that I got more
       fun out of a piece of string than  my grandchildren get out of their
       more elaborate and much more expensive gadgets.  You  can  really DO
       things with a piece of string.

       I believe in DEVOTION TO CAUSES outside ourselves and in the service
       of which we   are  cheerfully  ready  to  sacrifice  our  individual
       welfare.

       This, in its highest form becomes  religion,  though  many  men find
       their God in strange places and in strange company.

       I believe that  immortality  will  be  measured in  terms  of  what,
       through OUR OWN  WORKS or OUR OWN INFLUENCE, we pass on to those who
       follow us.

       I believe that there are standards  of  right  and  wrong,  though I
       think these standards are too often confused with what  is  socially
       proper or socially expedient.  I believe that these standards can be
       and should be defined.

       I regard it as one of the important FUNCTIONS of educators, from the
       PULPIT, in the  CLASSROOM  and  ON  THE AIR, to PRESENT, EXPLAIN and
       SUPPORT THESE STANDARDS.

       I believe that a life lived in accordance  with these standards will
       be a happy and a fruitful life.

          "It is not LIFE that matters, but the COURAGE we bring to it."
