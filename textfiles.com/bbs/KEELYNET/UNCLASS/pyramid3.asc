                                   Introduction

       Rather than bring     complex    mathematics     and     engineering
       impossibilities into play. I belive I can show how  pyramid building
       was done very  quickly  using  logic  with many thousands of workers
       rather then current beliefs that fail when tested.

       I, James Hartman have come up with 2 concepts that fit a quick build
       scenario.

                               Reservoir-Dam Theory

       Limestone was brought across and down the Nile River by barges.  A
       large water reservoir surrounded the area in which the pyramid was
       going to be constructed. Much like a pool area.

       The base of the pyramid was built and each level of limestone of the
       pyramid blocks was put in place by flooding the area to the level of
       the limestone was to be set.

       The blocks of pyramid stone were placed on barges and floated to the
       pyramid location and were pushed  off  the  barge  unto  the  rising
       pyramid.

       The slaves or workers would have the arduous task of bringing water
       to the reservoir  to  fill it. (On the other hand,  if  they  had  a
       system of hydraulics  and  flood  gates  then  the force of the Nile
       river may have filled up this reservoir.)

       The Dam and the pyramid were going  up  together  whatever the case.
       The dam would be constructed with sand and stone. To finish the

       pyramid the water  could then be lowered and the finishing stone and
       polish work could be started. Else  they  could break or release the
       dam and the water would return to the Nile depending  on their level
       of technology.

                                    Sand Theory

       Limestone was brought  across  and  down  the Nile River. Sand hills
       were built at each level of the pyramid  running  from  the river to
       the pyramid location.

       As each level  of stone was put in place the hill got  progressively
       taller and longer   in   order   to   maintain  unity  and  ease  of
       construction. Then the sand was lowered and finishing work would be
       completed as the sand was being removed.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       There is a hydraulic pump system that was developed using the CHEOPS
       pyramid as a model.  A patent was  issued for it by the inventor and
       it has been proven a workable model.

       The floating water method and sand ramps have also been suggested by
       other researchers and  written  up  in  several books  on  pyramids.
       James has done  some  nice drawings to illustrate these two possible
       methods.

       Of course, we here at KeelyNet know  they  were built using the Maht
       Heru sounding rods (tuning forks)...<g>...
