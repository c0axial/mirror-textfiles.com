       This article reminds  us of the warning of two Russian friends about
       3 years ago.  They live in Houston  and  continue to have very close
       contacts with their friends back in Russia.  From the very beginning
       of Glasnost, they told us to NOT BELIEVE A WORD OF IT.

       No matter what was said or done, their contacts say  much  of  it is
       designed to lull  the  world  into a sense of complacency.  The true
       Glasnost objective was not known at  that  time but indications were
       that a major power shift was about to occur.

       At the time, we felt they might be bitter and thought their feelings
       might be slightly  skewed.   In  light  of recent events  in  Russia
       leading to major   economic   problems,  splintering  into  multiple
       smaller countries and loss of the  confidence of the people, we felt
       this article might be of interest.

                   Administration blinded by love for Gorbachev
                                  by Mona Charen

       Radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh has coined the term  "Gorbasm" to
       capture the overwrought  enthusiasm  of  some  in  the  West for the
       Soviet leader.

       Here's a perfect example: Covering the resignation of Soviet foreign
       minister Eduard Shevardnadze,     a     CNN    reporter    described
       Shevardnadze's anguished warning  about  a  NEW  DICTATORSHIP.   But
       then, spectularly MISSING  THE  POINT,  the  reporter  lamented that
       Shevardnadze's departure would leave  Mikhail Gorbachev all alone to
       cope with this looming tyranny.

       Only someone blinded by "Gorbasm" would be capable  of  that kind of
       OBTUSENESS.  Yet belief in Gorbachev - while everyday more difficult
       to justify as  he stands athwart the democratic reformers, sidles up
       to the KGB,  and  RENEWS TIES to the  suffociating  Communist  Party
       nomenklatura - pervades  liberal (and Bush administration)  thinking
       about the Soviet Union.

       Andrei Sakharov's widow,  Elena Bonner, wears no such blinders.  She
       explicitly warns that Gorbachev  HAS  EMBARKED  ON  A  COURSE TOWARD
       DICTATORSHIP.  "The coup,"  she  told  Wall  Street   Journal,  "has
       ALREADY HAPPENED." He  has  amassed  more  power  than  any previous
       Soviet leader, and is undermining  even  the flimsy patchwork of law
       the USSR does maintain.

       By propping up Gorbachev with $1 BILLION in agricultural credits,

       the Bush administration  is  casting  its lot, AND OUR DOLLARS, with
       REFORM COMMUNISM rather TRUE REFORM.

       Why?  Some argue that subsidies to the Soviets are a bribe for
       their continued cooperation  in   the  gulf.   Others  believe  that
       Secretary of State James Baker and President Bush are  more  worried
       about potential chaos  in  the USSR than about a potential return to
       Stalinist repression.

       If so, they  are not alone.  Media  coverage  of  the  situation  in
       Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is dominated by  concerns  about
       the dark forces  the  collapse of communism may have unleashed.  CBS
       reporter Tom Fenton's comments last week were typical:

          "We all thought liberal democracy  was  the  natural successor to
           communism.  But...it really is NATIONALISM.  And NATIONALISM was
           the plague of the '30s and '20s."

       Others have devoted  enormouse  amounts  of  ink  and  air  time  to
       atavistic, anti-Semitic, and   anti-democratic   groups   that  have
       crawled out from  under  rocks in  the  Soviet  Union  -  frequently
       confusing them with nationalists.

       Indeed, since the violence between Armenia and Azerbaijan last year,
       ALL STRIFE in the Soviet Union involving nationalism  is  CAST  AS A
       PRIMITIVE BLOOD FEUD.

       Meanwhile, the real  story  is being obscured.  The real story about
       both Eastern Europe  and  the USSR  is  not  what  the  collapse  of
       communism has UNLEASHED, but what IT HAS DESTROYED.

       It is the  ECONOMIC  CATASTROPHE left in communism's  wake  that  is
       creating most (though not all) of the havoc in the East.

       And West.  WE  SHALL  NOT  BE  IMMUNE.  Indeed, after bleeding white
       with an arms race these past 45 years,  the  last  kick in the teeth
       from the old communist empire will be the ECONOMIC BURDEN OF BAILING
       THEM OUT.  The  formerly-communist  economies  are PRIMITIVE  BEYOND
       IMAGINATION.

       It is the ECONOMIC HIROSHIMA that communism has created, and NOT THE
       NATIONALISTIC PASSIONS it unsuccessfully tamped, that represents the
       most urgent threat to order and peace.

       And the WORST  WAY  TO RESPOND is by SUPPORTING European communism's
       last tribune : Mikhail Gorbachev.
