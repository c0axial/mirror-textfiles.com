             The following letter appeared in the Fall 1992 quarterly
                    Journal of the American Society of Dowsers.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Dear Editor:

       Thank you for your nice note in answer to my letter to the American
       Society of Dowsers.

       As I previously stated in my letter, it is completely proper for the
       Society to have  an  official  stance   regarding  the  practice  of
       healing. It is  another  matter  completely to fail  to  uphold  the
       Constitution of this wonderful country.

       It is true  that  there  are  and  have been many instances in which
       caring individuals have been brought  to  trial,  and  even  sent to
       prison. Incarceration of patriots in every country is not new.
       However, the tide is turning in this country for two reasons.

            1.  More  people  are  becoming  aware of their  Constitutional
                rights, and
            2.  the abject failure of allopathic medicine in anything other
                than emergency conditions.

       It is area  number  one,  above,  that  I  am  addressing  here.  In
       October, 1990, Dr.  Ede  Koenig,   DN,   PhD  was  indicted  by  the
       California Attorney General  for  practicing  medicine   without   a
       license. She immediately  contacted Conrad LeBeau, who, like myself,
       has been urging people to use the  9th  and  10th  Amendments to the
       Constitution, as well as the State Constitutions,  and,  instead  of
       trying to defend   one's  self  against  the  charge  of  practicing
       medicine without a license, simply say the government has never been
       given the power to license anything!

       For the federal government to license would require a constitutional
       convention, and a proposed amendment submitted to each state

                                      Page 1





       legislature, and two-thirds  of the state legislatures would have to
       OK the measure.

       For the states themselves to license, if such a provision was not
       written in the original state constitution, a measure would have to
       be presented to the state's people, and a state-wide referendum
       taken to the people for a vote.

       So, back to Ede Koenig.  The judge dismissed the case and the state
       said it intended to refile charges. That was over 17 months ago, and
       no charges have been refiled. In  1989  the  Arizona legislature was
       poised to pass a law restricting anyone but dieticians  from  giving
       nutritional advice.  The  National  Health  Federation  sent Clinton
       Miller and others down, and they informed  the legislature that this
       was a restriction of the Constitutional rights of the  people.   The
       measure was overwhelmingly defeated.

       In 1991 the  Oklahoma  House  of  Representatives passed a bill that
       would fine anyone making dentures (except a dentist) $25,000.  I sat
       down and wrote a letter to every  state  senator  telling  them that
       such a law could be the cause of them being sued,  since  there  are
       federal laws that  fine  and  imprison  anyone  conspiring  to  deny
       someone their civil or Constitutional  rights.   I  received several
       letters from state  senators thanking me.  The measure  was  soundly
       defeated in the Senate.

       Now, I could go on and on, telling of instances in which the FDA and
       the AMA has  been slapped down in the courts.  The point of all this
       is that it all depends on how you  plead.   And, be warned!  It will
       be very difficult to get a lawyer to plead the constitutional issue,
       since they, the lawyers, WANT licensing!  They use this to eliminate
       competition.  So they won't ever tell you it is your  constitutional
       right.  They will say it is against the law, but the law is illegal.

       You must ignore the charge of practicing medicine without a license.
       You must say  that  this  is your right under the Constitution.  You
       must say that   the  America  Medical   Association   is   a   trade
       association, and to  allow  them to determine who can  practice  any
       type of healing  art  is a violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Laws,
       and a violation of the State Constitution  which prohibits the state
       establishing a monopoly.  OK?

       There are some losses and some wins on both sides.   The  main thing
       to remember is  that if good people do nothing, evil will invariably
       triumph.  In this case the loss might well be your life!

       We are fast approaching epidemics  in  both cancer and AIDS.  In the
       face of public  admission  of the AMA that they have  absolutely  no
       cure for AIDS,  and  with the news media just beginning to break the
       news that the  AMA has once again  lied  to  the  public  about  the
       extremely contagious nature of AIDS, public outrage  with the AMA is
       at an all  time  high.  Anyone  who has any ability to cure AIDS and
       cancer is now being sought after.   And  in the realm of dowsing, we
       can get the answer as to what will cure AIDS. In  fact,  we  already
       have dowsed out cures and used them successfully.

       How can anyone  with  any type of healing ability stand by and watch
       millions of people die, when he knows  how  to cure that individual?
       Will you?  If they are going to put people like myself, and you

                                      Page 2





       other dowsers who  are  healers,  in  prison  and  allow thieves and
       murderers to go free, perhaps we would be better off there.  We'd
       be much safer!

       Well, as Patrick Henry said, "Give me liberty or give me death!"

                                                     Charles Hallmark
                                                     Sulphur, Oklahoma
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       This was such an intriguing letter that I could not help but call up
       the writer out in Oklahoma on Saturday, October 30.

       Mr. Hallmark is  into  homeopathic   and   energetic   type  healing
       techniques and quite an interesting fellow.  We talked  for  over an
       hour and decided to swap some information in the field of biology.

       As you can  see, I pulled up the two Amendments (9 and 10) specified
       and they are quoted below.  I could  not  see  the relationship that
       Mr. Hallmark found to make it illegal to prosecute  a US citizen for
       "practicing medicine without  a  license",  so  I  called him up for
       clarification.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       As you know, we at KeelyNet rarely  get  involved in such issues but
       this letter was so fascinating that it demanded a  look  at  the  US
       Constitution and the ramifications of such interpretations.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       The comments that follow each of these Articles are mine (Jerry) and
       are my interpretation  of  the  Amendment  aided  by  Mr.  Hallmarks
       comments.  I asked Mr. Hallmark if he could recommend a good book on
       the Constitution with all the ramifications  of its various articles
       to modern society, but he said he knew of no such book.

       Although a man by the name of Mike Brown was placed  in  prison  and
       during that time  studied  the  Constition  in  some detail.  He now
       travels the country helping people involved in Constitutional rights
       violations with great success.  Mr.  Hallmark  said  that Mike Brown
       sometimes writes articles  that  appear  in  A.C.R.E.S  USA  out  of
       Missouri.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    ARTICLE IX

          The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not
       be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.
                        -----------------------------------
       Comment :  In  the  case  of  Article 9, it clearly states that just
                  because CERTAIN RIGHTS  are listed in the US Constitution
                  does not mean that there are not MANY OTHER  rights  that
                  US citizens  AUTOMATICALLY  enjoy and that are GUARANTEED
                  by their specific OMISSION from the U.S. Constitution.
                  And that  none  of  the   rights  so  listed  in  the  US
                  Constitution could  be  used  to  refuse   or   otherwise
                  diminish these Constitutionally UNSPECIFIED RIGHTS.
                  The fact  that  it  is  NOT SPECIFIED in the Constitution
                  DOES NOT MEAN that people CANNOT PRACTICE medicine, so by
                  the innate lack of a US  Constitutional  law  PROHIBITING
                  the practice of medicine without a license, no one can be
                  LEGALLY held or convicted on such a charge.
                  As the author claims, the FEDERAL government does not


                                      Page 3





                  CLAIM THE  RIGHT  to  issue licenses and therefore cannot
                  hold it's citizens to account for carrying out activities
                  which are   NOT   EXPRESSLY   PROHIBITED   OR   OTHERWISE
                  RESTRICTED by the U.S. Constitution.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    ARTICLE X

          The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution
       nor prohibited by  it  to  the States, are reserved  to  the  States
       respectively, or to the people.
                        -----------------------------------
       Comment :  As  to  Article  10,  the  States  are not PRECLUDED from
                  instituting such laws UNLESS  PROHIBITED from doing so by
                  the US Constitution.
                  Therefore, THE STATES have the right to  make  AMENDMENTS
                  to their  OWN STATE CONSTITUTION prohibiting the practice
                  of medicine or other such restrictive amendments.
                  This gives to each state  the  power to be as restrictive
                  or free as the populace of that state will allow.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       So, the outcome  of such a charge as practicing medicine  without  a
       license or other  charges  would  rely  on a specific Constitutional
       Amendment prohibiting such an activity in either the US Constitution
       or in the Constitution of the State in which the offense took place.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Another interesting point brought  out  by Mr. Hallmark in our phone
       discussion was in  regard  to  the ability of a jury  to  absolutely
       INVALIDATE a law  that  they felt was unjust or illegal.  This would
       seem to mean  that a jury could absolutely  ERASE  A  LAW  that  was
       passed by the  state or the United States SIMPLY BY  DECLARING  THAT
       THEY FOUND IT ILLEGAL.  And once this was done, a precedent had been
       set that essentially  DESTROYED  THE VALIDITY OF A GIVEN LAW and its
       subsequent invocation in further or future "violations".

       If this is  true,  then  once such  an  event  had  transpired,  any
       subsequent invocation of that law would equate to A VIOLATION of the
       Constitutional rights (either State or Federal, depending  on  which
       Constitution or Amendment  to  that  Constitution  applied)  of  the
       accused.

       It then follows  that any civil servant,  be  it  judge,  policeman,
       court officers, etc.   would   be   in  direct  violation   of   the
       Constitution and thus   be   subject   to   legal  action  for  such
       Constitutional violation against   another  citizen  of  the  United
       States.  (see Article VI below)
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                         ARTICLE VI    GENERAL PROVISIONS

           All Debts contracted and Engagements entered  into,  before  the
       Adoption of this  Constitution, shall be as valid against the United
       States under this Constitution, as under the Confederation.

           This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall
       be made in Pursuance thereof; and  all Treaties made, or which shall
       be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the

                  supreme Law of the Land;
                  and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby,


                                      Page 4





       any Thing in  the  Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary
       notwithstanding.

           The Senators  and  Representatives  before  mentioned,  and  the
       Members of the several State Legislatures,

                  and all executive and judicial Officers,

       both of the United States and of the several States,

                  shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation,
                  to support this Constitution;

       but no religious  Test shall ever be required as a Qualification  to
       any Office or public Trust under the United States.
       there                                                            are
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       As Mr. Hallmarks letter to his local Oklahoma Senators recounted and
       which put the fear of God into them by the simple reminder :

              there are  federal  laws   that   fine  and  imprison  ANYONE
              CONSPIRING (devising laws) to DENY someone
              their civil or Constitutional rights....

                    (backed up by the aforementioned Article VI
                        of the United States Constitution)
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       I have also  been  told  by  other sources that if  the  accused,  a
       representative of the  accused  or  an  outside  party  finds that a
       precedent is BEING USED which has either

                 BEEN INVALIDATED by a jury decision
                 OR is in direct violation

                 of EITHER the US Constitution
                 or a State Constitution,

                 AND makes the policemen, court officers,
                 judges and other involved public servants

                 AWARE OF THE VIOLATION of the precedent
                 or Constitutional violation,

       then ALL THOSE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, LAWMEN AND JUDICIARY ASSOCIATED
       WITH THE CASE ARE BREAKING THE LAW AND THEREFORE OFFERING THEMSELVES
       UP TO LEGAL ACTION DIRECTED TOWARDS THEM ON THE PART OF THE ACCUSED!

       The case is  also automatically invalidated  and  THEREFORE  ILLEGAL
       even if the  policemen,  court  officers, judges or  other  involved
       public servants CONTINUE      TO      PURSUE      legal      action.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Note that the  following  is  not   a   DIRECT   TRANSCRIPT  of  the
       conversation because I don't remember all the details but here goes.

       Mr. Hallmark said  that  in  the 14th or 15th century,  one  of  the
       English Kings had  a  falling  out  with a group of people.  He then
       made a law that would directly affect  these  people and put it into
       motion.  The group were brought to court using that  new  law as the
       basis of the case.  The jurors listened to the law and the arguments

                                      Part 5





       of the group,  eventually  deciding  that the law was unfair, unjust
       and illegal.

       The King was outraged and placed  the  jurors  in  prison until they
       decided to carry  out a sentence based on his new  law  which  would
       result in the  imprisonment  of  the  targeted group of people.  The
       jurors refused to comply and as  time  went  on,  the  public outcry
       became so great,  the  King  was forced to release  the  jurors  and
       rescind his new law to prevent open rebellion.

       Similar cases have  since  arisen  in  various countries and in each
       case, the jurors decided that a law  was unjust and it automatically
       became invalid.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Quoting Mr. Hallmarks letter again :

       Use of the 9th and 10th Amendments to the Constitution,  as  well as
       the State Constitutions should be used as a defense,

            INSTEAD OF  TRYING  TO  DEFEND ONE'S SELF AGAINST THE CHARGE OF
            PRACTICING MEDICINE WITHOUT A LICENSE,

       simply say

            the government has NEVER BEEN GIVEN THE POWER
            TO LICENSE ANYTHING!

       For the federal government to license would require a constitutional
       convention, and a  proposed  amendment   submitted   to  each  state
       legislature, and two-thirds of the state legislatures  would have to
       OK the measure.

       For the states themselves to license, if such a provision was not
       written in the original state constitution, a measure would have to
       be presented to the state's people, and a state-wide referendum
       taken to the people for a vote.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       So, I suggest  you  study  the  Constitution  and Amendments of your
       State as well as those of the United  States to determine the degree
       of control your particular environment has on your actions.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       One more thing that bothers me intensely.  Why does  everyone  refer
       to the United States and its government as a Democracy?  When it was
       clearly in the Constitution to be a REPUBLIC?

       The dictionary definitions  are quite distinct and specific for each
       form of government :

          republic  -   a   state   with    sovereign   power   vested   in
                      representatives of  the people, chosen  by  them  and
                      responsible to them

          democracy - ruled by the people

       In effect, democracy  can be interpreted as MOB RULE without benefit
       of the representatives specifically ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE.

       People need to get out of the habit of referring to the United


                                      Page 6





       States as "DEMOCRATIC"  unless  we actually take steps to change our
       system of government.  It is a decided error and quite incorrect.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Another thing that confirms the existence  of  the  United States as
       being a REPUBLIC - the Pledge of Allegiance specifically states:

           I pledge  allegiance  to  the  flag,  of  the United  States  of
           America, and  TO  THE  REPUBLIC  for which it stands, one nation
           under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.

       As final proof that the United States  is in fact a REPUBLIC and NOT
       a DEMOCRACY, read the following.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                ARTICLE IV    RELATION OF THE STATES TO EACH OTHER

       Section 4.    The United States shall guarantee to  every  State  in
                     this Union

                            a Republican Form of Government,

                     and shall  protect  each of them against Invasion; and
                     on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive
                     (when the  Legislature  cannot  be  convened)  against
                     domestic Violence.

       That's about the extent of this little diatribe but I found it quite
       interesting to look  up the details and wish to thank  Mr.  Hallmark
       for his letter  to  the  American  Dowsing Society and our follow up
       phone calls.

       Admittedly, there are  bound  to   be   some  errors  in  the  above
       interpretations and I would be most pleased to entertain a brief and
       concise description of  what  they  might be and  what  is  IN  FACT
       correct.

       At this time,  I  find  no  error in the basic premise regarding the
       practice of medicine without a license  as  authorized by the United
       States Constitution by specific OMISSION.

       Again, this does  not  apply  to ALL States as each  can  alter  its
       Constitution to encompass whatever the people will tolerate.

       An excellent opportunity  presents itself here.  It would entail the
       collection of all such Constitutional  Article  Violations and their
       case histories as well as how they could BE SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED for
       defense against such charges.  This would also include  a collection
       of precedents in  history and as overturned by various Juries around
       the country (assuming this aspect  is correct).  Think what it would
       mean to offer  a  book  with  detailed  legal  information  on  this
       subject.  Fame, fortune    and    a    grateful    public    AWAITS!
