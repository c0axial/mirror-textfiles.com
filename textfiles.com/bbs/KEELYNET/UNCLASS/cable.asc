         If you have cable TV but are not fortunate enough to have the
     premium services, here is a simple way to pickup Cinemax, the Movie
     Channel, Showtime, the Disney Channel, and any other service that
     appears as a fuzzy picture (one that you can almost get clearly by
     fine tuning).

         This method also works on channels that appear as a lined
     flashing screen that produces a beeping sound.  These channels are
     not truly scrambled, which entails a random sync pulse or a coded
     signal, but instead a garbage transmission is sent at the same
     frequency.  Therefore, in order to receive the movie services
     clearly, you must filter out the garbage.

    Here is a simple way to do this:

    1)   Examine the back of your TV set. Find the VHF antenna
         terminals (these are the antenna terminals that the cable
         service is hooked up to).  Get a piece of antenna wire
         about 3 feet long. Strip one end of the wire and attach it
         to the VHF terminals along with the cable.

    2)   Tune in to one of the movie services and adjust the fine
         tuner until you get the cleanest picture.

    3)   Cut off about 1/4 inch of the antenna wire and adjust the
         fine tuner.  Continue to do this until you get a nearly
         perfect picture (NOTE: You shouldn't have to cut off more
         than 6 inches of the antenna wire).

    4)   Get a piece of aluminum foil and wrap it around the antenna
         wire.  Slide it up and down until you have a perfect
         picture.

   It sounds complicated, but it's actually very simple and effective.
