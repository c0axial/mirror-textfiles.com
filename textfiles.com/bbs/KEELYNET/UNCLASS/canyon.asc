       The following is   an  intriguing  article  entitled  "Archeological
       Coverups", by David Hatcher Childress  in  the above NEXUS magazine.
       Following that is  a  newspaper  article  from  a   1909   newspaper
       indicating a bizarre suppressed find in the Grand Canyon area.

       It indicates either  a  hoax  published  at  the  time  OR  that the
       Smithsonian and/or the government  is  covering  up  details of past
       archeological discoveries that  would rock current understanding  of
       the past.

       Despite KeelyNet being primarily a science based board, this article
       intrigues us because of the similarity in information suppression to
       "protect the people"....this  would  appear  to be the reason WHY we
       don't have working free energy and  anti-grav  devices  as  well  as
       absolute cures for most terminal diseases.

       If, after reading the article and the attached newspaper  file,  you
       decide to investigate  the matter further, we here at KeelyNet would
       appreciate you sharing your findings with either/or Mr. Childress at
       the World Explorers Club or us here at KeelyNet.  Thanks...>>> Jerry

       Most of us are familiar with the last  scene  in the popular Indiana
       Jones archeological adventure film RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK in which

                                      Page 1





       an important historical  artefact,  the Ark of the Covenant from the
       Temple in Jerusalem, is locked  in  a  crate  and  put  in  a  giant
       warehouse, never to  be seen again, thus ensuring  that  no  history
       books will have  to  be rewritten and no history professor will have
       to revise the lecture that he has  been  giving  for  the last forty
       years.

       While the film was fiction, the scene in which an important  ancient
       relic is buried in a warehouse is uncomfortably close to reality for
       many researchers.  To   those   who   investigate   allegations   of
       archaeological cover-ups, there are  disturbing indications that the
       most important archaeological  institute in the United  States,  the
       Smithsonian Institute, an   independent  federal  agency,  has  been
       actively suppressing some  of the  most  interesting  and  important
       archaeological discoveries made in the Americas.

       The Vatican has been long accused of keeping artefacts  and  ancient
       books in their  vast  cellars,  without  allowing  the outside world
       access to them.  These secret treasures,  often  of  a controversial
       historical or religious  nature,  are  allegedly suppressed  by  the
       Catholic Church because  they might damage the church's credibility,
       or perhaps cast their official texts  in  doubt.   Sadly,  there  is
       overwhelming evidence that something very similar is  happening with
       the Smithsonian Institution.

       The cover-up and  alleged  suppression  of  archaeological  evidence
       began in late 1881 when John Wesley Powell, the geologist famous for
       exploring the Grand Canyon, appointed  Cyrus  Thomas as the director
       of the Eastern  Mound  Division  of  the  Smithsonian  Institution's
       Bureau of Ethnology.

       When Thomas came to the Bureau of Ethnology he was a

        "pronounced believer  in the existence of a race of Mound Builders,
                       distinct from the American Indians."

       However, John Wesley  Powell,  the   director   of   the  Bureau  of
       Ethnology, a very sympathetic man toward the American  Indians,  had
       lived with the  peaceful  Winnebago  Indians  of  Wisconsin for many
       years as a  youth  and  felt that  American  Indians  were  unfairly
       thought of as primitive and savage.

       The Smithsonian began to promote the idea that Native  Americans, at
       that time being exterminated in the Indian Wars, were descended from
       advanced civilisations and were worthy of respect and protection.

       They also began a program of suppressing any archaeological evidence
       that lent credence to the school of thought known as Diffusionism, a
       school which believes   that   throughout  history  there  has  been
       widespread dispersion of culture  and  civilisation  via  contact by
       ship and major trade routes.

       The Smithsonian opted   for   the   opposite   school,    known   as
       Isolationism.  Isolationism holds   that   most   civilisations  are
       isolated from each other and that there has been very little contact
       between them, especially  those that  are  separated  by  bodies  of
       water.  In this intellectual war that started in the  1880s,  it was
       held that even  contact  between  the  civilisations of the Ohio and
       Mississippi Valleys were rare, and certainly these civilisations did

                                      Page 2





       not have any  contact  with  such  advanced  cultures  as the Mayas,
       Toltecs, or Aztecs in Mexico and  Central  America.   By  Old  World
       standards this is an extreme, and even ridiculous idea,  considering
       that the river  system  reached  to  the  Gulf  of  Mexico and these
       civilisations were as close as the  opposite  shore of the gulf.  It
       was like saying that cultures in the Black Sea area  could  not have
       had contact with the Mediterranean.

       When the contents of many ancient mounds and pyramids of the Midwest
       were examined, it  was  shown  that  the  history of the Mississippi
       River Valleys was that of an ancient  and sophisticated culture that
       had been in contact with Europe and other areas.  Not only that, the
       contents of many  mounds  revealed  burials of huge  men,  sometimes
       seven or eight  feet  tall, in full armour with swords and sometimes
       huge treasures.

       (Vangard note..>Eastern Indian texts  say that at one time men lived
       thousands of years and grew very tall in direct proportion  to their
       age, as does  the  Bible  with the comment "and there were GIANTS in
       the earth in those days...")

       For instance, when Spiro Mound in  Oklahoma  was  excavated  in  the
       1930's, a tall man in full armour was discovered along with a pot of
       thousands of pearls and other artefacts, the largest  such  treasure
       so far documented.   The whereabouts of the man in armour is unknown
       and it is  quite  likely  that  it   eventually  was  taken  to  the
       Smithsonian Institution.

       In a private  conversation  with a well-known historical  researcher
       (who shall remain  nameless),  I  was told that a former employee of
       the Smithsonian, who  was  dismissed   for  defending  the  view  of
       diffusionism in the  Americas  (i.e. the heresy that  other  ancient
       civilisations may have visited the shores of North and South America
       during the many   millenia   before   Columbus),  alleged  that  the
       Smithsonian at one time had actually  taken  a barge full of unusual
       artefacts out into the Atlantic and dumped them in the ocean.

       Though the idea  of  the  Smithsonian'  covering   up   a   valuable
       archaeological find is  difficult  to  accept  for  some,  there is,
       sadly, a great deal of evidence  to  suggest  that  the  Smithsonian
       Institution has knowingly   covered   up   and   'lost'    important
       archaeological relics.  The  STONEWATCH  NEWSLETTER of the Gungywamp
       Society in Connecticut, which researches  megalithic  sites  in  New
       England, had a curious story in their Winter 1992 issue  about stone
       coffins discovered in  1892  in  Alabama  which  were  sent  to  the
       Smithsonian Institution and   then   'lost'.    According   to   the
       newsletter, researcher Frederick J. Pohl wrote an intriguing  letter
       in 1950 to the late Dr. T.C. Lethbridge, a British archaeologist.

       The letter from  Pohl  stated,  "A  professor  of  geology sent me a
       reprint (of the) Smithsonian Institution,  THE  CRUMF BURIAL CAVE by
       Frank Burns, US  Geological  Survey,  from  the  report  of  the  US
       National Museum for  1892,  pp  451-454,  1984.   In the Crumf Cave,
       southern branch of the Warrior River,  in  Murphy's  Valley,  Blount
       County, Alabama, accessible from Mobile Bay by river,  were  coffins
       of wood hollowed  out  by  fire,  aided  by stone or copper chisels.
       Either of these coffins were taken  to  the  Smithsonian.  They were
       about 7.5 feet long, 14" to 18" wide, 6" to 7" deep.  Lids open.

       "I wrote recently  to  the  Smithsonian,  and received a reply March
       11th from F.M. Setzler, Head Curator  of  Department of Anthropology
       (He said) 'We  have  not  been  able  to find the specimens  in  our
       collections, though records show that they were received."

       David Barron, President of the Gungywamp Society was eventually told
       by the Smithsonian  in  1992  that  the coffins were actually wooden
       troughs and that they could not be  viewed  anyway because they were
       housed in an asbestos-contaminated warehouse.  This warehouse was to
       be closed for  the next ten years and no one was allowed  in  except
       the Smithsonian personnel!

       Ivan T. Sanderson,  a  well-known  zoologist  and  frequent guest on
       Johnny Carson's TONIGHT SHOW in the  1960s  (usually  with an exotic
       animal with a  pangolin or a lemur), once related  a  curious  story
       about a letter  he  received regarding an engineer who was stationed
       on the Aleutian  island  of  Shemya  during  World  War  II.   While
       building an airstrip,  his  crew  bulldozed  a group  of  hills  and
       discovered under several  sedimentary  layers  what  appeared  to be
       human remains.  The  Alaskan  mound  was  in  fact  a  graveyard  of
       gigantic human remains, consisting of crania and long leg bones.

       The crania measured from 22 to 24 inches from base  to crown.  Since
       an adult skull  normally  measures  about  eight inches from back to
       front, such a  large  crania would  imply  an  immense  size  for  a
       normally proportioned human.  Furthermore, every skull  was  said to
       have been neatly trepanned (a process of cutting a hole in the upper
       portion of the skull).

       In fact, the  habit of flattening the skull of an infant and forcing
       it to grow in an elongated shape  was  a  practice  used  by ancient
       Peruvians, the Mayas, and the Flathead Indians of Montana. Sanderson
       tried to gather further proof, eventually receiving  a  letter  from
       another member of  the  unit  who confirmed the report.  The letters
       both indicated that the Smithsonian  Institution  had  collected the
       remains, yet nothing  else  was  heard.  Sanderson seemed  convinced
       that the Smithsonian  Institution  had  received the bizarre relics,
       but wondered why they would not release  the  data.  He asks, "...is
       it that these people cannot face rewriting all the textbooks?"

       In 1944 an accidental discovery of an even more controversial nature
       was made by Waldemar Julsrud at Acambaro, Mexico.   Acambaro  is  in
       the state of  Guanajuato,  175  miles northwest of Mexico City.  The
       strange archaeological site there  yielded  over  33,500  objects of
       ceramic;stone, including jade; and knives of obsidian  (sharper than
       steel and still  used today in heart surgery).  Jalsrud, a prominent
       local German merchant, also found  statues ranging from less than an
       inch to six feet in length depicting great reptiles, some of them in
       ACTIVE ASSOCIATION with humans - generally eating them,  but in some
       bizarre statuettes an   erotic   association   was   indicated.   To
       observers many of these creatures resembled dinosaurs.

       Jalsrud crammed this collection into  twelve  rooms  of his expanded
       house.  There startling representations of Negroes,  Orientals,  and
       bearded Caucasians were   included  as  were  motifs  of  Egyptians,
       Sumerian and other ancient non-hemispheric civilisations, as well as
       portrayals of Bigfoot  and  aquatic   monsterlike  creatures,  weird
       human-animal mixtures, and  a host of other inexplicable  creations.
       Teeth from an extinct Ice Age horse, the skeleton of a mammoth, and

                                      Page 4





       a number of  human skulls were found at the same site as the ceramic
       artefacts.

       Radio-carbon dating in  the  laboratories   of   the  University  of
       Pennsylvania and   additional  tests  using  the  thermoluminescence
       method of dating  pottery were performed to determine the age of the
       objects.  Results indicated the objects  were made about 6,500 years
       ago, around 4,500  BC.   A  team  of experts at another  university,
       shown Jalrud's half-dozen samples but unaware of their origin, ruled
       out the possibility  that they could have been modern reproductions.
       However, they fell silent when told of their controversial source.

       In 1952, in an effort to debunk  this  weird  collection  which  was
       gaining a certain amount of fame, American archaeologist  Charles C.
       DiPeso claimed to  have  minutely  examined  the  then 32,000 pieces
       within not more than four hours spent  at the home of Julsrud.  In a
       forthcoming book, long  delayed  by continuing developments  in  his
       investigation, archaeological investigator  John H. Tierney, who has
       lectured on the case for decades,  points out that to have done that
       DiPeso would have  had  to  have  inspected  133 pieces  per  minute
       steadily for four   hours,  whereas  in  actuality,  it  would  have
       required weeks merely  to  have  separated  the  massive  jumble  of
       exhibits and arranged them properly for a valid evaluation.

       Tierney, who collaborated with the later Professor Hapgood, the late
       William N. Russell,  and others in the investigation,  charges  that
       the Smithsonian Institution  and  other  archaeological  authorities
       conducted a campaign of disinformation against the discoveries.  The
       Smithsonian had, early  in  the controversy,  dismissed  the  entire
       Acambaro collection as  an  elaborate  hoax.   Also,  utilising  the
       Freedom of Information  Act, Tierney discovered that practically the
       entirety of the Smithsonian's Julsrud case files are missing.

       After two expeditions  to  the site  in  1955  and  1968,  Professor
       Charles Hapgood, a  professor  of  history and anthropology  at  the
       University of New  Hampshire,  recorded  the  results of his 18-year
       investigation of Acambaro  in  a  privately  printed  book  entitled
       MYSTERY IN ACAMBARO.   Hapgood was initially an open-minded  skeptic
       concerning the collection  but  became  a  believer  after his first
       visit in 1955, at which time he witnessed  some of the figures being
       excavated and even dictated to the diggers where he  wanted  them to
       dig.

       Adding to the  mind-boggling aspects of this controversy is the fact
       that the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia  e Historia, through the
       late Director of PreHispanic Monuments, Dr. Eduardo  Noguera,  (who,
       as head of  an  official  investigating  team  at the site, issued a
       report which Tierney  will be publishing),  admitted  "the  apparent
       scientific legality with  which these objects wer  found."   Despite
       evidence of their own eyes, however, officials declared that because
       of the objects  'fantastic'  nature,  they  had  to have been a hoax
       played on Julsrud!

       A disappointed but ever-hopeful Julsrud  died.   His  house was sold
       and the collection put in storage.  The collection  is not currently
       open to the public.

       Perhaps the most  amazing suppression of all is the excavation of an
       Egyptian tomb by the Smithsonian itself in Arizona.  A lengthy front

                                      Page 5





       page story of  the  PHOENIX  GAZETTE  on  5 April 1909 (follows this
       article), gave a  highly  detailed   report  of  the  discovery  and
       excavation of a rock-cut vault by an expedition led  by  a Professor
       S.A. Jordan of the Smithsonian.  The Smithsonian, however, claims to
       have absolutely no knowledge of the discovery or its discoverers.

       The World Explorers  Club  decided to check on this story by calling
       the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C., though we felt there was little
       chance of getting any real information.   After  speaking briefly to
       an operator, we   were   transferred   to   a   Smithsonian    staff
       archaeologist, and a  woman's voice came on the phone and identified
       herself.

       I told her that I was investigating  a  story  from  a  1909 Phoenix
       newspaper article about   the   Smithsonian   Institution's   having
       excavated rock-cut vaults   in   the  Grand  Canyon  where  Egyptian
       artefacts had been   discovered,   and   whether   the   Smithsonian
       Institution could give me any more information on the subject.

       "Well, the first thing I can tell you, before we  go  any  further,"
       she said, "is  that no Egyptian artefacts of any kind have ever been
       found in North or South America.  Therefore, I can tell you that the
       Smithsonian Institute has  never   been   involved   in   any   such
       excavations."  She was  quite helpful and polite but,  in  the  end,
       knew nothing.  Neither  she  nor anyone else with whom I spoke could
       find any record  of  the  discovery   or  either  G.E.  Kinkaid  and
       Professor S.A. Jordan.

       While it cannot be discounted that the entire story  is an elaborate
       newspaper hoax, the  fact  that  it was on the front page, named the
       prestigious Smithsonian Institution,  and  gave  a  highly  detailed
       story that went  on  for several pages, lends a great  deal  to  its
       credibility.  It is hard to believe such a story could have come out
       of thin air.

       Is the Smithsonian   Institution   covering   up  an  archaeological
       discovery of immense importance?   If  this  story  is true it would
       radically change the  current  view that there was  no  transoceanic
       contact in pre-Columbian  times,  and  that all American Indians, on
       both continents, are  descended from  Ice  Age  explorers  who  came
       across the Bering  Strait.   (Any  information on G.E.  Kinkaid  and
       Professor S.A. Jordan,  or  their  alleged discoveries, that readers
       may have would be greatly appreciated.....write  to Childress at the
       World Explorers Club at the above address.)

       Is the idea that ancient Egyptians came to the Arizona  area  in the
       ancient past so  objectionable  and  preposterous  that  it  must be
       covered up?  Perhaps the Smithsonian  Institution is more interested
       in maintaining the status quo than rocking the boat with astonishing
       new discoveries that    overturn   previously   accepted    academic
       teachings.

       Historian and linguist  Carl  Hart,  editor  of WORLD EXPLORER, then
       obtained a hiker's  map of the Grand  Canyon  from  a  bookstore  in
       Chicago.  Poring over the map, we were amazed to  see  that  much of
       the area on  the  north  side of the canyon has Egyptian names.  The
       area around Ninety-four Mile Creek and Trinity Creek had areas (rock
       formations, apparently) with names  like  Tower of Set, Tower of Ra,
       Horus Temple, Osiris Temple, and Isis Temple.  In the Haunted Canyon

                                      Page 6





       area were such  names  as  the  Cheops Pyramid, the Buddha Cloister,
       Buddha Temple, Manu  Temple  and   Shiva   Temple.   Was  there  any
       relationship between these   places   and   the   alleged   Egyptian
       discoveries in the Grand Canyon?

       We called a  state  archaeologist at the Grand Canyon, and were told
       that the early explorers had just  liked  Egyptian  and Hindu names,
       but that it  was  true that this area was off limits  to  hikers  or
       other visitors, "because of dangerous caves."

       Indeed, this entire  area with the Egyptian and Hindu place names in
       the Grand Canyon is a forbidden zone  -  no one is allowed into this
       large area.

       We could only conclude that this was the area where  the vaults were
       located.  Yet today, this area is curiously off-limits to all hikers
       and even, in large part, park personnel.

       I believe that  the  discerning reader will see that if only a small
       part of the  "Smithsoniangate"  evidence  is  true,  then  our  most
       hallowed archaeological institution  has been actively  involved  in
       suppressing evidence for  advanced  American  cultures, evidence for
       ancient voyages of various cultures  to  North America, evidence for
       anomalistic giants and  other oddball artefacts, and  evidence  that
       tends to disprove  the  official  dogma  that  is now the history of
       North America.

       The Smithsonian's Board  of  Regents   still  refuses  to  open  its
       meetings to the  news media or the public.  If Americans  were  ever
       allowed inside the  'nation's  attic',  as  the Smithsonian has been
       called, what skeletons might they find?

                           EXPLORATIONS IN GRAND CANYON
              Mysteries of Immense Rich Cavern being brought to light
                                Jordan is enthused
           Remarkable finds indicate ancient people migrated from Orient

       The latest news of the progress of  the  explorations of what is now
       regarded by scientists   as   not  only  the  oldest   archeological
       discovery in the  United States, but one of the most valuable in the
       world, which was mentioned some time ago in the Gazette, was brought
       to the city yesterday by G.E. Kinkaid,  the  explorer  who found the
       great underground citadel  of the Grand Canyon during  a  trip  from
       Green River, Wyoming,  down the Colorado, in a wooden boat, to Yuma,
       several months ago.

       According to the story related to  the  Gazette  by Mr. Kinkaid, the
       archaelogists of the Smithsonian Institute, which is  financing  the
       expeditions, have made  discoveries  which almost conclusively prove
       that the race which inhabited this  mysterious cavern, hewn in solid
       rock by human  hands, was of oriental origin, possibly  from  Egypt,
       tracing back to  Ramses.   If  their  theories  are borne out by the
       translation of the tablets engraved  with heiroglyphics, the mystery
       of the prehistoric peoples of North America, their ancient arts, who
       they were and whence they came, will be solved.  Egypt and the Nile,
       and Arizona and the Colorado will be linked by a historical chain

                                      Page 7





       running back to  ages  which  staggers  the  wildest  fancy  of  the
       fictionist.

                              A Thorough Examination

       Under the direction of Prof. S. A. Jordan, the Smithsonian Institute
       is now prosecuting the most thorough  explorations,  which  will  be
       continued until the last link in the chain is forged.  Nearly a mile
       underground, about 1480  feet  below  the  surface,  the  long  main
       passage has been  delved  into, to find another mammoth chamber from
       which radiates scores of passageways, like the spokes of a wheel.

       Several hundred rooms have been discovered,  reached  by passageways
       running from the main passage, one of them having been  explored for
       854 feet and  another  634  feet.  The recent finds include articles
       which have never been known as native to this country, and doubtless
       they had their  origin  in  the   orient.    War   weapons,   copper
       instruments, sharp-edged and hard as steel, indicate  the high state
       of civilization reached by these strange people.  So interested have
       the scientists become  that preparations are being made to equip the
       camp for extensive studies, and  the  force  will  be  increased  to
       thirty or forty persons.

                               Mr. Kinkaid's Report

       Mr. Kinkaid was the first white child born in Idaho  and has been an
       explorer and hunter  all  his  life, thirty years having been in the
       service of the Smithsonian Institute.   Even  briefly recounted, his
       history sounds fabulous, almost grotesque.

       "First, I would impress that the cavern is nearly inaccessible.  The
       entrance is 1,486 feet down the sheer canyon wall.  It is located on
       government land and no visitor will be allowed there  under  penalty
       of trespass.  The  scientists  wish to work unmolested, without fear
       of archeological discoveries  being  disturbed  by  curio  or  relic
       hunters.

       A trip there would be fruitless, and the visitor  would  be  sent on
       his way.  The  story of how I found the cavern has been related, but
       in a paragraph: I was journeying down  the Colorado river in a boat,
       alone, looking for mineral.  Some forty-two miles up  the river from
       the El Tovar  Crystal  canyon, I saw on the east wall, stains in the
       sedimentary formation about 2,000  feet  above the river bed.  There
       was no trail  to  this point, but I finally reached  it  with  great
       difficulty.

       Above a shelf  which  hid it from view from the river, was the mouth
       of the cave.  There are steps leading from this entrance some thirty
       yards to what was, at the time the  cavern  was inhabited, the level
       of the river.  When I saw the chisel marks on the  wall  inside  the
       entrance, I became  interested, securing my gun and went in.  During
       that trip I went back several hundred  feet  along  the main passage
       till I came to the crypt in which I discovered the  mummies.  One of
       these I stood  up  and  photographed  by  flashlight.   I gathered a
       number of relics, which I carried  down  the  Colorado to Yuma, from
       whence I shipped them to Washington with details of  the  discovery.
       Following this, the explorations were undertaken.

                                   The Passages

       "The main passageway  is  about 12 feet wide, narrowing to nine feet
       toward the farther end.  About 57  feet from the entrance, the first
       side-passages branch off to the right and left, along which, on both
       sides, are a number of rooms about the size of ordinary living rooms
       of today, though some are 30 by 40 feet square.  These  are  entered
       by oval-shaped doors  and are ventilated by round air spaces through
       the walls into the passages.  The  walls  are  about  three feet six
       inches in thickness.

       The passages are chiseled or hewn as straight as could  be  laid out
       by an engineer.   The  ceilings  of  many of the rooms converge to a
       center.  The side-passages near the  entrance  run  at a sharp angle
       from the main hall, but toward the rear they gradually reach a right
       angle in direction.

                                    The Shrine

       "Over a hundred  feet  from the entrance is the cross-hall,  several
       hundred feet long,  in  which  are  found the idol, or image, of the
       people's god, sitting cross-legged,  with  a lotus flower or lily in
       each hand.  The cast of the face is oriental, and the  carving  this
       cavern.  The idol almost resembles Buddha, though the scientists are
       not certain as to what religious worship it represents.  Taking into
       consideration everything found  thus  far,  it is possible that this
       worship most resembles the ancient people of Tibet.

       Surrounding this idol are smaller  images,  some  very  beautiful in
       form; others crooked-necked   and   distorted  shapes,   symbolical,
       probably, of good  and  evil.   There  are  two  large  cactus  with
       protruding arms, one on each side  of  the  dais  on  which  the god
       squats.  All this is carved out of hard rock resembling  marble.  In
       the opposite corner  of  this  cross-hall  were  found  tools of all
       descriptions, made of copper.  These  people  undoubtedly  knew  the
       lost art of hardening this metal, which has been sought by chemicals
       for centureis without  result.   On  a  bench  running   around  the
       workroom was some  charcoal  and other material probably used in the
       process.  There is also slag and  stuff  similar  to  matte, showing
       that these ancients smelted ores, but so far no trace  of  where  or
       how this was done has been discovered, nor the origin of the ore.

       "Among the other  finds  are  vases  or  urns and cups of copper and
       gold, made very  artistic  in design.   The  pottery  work  includes
       enameled ware and  glazed  vessels.   Another  passageway  leads  to
       granaries such as  are  found in the oriental temples.  They contain
       seeds of varous kinds.  One very large  storehouse  has not yet been
       entered, as it  is  twelve  feet high and can be reached  only  from
       above.  Two copper  hooks  extend  on the edge, which indicates that
       some sort of ladder was attached.   These  granaries are rounded, as
       the materials of which they are constructed, I think,  is a ver hard
       cement.  A gray  metal  is  also found in this cavern, which puzzles
       the scientists, for  its identity  has  not  been  established.   It
       resembles platinum.  Strewn promiscuously over the  floor everywhere
       are what people  call "cats eyse', a yellow stone of no great value.
       Each one is engraved with the head of the Malay type.

                                 The Hieroglyphics

       "On all the  urns,  or  walls  over  doorways , and tablets of stone
       which were found by the image are  the mysterious hieroglyphics, the
       key to which the Smithsonian Institute hopes yet to  discover.   The
       engraving on the  tables  probably  has  something  to  do  with the
       religion of the people.  Similar  hieroglyphics  have  been found in
       southern Arizona.  Among the pictorial writings,  only  two  animals
       are found.  One is of prehistoric type.

                                     The Crypt

       "The tomb or  crypt  in  which  the mummies were found is one of the
       largest of the chambers, the walls  slanting  back  at  an  angle of
       about 35 degrees.  On these are tiers of mummies, each one occupying
       a separate hewn  shelf.  At the head of each is a  small  bench,  on
       which is found copper cups and pieces of broken swords.  Some of the
       mummies are covered with clay, and all are wrapped in a bark fabric.

       The urns or  cups  on the lower tiers are crude, while as the higher
       shelves are reached, the urns are  finer  in design, showing a later
       stage of civilization.  It is worthy of note that  all  the  mummies
       examined so far have proved to be male, no children or females being
       buried here.  This  leads  to  the belief that this exterior section
       was the warriors' barracks.

       "Among the discoveries no bones  of  animals  have  been  found,  no
       skins, no clothing, no bedding.  Many of the rooms  are bare but for
       water vessels.  One  room,  about  40  by 700 feet, was probably the
       main dining hall, for cooking utensils  are  found here.  What these
       people lived on is a problem, though it is presumed  that  they came
       south in the  winter  and farmed in the valleys, going back north in
       the summer.

       Upwards of 50,000  people  could   have   lived   in   the   caverns
       comfortably.  One theory is that the present Indian  tribes found in
       Arizona are descendants  of  the serfs or slaves of the people which
       inhabited the cave.  Undoubtedly  a  good  many  thousands  of years
       before the Christian era, a people lived here which  reached  a high
       stage of civilization.   The  chronology of human history is full of
       gaps.  Professor Jordan is much enthused  over  the  discoveries and
       believes that the   find  will  prove  of  incalculable   value   in
       archeological work.

       "One thing I  have  not spoken of, may be of interest.  There is one
       chamber of the passageway to which  is  not  ventilated, and when we
       approached it a deadly, snaky smell struck us.  Our  light would not
       penetrate the gloom,  and  until stronger ones are available we will
       not know what the chamber contains.   Some  say  snakes,  but  other
       boo-hoo this idea and think it may contain a deadly gas or chemicals
       used by the ancients.  No sounds are heard, but it smells snaky just
       the same.  The  whole underground installation gives  one  of  shaky
       nerves the creeps.   The  gloom is like a weight on one's shoulders,
       and our flashlights and candles  only  make  the  darkness  blacker.
       Imagination can revel  in  conjectures  and ungodly  daydreams  back
       through the ages  that  have  elapsed till the mind reels dizzily in
       space."

                                 An Indian Legend

       In connection with  this  story,  it  is notable that among the Hopi
       Indians the tradition is told that  their ancestors once lived in an
       underworld in the  Grand  Canyon till dissension arose  between  the
       good and the  bad,  the  people  of  one heart and the people of two
       hearts.  Machetto, who was their chief,  counseled them to leave the
       underworld, but there was no way out.  The chief then  caused a tree
       to grow up  and  pierce  the  roof  of  the underworld, and then the
       people of one heart climbed out.   They  tarried  by  Paisisvai (Red
       River), which is the Colorado, and grew grain and corn.

       They sent out  a  message  to  the  Temple  of the Sun,  asking  the
       blessing of peace, good will and rain for people of one heart.  That
       messenger never returned,  but today at the Hopi villages at sundown
       can be seen the old men of the tribe  out  on  the  housetops gazing
       toward the sun, looking for the messenger.  When he  returns,  their
       lands and ancient  dwelling place will be restored to them.  That is
       the tradition.

       Among the engravings of animals in  the  cave is seen the image of a
       heart over the spot where it is located.  The legend  was learned by
       W.E. Rollins, the artist, during a year spent with the Hopi Indians.

       There are two  theories of the origin of the Egyptians.  One is that
       they came from Asia; another that the racial cradle was in the upper
       Nile region.  Heeren, an Egyptologist, believed in the Indian origin
       of the Egyptians.  The discoveries  in  the  Grand  Canyon may throw
       further light on human evolution and prehistoric ages.
