USSR     05/19/71   Mars 2     11/27/71  Orbiter and Lander.  Landing
                                         capsule separated from spacecraft
                                         and made first, unsuccessful
                                         attempt to softland.  Orbiter
                                         continued to transmit data.

USSR     05/28/71   Mars 3     12/02/71  Orbiter and Lander.  Landing
                                         capsule seperated from spacecraft
                                         and landed in southern hemisphere.
                                         Onboard camera transmitted for only
                                         20 seconds.  Orbiter transmitted
                                         for 3 months.

US       05/30/71   Mariner 9  11/13/71  Mars orbiter.  First interplanetary
                                         probe to orbit another planet.
                                         During nearly a year of operations,
                                         obtained detailed photographs of the
                                         Martian moons, Phobos and Deimos,
                                         and mapped 100 percent of the Martian
                                         surface.

USSR     07/21/73   Mars 4 &   02/10/74  Orbiters and Landers.  Mars 4

USSR     07/25/73   Mars 5     02/12/74  retro rockets failed to fire,
                                         preventing orbit insertion.  As
                                         it passed the planet, Mars 4
                                         returned one swath of pictures and
                                         some radio occultation data.  Mars
                                         5 was successfully placed in orbit,
                                         but operated only a few days,
                                         returning photographs of a small
                                         portion of southern hemisphere of
                                         Mars.

USSR     08/05/73   Mars 6 &   03/12/74  Orbiters and Landers.  Mars 6

USSR     08/09/73   Mars 7     03/09/74  lander module transmitted data
                                         during descent, but transmissions
                                         abruptly ceased when the landing
                                         rockets were fired.  Mars 7 descent
                                         module was seperated from the main
                                         spacecraft due to a problem in the
                                         operation of one of the onboard
                                         sub-systems, and passed by the
                                         planet.

US       08/20/75   Viking 1   06/19/76  Mars orbiter and lander.  First

                               07/20/76  craft on another planet.  Landed
                               Landed    on the Plain of Chryse.  Both
                                         orbiters (Viking 1 & 2) took a
                                         total of 52,000 images during
                                         their mission; approximately 97
                                         percent of the surface was
                                         imaged.  Viking 1 orbiter continued
                                         to operate until 08/07/80; Viking
                                         lander operated until 11/13/82.

                               Landed    end of the Martian winter.  The two
                                         landers (Viking 1 & 2) took 4,500
                                         images of the surface and provided
                                         over 3 million weather reports.
                                         Viking 2 orbiter continued to
                                         operate until 07/25/78; Viking 2
                                         lander operated until 11/13/82.

USSR     07/07/88   Phobos 1 & 01/89     International project to study

USSR     07/12/88   Phobos 2   01/89     Mars and its moon phobos.  Phobos
                                         1 was disabled by a ground control
                                         error.  Phobos 2 was successfully
                                         inserted into Martian orbit in
                                         January 1989 to study the Martian
                                         surface, atmosphere and magnetic
                                         field.  On March 27, 1989,
                                         communications with Phobos 2 were
                                         lost and efforts to contact the
                                         spacecraft were unsuccessful.

US       09/25/92   Mars          ..     Mars Orbiter; Spacecraft took 1
                    Observer             photo of Mars approx 20 days
                                         prior to MOI (Mars orbital
                                         insertion).  Communications were
                                         lost at 6:00 p.m. 08/21/93, 3 days
                                         prior to MOI.  As of 08/28/93
                                         no reason can be found for the
                                         loss of contact.  Visions of
