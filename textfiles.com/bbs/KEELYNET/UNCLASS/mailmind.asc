  MAILMIND.ASC

  Recently, advertisements appeared in the Dallas Morning News for a "free" 3
  1/2 hour workshop  &  career  orientation to learn about POSTAL JOBS in the
  Dallas area.  The "free" seminar actually cost $20, to cover the "materials
  and registration fee".

  The following statements are my opinions  regarding  my  experience at that
  seminar.  Because I had just finished reading the excellent MIND2.ASC file,
  I was able to recognize the direction that the seminar  was  taking, as the
  "charismatic" leader turned a group of 100 adults into "true believers".

  I STRONGLY encourage  the  reading  of the MIND2.ASC file, by anyone who is
  considering attending ANY group event, whether a seminar, training session,
  concert, or religious event.

  From the aforementioned file, I recognized  the  three  stages  of Pavlov's
  transmarginal inhibition:  the equivalent phase, the paradoxical phase, and
  the ultra-paradoxical phase.

  Within a short  time,  most of the people in the audience  were  responding
  like trained seals,  clapping and agreeing with ANYTHING the "leader" said.
  Testimonials were used to nail down the "leader's" statements.

  Let me tell you, it was getting scary.   Tension  was  created,  with timed
  tests in half  of the time normally provided, as well as  with  abbreviated
  breaks, actually only  one  break  of  only 12 minutes, with only two rest-
  rooms available.

  The purpose of this procedure was to  induce  a  state  of catharsis in the
  minds of the  attendees, and then to hit them with a "follow  up"  seminar,
  for ONLY $395.00.  The follow up would GUARANTEE you that you would score
  at least 95% on the Postal Service exam.

  Your SALVATION from  the  otherwise  IMPOSSIBLE  ODDS  of passing the test.
  But, you had to respond quickly, because  there were only 16 seats left for
  the seminar, and the exam is opening up soon!

  This was the "logical" thing to do, since you'd already (whether you knew
  it or not) "agreed" by your catharsis and "yes set" responses.

  I'm not saying that these methods are illegal or morally wrong...everyone
  uses them, from advertisers to politicians, to religious figures.

  However, you SHOULD  have  an  awareness  of  these  powerful  manipulative
  techniques, because you have no natural immunity to them.  Even skepticism
  is no guarantee  that you won't be affected, and reading the MIND2.ASC will
  help you to fight against it, or at least  to recognize it so you can AVOID
  it.

  Personally, I went  to  encourage  my  18 year old son,  who  is  about  to
  graduate from high school, to look into the Postal Service as a career.

  He learned A LOT at that seminar, but more about manipulative methods than

                                     Page 1





  about opportunities with  the  Postal  Service.   That  alone was worth the
  twenty bucks, so I have no complaints.

  However, many of  the other attendees  described  themselves  as  poor  and
  desperate, increasing their  receptiveness  to  the message  of  this  self
  appointed "saviour".

  I left before  the  "call  to  the  faithful",  so  I  don't  know how many
  "converts" were made from this group.   Quite  a few, I'd guess.  I noticed
  that the doors  were  locked  as  I  was  leaving,  presumably  to  prevent
  interruption from OUTSIDE  the  room,  but  lkely  as a method to encourage
  people INSIDE from leaving before the seminar was over.

  Please download MIND2.ASC, print it,  and  share  copies with your friends.
  Read it before  you attend ANY group session.  The SAME  methods  that  are
  used to create  "moonies"  are  being  used on you, and you should learn to
  recognize the signs, if only in self defense.

  Ever notice that Bill Clinton always  uses  his  LEFT  hand when gesturing?
  It's to appeal to your right brain, and it's a proven technique!   Read the
  file!
