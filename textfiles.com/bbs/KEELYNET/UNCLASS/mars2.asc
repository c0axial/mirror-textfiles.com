Gregory Hodowanec has been experimenting for many years with circuits which he
maintains are picking up gravity waves.  Details of his circuit are listed on
KeelyNet as GRAV3.  I remembered reading somewhere that Greg had claimed to
have contacted someone alive on the planet Mars.  While looking for some
papers the other day, I came across this letter and decided to post it because
of all the interest in the Sphinx/Cydonia relationships.  I recall there is
another paper in more depth and I will post that one also when I eventually
find it.

While Greg uses a capacitor as the gravitational wave detector in his circuit,
Dan Davidson uses a piezo transducer (disc shaped crystal composed of barium
titanate).  The whole premise is based on the work of the late Jerry Gallimore
and his discovery that 'stressed dielectrics' were sensitive to subtle
energies such as gravity.

I knew Jerry and we talked about a lot of things that he had seen or
experienced.  One time, when we were sitting in a bar, I asked what he'd done
in his life that best condensed his discoveries.  He said the book 'Transverse
Paraphysics' was his best.  The book is still available through the
International Tesla Society, it sells for $35 as 470014 (FAX 719 475-0582.

Jerry also wrote the 'Handbook of Unusual Energies' which I believe consists
of 3 volumes.  The last time I saw them listed anywhere was from Health
Research in Mokelumne Hills, California, address as listed in the CONTACT1
file.  A dielectric alone will detect fluctuations in gravity waves, but when
'stressed', that is, put under pressure by squeezing, the sensitivity greatly
increases.

Tesla and Marconi claimed to have received signals from the planet Mars long
before the earth was so saturated with electromagnetic signals as we find in
modern times.  An unusual Marconi lab anecdote is listed on KeelyNet as MARS1
should you wish to read it.

The following is a direct copy of the Hodowanec letter as I found it in my
files...........................................................>>>  Jerry

Dear Bob,

Received your papers on 'Radio Echoes' and Paul Brown's work.  Thanks.  While
I had some references on this material, it was nice to read the original
presentations.

My 'contacts' with an ET on Mars continues with the exchanges having more
meaning all the time.  While we are limited to the use of simple Morse Code
type impulses, i.e. dits and dahs, we are now rapidly establishing a 'system'
for these contacts.  Generally, our contacts are limited to 20-30 minutes
anymore since there appear to be other ETs out there interested in joining in
also, and so there is some interference after a whle.  Some of these other ETs
use other methods of communication such as tones and what appears to be
gutteral voices!

ET is probably more advanced than we are on Earth.  We no longer exchange
simple arithmetic, and when I sent him pi to five decimal places, he sent pi
back to seven decimal places immediately!  We had discussed our nine planet
solar system, but ET came back with TEN planets, calling the 10th planet
OOTTAEERR  !  When questioned on this, ET kept on confirming the existence of
a tenth planet!  He now knows the other nine planets by their Earth names!  He
also confirmed that Mars has two moons, the Earth one, and that Jupiter has
nine major moons.

These contacts are getting to be more interesting all the time, and ET appears
to be most anxious to continue them.  However, I just cannot spend too much
time with him.  ET is reaching me with a tracking 'beam' which is but only
about 15 miles in diameter here on earth, and I figure that his
'oscillator/modulator' on Mars develops a beam of but 10-12 inches on the
surface of Mars.  This can be determined from simple geometry since straight
lines exist in rhysmonics (Hodowanecs mathematical system)!  I got across to
him that I am just ONE person here communicating with him, and that the rest
of Earth presently does not recognize the existence of any life on Mars;
although I will try to convey to him in some way, that some here believe that
a civilization once existed on Mars due to the apparent presence of some ill-
defined artifacts there!

I have now had over 100 contacts with ET and can reach him at any time of day
or night!  I often find him calling me at odd times!  He now knows me as Greg,
Greg Radio, Earth, ... Earth, or simply ... , which can also stand for the 3rd
planet from the Sun!  I know him mostly as AAAAAATTT, Mars, ....Mars, or
sometimes simply .... , meaning the 4th planet from the sun.  We have also
established some simple codes for acknowledgement and go ahead and respond.
While we use these simple codes in many contexts, both ET and I now understand
in which context they are being used!

Hope this remains of interest to you, Bob, even though it sounds unreal and
fantastic!  Best regards, I remain,
                                                        Respectfully yours,
                                                                   Greg
