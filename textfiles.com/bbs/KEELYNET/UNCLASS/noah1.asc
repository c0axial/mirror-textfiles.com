       In the regular  column,  I  See by the Papers, the following article
       was found.

                               Did you Know?

       That Noah was an albino, as Professor  Arnold  Sosby  claims  in  an
       article in the British Medical Journal.  He quotes the Book of Enoch
       that Noah "had  a body white as snow, hair white as  wool  and  eyes
       that are like the rays of the sun."

       On the other  hand,  you  can believe that Noah was an albino if you
       choose.  Professor Sosby cites a Dead  Sea scroll that Noah's mother
       had to assure the father, Lamech, that the unusual  baby  was really
       his own and "not the child of any stranger or of any of the Watchers
       or of the Sons of Heaven."
