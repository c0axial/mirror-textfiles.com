INSIGHTS INTO THE PROPRIETARY SYNDROME

PART I

To give you some background on myself, I have been interested in the energy
situation since I can remember.  I have built all kinds of devices, solar
energy panels, windmills, photovoltaic arrays, flywheel devices, and also
carburetors of which I will talk on Sunday.  In my background I am an
accomplished tool and diemaker, moldmaker, been involved in Design Engineering
for the past 12 years, primarily in the automation area.

My first real involvement with other people in this alternate energy area was
at the Toronto Symposium in 1981 where I met George Hathaway as well as over
100 other people that believe in the impossible according to orthodox science.
Since that time I have make myself aware of just about everything that is
happening in this field, and believe me there are some really fantastic things
going on.  The rediscovery of some of the technology that was lost in the past
is finally coming to realization, for instance the Tesla technology, the
Hubbard device, the Moray approach to tapping into the free energy supply that
we're sitting in without even knowing it.

A friend of mine gave me a real insight possibly without even knowing it.  He
said the problem could only be solved by just considering the problem of
weighing a glass of water at 500 feet under water.  Here you are under water
with a glass of water:  how do you weigh it???

The analogy is the same for us.  Here we sit in the vastness of the cosmos on
top of one of the biggest magnets known to us and we are like the glass of
water.  We are in the vast ocean of energy.  Look around us and watch just the
weather for instance, the next thunderstorm, think of all the electrical
potential being wasted.  That energy is there;  it is very real.

Tom Bearden, one of our upcoming speakers, may have illustrated it quite well
by the bird sitting on top of the wire with 13,000 volts going through it.  We
all know that it could kill him but is doesn't.  I am positive that within this
group will be the ways and means for making the energy situation of the future
change.

Now to the other side of this coin.  Why has not this technology been allowed
to become established?  We have to look at the 'profit motive' involved.  If we
have free energy, how will they charge for it?  What will happen to the
billions of dollars that the utilities and oil companies and the government
backing these establishments do if we can give the people independence from the
chains of having to pay for energy?

One question that has been uppermost in my mind for the last year has been the
rhetoric given by our elected representatives about the energy situation and
the amount of money given to small researchers who could possibly give us a
viable approach to becoming energy independent.  Who gets the government
money??  Let me get a little audience participation in the question.  How many
of you have all the money you need for research in the energy area?  Everyone
who has please stand!!!!!  Now let me mention a few of the names of the
companies that get the money.  See if you recognize them:  Exxon, Gulf Oil,
General Electric, Westinghouse, TRW, Exide Storage Battery, all manufacturers
or producers of fossil fuel products.  We need to get away from the fossil
fuels for the future and get into something that can indeed give us a future
because we are rapidly depleting not only our natural resources but our air
and water.  All because of burning fossil fuels.  We fund our universities and
colleges in the most directed of ways.  If you want to explore the
possibilities in some some of the more esoteric areas, for instance the ones
you will be hearing about in the next three days, there is no money for that.
WHY???  Because of the possibility that we might succeed.  What would our
government do if all the American people could go back and forth to work, heat
their homes, run their businesses without paying taxes on gas and oil?
Consider the fact that all of the gas stations would go out of business or
would have to find other ways of making money.  Many complimentary businesses
would also fold.  But alas, this is America.  What are we here for???  To
perpetuate Big Business, Big Government, or to advance toward the future, not
expending all of our natural resources but to save them to make the goods of
the future.  Coal and oil both can be used for making all kinds of things
besides fuels;  the list is endless.

It is my feeling that the technology may be already here and may have been
shown to the government.  It even may have been introduced to our patent office
and turned down.  Because as you know, there is no such thing as a perpetual
motion device.  And I agree with the premise because forever is a long time.

But there are surely some of the devices or parts thereof that have been
introduced to the government or to big business in the past which have been
shelved.  Tesla's transmission device is a classic illustration probably best
known to this group.  What happened is that they removed the money from him to
do his research and effectively stifled this remarkable man.  How many other
times has it happened to someone not so well known?  At this moment, there
are over 3,000 devices or applications in the patent office that have been
branded as security or put under wraps by the secrecy order, Title 35, U.S.
Code (1952) Sections 181-188.  What is security?  How is it defined?  I have
had many inventors or other scientists tell me that they did not want to
discuss their invention with me or others because they might lose it to us or
we might tell someone else before they got it onto the market.

Believe me, it won't get there by going through the patent process.  It is my
feeling that if such a device were introduced at this level, then it would be
put under the Secrecy Act.  I don't know that I am correct in this assumption.
But I cannot imagine a government like ours wanting to commit financial
suicide.  So what better way than to brand something as a secret?

I would like to read the Secrecy Order to you so that you may better understand
my concern.  Please pay close attention.  I think it is very important.  To you
or anyone!!!  Consider your receiving this:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECRECY ORDER
(Title 35, United States Code (1952), sections 181-188)

NOTICE:  To the applicant above named, his heirs, and any and all
         of his assignees, attorneys and agents, hereinafter designated
         principals:

You are hereby notified that your application as above identified has been
found to contain subject matter, the unauthorized disclosure of which might be
detrimental to the national security, and you are ordered in nowise to publish
or disclose the invention or any material information with respect thereto,
including hitherto unpublished details of the subject matter of said
application, in any way to any person not cognizant of the invention prior to
the date of the order, including any employee of the principals, but to keep
the same secret except by written consent first obtained of the Commissioner of
Patents, under the penalties of 35 U.S.C. (1952) 182, 186.

Any other application already filed or hereafter filed which contains any
significant part of the subject matter of the above identified application
falls within the scope of this order.  If such other application does not stand
under a security order, it and the common subject matter should be brought to
the attention of the Security Group, Licensing and Review, Patent Office.

If, prior to the issuance of the secrecy order, any significant part of the
subject matter has been revealed to any person, the principals shall promptly
inform such person of the secrecy order and the penalties for improper
disclosure.  However, if such part of the subject matter was disclosed to any
person in a foreign country or foreign national in the U.S., the principals
shall not inform such person of the secrecy order, but instead shall promptly
furnish to the Commissioner of Patents the following information to the extent
not already furnished:  date of disclosure;  name and address of the disclosee;
identification of such part;  and any authorization by a U.S. government agency
to export such part.  If the subject matter is included in any foreign patent
application, or patent, this should be identified.  The principals shall comply
with any related instructions of the Commissioner.

This order should not be construed in any way to mean that the Government has
adopted or contemplates adoption of the alleged invention disclosed in this
application;  nor is it any indication of the value of such invention.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is my feeling that something on the order of a so-called 'free energy
device' would receive this treatment.  My only approach would be to go to the
public domain.  That is, get the information or the device out there to enough
people that they could not stop you.  This group looks like the best group to
give this information to.  Hopefully it will forthcoming in the next three
days.
