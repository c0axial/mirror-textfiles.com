Meissner Fields

Some (to me) astounding correlations with 'static' magnetic fields have been
arising of late which I think need to be shared.   Let's break them down as
essentially being from 3 distinct sources (though there are more);

  1)  David Hudson
  2)  the KeelyNet file MAGSTUFF
  3)  the Dotto Ring

DAVID HUDSON
------------
David Hudson is the first person I ever heard refer to the aura as a Meissner
Field.  That led to a train of correlations which have been ongoing.  You see,
a Meissner Field is a superconducting - pure magnetic force which has no
internal resistance due to the supercooled state though they can occur at
other temperatures (room temp and higher).  Meissner Fields do not have to be
of enormous magnetic densities, but can exist as weak OR strong fields.

The point being, since the human body is created and sustained by such a
magnetic field (the aura), then once it reaches a state too weak to maintain
sufficient energy in the corporeal form, the field leaves the physical and
moves into a pure energy state, highly attenuated (weakened) and what we call
a 'ghost'.

David claims that rhodium, iridium and other elements, IN THEIR GHOST FORM
serves as 'food' FOR the aura.  He is referring to how such substances would
enhance the conductivity of the magnetic (Meissner) field.  Such an increase
in the aura density would cause the optimal reproduction of tissues in the
body, just as iron filings will follow the field lines of a magnet.  Not only
would it heal diseases, but it would rejuvenate the tissues and possibly
REVERSE AGING (as claimed by Dr. Gianni Dotto).  If a person were to be
exposed to an ever increasing AURIC (Meissner) field density due to ingestion
and saturation of the body with these superconducting substances, there will
come a time when the aura will be so much stronger than the physical that it
MUST 'translate' to another realm or dimension.  David says the person becomes
'5th' dimensional.  It would no longer hold to the physical form.

Along with this gradual increase in the aura field density, come 'paranormal'
powers such as being able to heal, transmute, manifest, levitate, experience
telepathy, etc.  All these phenomena are directly related to an 'expanded'
aura.  Mail/Contact Info : David Hudson, RT. 2, BOX 970, Laveen, AZ 85339 or

MAGSTUFF
--------
The earth's magnetosphere is, in fact, a singularity.  A large particle, as it
were.  The sun blows these magnetic bubbles which remain stable for long
periods of time.  (These take the form of toroids or donut shapes, just like
smoke rings...>>>  JWD)

Actually there is some one hundred and seventy year old mathematics (George
Green) which demonstrate the stability of these closed tubular magnetic
surfaces. More precisely these are toroidal structures.  These toroidal
structures or macroparticles create neutrons along their poloidal axis.  Yes,
actually create them by topological transformations of the singularity's field
itself.  It creates little miniatures of itself (which happen to be neutrons).
And if the magnetosphere is large enough and intense enough they create TONS
PER SECOND.

As the magnetosphere orbits along the solar equatorial plane (lowest energy
state) the neutrons produced are gravitationally localized by the
macroparticle's (read magnetosphere's) gravitational field.  It is the only
thing that could keep the neutrons localized.  Next, the neutrons break down
into protons, electrons, and anti-neutrinos.  The protons are enriched in the
neutron soup to deuterium, then tritium.  The tritium by beta decay converts
to He3 and the He3 gets enriched to He4 and so on until every species of the
periodic table is formed.  Eventually, the core of the magnetosphere is
enclosed by gross matter and you have the early stage of planetary formation.
At this point it might be termed a proto-planet or a pre-proto (or comet).  As
the magnetosphere continues to produce more and more mass the planet grows.

After a sufficiently long time one would think that the magnetosphere
(macroparticle) would be used up.  But, just as the earth's magnetosphere can
energetically couple with solar disturbances (which happen to expand the
magnetosphere into an excited state) it can be replenished.  Incidently, the
magnetosphere acts like a giant particle when excited by solar eruptions.
(This is an indication that these toroids, when they begin to decay, can be
RECHARGED!!....>>>  JWD)

It expands such that radiation belts found normally at 1 radii are then found
at 8-10 radii.  Over days the magnetosphere drops back down (going through
metastable states like a particle) to its ground state.  As it does this it
also emits long wavelength photons from the poles which can have wavelengths
measured in light hours.  Of course, no one saw them.  They weren't looking
for them.  A photon at such an incomprehensible scale would sneak by as a
changing polar electric field (associated with the borealis).  We have some
pretty good proof that this model is fundamentally correct.  Ball lightning (a
natural phenomenon) is a smaller more intense version of a planetary
magnetosphere.  However, experimental evidence that it creates neutrons out of
its own field structure is mounting fast.

If you can't begin to get the picture and how this will effect cosmology (as a
new theory) and physics, and eventually (trickling down) geology (not to
mention health!!...JWD) - then you are not paying attention or have never been
interested in the magnetosphere's of the planets.  Look up an article in
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vanguard Sciences / KeelyNet  *  PO BOX 870716  * Mesquite, TX  * 75187 USA
'science news' about 18 years ago which stated "The Sun is Forever Blowing
Bubbles".  Look up another one which was titled (I think) "What was that, a
comet?" Seems the magnometers on a spacecraft flipped back and forth as the
magnetic surface of an otherwise undectable magnetosphere was passed through.
It seemed like the bow shock of a comet but no comet was visible (and it
should have been visible).  As the magnetospheres depart the solar atmosphere
they are no longer detectable because they no longer shape or order the
stellar plasma flows as they did when they passed through it (whose photonic
emissions make the structure of the magnetosphere briefly visible).

The moon doesn't have a magnetosphere but evidence shows that it once did.
Uranus and Neptune testify that their magnetospheres are not related to the
spin of the planet, having 60 and 50 degrees (I believe) planet axis tilt with
respect to magnetic axis. And they are not in the center of the planet.

Consider Mercury which doesn't spin fast enough to generate a field but has a
healthy one anyway (which incidently is 1/3 displaced from the physical center
of the planet).  Some planets are dead, no longer growing, because their field
either completely converted into ordinary mass by neutron genesis or was
displaced from the planet by interactions with another planet's field. But at
least get this picture: "The magnetosphere is not generated by the planet but
the planet is generated by the magnetosphere."

Remember the '5th Force' geophysicists thought they found?  It was the
gravitational field associated with the macroparticle.  Each 'live' planet
(one with an active magnetosphere) has two gravitational fields associated
with it.  One associated with combined mass of the elements which comprise the
planet (gross matter) and one which is the gravitational field of the
macroparticle/magnetosphere.  We'll call the field from the macroparticle the
Mag/g field and the one from the raw mass of the planet we'll call the Mass/g
field.  The Mag/g field intensifies with depth while the Mass/g field
decreases with depth.  The Mag/g field acceleration near the planetary core
can be so great that very exotic species of elements CAN EXIST AS STABLE
ELEMENTS.  For example, consider a mythical species which I shall call
Isaacium which could have 500 protons and 740 neutrons AW = 1240.  Isaacium
could exist as a totally stable element under a gravitational field that was
of sufficient intensity.

Experiments with atomic clocks in the basement and at the top of a tall
building demonstrated that the clock at the lower level ran slower than the
clock at the top.  Why? Because the acceleration due to gravity was greater
near the surface than at the top of the building.  Time dilation is not
related to the velocity of Special Relativity but rather to the acceleration
normally associated with General Relativity.  Well, in the case of the
strength of the gravitational field near the core (the Mag/g field here) the
acceleration could be millions of times what it is at the surface.  If the
magnetosphere were to be suddenly displaced from the core of the planet it is
conceivable that a great deal of matter in the core could instantly go
supercritical which might actually disrupt the integrity of the planet (blow
it up) and scatter it in space.  Holy shades of asteroid belts!

Here's the deal.  Planets grow.  Read S. Warren Carey's book: Title =
"Theories of the Earth and Universe"  {A History of Dogma in the Earth
Sciences}  Published in 1988 by Stanford Univ. Press.  Cost is about $45
U.S.. - ISBN 0-8047-1364-2   S. Warren Carey is the author.  He is Professor
Emeritus of Geology at the University of Tasmania; an Honorary Life Fellow of
the Geological Societies of America, London, and Australia; and former
President of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of

Science; also Fellow of the Royal Society, I believe.  He has been collecting
the evidence for an explanding planet for longer than many of us have been
alive.

I simply have come up with a mechanism (which was developed before I heard of
Carey's work) that explains his irrefutable expansion data.  He has other
mechanisms which are somewhat plausible even though I tend to favor my own
devices (which have some experimental proof).  If you give an honest shake to
Carey's work you also will come away knowing that planets grow; and not by
accretion of interstellar dust.  How anyone can still believe that utter
hogwash is beyond me.  I'm ashamed that I once believed it.  If you are true
men and women you will also be ashamed but at once delighted that something
more plausible has arrived.

Planets do grow - from the inside out!  Carey's work, among other things,
points to the geologically expressed tensional features of supposed subduction
zones. Subduction was introduced because no one could conceive of any
mechanism for planetary growth.  I urge you all to look at the evidence that
Carey and others have collected and then look into your hearts and find the
integrity necessary to no longer go along with the crowd.  You can be part of
a new paradigm that will eventually emerge with or without your assistance.
Truth is suppressible; but only for so long.  It will spring forth in the end.
If we didn't have confidence in that (as scientists) why would we even be in
science?

As I stated, there is a ton of evidence that this is true.  But there is also
a ton and one half of evidence that very few people will believe it to be true
stuck as they are in the rotten tottering paradigms of the past.  Will we, as
Max Plank indicated, have to wait until everyone of the old generation is
dead?  Will we have to wait that long?  Until a new generation comes up that
is familiar with these ideas?  Tell me it isn't true.  Are we unable to
embrace the truth?  This model has explanations for the positive correlation
between earthquakes and sunspots.  It also predicts that we have 'earthspots'
where magnetic loops exit and re-enter the surface (just like on the sun).
Problem is we can't see the 'earthspots' because there is no plasma (excited
gas state) to reveal its existence.  Rotating 'Indian Ocean Wheel Lights'
reported numerous times in the Marine Observer and elsewhere are examples of
those magnetic loops.

The changing magnetic field of an 'earth mag loop' gives rise to an electric
field which stimulates phosphorescent organisms into unique patterns of huge
rotating wheel spokes.  See Rutherford, W.; Marine Observer 30:128-129, 1960
also Pringle, J. Eliot; Nature, 20:291, 1889 also Barth, H.; Marine Observer,
24:74-75, 1954 and Hocking, R. W.; Marine Observer, 7:240, 1930.

Because 'earth mag loops' reflect a disturbance in the magnetosphere's
structure one might consider that perturbations in the macroparticle's field
could give rise to local variations in the gravitational field at depth (read
Mag/g field here). If the field at great depth over some small region were to
suddenly be diminished it could cause some volume of high 'Z' mass (mentioned
earlier and thought to normally be stable due to the intensity of the Mag/g
field at depth) to go supercritical and generate a nuclear explosion which
could be the cause of deep rooted earthquakes.  Nearer the surface we might
detect earthquake lights and fast variations in the surface field or even in
the magnetic orientation of surface rocks.  This was actually seen in
California within the last ten years (surface rock suddenly changing their
magnetic orientation - associated with an earthquake).

Fast changing magnetic fields generate huge electric fields which can ionize
the air at the ground level (or higher).  Also, these fast changing fields
could also stimulate some underlying quartz bearing granitic material into
piezo-electrically induced ground motion.

The Dotto Ring
--------------
One of the most amazing documents I have ever been privileged to study is by a
Dr. Gianni Dotto.  He did cancer research for the Sloan-Kettering Institute in
Kalamazoo.  His research showed an astounding comprehension of electronics,
chemistry, physics, physiology, biology and other sciences as well as how they
all correlated to life, health and creation.  An acquaintance from New York
claims to have visited Dr. Dotto at his private lab in France in 1993.  At
that time, Dotto was in process of moving to an island location to avoid
disruption by people seeking to contact him.

The electronic machine Dotto developed not only was claimed to cure cancer and
other diseases, but also to suspend aging.  When the 'Ring' was energized, it
also levitated off the floor.

Without going into too much detail, Dotto claims that a very high current
(30,000 amperes) can be produced with almost no voltage.  This is in effect a
Meissner Field.  When living tissues are exposed to this field, it energizes
and corrects the body by what I now believe is an intensification of the aura.
Kind of like an inductive EEMAN screen where the weakened and faded aura is
recharged.  Since the aura forms and sustains the physical body, anything you
can do to increase its energy will improve health.

The following is from the file DNAMAST1 on KeelyNet:

  Aging and the reproduction of defective DNA is caused by a lack of cellular
  vitality which is brought about by a twisting of the DNA helix as the
  organism ages.  Since the DNA molecule only has a given number of base pairs
  (stair steps) due to its fixed length, this twisting adds more turns which
  consequently reduces the number of base pairs in each turn.  Effectively,
  the # YEARS / # TURNS = # BASE PAIRS available per turn.  As the organism
  goes through the birth, maturation and death cycle, the DNA helix twists to
  "squeeze" out the number of base pairs (stair steps) per turn, this can be
  shown by the following :

  The DNA of the embryo cell in a mothers womb contains 46 base pairs per
  turn.  In the 6th week of pregnancy, the DNA in the embryo cell has 34 base
  pairs per turn.  In the 10th lunar month, a single DNA (half from the
  mother, half from the father) has reproduced itself more than 6 trillion
  times.  When the baby is born, the process of reproduction decreases due to
  the rapid twisting of the DNA helix.

  At the age of 2 years, the DNA has twisted to reduce the number of base
  pairs to 22 per turn.  At the age of 21, the base pairs are 14 per turn.
  From the age of 35 to about 55, the base pairs stabilize somewhat at 10 per
  turn.  At around 55 years of age and beyond, the 10 base pairs per turn
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vanguard Sciences / KeelyNet  *  PO BOX 870716  * Mesquite, TX  * 75187 USA
  reduce to 6 and continue to decrease until the organism achieves death.

  The kinetic energy of the electrons in the Hydrogen bonds coupled with the
  reduced energy of the charged ions from the nervous system are so weak that
  the DNA stops reproducing itself and the aging process begins to wreak havoc
  with the body.  In addition, the steadily reducing number of base pairs as
  life progresses acts to slowly reduce the vitality of the system on a
  cellular level.  This makes the "scanning" of the RNA by the DNA
  increasingly sensitive to outside sources of interference.

  If these outside sources of interference are applied while the "scanning"
  process is occurring, the resulting pattern will be more or less distorted
  from the original.  If this occurs en masse, cancer and a host of other
  diseases can occur.  Indications are that there are two beneficial effects
  which result from application of these concepts.

  1)  Disease can be halted and the body restored to optimum health by the
      restoration of the DNA to the maximum vitality.  The DNA pattern is no
      longer subject to outside distortion and therefore becomes self-
      optimizing.

  2)  Aging can be halted and reversed by as much as 30 years (Dotto's
      original estimation) dependent on the desired cellular vitality based on
      the number of base pairs per turn.  Hair darkens, skin tightens,
      digestion improves, hormones and enzymes resurge, etc..

  The technique involves the application of an inductive field to irradiate
  the body for a short time.  The longer the body is within the field, the
  more optimized DNA replications will occur due to the intensified field.

    (Just as microwaved food continues to 'heat' after being removed from
     the oven, just as lightning bugs shine brightly and fade before the next
     'kick', just as a tuning fork will vibrate for minutes after being
     struck, just as cells exposed to Ultraviolet light will re-radiate that
     light when removed from the source, so too can the aura be
     stimulated...>>> JWD)

  Each replication will create a DNA strand which possesses successively
  higher vitalities. Ever increasing cellular energy slowly "untwists" the DNA
  which increases the number of base pairs per turn.  The result is reversal
  of aging and restoration of the DNA to an optimum pattern.  This restoration
  also dissipates the patterns which allow disease to exist in the body.

  During the time of the exposure, the natural replication of DNA under the
  influence of an inductive energy field would cause the "new" DNA to be
  copied with the desired number of base pairs.  This is brought about by an
  artifically induced lengthening of the Tesla coil secondary which increases
  the amount of electrical potential.

  This increased electrical potential on a cellular level "untwists" the DNA
  helix which allows more base pairs (stair steps) PER TURN to be copied for
  each duplication.  This gradual increase in cellular vitality automatically
  gives the DNA/RNA scanning process more energy to both record and update
  the old pattern with a fresh, 'aura perfect' duplicate.  This in turn,
  increases the rate of duplication for the removal of dead and dying tissues
  in the body.  Thus wrinkles, toxins and various other problems which degrade
  the efficiency of the organism are removed.  Youth and maximum health is
  restored and maintained through periodic application of the inductive field.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vanguard Sciences / KeelyNet  *  PO BOX 870716  * Mesquite, TX  * 75187 USA
  Thinking in Tesla coil terms, a primary coil with a winding of 10 turns is
  inductively coupled to a secondary winding of 100 turns.  If a current of 1
  ampere at 10 volts is applied to the primary, a voltage of (10:100 or 1:10)
  100 volts at 100 milliamps will be developed at the secondary.

  (Note...as of 04/95, in light of this new set of correlations, I don't know
   that a Tesla coil secondary analogy still applies.  This is because of the
   inverse nature of a transformer (Tesla coil) where voltage and current are
   reciprocal to each other.  If we wanted to excite the Meissner (aura)
   field, by its very nature of being nearly pure magnetic energy, it follows
   that a transformer secondary should have LESS WINDINGS to INCREASE the
   magnetic current and DECREASE the voltage.

  If the DNA is thought of as being a secondary and the number of base pairs
  (stair steps) per turn is equivalent to the windings in a secondary, we can
  see how a reduction in windings or stair steps would result in less
  electrical potential (cellular vitality).  This in turn making the DNA
  progressively sensitive to outside stimuli for an eventual mix-up and
  distortion in the DNA pattern.  These DNA distortions directly affect the
  formation of the enzyme-controlling genes which control all cellular
  functions.   Without intelligent control of the duplication process, aging,
  disease and or death are inevitable.

All this is intended to show that the Meissner field can exist at all sorts of
densities and thus can be USED in a practical sense to expand the energy
density of the aura to induce healing and rejuvenation.  Not to mention its
ability to create mass from seemingly nothing and with a velocity dependent on
the aura density.  It should also affect transmutation and energy experiments.

Fast Flash

A recent Scientific American article (February 1995, 50 and 100 Years Ago,
page 8) had a fascinating quote from a February 1945 SciAm;

  "A photographic technique has been worked out that is so sensitive it could
   presumably take a picture of a ghost, if there actually were such things.
   This new process, utilizing an illuminating flashlight with an exposure of
   less than one millionth of a second, photographs things which are
   INVISIBLE, such as the finest details of air disturbances even to the
   extent of making an image of a heat wave rising from the palm of one's
   hands."

It struck a chord because of the amazing photographs of Dr. Edgerton and
others in high speed flash photography, particularly the odd comment about
being able to take a picture of a ghost.  In many UFO cases where clear
photographs have been produced, the person who took the photo does NOT
remember seeing anything odd or unusual at the location or time of the photo.
In those few cases where the 'entities' have explained what is happening, such
as the Meier case, we are told their ships have been altered to vibrate in
slices of our time frames, making them invisible to our 'normal' perceptions.

The human eye needs a minimum of 24 frames per second to produce a relatively
smooth transition from frame to frame without flicker.  So what happens
between those frames?  The late Itzhak Bentov called it a flicker on, flicker
off existence.  Does the universe or just the local environment recreate
itself each time our consciousness is directed towards it?  Probably neither.
It makes more sense to envision two alternate ways of thinking about it.  One
where a second is chopped up into innumerable slices, the other where there
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vanguard Sciences / KeelyNet  *  PO BOX 870716  * Mesquite, TX  * 75187 USA
are other 'phases' of existence, otherwise known as dimensions.  This follows
the claims of quantum realities as discussed in the Incunabula files (INCUNAB1
& INCUNAB2 & ONGSHAT on KeelyNet).  The point here is that a camera taking a
photograph does NOT have the same flicker on, flicker off of human 'sense
based perceptions' (a Walter Russell term) and so can pick up activity that is
invisible to us.  When a camera is set for the base shutter, it keeps the film
exposed for as long as the shutter is kept manually opened, capturing very
slow movements.  A fast exposure, if it happens to hit the correct portion of
the phased temporal reality, could very well capture an 'invisible' event.

All the digital systems are controlled by a clock or fixed oscillator that
necessarily chops up any frequencies that are being sampled.  This is one of
the reasons digital multimeters cannot be used as accurate measuring tools for
some circuits, such as over-unity or F/E.

Water and Surface Tension

A flyer for a new product came in the mail recently advertising a new device
that would 'treat' water and other substances to make them healthier for you.
The device used a piezo transducer (flat crystal) emitting one or more
frequencies and the claim was that the surface tension of water was INCREASED.

Since cells and life processes are enhanced by being able to absorb water as
easily as possible.  The higher the surface tension, the harder it is for the
cells to absorb and utilize the water.  The 'Crystal Water' that Patrick and
Gael Flanagan have researched and sell, has a greatly REDUCED surface tension,
thus making it easier to absorb, thereby enhancing the life giving abilities.

In a very amusing private email, Patrick pointed this out to the inventor and
asked this inventor what kind of and how much research HE HAD DONE to come to
this inverted conclusion.  The reply was 4 months.  As opposed to the over 80
years of combined research done by the Flanagans that has resulted in the
discovery of colloidal micro-clusters.  How was an INCREASE of surface tension
supposed to be beneficial to life processes?

A similar phenomenon is associated with the discoveries of Albert Roy Davis
and Walter Rawls (magnetic monopoles).  It was noted that South pole magnetic
energies caused matter to expand.  When applied to water, it became easier to
absorb, believed to be due to this expansion and the associated reduction in
surface tension.  To my knowledge, a test was not made of the actual surface
tension but the effects were similar.  In fact, they discovered that North
pole magnetic energies caused contraction of matter and when applied to water,
either flowing or static, would reduce the growth of bacteria because it took
more energy for the bacteria to use this now 'tighter bound' water.

(By the way, J.W. McGinnis and Steve Elsewicke of the International Tesla
Society in Colorado Springs, were in Dallas this past month and J.W. says
Walter Rawls will be speaking at the 1995 Tesla Conference towards the last of
July.  This is amazing as Walter rarely speaks in public, so don't miss this!)

SchadenFreude (shah-den-froi-deh)

A couple of years or so back, PBS had a documentary showing the traversing of
Germany's waterways in a medium sized boat.  During WWII, the Germans had
set up dams or re-routed the connections of the various waterways.  Some were
no longer connected.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vanguard Sciences / KeelyNet  *  PO BOX 870716  * Mesquite, TX  * 75187 USA
In order to get the boat to the different rivers, it had to be transported by
truck from river to river.  In this movement over land, the makers of the
documentary seemed besieged with many problems.  One time the boat slid off
the trailer, another time the trailer axle broke, another time they could not
get under a bridge and had to take a long route to their destination, etc..
In each of these instances, the producers noted that many of the Germans stood
by, laughing up their sleeves at each of these misfortunes.  The producers
could not understand this obvious display of mirth at their problems and were
told there was a German word that was used to describe the attitude.  It was
very funny to me because who among us has not at times been quietly amused at
the occasional mishaps of others, (hopefully just those which were not serious
or that only caused minimal damage).

Since that PBS episode, I have been trying to find out what the word was and
just this past week, I met a German fellow named Rudi who knew it.  The word
is 'Schadenfreude', pronounced 'shah-den-froi-deh' with emphasis on the
'Schad'.  Schaden refers to misery or misfortune, Freude to joy, mirth or
pleasure.  It simply refers to taking pleasure, joy or amusement when you see
someone experiencing difficulties.  In some ways, I think it might even be
satisfaction and a form of teaching from 'being allowed' to see universal law
in action in the form of payback.

Why such a maledictive interest in this attitude?  It just makes sense that we
learn by observation and so, we should take every opportunity to learn from
others errors or even something as 'fetched' as 'closure' of a circle.  These
circles take the form of good or bad actions which INEVITABLY and IRREVOCABLY
catch up with you. Some people think of it as windows or 'runs' of bad luck,
but I prefer the old saying 'What goes around, comes around - MULTIPLIED'.
This is the nature of the cycle, a slow build to maturation, then an ever
faster decay to closure.  This cycle phenomenon just happens to apply to free
energy and gravity control if you can see it.  Such a closure has happened to
me in the recent past, with an operation after nearly 40 years of perfect
health, then a car accident which had never happened before.  And on pondering
WHY these things happened, I DID find things I had done in the past which I
feel were the closing of a circle, returning as lessons or 'payback'
(depending on your perspective, i.e., is the glass 1/2 empty or 1/2 full?).

Puppies

On a recent evening radio talk show, an elderly lady called in with an
excellent joke referring to a 'weaning' process FROM government controls.

  Hilary Clinton was walking near the White House one day and noticed a small
  boy sitting on the steps of a closed McDonalds.  Next to the young man was a
  cardboard box.  Hilary asked the little boy what was in the box and he
  replied, 'Puppies!'  She asked what kind of puppies and the little boy said
  'Democratics!'

  Finding this reply very amusing, Hilary made a point of telling Bill about
  it that evening.  He wanted to talk to the sharp witted child but could not
  find the time.  A few days later, while jogging near the McDonalds', Clinton
  remembered the little boy.  He detoured towards the building and sure
  enough, the little boy was still there with the cardboard box.  Bill walked
  up and asked the child what was in the box, to which the boy again replied
  'Puppies'.  Clinton asked if they were 'Democratic puppies?' and the boy
  said 'Nope, these puppies have their eyes open, so they must be
  Republicans!'
