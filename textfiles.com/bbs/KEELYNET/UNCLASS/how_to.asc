             Uploading Ansi (or other) messages to a Wildcat database

       First of all  i don't really claim to know alot about Wildcat, but I
       run a BBS (The Oilfields BBS), and  I, along with many other Sysop's
       wanted to know just how to post a color (ANSI) ad in  a message area
       of a bbs, I have 4 or 5 such ads on my board and set out to find the
       anwser, well after 2 long nights this is what I came up with:

        The message  area  in  Wildcat will accept only 73 characters long,
        this is important to remember because  this also means ansi control
        characters as  well,  when entering an ansi message  if  a  control
        character goes  over  73  characters  long it will wrap around, and
        cause you message to be deformed,  I  use  THEDRAW for making these
        type of messages, basically because it easy to use.

        In using the Draw, if you start your message in column  1, when you
        save it   in   the   ansi   form  The  Draw  will  ask  you  "Video
        Preparation?", Choose Clear Screen,  then the next question is very
        important "Maximum Output Line Length?".

        If you started in column 1, you can choose 73 (the  default  is 255
        which is  great  for making screens, but not for ansi messages), if
        you started your ansi message in  column 3, save your message at 70
        "Maximum Output Line Length" (70 characters long)

        The trick is to not go over 73 characters long including  any  ansi
        control characters, and when saving your message choose the fastest
        display which is 0.

        Just one  other note in saving your message The Draw will report to
        you how many lines it took to save  your message, be sure not to go
        over 150  lines,  (thats  all Wildcat will accept  in  the  message
        aera), it's not really that hard you may have to try it a few times
        to get  it  right, but it sure is worth it I would say I have added
        maybe 100 users to my board by using  these  ansi  messages, by the
        way you can also make animated messages the same way!

        I have included two screens both the same, one save at 73

                                      Page 1





        characters long  and  the  other save at The Draw defaults, look at
        both screens  in  a  good  ansi  editor,  you  will  notice  a  big
        difference, but if you have ansi.sys installed in  your config.sys,
        uses the DOS command type <screen>.scr, and the output is the same,
        the one screen that was saved at 70 characters long is a uploadable
        ansi message.

        To upload to a message area of Wildcat you must have comm. software
        that supports  the  ASCII  file  transfer,  most  do,  when you are
        prompted to enter your message,  start  your  upload, directly into
        the message editor of Wildcat.

        Some other important notes, this will work great with  Wildcat 2xx,
        and up I don't know about earlier ver. of Wildcat, it also works on
        other bbs  software that supports ansi in the message area, but for
        some reason I can't upload a ansi  message  in  the new 3.0 ver. of
        Wildcat, I don't know if this is a bug or what, but  it  just don't
        accept it.

        If you get all this figured out and don't have a place to post your
        new colorful,  animated  BBS ad, give my board a call, and post it,
        any sysop may do so.
