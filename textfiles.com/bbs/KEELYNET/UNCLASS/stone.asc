                                    STONEHENGE
                              "From Whence Came You?"

       STONEHENGE!  An ancient structure  filled  with mystery; the subject
       of speculation and rumor studied and analyzed by generations of men.

       Scientists and producers of fanciful mystique alike  have found it a
       challenge which thwarts the analytical minds and the discerning eyes
       of man!

       What is this strange and little known edifice which stands alone and
       aloof on the Plains of Salisbury?

       To quote a statement by Russell A. Herner, author of "Stonehenge: An
       Ancient Masonic Temple." :

          "I contend  that  this majestic structure is, in fact, an Ancient
           Masonic Temple. This structure, or Temple as I will call it, has
           survived the lapse of time, the ruthless hands of ignorance, and
           the devastations of war for many centuries."

       The author does not equivocate;  he  does  not  apologize;  he does,
       however, theorize very convincingly.  Let's look at  this phenomenon
       on the open plains of Southwest England.

       Salisbury Plain is in Wiltshire, England, about seven miles from the
       town of Salisbury.   On  the  flat plain surrounding Stonehenge, one
       can see large burial mounds similar  to  those  found  in the United
       States (Moundsville, West Virginia, for example).

       Unanswered questions come flooding into one's mind as the mystery of
       Stonehenge is viewed as it spreads over the plain.

       How was it  built?  - What genius supplied the scientific  knowledge
       which made it possible? - When was it built - and by whom? Questions
       unanswered now, and  possibly  for  all  time.   This  was  no small
       undertaking which our ancient craftsman  took  upon  themselves.  IT
       WAS MONUMENTAL!!

                             Imagine what they faced!

       No high-tech equipment  which today's builders use so routinely!  No
       colleges teaching today's technology and sciences!  Quarries for the
       special stones located from 20 to  240  miles  away!   No  beasts of
       burden - only  man's  backs and strong limbs.  A river  between  the
       quarries and the building site!

       A project of a magnitude exceeding the Sears Tower in Chicago or the
       Bay Bridge in   California.    For  building  such  modern  projects
       involved many tasks which individually were not difficult. -

       Building Stonehenge involved many tasks which individually seemed
       insurmountable!  To the average mind  today  it  was  the impossible
       dream!  But there  it  stands  for  all  to  see:  the   improbable,
       impossible, inconceivable project.  Completed by a culture which we
       consider to be uneducated and without artistic temperament.

       At a point  directly  Northeast  of  the  center of the Altar Stone,
       there is a break in the circular embankments  for  an avenue, nearly
       40 feet wide which leads to the only element of Stonehenge  which is
       outside this circle.   The  "Heelstone"  is  a massive stone 20 feet
       high with 4 feet buried in the plain.   It  is planted at an incline
       of 27 degrees toward the center of the structure.   It  is estimated
       to weigh over  35  tons and is 256 feet from the center of the Altar
       Stone.

       Just within the embankments ia a  stone  3  feet thick, 7 feet wide,
       and nearly 22  feet  long.   This is thought to be  the  spot  where
       animals were slaughtered as offerings to Deity.

       More is involved  in  the  construction of Stonehenge than meets the
       casual view.  It is located and constructed  by  an exact scientific
       formula from which  can  be derived much scientific  data  and  many
       astrological readings.  Just  inside the Aubrey Holes there are four
       Station Stones forming a rectangle  108  feet  8 inches wide and 262
       feet 3 inches  long  with  its long dimension perpendicular  to  the
       Northeast axis.  At  this  latitude  of  51 degrees 17 minutes North
       Latitude, lines drawn through these  four stones plot the rising and
       setting positions of the sun and moon at midsummer and midwinter.

       If Stonehenge were moved as little as 30 miles, this rectangle would
       have to be laid out as a parallelogram without right angled corners.

       At the summer solstice (about June 21) the sun rises  directly  over
       the tip of  the  Heelstone; its rays passing through the Sarsen Arch
       and striking the center of the Altar  Stone.  (That one archway is 6
       inches wider than all the rest.)

       With this in mind, picture, if you will, this scene which may
       - or may not - be purely imaginative.

       It is night.  The darkness is broken only by a candle  or  two  - or
       perhaps by the  dim  light  of  a  setting  moon.   A  group of men,
       marching in double file, enter the Sarsen Circle.  They are dressed
       in ancient costumes  of leather and  rough,  homespun  cloth.   They
       carry implements of the builders trades.



                                      Page 2





       In the center  of  the group, walking between the columns and guided
       by two of the ancients, is a young man - an initiate.

       They circumambulate the Sarsen Circle,  stopping at strategic points
       while voices from the darkness instruct and admonish the initiate in
       their midst.  As dawn approaches they pass through  the  open end of
       the Trilithons, into  the  Bluestone  Horseshoe,  and wend their way
       Southeastward until the initiate  and  the  guides  stand behind the
       Altar Stone, at its center, facing Northeast.

       The rest of the group file slowly back until they form a double line
       from the Altar  Stone  to  the Sarsen Arch at the Extreme  Northeast
       limit of the Circle.

       All is quiet.  The darkness dims.  The initiate has time to think on
       what he has been told and the things he has seen.

       The circles of  stone  about the group shut out nearly all the light
       as dawn grows near.

       Suddenly a glow appears and a guide  turns  the initiate's head with
       the command: "Look to the East!"

       The entire area is encompassed by two earthen embankments  separated
       by a ditch  17  feet  wide.  The inner embankment rises 7 feet above
       the plain to reduce the possibility  of  cowans  and  eavesdroppers.
       The outer mound is approximately 400 feet in diameter.

       Within this circle, at a diameter of 286 feet, are  56  pits (called
       "Aubrey Holes") filled with solid chalk.  Several of these have been
       excavated and found  to contain human bones, spawning the assumption
       that they are burial spots for the  leaders or officers of those who
       used the site.

       Further toward the  center, with an inside diameter  of  97  feet  4
       inches, is the  main  part  of  the structure: a circle of 30 stones
       nearly 4 feet thick, 7 feet wide,  and  standing  13  feet  6 inches
       above ground.

       At a diameter of 77 feet is a circle of Bluestones,  6 feet 7 inches
       high in the Southwest, tapering to 2 feet 4 inches in the Northeast.

       We now approach  the  "Inner  Sanctum"  of  Stonehenge.  A horseshoe
       formation of 5 huge stone groups called  "Trilithons"  with the open
       end to the Northeast.  These mammoth units consist of 3 stones each.
       Two upright members varying in height from 25 feet  6  inches in the
       center of the closed end of the horseshoe to 20 feet above ground at
       the open end.   The third stone forms a lintel across the top and is
       15 feet 5 inches long (the width of two uprights).  These stones are
       about 3 feet thick and 7 feet wide  and,  at  the top, are carved in
       the form of a mortise and tenon joint to hold the lintel in place.

       Within this impressive  group  is  a  second  horseshoe   of   round
       Bluestones 2 feet in diameter varying in height from 9 feet 3 inches
       at the closed  end  to  6  feet  6  inches  at  the  end open to the
       Northeast.  These are set at a diameter of 39 feet.

       Central to all the other parts of  the  structure  is one of the two
       most important elements.  It lies flat on the ground and is a green

                                      Page 3





       stone with flecks  of  mica  throughout.   It measures nearly 2 feet
       thick, 3 feet 3 inches wide and 15  feet 9 inches long.  This is the
       "Altar Stone."

       Some mention should  be  made  of  the  two color elements  used  in
       Stonehenge's construction: the  green  Altar  and  the two Bluestone
       units.  Mackey's Encyclopedia of Freemasonry has this statement:

           "In all the Ancient Mysteries,  this  idea  was carried out with
            Green symbolizing the birth of the world, of the moral creation
            or resurrection of the initiate."

       Thus we have the theory that the initiate took his obligation on the
       Green Altar Stone at Stonehenge: "the creation or resurrection  of a
       new life."  The  Bluestones are thought to be indicative of the blue
       which is indelibly attached to Masonry.   From  all  ages  blue  has
       symbolized truth, sincerity, and fidelity.  Further,  Masons  met in
       outdoor Lodges under  the  blue  canopy  of Heaven - thus, today, we
       meet in "Blue Lodges."

       A sudden shaft of light bursts through  the  Sarsen  Arch as the sun
       rises directly over the tip of the Heelstone.  It crosses  the space
       within the Circle - strikes the Altar Stone - and shines directly on
       the face of the Initiate!

          LIGHT!!!

       The Initiate has  received  the LIGHT.  After further instruction he
       is admitted to the inner circle of  these  rough  men  who, somehow,
       know many things of science and nature.

                                A FINAL THOUGHT

       Imagery???  Perhaps. - Perhaps not!  We may never know;  but this is
       an indisputable fact: the construction of Stonehenge, like the Great
       Pyramid of Giza,  was done with knowledge that would be difficult to
       find, even today.   It  is  done with  scientific  skill  which  was
       thought to be  developed many centuries after these  men  lived  and
       died.  The "How" and "Why" we may never understand, but the facts
       remain.

       An Ancient Masonic  Lodge???  Who knows?  And, one may ask: "Does it
       really matter?" For whatever we choose  to believe about Stonehenge,
       it offers material   for   intriguing  hypothesizing   and   endless
       interesting conversations.  My  Brothers  -  I  give you the Mystery
       that is Stonehenge!"
