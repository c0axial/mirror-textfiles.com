       Bert Pool's PGP cookbook:

       PGP has great  encryption  software,  but the documentation does NOT
       present the "how to" in a very useable  order.  All the instructions
       are in there, somewhere, but the information is NOT  ordered so that
       you can "abc" it and DO something!

       Below is my PGP cookbook, with four basics steps to setup PGP so you
       can send and receive encrypted data.  Enjoy.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       In order to use PGP you have to, in this order:

       a) create a  secure  "private"  key - this is your unique secret key
          phrase and file that only you know.   Never  ever write down down
          your pass phrase. Never ever forget it.  Make it  something  very
          complex that you can remember.

       b) create a  "public" key file which OTHER people will use to encode
          messages and files which they  will  send  to you.  You will make
          this key file available to everyone who might need  to send you a
          secure file.

       c) You need  to  receive other PGP user's public keys and store them
          on your key ring.

       d) You will use a person's public  key  to  decode a message or file
          that they have sent you.

       PGP does other fancy things, and I won't get into those.   Below are
       details of the minimum basics:

       a & b)  To  create  your  private  and  public keys, type "PGP -kg".
              Follow the on screen instructions.  Select the military grade
              of encryption from the menu.   Sure,  it will take longer for
              PGP to generate you a military grade encryption  key,  but it
              will be  a  SECURE  key.  If you tire of waiting, then go fix
              yourself a  cup  of  cocoa.    I  like  to  put  those  teeny
              marshmallows in mine.

          You will be asked for your name.  Enter first, middle initial,
          last.  Don't just enter "Bob Smith".  There are going to be
          hundreds, thousands of Bob Smith's out there.  Make it so that

                                      Page 1





          your friend in lower Slobovia who wants to send you a secure
          document can pick you out of a list of many Bob Smiths without
          a lot of guessing.  If you have a net i.d., you can tack the
          i.d. onto the end of your name (pgp will give you an example).

          You will be asked to enter a pass phrase.  Make it long.  Make
          it complex.  Make it something not even your mother could
          guess.  Do NOT make the stupid mistake of using your birth
          place, social security number, date of birth, parents names,
          spouse name or birth date, your kid's names, etc.  DO NOT
          WRITE IT DOWN, EVER. DO NOT STORE IT IN YOUR COMPUTER, EVER.
          You are making it up, so you should be able to make it
          something you can remember. Make it something you will never
          ever forget.  If you forget it, no one can help you.  You will
          be doomed to receive documents and files that you can never
          decrypt and read.  You will be miserable.

          Anyway, from this pass phrase entry work, a public key file
          and a secret key file will be produced.

          Your SECRET key file is NOT to be given to anyone.  Keep it
          secure.  ***** Do not save it in a networked p.c.! *****  Keep
          it on a diskette, which you keep in a very safe place.
          Personally, I hide mine between the plastic wrapped cheese
          slices in my 'fridge - but my wife has gotten used to my
          little idiosyncracies like this.....

          Your public key file will be placed in a file called
          "pubring.pgp". You may copy your public key off of this ring
          to a different file which you may send to your friends.  See
          step "d" below for specifics on this.

          Your secret key file will be put on a secret ring, in a file
          called "secring.pgp".  This is the file that you want to keep
          very secure.

       c) Adding someone's public key to your public key ring:

          Example:

          Bob sends you his public keyfile on a diskette.  You pop the
          diskette into your p.c. and do a dir on the diskette and you
          see a file "bobsmith.pgp". You wish to add this public key to
          your public key ring (pubring.pgp) so that you may encode
          files that you may wish to send Bob.  To add his key to your
          public ring you type:

          "pgp -ka bobsmith.pgp pubring"

          His key will be added to your public key ring.  You may now
          encode files using his public key.  Only Bob Smith will be
          able to decode the file you send him (assuming someone at his
          house has not eaten a bacon, lettuce, tomato, cheese and
          secret diskette sandwich).

          To COPY your public key from your public key ring to a file
          that you send to your friends, type:



                                      Page 2





          "pgp -kx userid keyfile pubring"

          Example:

          You will replace "userid" with your name (remember entering
          your i.d. back in step a?)  You will replace "keyfile" with
          any name which you wish to use for your public key file name.
          My name is Bert Pool, so I logically named my public key file
          "bertpool.pgp".  You can call it anything you want - but I
          already have dibs on "bertpool.pgp".  Make it some name that
          your friends will recognize.

          When I created a copy of my public key which I uploaded to
          Keely Net, I typed:

          pgp -kx "Bert" bertpool.pgp pubring

          A file containing my public key was created, called
          bertpool.pgp.

          Your friends will add your public key to THEIR key rings using
          step c, above.  They will use it to encode messages sent FROM
          THEM TO YOU.  You will use your SECRET key ring and secret
          pass phrase to decode any such files sent to you by your
          friends.

       d) decoding a file sent to you

          Bob sends you an encrypted file called "payroll.pgp".
          Obviously it contains sensitive information (executives get
          real nervous when payroll information might accidently become
          available to the masses), and so it was encrypted with YOUR
          public key.  You run to your fridge, dig through the cheese,
          and ferret out your secret key ring disk, and pop it into your
          p.c. (after wiping off the mustard, of course).

          You type "pgp payroll.pgp -o payroll.txt".  PGP will decrypt
          the encoded file payrollpgp and produce a decoded file called
          payroll.txt.

          PGP comes with a file called PGP.HLP which is a very nice list
          of all the PGP command options.  You probably need to print
          this out and keep it handy for reference, especially if you
          ever need to do one of the upmteen special things that PGP
          does so well.
