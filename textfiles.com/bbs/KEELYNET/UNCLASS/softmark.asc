    Documents Needed

    documentation purposes.  Be sure the source code has a comment or
    remark at the beginning with the title of the software and your
    copyright notice.  See BULLETINS for proper form of copyright notice.

         2.  A printout of the software object code (hexadecimal listing)
    for file documentation purposes.  Be sure the object code includes a
    copyright notice that appears on the initial screen EVERY TIME THE
    SOFTWARE IS RUN.  See BULLETINS for proper form of copyright notice.

         3.  Three (3) special copies of the software for deposit with the
    application.  The guidelines in 1 and 2 immediately above regarding
    copyright notice should be followed, EXCEPT that certain portions of
    the deposit copies may be omitted or be blacked out as described below.

         4.  Documentation for the software.  Be sure the documentation has

    Software Deposit Guidelines
    ---------------------------

         You have three options for making deposits of software with your
    application:

         1.  Deposit the first 25 and last 25 pages of the SOURCE listing.
    If less than 50 pages, then all must be submitted.

         2.  Deposit all the object code under the "rule of doubt."

         3.  Deposit the source and/or object code with portions omitted or
    blacked out, with a special "petition for special relief",as follows:

             (a) Submit the first and last 25 pages of the SOURCE code with
    up to 50% blacked out.

             (b) Submit the first and last 10 pages of the SOURCE code
    with none blacked out.  If less than 20 pages, then all must be
    submitted.

             (c) Submit the first and last 25 pages of the OBJECT code plus
    any 10 or more consecutive pages of the SOURCE CODE.  If the object
    code is less than 50 pages, then all must be submitted.

         Clearly, in any case you would want to do two things: (1) place
    the "meat" of the program in the middle part which may be omitted under
    the guidelines, and (2) double or triple space your source listing.

         RECOMMENDATION:  Option 3 with the option ( a, b, or c) which
    reveals the least amount of sensitive code is usually the best choice.
