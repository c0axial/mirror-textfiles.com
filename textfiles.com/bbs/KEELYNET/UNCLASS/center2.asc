       Dear Ray (Palmer - Editor);

            Your recent  Earth's  "Center  of Gravity" article dealing with
       one aspect of  the  most  baffling   of   scientific   mysteries   -
       gravitation - was most informative.  Any kind of a breakthrough with
       the possible negation or neutralization of gravity  would  result in
       fantastic possibilities.

            With suspended plumb tools NOT pointing DIRECTLY TO the Earth's
       center, one of   the   accepted  PROOFS  of  a  SPHERICAL  EARTH  is
       DISCREDITED.

            Other "PROOFS", many of which  FLYING  SAUCERS  (magazine)  has
       REFUTED, are:

          1)  that the Earth IS circumnavigable
          2)  what really causes the ship's hull to point down
          3)  the Earth's shadow on an eclipsed Moon
          4)  the pole star angle ABOVE the horizon
          5)  high altitude photographs of the Earth's shape
          6)  meteors curve BEHIND the horizon
          7)  and satellites orbit the globe.

            Placing the  center  of  gravity  at Earth's  radius  IN  SPACE
       between the Van  Allen  radiation belt seems like a modified version
       of the old theory of gravity being  a  PUSH of SPACE CHARGES instead
       of a PULL, with the larger sphere of matter HAVING A GREATER RATE OF
       ABSORPTION.

            The exact  site of the French plumb bob tests  is  of  interest
       ESPECIALLY if near  Calumet,  Michigan,  which  has  an  approximate
       latitude of 47  degrees  North.    With   plumb   line  DIVERGENCIES
       theorized as being CAUSED BY GRAVITY VARIATIONS due  to the NEARNESS
       of HIGH DENSITY or MASS, there may be a connection with the Michigan
       tests being located in an iron-ore belt.

            Although gravity  readings  near  mountain masses MANY TIMES DO
       NOT INCREASE as expected, one of  the  highest  gravity  readings in
       recent times has been in mountainous Cyprus.

            A current theory surmises CONTRACTION of the Earth  has  CEASED
       and EXPANSION is NOW TAKING PLACE accompanied with a DECREASE IN THE
       FORCE OF GRAVITY.

            In the  early  twenties  Dr.  Charles F. Brush reported in "The
       Proceedings of the American Philosophical  Society" that experiments
       on gravity demonstrated  that  of  two  pendulums  having  the  SAME
       OSCILLATION LENGTH, a bismuth bob would GAIN ONE BEAT in 17.432 over
       a zinc bob,  with  torsion balances of the SAME MATERIALS HAVING THE
       SAME RESULTS.  (this is what is now  referred (1991) to as the FIFTH
       FORCE - repulsion of matter.....Vangard Sciences)

            Observations also   showed  ANOMALIES  of  CERTAIN   SILICATES,
       particularly Lintz Basalt   (a   German   volcanic   deposit)   with
       accelerations LESS THAN 980 centimeters IN FREE FALL.

            These contradictions to the  accepted  view  were speculated by
       other experimenters to   be  due  to  DIAMAGNETISM   (repellent   to
       magnetism), a temporary   change   in   the  universal  constant  of
       gravitation, or a possible REACTIVE  FORCE  set  up  by  the Earth's
       thick UNDERCRUST OF  BASALT,  although nothing could  be  definitely
       proven.

            A 1960 theory suggests the geomagnetic field takes an ELONGATED
       TEARDROP SHAPE with  the  size  (of  the  teardrop) DEPENDING on the
       STRENGTH OF SOLAR WIND PROTONS, much  in  the  manner of comets with
       their tails STRETCHING AWAY FROM THE SUN.

            The deformed magnetic field boundary FACING THE  SOLAR  WIND is
       considered to extend some 20,000 miles SUNWARD, then bulges twice as
       far ON EITHER  SIDE  OF  THE  EARTH  and  finally TAPERS into a long
       downward tail ON  THE NIGHTTIME SIDE  to  an  unestimated  distance.
       (ergo, a teardrop shape)

            An interesting feature of this hypothesis is that  not only the
       tail but in  the  polar  regions  the magnetic field DOES NOT ROTATE
       WITH THE EARTH, although SOME DISTORTION must take place.

            It seems likely that periodically  the  Earth and Moon magnetic
       fields WOULD OVERLAP.

       Vangard note...

           Refer to  the  work  of  Michael  Faraday,  Bruce   dePalma  and
           Paramahansa Tewari.   Faraday  found that iron filings entrained
           by a magnetic field emanating  from  the  poles of a cylindrical
           magnet WOULD NOT TURN when the magnet was turned.   This  is  an
           anomaly of the first order and a KEY CONCEPT in free energy
           and antigravity research.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

            Previous published  correspondence  on  photographing the Earth
       from a camera-carrying satellite  arouses  interest  in the possible
       maximum Earth coverage from various heights.

            In the table is shown different altitudes, off-vertical viewing
       angles, and the approximate surface distance from  the  vertical  to
       slant range at the horizon, based on 4000 statute miles as the Earth
       radius, and 69.5 miles for each degree of circumference.

            The last  figure  is the 24-hour observation satellite some 5.5
       Earth radii distant all the while hovering over the same meridian.

            A one second degree viewing angle  at the distance of the moon,
       about 10 times  FURTHER than the 24-hour satellite,  would  cover  a
       mile on the surface of the earth.

       Vangard note...

            We have had the distinct pleasure of meeting Mr. Walter Wright,
            THE modern proponent of the PUSH GRAVITY theory which will soon
            be listed on KeelyNet.

            Mr. Wright  has  many proofs and excellent models to verify his
            contentions.  Videotapes  of   his   models  in  operation  are
            excellent and have served to convince many scientists  and  lay
            people of the validity of the PUSH GRAVITY model.

            We refer  you  also  to  the work of Dr. Hans Nieper, listed on
            KeelyNet as TACHYON1 and TACHYON2.
