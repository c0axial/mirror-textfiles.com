There have been unusual effects associated with high voltage or other high
energy fields.  This article coincides with a recent conversation I had with a
fellow at the SSE conference in Austin.  He says there is a researcher who has
discovered a way to not only view the aura (as with Chuck Shrameks AURAVIEW
file) but also to CHANGE the aura under conscious control.

This fellow told me the inventor lives in Missouri and he was about to visit
him.  Not only can you view/alter the aura but he described a device that would
allow you to make a holographic projection of whatever you could project as a
sustained visual image.  The fellow telling me this was not very technical yet
his description involved a chamber containing a gas that was excited by a high
voltage field.  When the subject looked into this excited media and
concentrated on an image from his thoughts, the hologram would appear
proportionate to the intensity and clarity of the thought.  Others too could
see this projection.  We are looking for further information regarding this
phenomenon and researcher and this file is very coincidental as to providing
clues as to how this could be duplicated.

Also, note the similarities to the Hutchinson effect, except that here they
used static machines and not Tesla coils.

                               Electrical Ghosts
                               by Vincent Gaddis

Phantom forms produced by electricity in magnetic fields!  This amazing
phenomenon has been witnessed in several large electrical plants.  The General
Electric Company's Research Laboratory at Schenectady, New York, and an
industrial research laboratory at Freibourg, Germany have issued reports on
this strange occurrence.

In 1930, Chief Engineer Eastman, of the Rhodes Electrical Society in London,
was working on some high-tension wires in a dark room when he saw a luminous
blue sphere form about a revolving dynamo.  In the center of this sphere a
woman's hand suddenly appeared.  Eastman asked his assistant, a Mr. Woodew, if
he could see it, and he replied that he could.  Both men watched the
phenomenon, and they were able to ascertain every detail of the conditions
causing it.

The two men spent four days trying to produce the occurrence again, and when
they succeeded a human head, instead of a hand, appeared.  Photographs were
taken and they were published in several European journals in the summer of
1930.

A follow-up to the Rhodes observation was an article printed in the Revue
Spirite (Paris), written by M. Henri Azam.  M. Azam has obtained his material,
from an experimenter who desired to remain unknown except to the publication's
editors.  This unknown student was quoted as follows:

  "In the pursuit of my specialized work in the occult and psychic fields I
   long desired to find out whether it was possible to reconstitute the astral
   form by means of sound vibrations.  It was my belief that mediumistic
   phenomena, when they are serious in character, are exclusively the result of
   setting in action some force for which the medium is the CONDENSER.  It was
   my purpose, therefore, to reconstitute a sphere of synchronous vibrations
   analogous to those which emanate from the human entity, but to do so without
   the intervention of any medium..."

The following methods were used by the experimenter.  Two machines of static
electricity were arranged so that the plates would turn in opposite directions.
The positions and distance between the plates were so arranged as to be
susceptible to infinite vibration.  As a result there was a variable and
sensitive magnetic (electrostatic) field formed.

A membrane covered with lycompodium powder was placed at the variable point so
that it vibrated according to the electric wave lengths employed.  The
vibrations were intensified by adding the factors of light, sound, and
perfumes.  A magic lantern was directed upon the variable point for light
effects; an organ was used for sound effects.

(these two counter-rotating electrostatic disks must have been on a horizontal
axis to allow the membrane to lie flat for the lycopodium powder....Vangard)

  "Under these conditions on several different occasions I was able to obtain
   the formation of human and animal forms, which appeared in the magnetic
   field.  At first these were only partial, but twice I succeeded in obtaining
   complete forms.  They ALWAYS PRESENTED themselves in the sensitive field and
   near the variable point.  Three photographic negatives, exceedingly clear
   and sharply defined, were obtained of these vibrational forms."

The conclusions of the experimenter are that he has been able to obtain
responding vibrations of the astral or psychic world; that the results cannot
be ascribed to imagination or hallucination; that the forms which appear are
not spirits, but empty and discarded etheric or astral bodies or shells; that
it is therefore possible to obtain psychic phenomena without the aid of human
mediums.

The importance of these observations is obvious.  Once again we have apparently
found a realm in which the physical and astral worlds merge.  Additional
research in this domain of phenomena would be physical, and would not require
the services of a medium.  Nevertheless the ability to form a window or vortex
between two vibratory planes might result.

First of all, what are these forms?  Are they abandoned etheric bodies or
disintegrating thought forms?  Etheric bodies, which are regarded as links
between the physical and astral bodies, are abandoned soon after physical
death, according to the theory, and they slowly disintegrate in a vibratory
plane known as the 'astral cemetery' which lies very close to the vibratory
limits of our visible physical plane.  It is also supposed that these empty
etheric bodies remain close to the decaying physical bodies until they are
dissolved into their original basic elements.  Being held nearby by various
subtle affinities, these etheric shells are said to be the cause of reported
graveyard phantoms.

If this is true, the best place to set up an experimental electric/magnetic
field would be in a cemetery vault or in a building close to a cemetery.  This
is an experiment the writer plans to make when conditions permit.  Positive
results would indicate that these forms, if successfully obtained, are actually
etheric bodies abandoned by progressing astral bodies.

One more thought should be presented; the possibility that natural electric
phenomena may provide conditions for psychic phenomena should not be
overlooked.  There are many reports of phantoms observed DURING ELECTRICAL
STORMS.  Apparent poltergeist activity are often displayed during intense
electrical atmospheric stress.  Ball lightning often exhibits the directions
and actions of apparent intelligence.

For example, the late Charles F. Talman, government meteorologist, in an
article in Readers Digest, June 1935, tells of a ball of lightning entering an
open window, travelling about the room as if exploring it, then finally
departing by the window it has entered.

More amazing cases will be found in Flammarion's work, THE PRANKS OF LIGHTNING.
In all of these occurrences tricks of a poltergeist nature were performed,
under conditions indicating the possibility of a directing intelligence.  The
writer feels certain that in this phenomena of electrical ghosts we may have a
key that will unlock many mysteries of the psychic world.

(In a personal letter, circa 1946, to Meade Layne we find the further related
remarks of Mr. Gaddis: "The relationship between storms and psychic
observations is a vast field in itself.  A neighbor of mine, recently deceased,
once told me of seeing a number of phantoms during an electrical storm when he
was caught in a local cemetery.  They were simply white human-like forms
hovering above the grave, glimpsed during flashes of lightning.")

        co-authoring a book with Nancy Bradley titled GOLD RUSH GHOSTS.]

Clips, Quotes & Comments by Tom Brown

This article of veteran Borderland researcher Vincent Gaddis has been an
interest of mine for several years.  The work of M. Azam certainly brings to
mind the high-frequency researches of Carl Wickland with his huge electrostatic
Wimshurst machine.

In working with Eric Dollard around various high-frequency electrical apparatus
I have observed many organic and mysterious forms appearing in gas plasmas and
in free space discharges.  The plasmas have provided the most interesting views
across the borderlands and we have observed human, animal and plant forms as
well as microscopic (amoeba, etc.) and macroscopic (fireball/stars, galactic
formations).  From direct experience in the lab I have seen that in Vince's
article resides an important key.

The eminent scientist and spiritualist Sir William Crookes studied the forms
appearing in high frequency plasmas approximately a century ago.  He felt that
in this manner of experimentation one could find the true borderland between
the physical and the spiritual.  In Ernst Lehr's MAN OR MATTER this matter is
discussed in a quite lucid manner and one is brought to the understanding that
there certainly is a "country" beyond the borderlands of this nature, but it is
not the "country" we seek for a true spiritual understanding of the
manifestation we are an integral part of.

"When William Crookes chose as one of the titles of his paper on the newly
discovered properties of electricity, 'The Fourth State of Matter', it was to
express his belief that he had found a state of matter, additional to the three
known ones, which represented the 'borderland where matter and force seem to
merge into one another, the shadowy realm between known and unknown' for which
his soul had been longing ever since the death of his beloved brother.  All
that has followed from his discovery, down to the transformation of matter
itself into freely working energy, shows that he was right in thinking he had
reached some borderland of nature.  Only the country into which this borderland
leads is not the one he had really been looking for."  Ernst Lehrs, MAN OR
MATTER, (C) 1958,  Rudolph Steiner Press, London.

The "country" which we seek across the Borderlands is the one which contains
the cosmic archetypes from which all life springs.  The high frequency
researches of Eric Dollard have helped put electricity into a proper
perspective with the etheric realms and we can see how science has mistakenly
plunged into the SUB-sensible realms rather than the SUPER-sensible which draws
one to more refined levels of comprehension.  Spirituality, following the
general gravity-bound tendency of our materialistic society in general, has
also mistakenly plunged into the SUB-sensible realms through attachment to the
egos of the channelled entities.  How much better it would be for spiritual
researchers to 'cross the borderlands TO THE SUPER-sensible through an awakened
perception of nature and development of the intuition rather than by relying on
mere belief in the words of discarnate entities.

I have found through studying Goethe's indications on the phenomenon of Light
and Color in conjunction with Eric Dollard's high frequency researches that
electricity is a reflection of the Light Ether.  It is sufficient for present
reference to say that Light has its two poles, red-yellow and blue-violet.  The
red-yellow pole in nature is longitudinal (direct rays from sun) and the blue-
violet pole is a progressive type of transverse wave (rounded sky, Reich's KRW
wave/blue orgone).

Electricity has its two poles, electro-magnetism: red-yellow-hot, (retarded
transverse); and dielectricity: blue-violet-cold (longitudinal).  Hence, there
are experimental indications that electricity truly is a reflection of the
Light Ether.

With proper understanding and orientation of the etheric and electrical fields
many workable concepts may emerge.  For example the use of plasma detector
tubes around a Lakhovsky Multiple Wave Oscillator will provide many clues to
the etheric output of that device.  The relationship of electricity to the
evolving human soul is a prime area of interest at BSRF and is an open area of
discussion in this Journal.  Members are encouraged to send in their views on
this most interesting subject.

Vangard Note

   We should keep in mind certain phenomena associated with Chladni vibrating
   waveplates.  In a film done by the late Hans Jenny, lycopodium powder is
   placed on a flexible membrane and driven by sound waves of various
   frequencies, phases and intensities.  A DRAGONFLY is clearly formed with the
   proper frequency combinations and another shows the reticulation of a snake
   backbone and how it crawls across the surface.  All this is done with sound
   ALONE.  Until a much better understanding of how various frequencies can be
   so compounded as to mimic structure and movement, it would be prudent to
   refrain from claiming astral bodies as the cause of the figures.  This is
   however, an open opportunity for investigation by anyone who might wish to
   pursue it.  As usual, we would appreciate any feedback if you decide to
   carry out research in this area or find other correlations.
