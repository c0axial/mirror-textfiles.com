            Vanguard Sciences / KeelyNet Newsletter / January 1995
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greetings!  This is the first 'issue' representing a different way of
information exchange with our friends, supporters and associates.  Based on
observations and comments over the past year, it appears the activities of
those of us here in Dallas and on the KeelyNet BBS are not known to many who
should at the very least be kept abreast of what many of us are looking into.
You will note the sparse simplicity of this first mailer, because I am
following a K.I.S.S. format (keep it simple stupid).  Over this next year,
various alternative science publications will be presented with interesting
files from our group that might wind up in their newsletters for their own
subscribers.  In case you are unaware of what the KeelyNet BBS represents, it
is an absolutely FREE computer bulletin board dedicated to the study of
alternative science subjects.  We have almost 1500 users from around the
world, will have been online for 6 years in July 95' and have received around
35,000 calls.  At present we get about 30 calls PER DAY or more and have what
is described as an 'active' e-mail area.  We welcome your participation if you
have access to a computer and a modem.  The general settings are 8N1, the
system can handle up to 14.4bps and is 24 hours, 7 days per week at (214) 324-
3501.  Any computer will work with KeelyNet, even MACs...<g>...

Beginning this month, the mailer is being sent out all over the country and to
our friends in other countries; even though the original intent was as a
reminder and agenda-setter for our monthly Roundtable meetings here in the
Dallas area.  A group of interested people and researchers meet the third
Thursday OF EACH MONTH at the JoJo's restaurant at Midway and LBJ in Dallas.
The meetings begin at 7PM and last til about 10PM.  Some of us remain after
the 'formal' meeting to discuss more detailed aspects.  Should you happen to
be in the Metroplex during this period, please feel free to drop by.  If you
wish you can 'warn' me by voice at (214) 324-8741.  We generally eat a meal,
though it's not required, present information brought to share with the group,
discuss various subjects, show machines when available, show interesting video
segments, never exceeding one hour and sometimes have a 'surprise' speaker for
a short presentation.  It is great fun, informative and full of surprises.

Norman Wootan, Joel McClain and Bert Pool have kindly provided interesting
hardware as demonstration units over the past two years of these meetings.  As
most of us agree, there is nothing more positive and thought provoking than
working hardware to backup a claim or hypothesis.  And for additional
'outside' information, Cheyenne Turner, Leonard Dorsett, Jack Veach and
various other friends have brought interesting people from as far away as
England and Canada to these meetings, all of whom have shared good information
with us.  Not to mention the various audio/video tapes, flyers and books
loaned by Ed and Mary, Ron and Kay, Howard and Joanne, Dan, Hans and dozens of
others who have a sincere interest in helping to bring to reality an advanced
understanding in multiple unorthodox areas.  We are truly fortunate to have
such high quality people concentrated in the Metroplex area and who are so
enthusiastic in their sharing of fascinating and hard to find information.

The general tone of these mailers will be as a chatty kind of newsletter, with
as much detail and contact information as possible.  I figure since these are
being mailed every month anyway, Why not simply expand it globally?  If you
are interested in a specific topic described in these papers, you can pursue
it by calls, mail or through KeelyNet contact.  We would appreciate anything
you might wish to share with our Roundtable group, through the Vanguard
Sciences/KeelyNet mailing address or through the KeelyNet as a file upload,
though in no way is ANYTHING expected or requested...the bottomline, we want
YOU to know WHAT WE KNOW and where we are heading for this month.

David Hudson and his production of Manna
----------------------------------------
About three Roundtables ago (sounds like an Indian time keeping-system...<g>),
we heard of a fellow named David Hudson who had been working on some really
advanced metallurgical and biological research.  One of our associates, Dan,
had been out to visit David and gave us a very basic rundown on what was going
on.  Back in November, Ed gave me an audio tape of a presentation made by
David Hudson at Dean Stonier's fabulous and familial Global Sciences Congress,
held on the lower East coast around February and always in Denver about the
15th of August.  Dean can be contacted by phone at (303) 452-9300 or written
to at Global Sciences, 3273 E.  119th Place, Thornton, CO, ask for a
conference mailer.  His meetings run about 5 days, has around 500 people and
they are all so friendly, much like an extended family.  You will enjoy the
time, make lots of new friends and learn lots of new information.

Anyway, it turns out there are about 3 tapes, ranging from the scientific to
links with biology, healing, alchemy and Kabalah.  The essence of his work is
based on a material called 'ghost gold'.  Using a spectral analysis technique
developed at the Soviet Academy of Sciences, David found what he believes is
the manna of the Hebrews.  The manna is derived from gold and shows an
interrelationship of the precious elements to each other and how they nest,
one within the other, like an onion that is peeled, layer by layer, to expose
ever more rare and precious elements.

Since spectral analysis uses vaporization from electrically created high
temperatures, you can only peel away one element AT A TIME.  As the
temperature gets hotter, it will melt away each element when it reaches the
boiling temperature of THAT element.  Using the Soviet technique, David found
that a specimen of commercial gold contains only 15% actual gold, the other
85% is composed of other precious elements, layered according to their boiling
points.

Gold produced in this fashion takes on the form of a white powder which has
proven to be superconducting.  Massive searches in historical and alchemical
literature indicate it is the same substance sought by alchemists through the
ages and provided as protection to the high priests who guarded the Ark of the
Covenant.  David found information showing this powder to be a 'food' for the
spirit.  Because it is superconducting, it is believed to carry light directly
to the cells, where it is said to correct damage to the DNA and heal the body.

The research and subsequent discoveries detailed were so amazing, that I
transcribed the technical audio tape to text and placed it on KeelyNet as
HUDSON1.ASC should you wish to download it.  The file prints out as about 15
pages of text.  David will speak in Dallas for Cheyennes' Eclectic Viewpoint
in the 2nd week of February.  There will be a presentation, followed the next
day by a workshop.  You can call or FAX her at (214) 424-5855 for exact times
and dates.  If you want a copy of the audio tapes or VIDEOS from Dean's
meetings, you can order them from Global Sciences at the above address.  David
will also speak and present a workshop to the Global Sciences group on March
7th and 8th.  Get this validated through Dean.

Patrick Flanagan links up to KeelyNet
-------------------------------------
Last night, (01/10), I was on the phone with a friend and happened to see
someone named Flanagan, from Sedona, AZ on KeelyNet.  Just out of curiosity, I
checked the activity log of this user, thinking it was probably someone using
Flanagan's name.  The nature of the downloads was such that it indicated the
presence of the REAL Patrick Flanagan.  I called and left a note on their

 Vanguard Sciences / KeelyNet  *  PO BOX 870716  *  Mesquite, TX  *  75187 USA
Vortex Industries answering machine.  About 9PM, I received a call from the
man himself.  We ended up talking for over 3 hours!!!  Needless to say, he is
just as fascinating and full of information today as he was 20 years ago.  It
turns out Patrick comes to Texas periodically and he has promised to call so
we can get together, perhaps even at a future Roundtable meeting.  I heard
Patrick had been nominated by several people to the Nobel Committee for his
outstanding discoveries with COLLOIDS and water.  We discussed a raft of
topics, the Neurophone, water, heavy water, aging, levitation, free energy,
the Incunabula files (dealing with 'travel cults' people who use a device
called an Egg to travel to parallel Earths), the Boese motor (a nitrogen car
that is totally non-polluting), the Garrett Water Carburetor, the 200 year
battery regeneration system (which particularly fascinated Patrick, he had
seen the Bourgeois video from Missouri where the fellow powers his entire
house with a battery pack recharged with a diesel engine), etc., etc...

Patrick and Gael Flanagan live in a secluded section of the Arizona
countryside and vigorously defend their privacy.  They refer to themselves
jokingly as 'Techno-Monks' because of their natural, 'cloistered' lifestyle.
He says they mostly communicate with the outside world via telephone and
computer.  Ah, what a life!

For those who are still not online, Patrick was the guest of honor on the
CompuServe system where he was speaking LIVE with thousands of people online
across the world.  Those messages are available in two text files on KeelyNet
as FLAN1.ASC and FLAN2.ASC.  With regard to my questions about the Neurophone
and rumored experiments of group telepathy, Patrick says he designed a machine
that would connect 30 people at the same time.  He then found a way to entrain
their nervous systems so they would all resonate at the same frequency, thus
enhancing communication as Tom Bearden talks about in his book, 'The Excalibur
Briefing'.

Patrick found that the nervous system vibrates between 50 and 100 thousand
cycles per second, though he says he has successfully transmitted information
as low as 30Khz and as high as 10Mhz (million cycles per second).  He did not
specify the nature of the phenomena encountered but we will no doubt find out
more as we continue to interact in future.  Patrick graciously offered to
update us on his activities and hopefully we will generate some new
informative and practical files.  I am sending them a complete set of KeelyNet
files so they can see the nature of what we are interested in and actually
studying, and hope to meet with the Flanagans when they breeze through Dallas.
One interesting point, we were discussing the abundance of heavy water in our
environment and how we absorb about 1 drop of heavy water (D2O) for every 6000
drops of light water (H2O).

Patrick said heavy water freezes at a higher temperature than light water and
that for several years he drank water derived from an interesting process.
Since heavy water is intermixed with light water, yet freezes at higher
temperature, then a container of water, subjected to freezing temperatures
would freeze from the outside in.  When the water was frozen, the purest water
would be in the center of the container, which was extracted as an ice core
and later consumed.  I definitely look forward to future exchanges of
information with the Flanagans!

The Farrow Weight Negation Box
------------------------------
In the early part of this century, Edward Farrow developed an electrical
device that would reduce the weight of any mass placed UNDER IT!  This device
was demonstrated to the United States government AND TESTED.  There are two

 Vanguard Sciences / KeelyNet  *  PO BOX 870716  *  Mesquite, TX  *  75187 USA
pictures of this box sitting on a scale and showing a weight loss of 3 ounces
from an 18 pound weight when the box is energized.  In the original scans sent
to us by one of our KeelyNetters, we had only limited information and I
assumed from the text and the picture that the box was floating above the
scale.  I had been in contact with a fellow from Florida who had been using
an amazing psychic to locate and dig up treasure hoards from sunken ships, he
claimed he had given a copy of the Farrow story to this psychic.  The psychic
said he could see a box in an attic and named a particular city.  My contact
called and found a family who in fact turned out to be Farrow's descendents.
They said one of their uncles was an eccentric inventor and yes, there were
some odd things in their attic.

My contact flew up there (around New York I suspect because that was Farrow's
stomping grounds) and had arranged to X-ray the mystery box to see what was
inside.  When he got there, he says not only was the box present but also a
document describing how the device was constructed and how it worked.  He
managed to purchase the box and associated materials for a few thousand
dollars.  Of course, he has refrained from providing any data, but says he
will do so in the future after he has analyzed the box and documented the
effect in modern times.  This man also had detailed information on Edward
Leeskalnin's Coral Castle construction at Homestead, Florida.  He says there
was a network of suspended wires OVER the Coral Castle facility before the
establishment of the military base and which were taken down when the base was
built.

About three weeks ago, I got a thin brown envelope from this contact.  When I
opened it, there were three items, an article by Seike on a gravity craft, a
patent cover for a Schauberger turbine and an article about the Farrow device.
As I began to read the Farrow paper, I noticed increasingly larger areas in
the text which were GONE, they had been WHITED OUT!!!  At this time, I have no
idea WHY this fellow would do this but he made several small and one very
large mistake.  I or one of our Associates WILL dig up this paper and it WILL
be networked and FREELY SHARED.

Now for the good stuff.  The paper says Farrow used an 18 ounce book placed on
a scale to show the weight.  Farrow called his device a 'condensing dynamo'
and said electrical components could be used to control not only electricity
but also gravity.  When this box was placed on top of the book and energized,
the book lost 3 ounces of weight as shown by the 15 ounce value on the scale.

If you are reading this, you are probably advanced enough to know that gravity
is NOT a suction/pull but a PUSH as the aether densities of space FLOW INTO
the neutral center of all the components of the mass aggregate, proportional
to their volume and character. Contact Walter Wright, 732 Ohio St., Fairfield,
CA 94533 (707) 429-0598 for detailed experiments and information on the PUSH
GRAVITY theory.  Walter is a great friend who has spent tens of thousands of
his own money and countless hours working on the Push Gravity theory.  He has
tried to educate a deaf academia and sympathetic general public to the true
nature of gravity.  NO ONE has accepted his challenges where he will PROVE
that gravity is a PULL and NOT a push.  Walter has developed over 100
experiments using repelling magnets to emulate the PUSH effect.  He has an
excellent book, 'Gravity is a Push' and a series of marvelous videotapes that
will change YOUR way of thinking about gravity.

Since the box is placed OVER the book to achieve the weight reduction, it
follows that if the box was placed UNDER the book, nothing would happen,
because we are HELD TO THE PLANET (and together) by the inflowing aether.  The
energized box PARTIALLY SHIELDS the book from the INCOMING FLOW of aether and

 Vanguard Sciences / KeelyNet  *  PO BOX 870716  *  Mesquite, TX  *  75187 USA
all its spectrum WHICH INCLUDES GRAVITY (see NEUTRAL1.ASC on KeelyNet).
Farrow says the box projects a thin, circular disk of energy outward from the
center of the box.  This disk has a circumference of about 1 mile.  Please
note, a helicopter hovering over the ground is being supported on a 'cone' of
air that distributes the weight of the helicopter OVER A WIDE AREA.  If you
happen to be within that 'air cone', you then are helping to support the
helicopter to remain in the air.  This is EXACTLY what happens with the Farrow
box, and some of us suspect many other 'weight reducing/levitation' machines
use this exact principle.

The gravity that would normally flow into and through the mass is now being
DISPERSED over a wide area.  This 'disk' acts as a porous umbrella to redirect
the flow of aether FROM the mass center to the mass centers of other
aggregates.  You are aware of the magnetic and electrical anomalies associated
with UFOs, sometimes before they ever appear.  In fact, there are magnetic
detection circuits that allow you to pick up the presence of a UFO while it is
yet a distance away.  Why?  Because IT TOO is FLOATING as it distributes its
weight over a wide area.  If it is a simple weight decrease, then the inertia
is proportional to the amount of 'aether' that flows into the mass aggregate
neutral centers.  So levitation would cause the craft to counteract the flow
of the aether and thus BE WITHOUT INERTIA!

Other properties of this inertialless field would be to slow down or stop
AGING of the body or the natural decay of matter.  Note the UFO contact cases
where the alien looks to be approximately 25 years of age.  When asked how old
they are, they say 1000 years or so and that they achieve this only as long as
they stay WITHIN THE FIELD of their ship.  If they too long stay under the
influence of a planetary aether flow, they resume aging, not a Dorian Gray,
flesh to powder situation, but simply a resumption of the aging process.

The study of the aether never ceases to be fascinating.  One of the claims of
relativity is that time slows down in space.  Keely long ago said 'Time IS
Gravity.'  The alternative explanation for why time slows down in open space
is that gravity/aether is present but to a greatly reduced degree.  The closer
you get to a large body, the more aether is attracted INTO the neutral centers
of that mass and so gravity and it's 'pull' comes into play.  In fact, were
you in a ship near such a body, you would be caught in the 'aether wind' that
is flowing from the AETHER DENSE space background INTO THAT BODY.  This simple
fact is a sure indication of a TRUE free energy machine, because tapping the
aether will produce not only overunity, but also time distortions AS A
BYPRODUCT of the NECESSARILY reduced gravity.

For those who haven't heard of it, Hal Puthoff, Bernard Haische and another
fellow wrote a magnificent paper last year, hypothesizing that ZPE was the
CAUSE of inertia.  We still don't have a copy of the paper but will place it
online WHEN WE GET IT, thank you Hal!  Think of swimming in the water or
moving through it relatively fast, when you stop, the 'entrained' water that
has been flowing behind you DUE TO TURBULENCE (read interference), and which
will CONTINUE to flow AGAINST YOU until it matches the ambient velocities by
blending into and dissipating this interference INDUCED 'inertial flow'.

Electrostatic Force Fields
--------------------------
I was given a copy of a book called 'Spontaneous Human Combustion' by Jenny
Randles and Peter Hough.  Although I had seen it many times, I did not think
there would be anything of use because I had done some serious study of the
phenomenon and 'knew most of it'. For some reason, Cheyenne seems to know that
I need something though never WHY that is so.  She does persist despite my not

 Vanguard Sciences / KeelyNet  *  PO BOX 870716  *  Mesquite, TX  *  75187 USA
wanting to read it until I finally do and bang, something useful pops out.
In this book, there is a chapter called 'May the Force be With You'.  It dealt
with strange natural energies which seemed to generate force fields.  I
studied the entire book, but this is the specific section that 'clicked'.  It
ended up as a file on KeelyNet called FORCEFLD.ASC which, using specific
information gleaned from actual cases, seems to indicate that an intense
electrostatic field can cause the electronic bonds of air molecules to attract
each other to a degree proportional to the intensity of the excitation field.

Nature is thus producing some kind of electrostatic field that manifests
through a vortex motion, hissing and cracking, producing a cobweb effect on
the skin, with a smell of ozone and other phenomena associated with high
voltage.  In one case, two girls were trapped INSIDE of one of these
forcefields and complained of how hard it was to breathe until they forcibly
broke out of the field.  It is known that ions can displace oxygen, but in
this case, it is more likely the air molecules are so tightly bonded together
that inhalation would be akin to scuba diving at 100 or more feet below the
surface of the water.  In scuba diving, you experience labored breathing
because the tanked air is under much higher pressures when under such a great
body of water.  In the high density electrostatic coupling of the air
molecules, it would be almost exactly the same as diving at this level, if not
more difficult.  From this, I think it is quite possible to generate a field
of force, of adjustable resistance, which in reality would force the air
molecules to more tightly connect.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slim & Gene Sperling
--------------------

Some of us met with a couple from Denver, Slim and Gene, both of whom are
researchers into and practitioners of GeoBiology.  They use Moebius, caduceus
and bifilar coils to produce polarized fields to influence matter.  Gene
showed us several coils or wires that are twisted to form a bifilar wire where
both ends of the wire are connected by a hollow sphere.  This sphere is called
an 'amplifier' and was likened to an air-gap capacitor.  Slim said they could
influence the weather by placing a version of these specially wound coils
between THREE speakers.  A series of tones are then played into the coil and
indications are that various field energies of the local environment are
affected by some mysterious emission.  At first, I did not have much
confidence in this because there was no way to qualitatively measure it.

Gene says they use biological detectors such as plants and cultures.  Slim
later produced a notebook with measurements taken from Bob Dratch's subtle
energy microwave analyzer.  They showed a definite COHERING OF THE BACKGROUND
CHAOS when the coil device was stimulated.  A further set of measurements were
made using Bill Ramseys' gravity wave detector.  Bill's circuit is basically
the Hodowanec 741 op amp in an unstable oscillator mode.  The many random
frequencies, when charted, show as a very noisy trace.  When some strong
signal comes into play, it entrains the 741 oscillator and produces a clean
waveform DRIVEN by the biasing field energy, thus detecting what can not be
otherwise detected.  If you want info on how to wind or create such coils,
check out the image file COILS.GIF on KeelyNet.

There two groups who have contacted us with reports of their experiments in
this area and Dan Davidson told us of a group of researchers he knew of out in
California, who were using a caduceus coil as an antenna to radiate the
'general tonic' Rife frequency.  They were observing live blood under a high
power microscope while transmitting the Rife frequency  through the caduceus.
The blood cells were exploding as they watched.  When they realized that it

 Vanguard Sciences / KeelyNet  *  PO BOX 870716  *  Mesquite, TX  *  75187 USA
must be happening in their bodies ALSO, they shut down the experiment.
Patrick Flanagan also has an excellent booklet on this subject called
'Magnetic Topology'.  In this booklet, Patrick recounts many of his early
experiments with stressed materials and scalar type coils.

Fish Hook Healing technique
---------------------------

Our Quality Control manager at work said he'd seen an episode of 'Connections'
on cable TV.  They showed people with various illnesses, with 100's of
fishhooks snagged in their backs.  These people were suspended from the
ceiling by these fishhooks and their skin stretched to support their full body
weight.  Jerry (the QC manager) said the people were thus suspended for
several hours.  When they were taken down, the fishhooks were removed and they
were cured of their illness.  The wounds from the 100's of fishhooks healed
within minutes.  The people said this did not hurt and were willing to undergo
this drastic procedure in order to heal themselves.  Has anyone heard of this
and if it is true, what is the healing mechanism invoked?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Device showing the Theory of Magnetic Instability
-------------------------------------------------

A lady KeelyNetter sent up a fascinating file describing how to build a
magnetic device that powers itself.  It consists of disc magnets you can get
from Radio Shack, placed together and taped to stay in a roll much like a roll
of Lifesavers.  A wooden shaft is run down the center of this magnet roll and
attached to two 1.5" Tinkertoy wheels.  The inventor tells me this is to SLOW
DOWN the speed of the wheel.  Two ramps are constructed, each consisting of an
incline and a decline.  Four more magnet rolls are built up.  One of these is
placed along each edge of the incline.

When the tinkertoy roller is placed at the base of the first incline, it rolls
all by itself up to the top, then down the decline, then back up and down the
other ramp.  I called the inventor and he said he'd invented this and tried to
patent it back in 1978.  The Patent Office said it was perpetual motion and
thus impossible to do despite the working model.  They declined his patent.
Shortly after, a Dr. Marion Blackmon flew from Washington to the inventors
home and was amazed by the device.  He promised to stir up interest in
Washington.  After a few months of not hearing from this scientist, the
inventor checked with the Patent office and they could find no trace of his
application or correspondence.  A couple of months after this, someone broke
into his home and removed all his original documents and designs.  He decided
to not pursue the matter because of all this cloak and dagger action.

Now, almost 20 years later, he feels it needs to again be tested and
developed.  The file on KeelyNet for this is TMIDEVIC.ASC should you wish to
download it.  I am also sending photo copies of the document to our other
active networkers to pass on to their people.  I believe this is the secret of
the Searl Ring, a circular track which Searl used to demonstrate his roller
magnet ideas.  He would place a track with peaks and valleys on it on a flat
table.  A special 'roller magnet' was placed on the track and it would roll up
and down all around the track and continue, all the while increasing in speed.
The inventor of the TMIDEVIC thinks a magnet can be fixed inside a moveable
wheel.  On the inside rim of this wheel would be these inclines and declines.
As the magnetic field intercepted the ramps, the wheel would revolve and
possibly do useful work.  Neodymium magnets would further enhance the power of
this unit..................seeya at the meeting!..............>>>
