Following was an interesting followup message on another bbs concerning
the Nasca monkey file....  (MONKEY1.ASC is the original file)

I found your postings on this subject absolutely fascinating!  Tragically,
however (screams of help!), I only received up to the fourth posting.  I didn't
get the rest of it.  Any way you could send it to me, or repost?  Anybody else
miss it?  I don't profess to know anything about the geometrical aspects of it,
but I wanted to share the following with you, in case you're not aware of it.
.
The pentagram, and the number five were not only sacred to the alchemists, or
the Pythagoreans.  The number five was always, even back to the Qabala.  The
number five symbolizes knowledge, and this is why the apple was chosen in the
bible to represent the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil of which Adam
and Eve partook: the core of the apple, when dissected, is always in the shape
of the pentagon.

 JM> Precision Grip
 JM>
 JM> We find that in three cases the Monkey aligns its fingertips in
 JM> pairs to the X-Star directions, while grasping, or strumming
 JM> the circle around the Monkey Star like a string. It looks like
 JM> the Monkey holds the circle between its thumb and index digits.
 JM> We also find the rest of the hands' design to be similarly
 JM> deliberate and precise in its many other aspects.
 JM> Such dexterity in hands and fingers is normally limited to
 JM> humans and higher primates. The hold between the thumb and the
 JM> index finger is known as the Precision Grip.
 JM> But the Americas were ever inhabited only by such lower primate
 JM> species, which lack the elongated thumb opposable to the other
 JM> fingers on the same hand, i.e., they lack the Precision Grip.
 JM>
 JM> In general, the Monkey is not seen as Anthropomorphic. Yet, it
 JM> has very capable hands with sensitive fingertips essential to
 JM> the Precision Grip, and so, in the absence of a local simian
 JM> model, we have to choose between anthropomorphism, or a non-
 JM> American model for the Monkey.

Carl Jung studied native cultures around the world, and discovered that
most of the subconscious, archetypal images were similar from culture to
culture.  I wonder if the following could have some possible relation to
what you are writing about.
.
In his book "Dream Symbolism in Relation to Alchemy", Jung writes of this
dream: "Many people are present.  They are all walking to the left around
a square.  The dreamer is not in the centre but to one side.  They say that
a gibbon is to be reconstructed."  Let me quote you the definition of gibbon
from my dictionary; any of several small, slender, long-armed arboreal
anthropoid apes of the genus Hylobates of the East Indies and Southern
Asia."  Not at all like the ape you described.  And yet, if the ape is
such an integral, recurring subconscious symbol, would it not be appropriate
to subscribe human characteristics.
.
In mythology, the dog-headed baboon Hermes-Thoth was, along with another
God Hermes Trismegistus  eventually combined to become Mercury; the God
of knowledge and communication (associated with the number five).  Thoth
had an encyclopedic memory, having written most of the great treatises on
magic, as well as mathematics, astronomy and astrology.
.
Jung says of this "highest among the apes known to the Egyptians...that its
godlike affinities make it an equally appropriate symbol for that part of
the unconscious which transcends the conscious level."  He also states:
"The assumption that the human psyche possesses layers that lie below
consciousness is not likely to arouse serious opposition.

But that there could just as well be layers lying above the consciousness seems
to be a surmise which borders on a crimen laesae majestatis humanae, (sorry I
don't translate latin).  In my experience the conscious mind can claim only a
relatively central position and must accept the fact that the unconscious
psyche transcends and as it were surrounds it on all sides.  Unconscious
contents connect it backwards with physiological states on the one hand and
archetypal data on the other.  But it is extended forwards by intuitions which
are determined partly by archetypes and partly by subliminal perceptions
depending on the relativity of time and space in the unconscious."
.
Seems to me like whomever encoded that message inside of an ape may have
had good reason to.  Could this be an encoded message about our own
evolution?

David Dean had some very interesting insights into this structure,
and I felt both Joel and Gerald would find these of interest.....> Bert
