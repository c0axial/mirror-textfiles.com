         The following was inspired by a dream I had around 12/01/94.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Several years ago, there was a movement in the State of Texas to SECEDE from
the United States.  It is a guaranteed right in the Texas State Constitution
that Texas CAN SECEDE from the Union if a sufficient number of TEXANS vote to
do so.  You used to see a SECEDE TEXAS bumper sticker every now and then, but
the movement failed because so many are content with the status quo.  Times
have changed.  We need to promote and accelerate such a movement to get us
away from the ever eroding Federal system.

I can't recall how it all came about, but in the dream, a movement was started
that resulted in a vast meeting held in Dallas.  That meeting was a major
rally where everyone voted for Texas to secede from the United States and
become an independent country.  Many Texans came to realize that the United
States was misdirected and badly governed, that WE COULD BEST DECIDE how to
run our own government LOCALLY, without having our tax money spread all over
the country, supporting projects that DID NOT CONCERN or BENEFIT us in the
LEAST.

The Federal government, using OUR MONEY, pays for welfare, health care, social
security along with multi-billions of OUR dollars GIVEN to other countries and
people in other states or parts of the world, and which do NOTHING for US here
in Texas.

In the dream, once the secession was a reality and TEXAS was now a COUNTRY in
its own right, a majority vote of TEXANS elected Henry Cisneros as the 1st
President of the Country of Texas.  There was a major outdoor celebration in
the form of a Barbecue luncheon where tens of thousands of people attended to
meet and hear Cisneros giving his 'Inauguration speech'.

At that meeting, I was introduced to President Cisneros as representing a bank
of information and researchers who would put Texas far ahead of current
science, if they were given a chance.  The universities and formal
institutions were having fits because to their limited way of thinking, we all
represented the 'flakier' aspects of science.  Yet Cisneros was of the opinion
that if ONLY ONE of our technologies could be brought to reality, it would
ensure Texas economic supremacy for many years, thereby solidifying us as a
Country to be reckoned with on a global playing field.  To that end, Cisneros
created a special branch of the government devoted exclusively to our research
interests and protected from interference by vested parties.

I have no earthly idea what triggered this dream but it seems to have some
deeper meaning.  Since it happened, I keep going back to it, looking at why it
keeps 'sticking' in my mind.  So, in the spirit of 'thought-groups', I decided
to write up some thoughts on the matter in order to promote the idea.

To the best of my knowledge, Texas is the ONLY state in the Union with a
provision in the State Constitution that would allow us to SECEDE from the
United States.  The founding fathers of Texas were far wiser than we give them
credit for by foreseeing a possible future use for such a provision.

The RIGHT TO SECEDE is brilliant provision!

It provided future generations of TEXANS an ESCAPE from a bloated, confused
and overbearing Federal system should the United States degrade to an
unacceptable set of conditions.  When a majority of Texans became dissatisfied
with how we were being controlled or manipulated by a Federal Bureaucracy
which had lost touch with the citizens WHO SUSTAIN IT, we could simply walk
away from it all, step out of the Federal system and take care of our OWN
DESTINY.

Secession makes perfect sense.  I have no problems whatsoever with spending
taxes that I KNOW will be applied TO MY STATE, COUNTY OR CITY, translate that
to MY STOMPING GROUNDS!  Not to New York, California or BF Egypt!  But when my
tax money is being pooled 'for the good' of the greater United States, it is
much too tempting for politicians and others to dip into those funds for their
own projects and ideas of what they think best.

Everyone complains about the IRS, welfare, social security, large money gifts
to foreign countries and laws that direct and control us in ever-increasing
aspects of our lives, yet NOTHING CAN BE DONE because so many are afraid to
take actions.  These actions would be to simply NOT pay the IRS EN MASSE. Too
many have too much to lose and don't want to risk it without the GUARANTEE the
majority of their peers would also participate.  We in Texas have an OUT!

Federal Laws apply to schooling, raising children, doing business, hiring
people, FIRING people, welfare, ever growing FEDERALLY directed taxes, etc..
Such laws are NONE OF THE BUSINESS of a CENTRAL government trying to CONTROL
so many different states and so many millions of diverse people and cultures.
That is not what the US Constitution originally provided for and things are so
bloated at this date, WE CAN NEVER CHANGE IT.  It must die of its own inertia!

As for TEXANS, we have the ultimate OUT!  S-E-C-E-S-S-I-O-N !

The Federal System does not consider local situations or views and therefore
are totally out of touch with the reality of LOCAL environments.  We should
determine what laws and what taxes WE LIVE UNDER IN OUR OWN STATE. This will
never happen as long as we live within the dominion of the Federal System.
Our only SURE escape, for TEXANS, is to SECEDE and form our own COUNTRY with
our own laws, taxes and infrastructure!

On discussing this with various folks, it was pointed out that we might lose
some of our 'citizens' when they could no longer get welfare FREELY from a
Federal government.  This is an excellent idea, it would cause the free
loaders and loafers to GO WHERE THE GRAVY and EASY LIFE were freely provided
at the expense of the producers and taxpayers!  Outside the Country of Texas!
Either LEAVE the Country of TEXAS or get off your butt, straighten out your
life and be a responsible, productive citizen!  When meeting new people, we
Texans can then say, I'm from Texas, what COUNTRY ARE YOU FROM?

Texans would now be in control of their environment and society to the point
that we can make changes WITHOUT the blessing or authorization of a larger,
confused and ill-governed body such as the Federal system.  Lean and Mean.
Don't Mess with Texas!  We have the infrastructure to provide our needs as to
food, fuel, energy, etc..  What we don't have, we simply import or export just
like Mexico and Canada.  Once Texas BECAME A COUNTRY, we would develop our own
tax structure, income and/or sales taxes, as well as welfare with specific
limitations and restrictions.  The sooner people are forced to take
responsibility for their actions, the sooner this excuse ridden society will
improve and get back on track.

There are NO legitimate cases for welfare SPONSORED BY GOVERNMENT!  That is
what charitable organizations, family and friends are for.

The function of Government, in my opinion,

  1)  is to create and maintain an infrastructure of roads, bridges, waterways
      and other transport routes for commercial and private transport
  2)  establish and provide for regulation of public utilities
  3)  provide for a fair and just legal system
  4)  establish and provide good relations with other countries with a focus
      on a fair import/export balance
  5)  provide for a solid, stable currency backed up by the gold standard
  6)  collect reasonable taxes to support NECESSARY government activities
  7)  full PUBLIC accountability to the public for all actions of the
      government or its agents
  8)  continually work for the least possible interference in the lives and
      activities of its citizens
  9)  strive for ways to improve government efficiency and service
 10)  limits on all public service jobs, such jobs should be just that,
      SERVICE!  This includes all aspects of TEXAS government.
 11)  provide for efficient and modern communication and postal systems
 12)  provide for public education available to all TAXPAYERS and their
      children, this includes college
 13)  provide for medical services based on systems such as used in Canada or
      Germany
 14)  continually look for better ways to carry out government functions and
      services in order to improve or enhance the lives of its citizens by
      superior leadership and direction
 15)  establish an equitable patent and copyright system that is legally
      binding and enforceable
 16)  provide for TOUGH prison systems with a major focus on rehabilitation
 17)  provide for reasonable support of advanced and alternative research that
      would benefit humanity, the environment, or offer commercial prospects
      that would benefit the Country of Texas

There are no doubt others, but this is a general idea.

Computers and information services could provide major advances in both
medical and legal systems.  They should never be relied on AS THE FINAL WORD,
but should be used as expert systems for ADVICE and SUGGESTIONS as to the best
possible decision.  This would help to clear our court caseloads and reduce
early releases based on human error or emotional decisions.  It would also
reduce medical costs by helping to diagnose and cure medical problems at
reduced cost and greatest speed.

The United States was DESIGNED as a REPUBLIC, not the bastardized form of
government we have come to call DEMOCRACY.  The definition of these is;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the American Heritage Dictionary

   Democracy -  government by the people exercised either directly or through
                elected representatives
   Republic  -  any political order that is not a monarchy,
                a constitutional form of government, esp. a democratic one

This Republic definition is not what I remember from American Government
class.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the Merriam-Webster Dictionary

   Democracy -  government by the people, esp.; rule of the majority,
                a government in which the supreme power is held by the people,
   Republic  -  a government having a chief of state who is NOT a monarch and
                is usually a President,
                a government in which supreme power is held by the citizens
                ENTITLED TO VOTE and is EXERCISED by elected officers and
                representatives governing according to law

How many times do you hear that the United States is a DEMOCRACY?  It is
nothing of the sort and has not been for many years.  Yes, we have elected
officials, an electoral college to 'filter' certain of our selections,
unending terms for incumbent officials, and for those who can see, a penchant
to elect the ones who promise the most or look the best.  Examples?  Dan
Quayle, Bill Clinton....

Would this change were Texas to become a Country?  YES, I KNOW so, because we
would no longer be BOUND BY some of the constraints of the US Constitution and
Federally CREATED laws that don't consider our views or locales.  The more
opinions voiced, the greater the confusion if those opinions are not filtered
to represent the best possible choice.  That is the purpose of our elected
officials.  We choose them based on what they CLAIM, not what they DO when
actually in office.  They are not held accountable.  Such public service jobs
should be carried out by responsible people with NO vested or personal
feelings bearing on the subject.

People in public office are there TO SERVE their country, not those who paid
to get them elected.  Without the term limits that everyone is currently
harping on, vested interests abound.  That is one of the major problems with
the Federal system, not enough young blood and new ideas which would follow
with regular changes.  Since we will never be able to change so many diseased
or corrupted aspects of the Federal government, SECESSION will allow us in
TEXAS to step completely out of FEDERAL control and INTO OUR OWN.  The states
should be allowed to choose their own way, with NO interference or control
from a Federal source. That has not been the case and the Federal control
continually extends itself into our lives and businesses.

Did you know that about 41% of your income and mine goes to support the
government, not only state but FEDERAL?  Did you also know that only about 5%
of your total income is available for recreational purposes?  Why can't we as
the Country of Texas, go to a 10% or 15% FLAT INCOME TAX to support our
infrastructure?
                            God only asks for 10%!!

Texas is the only state which has the option of getting out of such a foolish
Federal system, it makes perfect sense that ALL Texans should do everything in
their power to PROMOTE SECESSION from the Union of the United States.  There
is nothing disloyal to the United States in such an action.  As humans, we
have to look after our OWN INTERESTS and what we can do not only individually
but TOGETHER to improve our lives.  Each person only has one life, we should
make it the best and most accomplished we can.  No doubt there will be many
problems involved in implementing secession.  Once the secession is complete,
Texas now becomes a country, it requires the same treatment by the United
States as Mexico and Canada.  Thus, borders will have to be established.

Other problems :

  1)  Currency -  do we use dollars or create our own based on a gold standard
  2)  Taxes    -  a)  Personal Income Tax
                  b)  sales tax
  3)  Welfare  -  hardball approach based on people taking personal
                  responsibility for their own actions (or inactions)
                  a)  don't have babies if you can't or won't support them
                  b)  get an education and a job
                  c)  live within your income and financial responsibilities
                  d)  you reflect your friends, so they influence your actions
  4)  Social Security - all funds paid into the United States are due and
                  transferrable to the COUNTRY of Texas to restore payments
                  already made into a diseased and corrupt Federal system, the
                  entire Social Security system needs to be reworked or
                  abolished based on the requirements of TEXANS

These are just a minor sprinkling of problems we would have to deal with once
Texas became an independent country.  The entire United States has major
problems that just continue to worsen.  As I see it, 99% are due to a very
simple failure.  People don't take responsiblity for their actions.  They know
someone will take care of them, especially the Federal system, when they screw
up their lives or create problems for others.  The more vocal the group, the
more control they have over our government.  The politician who promises to
give the most to his constituents, WINS. The system is therefore highly biased
to FAVOR and REWARD those who expect something for nothing.  Those of us who
work and try to do the best thing for ourselves, our families and our local
area are continually sapped financially to support Federal decisions and
actions which we have little or no say in.  As Ed Leedskalnin said;

       Government TO BE LASTING will have  to  be JUST.  This means it will
       have to protect  ALL  the property alike and all the  property  will
       have to pay  equal  taxes,  which means big property, big taxes, and
       small property, small taxes. Government CANNOT EXIST without taxes so
       only  those who pay taxes should vote and vote according to the taxes
       they pay.

       It is not sound to ALLOW THE WEAKLINGS TO VOTE.  Any  one who is too
       weak to MAKE  HIS  OWN  LIVING is not strong enough to vote, because
       their WEAK INFLUENCE  weakens the  state  and  a  degenerated  state
       cannot exist very long, but every state should be sound and lasting.
       By voting, the voters dictate the state's destiny for  times to come
       and then to  allow  such  a weak influence to guide the state, it is
       not wise and so you see one should  vote  according  to  how  HE  is
       carrying the State's burden. (the right to vote, not the # of votes)

       Another unwise thing about equal voting is that it gives the LOAFERS
       AND WEAKLINGS the  power  to TAKE PROPERTY AWAY from  PRODUCERS  and
       STRONGER PEOPLE, and another unjust thing about equal voting is that
       it gives the LOAFERS AND WEAKLINGS an EASY LIFE (leached)  FROM  the
       (activities of the) producers and leaders.

       Self respecting producers will NOT STAND such an injustice for long.
       It is not the producer's fault when  one is too weak to MAKE HIS OWN
       LIVING.  The producer's life is just as sweet as the  weaklings  and
       loafers life is to them.

       To be lasting, the government should be built in the same way as the
       Supreme power of the land "the army."  Governments  have been rising
       and falling but the ARMY ALWAYS REMAINS.

       You know there  is  NO  EQUALITY  IN THE ARMY and so there can be NO
       EQUALITY IN THE STATE; if you are  not  AN EQUAL PRODUCER YOU CANNOT
       BE AN EQUAL CONSUMER.

       Fifty per cent  of  the  people  don't  want  to  lead, THEY WANT TO
       FOLLOW.  They want somebody else  to  furnish  the  money  for their
       living expenses and as long as such a condition exists, they are not
       equal with their leaders.

       That is the reason why everybody should be put in  the  right  place
       according to their physical ability and mental ability.

       There is only  one  way  to  share  the  National  income.  It is by
       sharing the production and if you  are  not  producing  equally  you
       cannot share equally.

                     NOBODY IS PRODUCING ANYTHING FOR OTHERS.

                      THEY ARE PRODUCING ONLY FOR THEMSELVES.

       People are INDIVIDUALS.  For instance, if you want an excitement you
       will have to TEST THE THRILL YOURSELF, or if you  have  a  pain  you
       will have to  BEAR IT YOURSELF, or if you want to eat, you will have
       to EAT FOR YOURSELF.

       Nobody can eat for you and so it is  that  if you want the things to
       eat you will have to produce them YOURSELF and IF YOU  ARE TOO WEAK,
       TOO LAZY, LACK  MACHINERY  and  GOOD MANAGEMENT to produce them, YOU
       SHOULD PERISH and that is all there is to it.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
Leedskalnin is a bit harsh with the 'SHOULD PERISH' phrase, society is what
separates us from the animals, but he has a distinct point.  Too many loafers
sap those who are producers.  Of course, they will vote for whoever promises
to give them the most with the least effort on their part.  Thereby
contaminating the laws and lives of those who produce and are functional
members of society.  TEXAS as a Country could change this, but not as a STATE!

We have two choices,

  1)  continue to ignore the ever more disastrous and controlling actions of
      'our' Federal government OR
  2)  start a petition voting for SECESSION OF TEXAS FROM THE UNITED STATES
      and circulate it to everyone in our state TO FORCE IT TO HAPPEN!

Daily news of our Federal government actions is so frustrating that I think
its time we TEXANS get involved in DOING SOMETHING, rather than sitting on our
butts like so many of the Conspiracy buffs!  We can't complain forever...Our
State Constitution GIVES US THE RIGHT to make a radical difference in our OWN
lives and through repercussions, the United States as a whole!

I have no experience in such matters, so your ACTIVE help and support is
NECESSARY to make this happen. If you are interested in getting SERIOUSLY
involved in the SECEDE TEXAS petition, please write to -  SECEDE, PO BOX 1031,
Mesquite, TX 75149.  It is now 12/05/94....let's make some progress!

I will get back to you with a meeting place, date and time.  Please include an
address and phone number so I can call or write you.  We need to know how many
to expect at the first meeting.  At this point, the general idea is to get a
group of people together in the Metroplex area, setup some kind of plan of
action, establish a board to organize and sustain the effort and provide some
kind of funding.

If you are a TEXAN, it's up to YOU and to ME to make this happen!  It is not
far-fetched in the least and will have far-reaching ramifications.  I am
faxing versions of this and making copies to pass out to friends and contacts,
primarily in the State of Texas where YOUR VOTE will COUNT!  THANKS!...>>> JWD
