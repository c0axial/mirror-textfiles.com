       The following was  taken  from  the  Monday,  January 4, 1993, "Wall
       Street Journal" entitled

             "Nonlethal Arms, New Class of Weapons Could Incapacitate
             Foe Yet Limit Casualties -  Military  Sees  Role  for  Lasers,
           Electromagnetic Pulses, OtherHigh-Tech Tricks  -  Sticky  Roads,
                                  Stalled Tanks",
                                by Thomas B. Ricks

       If the U.S.  eventually  intervenes  in  the former Yugoslavia, says
       Col. Jamie Gough, the Air Force's  deputy  director of planning, its
       arsenal "absolutely" will  includea new class of devices:  nonlethal
       weapons.

       Without killing people,  such  weaponry  would  disrupt  telephones,
       radars, computers and other communications  and targeting equipment,
       he says.  Other defense officials say the damage would  be inflicted
       by a new  electromagnetic  "pulse" generator that disables equipment
       without hurting people.

       They say the  U.S. also could deploy  "combustion  inhibitors"  that
       stop the engines  of  moving  vehicles,  as well as  chemicals  that
       crystallize and destroy  certain  kinds of tires.  These new type of
       weapons are only a tiny fraction  of  the  current defense budget of
       $274.3 billion, but they are rapidly gaining favor.

       At least two  dozen  projects  exploringnonlethal  technologies  are
       under way at   defense  laboratories.   Several  of  the  U.S.'s  10
       regional commanders-in-chief within the past 18 months have sent the
       Joint Chiefs classified  "mission   needs   statements"  asking  for
       nonlethal weapons.  Les Aspin, President elect Clinton's nominee
       for Secretary of  Defense,  has also expressed interest  innonlethal
       weaponry.

       So sorry -  If  the  Gulf  War  made "smart" weapons familiar to the
       world, the next U.S. conflict is likely to introduce "nicer" weapons
       - in what could be a noteworthy step in American military strategy.

                                      Page 1





       By devising ways  to  stop an adversary without killing its soldiers
       or devastating their  hardware,   advocates  say,  the  U.S.   could
       greatly widen its range of potential military responses  to  threats
       abroad.  Proponents of  nonlethality  say  it  may be best suited to
       Somalia and other "peacemaking" missions  the U.S. military may take
       on in the post-Cold War world.  Marines in Mogadishu  may  soon wish
       they had stun  guns  or  other nonlethal means of disarming 14-year-
       olds toting AK-47s, notes one fan of the new weaponry.

       Despite the name, nonlethal weapons  are hardly gentle, and in a few
       instances, they could  even make war more grotesque.   For  example,
       powerful lasers designed  to  destroy  an  enemy tank's optics could
       also explode a soldier's eyeballs.  Portable microwave weapons being
       field-tested by the  U.S.  Special  Forces  can  quietly  cut  enemy
       communications but also can cook internal organs.

       "I don't know that nonlethality is all that humane," concludes Myron
       L.  Wolbarsht, a Duke University ophthalmologist and expert on laser
       weapons.  Backdoor Nuke?

       What's more, the quiet U.S. move into nonlethality  could pry open a
       Pandora's box of  chemical,  biological  and  nuclear  weaponry that
       diplomats have spent much of the 20th century trying to keep closed.
       The U.S.Central Command, the unified  command  for  the  Middle East
       that formerly was headed by Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf,  has  told  the
       Joint Chiefs of  Staff  that it wants a wide-area-pulse capability -
       that is, the  ability  to  fry enemy  electronics  by  detonating  a
       warhead outside the atmosphere.

       The Central Command's statement didn't expressly say  so, but only a
       nuclear explosion would  be  powerful  enough to do the job. "You're
       probably talking about a few tens  of kilotons," says Earl Rubright,
       science adviser to the Central Command.  He contends  that the Iraqi
       army invading Kuwait  in  1991  could  have been stopped nonlethally
       with one such pulse blast.

       Even in its less controversial forms,  nonlethality  has been caught
       up in the  debate  about the U.S. role in the post-Cold  War  world.
       Joint Chiefs Chairman  Colin  Powell argues that the U.S. should use
       its military only when it can apply decisive and overwhelming force.

       Nonlethality lowers that hurdle by  making  it  easier to invoke the
       military in a  crisis.  "It gives you more options,  but  there's  a
       danger of illusions  that  these things can be done more quickly and
       precisely," says a senior Air Force officer.

       Practical Considerations - Many officers  also wonder how the exotic
       new weapons would  work  on  the  battlefield.  Disabling  equipment
       could require better  targeting  intelligence than the U.S. gathered
       in the Gulf War.  And once a platoon  of  advancing  tanks had been,
       say, pulsed or "lasered" into submission, how would a commander know
       which ones really had lost their targeting mechanisms and which were
       playing possum?

       A bigger worry is that nonlethal weapons someday  may  be  aimed  at
       U.S.  forces.  Because  the U.S. military is increasingly high-tech,
       "it's perhaps more  vulnerable  to   disabling  measures  than  many
       potential adversaries," an Army paper warns. But nonlethality also


                                      Page 2





       has many military  advocates, especially among defense intellectuals
       who see it redefining modern warfare.

       What took 9,000 bombs to destroy in  World  War II, and 300 bombs in
       Vietnam, theoretically required only a single smart bomb in the Gulf
       War.

       In the next  war,  with  precise targeting abilities  and  nonlethal
       weapons, they ask whether we need a bomb at all.  These boosters see
       nonlethal armaments as  part  of  the transition from industrial-era
       wars of direct-fire attrition to information-age  wars  in which the
       emphasis is on paralyzing the adversary, not necessarily  destroying
       him.

       Rather than replace  artillery  and  explosives,  the  new nonlethal
       weaponry would be mixed into the old  arsenal.  For instance, a 40mm
       laser cartridge has  been developed to fit into a  standard  grenade
       launcher, Milton Finger,   director  of  the  Advanced  Conventional
       Weapons program at Lawrence Livermore  National Laboratory, predicts
       that nonlethal weapons  will  become "an important  adjunct  to  the
       common instruments of war."

       "They're all real,"  says  retired  Army  Lt.Gen.  Richard Trefry, a
       former military assistant  to   President   Bush   and   a   fan  of
       nonlethality.  "But you're bordering on classified stuff here."

       To figure out  how to use the new weapons, the Army's  Training  and
       Doctrine Command in  September  circulated  to  the  military's  top
       commanders a 34-page draft statement  on nonlethal weapons.  "A wide
       range of disabling  measures,  technologies  and  applications   now
       exists," it states.   "This  was  not  true 10 years ago. "One major
       reason they do exist now is that about  a decade ago, John Alexander
       began thinking about  them.   An  Army  Special  Forces  veteran  of
       Vietnam, he led ethnic Cambodian irregulars in the Mekong Delta.  He
       went on to study near-death experiences with Elisabeth Kubler-Ross.

       Then in 1980  he  published  an  article in Military Review magazine
       about "the new mental battlefield,"  which  he  said  could  involve
       telepathy or weapons   that   interferred  with  the   brain's   own
       electrical activity.  That  caught  the attention of two senior Army
       generals, who encouraged  him  to   pursue  what  were  then  called
       "softkill' technologies.

       In 1988, Col.  Alexander  left  the military and joined  Los  Alamos
       National Laboratory, where   he   is   attached   to   the   special
       technologies group.  Meanwhile, his  interest  in parapsychology led
       him to collaborate on a book on mind-training techniques  with Janet
       Morris, a science-fiction writer interested in counterterrorism.

       She enlisted Ray  Cline,  a well-connected former deputy director of
       the Central Intelligence Agency, who  was  able to open doors at the
       White House and  Pentagon.   "A U.S. lead in nonlethal  technologies
       will increase our  options  and  reinforce our position in the post-
       Cold War world, "Paul Wolfowitz,  under  secretary  of  defense  for
       policy, wrote to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney after  the  Gulf War.
       "Our R&D efforts must be increased."

       Roach Motel -  A  Pentagon  strategy group called together after the
       war was entranced by the possibilities.  One lesson of the Gulf War

                                      Page 3





       was that U.S.  high technology worked; another was that global media
       coverage could quickly  turn  heavy   casualties,   even  among  the
       adversary, into a  political issue.  By using technology  to  reduce
       casualties,

       Nonlethality heeds both lessons.  The strategists envisioned that in
       a subsequent crisis,  nonlethal  weapons  could  first  be  used  in
       concert with economic sanctions.

       For example, roads leading into an  embargoed nation could be dusted
       with crystallizing powder  that  would  destroy truck  tires.   Fuel
       tankers going into  the  area  could be clandestinely treated with a
       microbe that jellifies gasoline.

       Aircraft runways in the area could  be  closed by spraying them with
       super-sticky "Roach Motel"  polymers.   Railroad  tracks   could  be
       rendered useless by    super-slick    antitraction    polymers   and
       lubricants.  Bridges could  be quietly  weakened  with  supercaustic
       acids so that refugees could cross, but not trucks.

       People moving into restricted zones, such as border crossings, could
       be trapped by quick-setting "hard" foam, or deterred  from  entering
       by acoustic generators  that could be fine-tuned to be anything from
       mildly irritating to organ-bursting.   As  the  hypothetical  crisis
       escalated, the Pentagon strategists dreamed, other nonlethal weapons
       could come into play.

       What, they asked, if the U.S. could pre-emptively disable the
       other side's "trump  card"  weapons?   Secret  low-orbit  satellites
       could neutralize the launch sites of a state threatening chemical or
       nuclear blackmail, or  even  pulse  out  the  electronic triggers on
       those weapons.  Meanwhile,  Special   Forces  operators  could  daub
       aircraft wings with  embrittling  chemicals,  while  drone  aircraft
       could cripple enemy  weapons  by  spraying  them  with  metal-eating
       microbes.  If war did occur, potent  microwaves could be deployed to
       detonate enemy ammunition dumps before the munitions could be used.

       Enemy communications could be fried by microwaves or by small pulses
       produced by non-nuclear devices. Enemy troops might  be greeted with
       lasers that blinded   their  targeting  devices.   Their  tanks  and
       personnel carriers might stall as  they  hit  clouds  of  combustion
       inhibitors and short-circuiting  metal fibers.  Then  the  nonlethal
       weapons designed to affect people might be deployed.

       "The anti-personnel stuff   is  extremely  desirable  but  extremely
       difficult," says retired Col. Alexander,  the Los Alamos specialist.
       Among the concerns:   Some   applications  might  violate   treaties
       governing war practices.   In  addition,  notes  Harvard  biochemist
       Matthew Meselson, nonlethal  tactics,   especially  those  involving
       chemicals, could escalate  into lethal ones.  Notwithstanding  these
       worries, anti-personnel nonlethal   devices   are  being  researched
       intensively.

       Lawrence Livermore lists a half-dozen  potential ways of temporarily
       incapacitating combatants, such  as  dazzling  them   with   lasers,
       putting them to  sleep  with  calmative chemicals and even confusing
       them with holographic projections in the clouds above them - perhaps
       images of Muslim martyrs telling them  to go home.  Some research is
       spilling into the civilian sector, too.

                                      Page 4





       The Justice Department's   research   arm  is  piggybacking  several
       projects and expects within a few  years  to  test  foam  and  light
       immobilizers for use  against  everything  from  ordinary   domestic
       disturbances to prison riots.

       Repairing the Damage - In military use, a big advantage of nonlethal
       weaponry comes after    the    shooting   and   pulsing   is   over.
       Reconstruction would be   far    easier    if,    say,    electrical
       infrastructure could be  restored  by  replacing   a  few  blown-out
       switches and wires.   "Say  there's  a  war  in Korea," says one Air
       Force bomber pilot. "You want it  won,  but  the day the war's over,
       you want to reunify them,and not have to spend five years rebuilding
       it."  The Pentagon's nonlethal study group came away so enthusiastic
       that it not  only  recommended a major push into nonlethal  weapons,
       but also suggested  that President Bush announce a public initiative
       akin to President  Reagan's  unveiling   of  his  Strategic  Defense
       Initiative, or "Star Wars."

       That idea drew  fire.  Taking nonlethality public  "would  have  the
       effect of spurring  our  adversaries  to  look  into this," says one
       Pentagon policy maker.  Other experts  thought  that  a presidential
       declaration might make  further  development  prone   to   political
       meddling.  So Pentagon   policymakers   decided   to  intensify  the
       nonlethality effort but do it even more secretly than previously.

       They also seem to have cut out Janet  Morris and Ray Cline, who were
       perceived within the  Pentagon  as  meddlesome  and   uncontrollable
       outsiders.  To make  nonlethality  even  less visible, policy makers
       decreed that it  henceforth  would   be   referredto  as  "disabling
       systems" technologies.  But the next time the U.S.  goes  to war, it
       almost certainly will  deploy  some  kinds of nonlethal weapons.  It
       may well face them, too.

       By the end of this century, Prof.  Wolbarsht predicts in a new book,
       laser weapons "will find their way  into  armies all over the world.
       "Nonlethal Weapons:  A Selection -Taken from "Operations Concept for
       Disabling Measures (Draft),"  U.S.   Army  Training   and   Doctrine
       Command, September 1992.

       Laser Weapons: "Resembling  conventional  rifles,  low-energy  laser
       rifles withpower packs can flash-blind  people  and  disable optical
       and infrared systemsused  for  target acquisition,  tracking,  night
       vision and range finding.

       "Infrasound: "Very low  frequency sound generators could be tuned to
       incapacitate humans, causing disorientation,  nausea,  vomiting,  or
       bowel spasms.  The effect ceases as soon as the generator  is turned
       off, with no lingering physical or enviornmental damage."

       Supercaustics:  "Supercaustics can be millions of times more caustic
       than hydofluoric acid.   A  round  that  delivers jellied superacids
       could destroy the  optics  of heavily  armored  vehicles,  penetrate
       vision blocks or  glass,  or  be  employed to silently  destroy  key
       weapons systems or components."

       Antitraction Technology: "Using  airborne  delivery systems or human
       agents, we can spread or spray Teflon-type, environmentally neutral,
       lubricants on railroad tracks, grades,  ramps,  runways, even stairs
       and equipment, potentially denying their use for a substantial

                                       Page





       period, because such  lubricants  are  costly  and time-consuming to
       remove."

       Roach Motels:  "Polymer adhesives,  delivered  by air or selectively
       on the ground,  can  'glue'  equipmentin  place  and  keep  it  from
       operating."

       Combustion Alteration: "Internal combustion engines can be disrupted
       through special chemical  compounds.  These chemical compounds would
       temporarily contaminate fuel or  change  its  viscosity  to  degrade
       engine function."

       Computer Virus Technology:  "This  technology  focuses  on  computer
       systems which control  fire support systems, data transmission, fire
       control systems, avionics, etc.  It involves the covert intrusion of
       a computer virus, logic bomb, or worm  which may remain hidden until
       the system is     used     or     meets    specific     parameters."

       So there you  have  it!   Does  this  make  mush  out of some of the
       scientific skeptics on this echo?   I  hope so, because this post is
       but a fraction of what is going on and posted to  inform  those  not
       yet aware that  things  are  far  beyond what most consider reality.
       Also in the  banned  book  Operation   Mind   Control,   our  secret
       governments war against its own people.  W.H.  Bowart  claims in the
       seventies that it  was  possible  to  control  people from cradle to
       grave.  Sound outragious? Well folks  welcome to the new age because
       it is taking place unbeknownst to everyone.  This statement  is just
       my opinion after  going  through  a huge amount of constant incoming
       info that makes me think its happening.   If  you  want  more proof.
       Here is a   source.   Julianne   Mckinney,   Director    Electronics
