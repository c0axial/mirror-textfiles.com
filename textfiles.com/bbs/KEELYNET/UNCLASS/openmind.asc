       To paraphrase T.B. Pawlicki, researchers should keep an open
       mind...but, not open so wide that their brains fall out.  As we
       begin to follow the path of ZP energy, we find correlations with
       anti-g, which raises more questions concerning UFOs and levitation,
       which then takes us back in time to the pyramids and "henges", etc.
       It's difficult to maintain a focus on the end goal with so many
       attractive "distractions" along the way.

       I've noticed that many people get "hung up" on specific areas, and I
       have heard that there are even groups who WORSHIP UFOs!  Maybe it's
       just cases of information overload, I don't know, but whenever you
       stop at one point, you will miss the total picture.  I have to keep
       asking myself, "OK, what is the significance of any aspect to the
       whole picture?"  There IS a big picture, and all of these smaller
       pictures are related.

       There IS a common thread between Tesla coils, caduceus coils,
       pyramids, UFOs, the Ark of the Covenant, ley lines, neutral centers,
       medicinal healing, chakras, medicine wheels, ancient domes of wisdom
       (originally called WISEDOMES, shortened to WISDOM), levitation,
       gravity, transmutation and plasma energy.  This thread is RESONANCE.
       Here is what I've found so far:

       Tesla coils operate at resonance, and operate at 3-4 times unity.

       Caduceus coils, the symbol of the A.M.A., were used with resonators
       by Egyptian priests to resonate stones for pyramid construction.

       UFOs are, from measurement of crop circles, built on diameters which
       conform to notes on the diatonic scale, making them resonant by
       design.

       The Ark of the Covenant, as constructed, is a powerful capacitor.
       It is the same EXACT size as the coffer from the King's Chamber of
       the Great Pyramid.  Just as the pyramid was designed to be a
       physical size harmonic of the earth, the Ark was designed to be a
       harmonic of the pyramid, and as such was a tuned resonant component
       in the energy grid.

       Healing devices operate either by resonantly "shattering" the
       invading microorganisn, or by resonantly strengthening the body's
       energies, knows as the Seven Chakras.

                                      Page 1





       The Chakras are the neutral energy centers comprised of vortical
       flows within the human body.  These centers have been verified and
       even photo-graphed, exactly where the ancients SAID they are.

       Medicine Wheels are found all over the North American continent.
       These designs in stone conform to ley line intersection points, and
       contain the same geometric constants as are found in pyramids.  In
       other words, they are resonators of earth energy.

       Domes of Wisdom predate the pyramids, but were originally
       constructed on sites where pyramids were later built.  These sites
       are Bloch Walls of the earth energy grid.  The resonance of the
       earth itself was focused in these domes, and those who "studied"
       there were the astronomers, priests, and mathematicians of their
       societies.

       Levitation occurs when the effect of gravity is removed by
       cancelling the spin energy between electrical and electromagnetic
       fields.  There are several methods of accomplishing this, all of
       which involve resonating the neutral center of the mass.  Any
       object, from a masonery block to a mother ship, is levitated using
       these principles.  At energy grid sites, or at major ley line
       intersections, this can be done with VERY PRIMITIVE tools, because
       the Bloch Wall assists in the levitation.  More advanced "tools" can
       use this energy anywhere, but also use ley line power for ion
       drives.  Ever wonder why so many UFOs are seen in Gulf Breeze?  It's
       for the same reason that the Coral Castle was built there, to use
       the levitating power of the Bloch Wall.

       Gravity, as previously defined, is not a discrete form of energy,
       which is why it has eluded description/analysis for so many years.
       Mass is comprised of atoms, which are essentially spinning
       particles.  Electro-magnetism exists because the earth is a spinning
       magnet, around an iron core.  The EFFECT of these forces is gravity.
       Cancel the effect, and you cancel the gravity.  RESONATE the mass,
       and you cancel the spin, and cancel the effect.  As John Searl
       discovered, if you spin a perforated disk over magnet/coil
       combinations until you reach resonance, the disk will rise.

       Transmutation, disdained by science as "alchemy", yet PRACTICED by
       these same scientists in cyclotrons, is the method by which an
       element is altered until it becomes a different element.  The old
       "lead into gold" trick has been repeated over and over, BUT the cost
       of the process is said to exceed the value of the gold produced by
       the scientists.  Once again, the process is dependent upon
       resonance.  By changing the energy, you change the mass.

       Plasma drives are an example of the release of tachyon energy at
       resonance.  By ionizing the plasmas which exist throughout the
       universe, and this is achieved by spinning a disk as done by Searl,
       the energy field becomes energized by ZP virtual particles.  The
       disk becomes self-powered, and the neutral centers are in self-
       resonance.

       While mainstream scienctists have denied and ridiculed most or all
       of the above, they have been developing the same concepts into
       weapons.  This has resulted in altered weather patterns, magnetic
       polar shifting (the Taos Hum), psychotronic weapons, earthquakes,
       including the largest in recorded history, etc.  Now that major

       defense contractors own broadcast networks, don't expect to see or
       hear ANYTHING that they don't want you to know.

       Nothing is "alien" if it works in nature.  We have to look at past
       civilizations to understand nature, because, even though they
       limited "access" to the truth to their "initiates", they HAD to work
       in the open, and left the keys to understanding in the form of
       pyramids and henges.  It is not beyond reason that some of these
       civilizations left survivors, whom we think of as "aliens".

       How does one mind grasp the "big picture", and fit these pieces
       together?  Also, what of the space/time altering effects of powerful
       resonating machines, and the effect on our environment?  How do you
       avoid "fixating" on one aspect, to the exclusion of the others?  How
       much "truth" do we really want?  I don't know.  But I DO know that
       serious researchers must learn as much as possible.  Just as ancient
       civilizations self-destructed by the misapplication of resonance,
       with their comparatively primitive tools, modern civilizations can
       do the same, but with tools of such enormous power that the planet
       itself may be strained beyond survival.

       I think, for the sakes of our children and theirs, that we must
       continue to learn, test and apply as much as we can, as fast as we
       can.  Open your mind and share with others.  Expect ridicule,
       censure, or worse.  Don't fixate on one aspect...soak up as much as
       you can, from as many differing sources as you can.  Look FIRST for
       the resonance, and if you find it, continue on.

       Many researchers have reported a "mental block" as they approach
       either understanding or building devices.  It is felt as a sense of
       panic, perhaps because this knowledge calls into question so many of
       our foundation beliefs, such as religion.  It is a particularly hard
       "wall" to get over.  However, WHAT IF knowledge of the truth
       REINFORCED religious belief, perhaps not of one denomination, but of
       the FAMILY of beliefs in a higher being, and ultimately of a higher
       self?  Maybe this would be acceptable for some, but not for
       all...maybe not for most.

       There are so many questions, how do you know when your mind is TOO
       open, and your brains are "falling out"?  Personally, I avoid any
       "explanation" which has a bias toward any political or religious
       belief...someone ALWAYS has an axe to grind!  Then, I look for the
       resonance.  It doesn't matter whether the subject is Lemurian
       crystal resonators or Orgone energy boxes, if it doesn't resonate,
       it doesn't work.  Lastly, I ask myself what the practical
       application might be.  Personal benefits might be as simple as a
       feeling of understanding about the nature of reality, or improved
       health, or a more profound closeness with one's God.

       Globally, it may be possible to restore the harmonic balance which
       others have injured through their ignorance and greed.  This is an
       awesome task, but is it feasible, using "primitive tools"?  Some say
       yes, provided that no more damage is done.

       Locally, does creating a simple free energy device or two matter?  I
       believe that it matters, only to the extent that it creates an
       awareness of the ZP, resonance and the REAL history of our existance
       here.  To the non-initiated ancients, the technology was passed
       along as religion.  The priests deified themselves, and soon their

                                      Page 3





       civilizations ceased to exist.  They knew NOTHING that we aren't
       capable of understanding!  However, unless the populace is aware of
       the reality of resonant energy, history will repeat but with far
       more severe consequences.

       I personally don't believe that the knowledge of resonance, as
       manifested in pyramids and religious devices, occurred
       "spontaneously".  The teachers came to the students whenever the
       students were ready, and these teachers have alternately been called
       angels and/or aliens.

       An angel is, BY DEFINITION, an alien.  It's interesting that reports
       of BOTH are increasing in frequency, perhaps as we near the edge of
       earth cataclysms which were prophesied by ALL of the world's major
       religions.

       We've only scratched the surface in our understanding.  So much has
       been lost, buried and burned over time that we may never know as
       much as we could have...but maybe we know enough to figure out the
       rest.  I think that future history will be determined by those whose
       minds remain open at this critical juncture of time.
