       For the last few years, we have heard of people who claim to be able
       to dissociate one  from  the  tax  system  and  do it legally.  As I
       understood it, the fees begin at $600  and can go up to $3000 but it
       is claimed that one will no longer have to pay taxes.

       You must disavow  yourself  of  the  Social  Security  System,  your
       Drivers License and  other things that I am unclear on.  Part of the
       idea was that the Federal government  only  has  power over about 13
       acres in the  city  of  Washington and DOES NOT have  dominion  over
       anything outside those boundaries.

       When you sign up for Social Security and all the tax rigamarole, you
       allow yourself to be under the control of this mini government.  The
       following article describes  how one local group was busted.  As you
       can tell, KeelyNet does not normally  follow  such subjects although
       the claims are  intriguing especially if there is  any  validity  to
       them.  Strange that  the  IRS  and  the  FEDS  seem so persistent on
       busting these folks if it doesn't work anyway.

                  State accuses company of selling false tax data
                                   by Anne Belli

       The Texas attorney  general's  office  Thursday  sued  a  Richardson
       business (suburb of  Dallas)  accused  of selling false  information
       advising consumers that they don't have to pay federal income taxes.

       Also Thursday, the  Internal  Revenue  Service  seized  many  of the
       records, books, files and computers of the business, Certified Untax
       Consultants, as part of a federal criminal investigation.

       The state is seeking a court order  to  shut down the business.  The
       IRS is continuing a criminal investigation, officials said.

       Officials with the company denied any illegal activity and said they
       were being unfairly targeted by the state and federal governments.

       "This is just  part  of their fear and intimidation  tactics,"  said
       Richard L. Summers, 57, one of the business's three consultants.

       In addition to  Mr.  Summers,  the  attorney general's suit names as
       defendants Mr. Summers' wife, Shirley  A. Summers, 58 and Charles A.
       Dixon, 55.  The three call themselves "untax" consultants.

                                      Page 1





       The suit also  names  The  Pilot  Connection,  a  company  based  in
       Stockton, Calif., that developed the  "tax avoidance" material being
       marketed by the Richardson business.

       Darrell Spencer, general  manager of the Pilot Connection,  defended
       the organization and  said  all the information it sells through its
       consultants is accurate and based on IRS manuals.

       "Our program works," Mr. Spencer  said.  "It  works really good, and
       that's why they hate us so much."

       Specifically, the attorney   general's   suit   alleges   that   the
       Richardson company sells  a  program  that  advises consumers on how
       they may avoid paying taxes.  The  program, essentially a package of
       information that costs $2,100, contains false information that could
       result in civil and criminal penalties, the suit alleges.

       Some of the  false  information,  according  to the  suit,  includes
       contentions that:

          The IRS is NOT a part of the U.S. Treasury Department, rather a
          private Delaware corporation.

          The IRS lacks the authority to administer and enforce the federal
          internal revenue laws.

          Paying income  taxes  is  voluntary,  and  no  civil  or criminal
          penalties may result.

          A person may avoid paying income  taxes by not maintaining a bank
          account or signing a bank signature card.

          No law has been enacted ordering the payment of income taxes, and
          it is  legally  possible to permanently remove oneself  from  the
          income tax system.

       "The dangerous part about this is that some people may think they're
       buying bona fide advice when really what they're doing is signing up
       to be tax protestors," said Assistant Attorney General Robert Reyna,
       chief of the consumer protection division in Dallas.

       Mr. Reyna said he did not know how many people had purchased the tax
       avoidance packages through  the  Richardson  company.   But about 50
       people a week have attended seminars explaining it, Mr. Reyna said.

       Mr. Summers said the Richardson office  had  been  in business since
       October and had sold between 50 and 100 packages.

       "We haven't had anyone dissatisfied," Mr. Summers said.  "Nobody has
       asked us for a refund."

       Mr. Spencer said  the  program teaches people how  to  avoid  paying
       taxes, not evade   them.   Still,  he  acknowledged,  the  program's
       suggestions "aren't traditional methods."

       He agreed that the program recommends  against  establishing  a bank
       account.  But he  said  that  doins so would prevent  the  IRS  from
       illegally seizing assets.

       "Our position is  that if you legitimately owe a tax that you should
       pay it," Mr. Spencer said.  "But we teach legal tax avoidance."

       He said The Pilot Connection had been  in  operation since 1982, but
       he declined to say how many "certified associate members,"  like the
       Summerses and Mr. Dixon, were operating nationwide.

       "I will tell you that we operate in every state," he said.

       Mr. Reyna said  he  would ask state District Judge Bill Rhea to soon
       set a court hearing to issue a temporary  injunction  preventing the
       Certified Untax Consultants and The Pilot Connection from operating.

       Eventually the attorney general's office wants the company to refund
       to consumers what they paid for the program, according  to the suit.
       It also seeks  up  to  $10,000  in  damages  from each defendant for
       violation of the state Deceptive Trade Practices Act.

       "This is the beginning of tax season,  and  we want to send an early
       warning to consumers  that  they  should take a look  at  these  tax
       packages," Mr. Reyna said.
