                         How David Copperfield caused the
                          Statue of Liberty to Disappear

       For anyone who  saw  the  TV  broadcast  of the disappearance of the
       Statue of Liberty, it was nothing short of miraculous.  Not only was
       it broadcast live, but a live audience  was  also present to witness
       that nothing was gimmicked.

       A giant lazy susan was constructed on which were mounted  two towers
       and a live audience.

       The towers formed  a giant "frame" for the lighted Statue of Liberty
       in the distance.  Very high intensity  lights were projected on both
       towers.

       The Statue was also lighted which made it easy to  see  between  the
       towers.

       When the time  came  for  the actual "disappearance", the giant lazy
       susan was very slowly rotated just  enough to cause the statue to be
       partially blocked by one of the towers.

       Concurrent with this, the lights on the Statue were turned out which
       made it difficult for the audience to see due to the brilliantly lit
       towers.

       The "radar" used to track the Statue throughout the  "disappearance"
       was in effect  a  video  game  which allowed the Statue to seemingly
       disappear from the screen, again concurrent  with  the timing of the
       illusion.

       Special effects are always interesting and we thought  some  of  our
       users might like to know how that particular stunt was done.
