     The contents of the following article are at present undocumented
    rumors which have been spoken of in various conversations with our
        KeelyNet and Vangard Sciences contributors and consultants.

                              Soviet Motives

            On the   real  reason  for  glasnost/perestroika  and  the
                   democratization of the Soviet Empire.

    Word is out about the true reason  for  the New Russian attitudes.
    Supposedly, the Russians are highly advanced in Scalar Technology.

    Application of Scalar waves are alleged to cause  an  acceleration
    of the half-life  of  unstable  (radioactive)  particles  to cause
    fission and subsequent explosion.

    This is said to have caused the accident  at  Chernobyl.  A Scalar
    transmitter was accidentally directed toward the  nuclear facility
    which caused the  uncontrolled  acceleration  of  the  radioactive
    elements.

    The current nuclear disarmament  frenzy  is  associated with troop
    pull-outs and the closing of assorted military bases.   If all the
    nuclear weapons are disarmed and dis-assembled, then the way would
    be clear for  a  direct  threat  on the part of the Russians using
    Scalar Technologies.

    These Scalar Technologies  include   a   wide  range  of  possible
    effects.  Among these, we can list the ability to:

       1)  inject extreme heat or cold into a localized area
       2)  materialize a mass such as a bomb into an area
       3)  project disease patterns which will manifest  in the target
           biologies
       4)  project various types of mind control.

    Russian friends who  have  been  in this country for about 7 years
    tell us most emphatically that the  stated  motives of the Russian
    government should be held under extreme suspicion.   These friends
    receive letters and visits from various Soviet friends who pass on
    the latest happenings  which  go mostly unreported to foreign news
    services.
