       Oohs and Oz: Was money the message?

       You thought _The Wizard of Oz_ was about a little girl named Dorothy
       and her dog named Toto and how a tornado  whisked  them off in their
       Kansas farmhouse to  an  amazing  fantasyland  ruled  by  a  strange
       magician, didn't you?

       How naive.

       L. Frank Baum's  children's  classic  is  actually an allegory about
       monetary policy, if a persistent theory is to be believed.  The idea
       seems to have  gained currency in  scholarly  circles  back  in  the
       1960s, was taken up by Gore Vidal some years later  and is enshrined
       in a prestigious  reference  work,  _The  New Palgrave Dictionary of
       Money & Finance_.  The latest edition  has  just  been  published by
       Stockton Press.  You can have a copy for a mere $595.

       Prof. Hugh Rockoff of Rutgers University, who wrote the _Palgrave_
       article, stresses that  "there really isn't any hard  evidence"  for
       the theory, but "I think I find it persuasive."

       Dr. Rockoff, who  teaches  economics,  explained the background last
       week:

       At the end of the 19th century, many  farmers  in the South and West
       were in debt.   Most  had  very  short-term  mortgages   by  today's
       standards.  They were hurt by high interest rates, a declining price
       level under the gold standard and a more precipitous drop during the
       depression of the 1890s.

       SILVER AND GOLD

       Populists led by  William  Jennings Bryan wanted to help the farmers
       by coining silver along with gold (their policy was known as

                                      Page 1




       "bimetallism").  This expansion  of  the  money  supply  would lower
       interest rates, increase prices and  pull  the  farmers out of their
       hole.

       Mr. Bryan captured the Democratic nomination in 1896  and castigated
       the Republican supporters  of  the  gold  standard  with  his famous
       "Cross of Gold" speech.  After losing  the  election, he tried again
       in 1900; he lost again.

       Enter _The Wizard  of  Oz_.   When  it was published  in  1900,  the
       monetary controversy was  fresh  on everyone's mind.  _Oz_ theorists
       believe Mr. Baum wrote it as an allegory,  with the Populists as the
       heroes and the gold crowd as the villains.  In the  grander versions
       of the theory, every character and virtually every object stands for
       something else.

       Dr. Rockoff explains   the   symbolism.    Oz   is   of  course  the
       abbreviation for ounce (of gold).  Dorothy, "always a staunch friend
       and honest to the core," is the American  people.   The good-natured
       Toto may represent the Prohibition Party.  The storm  represents the
       Populist movement.  The  Land  of  Oz  is the Eastern establishment,
       firm supporter of the gold standard.

       Dorothy's house lands on the Wicked  Witch  of  the  East,  who  Dr.
       Rockoff thinks may  represent either the Eastern financiers  or  the
       pro-gold former president  Grover  Cleveland.   The witch is wearing
       silver shoes.  In the movie they became ruby slippers.

       Dorothy is told to follow the Yellow Brick Road (the gold standard,
       obviously) to Emerald City (Washington).   Dorothy's  companions are
       the Scarecrow, representing  the farmers; the Tin Man,  representing
       American workers; and   the   Cowardly  Lion,  representing  William
       Jennings Bryan, not a bad sort but  cowardly for failing to stick to
       his principles in the 1900 campaign.

       They defeat the Wicked Witch of the West, who has been interprested
       variously as "the  malign forces of nature, western  financiers,  or
       more concretely William   McKinley,   Bryan's   opponent   in   both
       elections." And what  about  the   Wizard   himself?    Dr.  Rockoff
       speculates he represents  Mark  Hanna,  chairman of  the  Republican
       Party, who "was  considered for a time to be a sinister power behind
       the throne, although his image later softened."

       Dr. Rockoff said last week that although he isn't absolutely sure
       Mr. Baum had all this in mind, he's been using _The Wizard of Oz
       in class "for a long time."

       Who said economics couldn't be fun?
