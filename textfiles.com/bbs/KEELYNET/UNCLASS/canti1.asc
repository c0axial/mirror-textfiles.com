                               Aztec Songs & Poetry
                           of Visitors from Other Worlds

       Once again through investigation of little known records, there are
       glimpses of the  past,  these point at Ancient Astronauts landing on
       planet Earth. All poetry quotations  are  taken  from  Canti Aztechi
       (Aztec Songs) edited by Ugo Liberatore and Jorge Hernandez-Campos
       (Guanda, Perma, 1966). The number brackets refer to the songs listed
       at the end of each song.

       1.  Only for a little.
       2.  Like the spring grass.
       3.  At least the flowers.
       4.  Songs of sadness.
       5.  Songs for the ancestors (Tlapalla is "the place of the red and
           black" and "marks the path of the Sun from zenith to setting").
       6.  Lonely as a cloud.
       7.  The doubt.
       8.  Song of Xipe Totec, the drinker of night.
       9.  The kingdom of death.
       10. To the  god  of  war,  Huitzilopochtli  (the names  Amantia  and
           Pipitlan indicate  the  sea  and the southern section of the sky
           respectively).
       11. The poet's torment.
       12. The song of Tetlepanquetzanitin.
       13. Song of Friendship.

       Does one really live here on Earth?
       Not for all time, only for a little!                   (1)
       We come only to sleep,
       Only to dream.
       It is not true, it is not true
       That we have come to live on Earth!                    (2)
       But what can my heart do, if it is in vain
       That we come to live upon the earth,
       To flower in vain?                                     (3)
       Where, O my heart, is the place of life?
       Where is my true home?
       Where my true dwelling place?
       I suffer, here upon Earth.                             (4)
       Here the flowery death is born.

       Our ancestors, reached Earth . . .                     (5)
       What shall we sing, my friends?
       In what shall we rejoice?
       There alone our song lives,
       Where our ancestors were born.
       On Earth, where they lived . . .
       I suffer here on Earth . . .
       He who gives life conceals
       Men in a casket and in an ark . . . .
       But shall I see them? Shall my eyes see
       The faces of my father and my mother?
       Can they offer me their song,
       Their words, which I search for?
       Here is no one,
       They have left us as orphans, here on Earth.           (6)
       Where shall I go? Alas, where shall I go?
       Doubt hangs heavy upon me.
       PERHAPS TO THE HOUSE OF GOD,
       WHENCE ONE DESCENDS, IN THE CENTER OF THE SKY,
       Or here where one descends in the heart of
       Earth?                                                 (7)
       Green serpent of the lighting . . .                    (8)
       You are the quechol bird, color of fire,
       Which flies across the plain
       In the kingdom of death.                               (9)
       Huitzilopochtli, the warrior,
       He who acts on high
       Follows his own path . . .
       O marvellous dweller among the clouds . . .
       O dweller in the region of the frozen wings . . . .
       He causes the walls of fire to fall down
       Where the feathers are gathered.
       Thus he wages war
       And subdues the peoples . . .
       Eager for war, the Flaming One descends,
       He rages where the whirling dust arises.
       Come to our aid!
       There is war, there is burning.
       Those Pipitlan are our enemies                         (10)
       Friends, a mission has driven us to the world . . .    (11)
       It is true we shall become friends,
       It is true we shall live upon Earth,
       But the time will come when
       You will tire of our friendship.                       (12)
       I look with hatred on death and I suffer . . .
       It matters not what precious stones
       The same thread unites,
       It does not matter that we are united
       Like gems on the same necklace . . .
       My friend, my true friend,
       LET US LOVE ONE ANOTHER, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.
       As you know, so too do I know; we live only once.
       One day we shall go hence.
       We are come hear only to know one another,
       Only on loan have we come to Earth . . .
       Yet we live here with dejection,
       Here, where we are watched and spied upon . . .        (13)
