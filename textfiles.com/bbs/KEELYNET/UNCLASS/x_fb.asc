                         ARE FIREBALLS FLYING SAUCERS?
                              By James E. Hartman

                                 INTRODUCTION

With the advent of modern technologies I believe Fireballs can be produced in
countless ways and controlled by both military radar and self-sustaining
propulsion systems. And are used frequently around the world perhaps for
several purposes.

However, I am going to give a you a very simplistic overview of how a FIREBALL
system is controlled by the use of parabolic antenna's. (See X-FB1.GIF) Then
I'm going to let you read for yourself the fantastic stories of these amazing
war time machines.

Perhaps some of the effects on radios, clocks, cars, planes, animals,
electrical sources and even people may be linked to this research by world
governments.  Both my concepts and previously published accounts will answer
some of the burning questions about the origins of some FLYING SAUCERS.
Remember this speculation is based on available data.

              Fixed Parabolic RADAR Controlled Simple Fireballs.

A fireball is generated when three but preferably four or more microwave radar
sites aim their beams at a central point in the sky.  Perhaps a balloon filled
with electro-conductive gas that turns into a plasma state when ignited. <This
may explain the Roswell Weather Balloon Case> the skin may also be made of a
special heat treated high temperature electro-conductive material.

The balloon having a varied life span would change shape and color much like a
bubble. This is due to the heat and stress generated, including the distances
<potential> changing between microwave stations. Another possibility is the
balloon burns up on microwave contact and a fireball is produced in the gas
mixture alone.

Three, four or more radar stations are tuned at sightly different microwave
frequencies in a pyramid fashion as to induce eddy currents thereby producing
the artificial fireball.  If one or more radar sites goes off line the
artificial fireball will tend to shoot off into the sky the way natural
fireballs do and quickly burn out.

Controlling the lift, speed and direction is done via one or more microwave
sites changing their beamed power, pulse pattern or by swinging the
specialized parabolic antenna's about a few seconds of arc.  Depending on the
gas mixture, lifetimes for these artificial fireball will very greatly.

              Mobile Parabolic RADAR Controlled Simple Fireballs.

This means a remote site can be set-up in the field and the same basic
principles can be applied. However, this has far greater advantages. In that a
network or pyramid grid system could be set up from New York to Los Angeles.

A fireball can be switched over from one network of microwave sites to
another, even over the sea's by Navy Ships thereby effectively navigating the
globe.

                           Disc Controlled by RADAR

It is again conceivable energy could be pulsed to a disc shaped aircraft from
Microwave Radar Sites same as described above.  For people however, this is a
risky proposition in that high levels of radiation are being beamed at the
disc.  The disc would float in a plasma gas just as an electric meter disc
with an out of phase alignment between the voltage and current produces an
internal eddy current which lifts the disc in the High Frequency Plasma.

People inside would require special protection. This system would likely have
an auxiliary propulsion system based on Electrostatic propulsion <a sub-
system> that could on battery power alone operate for short periods or in
emergency mode or for landing.

This disc may use suction airfoils or specialized radiation absorption hard
shells in the case of people being on board.  I believe these discs contain
automatic guidance systems at all times.  Nowadays, I can foresee a digital
pulse propulsion that would prevent an enemy nation from capturing a flying
saucer via it's guidance system. I also suspect most flying saucers of this
type are unmanned.

Recent investigations in the field of plasma physics indicate that the time is
approaching when it will be possible to produce artificial spherical
"thunders" and to use them as defensive and offensive weapons. These
"thunders"(called globular fireballs) are thought to originate in the
atmosphere after strong electric discharges.

Tests are being conducted in an effort to produce these fireballs and to
utilize them as an antimissile defense.

                       REDS MAY USE LIGHTING AS A WEAPON

                  Missiles and Rockets, v.5, no.35, pp.13-14,
                                August 24, 1959

Soviet high-voltage experiments on artificial lighting are reported. G.I.
Babat, head of the Soviet Institute of Energetics, is quoted as hinting as
possible military applications.

Babat is said to propose generation of balls of lighting above cities by means
of two parabolic antennas. Such a flame ball could be moved by directing the
ground antennas, and could be used against aircraft or missiles (MGA,1963,
14.1-443)

                       KUGELBLITZ THE AUTOMATIC FIGHTER

                     THE "BALL LIGHTING" AUTOMATIC FIGHTER
                             VESCO RENATO (C) 1971
                    INTERCEPT BUT DON'T SHOOT, PP.156-157.

Parallel with the formation of the special S.S. Air Corps, the S.S. Technical
General Staff had not only espoused Marshal Goering's pressing demands for the
preparation of the "decisive" fighter, but had implemented them by having all
the aeronautics advances of the past two years sent to the industrial combine
of the "G. Werke."

Thus the principle of the symmetrical circular aircraft was combined with the
direct gyroscopic stabilization;

  synthetic firedamp was combined with the multiple-batteried blower cannon; a
      gelatinous organic metallic hyper-combustible was combined with the
      total reaction turbine;
  television-controlled flying was combined with vertical take-off and
      landing;
  armor that was sensitive to small-caliber projectiles and radio control that
      was free of enemy jamming were combined with the active blinding of
      enemy radar;
  infrared search "eyes" were combined with electrostatic weapon firing.

This marked the rapid development of the Feuerball, which became a weapon.

The Kugelblitz (Ball Lighting), which apparently for greater safety combined
the electrostatic firing device with an analogous short-wave device
manufactured by the Patent-Verwertungs Gesellschaft of Salzburg, lumped
together in a single compact mass the wings, tail, and fuselage of ordinary
planes, but it had nothing in common with them in either form or performance.
It was the first example of the "jet-lift" aircraft.

After a single lucky wartime mission, the Kugelblitz was subsequently
destroyed by technical detachments of retreating S.S. troops, and thanks to
the instructions that had been given to the investigators of the T force by
the exceedingly strict British military censorship, nothing else has come out
since then.

Even if ufologists do not know or refuse to admit it, the Kugelblitz, older
brother of the Feuerball antiradar device, is the second authentic antecedent
of the present-day flying saucers and it is with them - and with the other
German devices of the same family (spinning bombs, lenticular bombs, ramming
fighters, and flying spheres) - that the true history or, if you like, the
"pre-history" of the UFO question begins.

                            THE ANTIRADAR FEUERBALL

                            THE ANTIRADAR FEUERBALL
                             VESCO RENATO (C) 1971
                      INTERCEPT BUT DON'T SHOOT PP.85-87

With the news of the third massive appearance of the flying saucers, in 1950,
the Foo Fighters reappeared on the scene, this time cited by ufologists as
proof that Martian observers were present in the skies during the last war.

Since the idea of extraterrestrial observers clashes with the most elementary
horse sense, let us rummage about for a while among the German secrets of the
last days of the war, with special reference to that category of secrets
which, for reasons of military expedience, even today preserves in whole or in
part its shadowy and malefic character.

In the autumn of 1954, in Oberammergau in Bavaria, the O.B.F.- an experimental
center run by the Luftwaffe - had completed a series of researches into
electrical apparatuses capable of interfering with the operation of an engine
up to a maximum distance of about a hundred feet by producing intense
electromagnetic fields. If the ignition system of a plane's engine could be
short-circuited, the plane would be bound to crash. In order to make the
invention a practical proposition, the German technicians proposed to at least
triple the radius of action of this weapon, but when the conflict ended,
researches along the lines had been barely sketched out.

In the meantime, as a by-product of these researches that could be put to
immediate use in the war, another center, run by Spear and the S.S. Technical
General Staff, had adopted the idea of employing "proximity radio
interference" on the very much more delicate and hence more vulnerable
electronic apparatuses of the American night fighters.

Thus a highly original flying machine was born; it was circular and armored,
more or less resembling the shell of a tortoise, and was powered by a special
turbojet engine, also flat and circular, whose principles of operation
recalled the well-known aeolipile of Hero, which generated a great halo of
luminous flames. Hence, it was named Feuerball (Fireball).

It was unarmed and pilotless. Radio-Controlled at the moment of take-off, it
then automatically followed enemy aircraft, attracted by their exhaust flames,
and approached close enough without collision to wreck their radar gear.

The fiery halo around its perimeter-caused by very rich fuel mixture - and the
chemical additives that interrupted the flow of electricity by overionizing
the atmosphere in the vicinity of the plane, generally around the wing tips or
tail surfaces, subjected the H2S radar on the plane to the action of powerful
electrostatic fields and electromagnetic impulses (the latter generated by
large klystron radio tubes protected with special antishock and antiheat
armor) <8> Since a metal arc carrying an oscillating current of the proper
frequency - equal, that is, to the frequency used by the radar station - can
cancel the blips (return signals from the target), the Feuerball was almost
undetectable by the most powerful American radar of the time, despite its
nighttime visibility.

In addition, the builders of the device hoped - and their hopes were fulfilled
- that when the Allied flyers, not knowing their nature or purpose, noticed
that the fiery balls were apparently harmless, they would not fire on these
enormous - looking (because of their large halos of fire) "inoffensive"
devices for fear of being caught in some gigantic explosion.

More than once, in fact, as they fearfully watched those huge lights close in,
the American pilots thought that some German technician on the ground was
perhaps getting ready to push a button and cause the Foo Fighter to explode.
<9>

Project Feuerball was the first constructed at the aeronautical establishment
at Wiener Neustadt, with the help of the Flugfunk Forschungsantalt of
Oberpfaffenhoffen (F.F.O.) in so far as radio control of the missile was
concerned (but was it really a missile?).  One person who saw the first short
test flights of the device, without its electrical gear, says that "during the
day it looked like a shining disc spinning on its axis and during the night it
looked like a burning globe."

Herman Goering inspected the progress of the work a number of times, for he
hoped, as in fact it happened, that the mechanical principle could later be
used to produce an offensive weapon capable of revolutionizing the whole field
of aerial warfare.

When the Russians began to press on toward Austria, the construction of the
first Fireballs was apparently continued by a number of underground plants in
Scharzwald that were run by the Zeppelin Werkre. <11> The Klystron tubes were
supplied by the section of the forschungsanstalt der Deutchen Reichpost
(F.D.R.P.) of Aach bei Radolfzell on lake Constance, and later also by the
F.D.R.P. section of Gehlberg, whose products, however, were not as perfect as
those delivered by the F.D.R.P., a fact that caused a number of Fireballs to
be used simultaneously in formation. <12>

                          "References with synapses"
                             Renato Vesco (C)1971
                           Intercept But Don't Shoot

<8> By keeping the secret while it was still in the project stage, the name
Feuerball was also given to a ground radar apparatus constructed by  the Post
Dienstelle F of German Ministry of Posts, which was actually used in the war
- apparently in defense of the refineries of Leuna - even before the flying
mechanism was perfected.

<9> In fact, it was not an imaginary danger. The Foo fighters did contain a
strong explosive charge to destroy them in flight in case serious damage to
the automatic guidance system made it impossible for the operators to control
it. It seems, however, that during the time they were last seen, at least one
American flyer opened fire on a Foo Fighter from a safe distance without
succeeding in shooting it down, although he had it well within his sights.

A convincing detail, this especially in view of the fact that under the
armored covering of the Foo Fighter there was a thin sheet of aluminum
attached to it (but not electrically insulated) that acted as a switch.

When a bullet pierced the exterior covering, contact between the two sheets
was established and the consequent closing of the circuit (generally in a
vertical direction) caused the Foo Fighter to fly off, taking it out of the
range of further enemy fire.

<10> The F.F.O. was an important government institution in operation thirty
miles south of Munich with about eight hundred technicians conducting research
in the fields of high frequency, guided missiles, radar, infrared radiation,
and electronics in general. It was under the direction of Professor Dieckman
until the autumn of 1944 and under Dr. Ahrens afterwards.

<11> Before it was decentralized in the Schwartzwald, the Zeppelin Werke had
already done secret work in the field of radar. It had built parabolic
reflectors for ground radio position finders, attracting the attention of the
Intelligence Service and so of the R.A.F. to its Friedrichshafen factories
near the Swiss border.  (The first heavy bombing raid of sixty-four engined
Lancasters was expressly ordered by Churchill on the recommendation of the
Central Interpretation Unit Photographic Intelligence, and took place on June
20, 1943.)  The British Intelligence Objectives Sub-committee reports of
British investigation in Germany (1945-1946) on the Zeppelin Werke's
production are still classified documents.

                            Other Life Saving Uses

Other uses from this microwave technology may include weather control. That is
Dr. Fugita (Sp?) the inventor of the Tornado and Hurricane Strength Scale also
discovered that heat disrupts the formation of tornados over large cities.

Also, it has been discovered tornado's are electro-dynamos. A storm flips the
negative lighting to the more dangerous and powerful positive charge lightning
that forms these tornados.  The National Weather Service may indeed be able to
experiment on my theorems. These idea's may stop, alter, or weaken life
threatening thunderstorms.

Larger cities in Tornado Alley would support this work in that it may be a
cost effective way to save themselves.  Other Spin-Offs may even form greater
uses not foreseen today.
