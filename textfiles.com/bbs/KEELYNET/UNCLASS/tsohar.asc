       All myths are  based  at  some time on real events, and here are the
       real events:

       Let's  take  a  look at  the  Genesis  description of  the  Flood
       and  the  survival  vessel,   and  focus  our  attention  on  two
       references.   In  this  account  we  find  two  indications  that
       electricity  may have played a vital role in the operation of the
       ark.  One refrence is found in Genesis 8:6, where the Hebrew word
       "challon" or "opening" is used,  referring to the window  through
       which  Noah released the birds.   The other  reference,  however,
       utilizes  a  different  word  -tsohar-  which  is  translated  as
       "window" but does not mean window or opening at all!  Where it is
       used (22 times in the Old Testament),  its meaning is given as "a
       brightness,  a  brilliance,  the light of the noonday sun."   Its
       cognates refer to something that "glistens,  glitters or shines."

       Many  Jewish scholars of the traditonal school identify  "tsohar"
       as  "a  light which has its origins in a shining  crystal."   For
       centuries  Hebrew  tradition  has described the  "tsohar"  as  an
       enormous gem or pearl that Noah hung from the rafters of the ark,
       and which, by some power contained within itself, illuminated the
       entire vessel for the duration of the Flood voyage.

       Noah's  light  source  seems to  have  been preserved in  history
       for hundreds of years,  for we find indications that King Solomon
       of Israel may have used it in about 1000 B.C.   An Ancient Jewish
       manuscript  entitled  "The  Queen  of  Sheba  and  Her  only  Son
       Menyelek,"  translated by Sir E. A. Wallis Budge,  contains  this
       statement:  "How the House of Solomon the King was illuminated as
       by  day,  for in his wisdom he had made shining pearls which were
       like  unto  the sun,  the moon and the stars in the roof  of  his
       house."

       In  view  of this,  it  is not  surprising  that Solomon  himself
       once  wrote,  "...there is no new thing under the sun.   Is there
       anything whereof it may be said,  See, this is new?  it hath been
       already of old time which was before us." (Eccl. 1:9-10.)

       "of old time which was before us." probably refers to the ancient
       ones.   (The  ones  the were wiped out in one of  the  cataclisms
       before the Flood.)
