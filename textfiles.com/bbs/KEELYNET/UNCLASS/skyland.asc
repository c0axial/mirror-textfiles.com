                                 Lands in the Sky
                                  by Frank Patton

       Back in the  early  days of science fiction, one of the stories that
       fascinated us was one called "Island  in  the  Sky".   It told of an
       invisible island of a sort of fourth-dimensional matter where people
       lived, where there were cities, rivers, lakes, oceans.

       The hero of  the story flew his airplane too high,  and  crashed  on
       this mysterious land.   The rest of the story was very poor, but the
       concept always appealed  to  a   sense   of   conviction   hard   to
       rationalize.  Could it really be possible that such  invisible lands
       could exist?

       Years later, when  the fiction of science fiction became fact, radar
       began spotting apparently solid areas in the atmosphere that brought
       back a "hard" signal.

       An introduction to  Charles  Fort,  and  his  "New  Lands"  gave  us
       numerous queer happenings  that seemed to point to  areas  above  us
       where very physical  things  existed.   There  were  "rains of fish,
       frogs, fresh meat, ice, stone axes" and a whole host of other things
       that fell OUT OF NOWHERE.

       Somehow, the explanations of how they got up there did not satisfy -
       seemed more logical to believe they  were  up  there  in  the  first
       place, and there was no need to extrapolate an ascent.

       There were also the mysterious "hoistings" of human  beings into the
       circumambiant ether -  such  as  the  famed  and  unfortunate Oliver
       Lerch, who went out one night to get  a  pail of water, and the last
       seen of either  Oliver or the pail was his rapidly  ASCENDING  body,
       and the sound of his RECEDING voice crying out in terror.

       History seemed full of such occurences, beginning with the Bible and
       the chariot-assisted flights  of  Elijah  and  Enoch,  and  even the
       ascent of Jesus.  Was there indeed  a place of "residence" ABOVE OUR
       HEADS, where there were "many mansions"?

       Later came the totally baffling, and certainly not enough publicized

                                      Page 1





       incident of Grote  Reber,  and  his radar receiver which brought him
       intelligent signals from  an  area   which   could  only  have  been
       atmospheric and ROTATING  WITH  THE EARTH, because  his  radar  disk
       could not be focused on anything else.

       We all know  where  Mr.  Reber  wound up, heading a giant Government
       radar installation in Hawaii, where we presume he is still listening
       to intelligent signals, although we  hear  nothing of what he hears,
       not even of  the "hissing noises" it is claimed he  is  hearing  (at
       least we should have a report on the hissing!).

       Is there really   something  to  listen  to  electronically  in  the
       atmosphere that makes intelligent signals to human beings?

       When we became acquainted with Oahspe,  perhaps one of the strangest
       books we have  ever read, we discovered that it is  almost  entirely
       concerned with what  it  terms "plateaus" in the atmosphere, ranging
       from as low as 20 miles to 50,000  and  more,  each inhabited by the
       spirits of former surface dwellers who had gone to  a new life after
       death.

       Many fascinating accounts are given of these atmospheric continents,
       likewise surrounded by  watery  (or  should  we  say foggy?) oceans,
       including such things as disasters  that  cause  them to SINK to the
       surface and CONDENSE INTO DENSER MATTER; and even raising them still
       further from the  surface  in  order  to  keep the inhabitants  from
       DESCENDING to "haunt" their unsuspecting DESCENDANTS.

       As a boy,  we  had traveled much over the areas of the United States
       where the so-called glaciers had deposited  their debris.  As a boy,
       we had been brash enough to doubt that it was the glacier  which had
       done all this   piling  of  sand  and  stone  and  boulder  in  such
       fascinating layers and windows and  dunes  - it seemed more like the
       work of wind; and what a wind it must have been!

       Yet, were not the layers piled up exactly as wind would  have  piled
       them up; and had not the action of water wrought the changes in them
       that were to  be  observed, cutting into and carving out these piles
       into strange shapes?

       The geologists stuck to their ice  and  water, but it seemed to look
       like wind and  water,  to  a  mere  lad, who had studied  the  small
       example to decipher the large.

       Had, indeed, the debris of a former aerial continent fallen to earth
       in a gigantic  storm of dust, sand, pebbles and boulders, all ground
       into weird shapes, and smashed into shards by the collision of their
       falling?

       Vangard note....

            What an interesting proposition,  that  entire  other  "realms"
            exist at  heights above the earth surface.  These  most  likely
            consisting of  "attenuated"  matter  which  is governed by some
            sort of energy layer or level in which it is immersed.

            Thus, when anything from a higher level (an energy form, living
            or not) "falls" to a lower energy level (in this case, the

                                      Page 2





            surface), that  energy  manifests  as physical matter or matter
            NATURAL TO THE OVERALL BACKGROUND  (ground  state) ENERGY LEVEL
            OF THAT LAYER.

            AMAZING IDEA!

            One of the most unbelievable phenomena of fakirs and mediums is
            that of apports or materializations.  Is it possible that there
            is a  special  band of energy, accessible by  the  human  mind,
            which allows  the  creation  of  a  structure IN THAT FREQUENCY
            BAND?

            This must take place while the mind is "visiting" that layer of
            energy.  On returning to the  "physical  plane",  the  thought-
            form, now "attached" to it's creator, condenses into a physical
            form.
