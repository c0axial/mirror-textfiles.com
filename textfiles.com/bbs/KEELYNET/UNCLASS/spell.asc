       The following is  a  piece  of  dialogue  from an HBO video entitled
       "Cast a Deadly  Spell".   It  is a  tongue-in-cheek  story  about  a
       private investigator named  H.  Phillip Lovecraft  where  the  world
       freely uses magic.   He  refuses  to go along with the pack by using
       magic, despite it being a proven  means  to  success.  I thought his
       reasoning was particularly   resonant  to  the  thinking   of   many
       KeelyNetters I have had the honor of communicating with.

       When a private  investigator  was  asked  why  he  had  not achieved
       success :

       He   :  How do you expect to get out of dumps like this if you don't
               play the game?
       She  :  Dammit, Phil, everybody's gotta compromise..
       He   :  That's what I keep hearing.
       She  :  And what makes you so special?
       He   :  What makes me special is I'm  my own man, when I started out
               I said  there were things I would do and things  I  wouldn't
               do.  Lotta  guys  start  like that and a lot of 'em sell out
               along the way, but the more who fall, the easier it gets.
               See, look,   everybody   compromises,    everybody   cheats,
               everybody uses  magic,  so they empty ideals  out  of  their
               pockets and  get  down  to  the  job of sticking it to their
               neighbors before they stick  it to them.  Because that's the
               way it's done.
               To all  of which, I say NUTS!  My collar  may  be  a  little
               frayed and  maybe  I  need  a  shoeshine,  but nobodys got a
               mortgage on my soul, I own it, free and clear.
       She   : I'm not going to apologize for my life.
       He    : Didn't ask you to.
       She   : I'm happy the way things are.
       He    : Glad to hear it.
       She   : You  gotta  look ahead, you  can't  drag  around  the  past,
               there's nothing you can do about it.
       He    : Sounds like you got a real good grip on things.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       The point here  is don't sell out just to get ahead,  you  won't  be
       able to live  with yourself and you'll just have to come back and do
       it again until you get it right.   Life  fulfilled  revolves  around
       service to humanity and that can take many forms.
