       Re : Something is Coming
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       The following information is taken directly from the April issue of
       The Long Island U.F.O. Update, the monthly bulletin for the Long
       Island UFO Network.

                               THE CHAIRMAN'S CORNER
                                   BY JOHN FORD

                           SOMETHING IS COMING OUR WAY!

       In Ufology, you hear a lot of strange stories.  Some you have to
       take at face value, while others are too far fetched to believe even
       in this strange study of unusual objects and humanoid beings.  Some
       stories you mark off as holding merit, but lack supporting evidence
       to bolster their credability until a later date when something might
       surface which could prove their validity.  This is such a story.

       As yet no evidence exists to support it, yet I have a gut feeling
       that there might be something to it.  Only time will tell if the
       evidence or a coming event will prove its veracity.

       It seems that in 1987, NASA picked up the presence of a very large
       planetoid object entering our solar system near the area of Pluto.
       It was first detected by Voyager and later confirmed by telescope
       observations both radio and optical.

       The object is very large, measuring over a thousand miles in
       diameter  or  even  larger.  The  object  has  been  under  constant
       observation since.  It was last reported in the area of Jupiter.

       That last position was of January of this year.  It was observed to
       be leaving a very long ionization trail behind it.  By the way, the
       object has made at least three mid-course corrections.  That is
       peculiar for a planetoid object like an asteroid to do.  It sounds
       as if it is not what it appears to be.  It sounds like it is under
       intelligent control.

       Its orbit will bring it into Earth's orbit by late 1992 or early
       1993.  What it is, is anyone's guess.  Linda Moulton Howe has
       reported this story to us.  She had it confirmed by a Pentagon
       Military Officer.  The story relayed to her indicates that the
       Government is keeping it a secret and is tracking it through the
       auspices of the Jet Propulsion Laboratories and McDonald Douglas'
       facilities.

       The object is being tracked by the Hubble telescope and several of
       the recent infra-red telescopes recently lofted by various Space
       Shuttle Missions.  All of this concealed by public announcements
       that the missions are being deployed to photograph distant stars or
       the Sun's corona.

       The Hubble telescope doesn't work and needs to be repaired, yet it
       is pointed straight out there and can return pictures through
       computer enhancement.

       I have had the story confirmed by George Dickson and Mike Crystal,
       (Christol, my corrected spelling) both reputable U.F.O.  Researchers
       of  impeccable  reputation,  through  independent  contacts  in  the
       Scientific-Military establishment.

       The object may soon be seen by the average person as time advances.
       It may not be so easy then to conceal the truth from the public.

       Consider this too, our Moon's orbit has condensed by three thousand
       miles while the Earth's axis has tilted slightly as if pushed ever
       so gently by the invisible hand of a tremendous gravitational field.

       Have you noticed the strange weather patterns we have been having
       lately?

       U.F.O. Abductees recount their experiences with the authority
       that something very big will happen in the next several years.
       Whatever it is, they can't recall it, but they know the event will
       occur.  Is something coming our way?  Is this one of those stories
       to mark away?
