       --------------------------------------------------------------------
           The following information is intended to save you money when
                logging into KeelyNet or other Wildcat based BBSs.

       This file tells  how  to  upload pre-written messages or ANSI images
       DIRECTLY to the KeelyNet message  base.    The  idea  is  to  screen
       capture the messages you want, then hang up, write  up as detailed a
       response as you wish, then log back on and transmit your pre-written
       responses into the message base.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       The technique is quite simple.  An input string for a single line to
       be inserted in the Wildcat message base cannot exceed 72 characters.
       So, if you have a word processor, then set your parameters for

                        Top Margin = 1, Bottom Margin = 1,
                        Left Margin = 1, Right Margin = 70
                         and the Line Length should be 0.

       Then simply type  in  the  message  you  wish to send to the message
       base, and save it in ASCII format.   Next, log on to KeelyNet, go to
       the message base,

             you can either 'R' - Reply to an existing message,
             or select 'E' for Enter a new message.

       Then when the  system  comes  up  with  the  1st  line,   tell  your
       communication program to upload using the ASCII protocol.

       Type in the  name of the pre-written message you wish to send to the
       message base and watch as the message is transferred.

       When it stops, press enter (may be required a couple of times), then
       press L to list it, or E to edit  it  or  S  to  save  it if you are
       satisfied with the way it came across.  OK??

       Well, I tried it and it works OK, except if the system  exhibits any
       noise...it will be      incorporated      into      the     message.
