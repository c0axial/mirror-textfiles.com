    ³ o ³     Except for power failures, my computer has been                 ³ o ³
    ³   ³continually running since Nov. 11, 1982, and has fielded over        ³   ³
    ³ o ³12,000 telephone calls operating as a BBS.  Back then, it was        ³ o ³
    ³   ³a joy to be a part of the realm of computer telecommunications       ³   ³
    ³ o ³-- now it's a drag.                                                  ³ o ³

    ³ o ³     It seems to me that a "GIMMEE" attitude has pervaded the whole  ³ o ³
    ³   ³arena of BBSing, with callers interested in nothing more than        ³   ³
    ³ o ³material gains in the way of software or free techincal info.        ³ o ³
    ³   ³My board is far from the busiest, being isolated in the "foreign     ³   ³
    ³ o ³country" of Montana, but an average day will see about 20 or 25      ³ o ³
    ³   ³calls to the system.  An average day will also see about three       ³   ³
    ³ o ³or four messages  (of ALL types, including E-Mail) being posted.     ³ o ³






    ³   ³The typical log entry shows so-and-so logging on, going to the       ³   ³
    ³ o ³file transfer area, download-ing several files and then logging      ³ o ³
    ³   ³off.  Thanks, that's why I started up a BBS, to supply people        ³   ³
    ³ o ³with free programs.  Really makes my day to see that I've spent      ³ o ³
    ³   ³all this time and money just to watch pigs at the trough.            ³   ³

    ³   ³    Whatever happened to the COMMUNICATIONS in                       ³   ³
    ³ o ³telecommunications?  Is this the result of the Computer Age, that    ³ o ³
    ³   ³people don't talk or communicate with each other?  Are we getting    ³   ³
    ³ o ³so totally in tune with our equipment that we're excluding           ³ o ³
    ³   ³PEOPLE?  If so, then Orwell's predictions are tame in comparison     ³   ³
    ³ o ³with the reality.  Who took the BULLETIN BOARD out of Bulletin       ³ o ³
    ³   ³Board System?  The file transfer section of my board is shiny        ³   ³
    ³ o ³from daily use, but the bulletin section is obscured by cobwebs.     ³ o ³

    ³ o ³carrier!  So what?  If it's a halfway decent system, it'll           ³ o ³

    ³   ³     Who cares that the sysop climbs the walls when he sees          ³   ³
    ³ o ³someone drop carrier or time-out on the system?  Lately I've         ³ o ³

    ³   ³     Along with all the other goodies that have bitten the dust,     ³   ³
    ³ o ³there's good old APPRECIATION.  As I mentioned before, my BBS        ³ o ³
    ³   ³has fielded over 12,000 calls.  Out of all of them, I have gotten    ³   ³
    ³ o ³maybe a dozen messagessaying "Thanks for running your BBS."          ³ o ³

    ³ o ³it seems that people think they have all this automatically          ³ o ³
    ³   ³coming to them.  It's their right!  Sorry to disillusion anyone,     ³   ³
    ³ o ³but that just ain't so.  The master switch for this system is two    ³ o ³
    ³   ³feet away, and I'm not so decrepit that I can't hit it in a          ³   ³
    ³ o ³flash.  Alternatively, I can ban anyone I wish from my system.       ³ o ³
    ³   ³Callers use this BBS at my forbearance only, and it's not a          ³   ³
    ³ o ³God-given right.                                                     ³ o ³
    ³   ³     It's a sysop-given privilege!  I sincerely feel that we         ³   ³
    ³ o ³should proclaim a "Sysop Appreciation Day."  We certainly don't      ³ o ³
    ³   ³get any on a day-to-day basis!                                       ³   ³
    ³ o ³     Don't get me wrong.  There ARE joys and benefits in running     ³ o ³
    ³   ³a BBS, although sometimes in my nether moods I'm hard pressed to     ³   ³
    ³ o ³enumerate them.  But the fact is, there have been many occasions     ³ o ³
    ³   ³when I've rested my finger on the switch with the idea of going      ³   ³
    ³ o ³offline forever.                                                     ³ o ³
    ³   ³     Now for the moral of the story.  I'm only one sysop among       ³   ³
    ³ o ³many, and I'm not trying to evoke sympathy for myself through        ³ o ³
    ³   ³this article.  The point is that almost every sysop around has       ³   ³
    ³ o ³these feelings to some extent or another.  And further, most of      ³ o ³
    ³   ³these sysops (especially the best and most devoted ones) are         ³   ³
    ³ o ³going to reach a saturation point and wind up depriving the          ³ o ³
    ³   ³general public of their services.  I foresee a day coming, and       ³   ³
    ³ o ³very soon at that, when the high quality BBS's will be all gone.     ³ o ³
    ³   ³So all this is really a plea for everyone to shape up their          ³   ³
    ³ o ³     acts before it's too late.  If nothing else, when you're on     ³ o ³
    ³   ³a bulletin board, leave a little message to the sysop.  "Thanks      ³   ³
    ³ o ³for the use of your system" or "Fine BBS you have here."  Let        ³ o ³
    ³   ³them know they're appreciated.  When I see a message like that,      ³   ³
    ³ o ³I say to myself, "THAT's why I'm doing all this!"  Sysops are        ³ o ³
    ³   ³real, live human beings with feelings and emotions.  Let's start     ³   ³
    ³ o ³treating them as such!                                               ³ o ³
