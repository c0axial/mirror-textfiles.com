       This file is  included on Keelynet to show just how difficult it was
       just to live in a city in the late 1800's.

       Remember that John Keely (oure board namesake) lived in Philadelphia
       for the 30 some odd years of his researches into acoustic phenomena.

       Also remember that Tesla lived in  New  York,  which  must have been
       much worse than Philadelphia due to the larger population.

                       The truth behind the "Good Old Days"

                        LIfe 100 years ago was a NIGHTMARE!

       The "good old  days"  weren't really so good - in  fact,  they  were
       absolutely miserable, according  to  historians.  "The men and women
       of 100 years ago should be pitied, not envied," declared Dr. Otto L.
       Bettmann, author of THE GOOD OLD DAYS - THEY WERE TERRIBLE!

       The problems of   a   century  ago   included   INTENSE   POLLUTION,
       nightmarish traffic congestion,  nutritionally  poor  diet,  rampant
       disease and other woes, said Dr. Bettmann.

       "With today's city streets clogged with automobiles, the vision of
       a horse and buggy produces strong nostalgia.  But it shouldn't."

       "Runaway horses were  common.  The havoc killed thousands of people.
       According to the  National  Safety   Council,  the  horse-associated
       fatality rate was  10  times  today's  car-associated  rate.   Three
       million horses were  kept in American cities at the beginning of the
       20th century, and each horse produced about 25 pounds of MANURE EACH
       DAY.

       Swarms of flies abounded, and stables  on  every  block  filled with
       URINE-SATURATED HAY added to the stench.

       Food was terrible,  too,  Dr.  Bettmann added.  "Food  was  tampered
       with.  For example,  to  improve  the  color  of  milk from diseased
       cattle, they frequently ADDED PLASTER OF PARIS.

       "Bakers preserved their dough with  doses  of  alum  and  sulphur of
       copper.  Customers were  continually enraged to discover  CHUNKS  OF
       FOREIGN MATTER in their loaves, such as oven ash and grit."

       Dwellings were substandard and domestic chores difficult, he added.

       "Almost no homes had running water, so people SELDON BATHED. Cooking
       was a monumental  task.   And laundry was physically punishing labor
       because no washing machines or 'miracle' detergents existed."

       "Apartment houses were often dismal - with vile privies, dirt-filled
       sinks, slop oozing down stairwells  and  plumbing  pipes  pockmarked
       with holes that emitted foul, flammable sewer gases.   The threat of
       diphtheria, smallpox, typhoid and yellow fever was widespread."

       Concluded Dr. Bettmann;  "Compared  to  the people of 100 years ago,
       we're very, very lucky!"
