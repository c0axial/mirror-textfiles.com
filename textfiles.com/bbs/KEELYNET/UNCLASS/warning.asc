WARNING!  WARNING!  WARNING!  WARNING!  WARNING!  WARNING!  WARNING!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a file being circulated on BBS's called PKZ120.ZIP or
PKZ120.EXE or similar, and that claims to be version 1.20 of
PKZIP but in fact is a hacked version of PKZIP 1.10.

As of the date of this writing, the latest version of PKZIP is
version 1.10.  Furthermore, due to this intentional act of
vandalism, PKWARE will not release any versions of PKZIP in the
future with the version 1.20.

on-line system, please ask the SysOp of that system to remove
the files IMMEDIATELY, and please contact PKWARE to report
where the files were seen.

community, and the perpetrators of this crime are at minimum in
