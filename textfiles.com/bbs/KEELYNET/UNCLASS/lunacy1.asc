                  Stabilizing our Weather by Destroying the Moon

       A University professor  has  a  moonstruck  solution  to the Earth's
       weather problems.  He wants to blow  up  the moon - or at least send
       it somewhere else.

       "It's the only way to rid the world of scorching deserts  and  artic
       winters," says Professor  Alexander  Abian,  a  mathematician at the
       University of Iowa.  He claims that  by getting rid of the moon, the
       Earth will then be able to shift into a "more desirable orbit."

       The suggestion which has been greeted with hoots  and  hollers  from
       the world's scientific  community, has been presented by the 65-year
       old Armenian-born expert to the American government.

       Abian suggests strategically placed  hydrogen  bombs  on the Earth's
       satellite can either blow it apart, or send it careening  into outer
       space, maybe even  into  the  sun.  It all depends where you put the
       charges, he says.

       "We've been held hostage by the moon  for 5 million years, and we've
       been subjected to violent extremes in weather, not  to  mention that
       the planet is slowly becoming a desert.

       "It's time for  a  change."   The change would make our weather less
       extreme, turn our deserts into fertile farm land, and make the north
       and south polar regions livable.

       But other scientists disagree, suggesting  the  professor  might  be
       moonstruck.  "If you lose the moon, you LOSE THE TIDES.   And if you
       melt the polar  caps,  you're  going  to flood the seacosts of every
       continent," one scientist explains.

       Another climate expert says blowing  up  the  moon  would turn Earth
       into "a bleak, seasonless planet, not to mention  the  fact  that we
       would lose the tides."

       British astronomer Patrick  Moore  suggests Professor Abian "must be
       as nutty as several fruitcakes."

       Famed romance writer  Barbara  Cartland  offers  the  best  argument
       against Abian's plan.  Without moonlight, she says,  love would flee
       the Earth.  "People  long  for  romance  and  no professor should be
       allowed to rob them of it," she says.

       Vangard notes...

            Just for speculation......

            What a  bizarre  theory!   Since  the moon causes the tides and
            plays a definite part in helping  to  keep  the  Earth  in  its
            elliptical orbit around our Sun, the removal  of  the  moon, by
            whatever means,  would  lead  to a radical stabilization of our
            orbit, into the most stable natural form, that of the circle.

            Now without the change in distance  from the current elliptical
            orbit of  Earth  around  the Sun, we would NOT  experience  the
            heating and cooling cycles which result in summer, fall, winter
            and spring.

            In addition,  the  lack  of  tides  would  greatly  change  the
            characteristics of large bodies of water such as our oceans.

            The most scary thing about such  a  proposal  is that we do not
            know just how far the Earth would naturally locate  itself from
            the Sun.   This  would determine what the climate would be like
            everyday from the point of stabilization on.

            Too close and we would experience perpetual summer, too far and
            we could experience another ice  age.   How would we CONTROL it
            to arrive at the most desirable location.
