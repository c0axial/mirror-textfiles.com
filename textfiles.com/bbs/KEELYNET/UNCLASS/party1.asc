                        How to throw a 90's Party!

         Parties are  not what they used to be.  Nowadays, people hang
    out, eat broccoli washed down with  designer  water and talk about
    their work.

         In the past, people got their kicks from parties which relied
    on excessive consumption of alcohol and drugs.  Not to mention the
    intimate liasons with  friends  or  strangers that  continue  past
    sunrise.

         But with  those activities in disrepute, primarily because of
    health concerns, parties are changing.

         People are getting their stimulus  in  different  ways : from
    conversation, from entertainment,  from  games and  from  dessert,
    which may be  the only decadent pleasure that can still be enjoyed
    without profuse apology.

         Dessert is what people now hang around for.  Few people these
    days do drugs or drink at parties.   Even  on  New  Year's, people
    drink Perrier and talk.

         People of  all ages say their friends are drinking  less  and
    generally shunning drugs.  Whether in their 20s or their 50s, they
    usually sigh and say it must be because they are getting old.

         Many people have "turned down the volume" on their appetites,
    but they still lust for a variety of experiences that will provide
    stimulation.

         As people  get  to know each other on a more intellectual and
    private level, they  find  a different  perspective  arising  from
    simple conversation.  The turnon is from being around  people  who
    interest you.  A  good  host  today  will  invite  people  who are
    stimulating by having wide interests.   Partygoers  say  they find
    the interactions more personal now.

         When the talking trails off, there is food.  Chocolate seem
    to be the  dessert  of choice.  Dr. Howard Shaffer,  head  of  the
    Center for Addiction  Studies  at the Harvard Medical School, says
    there is no  biochemical reason  that  desserts  would  especially
    appeal to people who have cut down on drinking.   But he says that
    "eating often reduces anxiety."

         Many partygoers  say  today's events are not boring: they are
    just civilized.  Today, cocktail  party  guests mingle, talk, then
    pair up to go out to dinner.

         People still  drink,  but not to get drunk, most  people  are
    beginning to understand   that   they   simply   don't   need  the
    aftereffects.

         More people  are hiring entertainers  for  parties,  even  in
    their homes.  Psychics, comedians and magicians are also hired for
    entertainment.

    Gee, just think  what all these people have been missing all these
    years.  I have been attending seminars  all  over  the country and
    have met some very interesting people.

         Parties are  not boring if you can get people  interested  in
    science, history or  politics.  The  only  reason that people find
    that parties are boring is that they  never  study or take part in
    community affairs. So they have nothing to keep their minds
    busy which results in polluting it with drugs and drinking.
