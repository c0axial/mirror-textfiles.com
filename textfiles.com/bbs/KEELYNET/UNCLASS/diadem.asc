  A bit of  curiosa  from  the  April  11,  1896  Scientific American.  We at
  KeelyNet agree with the contentions in  the  document  CANYON1 that many of
  our "institutions" are  suppressing  or  otherwise  hiding  discoveries  or
  information relating to our past for reasons unknown.  This is something we
  came across that  could be a hoax, yet is worth investigating if anyone out
  there in cyberland has the resources or contacts to check it out.  We would
  appreciate feedback on this since it originated at KeelyNet.

  I don't have the time to show a before  and  after image of the Sphinx WITH
  such a Diadem ATTACHED, so if anyone out there can work  up  such  a set of
  images, I'd be  most  grateful  if  you'd  let  us add them to the file for
  others to study......................................Thanks...>>>  Jerry

                     An Interesting Archeological Discovery

  We have received the following letter  from Mr. George E. Raum, late of San
  Francisco:
                                           Cairo, Egypt, February 29, 1896

  To the Editor of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN :

    Dear Sir:  I enclose a rough sketch of a portion of the rock crown of the
  Sphinx found by  me.   This portion of the stone crown  or  diadem  of  the
  Sphinx was found  at  the  bottom  of  the temple, between the forepaws, on
  February 26, 1896.  Originally this stone  crown was in all probability ten
  feet broad and  as  high again, with a stone stem seven  feet  long,  which
  fitted into the perpendicular hole in its head, to hold it on.  We now know
  how the Sphinx originally looked.
                                                Yours Truly, GEORGE E. RAUM
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This discovery of  Col.  Raum is of great interest, though the statement of
  the find has  been  received  with  incredulity   in  some  quarters.   The
  arguments of the  gentlement  who  are  inclined  to  disbelieve   in   the
  authenticity of the stone found are NOT convincing, being principally based
  on the fact  that the temple has been excavated by several modern explorers
  - Caviglia, Mariette, and M. Maspero.

  Again, others state that "it is not usual to hear of holes 'drilled' by the
  ancients in their monuments," but the  Egyptians  worked  hard  stones with
  bronze saws set  with corundum or diamonds, and for tubular  drilling  they
  had tools like  our  modern  diamond  rock drills (see Engineering, XXXVII,
  page 282).

  Another point which has been made is that  there are THREE LOTUS COLUMNS on
  the cap.  This   is  more  reasonable  criticism  and   may   possibly   be
  satisfactorily explained.  The  fallibility of Egyptologists is well known,
  but until some really convincing proof  is  brought forward, IT IS PROBABLY
  SAFE TO BELIEVE  that  the marked stone found by Mr. Raum  is  the  cap  or
  diadem of the Sphinx.

  The Egyptian Sphinx  was  usually  an emblematic figure representative of a
  king, and may be considered, when with  the head of a man and the body of a
  lion, as the union of intellect and physical force.

  The Great Pyramid of Sphinx lies about 1,800 feet southeast  of  the  Great
  Pyramid of Gizeh.   It is a recumbent androsphinx, or man-headed lion, hewn
  out of a natural eminence in the solid  rock.   Owing to certain defects in
  the rock, these faults were remedied by a partial stone  casing,  the  legs
  being likewise added.

  The addition of these pieces militates against the argument that the cap so
  recently found could  not have belonged to the Sphinx, as it did not form a
  part of the  solid rock.  An excellent  idea  of  this  hoary  monument  of
  antiquity may be  obtained  from  the engraving in the SCIENTIFIC  AMERICAN
  SUPPLEMENT, No. 864.   The Sphinx has been variously measured.  The figures
  given by Mr. E. L. Wilson are length,  155  feet;  height from the base, 63
  feet.

  Between the paws is a temple (?) which speedily fills up  with  sand  after
  being excavated.  It  is considered that the Sphinx is older than the Great
  Pyramid.  Various interpretations have  been given to this boldy sculptured
  figure which rises out of the waste of sands.  Cambyses mutilated  the face
  of the Sphinx, and it may have been at this time that it LOST ITS CAP.

  The brow of the Sphinx is nearly 14 feet broad; so the cap, which is 4 feet
  6 inches long  at  the  bottom, probably only formed the tip of the cap, as
  stated by Mr.  Raum.  Col. Raum obtained  permission  to  excavate  in  and
  around the Pyramids and Sphinx from the Egyptian government.   He came upon
  the cap at  a  depth  of  fourteen or fifteen feet below the surface in the
  temple (?) between the forepaws.

  The stone is  painted red in the decorations,  as  was  in  order,  as  the
  countenance of the Sphinx was ORIGINALLY OF A REDDISH HUE.

  The cap is irregular in shape, measuring 2 feet 2 inches  at  the top and 4
  feet 6 inches  at  the  bottom;  on  the left side, from top to bottom.  It
  measures 2 feet 8 inches.  The left side has a conventional decoration.

  In the center are three lotus columns  and  a  fish, on the right side is a
  portion of the sun's disk.  The wonderful discoveries conducted  by  Mr. L.
  De Morgan, at  Dahshur,  Egypt,  are  described in the current issue of the
  SUPPLEMENT.  The tomb of Queen Khnemit  was unearthed by the discoverer and
  a beautiful golden crown and other ornaments of elaborate  workmanship were
  found.
