       Hi Jerry,

       I re-read the AURAVIEW file, to get a better idea of how to vitalize
       the aura and   thereby  the  Chakras.   Remembering  some  old  Rife
       information, I connected a copper  plate to the Tesla secondary, and
       placed my feet  on it.  At first the Tesla reacted wildly,  dropping
       in and out of resonance, but after a few minutes, it settled down to
       a steady hum, which varied only slightly with breathing.

       At this point, I felt a definitely pleasant sensation up through the
       chest and neck.   I  turned  it off, and a few minutes later, felt a
       very pleasant facial flush.

       I waited a while, and tried it again.   The  Tesla  "tuned  in" much
       more quickly, and the chest/neck sensation did not  occur.  However,
       the flush did occur, after a few minutes as before.

       This may be  the  only  way that a "westerner", without the cultural
       disposition for hours of meditation,  can recharge his/her aura.  In
       any event, I asked my wife to try this experiment,  and although she
       did not feel the tingling sensation, she did feel the flush.

       I might add  that  the copper plate was isolated from the floor, and
       we both took turns sitting in a plastic  (insulative) chair.  I KNOW
       that I feel stronger, because I'm recovering from a  severe reaction
       to a spider  bite, (three shots and two prescriptions yesterday) and
       I can feel more strength than before.

       I know that  you have also experienced  the  Tesla  "tune  up",  and
       wondered if you  felt  the flush, or noticed any more  energy  as  a
       result.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       This is a  message, but wanted to write it offline so as to cut down
       on the typos and to allow more time  for  thought  between words.  I
       KNOW that assumes ANY thought is occurring, but bear with me.

       I spoke with Mary Hardy today, (listed in CONTACT1)  and  ordered  a
       copy of their  book.   She  spoke  of Chakras, and the fact that the
       Bible in Revelations states that  the  earth  will  undergo a change
       from a system of seven to a system of twelve.

       This is what she attributes to the polar shift and resulting lack of

                                      Page 1





       balance.  It was  prophesied,  along  with the "groaning".  When the
       earth develops 12 main grid Chakras,  it  would  follow (my opinion)
       that people would have to do so as well, or be out-of-balance  here.
       That certainly would result in a higher order of human, as well as a
       new "world order".  End of opinion.

       In any event, the number of grids, which are the stabilizers of this
       planet, are going  to  increase.   I  can't  imagine  this happening
       without some major  ecological,  meteorological   and  seismological
       events occurring, also BTW prophesied.

       Mary said that  the more people who used positive  energy,  call  it
       Telluric, Orgone or  whatever,  the  sooner  the  balance  would  be
       restored.  I would guess that using  this  energy,  which  is coming
       from the earth, would help to balance a person to whatever number of
       earth Chakras exist.  And since we all affect each  other, we spread
       the balance.

       She says that  our  solar system is entering a photon belt, which is
       2000 years wide, and which will "accelerate  everything".  This will
       eventually restore the balance, although the poles  will  not  shift
       back to their old positions.  At that point, she was so far ahead of
       me that she  said  to  read  the  book and call back with questions,
       which I will do.

       In the meantime, I was wondering what the "Decker Interpretation" is
       to these concepts.  Nothing is ever  proven  until  it  happens, and
       even then most people will ignore it if it doesn't  fit their belief
       system.  However, I  know  you  to  be  both  knowledgable and open-
       minded, so your opinions are greatly appreciated.

       Another thought.  Since the south  pole of a magnet induces healing,
       then perhaps the  Telluric  energy  being  attracted,   which  would
       strengthen the Chakras, is biased north, at least north of the major
       grid lines.  If  you  want  to  share  this  message with any fellow
       travelers, be my guest.
                                                          Thank you,
                                                          Joel

       Hi Joel!

       And thanks for the interesting comments  regarding  your  discussion
       with Mary Hardy.    (also   for   the   blurb   about    openminded,
       etc...probably TOO openminded...<g>)

       But you do raise some interesting points.  The Indians have a belief
       in a global  energy  grid  which they call the "Spider Woman."  This
       has been proven with the Russian studies that show the magnetic grid
       of the planet.  Guess that is worth a file for future correlations.

       However, the idea is that our entire solar system, if not our galaxy
       is continually moving through space.  Energy has pockets where it is
       "thin" or "thick"....that   is,   high   density   energy,   usually
       associated with higher  frequencies because of the  relationship  of
       frequency to power.

       So, we are  moving  into  one of these high energy pockets that will
       help to evolve all life on Earth.   If  matter  is  crystallized  or
       slowed down energy, then this very crystallization will allow matter

                                      Page 2





       to go just  so low on the scale.  This because it can only go to the
       ground state or reference associated  with  the  background  medium,
       i.e. space energy during its crystallization or aggregation process.

       When energy density  increases, so too does the "matrix"  caused  by
       the compaction of  frequencies, thus, the reason for the jump from 7
       to 12 main grids.  And these main  grids  could  be  thought  of  as
       Chakras, i.e. energy centers.  As you pointed out  in  OPENMIND,  it
       all does kind of come together, eh?

       You have no  doubt  heard  of  the  8th Chakra?  In humans there are
       supposed to be 7.  This new one is  said to be located in the region
       about equivalent to the thymus gland.  I think the  claim is that it
       only occurs in  those  who  are  "ready",  (read advanced enough) to
       easily function on the higher levels  associated  with  this  energy
       shift.  I guess  you  could say dimensional shift,  because  as  the
       density increases, it  follows  that  the number of dimensions would
       also increase.

       An interesting correlation is to the  free  energy claims associated
       with the Sweet device...i.e. that of LOCALE DEPENDENCE.  The machine
       seems to be sensitive to where it is located.  In some  areas  there
       is higher power  output.   Thus  confirming  (in  a  pseudo  science
       anecdotal kind of fashion) the presence  of  these pockets of higher
       or lower energy densities.

       A bizarre correlation is to one which claims that long  ago,  humans
       had "powers" associated  with  the  energy  levels of the Earth.  At
       that time, the Pineal was very "pumped  up"  allowing  us to see and
       manipulate by mind force, energies and patterns that  could  be used
       to produce "magical" effects.

       In the fascinating  book,  Dweller  on Two Planets, there is a story
       about a race of people who did no physical labor, yet always had all
       that they needed.  They were called  the  Suern  and  at the time of
       their existence, lived in India or thereabouts.

       These people were always frowning and in a perpetual  bad mood.  The
       reason was because  they  were always concentrating to perfect their
       will.  They understood  that  WILL   was   how   energy   could   be
       manipulated.  That too follows as do we not control  all  our  limbs
       through WILL-FORCE?

       And would it   not   be  possible  to  EXTEND  this  will  force  to
       "inanimate" matter to cause it to  behave according to the intensity
       of our will?  With the proper high density energy medium,  would  it
       not be THAT  much  easier  to  effect  such  remote  mind controlled
       actions on other objects or forces?  And does not E=MC^ show that we
       could manifest matter  from  energy  or  redirect  energy  flows  to
       fulfill our desires   should   our  brain  transistors   be   biased
       sufficiently high?

       In the book,  these  people simply sat down for a meal, PRAYED (read
       intense concentration on a specific  desire) for what they wanted to
       eat and whoosh, it appeared before them!  The powers listed for them
       were miraculous, including  being able to walk among  their  enemies
       invisible to them, being able to kill with a glance, to walk through
       walls, to communicate with others simply by concentration, to


                                      Page 3





       transport themselves or   matter   from  one  point  to  another  by
       concentration, etc..

       When they displeased  their emporer,  a  Son  of  the  Solitude,  he
       WITHDREW THE ENERGY from the local medium of THEIR  COUNTRY  to such
       an extent that  no  one  could  use  their  mind  force  for  mental
       manipulation to fulfill their desires.   I  probably  misstate  this
       "withdrawing" of energy   and   should  instead  use   the   phrase,
       "relocate" the energy  to  another region.  This of course fits with
       phasing principles for  the  increase   or  decrease  of  energy  by
       harmonic/enharmonic frequencies.

       Why do I bother with such drivel?  Because there are  many  clues in
       this particular book (as well as others of a suspicious nature..<g>)
       and the tie-in  with  your  letter indicates a possible correlation.
       What if the background energy DOES increase?  Would we suddenly find
       that intense concentration on a given  desire might PRODUCE TANGIBLE
       RESULTS.....whoopeee, we're in!  No more work!

       Of course, only those who could achieve high levels of concentration
       would have such  abilities  but  wouldn't it be fun  for  those  who
       could?  And that in turn ties in with the hyperspace concept....when
       you imagine something,  you  create  that pattern in a mental matrix
       residing in hyperspace.

       By providing a sustained thought  on  that  particular  pattern, you
       enhance the energy flowing into the pattern and it will "pop" into 3
       space as a real object or event.  After all, does not energy
       convert to mass  and  vice  versa?   Now  if that energy  level  was
       intensified, the time  required to sustain the pattern would be less
       and so the manifestation would occur that much faster.

       Would we see  a  reappearance of  fairies  (not  that  kind),  earth
       sprites, gnomes, leprechauns, satyrs, unicorns, and  all those other
       "mythical" creatures?  Would  not  magic  become  the  standard?   I
       suggest you see a movie called "Cast a Deadly Spell" with H. Phillip
       Lovecraft played by Fred Ward and  Connie  Stone  played by Julianne
       Moore, to see what such a world would be like.  I found  it  offered
       some interesting observations of the complexities of such a world.

       As to your  experiments  working  with  a  Tesla  coil as a physical
       exciter, it reminded me of a file  I  wrote  last year and failed to
       place online (ELECLEAN) but which I placed online tonite.   The rush
       you get from  the  coil  stimulation  is primarily from sniffing the
       ozone produced by the sparks.  However,  I  think there is something
       else as it is an EXCELLENT HIGH that I felt, as did  Chuck  and  Ron
       when they stood on it.

       The resonant frequency of a human body is supposed to be around 6MHZ
       measured by no  less  than  Bell  Labs.   There  are  numerous other
       measurements, primarily those by  Itzhak  Bentov,  but  I don't have
       them handy for  this paper.   Whole body excitation  should  involve
       frequencies much lower than the megahertz region.

       Well, enough for now, and THANKS for the conversation!
