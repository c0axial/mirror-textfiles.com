              The following is part of an article on page 160 to 162 of the
              April 13,  1990 issue of Science Magazine by Joseph Palca. It
              tells a little of the history  of  BBSes  or maybe some other
              kinds of  BBSs  -  the  type  done  by  institutions  between
              minicomputers and mainframes and more:

           ...The idea for a computer network was born in the 196O's at the
       RAND corporation, and  realized  late  in  that decade by ARPANET, a
       network supported by the Defense Advanced  Projects  Research Agency
       (DARPA - later  known  for  the  advocacy of Star Wars  among  other
       technological state of the art projects).

           Despite the  Pentagon's  financial support, ARPANET was a fairly
       open environment: pretty  much anyone  who  wanted  to  get  on  the
       network could do so.

               "The notion when ARPANET was established  was  that  it  was
                primarily to share computing resources,"

       says Douglas E.   Van   Houweling,   Vice  Provost  for  Information
       Technology at the University of Michigan.

               "As things turned out that  wasn't  the way it got used.  It
                got used  by  human beings who wanted to  work  with  other
                human beings."

           In the  197O's  a  whole  variety  of networks joined ARPANET to
       offer connectivity.  Some were regional--like  Merit in Michigan and
       BARRNET in the  San  Francisco  Bay  Area--linking   government  and
       academic institutions together.

           Others were  national,  like  BITNET  and  CSNET,  which offered
       nationwide services to academic institutions  as well as connections
       to other countries.  Federal agencies like the National  Aeronautics
       and Space Administration  and  the Department of Energy set up their
       own networks.

           Missing in all of this was the  sense  of  a national framework.
       Then, in the  early 198O's, the National Science Foundation  entered
       the scene with NSFNET.

           Designed around  the  six  NSF-supported  supercomputer centers,
       NSFNET was intended to form a high-speed  backbone  for  a  national
       network, linking together  not only the supercomputer  installations
       but also the  regional  networks  that  had  sprung  up  around  the
       country.

           In 1987,  NSF  awarded a 5-year contract to a consortium of IBM,
       MCI Communications Corporation, and  the  Merit  Computer Network to
       operate and upgrade the NSFNET backbone.

           When the Merit consortium took over, the backbone operated at 56
       kilobits per second.  Today those lines have been  upgraded  to  1.5
       million bits per  second,  and  later  this  year  portions  of  the
       backbone will be improved to 45 million bits per second.

           The appetite of researchers for these facilities has proved
       voracious.  Network traffic  is most  easily  measured  in  packets,
       discreet packages of bits that contain address information  and some
       fraction of the particular message being sent.

           In 1988,  just over 100 million packets per month were traveling
       across the network.  In February of  this  year, the network carried
       2.5 billion packets.  And the numbers have been growinftaS-g  by  an
       average of 20% per month.

               "In the last month, 10% of all the information that has ever
                been sent,  was  sent,"  says  [Paul]  Huray.   "That's  an
                incredible statement."

                       They are apparently sending graphics.

           They also get things like data  from  an  ultrahigh energy gamma
       ray detector in Utah. Or medical files in another city. Or operating
       a telescope in California from Maryland.

           And it  says: "..literally thousands of scientists  start  their
       day in the  United  States,  and  increasingly  around the world, by
       reading mail sent by their colleagues.

           Even for relatively low speed  networks,  people  get  hooked on
       electronic mail because, as Michael M Connors, director of Computing
       Systems at IBM says, "it beats the soles off the U.S.  Post Office."

          [I would say it is also easier to write and send - no looking for
           envelopes and  stamps  and  no  printing  out and  tearing  away
           perforations and  access to previous mail and instant answer and
           so on. (maybe that is why the Post Office nickname is US SNAIL)]

          It also says

           "Getting an exact fix on who is using the network is difficult
       because of the way the network cultures  have evolved: it is against
       the unwritten rules  of network protocol to see what  is  inside  an
       individual packet. But  just  like  the post office can tell where a
       letter is going without knowing what's inside, network operators can
       group packets into  certain general  categories  by  information  in
       their address fields.

           Approximately 30%  carry  electronic  mail  from   one  user  to
       another, and about  the  same  amount  are  transmitting files among
       users.  Another 2O%   fall  under   the   heading   of   interactive
       applications which include things like using the network  to work on
       a computer at  a  different  installation.   And 15% are taken up by
       directory inquiries. (?)

           These are  also  used  of course for research and a mathematical
       problem was recently solved very quickly  this way. {See the Science
       section of the Tuesday June 26,1990 New York Times  also  listing on
       Keelynet as PROBNET at 214-324-3501}.

           Of course  that  depends  if  it  is a field in which people are
       allowed to acknowledge and use progress.  In the medical it probably
       wouldn't make much of a difference.   Everything  must  go through a
       gradual series of tests and no one is allowed to use their brain.

       Vangard notes...

            Of course, we know the value of the computer  as  a  networking
            tool, although  we  at  KeelyNet  don't  at  present  support a
            Conference, perhaps  we  should  open  up  one  or  more  as  a
            communication tool for our users.

            Our earlier version had one on Gravity, one  on  Biology  and a
            third on Ecology, we shut them down after they our first system
            crash and never opened them back up.  Let us know if you'd like
            such a service.  Thanks....Jerry/Ron....Sysops - KeelyNet
