Can sound be captured as vibrations in paint?  Some threads from Usenet.

Here's a copy of the post that I made to sci.archaeology on this subject. The
thread didn't get a very scientific reception there but maybe it will do
better here. It was posted on or near April Fools day and that didn't help.

Anyone out there with a background in real physics (I'm a broadcast audio
engineer.) have a good contribution that doesn't require big maths. (i.e.
numbers over 10 or any letters :-))

I haven't seen any of the papers on this so I'll not condem it outright, I
would have written an "April Fool" posting if I had not heard some mention of
this before. Some things puzzle me and IMHO it's not possible, here goes:

The first big problem is this "frame vibrating like a microphone". The
vibration of a picture is never going to be linear in any sense, it would be
all over the place, and any vibration that would be induced by someone
speaking is not going to be enough to cause modulation in something like
canvas. I know that it is possible to use a laser interferometer to de-
modulate speech from a glass window or mirror, a trick the police/secret
services etc. are prone to use. However for starters glass is very, very rigid
and so it is probably quite linear or at least predictable in it's response to
audio, secondly laser interferometery is accurate enough to measure the growth
of a plant in any given second. It isn't some stylus being rubbed against a
bit of paint.

The next big problem is with the paint. Pour some paint out and shout at it
hard as you like, you'll not make a permanent imprint on it. If you blow on it
you might make a ripple, or a wave or even a bit of a depression but it will
not hang about for long. Even assuming that the artist in question was putting
the paint on pretty dry it's not going to hold a shape.

Then the artist. What are the chances that as he made the brush stroke he
maintained a steady speed? Let's assume that he makes a stroke 1 foot long and
that (despite what I've shown) there is a way to modulate the paint. Then lets
assume that the paint knows to modulate from left to right (say) as the artist
makes the stroke, and that he says the word "blue" at exactly the moment he
starts the stroke. We now have a line of paint which contains modulation which
is not linear in relation to time. Maybe he was faster at the start, slower in
the middle and then faster at the end again. So how are we going to decode
that little lot? This is like the backwards messages on records which are
supposed to have appeared as a by product of the recording process (i.e. they
were not placed there by the artist but appeared by accident.) play almost any
record backwards, at varying speeds enough times while thinking "BLUE" to
yourself and I'll bet that by a miracle, sure enough, large as life the artist
has recorded the word "blue" backwards on his record.

My last point is that unless the paint dries infinitely quickly then (Even if
modulation were possible.) it is just going to be modulated by the last wave
form it 'hears' before it dries, if the artist says:

B-L-U-E     (and then nothing else until the paint dries.)

Then the only sound encoded is going to be the very end of the 'E' as it will
(Not that this is possible) cause the canvas to vibrate and this will modulate
the whole paint stroke.

Think of a tape machine, it applies record bias to the tape so the audio
signal is recorded in the linear range of the tape.

The physical characteristics of the tape remain constant, the magnetic
particles don't all slide about and jumble up after the recording is made.

The tape moves past the record heads of the tape machine at a constant, fixed
speed.

The machine does not go back and record over material which it has just
recorded.

I'll be interested in what everyone else thinks.

Philip Blair.

Sorry, but I simply cannot believe this.

True - the canvas would vibrate as the artist painted, but these vibrations
are likely to dissapear in a matter of a second or two, whereas the paint
would take around an hour or two to dry.

To imply that the 'sound' of the painting is somehow captured in the dried
paint is misleading.

Hmm, I wonder.  The canvas would be "driven" by the ambient sound, much as the
diaphram of a microphone.  If the paint were thick, as a paste, then it would
tend to retain modulation, as does a wax cylinder phonograph.  The paint brush
strokes are analogous to the phonograph needle.  I believe oil paints are
thick and retain their texture as they dry, this being one of their
advantages.

An interesting subject, it leads one's mind to wander.  Imagine being able to
hear Leonardo Da Vinci burp as he painted the Mona Lisa!

And given modern laser technology, I would imagine there are better ways to
play a painting than dragging a phonograph needle over it.
