                         Notes and Quotations on Thinking

                                        by

                              Richard L. Clark, Ph.D.

       Before going into very controversial subjects that are contrary to
       currently held fixed opinions, vested financial, academic and social
       interests and personal emotional prejudices, it is necessary to
       remind the reader that thinking requires care in application and an
       open attitude of judgement.

       Edward de Bono made several valuable contributions to the knowledge
       of human thought processes.  Two inherent limitations of the data
       processing (thinking) in humans, is the sequence or step method used
       and the self organizing storage of mental data by the brain system.

          There are two aspects of this inherent limitation in the handling
          of information by a self organizing memory surface.  The first
          aspect is the necessity to preceed by steps which can only
          reflect experience, which may be first or secondhand.

          Abstractions  or  combinations  of  separate  experiences  are
          possible, but they remain experience dominated.  The collection
          of  new  information  is  also  experience  dominated  since  new
          information is only selected if it fits in with existing patterns
          -- relevance is all important......

       Arrogance in thinking does prevent the emergence of new ideas, to
       paraphrase de Bono.

          The third basic principle of lateral thinking is the realization
          that vertical thinking by its very nature is not only ineffective
          in generating new ideas, but also positively inhabiting.  There
          is an extreme type of temperament which compulsively seeks for
          tight control of what goes on in the mind; everything has to be
          logically analyzed and synthesized.    ...This is an extreme type
          of mind, but there are a great number of minds which show
          this inclination to lesser degrees.

       Dr. James L. Adams, Director of the Design Division of the Stanford
       School of Engineering, teaches thinking as opposed to reacting.

          Cultural blocks are acquired by exposure to a given set of
          cultural patterns.

          ...Some examples of cultural blocks are:

          o  Fantasy and reflection are a waste of time, lazy even
             crazy.

          o  Playfulness is for children only.

          o  Problem solving is a serious business and humor is out
             of place.

          o  Reason, logic numbers, utility and practicality are
             good;  feeling, intuition, qualitative judgements, and
             pleasure are bad.

          o  Tradition is preferable to change.

          o   Any problem can be solved by scientific thinking and
              lots of money.

       Returning to the work of de Bono on why human thinking "locks up" in
       most people, let us look at dominant ideas and crucial factors.

          Everyone is confidant that they know what they are talking about,
          reading about or writing about but if you ask them to pick out
          the dominant idea, there is difficulty in doing so.  It is
          difficult to convert a vague awareness into a definite statement.

          Unless one can pick out the dominant idea, one is going to be
          dominated by it.  The dominate idea resides not in the situation
          itself but in the way it is looked at.  A crucial factor is some
          element of the situation which must always be included no matter
          how one looks at the situation.  Like a dominate idea, a crucial
          factor can immobilize a situation and make it impossible to shift
          a point of view.

       This leads into the area of concepts, divisions, and polarizations
       as covered by de Bono.

          A limited and coherent attention span arises directly from the
          mechanics of the self maximizing memory surface that is mind.
          This limited attention span means that one only reacts to a bit
          of the total environment.  Separation into units, selection of
          units, and combination of units in different ways together,
          provide a very powerful information processing system.  When a
          unit is obtained by dividing up the total situation or by putting
          together other units, it establishes it as a pattern in its own
          right instead of just being part of another pattern.  The named
          assemblies of units (which are called concepts) are even more
          restricting because they impose a rigid way of looking at a
          situation.  The dangers of the polarizing tendency may now be
          summarized:  Once established, the categories become permanent.
          New  information  is  altered  so  that  it  fits  an established
          category.  Once it has done so, there is no indication that it is
          any different from anything else under that category.  The fewer
          the categories the greater the degree of shift.

       Oakley  worked  out  the  theory  of  man's  thought  evolution  and
       development based on a generic meaning of Man the Tool Maker.  His
       balance  point  was  between  tradition  and  invention  in social
       groupings.

          Human culture in all its diversity is the outcome of this
          capacity for conceptual thinking, but the leading factors in its
          development are tradition coupled with invention.

          Imagination, observation, deduction, and speculation ultimately
          led to art, science and religion, but at first these were
          scarcely separable from each other.

       Immanuel  Velikovsky  wrote  the  most  controversial  book  of this
       century -- Worlds in Collision.  His comments on thinking and
       reality vs. "law" is interesting.

          If,  occasionally,  historical  evidence  does  not  square  with
          formulated laws, it should be remembered that a law is but a
          deduction from experience and experiment, and therefore laws must
          conform with historical facts, not facts with laws.

       And finally, let us look at the reception of anything that is new,
       controversial or different in general terms.

          N.I.H...is a technological slang acronym for Not Invented Here.
          The very existence of such a phrase in the jargon of technology
          attests to its ubiquity.  The NIH reaction is as common as the
          gravel of the road and strikes all men with equal force.

       This data on thinking is the whole subject of these topic papers on
       thought systems of various types.  But of primary importance is to
       be able to think about the information and processes of thinking
       itself.
