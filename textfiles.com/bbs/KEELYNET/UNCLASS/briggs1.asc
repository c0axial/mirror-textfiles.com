       Several of our  friends  have  been  discussing the recent events in
       Russia, wondering WHY IN HELL there  is  not more of a public outcry
       made about how Yeltsin has "taken over."  Come on,  you  don't  just
       DISSOLVE sections of  the  government JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T COMPLY
       TO YOUR WISHES.  So our government  just nods their collective heads
       and sends letters of congratulations.  And leave it up to Joe Bob to
       have to bring  it  to  the  public  sensibility with  his  excellent
       repartee'.  So here tis'.

                From the Dallas Observer October 21 - 28th edition
                               Film - Joe Bob Briggs

       I've got a question.

       Why would 19  Parliamentary democracies "praise" a man WHO ABOLISHES
       a parliament?

       Maybe there's something I don't understand about Yeltsin.  Maybe I'm
       naive.  Maybe I'm a man who sleeps  in his underwear.  But something
       is seriously WRONG here when all the FREE governments  of the world,
       including our own Newnited States, give three cheers for a guy who's
       over there OUTLAWING political parties, closing down newspapers, and
       generally acting like...well...kinda like a Commie DICTATOR.

       Okay, look, they  had  this  Parliament  that had a lot of loudmouth
       guys trying to stop all the reforms,  right?   And a lot of 'em were
       Commies.  And a lot of 'em were these weirdbeard ultra-right loonies
       who wanna bring  back  the czar.  And they didn't  give  two  diddly
       squats for the  welfare  of  the  country - they just wanted to stop
       Yeltsin.

       To which I  say, SO WHAT?  Isn't  this  the  same  dang  thing  that
       happens in the Eyetalian Parliament every day of the  week?   Aren't
       these Communists acting  exactly  like  the Communists in the FRENCH
       Parliament?  Don't all  the looney  political  parties  ALWAYS  band
       together and gang up on the majority party?


                                      Page 1

       But THEY WERE  ELECTED, RIGHT?  They got their jobs FAIR AND SQUARE,
       RIGHT?  There were a bunch of Russian citizens who went to the polls
       and marked "Commie"  on  the  ballot.   So  it's  not  like  they're
       Stalin's Communists, who never faced a fair election in their lives.
       They're just like  those  racists  they always elect  in  Louisiana.
       Everybody shrugs their  shoulders  and says, "How'd they get elected
       again?  I didn't vote for 'em.  Did  you vote for 'em?"  But they're
       ELECTED, and so they GET TO STAY in the legislature.  You don't have
       to like 'em.  You just have to agree THAT THEY WERE ELECTED.

       And so what are you SUPPOSED to do if you don't like  the way things
       are going in Parliament?

       YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO RESIGN!

       This triggers new elections.

       You're not supposed to MAKE EVERYBODY ELSE RESIGN!

       No wonder the  guys  were  holed  up in the Parliament building with
       Kalashnikov AK-47's.

                    You know what their number one demand was?

                               ACCESS TO THE MEDIA.

             They didn't wanna KILL Yeltsin.  They wanted to BE HEARD.

       But, as it  turned out, they get  their  newspaper  OUTLAWED.   They
       ended up in prison.  And the Commie Party was ABOLISHED.

       Now, in order to make the circle complete, they should  all  ask for
       political ASYLUM in  France  or  Italy, where the Communist Party is
       STILL LEGAL.

       And as to the Czar-loving right-wingers,  they  probly  feel this is
       just "business as usual."  Communists, Yelsinites,  what  DIFFERENCE
       does it make?

       They all EVENTUALLY THROW YOU IN JAIL.

       All this is very Russian and very understandable.

       What I don't  understand  is WHY do WE APPROVE OF IT?  I don't think
       WE'D REACT the same way if Clinton  CANCELED the Congress.  Or maybe
       we WOULD.  Maybe we've ALL BECOME Commies.  What  are  we  SAYING in
       Russia - that we WANT democracy, but NOT TOO MUCH OF IT JUST YET?

       Obviously it's TOO MUCH for me to figure out.
