              This file was laboriously transcribed at KeelyNet from
                             the Perot video entitled,
                      "How to Build a Business & Create Jobs"

         Perot is  such  an inspiration to all thinking Americans that this
              info should  be  in print for  easier  reference,  study  and
                              contemplation.  Enjoy!

       All those who study the alternative sciences are  ACUTELY  aware  of
       what research efforts  in  these  areas  WOULD  LEAD  TO if properly
       funded.

       Since our studies in blocking gravity  or building over-unity energy
       generators require somewhat  extensive electronics/mechanical  labs,
       we are trying  to  get a research facility together.  We at KeelyNet
       believe we have the keys/contacts  to  unlock  one  or both of these
       areas in addition to other interesting product possibilities.

       An 85,000 square foot building has been located and  we  are seeking
       funding for $10  million  to  span a five year period as support and
       backing for several researchers to be involved in several projects.

       The primary thrust of the VANGARD  SCIENCES  RESEARCH  CENTER  is to
       function as an  Inventors'  Co-Op  to  create  new technologies  and
       devices that will be marketed or contracted for manufacturing.  This
       center will also  provide  for  conferences, educational programs, a
       major computer network, study center  and  other  profit  centers to
       help sustain and grow this center as a revolutionary new business.

       Ross Perot is an outstanding leader and inspiration  for everyone to
       try their hand  at business.  He started out on $1000 with a radical
       new idea.  We are looking into several  approaches  to achieving our
       own goal of establishing this research center.

                    Tips from Ross Perot's Business Experience
                               in Perot's own words

       Small business right now is being starved for two things, CREDIT and
       CAPITAL.

       Industries of the  future,  Biotech,  Microelectronics,   Commercial
       Aircraft, Robotics, Software, Computers, so on and so forth.

       How does a person prepare for starting his own business?

       My advice to the person who is considering starting a small business
       is :

              Serve an apprenticeship in an industry you are really excited
              about.  Let's  assume  you  have a Masters Degree in Business
              from Harvard, go to work 2nd  and  3rd  shift  on the factory
              floor, learn it from the bottom up, (get to) really know that
              business, work there a few years, INSIST on  doing  EVERY job
              and one  of  these days, a light is going on in your head and
              you're going to have a REALLY unorthodox idea, an UNMET NEED.

              The way you find it, is by  burying  yourself  in an industry
              YOU ADORE.  That's the way you identify the  unmet  need  and
              THEN you have the GERM OF THE IDEA to START YOUR OWN COMPANY!
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       What are the most important characteristics of a business founder?

       Here is a profile, they're not the brightest people you ever met and
       certainly I put  myself in that category.  They KNOW their strengths
       and weaknesses.  They surround themselves  with people MORE talented
       than they are BECAUSE they know THEIR strengths and  weaknesses, and
       each person in the organization PLAYS to his or her STRENGTHS.

       There is a  second  characteristic,  these  people  DON'T UNDERSTAND
       FAILURE, they don't KNOW when they've  lost.   If  you  wrote a book
       about any of them, again and again and again, they  were  beaten but
       just never recognized it and went on to build a great company.

       So, they have  a  level of perseverance and stick-to-it've ness that
       is really unique.  Now, they are people that others will respect and
       trust.  They are very simple people as a group.

       They do what they say they will do,  therefore  they  EARN the trust
       and respect of people around them.  And the ones who build the great
       companies, live with their customers.

       Sam Walton, standing on the floor of Wal-Mart, the  richest  man  in
       America, day after   day   after   day.   He  didn't  have  to  hire
       consultants to tell  him  what  his  customers  thought,  they  were
       talking to Sam.  There is a lesson here, the President of the United
       States needs to be out there listening to the people  also  and  not
       taking polls.  All these big corporations have financial reports and
       consultant studies.  Sam  was  out  there,  he  had their finger tip
       feel, nothing will ever replace it.  Those are the characteristics.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       What if nobody likes that new business idea though?

       Well there is good news and bad news folks, for example, my idea was
       considered so bad, that I was stuck  with  the whole thing, now that
       was painful in  the early years, but that was pretty  nice  when  it
       worked.  You can  make  it  work, I had no financial support, nobody
       would buy my stock, nobody would loan  me  any money, and here's the
       good news, if you have to bootstrap it, it is cold  rolled stainless
       steel when you finish it because you have developed a pump.

       You make a  little  money and you invest it back in the company, you
       make a little more and you invest it back in the company and pretty

                                      Page 2





       soon it looks  like  an  oil  well  in  the Middle East just pumping
       money.

       Whereas, if you  go the other way,  see,  you  had  too  much  money
       around.  Now that my businesses are very successful,  we  keep money
       as a very  scarce commodity.  Now if people don't listen to anything
       else I say tonite, please listen  to  this,  brains,  wits, creative
       talents of a  small  high  talent  team  will beat  massive  capital
       spending 10 times out of 10.

       So I use  money  like  you  use water going across Death Valley, you
       conserve it and you use the brains and wits of your people.  I could
       tell you a thousand stories.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Then that is your philosophy about spending money in a new company?

       In a new company or a big company,  see,  use the talent, brains and
       wits of your people and don't just throw money at every problem that
       comes by.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       What is the most important trait that the founder  must  possess  in
       the early days?

       Well, he has  to  have  several,  but  one  is,  he  just  has to do
       this...see the Wright Brothers HAD  to  fly.  Two bicycle repairmen,
       they had no business trying but they had to fly.  Thomas  Edison HAD
       to invent the  electric  light.   I  think he tried every way in the
       world and finally got down to his last option when he GOT IT, but he
       HAD to do it.

       That's a common characteristic, then  beyond  that  is  this point I
       made earlier, know your strengths and weaknesses, surround  yourself
       with talented people.  In summary, this very critical factor here is
       recognizing that you  can only do so much and getting the MULTIPLIER
       of the talented team.  Then you can grow, otherwise you're a one man
       genius operation.

       Only a handful of people in our great  country  can create jobs, but
       thousands of honest,  decent  people,  many brighter  than  you  who
       created the company  are  willing to work at those jobs but they are
       totally dependent on you to keep an  environment that protects their
       jobs and creates thousands of new jobs each year.

       Now the quality  that got you going, the fact that  you  persevered,
       the fact that  you  didn't  quit, the fact that you didn't recognize
       failure, the fact that you didn't  know  you  had failed is the most
       important quality you  can have when you have a worldwide  operation
       and tens of thousands of people all over the world.

       Just always focus on what you have to do AND DO IT!
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       What is the  single  most  important objective that the creator of a
       new business must have?

       If you don't listen to anything else  I  say  tonite, it's got to be
       the best in the world. The best in the world, you  say,  now  wait a
       minute, how about the best in Idaho.  Sorry, best in Texas, NO, best
       in the US,  NO.  We live in a tiny little world, we're stuck with it
       and your theme song ought to be nobody does it better, nobody does

                                      Page 3





       it half as  well  as you and your team.  Then you'll have people all
       over the world coming around with  bright  notebooks  trying to copy
       you.  Now that's where I'd like to see all of you.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       What are some important other objectives?

       Service to your customer.  The Customer is KING,  if  you  just make
       the customer king, everything will work out, see, if the customer is
       king, then you've  got  to  have  the  best  people to make the best
       products to serve your customer.   In  order to attract and keep the
       best people you've got to have an environment where  their goals and
       dreams materialize too.  So, it all just sort of fits together.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Is it important  to  write  down  what  your  company is going to be
       before you start it?

       It's the most important thing you'll  do.  I did it on a yellow pad,
       before I started my first company.  All my hopes  and  all  my goals
       and philosophies were there, I wouldn't consider starting a business
       without doing it,  very  simply and very straight-forwardly and have
       everybody in your company know what  their  philosophies are, that's
       the easy part.  Then you as the founder have to live them day in and
       day out.

       People don't care  what  you preach, their interested  in  what  you
       practice.  The worst  thing you can do is have these lofty goals and
       objectives and then not practice them.  Live them, have everybody in
       your company committed to them.

       On the interview of new employees,  discuss  them with them and they
       should be so specific that people are really excited  about  them or
       do not want  to  be  a  part of your company, but at least they know
       what they are getting into and they  know you live it.  As you build
       your company, a lot of your satisfaction will come,  if you run your
       business in the  center  of  the  field  of ethical behavior and not
       along the sidelines.

       Unfortunately, in the 80's in business, a lot of companies got cute,
       the question was, is it legal or illegal,  never  ask yourself that.
       You're only question is, is it right or wrong?  Live  in  the center
       of the field.   Your customers will appreciate that, the people that
       work with you will appreciate that  and  once you go public, believe
       me, your stockholders will appreciate that.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       How does the founder of a new company decide who to hire?

       It's the most important decision you'll make.  You  want  very, very
       talented people.  Over  the  years  I used to talk to our recruiters
       and I said look, I don't care who  you  are,  I don't care where you
       come from, I don't care where you went to school,  I  don't  care if
       you went to  school,  I  don't  care what race you are, I don't care
       what color you are, I don't care what religion you are.

       Finally one of the recruiters, since  we are in a high tech business
       would say well Ross do you care about anything?  I  said  you bet, I
       care about what you can do and I care about what you've done lately.
       Then we'd have  a  little talk on that because lately is everything,
       you run into a lot of talented people  who  want  to  kick  the ball
       through the goal once and then walk around and display their

                                      Page 4





       clippings.  Once you   kick   the  ball  through  the  goal,  that's
       yesterday's news.  What are you going to do tomorrow?

       That's the way business (works), the  faster you run, the faster you
       have to run.   Particularly  true  in a global economy.   The  other
       thing is, look  for  people who have a history of success.  You say,
       don't you want a cookie cutter, MBA,  3.6  grade  average, etc.  No,
       none of that means anything.

       Look for people who have a history of success since childhood.  Look
       for people who have a pattern of being the best. Look for people who
       love to win  because you're going to be in brutal competition.   You
       don't have to  watch  sports in this country anymore to satisfy your
       competitive instincts, because all  of us are playing in a worldwide
       superbowl all day every day for our jobs.

       So look for  people  who love to compete and love  to  win.   And  I
       stressed this so hard one day, one of the fellows said, well what if
       we run out  of  people who love to win, I said, well just get people
       who can't stand to lose.  Because  if  you have people who have that
       motivation, on their   own   they  have  all  this  initiative   and
       creativity and you've got to set your people free.

       A lot of  these  big companies keep people reigned in, I have a bust
       of John Paul Jones right outside my  office, he became a great Naval
       hero because one enlisted man, acting on his own initiative  and not
       under John Paul  Jones orders saved the day and made John Paul Jones
       a hero.  Everybody who works with me, when they walk past that, they
       smile because they know that means, if there is something that needs
       to be done, figure out what to do  and use your head, don't wait for
       me to tell you what to do, and in 9 cases out of 9,  they'll come up
       with a better idea than I had anyhow.

       Now that's the  way you get THE MULTIPLIER.  A few other thumbrules,
       if you have a corporate politician,  fire  him, if you find somebody
       who is stealing, cheating or taking advantage of other people, in my
       companies that will get you a free trip halfway around the world.

       Only I fire those people, now that gets the word out  that you don't
       do that, that  you  work  together  in  good  faith and your ethical
       standards are very high.

       These are little things, but these  are  the difference between good
       and great.  Create a professional work environment  where people are
       having fun while  they  build  the  finest  products.   That  is  so
       important and most people don't ever  talk  about it, but as long as
       you're going to work hard, as long as you're going  to  be the best,
       it's pretty important  to  look forward to it every morning and walk
       out the door every night grinning.

       Now we have  another  ground rule  in  my  companies  that  I  would
       encourage you to adopt.  Never go home at night mad, if you're upset
       about something, go into whoever you need to talk  to,  get  it  off
       your chest, get it worked out, come back in in the morning grinning.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       How important is the customer to all of this?

       It's all important,  ALL  IMPORTANT, unfortunately in our country we
       tend to forget the customer in many cases and as soon as you do, you

                                      Page 5





       lose touch with the customer, your business will deteriorate.  It'll
       take awhile, but  anytime  you think about that, go back to my story
       about Mr. Walton, make sure that as you build your company, that you
       know what your customers are thinking.   That you are really, really
       close to your customer.

       I'll sum it  up,  LIsten  to  your  customer very carefully,  get  a
       Miracle Ear if  you  need  it,  then  listen, listen, listen to your
       front line people who work with the  customer and you will know what
       to do, you  won't  have  to  guess  and  you  won't   have  to  hire
       consultants, you will know what to do.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Should the company   have  clearly  stated  philosophies  about  the
       selection and treatment of the people in the company?

       Absolutely, and my advice is very simple here, all you have to do in
       figuring out how to treat your people  is  say how do you want to be
       treated?  That's fascinating.  You just wonder if some  of these big
       companies ever thought of that.

       Just treat people  the way you would like to be treated, is it wiser
       for you to have me work for you or with you?  The answer is obvious.
       Is it wiser for you to treat me like  dirt?   Or  to  treat me as an
       equal, and with dignity and respect.  The answer is obvious.

       Now, there is something in all of us, I'm third shift,  high  school
       dropout, working on  the  loading dock, minimum wage and you're CEO.
       Right in here, there is something  inside  me  that says I'm unique,
       I'm special.  There's only one person in the world  like  me, I am a
       human being, I've got a name, I don't want to be any of these three.
       Just call me Ross, do you follow me?

       Now, if you  will treat me with dignity and respect, and treat me as
       a human being, and here's one unsolicited  piece  of  advice, to all
       you fellows running companies, make sure that the folks  that I just
       described, your entry level people, have the same benefits you have,
       they need them and that sends a message to the troops.  A parable is
       the old military  message, First feed the troops in combat, then you
       feed the officers.

       Entry people need that health care, if you didn't have it, you could
       pay for it out of your pocket.  Very  basic stuff, but you can build
       an esprit and  a team spirit that just makes it unfair  for  you  to
       climb in the ring with your competitors, if you treat your people as
       equals, and you  all team up together and take on the world and beat
       them 10 times out of 10.  That's what the game is all about.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       How do you handle the problems of  fair  treatment  of  women in the
       workplace?

       Well, women are so talented in my business, that  the  men  are at a
       disadvantage.  But, I  came  up with a very simple rule in the early
       days.  I want to have an environment  for  the women in this company
       where every man  in  this  company would be delighted  to  have  his
       daughter work here.  Now that cleans out everything in one phrase, I
       mean that goes  for  how you treat them, that goes to fair treatment
       in terms of recognition, promotions  and so on and so forth, because
       DADS are very protective of their daughters.  I want this to be a


                                      Page 6





       place where you  would  be delighted to have your daughter work.  In
       every single aspect and the rest took care of itself.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       What about employee benefits?

       Tiered benefits send a message.   If  I  am  entry  level and I have
       rotten benefits and  you're a senior executive and  you  have  great
       benefits, well I  am  obviously  very different from you.  Now I can
       understand that my salary would be different, but to realize that my
       child could get the same medical  attention  that  your's  could get
       from the benefits the company provides, sends a message.

       A lot of these big companies have multi-tiered retirement  funds, no
       way.  You check  them,  you'll  find  the  executive  fund  is fully
       funded, you work your way on down,  some  of  those  are  not  fully
       funded.  There should be one fund and then I'll guarantee  you their
       fully funded.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       What about incurring debt to build that new company?

       My advice for  people starting new companies is try to avoid debt at
       all costs.  If you have to, if it's  capital  intensive,  you do it.
       I'd recommend that you sell shares in the company first, we're going
       to create enormous incentive for people to invest in small companies
       so that it's easy to get cash in that doesn't have  to be paid back,
       you don't have that interest clock eating you alive.

       See, every small   businessman   understands  my  concern  with  the
       national debt.  Cause his tiny little  debt,  that interest clock is
       chewing him everyday, when he looks at 4 trillion dollars, he passes
       out.  But avoid it, it's like the measles, avoid it  if  you can, if
       you have to  have  a little debt, fine, but remember, everything you
       borrow, you gotta pay back.  Brains  and wits, brains and wits, keep
       the borrowed money down.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       How do you  gear  up  that new company so it will compete  with  the
       established companies?

       It's the easiest  thing in the world.  They will send in huge armies
       and these armies are bureaucratic.   Send in tiny high talent teams,
       you'll beat them 10 times out of 10 and they will dismiss  you  as a
       loony for showing  up  and they will go into cardiac arrest when you
       win.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       How important is the founder once that new company begins to grow?

       Well that's the interesting part,  in  my case at least, I just sort
       of sit there  and  enjoy  the  action  because you  have  all  these
       talented people.  There  is  something  I haven't said, you bring in
       all these talented people, you treat them with dignity, everything's
       going well but keep in mind and  this  is  so  important  for  every
       company builder, all of those people had dreams too.

       As the company  grows,  your dreams are being fulfilled,  are  these
       people stockholders?  Do  they  have  a fair piece of the ownership?
       Are you recognizing and rewarding  their  extraordinary contribution
       by making them part owners of the company?  Now let's  assume you're
       doing that.  If  you  do  everything  all  on compensation including
       salaries, bonus, stock options but you don't give people what I call

                                      Page 7





       their psychic rewards,  you're  denying them a huge part of it.  For
       example, when they do something great,  recognize  it  that day, not
       six months later, that day.

       Recognize it while their still sweating from the effort.   The final
       point here though,  is  you  need to get out of the way and let them
       move up and run the company.  The  ultimate  reward  for one of your
       hot tigers is to give him your job.  Well, you can  be  Chairman  of
       the Board, you  can just be on the board.  If you're the founder and
       a big stockholder, you don't need a title.

       Keep titles in the background.  Keep  performance in the foreground.
       Don't have people making their career trying to be a Vice-President.
       Have them make their career trying to win every single  competition.
       They'll probably wind  up  being  President  or King or whatever you
       want to make them.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       If you could give company presidents  just one piece of advice based
       on your experience, what would that be?

       It would be primarily to stay close to your customer.   If  I  could
       have two, I'd  say  stay  close  to  your  front line troops and the
       customer and say three, once you bring  all those talented people in
       keep a magic environment where they want to stay and  others want to
       come in, then you can grow.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       How do you tap the full potential of each person on your team?

       Well, each person  is  different,  you need to understand, these are
       not like nuts  and  bolts, these  are  human  beings,  each  one  is
       different, you play to their strengths in order to  tap  their  full
       potential, and you  keep  an  environment  where  they  are  free to
       exercise their initiative and creativity.

       The worst thing you can do to talented people is to freeze them in a
       procedure-oriented environment where  they  are  not  able  to think
       creatively and come up with unorthodox ideas that believe  it or not
       are probably ten  times  better than mine, and very important, very,
       very important, leave a lot of room for the 22-23 year olds that are
       too young, too inexperienced to ever have a great idea, to come into
       your office, kick the door open and  say, well why don't we paint it
       purple?

       A radical, unorthodox  new  idea, most of my net worth  today  rests
       squarely on the  really  weird  ideas  of  people  too young and too
       inexperienced to have a great idea  and  all we did is listen, and 9
       times out of 10, we'd take that young tiger and say  OK,  tough guy,
       if you're so in love with it, here's a small team, here's everything
       you need, just  go  do  it  and he'll walk out grinning and 3 months
       later, he or she will have done something  that  most  big companies
       would take 5 years to do and spend hundreds of millions  of  dollars
       on research and  they  would  come back with it.  Now that's the way
       you get things done.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Ross, as you build a new company,  what  is  the  importance  of the
       family?

       I think the  most  important  thing  I  can say to  people  building
       businesses in this country today, how I started with nothing, wound

                                      Page 8





       up on the  other  side  of  the economic spectrum and I can tell you
       that money is the most over-rated  thing  in the world.  If you make
       money your god  in  building  your company, you probably  won't  get
       there.

       If you make  being  the  best your goal, you probably will get there
       and financial success will come as  a  by-product.  But on all those
       special days when your children need you at the Little  League  ball
       field or at  the  Campfire  Girl  meetings  or  at  the  Girl Scouts
       meetings or at  the PTA meetings and  all  those  once-in-a-lifetime
       little opportunities when your children need you, if  you're  on the
       road and you're  not there and you neglect them, you're going to pay
       a terrible price when their grown.

       So, keep your priorities straight.   Keep  an environment where your
       people can keep  their  priorities  straight,  and  give  a  lot  of
       attention to your  family.   Now I've had the interesting experience
       of knowing the wealthiest people in the worldand I can tell you that
       if you have all the marbles and  your  family  is  a  mess  and your
       children are a mess, you can be miserable and unhappy,  even  though
       you're surrounded by things.

       So, keep your priorities straight and from my own perspective, I can
       tell you that I never felt wealthy until my children were grown, til
       they were good  citizens  with a deep concern for other people and a
       willingness to do  something  about   it.    Keep   that   kind   of
       environment, there is  a very special time in your  life  when  your
       children are growing  up,  don't  neglect  your family to build your
       company, if you do, you may wind up wealthy, but miserable.

       Here is one  that  you've  got to  listen  to.   Success  makes  you
       vulnerable, adversity builds strength.  But success breeds arrogance
       and complacency.  How  do  you avoid that?  Every heavyweight  boxer
       pays the price,  gets there, becomes the champion of the world, then
       starts his arrogant phase and some young person nobody ever heard of
       knocks him off in the next fight.

       Relish competition.  The more brutal,  the  better.  The bigger, the
       better.  The greater the odds against you, the better.   That  keeps
       your organization lean  and hard, always look for the tough ones and
       go out to win every single point.

       Summarizing, how important building new businesses, how important is
       that to the future of this country?

       It's everything, for example, if  we  had  stayed  where  we were 50
       years ago, we'd still probably be building buggies  and making buggy
       whips and bridles and saddles.  You have to keep moving forward.

       Our great country  and God bless the people in Washington, their not
       villains, see, I  don't understand  brain  surgery  and  they  don't
       understand business, and business is our problem  and  they  talk to
       economists.  One of the candidates the other night on the debate was
       bragging about how  many economists he had on his staff.  I just sat
       their cringing, that's like having  Faith  Healers  and Rain Makers.
       These guys got us in this mess we're in.

       Economists base everything on theory, what we need  is  people  with
       practical experience about business that KNOW how to do this.  We

       practice 19th century capitalism because that was what used to work.
       Japan and Germany  didn't get capitalism until 1945, so they created
       1950 capitalism.  We've got 1850  capitalism,  their  moving towards
       21st century capitalism and we have one of the two political parties
       saying, Let's just  keep things the way they are,  while  the  other
       party says, Let's  have  a  little  change, but they don't know what
       they're talking about.

       The people that asked me to go on  the ballot are saying, Let's just
       fix it and get ready for the 21st century, pass the  American  dream
       onto our children.  That's what we're talking about.  Maybe the best
       summary I could  give you of the perserverance I'm talking about, is
       one of Churchill's famous speeches,  it's  his  shortest  speech and
       this is the  entire speech, "Never give in, never  give  in,  Never,
       Never, Never!"

       Thank you very much.
