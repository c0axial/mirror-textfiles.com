This is the modified version of this file and includes additional information
as well as the LOTSIGN.BAS program.  LOTSIGN helps you generate simple numbers
from complex signatures based on Numerology.  Also included is an excerpt from
NEUTRAL1.ASC to help you understand the nature of the Tetractys.

December 10, 1994

This is a report of a partial success with a lottery system where the numbers
are derived using numerology.  It's the first time I've ever hit 4 out of 6
and in this case was for an estimated 45 million dollars.  I don't know if
that's worth anything more than about a buck or two, but will see tomorrow.
At any rate, perhaps you can try this technique with your special addresses or
whatever and see if you have any 'luck' with it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My Lottery numbers were based on fixed addresses using numerology;

 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9      JERRY W DECKER  JERRY DECKER
 A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I      15997 5 453259  15997 453259
 J  K  L  M  N  O  P  Q  R        31  5   28      31    28
 S  T  U  V  W  X  Y  Z              9   1           59
                                      10             14

In numerology, you add each number to the others.  Because the lottery does
not exceed 50, anything over that, I simply added the numbers together.

I used all possible combinations for two PO Boxes as well as my home address.
That includes the name, address, city, state and zip.  For instance;
             KeelyNet
             PO Box 1031
             Mesquite, Texas 75149

which comes to 3 possible numbers 7 - 34 - 43.

Other numbers used in my case are;

PO BOX 1031        VANGARD SCIENCES   -   9  36  45
(old address)      KEELYNET           -   7  34  43
                   KEELYNET BBS       -   1  10  39  48

PO BOX 870716      VANGUARD SCIENCES  -   4  13  40  49
(new address)      KEELYNET           -   8  35  44
                   KEELYNET BBS       -   4  13  40  49

HOME ADDRESS                          -  20  24

MY LUCKY NUMBERS      1    4    7    8    9   10   13   20   24   34
                     35   36   39   40   43   44   45   48   49

                                     Lottery numbers drawn for 12/10/94
                                           12  13  34  44  46  49

40  43  44  45  48  49

Strangely enough, I had used phone numbers, my address without including my
name/city/state/zip, social security, etc., all with maybe 2 matches, but
never higher.

There was a guy in Grapevine (a 'burb' of Dallas) who claimed he'd used 50
ping-pong balls, each numbered with a 1 to 50.  That guy won about 10 Million.

I bought 50 ping-pong balls at Wal*Mart (I think there were 6 or 8 to a pack
for $1.19), total cost about $11 because of a magic marker.  I numbered all
these and put them in a round laundry basket.  On several occasions now, I
have shaken and randomly drawn these balls (with eyes closed) and was lucky if
I even got 2 numbers out of the 6.

As another attempt at random selections, I bought a dart board and two 6-packs
of darts.  I then made up two patterns of circles with the 1 in the center and
the 50 on the outside ring.  The rest of the numbers were gridded and in
concentric circles.  Using random throws, duplicates were re-thrown, again I
was lucky if I even got 2 out of the drawn 6.

One of the guys at work said he heard about a fellow who had cut up 50 tiny
pieces of paper, numbered 1 through 50.  The guy randomly drew from this cup
and won several million dollars.

I also read about a Wall Street stock prediction experiment where the stock
page was hung on the wall and the experimenter concentrated on choosing a soon
to be successful stock.  When darts were randomly thrown, the group had
success rates very close to OR EXCEEDING 50%, much higher than the success
rates of 'orthodox' market analysts/consultants.

The Texas Lottery uses 3 different machines, one of which is randomly selected
before each drawing and multiple runs are made to ensure no 'anomalies' such
as consistently recurring numbers.

Well, if I can help you in figuring out your numbers, just give me a shout on
KeelyNet.  I started working on a simple program that would automatically
generate numbers based on a string the user types in, but it is still in the
works.  If you win anything, just donate 10% to Vanguard Sciences so we can
get our Research Center going...<g>....thanks and good luck!......>>> Jerry

As an update on the results of this drawing, it is now 12/11/94 and I found
out two people drew the winning 6 number combination to split an estimated 45
million dollars.

There were also   :  287,015 people who got 3 of 6 to win $    3.00
                      14,928 people who got 4 of 6 to win $  115.00
                         213 people who got 5 of 6 to win $2,244.00

The winning numbers were       12  13  34      44  46  49
My numbers were             8      13  34  39  44      49

The following is excerpted from NEUTRAL1.ASC on KeelyNet;

                        ***  HARMONY AND INTERFERENCE  ***

  A knowledge of the laws of Harmony can be intelligently used to generate
  interferences (collisions) in the Aether in a positive or negative manner.
  (known in orthodox terms as conjugation or wave mixing...)

  Positive (constructive) interferences add to and multiply while Negative
  (destructive) interferences subtract from and divide frequencies.

  This means that we have a spectrum of creation generated from the divisions
  of the Aether which can be shown by the following :

            Aether
                 Magnetism
                      Electricity
                            Light
                                 Heat
                                      Sound
                                          Physical Vibration
                                                 Matter

  Cascading forcefalls of Aether divide to generate infinite interference
  patterns which form the Universe and all Creation.
  (this principle applies to all phenomena whether chaos, random patterns,
  matter or energy)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                         ***  TRINITY AND SIGNATURES  ***

  A fundamental frequency is generated and sustained by two other frequencies
  which each in turn are generated and sustained by two other frequencies, ad
  infinitum..

                                    Fundamental
                                2                3
                              4   5            6   7

  This pattern continues throughout the physical and energy body of an
  individualized structure and is the basis of the SACRED TETRACTYS of
  the Greeks.

                                        *
                                       * *
                                      * * *
                                     * * * *

  We can now  see how tuning to the Fundamental will give a certain degree of
  "sympathy" to a mass aggregation.

  This appears to be the basis for the trinity as manifest in all creation in
  the physical forms of PUSH, PULL AND BALANCE.

  As we tune to successively finer frequencies IN ADDITION to those preceding,
  we find progressively more precise sympathetic linking to allow remote
  stimulation and control of the target aggregation.

  (As used in the lottery to reduce custom complex lottery signatures to 2
   digit numbers, it should enhance your chance of winning, only reports back
   and future successes will prove it, my case is highly singular)
