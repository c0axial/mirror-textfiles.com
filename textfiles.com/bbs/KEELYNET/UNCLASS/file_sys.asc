                          THE WORLD'S BEST FILING SYSTEM

                   by Geoffrey E. Dolbear, PhD (Copyright 1989)

       Anyone working with facts and ideas, and that includes most writers,
       learns to be  a  packrat, storing away notes and articles for future
       projects.  But being a packrat is  no  good when you can't find what
       you stashed away.   You must adopt some kind of system  for  storing
       and finding things, a filing system.  I'd like to tell you about the
       filing system I consider the world's best.

       I have been  collecting  articles for over twenty years in my career
       as an industrial scientist.  My collection now totals almost fifteen
       linear feet, filling two filing cabinets and invading a third.

       Yet this mountain of paper is so  nicely  organized  that it is rare
       that I cannot find a needed reference in less than  a  minute.   And
       now that I'm  spending  all  my  "free" time on my freelance writing
       business at home, I've developed a  filing system for those files as
       well.

       Before I describe my filing system and how you can  make one like it
       for yourself, let's  explore  what you should demand from any system
       which keeps track of your valuable information.

       What Makes a Filing System Good?

       A good filing system must meet two criteria:

            * Savability, providing a place to save everything you want
              to save, and
            * Findability, providing a fast and reliable method for
              finding things later.

       Anything less is unacceptable.  If  it's  not  obvious  where to put
       something, and its not easy to find it afterwards,  then  saving  it
       wastes effort and  space.  Both savability and findability depend on
       a cross reference system, either  in  the  user's  head  or on paper
       where it does not need to be remembered when the user is in a hurry.

       The antithesis of what we are talking about is the "haystack" file.

                                      Page 1





       This is a   stack  of  folders,  letters,  memos,  photocopies,  and
       magazines.  Every large office has at least one haystack, and I have
       seen several that were more than two feet high.

       Savability is excellent, since each  new  item is placed directly on
       the top of the pile, but findability is terrible because nothing can
       be found without sifting through everything on the pile.

       Along with savability and findability comes the requirement that the
       system keep together things which logic tells us belong together.

       It would make  no sense to file topics like "Audi" and  "Volkswagen"
       at opposite ends  of  a filing system just because their names begin
       with a and  v.   Better to put them  together  under  automobile  or
       German, depending on  whether  we're mechanics or economists.   Then
       when we build  the cross reference system we can include Audi and VW
       as alphabetical entries pointing to the correct files.

       Both savability and findability are  reduced when the system has too
       many files which contain too few items.  The optimum  is  one or two
       dozen items per  file.   When  individual files get much fatter than
       this, they should be broken into subsections,  to allow faster, more
       convenient searching.

       BUILDING A PERSONALIZED SYSTEM

       My filing system  is  better  than  just good because  it  meets  an
       additional important criterion:  it's  personalized.  I tailored its
       logical structure, sections and subsections,  around  the  kinds  of
       information I save.   This  is  much  different  than   copying  the
       structure out of a book.

       I began by  spending a couple of hours looking over my files, making
       a list of the labels I found on the folders.

       Then I put  this  list into a logical  structure  using  a  1.A.1.a.
       outline.  I like the I.A.1.a. outline because it  makes  the  system
       both flexible and expendable to deal with new subjects.  Since 1977,
       my seven original headings have grown to nine.

       Next I reorganized the file folders into this structure.  This was a
       big job and consumed several hours.

       As I removed  each  file  from its drawer I attached its new outline
       number using temporary stick-on labels.   The  files  then went back
       into the drawer in the new order.

       Over the next  six  months I used my new system daily,  changing  it
       wherever appropriate to increase its utility.  When the time came to
       formalize it, I  convinced  my  boss to allow me to hire a temporary
       clerk.  She was a genuine luxury in  a  company chronically short on
       clerical help.

       In a week  she  typed  and installed permanent labels  for  all  the
       files, and generated  an  alphabetical  cross  reference system in a
       three ring binder.

       In summary, my filing system was assembled in five steps:

            1. Prepare an inventory of existing files,
            2. Organize existing titles into trial groups, using the
               outline format,
            3. Rearrange, using temporary labels,
            4. Use the system for several months, polishing its
               structure for ease of use,
            5. Install permanent labels and prepare an alphabetical
               cross reference.

       Because I was  willing  to take my time with these steps, the filing
       system fits my needs like a glove.   For a decade it has worked hard
       for me, helping me store and find the information I need  whenever I
       need it.

       The well-thumbed cross reference file has been updated  twice and is
       about to need it again.

       It is so  important  to  everyday  use  of  the  files  that I would
       recommend preparing the cross reference when the first rearrangement
       of the files is completed.  In fact,  that is just what I did when I
       set up a filing system for my articles on fly fishing.

       WRITING FILES

       One of my freelance writing areas is fly fishing.   I have collected
       what seems like  tons  of  articles,  maps,  and newsletters.  For a
       while they all fit in a few folders,  but  the packrat in me ensured
       that the collection would outgrow its simple beginnings.

       Applying what I  learned  from  my  scientific files,  I  have  also
       created an efficient system around these files.

       I was able  to  use  the  outlining  feature of my word processor to
       construct the subject outline, a luxury not available ten years ago.

       For the cross reference index, I made  a copy of the outline, copied
       the outline numbers after each entry, and erased the  numbers on the
       left.

       Then I went  through  and added synonyms for several of the entries,
       and split all paired items so that  both  entries  appeared  in  the
       list.

       Finally I alphabetized  the  list,  polished  the   formatting,  and
       printed it off.  My net investment was two hours one evening.

       PHYSICAL STRUCTURE

       As long as  it  is neat, the physical structure of the filing system
       is less important than the logical structure.

       Notes and reprints can be stored  in  folders,  envelopes,  or  even
       paper bags, collected in drawers, boxes, baskets  and  even  garbage
       cans, I suppose.  You can spend a little or a lot.

       I prefer hanging  files.  Most filing drawers and cabinets allow you
       to install rods for hanging files, and some even have them built in.

                                      Page 3





       For my fly  fishing  files  I've  purchased  the plastic milk crates
       which are designed for hanging folders.   They  are  convenient  and
       certainly cheaper than good filing cabinets, although  right  on the
       verge of expensive.

       While neatness is  inherently  pleasing  to the eye, that's only its
       third most important virtue.  Second  is  the  ease  of using a neat
       file.  First is that the paper saved in a messy system gets messy
       and harder to use.

       Something else that keeps a filing system neat is occasional  use of
       the garbage can.   An  hour  spent culling files will produce enough
       outdated data and unneeded duplicates to generate free space that no
       filing system seems ever to have.

       SUMMARY

       Everyone who collects information  for  current  and future projects
       eventually faces the  prospect  of developing some  kind  of  filing
       system.

       The truly dedicated  packrat soon moves on to the point where even a
       simple system is inadequate.  You'll  know  you're  there  the third
       time you cannot locate a critical item you filed  only  a  few weeks
       before.  If that's happened to you, take the time to reorganize into
       your own World's Best Filing System.
