                    HIGH TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY SPECIALTY

                    OUTLINE FOR PREPARING A BUSINESS PLAN


       It is important  to remember that our outline should be treated as a
       guide, and not as a rigid, all-encompassing format:

            each business is unique and its plan should reflect as much.

       It is also important to understand  that no reasonable investor will
       look at your  plan  as  indelibly  etched  in  stone.    As   market
       conditions change, as  company strategies evolve, as projections are
       surpassed or not reached, the plan  should  be  updated  to  reflect
       revised scenarios.
       ------------------------------------------------------------------

       A FEW GENERALIZATIONS ABOUT BUSINESS PLANS

       o   The Executive Summary is critical: This two to three page
           summary of the plan is where most investors turn first; it is
           where they decide to read on or to decline the opportunity.

       o   Focus:  The plan should be clear as to products to be devel-
           oped and markets to be addressed by the business.  Do not say
           the company will develop a widget and sell it to General
           Motors and the grocery store down the street without detailing
           how it's to be done.

       o   Avoid unsubstantiated superlatives:  The "trust me" school of
           thought doesn't work in business plans -- if your product is
           going to be the best in the market, thoroughly describe why.

       o   Quantity does not equal quality:  The well written plan is
           succinct and to the point. The typical plan should be able
           to say it all in 30 to 50 pages.

       o   First impressions  are lasting impressions: Incorrect  spelling,
           grammar, punctuation;   numbers   that  don't  total;  a  poorly
           organized plan; all can add up to sink a proposal that might

                                      Page 1





           otherwise float.  Take the time to have the plan proofread by at
           least three other members of your team.

       o   "Slick" plans can be a turnoff:  Expensively prepared plans
           are often perceived as form over substance and frivolous
           spending.  Don't waste scarce financial resources on a too-
           professional document.

       o   Avoid the use of non-assertive language:  Qualifying words
           such as "might," "probably," "maybe," "perhaps," and the like
           can have a subtly negative effect on readers; be positive or
           don't say it at all.
       ------------------------------------------------------------------

       The Business Plan -- An Outline

       I. NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

            Usually the first page of the document, the non-disclosure
            agreement states that the information in the plan is
            proprietary and is not to be shared, copied, disclosed, or
            otherwise compromised.  The agreement can be verbal or can
            take the form of signed documentation.

            Be prepared to negotiate on signed non-disclosures, as many
            investors balk at such agreements.

       II. CONTROL NUMBERING

            Also usually on the first page of the plan, the control
            number is cross-referenced to a journal kept by the
            entrepreneur (i.e., copy 14 issued to Jake Johns on
            September 10, 1984).  Control numbering is not critical,
            but does help keep track of issued plans.

       III. THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

            Many consider this the most important part of the plan
            because it is what investors read first.  It is the
            "tickler" through which an investor will be convinced to
            spend more time on the plan itself.

            The Executive Summary should be as short as possible, but in
            any event, should not exceed three pages. It should be a
            concise and clear highlight of what the company is all about
            and what's in it for the investor.  It should include
            descriptions of the following, while at the same time
            remaining to the point:

              o   The Company --  When formed
                       To pursue what purpose:
                          .  design a new product
                          .  manufacturing
                          .  marketing
                          .  etc.

              o   The Product(s) --  What are you selling
                       What makes it unique
                       Is it a proprietary product/other entry barriers
                       At what stage is its development
                       Distinguishing features from competition
                          . pricing
                          . quality
                          . speed
                          . etc.

              o   The Market --  Current size
                       Domestic/international
                       Recent growth (cite sources)
                       Projected growth (cite sources)
                       Estimated company market share

              o   Financial --  Financing sought:
                          .  for what purposes
                          .  will carry company how far
                       Five-year revenue and net income projections
                       Projection of when profits will begin

              o   Management --  How complete is the team
                       Brief past experience
                       Highlight strengths
       ------------------------------------------------------------------

       V. THE COMPANY

            In this section, a more detailed description of the company
            is made, but it is essentially an expansion of the details
            in the Executive Summary.

              o    When founded and by whom?
              o    What markets to be pursued?

            Is the company creating demand or is it responding to
            existing demand?

              o    What will the products do for buyers?  Reduce
                   costs; improve efficiency; etc.

              o    Who are the buyers (not specifically, but in
                   general, i.e., disk drive manufacturers,
                   semiconductor manufacturers, etc.)


                                      Page 3





              o    How many people in the company now; how many
                   expected in the future?

              o    What technologies being used in production?

            Generally, this section will run two to five pages in length
            and will serve to highlight details covered in greater depth
            in later sections.

       VI. THE MARKET

            More often than not, this section proves to be one of the
            major obstacles to entrepreneurs in writing business plans.
            The section should provide an indepth view of how the
            company perceives the market into which it will be selling:

            Market size:
              Recent past
              Current
              Projected (5 to 10 years)

            Market trends:
              Where is the market going and why?
              What are the economic trends?
              Maturity of market -- growth stage or level?

            Products in the market:
              What is available?
              How many suppliers?

            Market players:
              Who is buying?  OEMS; end users?
              Why are they buying?
              What are they looking for?
              On what factors are buy decisions made?

            Market segments:
              Natural splits -- geographic, industries, volume
              vs. unit buyers, etc.
              Growth prospects within each segment

            Market distribution:
              How are products delivered to buyers?
              .  direct sales
              .  manufacturers' representatives
              .  distributors

            Competition:
              Who are they?
              Strengths?
              Weaknesses?
              Markets addressed (segments)
              Reputation

            The better your know your competition, the better you'll be
            able to plan around them (and the more you'll impress
            potential investors).



                                      Page 4





            How well you know the market will be demonstrated in this
            section.  The sources for intelligence in any market are
            myriad:

              o   Existing manufacturers (competitors)
                  .  product brochures

              o   Interviews with marketing people (which requires a
                  degree of brashness, but don't be timid in asking a
                  potential competitor to lunch to pick his or her brain).

              o   Trade publications: if you don't know what's available,
                  ask someone   who   does;   call   editors   for  further
                  suggestions on sources.

              o   Analysts' reports: available from many securities
                  brokers (Merrill, Lynch; Hambrecht & Quist, etc.).

              o   Users of existing products:
                  .  purchasing directors
                  .  manufacturing directors

              o   Potential customers: it is an absolute must that you have
                  as many  discussions   as  possible  with  users  before,
                  during, and after formation of the company.
                  Their feedback  should  be incorporated  into  both  your
                  products and plans.

       VII.  MARKETING STRATEGY/IMPLEMENTATION

            After the thorough description of the market, this section
            should cover, in depth, how you plan to get products to your
            buyers and what strategies you'll use to help accomplish
            that task.

              o   Target market by segment:
                  -  geographic
                  -  industry
                  -  type of buyer

            Here, you want to specifically identify the market niche you
            will address.  What is it about the segment that makes it
            right for your company?  Is it a niche ignored by competi-
            tors or ill-served by competitors?  If you go into it and
            make a profit, why won't a larger competitor enter it, also;
            (revenue volume in niche too low; buyers in market are unit
            purchasers, etc.).

              o   Credibility: company and product, why should customers
                  buy a new product from an unproven company?

              o   Pricing strategy: high, medium, or low relative to
                  market?  Why?

              o   Warranty policies: standard or non-standard

              o   Imaging:  quality, reliability, service, response time --
                  all are key components  in  imaging and should fit neatly
                  with other strategies (i.e., high quality and low price

                                      Page 5





                  may not appear to make sense -- if they do, in your case,
                  explain why).

              o   Advertising and public relations:  Again, these
                  strategies should match with others' (are ads in Modern
                  Mechanics compatible  with attempting to develop an image
                  of quality?)

              o   Distribution channels:
                  -  factory distribution
                  -  company-owned regional distribution
                  -  independent remote distribution
                  -  order lead times

         Here, the idea is to describe the  physical means by which product
         will be delivered to buyers.

              o   Servicing:
                  -  factory-only service
                  -  company field service engineers
                  -  contracted service
                  -  service contracts
                     .  profit centers
                     .  loss leaders

         When the product breaks down, how are you going to fix it
         with the smallest cost to you and the minimum disruption
         to your customer?

              o   Sales
                  -  direct sales
                  -  reps
                  -  distributors
                  -  hybrid

         How are you going to sell the product?  If you use reps,
         what kind of incentives will you use to get them to know
         and push  your  products.   Is  it  a  highly  technical   product
         requiring skilled  sales  people?   At  what  level in the buyers'
         organizations will sales be made?   Should  senior  management  in
         your company participate directly in the sales effort to establish
         company and product credibility?  How will you compensate sales --
         commissions (payable  on  order  of receipt of payment?),  bonus?,
         salary?

       VIII. PRODUCTS

             Provide a detailed description of existing products and
             plans for future products.  Are products market-ready and,
             if not, how long until they will be?

             Description (illustration, if appropriate)

              o   Bill of materials (major components, not too detailed)
              o   Potential component supply problems
              o   Proprietary protection (trademark, copyright, patent)
              o   Advantages/disadvantages to competing products
              o   Price and cost


                                      Page 6





              o   Differentiation from competition -- Here, a high level
                  matrix comparing  your products' capabilities, strengths,
                  and characteristics to your competitors' is
                  useful.  (Be sure your product is more easily visible
                  in the matrix -- bold face print at top of matrix is
                  appropriate).

             Future Products

              o   Innovations to existing line
              o   New products
              o   Development time lines

       IX.  MANUFACTURING/RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT

             Depending on the nature of your company, these two areas
             might more appropriately be separated.

              o   Financial resources to be committed to R & D
              o   Facilities requirements
                  -  leased
                  -  purchased
              o   Labor requirements:
                  -  local labor pool
                  -  skilled
                  -  unskilled
                  -  full time/part time
              o   Subcontracted production
                  -  sole or multi-sourced
                  -  quality control
                  -  supply problems
              o   Capital needs
                  -  equipment list
                  -  financial requirements
              o   Quality control
              o   Critical processes
              o   Seasonality
              o   Inventory control

       X.  MANAGEMENT

             Highlight the past experiences of the management team that
             will combine to reduce the risk typically associated with a
             startup venture. Remember the venture capital axiom that a
             mediocre product with great management is always preferred
             to the opposite: the strength of management simply can't be
             overstated in an investment decision.

              o   Resumes -- avoid excessive detail, but do hit on
                             important past accomplishments and experience;
