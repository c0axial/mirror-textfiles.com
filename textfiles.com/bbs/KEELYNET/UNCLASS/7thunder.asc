       Re: Comets and Prophets

       Dear Duncan,

       For some time now I have been going  to write to you to congratulate
       you on your magazine and to share a few thoughts with  you.   I must
       say that out  of  all  the  material  in your magazine which I, as a
       natural health practitioner, and also as a Messianic Yahudi (Jew) by
       religion, find to be extremely valuable,  the  part I find to be the
       most inspiring and  which  gives  me  the  most  enjoyment  is  your
       editorials.  Absolutely brilliant!

       However, to move  on,  there  is  one  particular subject on which I
       would like to share some insights.   I was reminded of this a couple
       of days ago when I heard that next year the northern  hemisphere  is
       expecting the largest  shower of meteorites EVER KNOWN; also, that a
       comet is going to pass close to the Earth.

       Now I'm not too sure on the truth  of  this;  I  believe it did come
       from scientific circles - you may be able to verify it.

       Anyway, what I  wanted  to  share  was  the  similarity   of   three
       prophecies, one from Nostradamus, another from Mother Shipton, and a
       third from the  Book  of  Revelation.   All  three  appear  to point
       towards the appearance of a comet  (or  something of the like) which
       is the beginning (or warning) of the end of this age  and  the times
       of trouble that  are  associated  with it.  (Like humans, the planet
       has to go through a 'healing crisis'.)

       Without further ado I will put the  three  side  by  side for you to
       see:

          Nostradamus - "The great star will burn for seven  days  and  the
                         cloud will  make the sun appear double.  The great
                         mastif will howl  all  night  long  when the great
                         Pontiff changes his abode."

       Mother Shipton -  "A  fiery  dragon will cross the  sky,  Six  times
                         before this  earth will die...  For seven days and
                         seven nights, Man will watch this awesome sight."



                                      Page 1





                        "The dragon's  tail  is  BUT  A SIGN, For mankind's
                         fall and man's decline."

       The Revelation of Yahushua HaMashiach (Chapter 10) -

           "And I saw another mighty messenger  coming  down  from  heaven,
            clothed with a cloud.  And a rainbow was on his  head, his face
            like the  sun,  and his feet like pillars of fire....and he set
            his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land, and he
            cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars.

            And when   he   cried   out  seven   thunders   uttered   their
            voices....and he swore by Him who lives forever and ever..."

       Now while the Seven Thunders are NOT recorded in Revelation  and are
       sealed, we are given a glimpse of them in the Tanakh (Old Testament)
       - Psalm 29  to  be  exact  -  I  will not reproduce it here, but the
       general picture is one of earthquakes,  fires, flood, etc.  I'm sure
       you get the general idea!

       I believe that  the  event  outlined  above  will   begin  the  most
       dangerous time in  mankind's  history, with great deceptions for the
       unwary.

       Best wishes for the future of NEXUS.  Keep up the good work.

                                                   John S.
                                                   Coffs Harbour, NSW

       P.S.  I loved the article on the history of banking in this issue.
