       Vangard note...

           Many researchers   and  inventors  feel  that  there  are  major
           negative influences who would  not  hesitate to suppress or stop
           the development and release of radical technologies  which could
           change the world as we know it.

           Conspiracy theories  and  horror  stories  abound.   We must not
           allow ourselves to become so  paranoid  that  we refuse to share
           our findings  either  commercially, through a patent  or  simply
           through others   capable   of   understanding   what   has  been
           accomplished.

           Many inventors fail to share their  work,  at least keep records
           in the hands of people you can trust.  Spectacular  technologies
           have been lost through the simple failure to pass on the results
           of years of work.  No one lives forever and one person can never
           do all they wish in a single lifetime.  When many minds target a
           problem, led  by  one mind of exceptional ability, miracles will
           result.

                    Microcomputer Inventer Shuns Fame for Work

                      By Keith Stone, Los Angeles Daily News
                       -Cincinatti Enquirer 1/6/91  p. A-13

          Working seven days a week in the  family room of his suburban Los
       Angeles house, Gilbert Hyatt emerged in 1968 with a  tangle of wires
       that he predicted would change the world.

          At a  time when high-technology companies were building expensive
       and complex computers, the lone inventor held in his hands a way to
       introduce smaller computers into everyone's life.

          Twenty-two years  later,  Hyatt's  invention  -  the  single-chip
       microprocessor - is described as the brain that drives millions of
       products, from personal  computers to video games,  televisions  and
       even cars.

          Hyatt has not pocketed a dime from billions of dollars in

                                      Page 2





       microprocessor sales - but that could soon change.

          Last July, after a 20-year battle, the U.S. Patent Office awarded
       Hyatt a patent  for  his microprocessor - a move that stunned high -
       technology companies from San Jose, Calif., to Tokyo.

          The soft-spoken Hyatt, who now  lives  in a tract house in Orange
       County, Calif., said he is not bitter that he had  to  spend  nearly
       half his 52  years  trying  to  convince  patent  examiners  that he
       deserved credit for designing the device.

          "I think that it proves that  the  system  works,"  he  said in a
       recent interview.  "I think vindication is probable a good word." *1

       Millions at Stake

          Through his  patent,  the iconoclastic inventor  stands  to  earn
       millions of dollars  from  the  same  tiny piece of circuitry that a
       technical evaluator dismissed decades ago as "ridiculous." *2

          But before Hyatt can collect money  for  his work, he must either
       persuade high-technology companies to pay him royalties or take them
       to court for infringing on his patent.

          Some experts have speculated that Hyatt's patented  design may be
       used in millions   of   electronic   products  that  are  driven  by
       microprocessors.

          "If everything went his way, we'd  be  talking  about substantial
       amounts of dollars.   We'd  be talking about millions,"  said  Susan
       Nycum, a specialist  in high-technology law and a partner at Baker &
       McKenzie of Palo Alto, Calif.

       An Austere Lifestyle

          But even if Hyatt does wind up  with millions of dollars from his
       patent, it is unlikely that he'll spend much of it on luxury.

          "I don't  have  a  lot  of  personal  needs,"   said   Hyatt,   a
       bespectacled man who  peppers  precise sentences with terms like "D-
       RAM accelerator."

          "I'm used  to an austere environment,  and  you  don't  change  a
       lifetime of habits just because your circumstances change," he said.

          Hyatt plans to keep his 1977 Toyota.  "It's still reliable and
       efficient," he said.  And he does not intend to move  from  the two-
       story tract house in La Palma, where he now lives alone.

          When Hyatt  recieved  his  patent,  he  did  not open a bottle of
       champagne.  He does not drink.  Instead,  he  said he telephoned his
       patent attorney and a few colleagues to tell them the news, and then
       "proceeded with my design work."

          Hyatt plans to spend his money on accelerating his research.

          In his small laboratory, in a secret location  amid  a  sprawl of
       wire and electronic  equipment, Hyatt spends his days tinkering with
       devices that he claims will radically change computers.

          "They are  what  I  call  the  personal  computer  for  the  21st
       century," he said.

          But the lack of money has hobbled  Hyatt's  research.   "I  could
       have been    significantly    more    productive,    technologically
       productive," Hyatt said.

          Hyatt is reluctant to divulge too much information, saying his
       experiences have taught him the value of discretion.
