               Created May 13, 1995 in response to a suggestion
              by Hal Fox in the May 1995 issue of New Energy News

  I hope those who find the KeelyNet files, messages and updates useful,
  entertaining or of interest, and that you all understand that this board was
  never intended to be a business or to make money in any way.

  Hal Fox recently published an e-mail that was never intended to be used as
  an article (and I am flattered that he did so).  Norman Wootan has been
  graciously sending Hal updates from the message base on what all was being
  discussed, announced or commented on.

  This is the first time I'd realized this was happening because of that e-
  mail message having reached print.  Hal indicates he doesn't have the time
  to peruse such facets of computerdom and so appreciated Norman sending them
  to him AS DO I (thanks, Norm).

  However, in a glowing series of very positive comments about KeelyNet and
  how everyone so freely shares information, Hal followed those words up with
  a request to send contributions to help support the effort if you felt it
  was of interest or use.  Thank you Hal Fox for recognizing that there are
  costs to keeping things together and consistently online.

  As everyone knows, KeelyNet does not charge and is supported solely from my
  personal finances and through the occasional sale of a disk set for $50.

  This has always been my 'United Way' to try to get people to a level of
  understanding regarding some of these subjects (not that I have a superior
  understanding but that I seem to have a lot of info in many areas and can
  type fast...<g>...) and to try to elicit some kind of creative spark, that
  would result first in dialogue, then research, then actual experiment.  All
  the while stressing how important it is to share what you have learned.

  I have been honored to learn from many excellent associates, comments, phone
  calls, files and communications with various individuals.  There were never
  any claims made as to my being a scientist, a writer, or even a teacher.
  That follows with everyone who I have come in contact with.  No one knows it
  all, but we all know bits and pieces.  When those pieces are correlated and
  're-presented', they aggregate to paint a clearer picture of how to do
  whatever we are attempting on each of our own paths.

  Hal suggested there might be those who would want to make some kind of
  contribution and that a file be generated explaining just how this was to be
  done.  In the past, several wonderful people have donated equipment to
  improve the board or the information generating abilities associated with
  it.  There has also been an occasional donation that has been used towards
  KeelyNet data gathering activities, and I want to thank all who have
  contributed in the past.  None of it was solicited or expected and that is
  the case now.

  So, PLEASE don't take this as any kind of guilt trip or plea.  KeelyNet will
  be online as long as I can sustain it and at this moment (it will be 6 years
  in July), only aging and death seem to be the limit (but then again, read
  some of the files on aging and see what looks like a way to stop or reverse
  it).

  If you choose to make some kind of contribution, I want to express my
  deepest appreciation for your thoughtfulness.  We all have bills and I do
  allright on mine, so if you are having the least bit of financial pinch,
  tear this up and swallow it.

  Geez, I'm really wringing my hands on this one, because to me, when you
  start talking about money and information, it smells of a scam and I want
  nothing to do with anything that smacks of that.

  But, the man stated the case and I am simply following the suggestion.

                   Make any board contributions payable to:

                                   KeelyNet
                                      or
                               Vanguard Sciences

  The mailing address is :      PO BOX 870716
                             Mesquite, TX  75187
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
One final point, to further muddy the waters, the least I can do is provide
the address and subscription for New Energy News (NEN)....it really is an
excellent publication with many hot topics, so if you want to use the KeelyNet
contribution to subscribe to it, go for it!
