The following text seeks to dispel some of the many negative claims regarding
the Indian holy man, Sai Baba.  If you get an opportunity to see some of the
video tapes made of him, take it, they are intriguing at the least.

Keep in mind that energy can be slowed to mass and vice versa.  If aether is
omnipresent in varying densities, then it could be concentrated and slowed by
sustained mental force to aggregate into a mentally produced physical pattern.

Mind over matter is a reality and an everyday occurrence, proved by the very
fact that you can move your arms or legs from a single thought.  Why could
this mental force not be extensible to control energy or external mass?  Just
keep this in mind when you are exposed to some of the phenomena claimed to be
produced by Sai Baba.............................>>>  Jerry/Sysop/KeelyNet

Intuition is fun. I happened to scan this newsgroup tonight, and am delighted
to find this subject heading. (I rarely come across the name Sai Baba on the
Net.)  I offer thanks to Linda Nelson, Atanu Dey, and Gerald Huber for
establishing this thread about him.  They have made straight the way, allowing
me a rare opportunity to talk about him on this newsgroup.  Thanks to Linda
who asked for data about Sai Baba; to Atanu who suggested me as a contact
[thanks, Atanu!]; and to Gerald who reposted two reprints about the Baba.

Linda implied it was somewhat difficult to obtain data about Sathya Sai Baba.
If she likes, I can help out with places to find data on him, starting with
Lexis/Nexis (1 800 543 6862), and the public library of most major cities.

Finding the data is not a problem: the hard part is finding UNbiased info
about him. That may be because the Swami requests his friends not to publicise
him, nor evangelize in any wise, nor even praise him in public, and never to
defend him.  He suggests folks who appreciate him do well to simply not
discuss him with the curious or with doubters - and as a result most of what
one hears about him is from those who are curious or critical of him.

Wherever I hear him discussed, I strive to discern who has facts and who posts
fancy.  Thus from long observation, I've noticed that hyperbole runs loud in
both camps, pro and con, and if I join a conversation, I try to discern, point
out, and offer what is fact distinct from fancy.  (There are some
conversations ya know that consist of no fact, no sincere inquiry, and those I
usually do not attend.) Linda seems quite sincere in her quest, and two
gentlemen have joined her, so I speak up now.  I hope all agree that
discerning fact from fancy is best when illuminating, but not fiery.  I trust
that all readers are eager to learn and share what's real without toasting
anyone for it.

Getting real, I've found that most folks who exaggerate about the Baba,
praising or panning, are those who haven't met him. I also find that more
often than not, the loudest critics, as a rule, have never talked privately
with him.

For example, Atanu Dey suggested at soc.culture.indian that a bullet in the
head was the best thing for the Baba; in discussion with him I discovered Dey
had never met the man, but apparently Atanu thought shooting him an apt hello.
Later at alt.buddha.short.fat.guy,  Dey advised his trigger finger itched
because he had heard the Baba was a faggot.  Soon after our conversation ended
as Dey withdrew from both newsgroups.

Atanu is not alone in his disgust with the Baba he has not met.  Among
published critics there are precious few who have ever even seen Sathya Sai
Baba, fewer still who have met with him privately, or even at close quarters,
and among those few, Tal Brooke, a born-again Christian author, is best known.

Before he was saved, praise God, Tal lived in India in the Swami's isolated
ashram, and speaks of his direct experience with the Baba at length in three
novel exposes' (as well as on Christian tv shows like TBN and the 700 Club).
His is by far the most exact critique about the Swami, and his statements
deserve the attention of any who long for a first-hand report that is scathing
in its denunciations, allegations, and observations.

Tal reveals that not only is the Baba a sinister homosexual child molester,
but also Satan incarnate.  Tal says so again and again, and is convinced of
that because, says Tal, the fellow does do miracles, raises the dead and so
on, but only as Beelzebub, only as the Dark One, The Anti-Christ.

Tal says he himself was once the chief and best disciple of the Baba, the man
chosen to be the new Saint Paul who would preach Sai-inanity to the west.  Tal
does not say he left the Baba, very angry, when he was not so chosen, but five
of the people with him at the time do say so.

In his book Tal says he left only because Jesus came and saved him. Apparently
Tal had not been listening when the Swami repeatedly said (and still says) he
wants no Pauls, no evangelists, no preachers, none, zip.  But at least Tal
speaks of his own experience, as he recalls it.  Almost every other critic in
print bases his or her views instead on nothing but hearsay and rumour. Few
detail any direct experience of their own, no documented facts, nor dates, nor
witnesses, nor proof.

That is why I say hyperbole seems to show up in both sides of the discussion
regarding the Baba.  For example, in her post, Linda suggested that Sai
"claims 50 million devotees worldwide." That sounds to me like hyperbole.
Where did Linda hear that? It's no small number of persons, and I wonder where
those 50 millions hang out.  I urge Linda to reveal the source of exactly
where the Baba made that `claim'.

(Did she hear him say that via a cassette, or a film, or a novel, or a
newspaper, a tv show, or in person- how?)    Where did she hear him say
it?

I ask for specifics because I find rumour and innuendo tend to vanish when due
specificity is applied. (I am not saying Linda is exaggerating; I am asking
for specifics, only. If she is right I will add the data accordingly; if she
is in error, all can learn from that as well.)

Linda advises that as far as she can find out, the Swami does little more than
perform elementary prestidigitation, producing candy and trinkets out of thin
air while the gullible watch in admiration. Gerald concurs, saying `exactly.'

How do they know? Again I ask Linda (and Gerald) to be exact in detailing
their data.  How do they know what he does, and how do they know the folks who
see him are so naive as to believe he is really doing miracles?  There are
certainly tricksters about, (David Copperfield is quite entertaining,) and
there are gullible folks as well, but I ask for specifics from Linda and
Gerald so I can determine clearly if I am in some wise now being tricked or
taken for gullible myself.

Both Linda, and Gerald, are asked to please offer some facts. The more
specificity, the better.

To that end is perhaps why Gerald posted two chestnuts: one somewhat over-
served article from Dale Beyerstein, (an article which is not by Dale at all;
it is a verbatim quote from a book by John Hislop, a man yet alive by the way
and still writing books) and the other the threadbare reprint of excerpted
minutes from a suit of B. Premanand, entitled `Satya Sai Baba and the Gold
Control Act' which was laughed out of court and the Indian newspapers some
many years back. (The story told by the taxmen who went to search the house of
the Baba is far more entertaining than the lawsuit.)

Another interesting read just about the same year as the lawsuit is from
BLITZ, the Indian equivalent of the National Enquirer. The editor of that rag
blasted the Baba on the front pages for months; issue after issue he ran
various challenges and exposees. He finally went to meet the man himself, to
show the Swami up as a con man. He was called in by the Baba for an interview,
and on his return, the editor wrote in detail of his experiences with the
Baba, again on the front page, and again for many issues. This time however,
the reports were not a challenge to the Baba, but to the readers. The
headlines went something like:

                               GOD IS AN INDIAN.
                         HIS NAME IS SATHYA SAI BABA.
                           GO AND SEE FOR YOURSELF!

                 BLITZ always specialized in weird headlines.

Should Linda, or any reader wish to find precise data on the Swami, be advised
there is thus far no central body keeping all published accounts, but finding
material is not all that difficult, for in the matter of Sathya Sai Baba, a 70
year old man living yet in the village of his birth, there are now more than
three hundred books, nearly two thousand major press articles, 67 films,
several governmentally funded television shows (UK, Japan, Netherlands,
Thailand), and a lot of talk.

I know cuz I've come across all those in the past 22 years, and surely there
must be much more.  Of the records I have studied first hand, there are some
dozen which are critical to a point of hostility.  Of those, only one is
written by an eyewitness who spent more than a short time with the Baba.  The
rest are, to my mind, interesting speculations, but hardly scientific studies,
rarely even sincere investigations. There are also a great many books and
articles that are mostly hagiographic hyperbole.

I have investigated the Swami closely, and watched him at first hand over many
years in varied conditions and environments.  I nose what I nose. In that
state of mind, I have no desire to prove anything to you, nor to disprove
anything.  I am just speaking my peace here, and moving on. Should you wish
further discussion regarding the person or teaching of Sri Sathya Sai Baba,
you are welcome to attend soc.culture.indian in the thread entitled

              SANDEHA NIVARINI SATHYA SAI BABA DISSOLVING DOUBTS

All best wishes

One odd thing that I would like explained to me.....several days ago, I went
to see a movie that was preceded by the new 'Gumby' movie.  As I sat through
the closing credits, the following appeared on the screen;

                                 Dedicated to
                                Sathya Sai Baba
                              Love All; Serve All

I thought it a very peculiar thing to be attached to a movie about Gumby and
now find this file on the InterNet.  Is this the Celestine Prophecy at work or
simply coincidence?  It's not everyday you hear or read something about Sai
Baba in 'normal' circles.......................................>>>  Jerry
