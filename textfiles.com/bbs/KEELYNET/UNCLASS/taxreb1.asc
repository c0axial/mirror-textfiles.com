          This EXCELLENT  file  has been shared with KeelyNet courtesy of a
           person who wishes to remain nameless.   The  details  are of his
            PERSONAL experiences  with  the phenomenon currently  known  as
         "UnTaxing" wherein  participants  follow a specific plan of action
            that essentially removes them  from  participation  in  the  US
        government and in the process claiming to make them IMMUNE from the
         TAX laws.  We have had contact with others who tell  us  that they
         don't use  drivers licenses and when picked up and taken to court,
          quote specific laws which causes  the  case to be thrown out post
          hast.  We  were not told the details of the aforementioned  legal
         quote but  a  few of these people also act as advocates for others
                        who wish to challenge the "system".

                           Tax rebellion, the early days

       My introduction or induction into the tax rebellion in 1978 was like
       a non-believer walking into a tent  revival.  When  I  walked  out 3
       hours later I was a believer. I had seen the holy grail  and  it was
       the constitution. Clearly, this was a document written by common men
       and easily understood by common men some two hundred later.

       Everything was clear, the government was taking us for a ride on the
       fast moving train  of  state  and  I decided to get off. It would be
       some ten years  and  many  thousand   of   dollars  in  back  taxes,
       penalties, and interest before I got back on the train  heading  for
       the cliff.

       The group I  became  involved  with  was  Your  Heritage  Protection
       Association. YHPA was a church founded  by  a man named Armon Condo.
       Armon was a  small business man in Garden Grove California.  He  was
       also a student  of  the Constitution and after several years of self
       study concluded that the following was self evident:

            The income tax was unconstitutional
            Nothing but gold and silver  could  be  made  as  a  tender  in
            payment of debt
            Federal Reserve  Notes  are  not dollars, they  are  a  general
            obligation of debt of the United States Treasury
            Wages are an even exchange of labor for money, there is no gain
            in the exchange.

       Using these precepts, he started his organization with the intent in
       mind to have the Income Tax Amendment to the Constitution declared

                                      Page 1





       unconstitutional. Along the  way,  thousands  of  people climbed on-
       board this new train and headed for  their own cliff. When the train
       finally came to a stop in the mid-1980s, several thousand  of  these
       people lost their homes, marriages, and most of what they owned.

       I am going  to  try  to chronicle the events as I saw them.  Looking
       back some 14 years some of the dates  and  the  sequence that events
       occurred in may not be completely correct, but for  all  intents and
       purposes, the events actually happened.

       Why a Church?

       Churches in America  have  traditionally enjoyed a certain amount of
       constitutional protection from  the  government.  The  IRS  code  in
       describing the tax exempt status of religious organizations  defines
       that such organizations  may  apply  for  exempt  status but are not
       required too. What this means is  that  if  you donate large sums of
       money to a church and want to declare the deduction  you  had better
       make the donation to a organization that has a tax exempt number.

       If you want   to  start  your  own  church  however,  there  are  no
       requirements that you apply for  official  recognition.  It  is  not
       difficult to obtain official recognition. All you have to do is file
       the appropriate forms.  For  instance,  Ms. Ohara,  the  well  known
       atheist used to  head a rather large organization in Texas that held
       tax exempt status as a religious organization.

       Armon used the church as a shield  against  the state. When I joined
       YHPA in 1978, they were reputed to have in excess of  5,000  members
       in California and  the  surrounding  states. The total number of tax
       groups at the time was suppose to  contain  some  30  to 40 thousand
       people. Many of  the groups differed in their approach  to  opposing
       the tax system.

       YHPA bought a  small  self  contained shopping plaza in Garden Grove
       and set up for business. They ran  a small printing shop that mostly
       printed their own  material for meetings and their  newspaper.  They
       also had their  church  offices  and  opened a number of other store
       fronts among which were a gold and silver coin shop and a dried food
       store. (More on this later.)

       YHPA held public  and member only  meetings.  Public  meetings  were
       usually held at small restaurants and would typically  draw  100  or
       more people. Word  of the meetings spread like wild fire in Southern
       California. The typical meeting would begin with a salute and pledge
       of allegiance to the flag. A warm  up man (usually a gentleman named
       Dan, I cannot recall his last name) would then take  the  podium and
       get everyone in  a  good  frame  of  mind.  This was usually done by
       asking everyone to take a dollar out of their pocket and hold it
       up. Everyone with a paper dollar would hold it in the air.

       He would then tell them that a real  dollar  would  not  burn and if
       they thought that they had a real dollar in their  hand,  then  test
       it. This usually  resulted  in  several,  if  not all, of the people
       present lighting dollar bills on fire.

       This was a great stunt and had everyone  laughing.  Dan  would  then
       open a small  hand  book  and read the definition  of  a  dollar  to
       everyone as described by the Constitution.

                                      Page 2





       Next, a small  rotund  man  with  a bald head and a full curly white
       beard would take the stand. His name  was  Irish  Conway.  Irish had
       charm, a gift of gab, the ability to hold an audience  and  a  style
       that would make any of the TV preachers look bad, real bad. He would
       start by reading   the   first   and   second   amendments   of  the
       Constitutions:

            "Congress shall make NO law respecting an establishment of
             religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.."

       He would then progress through a reading  of several articles of the
       Constitution then conclude  with one or more stories  of  atrocities
       committed by the  servants  of  the  people,  the  IRS (the Infernal
       Revenue Service) as  reported by  any  number  of  newspapers.  "The
       government has gotten away from us." he was fond of  saying, "and we
       have to take  our  government  back  from the bueraRATs."  The catch
       phrases at the time were bueraRATs and banksters.

       By the time Irish was finished, usually  40  minutes or so, he would
       have the majority of the people in the room ready  to  march  on the
       Federal Building in  Los  Angeles.  Twenty  to thirty percent of the
       people at any given public meeting  would  be  ready to sign up. The
       fee for joining  YHPA  was  $25 Federal Reserve Notes  (referred  to
       FRNs) a month.  For  the  fee, YHPA would give you a subscription to
       their newspaper (nominally  priced   at  $25  per  year)  and  legal
       assistance to represent you at the IRS or Franchised  Tax Board (the
       FTB) in California.

       I had attended  a meeting in the spring of 1978 and thought that the
       group was "on to something" but didn't  want to put myself or my new
       wife at risk. We had just moved into a house and all  I wanted to do
       was to work  and  save some money. I told a coworker about the group
       the following fall and he attended  a  meeting by himself and joined
       that night.

       Within a week,  half  of  the people I worked with  had  joined.   I
       attended a meeting  the following week and my wife was so taken with
       the concept after hearing it a second  time  that it was a done deal
       by the time the meeting was over.

       At the time  I  was  self  employed, working as a computer  software
       consultant, as were  most  of  my circle of friends.  When quarterly
       filing time came around none of us filed returns. Looking at the IRS
       instructions of who  must file,  it  was  obvious  that  no-one  had
       received any dollars  (remember, nothing but gold  and  silver  coin
       shall be made a tender in payment of debt), and just as obvious, our
       labor was an even exchange and thus, there was no gain or income.

       I coasted along  through  the  rest  of  1978  and  1979 with a smug
       feeling that I knew the TRUTH. The  truth  is  a very strange thing.
       Everyone and every group have their own version of  the  truth. That
       is really the only truth that I am aware of . If that were not true,
       then the Jews  and  Arabs, the Catholics and Protestants, Hindus and
       Moslems, and the  various sects  of  the  Christians  would  all  be
       getting along.

       Anyway, I believe  that  what happened to me was the  same  as  what
       happens to someone  who  under  goes  a  religious conversion. I was
       secure in my faith of the Constitution.

                                      Page 3





           "We hold  these  truths  to  be  self  evident  that all men are
            created equal  and  endowed   by  their  creator  with  certain
            unalienable rights."

       Surly, these words were as divinely inspired as any  in the bible or
       other document inspired  by  God.  I  was later to find out that the
       government really didn't give a damn  about  what  I  or anyone else
       felt about or though they knew about the constitution.

       It was during this time that I met the acquaintance of a Mr. William
       Drexler. Bill Drexler  had,  according  to  the  organization,   and
       stories printed in  the  YHPA  newspaper,  been the youngest Federal
       Magistrate ever appointed. After  reviewing  the  law for years from
       such a lofty perch, he resigned from Government service  because  he
       saw the light  of the Constitution and realized that the PEOPLE were
       being screwed.

       When I met Bill, he was the head Bishop  of the Church of Christ. He
       was at least as convincing as Irish when he spoke.  He  was  a large
       man (tall and  wide)  and  presented  an  impressive  figure.   Bill
       started speaking at  the members  only  meeting  and  presented  yet
       another program. He was prepared to setup a church  under the Church
       of Christ name for anyone for the sum of 500.00 FRNs.

       What did this do for you? Well, it bought you a number of things:

            a set  of  documents  that  you had notarized and filed showing
            that you were a real church,
            ordination as a minister in the Church of Christ,
            and Bills advice on what to  do  if  the Feds or the State came
            after you for what ever reason.

       Bill's organization was based in San Diego and he normally  drove up
       to Orange County  for  meetings  twice  a  week.  Once  for the YHPA
       meeting (Thursdays) and once for the  meeting of the inner circle of
       the Church of  Christ.  His  organization was so over  swamped  with
       applications that he  began franchising other ministers so that they
       could sell church packets.

       The minister selling a church would  receive  50.00  and  the Bishop
       would received the other 450.00. Everything fair  and  square.  What
       was almost humorous  about  the  whole home church movement was that
       most of the  people  who  formed  churches  actually  became  fairly
       straight laced Christians.

       Groups of home churches would make treks to Mexico  on the week ends
       and deliver food  and  clothing to the homeless in Tiajuana. Several
       groups came together  and  bought   land   in   Mexico  and  started
       orphanages. So all  in  all,  I guess Bill Drexler  actually  was  a
       driving force that did some good.

       Anyway, the tax   movement   began  spreading  across  the  country.
       Different groups with difference philosophies  began springing up in
       most major cities.  Several  newspapers  were  created   and  people
       started joining the  movement.  We  knew  that when twenty or thirty
       percent of the people rebelled, the  government  would  be forced to
       abolish the immoral  income  tax  and  go  back to a  Constitutional
       consumption tax. What   the   movement   didn't  count  on  was  the
       resourcefulness of the state governments.

                                      Page 4





       Being an engineer  and  a self employed consultant, I and many other
       consultants in the movement, were  very  results oriented. We new we
       were on to something. And the something was that the  government had
       stolen the country and the Constitution from the people. Recapturing
       the government away  from  the  bureaucrats  and returning it to the
       people was going to be our revolution.

       We had the Constitution on our side and when everything went down we
       were going to  make  sure  that  the   elected   officials  and  the
       bureaucrats paid. We could see trials for crimes against  the people
       taking place and the Nuremberg defense was not going to work. It was
       obvious that the IRS was seizing property without due process and we
       were going to stop it.

       Early 1979 brought with it several seizures of accounts and property
       of members in  the  YHPA  and  other  organizations. The interesting
       thing that we saw however was that  the  news  media pandered to the
       IRS. If you  want  to  know  what  the  government   attaches   real
       importance to, watch  what  happens to a person arrested for murder.
       The government will fall all over  themselves  in  order  to protect
       that persons rights.

       They will provide them with an attorney, allow them  access  to  law
       libraries, and in  the  case  of  Randy  Craft (a serial murderer in
       Orange county California) provide  them with computers and a private
       investigator.

       Get yourself in Dutch with the IRS however, and you  can  have  your
       bank accounts seized,  your  property  taken away, and find yourself
       out on the street without a way to make a living.

       What would typically happen is the  IRS  or  the  FTB  would  target
       someone in order to make them an example. Their bank  accounts would
       be seized, their house and cars seized and sold at public action.

       About that time  they  usually  found  themselves  out  of a job. In
       California a large percentage of the  people worked in the Aerospace
       industry. A word in the right place would usually  result  in  a tax
       protester being laid off while the company was actively hiring.

       Husbands and wives  in the movement would usually come to an impasse
       when the prospect  of  being  on   the   street   was   present.  My
       observations of people attending the meetings was  that  wives  were
       much more militant  than  husbands.  But  what actually happened was
       that when someone went to the labor  camp  at  Lom  Poc (the Federal
       honor farm in California), it was usually the husband.

       Mom and the kids went off and found another Dad. I  also figured out
       the strategy of  the  FTD  and  the IRS. They would not confront the
       organizations head on  in  court.  That  could  set  the  stage  for
       national publicity and  would only allow the tax protesters  to  get
       their message out to the population as a whole.

       The element of  failure  was  much too great for that. What they did
       was go after  people  in  the  tax  courts  where  the  judges  were
       appointed by the  IRS.  In  order to refute IRS charges  and  claims
       against your assets,  you first have to exhaust your remedies in the
       regulatory courts (those courts run by the IRS).


                                      Page 5





       After that, you could go to the civil courts and sue to recover what
       ever the IRS stole from you. Sounds fair, right?  Wrong.

       The thing that was wrong with it that as soon as you set foot in the
       tax court, you  have  no assets. When the Feds get through with you,
       you would have to get major financing  to  buy a stamp from the post
       office. Get hit in an auto accident and Larry Parker  will represent
       you for free based on a projected settlement. Get hit by the IRS and
       no one will  represent  you  unless  you  can  pony up a substantial
       retainer.

       Consider this, at 150.00 per hour,  a  15,000  retainer  only buys a
       hundred hours of representation. That's less than three  weeks worth
       of work at 40 hours a week.

       About this time a gentleman from Arizona whose name I do not recall,
       came on the  scene.  His  program  said that instead of not filing a
       return, as opposed to the program  that  YHPA had, what we should be
       doing is filing fifth amendment returns. If you examine  the  bottom
       of your tax  return  you  will  see  that you are swearing under the
       penalty of perjury that everyone on the return is correct and true.

       What happens if something on the return  is not true? Right, you can
       be charged with  perjury  which carries about a 14  year  term.  The
       theory behind the  fifth  amendment  return is that you are invoking
       your fifth amendment rights against  self incrimination. The problem
       with this theory is that the courts have held that a fifth amendment
       return is the same as not filing a any return.

       Several people received free room and board at Phoenix  and  Lom Poc
       for following this program.

       Early in 1980  my  wife and I sold our house in California and moved
       to northern Arizona for a number  of  reasons.  I commuted back into
       California each Monday  morning  and  returned home  to  Arizona  on
       Thursday or Friday  night  of the same week. Over the course of four
       years I ran through four cars and a wife.

       Our problem started in 1982 when  the  state  of  California  levied
       against the company that I was consulting with. I know,  they  can't
       do that. But  the fact of the matter is that they did. What happened
       to the YHPA  organization that had  been  collecting  a  twenty-five
       dollar membership fee for the previous four years?

       Well, they had  given  several  hundred  thousand   dollars  to  two
       different groups of lawyers who really did nothing but posture in
       front of the  bench.  In  fact,  one  of  the  lawyers  who had been
       receiving money from the organization  for  several  years  withdrew
       from one of the cases when the IRS started auditing him.

       Did he feel obligated to return the money he had been taking for the
       previous two years? Right, get real. The lawyers  are  only  a small
       degree more or less honorable than the IRS.

       So there I  was  on  my  own. A friend who was being attacked at the
       same time found an elderly gentleman  by  the name of Art Porth. Art
       had a small  tax  organization in the San Gabriel area  of  Southern
       California. Art had  been  fighting  the income tax laws since 1930.
       His premise was that the revenue codes were unconstitutional. He had

                                      Page 6





       been thrown in  a  mental institution by a federal judge in the mid-
       1950s.

       The reason, the  judge declared  that  Art  was  insane  in  manners
       concerning the income tax. It took his wife over six  months  before
       she managed to find another federal judge to issue a writ to get him
       out of confinement.  Anyway,  Art  was  having some small success in
       having the wolfs called off of some people. The Feds began targeting
       Art's group when their numbers began growing and Art eventually left
       program when his health finally failed  (at  the  time I met Art, he
       was seventy five years old.).

       During this time I discovered that the State of California  was much
       more viscious than  the Federal Government when it came to taxes. In
       fact, we discovered that the IRS  would  inform  the  state that you
       were under suspicion. Because the State of California was constantly
       in need of money, they would go after you with a real vengeance. The
       State went after me and hounded me from one consulting  contract  to
       another.

       I found out later that they would talk to people at my last contract
       in order to  find  out  where  I went. Why would someone inform on a
       coworker? Simple, they were threatened with an audit if they did not
       corporate.

       One contracting agency was so dirty  with  their  own  tax situation
       that they actually contacted the FTB and offered me  up  in exchange
       for some consideration concerning their case.

       About this time  another  friend  came  back  into  the system.  His
       accounts had been levied against,  his  house  was  under  a seizure
       order and one of his cars had been stolen by the  IRS.  He  found  a
       former IRS agent  that  was  at  the  time  running a tax consulting
       business. The agent negotiated a deal  with the agency and my friend
       filed his back  returns  and  went  in  hock  to  make  the  penalty
       payments.

       I found a  lawyer  that  helped  me in the beginning but fell on her
       face several years  later.  My attorney  arranged  for  yet  another
       former IRS agent that now had a big time accounting  firm in Newport
       Beach California to prepare my returns.

       Additionally, she located  a  small company that had for all intents
       and purposes gone out of business  with  a  carry  forward  tax loss
       amounting to twenty some thousand dollars.

       The owners could  not  because of their own tax situation,  use  the
       loss. I bought  the  company  for about two thousand dollars in cash
       and used the carry forward to offset some penalties and interest.

       The way the tax game works is that  if  you owe any taxes and make a
       payment, the payment goes against old taxes, not current taxes. This
       works to the IRS advantage because you wind up taking a long time to
       pay off the 10% penalty and 10% interest per year compounded (that's
       really 20% a year).

       It took me  from  1983  until  1988 to pay off the  back  taxes  and
       penalties. The IRS  had  my  account  spread  around three different
       offices. I went through a similar deal with the state of California.

       At one time  the  state  had  been listed as armed and dangerous. My
       attorney had that taken off of the  computer.  If I had been stopped
       in traffic during this time I would have had some real  fun with the
       cops.

       Was all of  this  worth it? Well, I know what fighting for principal
       is all about. I know what stress will  do to a marriage. I know what
       driving 80 thousand miles a years will do to you. I  know  a hell of
       lot about hindsight. What did I gain?

       Well, the YHPA  organization  advised  people  to take the tax money
       they saved from being in the program  and  invest  it in property or
       precious metals to guard against the coming collapse of the country.

       I saved some  twenty thousand dollars a year for about  three  years
       and invested it  in  Arizona property, weapons, food and tools. What
       have I got to show for it? Not a damn  thing. My former wife enjoyed
       the fruits of the movements and now owns a house in Kingman Arizona,
       six or so  acres  of  property  on  the  Big Sandy river  with  some
       improvements, several hundred ounces of silver, and a lot more.

       I walked away  from  the marriage after she asked me to leave with a
       leased car, some personal weapons, and my clothing.

       The cost of my coming back into  the  system  amounted  to  about  a
       hundred grand paid to the state and federal governments  spread over
       five or six  years  in  addition  to paying normal taxes during that
       time. Additionally, I paid close  to  twenty  grand to attorneys and
       accountants. I currently  have  a new family and am  working  toward
       trying to rebuild what I lost during that period of my life.

       Would I advise  someone  else  to  enter  a  program to avoid paying
       taxes? Well, if you want to feel like  fighting for a good cause, go
       for it. But keep your eyes open. If the leaders of any movement tell
       you that they are doing this for the good of the country,  then  ask
       them why they  charge  any  more  for  the program than printing and
       living costs.

       Armon Condo was not making a great  deal  of  money  from  YHPA, but
       several other people in the program were. I will write another paper
       detailing what happened  to Armon Condo and Bill Drexler  and  their
       fortunes later.

       We ask that  you  please SHARE this file with anyone you know who is
       considering getting involved  in   such   a   process  as  UNTAXING.
       Although there is probably great validity to the claims,  there  are
       currently insufficient numbers  of people willing to get involved to
       make the attempt worthwhile when  one  takes  into consideration the
       above examples of concerted government harassment.
