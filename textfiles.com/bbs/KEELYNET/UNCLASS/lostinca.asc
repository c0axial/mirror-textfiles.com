       In 1927 William Montgomery McGovern, at the time Assistant Curator
       of the South American Ethnology Field Museum of Natural History, and
       a Member of the Board of Oriental Studies of London, wrote a volume
       titled 'JUNGLE PATHS AND INCA RUINS' (The Century Co., New York &
       London).  During his many years of travel and study in South America
       he came across some very interesting sites, though perhaps none so
       remarkable as the one described in pp. 437-438 of his volume, the
       ancient fort of Saksawaiman or Saksahuaman:
            "...Cuzco has indeed fallen from it's ancient high estate.  No
       longer is it the capital of a vast empire, far vaster than the
       limits of present-day Peru.  To-day it numbers only some thirty
       thousand souls, whereas the ancient city had more than TEN TIMES
       that number.  Most of the ancient palaces and temples have been
       destroyed by the Spaniards, but the main outlines of the city as it
       was in the days of the Incas can still be traced.
            "On a high hill to the north of the city lie the remains of the
       giant citadel and fortress of Saksawaiman, which dominated the city
       and guarded it against attack.  Three huge towers, the military
       residence of the Incas and their soldiers, were destroyed to provide
       building-stones for the Spaniards, the enormous stones of the triple
       ramparts still remain--stones far larger than a man's height and
       weighing many tons.  How were they brought there, and so accurately,
       so delicately, put into place?
            "Near the fortress are several strange caverns reaching far
       into the earth.  Here alters to the gods of the Deep were carved out
       of the living rock, and the many bones scattered about tell of the
       sacrifices which were offered up.  The end of one of these caverns,
       Chincana, has never been found.  It is supposed to communicate by a
       long underground passage with the Temple of the Sun, in the heart of
       Cuzco.  In this cavern is supposed to be hidden a large part of the
       golden treasure of the Inca emperors, which was stored away lest it
       fall into the hands of the Spaniards.  But the cavern is so huge and
       so complicated, and so manifold are its passages, that its secret
       has never been uncovered.
            "One man indeed is said to have found his way underground to
       the Sun Temple and, when he emerged, to have had two golden bars in
       his hand.  But his mind had been affected by days of blind wandering
       in the subterranean caves, and he died almost immediately afterward.
       Since that time many have gone into the cavern--never to return
       again.  Only a month or two before my arrival the disappearance of

       three prominent people in this Inca cave caused the prefect of the
       province of Cuzco to wall up the mouth of the cavern, so that the
       secret  of  the  treasures  of  the  Incas  seem  likely  to  remain
       undiscovered for the present."

       Alexander Von Humboldt, in his volume 'VIEWS OF NATURE' (London,
       Henry G. Bohn, 1850) relates on pp. 412-413 the following account
       which he collected while in Cuzco, Peru:
            "...The son of the Cacique Astorpilca, an interesting and
       amiable youth of seventeen, conducted us over the ruins of the
       ancient palace.  Though living in utmost poverty, his imagination
       was filled with images of the subterranean splendour and the golden
       treasures which, he assured us, lay hidden beneath the heaps of
       rubbish over which we were treading.  He told us that one of his
       ancestors once blind-folded the eyes of his wife, and then, through
       many intricate passages cut in the rock, led her down into the
       subterranean gardens of the Inca.  There the lady beheld, skillfully
       imitated in the purest gold, trees laden with leaves and fruit, with
       birds perched on their branches.  Among other things, she saw
       Atahuallpa's gold sedan-chair (UND DE LAS ANDAS) which is alleged to
       have sunk in the basin of the Baths of Pultamarca.  The husband
       commanded his wife not to touch any of these enchanted treasures,
       REMINDING HER THAT THE PERIOD FIXED FOR THE RESTORATION OF THE INCA
       EMPIRE HAD NOT YET ARRIVED, and that whosoever should touch any of
       the treasures would perish that same night.  (Note: This may or may
       not be the same as the legendary underground 'garden' cavern below
       the 'fort' referred to by some sources, through which is said to
       flow a large underground spring and which can only be entered by
       navigating a confusing labyrinth of underground tunnels.  This
       account would also seem to tie-in with various rumors that not only
       the Inca treasures, but many of the Incas themselves escaped the
       Conquistadors through ancient tunnels which led to vast cavern
       cities built in antediluvian times by the lost 'Atlantean' race.
       There are actually people who claim to have met these subterranean
       'Incas'.  One such person who alleged to have been descended from
       the Incas themselves, told the former editor of AMAZING STORIES
       magazine Raymond A. Palmer, that he had encountered one of these
       ancient 'cousins' of his who acted as a sentry or guard of a
       entrance to one of the underground abodes.  This entrance was in the
       form of a shaft which was situated on the top of a mountain peak
       somewhere in the Matto Grosso region of Brazil - Branton)
            "These golden dreams and fancies of the youth were founded on
       recollections and traditions transmitted from remote times.  Golden
       gardens, such as those alluded to (JARDINES O HUERTAS DE ORO), have
       been described by various writers who allege that they actually saw
       them; viz., by Cieza de Leon, Parmento, Garcilaso, and other early
       historians of the Conquista.  They are said to have existed beneath
       the Temple of the Sun at Cuzco, at Caxamarca, and in the lovely
       valley  of  Yucay,  which  was  a  favorite  seat  of  the sovereign
       family...
            "The son of Astorpilca assured me that underground, a little to
       the right of the spot on which I then stood, there was a large
       Datura tree, or Guanto, in full flower, exquisitely made of gold
       wire and plates of gold, and that its branches overspread the Inca's
       chair.  The morbid faith with which the youth asserted his belief in
       this fabulous story, made a profound and melancholy impression on
       me."
