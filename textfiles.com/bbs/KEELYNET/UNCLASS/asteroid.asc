                               THE END OF A CHAPTER?
                               ---------------------

       As all our  information media continue to bombard us with depressing
       reports about the Ozone Layer; the  "Greenhouse Effect"; the melting
       Ice-Caps and the  rising seas; the rapid loss of the  Earth's  great
       tropical rain-forests; the  massive  pollution  of  land and sea and
       atmosphere; the terrifying overpopulation  of  the Earth by Man, the
       Great Predator; and the accelerating destruction of  numerous  other
       species of life,  it  is  evident  that  many - even among the great
       unthinking masses of  humanity -  are  beginning  to  preceive  that
       "SOMETHING IS HAPPENING".

       And, here and there among them, the more perceptive  ones  are  even
       starting to see  that the close of one of the "Great Chapters in the
       Book of Life on Earth" may be at  hand.   Should  this indeed be so,
       then it is  nothing new!  For these things have occurred  repeatedly
       before.

       For what we  are discussing is "Catastrophism", and we know that the
       old-fashioned Victorian idea of "Gradualism", once so dear to the

                                      Page 1





       hearts of such  folk  as  the  geologist Lyall, has now been totally
       discarded.  Today we already know  from  the scientific evidence, of
       at least 77 reversals of the Earth's Poles.

       Firstly, there is  the  problem  of  the  actual  wandering  of  the
       physical Poles, and  this  is  no  doubt  connected  with  the  slow
       processes of Continental Drift and the movements of the Plates.

       Secondly, as stated already, there  is  the question of the magnetic
       reversals.  It seems that there have been twenty  of  these  in  the
       last 4,500,000 years,  which  gives  us a rate of about one reversal
       every 200,000 years, on an average.

       There have been found to be several  sorts  of time-interval between
       them. One of the intervals is of about 700,000 years,  while another
       is of about  only 10,000 years.  The longest interval yet discovered
       by our scientists happens to be in  fact OUR CURRENT interval, as it
       seems that the last big reversal was about 690,000 years ago, though
       the scientists Folgheraiter and Mercanton have also  found  a  brief
       period of reversal about 3,000 years ago.

       Findings of scientists   in   the   Geological   Department  of  the
       University of Minnesota (published  in  the  London  Sunday Times of
       July 15, 1984) indicate that a new "flip" is indeed  pending.   They
       found that the  Earth's  magnetic  field has halved in strength over
       the past 4,000 years.  The actual  reversal may, the scientists say,
       "take a few years, or a couple of thousand if History is any guide".

       Clearly, when it does happen, magnetic compasses will be useless for
       navigation during the change, and the protection which  the  Earth's
       magnetic field at present gives us against solar radiation could be
       altered, no doubt bringing major changes in climate (such as we are
       already experiencing).

       Clearly, also, all  creatures that utilize the Earth's magnetism for
       their navigation - birds, fish, and honey bees for example - will be
       thrown into utter confusion and their survival will be in doubt.

       And what about ours? (Incidentally,  we  have  heard of all sorts of
       theories about the cause of extinction of the dinosaurs  -  such  as
       the explosion of  a  Supernova.   But  this  magnetic field reversal
       might also have been the cause.)

                        All Life Is Lived On A Razor's Edge

       All life is miraculous and perilous,  anyway,  and  we  live  on the
       razor's edge.  In  an  earlier article, "Will The  Earth  Be  Struck
       Again Soon?" (in  FSR  30/5, 1985), I gave an outline of the view of
       Dr.  Allen Hynek  and fellow astro-physicists  regarding  a  further
       danger with which our planet is faced - and has always  been faced -
       namely the possibility  of  another major strike soon by an asteroid
       or a comet, from which it seemed  pretty  evident  that  a good many
       astronomers think we might 'cop' something quite nasty  again before
       very long.

       Such a view   has  recently  received  much  confirmation.   In  his
       article, The Dynamics  of  Armageddon,   published  in  the  journal
       ASTRONOMY NOW, the Oxford University astrophysicist Dr. Victor Clube
       has pointed out that, since about 1970, the previous scientific

                                      Page 2





       thinking about the  likelihood of great geophysical disasters on our
       planet have been revised most drastically.   He  says that it is now
       perceived that, even within the tiny span of recorded  history,  the
       impact or near  passage  of  comets have had quite startling effects
       upon the Earth.

                 Comet Encke, And Another Near-Miss By An Asteroid

       Subsequently, on October 24, 1988, in an article in the London
       Daily Telegraph, Dr. Clube showed that, in particular, COMET ENCKE,
       which, with its million-mile swathe  of  debris  intercepts  Earth's
       orbit once every 3.3 years (!), represents a terrible danger to this
       planet, and he adduces cogent evidence to show that  in both the 5th
       century A.D., there  were  what he calls veritable "waves of attack"
       against the Earth by Encke.  He also  thinks, incidentally, that the
       famous "Tunguska Phenomenon"  of 1908 was almost certainly  a  large
       chunk of ice  about  40  yards  wide  and weighing some 30,000 tons,
       which had got detached from Encke's Comet.

       But now (Daily Telegraph, April 21,  1989)  we  learn that our Earth
       has just narrowly escaped being struck by a fresh,  totally unknown,
       asteroid weighing some 400,000,000 tons, which passed within half-a-
       million miles of us in March of this year!

       Dr. Henry Holt,  the  Northern  Arizona  University  astronomer  who
       discovered this "beastie",   using   the   Mount   Palomar   Optical
       Telescope, says that the thing had come in from the direction of the
       Sun, so that the Sun's glare had prevented anyone from detecting its
       approach sooner, and  that,  "If it had appeared only  a  few  hours
       earlier, it would have nailed us".

       "Half-a-million miles from Earth" mean that, as it passed us, the
       size of the  gap  separating the asteroid from us was only twice the
       distance from the Earth to the Moon.

       In 1937 the asteroid HERMES (400 million tons) also came within half
       a million miles of us.  If we are  to  go on having many such "close
       shaves", then assuredly it can only due to some Very High Guidance -
       in other words DIVINE PROVIDENCE.  But - can we always count on it?

       IF WE ARE WORTH PRESERVING, MAYBE SOMEBODY WILL CONTINUE  TO  SEE TO
       IT THAT WE ARE PRESERVED.

       As we contemplate  these  Immensities,  we realize more acutely than
       ever that ALL  OF LIFE IS LIVED  UPON  A  RAZOR'S  EDGE.   What  the
       purpose of our existence here is, not one of us knows, but we can be
       certain that we  are here because we are useful to  Somebody  or  to
       Something.  Let us  ever be thoughtful and mindful, then, for should
       we cease to be useful, might not our time be running out?

       What do all the signs indicate?  Are  we  not all living on borrowed
       time now?
