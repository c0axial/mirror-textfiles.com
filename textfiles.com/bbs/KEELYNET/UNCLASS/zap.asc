       Back in 1987,  after  hosting the 1st International Keely Symposium,
       we of Vangard Sciences were looking  for  some means of generating a
       stable income for carrying out research into the many subjects which
       were of interest to us.

       Chuck Henderson was  primarily  into the work of Wilhelm  Reich  and
       Orgone Energy.  He  had  in  mind  many  experiments regarding cloud
       busting, Orgone accumulators and the use of orgone in free energy or
       levitation modes.

       Ron Barker was more into the effects  of  pyramid  energy, UFO's and
       the uses of crystals and psychic energy.  This included equipment to
       enhance ones abilities.

       Jerry Decker was primarily into Keely with interests  in biology for
       healing and age reversal.

       Ron had spoken  with  Bob Wallace, Director of the Gates Planetarium
       in Denver regarding his lightning show ZAP!

       He told me of the discussion and  we  made  a deal with Bob to lease
       his 2.3 MV coil and setup for the lightning show.  We had it in mind
       to seek corporate sponsorship for public demonstrations  as  well as
       to do non-public experiments on our own.

       We also planned to try for a spot at the Texas State Fair to be held
       in October as  we  understood  that up to $500,000 could be made for
       the 3 week period of the fair.  We  hoped that anything we made from
       this could be  placed  in  trust  to  provide a continuing  interest
       payment without affecting the principal.  This funding would be used
       for our various research projects.

       As it turned  out,  no  corporations  were  interested  although  we
       received many letters.  We finally struck a deal with the owner of a
       closed movie theater to give the show a try for one month.

       After creating a special stage,  running  custom  220VAC  power  and
       shielding the inside  walls  with  chicken wire to  provide  Faraday
       shielding, we began  our  shows.  During that run, we only succeeded
       in attracting one newspaper article and one entertainment mention.


                                      Page 1





       Ron had spent  hours visting radio, TV and newspaper offices as well
       as many phone calls trying to elicit interest.

       We had numerous engineers and technical  types  attend  our one hour
       shows, even with a special group from Texas Power and Light.

       However much they   loved   the  show,  they  felt   it   would   be
       irresponsible to sponsor  a  show  that showed electricity streaming
       from ones fingers.   Never  mind   that  the  show  was  heavy  into
       explaining the safe use of electricity with all its  dangers and the
       Kids, don't try this at home warnings.

       As to technical  details  and  any phenomena that we noted, the coil
       had a maximum output of 2.3 million volts.  It used a rotating spark
       gap which was fan quenched.  It was tuned for 170 KHZ.

       By adjusting the distance between  the  spark gaps we could increase
       the output or decrease it as desired.  For the general  effects,  we
       used the full 2.3 MV and for the section where the Mr. ZAP character
       allowed the electricity  to run over his body, the power was reduced
       to 900,000 Volts.

       To get the best effects, the greatest  power  must  be  used so Ron,
       Chuck and I  each  stood on the platform to determine  how  much  we
       could handle without pain.  Chuck seemed to be most sensitive to the
       energy and would cringe at about 650 to 700 KV.

       Ron could take  up  to 800 KV while I had no problems running at 900
       KV.  Once, we cranked it up to 1  MV  but  I could only stand it for
       about 10 seconds.  It felt like you were vibrating,  rather jerking,
       but the worst  was  the  emission  of current from any pointed area.
       This actually burned the skin and  drilled  small  holes  which were
       black on inspection.

       Of course, this burning occurred anytime the energy  was  allowed to
       flow directly from  the  skin,  however,  the  electrical  potential
       determined the degree of burn and thus the pain level.

       The show used a narrator, Wayne Fowler  who  had  memorized a script
       relating the facts of Tesla's life and which was  all  sequenced  to
       the actions of the Mr. Zap character.

       We included as   much   spectacle   as   possible,   from   roasting
       marshmallows with lighting to be  fed  to  the  audience, to letting
       them hold fluourescent tubes while the machine was energized.

       Two interesting anomalous observations that occurred  which might be
       of interest :

          1)  I  had  about 3 warts on my hands, one on my right thumb, one
              on my left index finger and  another  on  my left wrist.  Now
              warts are caused by viruses which are known  to  be destroyed
              by high levels of oxygen.  These had been present for years.

              After about two weeks of doing the ZAP program which involved
              the emission  of  lightning  from  metal caps attached to the
              fingers (ZAP3.GIF), I happened  to be at work and was using a
              screwdriver.  Something did not feel the same and I looked


                                      Page 2





              down to  see that ALL the warts were completely gone with not
              scars or visible trace that they had ever been.

         2)  To watch the energy streaming  off  the  skin is a fascinating
             display, and during the show we would separate  the fingers to
             provide multiple  paths  and  then  join them together to form
             rivers of plasma.

             I would at times allow the  energy  to  flow off my elbows and
             one day  while watching it flow from my right  elbow  with  an
             audience in  attendance,  I noticed these small yellow spheres
             mixed in with the outflowing streams.

             These yellow spheres were about  1/8  to  1/4 inch in diameter
             and all were identical as to color, intensity  and size.  They
             appeared to  jump  off  the  skin  fully  created.   I  was so
             entranced that for about a minute  I forgot about the audience
             while viewing the spheres.

             After the  show,  I  discussed it with Ron and  Chuck  and  we
             decided it  could  be  one  of two things.  Either it was ball
             lightning or  it  was energized  salt  particles  that  glowed
             yellow due to the sodium.  I should explain here  that we used
             two bottles  of water, one was highly saturated with salt, the
             other was distilled.  This was  because  energy when resisted,
             generates heat, so we wanted the greatest energy transfer from
             the electrical cable into our feet yet we did not wish to burn
             up our hair.

             For that reason, we sprayed the salt solution  on our feet and
             the metal  plate  yet  sprayed the distilled water on our hair
             and head to prevent burning.

             We thought  it possible that  the  spheres  could  be  ionized
             bubbles of salt, either generated from body  salt  or  through
             careless applicaton of the salt spray.

             So the  next  day,  I  made  sure that absolutely sure that no
             extraneous salt spray had come in contact with anything but my
             feet.  When we lit up the machine, the bubbles appeared again.

             One further point, these bubbles  DID  NOT  APPEAR  until  the
             power level reached or exceeded approximately 800 KV.

       There is another file on KeelyNet which had a direct bearing on this
       project, and that  is  the  files  HARDY1.ASC  based  on  the  image
       HARDY1.GIF.  We hoped  that such a large Tesla coil would yield much
       more spectacular results.  However,  we  did  not  get the chance to
       carry out this experiment while in the theater setting.
