                          WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN MOSCOW
                                  By Bill Doares

       Shortly after his   tanks  set  Russia's  Parliament  House  ablaze,
       President Boris Yeltsin called up Bill Clinton. According to a White
       House spokesperson, Yeltsin "reassured"  the U.S. president that "an
       obstacle to reform and democracy has been removed."

       Most of Russia's elected legislators were in prison. Newspapers that
       disagreed with Yeltsin were banned. So were most  of  the  country's
       political parties. Hundreds  of  protesters had been shot; thousands
       were arrested. And Yeltsin was preparing  to  ban the Constitutional
       Court.

       Clinton was pleased. Russia, he declared at a press conference, is
       "on the path to democracy."

       BEHIND THE HEADLINES

       The corporate U.S.  news  media  joined with Clinton  in  trying  to
       justify Yeltsin's Hitler-like  measures.  With  little  variation in
       language, their headlines  and sound  bites  hailed  this  reign  of
       terror as a  "defense  of  democracy."  Time magazine  called  those
       opposed to Yeltsin "a drunken mob of hardliners." The New York Times
       one-upped them with "a noxious crowd of thugs."

       It turns out  on  closer  look  that  the "armed thugs" were tens of
       thousands of workers whose lives  are  being  shattered by Yeltsin's
       capitalist "reforms." The proof of this can actually be found tucked
       away in the capitalist newspapers themselves.

       For instance, there  was Olga Yeskina, a 46-year-old  engineer,  who
       told New York  Newsday  (Sept.  26)  she  was there because: "Once a
       young person in our country could  pick  any road he chose. Once the
       elderly always had their own homes. Now we have lost  all  of  this.
       The youth have   lost  their  future,  and  the  elderly  have  lost
       everything."

       Dmitri Dolgikh, an oil-field worker from Siberia, flew to Moscow to
       demonstrate against Yeltsin. Interviewed in his hospital bed after
       being shot by Yeltsin's troops, Dolgikh told the Washington Post
       (Oct. 6): "I'm against capitalism now that I've seen it."

       Russia's elected Parliament  wouldn't  agree  to  Yeltsin's plans to
       rapidly turn state-owned industry  over  to  Western  investors.  So
       Yeltsin "abolished" the  Parliament.  He cut off Parliament  House's
       heat, water and  electricity  and  surrounded  it  with troops. When
       thousands of workers,  many  of  them  elderly  retirees,  protested
       Yeltsin's actions, they were brutally assaulted by  the  real  armed
       thugs--the OMON riot police.

       EARLIER BLOODY CLASHES

       Writing in the   Oct.  10  European,  Moscow-based  reporter  Vitali
       Vitaliev said, "For some reason the  clashes  of Yeltsin's OMON with
       the still peaceful  anti-Yeltsin protesters in Moscow  on  Sept.  30
       [three days before  the  events  at  the  White  House] went largely
       unreported in the West. The scuffles  were  at  the Barrikadnaya and
       Pushkinskaya metro stations,  quite  a  distance   from   Parliament
       House."

       Describing live reports  on  Moscow  radio,  Vitaliev told how "OMON
       daredevils were picking up the weakest and oldest in the crowd and
       beating them up. 'What are they doing?' the reporter was screaming.
       'An OMON thug has just rushed at an elderly woman on the escalator
       and broken her leg!' The chairman of the Cheryomushkinsky district
       council, who was  passing,  was pushed  to  the  ground  and  kicked
       unconscious by OMON men."

       On Oct. 3, after days of such outrages, tens of thousands of workers
       armed only with sticks responded to a call by Labor Russia and other
       communist organizations and marched on the Parliament building. They
       put Yeltsin's goons to flight. They then marched to  the  central TV
       station, which had  barred  anti-Yeltsin  views,  and demanded to be
       allowed on the air. Yeltsin's forces  opened  fire  on the marchers,
       killing dozens.

       Said oil worker  Dolgikh,  "When  we  were across  the  street,  the
       shooting started. I  thought  they  were shooting in the air, but it
       was at the  people.  In the first  volley  I  was  hit.  The  bullet
       penetrated my intestines."

       The massacre at the TV tower began a reign of terror. Early on Oct.4
       Yeltsin's tanks opened fire on Parliament House.  They  kept  firing
       for hours, although  the  legislators  ordered  their meagerly armed
       defenders not to shoot back. The Oct.  5 Moscow Tribune, an English-
       language pro-Yeltsin daily,  reported  that  Yeltsin's  troops  were
       shooting "in all  directions"  and  that  a number of civilians were
       hit.

       Russia's largest newspaper, the pro-Yeltsin daily Izvestia, admitted
       in an Oct. 6 headline, "Troops Near  the White House Shot Everything
       That Moved." At  least 190 people were killed, almost  all  of  them
       anti-Yeltsin protesters. Some 1,500 arrested anti-Yeltsin protesters
       "underwent 'filtration' on  the  field  of Malaya Sports Arena," the
       European reported. The  majority   of  Moscow's  City  Council  were
       arrested.

       During the next   few   days  the  Yeltsin  regime  banned   Pravda,
       Sovietskaya Rossiya, Molnya  and  other  opposition  newspapers.  It
       banned Russia's largest   political    party,   the   600,000-member
       Communist Party of the Russian Federation, along with the Russian

                                      Page 2





       Communist Workers Party,   Labor  Russia,  the  Union  of  Communist
       Parties of the  Soviet  Union,  the  National  Salvation  Front  and
       parliamentary leader Aleksandr Rutskoi's Party of Free Russia.

       FASCIST-STYLE WITCHHUNT

       A witchhunt was  launched  in  the  search  for opposition  leaders,
       especially Victor Anpilov of Labor Russia and the Russian Communist
       Workers Party. Anpilov  was  arrested  near  Tula on Oct. 7. Charges
       against the parliamentary and working-class leaders are pending, and
       will probably be serious.

       Clinton, Yeltsin and the bankers  and  businessmen  behind  them may
       hope that by crushing Parliament they have cleared  the  way for the
       wholesale takeover of  Russia  by  U.S. corporations. But there is a
       much bigger obstacle in their way:  Russia's  multinational  working
       class. And it is just beginning to fight.

       In its article on Dolgikh, the Washington Post wrote, "The battle in
       Moscow's streets this week was won by Yeltsin and his  army.  But if
       Dolgikh is any  indication,  the  vanquished may rise again to fight
       another day.

       " 'I don't think this was a fatal blow' to the anti-Yeltsin forces,
       he said of the battle at the Parliament  building.  He  said that as
       soon as bread prices rise, which is expected to occur in the coming
       weeks, the anti-Yeltsin forces will see their numbers multiply."
