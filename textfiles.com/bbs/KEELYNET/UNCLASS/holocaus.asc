                                Holocaust Revised?

       Dr. Franciszek Piper, Senior Curator and Director of Archives at the
       Auschwitz State Museum,  has  revealed  to a Jewish  researcher  (on
       camera) that "Krema  I",  the  gas  chamber  shown  to  hundreds  of
       thousands of tourists each year at  the  Auschwitz  main camp, is in
       fact a reconstruction, fabricated after the war by  the Soviet Union
       - apparently on the direct orders of dictator Josef Stalin.

       This is a very sensitive issue.  So sensitive, in fact, that to even
       suggest the gassings  never  happened  carries  a  jail  sentence in
       countries like France, Canada, Germany, and Austria.

       There are a growing number of academics  worldwide who are trying to
       encourage accurate and open-minded research into the Holocaust.

       'Revisionists', as these people refer to themselves  (the media call
       them neo-Nazi, right-wing  scumbags),  are  discovering that Russian
       war records, now becoming available  with  the  collapse of the Iron
       Curtain, are supporting their claims.

       For example, the official number of gassing victims  at Auschwitz is
       now 1.1 million, whereas it used to be 4.1 million people.
