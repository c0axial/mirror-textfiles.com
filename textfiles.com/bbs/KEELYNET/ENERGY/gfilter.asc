                          VEHICLE GASOLINE FUEL PURIFIER

              Remove the impurities that the refineries leave in ....

       Clean burn gasoline promotes:

            o  Better Combustion

            o  More Power

            o  Better Mileage

            o  Cleaner Emissions

       WARNING !!  -   This  project  involves cutting gasoline fuel lines,
       and is NOT recommended to those who  do not feel comfortable cutting
       fuel lines, making  leak  proof  connections  and   working  with  a
       volatile substance.

       This project was one of the most interesting, that I have ever done.
       I wish I  had more experience in chemistry so that the results could
       be tailored as desired.

       What we are doing, is making a charcoal  filter and installing it in
       the fuel line.   The particular type of charcoal used,  removes  the
       paraffins and varnishes  from  the  gasoline,  thus  making  it burn
       faster and more completely.  The  filter  is  installed  between the
       carburetor and fuel pump on carburated cars.  I have  never used one
       with fuel injection,  however  there  is  no  reason  not to, if one
       understands the fuel  pressures generated  by  the  fuel  pump,  and
       designs this project with that in mind.

       The information about  this  project, was obtained  from  a  retired
       petroleum engineer, who worked for a refinery in Tulsa, Oklahoma for
       25 years.  Refineries,  refine  gasoline  just  enough  to meet what
       government regulations require,  and  no  more.   This  is done as a
       matter of cost.

       Higher grade fuels   for   aircraft   and  other  high   performance
       requirements, are also  made,  but  at  a significantly higher cost,
       because of the additional refining required.

       Cracking or the  refining process for crude oil, uses heat to derive
       the many products, including gasoline  products.   There  is another
       way of separating the various elements, purely mechanical, using the
       properties of activated charcoal.

       One pound of activated charcoal, has the equivalent  of 6.4 acres of
       surface area.  Passing   the   gasoline   through  charcoal,  larger
       molecules of paraffin and varnishes,  are  trapped  in the charcoal,
       allowing only the smaller, lighter hydrocarbons to pass through.

       The activated charcoal used in the construction of this project is a
       coconut based charcoal, which has the particular properties  that we
       are looking for.   Dry  cleaning establishments use coconut charcoal
       as one of the methods they use to  keep  their  dry  cleaning  fluid
       clean, so they don't have to change it so often.

                               Construction Details

       The construction of the charcoal filter uses sealed,  PVC  pipe  and
       end caps.  The  filter  can be made up of steel pipe, using the same
       dimensions and sizes  described.    The  filter  will  be  effective
       approximately for 2500  to  3000  miles before the charcoal  becomes
       saturated with impurities   and   loses  its  ability  to  trap  the
       paraffins and varnishes.

       When the filter has become saturated  with  paraffins and varnishes,
       the filter will not stop gasoline flow, however.   You  will  notice
       that performance is not what it had previously been.

       It is recommended  that the very first filter be built using the PVC
       pipe.  If you are satisfied with the  results, consider building one
       out of steel  pipe  and  threaded  end  caps, so that  the  charcoal
       cartridge may be replaced, at the same time you change your oil.

       Material Requirements:

            1 pound of activated coconut charcoal.  12X30 Mesh.

            (1 lb. of charcoal will make 2 filters)

            1 Womens  knee  high or panty hose style Nylon stocking.  (Used
              to contain the charcoal catalyst material)

            1 Can of PVC or ABS Bonding Adhesive

            1 Can or Bottle of Plastic Cleaner.

            Length of 5/16 gas line hose.

            Standard, replaceable fuel line  filter  to be installed before
            the carburetor  or  injectors,  to  catch  any  loose  charcoal
            particles.

            Worm gear clamps.

                               ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTION

       Take the 7  inch sleeve, check ends for burrs and uneven spots after
       cutting, and smooth them out. Then  set  the sleeve on work bench to
       prepare for packing the charcoal catalyst.

       Take the NYLON  panty hose (one of the legs), check  and  make  sure
       that there are   no  holes  or  runners.   The  Nylon  hose,  is  an
       inexpensive method to contain the  catalyst  bed.  Tie a knot in one
       end of the nylon hose, and cut off the excess.  Then insert the tied
       end, into the top opening of the PVC sleeve, until  it  touches  the
       bottom.  Allow 4 or 5 inches of nylon hose to protrude above the top
       of the PVC sleeve.  (This creates a funnel effect)

       Then take the catalyst carbon material using a paper cup as a scoop,
       pour the carbon  catalyst  into the nylon hose.  It may be necessary
       to use a funnel if your hand isn't  steady.   Fill  the  nylon  hose
       carefully, making sure  that  the carbon catalyst is  spreading  out
       evenly within the  sleeve.   Tapping on the sleeve body with a screw
       driver or similar tool while filling,  will help the carbon catalyst
       settle and pack.  After the sock is completely full,  draw the loose
       end and tie  a  knot  in it as close and tight as possible.  Cut off
       the surplus.  Be careful not to puncture the nylon material.

       Take two pieces of light gauge steel band (the type that is used for
       strapping of wooden crates) 3/8 inch  width,  cut  square  1/16 inch
       longer than the inside width of the PVC sleeve.  (These  are used as
       the carbon catalyst  bed,  retainers).   After  cutting the bands to
       size, wrap them with plastic electrical tape.  Insert one strip into
       each end of the PVC sleeve on a angle,  and  force  them against the
       tied nylon hose ends within the PVC sleeve.  These  bands  will lock
       into place holding  with  their  sharp corners and retain the carbon
       catalyst bed from shifting.

       The steel bands should bow-inward,  toward the middle of the sleeve.
       The PVC sleeve  is  now  a complete cartridge ready  for  the  final
       assembly.  Drill a  5/16  inch  hole in the center of both end caps.
       Using a 1/8 inch pipe tap, thread  each  cap  from  outer surface to
       only half length  of  the  tap,  to  allow  for a tight  fit.  (This
       procedure applies only when using PVC or plastic material).

       Use a plastic  cleaner and a clean rag, wipe both ends of the sleeve
       and the inner  rim of the end caps,  making  sure  they  are  clean.
       Allow the area to dry.  Apply bonding cement to the inner sides of

                                      Page 3





       the end caps  and  sleeve  ends.  Slip the end caps over the ends of
       the sleeve and rotate while forcing the unit together.  Allow to dry
       for two hours.  Assemble the brass fittings to the threaded end caps
       using a pipe thread compound.  Cut  two  pieces  of 5/16 inch copper
       tubing 3 inches  long,  and  insert  one in each brass  fitting  and
       tighten.

       Neoprene fuel lines  can  now  be attached to the filter.  (For fuel
       injected engines - Make sure that  the  hose  you use, can withstand
       the pressures of the fuel pump - Don't skimp!)

       Mounting Instructions:

       The filter should be mounted vertically, with the  input  hose  from
       the fuel pump,  going  into  the  TOP of the filter.  Mount the unit
       under the hood of the vehicle, preferably  in  the space between the
       radiator and the front grill.

       If no space  is available there, mount it in the engine  compartment
       away from the  exhaust  manifolds.   Most  installation  made in the
       engine compartment are mounted on wall of the inside fender area.  A
       simple bracket can be made for mounting, using an ordinary worm gear
       hose clamp around the sleeve body.

       NOTE :  When gasoline goes into the unit for the first time, the
               filter becomes hot, because of the catalytic reaction of the
               gasoline and charcoal.  After  a  moment,  the purifier will
               become cool, and will remain so thereafter.

       For people who need a racing fuel:

       Build the filter as described, but with the following
       exceptions:

       You can make  your  own racing fuel by making the filter  24  inches
       long, and manually  pouring  untreated gasoline through it, catching
       the treated fuel in a gasoline container.   You can make just enough
       fuel you will need for race day.

       I suggest that you make a floor stand for the filter,  with a funnel
       arrangement at the  top.   The  longer length will provide much more
       filtering, providing a very volatile  fuel.   Of  course,  this will
       require more charcoal in the making of the filter.  Be sure that you
       install a standard   fuel   filter  to  catch  any  loose   charcoal
       particles.  I like using the paper type element, fuel filters.

         BE SAFE.....DOUBLE CHECK ALL CONNECTIONS AND FITTINGS FOR LEAKS.
