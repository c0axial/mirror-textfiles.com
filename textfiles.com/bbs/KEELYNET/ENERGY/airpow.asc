  Scientists know that air molecules move about randomly at about 500 m/s,
  which is faster than the speed of sound, even in sub-zero weather.  Because
  air molecules have so much energy, free power can be obtained from the
  atmosphere.

  I have written a 22 page report which shows how free power can be obtained
  from the random motion of air molecules.  The technical report contains
  many equations and some drawings.  If you have any questions, or if you
  want to receive a copy of the report, send me a message [74213,2646].  The
  rest of this file is a copy of the report's introduction:

  Usually  power  is  obtained  by  burning  fossil  fuels  or  by  using
  hydroelectricity, or from a nuclear power plant.  But there are many other
  sources of power; for example, wind power and solar power.  This report
  describes a new source of power: thermal-gradient power.  A thermal
  gradient occurs naturally in the earth's atmosphere.

  Although it is easy for people on the ground to assume that the atmosphere
  is isothermal, the lower atmosphere is actually warm at the bottom and cold
  at the top.  Aircraft pilots are familiar with the variation of temperature
  with altitude because they must deal with low air temperatures at high
  altitudes.  Gravity causes the thermal gradient in the atmosphere because
  air molecules lose energy as they move higher in the atmosphere.  This
  report presents a theory to explain how and why a thermal gradient occurs
  in the atmosphere.

  Because a thermal gradient can occur in a gas which is in a rotating
  vessel, this report also presents a theory to explain how centrifugal force
  can cause a thermal gradient. Thermal-gradient power can, in theory, be
  obtained from the atmosphere by using heat from air which is near the
  ground.  A heat engine can use that heat to generate power, and then it can
  exhaust its waste heat into the cold air which exists at high altitudes.

  Power generation causes a reduction in the average temperature of the
  atmosphere, but the atmospheric thermal gradient is not destroyed by
  harnessing it to produce power; the thermal gradient is continuously
  restored by the random motions of air molecules.  Therefore, utilization
  of the thermal gradient is actually a utilization of atmospheric thermal
  energy.

  Since the sun keeps the atmosphere at a constant average temperature,
  thermal-gradient power is a renewable resource.  The atmospheric thermal
  gradient violates the second law of thermodynamics because the random
  motions of air molecules can maintain it without sunlight.  Because the
  atmospheric thermal gradient is real, the second law must be flawed.

  Exposing that flaw is a main objective of this report because, until now,
  scientists have been unable to find a flaw in the second law.  By studying
  the atmosphere we can understand exactly how and why the second law of
  thermodynamics is flawed.

  Re: Free Energy from Air

  Hello Craig:

       I forgot to put my name in the file.  The simplist way to get the rest
  of the report is by mail.  The report contains equations and drawings so it
  is best to mail it to you.

       Currently I am charging $15 to cover the cost of postage ($2.16) and
  photocopying and the costs of writing the report.  If you mail me $15 U.S.
  cash or check or money order then I will mail you the technical report.

  The address you should send the $15 to:   FREE POWER
                                            12137-96 St.,
                                            Edmonton, Alberta T0G-0P0
