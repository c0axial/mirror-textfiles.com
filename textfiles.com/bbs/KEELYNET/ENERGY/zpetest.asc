                ZPETEST.ASC  Zero Potential Energy Test Circuit

           by Chris Terraneau                       9 February 1994

             A number of KeelyNet callers have been experimenting with
             various circuits trying to tap the Zero-Potential energy. I
             have personally designed and built many conventional
             Switching Power Supplies which utilize circuits similar to
             those described in TOD.ZIP and COILBAK.ZIP.

             Several KeelyNetters have initially reported greater than
             unity outputs, only to realize later that some measurements
             may have been done in a manner which obscures what's really
             happening.

             I want to alert everyone to the fact that basically, what
             you MIGHT be actually building is called a FLYBACK
             CONVERTER, Figure 1. In conventional (less than unity)
             circuits, a switch (FET1) is closed for a period of time.
             Current ramps up in the inductor L1, as does the increasing
             magnetic field.

             At some point, FET1 is turned off. The collapsing magnetic
             field in inductor L1 causes a reversal of polarity in the
             voltage across it. This reverse voltage can easily be 10 to
             20 times the input voltage to the circuit.

             What is important to note here is that although the circuit
             has increased the VOLTAGE several times, it has DECREASED
             the current. An INCREASE in VOLTAGE is not the same as an
             INCREASE in POWER if the current has fallen. (P = E x I).

             In some of the circuits I have seen posted here,
             experimenters are advised to use a voltmeter to read a pulse
             voltage. This does not work ! A very GOOD oscilloscope is
             ESSENTIAL if you're going to determine power in a pulse
             circuit where P = E x I x T, where T is Time. Use a 'scope
             with AT LEAST 100 MHz bandwidth.

             It would be far easier to store these 'spurts' of
             voltage/current in a capacitor, and then measure the DC

                                    Page 1





             output power. If a large enough capacitor is used, T can be
             ignored completely (at least as far as measuring output
             power is concerned).

             Further, FLYBACK-produced current is NOT what you're after !
             A reverse voltage, which is typical of flyback output,
             indicates that you have STORED energy in an INDUCTOR in its
             MAGNETIC FIELD.

             To extract the Zero-Point energy according to Bearden, NO
             CURRENT must flow in your collection element during the
             'charging' time. If no current flows, NO MAGNETIC FIELD is
             generated either. Subsequently, no collapsing field results,
             and no reverse-polarity flyback pulse is generated.

                                    Page 2





             Instead, your collection element is 'charged' by ATTEMPTING
             to flow current in a conductor such as a long length of
             wire, POSSIBLY, but not necessarily, in a coiled form. See
             Figure 2.

             As an example, use a length of wire 1000 feet long. Switch a
             voltage from a battery across it for a period of time that
             is LESS than what is needed for CURRENT to begin flowing. At
             about 1 foot per nanosecond, you'll need less than 1
             microsecond.  When the switch (FET1) is opened, there will be
             no flyback (reverse polarity) pulse, because NO current flowed
             while FET1 was ON, so NO magnetic field was built-up.

             NOW, connect storage capacitor C2 (by switching ON FET2)
             across the length of wire, and 'capture' Zero-Potential
             energy.  You can do this at any frequency you like, from 60 Hz
             to several hundred Kilohertz. Just don't leave FET1 on long
             enough for current to begin flowing in the conductor.

             Use the capacitor (C2) to AVERAGE the product of Time,
             Voltage and Current. Load the capacitor with a load resistor
             (R3) and measure the voltage and current flowing in it.
             Calculate the resulting power with P = E x I.

             There are a number of concerns relating to 'stray'
             capacitance. This is one reason to use a long loop of wire
             instead of a coil. With a coil, there is a continuous
             'capacitor' formed where each loop of wire comes into close
             proximity to the other loops.

             This stray capacitance will draw a spike of current at the
             instant FET1 is switched on. The energy lost charging this
             capacitance MIGHT NOT be recoverable. A long loop of wire,
             like stretching it out along the periphery of your backyard,
             eliminates much of this capacitance. Also you'll want to
             suspend it away from the ground and other objects to reduce
             capacitance.

             The only advantage to a coil is reduced size. Remember, you
             don't want a magnetic field anyway. Winding a bucking coil,
             with half the turns clockwise and the other half counter-
             clockwise, DOES NOT solve the capacitance problem. It only
             cancels the generation of a magnetic field, which you're not
             going to get anyhow because FET1 will not be ON long enough.

             Now, a little about FETs. These are transistors which have a
             large capacitance between their leads. Watch out for this,
             or it might be interpreted as zero-potential energy. The G
             to S capacitance is usually the largest value, but D to G
             and D to S are also significant.

             FET1 should turn OFF before FET2 turns ON. And, FET2 should
             turn OFF before FET1 turns ON again. If this isn't done,
             part of the potential which is 'charging' your collection
             element 'leaks' into your load resistance. D1 and D2 and R1
             and R2 reduce the possibility of this happening by
             controlling the turn-on and turn-off times of the FETs. Try
             1000 ohms for R1 and R2. D1 and D2 should be Shottky diodes,
             such as 1N5711.

             Diode D3 blocks the C2 potential which has been accumulated
             from bleeding back into L1 AFTER it has given up its zero-
             point energy. Using a Shottky diode for D3 improves
             efficiency because of its lower forward drop and fast
             switching times.

             To test for turn-on / turn-off related inefficiencies,
             disconnect the collection element, L1, and measure input
             current. I got about 2 mA at + V = 15V. This loss is
             probably due to capacitance losses in the FETs themselves.
             Upon re-connecting the collection element, you'll see an
             increase in the input current. The stray capacitance is
             causing this, and you want this increase to be as small as
             possible.

             By the way, the driving pulse generator, which can be the
             555 with inverter stage from TOD.ZIP, should provide sharp
             rising and falling FULL VOLTAGE (0 to + V) pulses. If it
             doesn't, circuit efficiency (or over-efficiency) will
             suffer. This limits + V to about 20 volts for most FETs.

             I'm including Figure 3, which is a 3525 Regulating Pulse
             Width Modulator chip used as a driver. Since it has an

                                    Page 4





             active pull-up and pull down output circuit, it works fairly
             well down to 1 uS pulse widths. You can also easily adjust
             the frequency and pulse width with trimmers.

             Sadly, I was not able to achieve any free energy with this
             circuit. I think this is because the capacitive losses in my
             coil of wire and / or those in the FETs is greater than that
             recovered from the collection element. I think the only way
             such a circuit is going to work is when the collection
             element is a VERY LONG length of wire with VERY little stray
             capacitance, i.e. NOT a coil (or better yet, that mysterious
             'degenerative' material Bearden spoke of).
