        Notes from Jed Rothwell:

        1. This document is intended to augment the Fusion Technology paper
           by Mills & Kneizys. Fusion Technology is carried in many major
           libraries, for  example,  the  Boston  Public  Library,  and the
           M.I.T.  science library.

        2. Subscripts are shown with square brackets: H[2]O.

        Purpose:

        Many people have heard of the light water excess energy experiment
        reported by Mills and Kneizys in Fusion Technology. (1) By January,
        1992, this excess energy effect had been reproduced by at least a
        half-dozen other groups.

        Even though  the  experiment  is   simple   and  apparently  highly
        reproducible, many would-be experimenters might  be  deterred  from
        trying it  because  of  the well-known history of difficulties with
        the heavy  water palladium-platinum  approach  of  Fleischmann  and
        Pons.

        Even though Mills et al do not think that their  excess  energy  is
        due to  "cold fusion" -- they have an elaborate theory of shrinking
        hydrogen atoms  to explain the excess  power  --  their  experiment
        _was_ inspired by the Fleischmann-Pons announcement.

        The purpose of this brief collection of experimental protocols is


                                      Page 1





        to encourage  others  to  try  the  Mills experiment and perhaps go
        beyond it in their investigations.

        How to Begin

        The first order of business is to read the experimental part of the
        Mills-Kneizys paper in Fusion Technology to familiarize yourself
        with the basic approach.

        Don't try any fancy pulsed input power in the beginning. Stick with
        continuous (DC) input power. Don't  be  concerned  either about the
        exotic theory of Mills and Kneizys.  Their theory  may  be wrong or
        right, but  it's the validity of the experiment that's important at
        the moment. Other theories -- including  "conventional" cold fusion
        mechanisms working with the trace amount of deuterium  --  might be
        invoked to   explain   the   excess  energy  in  this  light  water
        experiment.

        Conditions that should be employed:

        1. The volume of solution could be from 100 ml to 1,000 ml in a
           vacuum-jacketed glass dewar cell. Note: Some people have tried a
           non-dewar cell -- a heavily insulated glass beaker with plastic
           materials to give the same insulating  dewar  effect.  The  cell
           should be closed at the top with a tapered rubber stopper.

        2. The  electrolyte  should  be:  0.6 M aqueous K[2]CO[3]  of  high
           purity.

        3. The electrolyte should be stirred continuously with a magnetic
           stirring bar to ensure temperature uniformity.

        4. The nickel cathode does not apparently have to have the exact
           configuration of the "spiral wound" sheet described by Mills-
           Kneizys in their paper. It could be just a flat sheet of nickel,
           but the  ratio  of the _total surface area_ (i.e. both sides) of
           the nickel cathode to the surface  area  of  the  platinum anode
           should be no less than 20/1.

        5. The anode is of platinum wire, 1 mm diameter. Mills and Kneizys
           used a spiral-shaped piece 10 cm long.

        6. Above all, avoid impurities and contamination of the cell
           materials, whether in handling or in environmental conditions.
           Particularly insure that no organic contaminants are in the cell
           or on the electrodes. (Don't forget that remnant soap film could
           be a problem!)

        7. Dr. V.C. Noninski, who has replicated this light water work (2),
           recommends:

           "Before starting the experiment, mechanically scour the platinum
            anode with  steel wool, soak overnight in concentrated  HNO[3],
            and then  rinse with distilled water. Remove the nickel cathode
            from its container with rubber  gloves,  and cut and bend it in
            such a  way that no organic substances are transferred  to  the
            nickel surface.

            Preferably, dip the nickel cathode into the working solution

                                      Page 2





            under an  electrolysis  current,  and _avoid leaving the nickel
            cathode in  the  working  solution   in   the   absence  of  an
            electrolysis current._"

        8. Before attempting to run the cell to demonstrate excess energy,
           reverse the  cell  polarity for about one-hour  to  anodize  the
           nickel cathode.  However,  Professor  John  Farrell of the Mills
           group has said that 0.5 hour of  this  treatment is adequate. He
           says this "electropolishes the Ni."

        9. Use distilled H[2]O.

        10. There have been claims and counter claims about whether the
            experiment will  work  in "closed-cell" mode with  a  catalytic
            recombiner. Begin your work without one to be on the safe side.
            Professor Farrell   and,   independently,   Dr.  Noninski  have
            measured the oxygen and hydrogen  evolution in the absence of a
            recombiner and  find  these  gases in the expected  quantities,
            i.e. unsuspected  recombination is NOT causing the excess power
            effect.

        11. The current density on the cathode should be on the order of
            _one milliamp per square centimeter_. This is very low compared
            to the Pons-Fleischmann heavy water experiments.

        12. To calibrate the cell, introduce a pure resistance heating of
            known power by using a 100 ohm  precision  resistor  encased in
            teflon tubing.

       Simple Analysis:

       The basic goal   of   the   experiment   is   to  demonstrate   that
       significantly more heat  emerges  from  the  cell under electrolysis
       than the joule heating of the cell.  This  is how the basic analysis
       works:

              The cell has a particular heating coefficient (HC), which can
        be determined  by employing (in the absence of electrolysis)  _pure
        resistance heating_  by  an  ordinary  precision  resistor  with an
        applied voltage. One might find,  for  example,  that  the  HC of a
        particular cell is say 25 C/watt.  This means that  for  a  watt of
        input power,  the  temperature  of  the liquid contents of the cell
        should rise 25 C above ambient. In this regard, keeping the ambient
        temperature stable is important; this is a source of possible error
        in the experiment.

              The heat input to the cell that would ordinarily be expected
        from electrolysis (the so-called  "joule  heating") is given by the
        expression:
                                    (V - 1.48)I

        where V is the voltage applied to the cell, and  I  is  the current
        passing though.  The  "I x 1.48" quantity here is the power lost by
        electrolytic production of oxygen and hydrogen. Because the cell is
        open to the atmosphere, this "power"  in  the  form  of potentially
        recoverable chemical energy simply escapes the cell.

              If, for example, the current is 80 mA and the applied voltage
        is 2.25 volts, the joule heat input to the cell would be 61.6 mW.

                                      Page 3





        [An example  used  by Professor Farrell]. If the HC were 25 C/watt,
        the expected _temperature rise_  of  the  cell  due  to the 61.6 mW
        input power would be 25 x 0.0616 = 1.54 C. If the temperature is
        observed to  rise  any  more than 1.54 C, an unknown  excess  power
        source may exist in the cell. If, for example, the temperature were
        observed to  rise  3.08  C,  rather  than  only  1.54C,  this would
        represent 100% more heat than 61.6 mW coming from the cell, that
        is, 133.2 mW.

              Excess powers on the order of 100 to 300%, calculated in this
        manner, are said to be readily achievable. As Professor Farrell has
        said, "We have never NOT gotten  the  effect."  [With these general
        conditions.]

        Caveat:

              This has been a tutorial for beginners by someone who has not
        done the experiment himself, but who has talked to  the  people who
        have. You  should be able to go off on your own now and find bigger
        and better ways to do this. You might  begin by trying pulsed power
        input, which supposedly increases the output. If  you  are  a  cold
        fusion skeptic, you should really relish this experiment! It offers
        an easily   reproducible  effect.  If  you  can  find  a  _trivial_
        explanation for the excess power, think how famous you'll be! More
        likely, you'll become a "Believer" -- or at least a very frustrated
        skeptic -- so watch out!
