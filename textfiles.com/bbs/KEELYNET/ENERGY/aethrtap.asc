  The Colorado Trip and some of what we learned

  At the 1994  ISNE  conference in Denver, we met some interesting people and
  collected some "anecdotal" stories that  you guys would like to know about.
  So here is  a  short synopsis of what appears to be a  way  to  tap  energy
  directly from the Aether.  The correlations are mine.

  There have been  experiments  involving  the  dropping  of  capacitors  and
  finding that a voltage appears across  the  terminals.   The  contention is
  that aether flows into the planetary neutral centre and in  its flow can be
  intercepted and "translated"  (like white light through a prism) into lower
  forces (magnetism, electricity, heat, mass, etc..see NEUTRAL1 on KeelyNet).

  A dielectric appears to intercept and  translate  this flow into electrical
  energy.  It could  also  simply  be the collection of electrostatic  energy
  from the air,  but  it's  no  fun  if  we  can't play with the more far-out
  aspects.  (spook it up a bit, eh?)

  Some suspect a piezoelectric effect from the shock of the capacitor against
  the floor and I don't know if those  capacitors  were  ever  dropped onto a
  soft surface.

  Norman Wootan says  he  has read where falling masses  seem  to  slow  down
  around 18" above  the  surface  of the earth.  Don Kelly's experiments with
  the gravity drop tests don't currently test this 18" hypothesis but it does
  seem to correlate and thus needs to be checked out.

  The reason I am bringing all this up is  because of a diagram shown to Norm
  and I by my old friend, Vic Hansen.  We were up very late one night and met
  Vic in the hall where we talked for a bit.  He showed us  a diagram of this
  very interesting idea  that  he  says  would  allow one to pull energy from
  either the earth or aether.

  It required the use of a one mile wire,  laid  out  in  a straight line.  I
  asked him if it could be wound up and he says he does  not  think  it  will
  work if NOT stretched out.

  So, you take  this  wire,  support it from the ground by non-conducting 18"
  high standoffs and stretch it over the one mile test area.

  On one end you put an AC power source,  with  the  ground wire connected to
  Earth ground, and the high side connected to the wire.

  On the opposite end, you tie in a string of lamps.  One  side  of the lamps
  are tied to  the  one  mile  hot  wire,  the other side is tied to an earth
  ground connection.

  Vic says you stay at the AC power source  side  of  the wire while watching
  the lamps with  a  pair of binoculars.  When you switch  in  the  AC  power
  source, the lights will all light up.

  Now comes the weird part.  If you very rapidly transfer the one mile wire

                                     Page 1





  connection FROM the AC source DIRECTLY to the earth ground, the LIGHTS WILL
  STAY ON!  Or so Vic tells us.

  I am told  there  is  a patent on this and seem to remember having seen one
  like it somewhere before.  It is interesting  to  note  that  Thomas  Henry
  Moray's Radiant Energy  Receiver  also  REQUIRED  the  use   of  long  wire
  antennas.  The 18"   height  is  a  curious  requirement  unless  there  is
  something really odd at this level above surface.

  While taking an elevator down to the  lobby,  we  ran into a fellow who was
  also building a type of free energy collection device.   He  says  he  will
  send us plans with further details but I'll tell you what he told us.

  You make a  box 30" wide by 15" tall by 15" wide.  Layer it with spun steel
  scour pads that are stretched out as  a  layer.   On  top of that layer you
  place a non-conductor,  he  said to use thin STYROFOAM sheets.   You  build
  multiple layers of this until the box is full.

  Two copper probes are then inserted into each side of the box, from the top
  down to the  center  and  running against the outside edges.  This fellows'
  diagram shows one probe coming in from  the upper left ending at the bottom
  center of the box.

  The other probe enters from the upper right and ends at  the  bottom center
  of the box.  Note that both probes stay up against the outside edges and do
  not touch.  I  think  that  allows  for the flow of energy across the steel
  mesh.

  A wet ground is then connected to the box probe on one side.

  The other probe is connected in series with a transformer (for removing the
  excess energy) that is again in series with a choke having 17 turns of wire
  and then passes into a dry earth ground.

  Our informant says this thing is supposed  to  produce around 5000 volts at
  10Amps.  So, if you choose to try this, be very careful.

  It appears to work as a giant capacitor or leyden jar.   I  have no idea if
  it works at  all  or  if so, how long it takes to "charge".  The use of the
  transformer is peculiar because it indicates  either a pulsing effect or AC
  itself.

  Well, you've got the descriptions as told to us, so get after it and let us
  know what you find.
