                      OVER UNITY ELECTRICAL GENERATOR DESIGN
                                        by
                                 Richard L. Clark

       The best form of an Over Unity Generator would have no moving parts.
       Looking at the  common  transformer  and  how it works, provides the
       answer.  If I take a DC power supply  and  connect it to the primary
       of the transformer, I can make a generator of sorts.  I'll turn "on"
       the DC to the primary for just an instant and then  turn  it  "off".
       In the secondary,  there  is  a  flux linkage, following the primary
       signal, which is  some  90% of the  input  power.   Any  transformer
       secondary will produce about 180% of the input power  in  this mode,
       with a gradually  applied  quarter  sine  or  sawtooth wave shape DC
       input.

       But wait, we are throwing recoverable power away in the primary coil
       winding's field collapse.  Now, let  us apply the DC power input and
       then, when the input power is cut off, switch the primary  winding's
       field collapse to  the  output  also.   The primary's field collapse
       contributes at least another 90% to  the output for a grand total of
       about 270% gain in the over unity generator design.

       The DC power signal, must only take the primary winding  up and then
       let go (open) at the top voltage.  Thus, the primary can be switched
       to the output to recover it's field collapse.

       Electronic switching can accomplish all of these functions at little
       power usage and  cost.   There, the gain of a transformer Over Unity
       Generator, would probably be around  the  250% output power to input
       power, and there is no mechanical motion.

       Some old motors and generators could be adapted to  the  transformer
       design above.  The  armature  must  be fixed permanently stationary,
       and the air gap between the armature  and  field  coils, filled with
       iron filings.  The air gap iron filings or iron power filling, is to
       make the best use of the primary's (armature) full flux power.  This
       makes for the  best  transformer action and the highest  power  gain
       possible with this  conversion  design.   The  electronic  switching
       circuitry, is the same as the common  transformer  design.   All  we
       have done is convert the motor to a transformer.

       In this design, for one "up" (power signal) in the primary coil, we

                                      Page 1





       get the "up"  (field  build)  in  the secondary coil and the "downs"
       (field collapses) of both the secondary  and primary coils as output
       power.

       Think of the transformer coils as coupled "springs",  and  it may be
       clearer.  This transformer/generator  design  has been in the nature
       of electromagnetic coils all the time.   If  the unit is actuated 60
       times a second, allowing for the counter-electromotive  force  filed
       collapses, it makes  a  standard  60Hz  electrical  generator.  This
       design concept, is  the natural last  step  after  recovery  of  the
       secondary collapses, introduced in generator designs.

       The same principal and results could then be achieved in a capacitor
       system.  The charge (up) cycle from the secondary plate  and the two
       discharge cycles from  both  secondary  and primary plates, would be
       the output power.   The  basic  external  switching  electronics  is
       basically the same as in the transformer designs.

       These designs  are  in  the  basic nature of energy storage/transfer
       elements....one input allows  for  the  utility  of  the  one  input
       transfer and the two storage collapses or discharges as output power
       (about 300% gain).
