              A New Form of Thermoelectric Energy Conversion
              ==============================================

1.) Abstract
------------
Thermocouples can  be used to convert heat in electrical energy. The principle
is  quite easy:

      A circuit of two different metals and a temperature difference is enough
      for this purpose, but unfortunately the efficiency of conversion is
      quite low.

I want to introduce  a new idea with an additional capacitor. This method may
clear up some disadvantages of thermocouples and hopefully increases its
efficiency.  But most importantly, this method may work without a global
temperature difference.

2.) Introduction
----------------
Figure 1 shows the basic arrangement for a thermocouple. Two wires of dis-
similar metals (A and B) are connected at their ends and the junctions are
being held at different temperatures (T1 and T2). Under these conditions an
electric potential exists and therefore this circuit generates electrical
power. This effect is called Seebeck effect.

The left junction is absorbing heat and converting it to electrical energy,
which cools this junction. At the other end, some of the generated electrical
energy is converted to heat and so heating the right junction.

It is important to note that different temperatures are a basic requirement.
Otherwise, electricity can not be generated, regardless of the combination of
the wires.  Figure 2 shows an example, which surely generates no electricity.

       Figure 1: Seebeck effect                 Figure 2: No electricity

Figure 3 shows that if two metals are brought into contact, electrons will
flow from the one metal to the other until the Fermi levels are at equal
height. This potential difference is known as the contact or Volta potential
difference.

This happens even WITHOUT a temperature difference and a Cu-Li contact
generates remarkable 2 Volt! But it is obvious that this potential difference
can not be measured with a normal voltmeter because this would lead to a
similar circuit as shown in figure 2.

However the contact potential difference can be measured by "static
voltmeters", because they do not need a direct contact to the metals.

Another potential difference is the Galvani potential difference.  Let the
metals have energy differences EA and EB between the Fermi level and the
bottom of the conduction band, respectively. The difference in potential
energy EA-EB can be described by the Galvani potential difference.

If EA<EB, then an amount of work EB-EA must be done to bring an electron from
metal A to metal B. Therefore this electron loses this amount of kinetic
energy which cools the junction.

       metal A

            Figure 3: Volta potential difference

Figure 3 shows an example. Two electric neutral metals are connected at one
end.  Assume that work function of metal A is lower than of metal B.  Due to
the different Fermi level some electrons must flow from metal A to B through
the junction and this cools it a little bit down, since EA<EB.

So for a short time heat energy is transformed in electric energy. Note that
this occurs without a global temperature difference and only one time after
connecting.

3.) Idea
--------
We can connect a special capacitor at the free ends of this circuit (Fig.4).
The upper plate is made of metal B whereas the lower plate is of metal A.  In
addition to this there is a small switch inside to generate a short-circuit.

    ##########################

    Figure 5: Second stable state (after some e- flow to plate A)

The operation can be divided in two parts:

  a)  The switch inside the capacitor is open. So the contact potential
      difference pumps electrons into the capacitor until it is loaded.
      Figure 4 shows this first stable state. Any other distribution of the
      electrons, for example a discharged capacitor, will again loaded up due
      to the contact potential and the system will come again to the first
      stable state.

      This occurs without electrical energy from somewhere outside.  But when
      electrons flow from metal A to B, the left junction slightly cools down
      so it is obviously that heath energy is converted into electric energy.
      Inside the  capacitor an electric field arises from plate A to plate B
      due to the positions of the electrons.

  b)  Figure 5 shows what happens when the switch inside the capacitor
      produces a short-circuit: Some electrons flow against the contact
      potential from plate B to plate A. On the left junction there occurs the
      full contact potential, but on the other junction inside the capacitor
      there is the contact potential but decreased from the electric field. So
      in sum the potential in the right contact is smaller and therefore some
      electrons flow to plate A.

Unfortunately this lasts only a short time because the electric field is
getting smaller the more electrons flow from plate B to A.

So after a while a new state will turn up. Figure 5 shows this second stable
state with the closed switch.

How can we use this?  We have only to open and close periodically the switch
inside the capacitor and each time a small electric impulse will be generated.
It is important to note that through this method heat energy will transformed
in electricity, so the left junction will be cooled.

A normal thermocouple (figure 1) generates a different contact potential
through different temperature at the junctions. This new method uses a
capacitor.  If it is loaded and we produce a short-circuit, this junction also
has a different contact potential due to the additional electric field.  So in
this moment, it occurs the same situation as the right junction would have a
slightly higher temperature.

The switch does not need energy himself, if we use a sort of electronic fuse.
These elements get conductive, if an electric field exceeds a certain bound.
In this case, the switch can automatically switch to the two stable states
and each time transfers a little bit heat into electrical energy.

4.) Theoretical aspects
-----------------------
Some people meant that this idea can not be utilized in an economic way,
because the effects are too small. This may be right, but first of all it
is important to clarify if this idea is (from a theoretical view) correct
or not.

"Doesn't this idea contradict the first law of thermodynamics?"

No, but I want to point out that this is a novel idea. Normally thermoelectric
circuits convert a difference of temperature into electric power, but with
this method it might be possible to transform (simply) heat into electricity,
however the energy is conserved in this closed system.

"And what about the second law of thermodynamics?"

This statement says that "heat will not flow spontaneously from a cold object
to a hot object".

But with this method, the heat does not flow without any reason. On the
contrary the electrical potential difference of the metals is the cause.

5.) Thought experiment
----------------------
I want to present a short "thought experiment" to point out the different
behaviour of electrons and gases.

It is easy to produce coldness: we have only to expand compressed gas in a
greater box. This step corresponds to figure 4, because the electrons also
"expand" and generate a little bit coldness at the contact of the two metals.

But after a while the gas pressure and the temperature stabilize and it is
only possible to throw off the balance with energy from outside the system.

Electrons behave in the same manner, except one important detail. They have an
additional electric charge, which can be utilized to load a capacitor. Only
this charge is sufficient to put off balance because more electrons flow in
one metal than without the capacitor. But it is important to note that this
happens without power.

If you short-circuit the capacitor you can unbalance this distribution of the
electrons and so some electrons will flow. Then you cut the connection and
again some electrons will flow.

But how would normal gas act, if it had the same behaviour?  Suppose, inside
the box is a wall then a very surprising thing would happen:

     On the one side of this wall the gas would be compressed and on the other
     the gas would be expand, and this occurred without energy from outside.
     This is, of course, impossible for normal gas, but I tried to show that
     electrons act like this. Maybe it is possible to use this effect, I hope
     so ...

That`s a good point. In fact, the entropy would decrease and I have discussed
this matter with some people. I would say, that the 2nd law of thermodynamics
in its "pure" form doesn't touch the entropy at all.

This law is surprising general:

        "Heat will not flow spontaneously from a cold to a hot object."

No one will question this, and my idea does not contradict this either.  But
indeed there are some conclusions (are they really correct?), which are more
specific and they contradict my idea.

The switch is the main problem of this idea. But first I only want to focus
on the theoretical view. A perfect pn-switch has an unlimited resistance, and
in this case the capacitor will be loaded up.  A real pn-switch has a little
leak, but maybe it isn`t enough to change the principle.

Anyway I want to split up this idea into three parts:

  1)  Does the capacitor really load up only due to the Volta potential and
      without a temperature difference?
  2)  It is (theoretically) possible to produce a switch, which automatically
      short-circuits the capacitor having a certain electric field inside?
      (This is the idea Bearden expressed in his 'Final Secret to Free Energy'
      in 1994....KeelyNet/Jerry)
  3)  Is it possible, that after short-circuiting the capacitor, some
      electrons flow against the Volta potential, but together with the
      electric field?

I would answer all three questions with "rather yes", so you see I'm not
really convinced. But on the other hand, if I am wrong, at least one of these
questions must be answered with "no", but until now, I haven't found someone,
who said "no, because.."

Sometimes I hope that one would do this, because I have many many other things
to do, but nevertheless I am happy about any answer I get.
                                                                      Gerhard
