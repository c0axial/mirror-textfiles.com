The following is an interesting and informative letter uploaded by Lee
Trippett.  Lee is an engineer who is very active in the areas of free energy
and associated phenomena.  He is the man responsible for the TOD circuit which
showed how a digital multimeter can provide readings which are erroneous when
applied to unusual circuits which appear to be over-unity.

We all learned from this and it is to Lee's credit that he would not rest
until he proved (in this case DISPROVED) the validity OF HIS OWN CIRCUIT which
generated seeming over-unity results.

This is the kind of open-mindedness, honesty and integrity which we should all
do our best to promote and maintain in all alternative research areas.  The
opinions of academia and vested science will become even more irrelevant when
circumvented by the knowledge of ONE working circuit that can be duplicated.

Hello Jerry!

The following paragraphs which are within quotation marks are taken directly
from a letter I recently sent to Hal Fox.  Last night I downloaded some of
your KeelyNet files and found references to some work that I have done and
which relates to the following topics.

 "A group in Seattle visited Yul Brown in California a few years ago.  They
  published notes and a mathematical argument to the effect that the Brown's
  gas generator could demonstrate excess energy by igniting the gas in a
  sealed chamber.  This was to allow the gas to recombine to form water.

  The resulting vacuum was, in theory, found to be near perfect and the
  resulting mechanical energy was expected to exceed the original electrical
  energy needed to break down the water into its component parts.

  (By the way, there are several references to this in the literature, but
  none of the references point out the fact that there is first a very violent
  explosion.)

  By applying a vacuum to the residual piping, pressure/vacuum gauges,
  cylinder chambers and then injecting a small pressure of Brown's gas
  generated by his model BN 200 into an industrial quality air cylinder, the
  formation of water was observed but no vacuum exceeding the original.  The
  constraints placed on the piston did not reveal any energy in excess of the
  electrical energy used to generate the gas needed for the experiment."

Some further comments for KeelyNet readers.  I had to be extremely cautious
with this experimenting because of the potential hazards of hydrogen and
oxygen gases.  Many thanks to Gary Hawkins of Seattle for his words of caution
and willingness to share his experience.  There are many details of this
project which need additional explanation.  But I will limit myself to one
major point.

To prevent spontaneous combustion the generation of Brown's gas must be done
with very special electrodes and chamber configuration to prevent the ratio of
hydrogen and oxygen from deviating more than 5% of the natural 2 to 1 ratio.

Another point.  The Brown's gas flame shows a yellow fringe.  This tells me
the gas contains some of the sodium from the electrolyte.  This also might
mean the gas components are not true monoatomic.  And still one more point of
importance.  A flame arrestor must always be used in the gas circuit.  I
discovered this the hard way as one was not supplied internally as indicated
in the instruction booklet.

 "Puharich's patent 4,394,230 outlines a method and apparatus of splitting
  water molecules at exceptional efficiencies. Printed comments by respected
  people in the field indicate there is a resonance frequency in which water
  would break down into its component gases with a resulting energy efficiency
  above 100%.

  I created a hydrolysis device in which one could measure the rate of gas
  generation by means of a precision air flow rate meter.  The required sharp
  pulsed direct current waveform was applied to carbon electrodes over the
  full range of frequencies found in the patent and other related literature.
  Not the slightest variation was found in the rate of gas generation over a
  wide range of frequencies."

Some further comments for KeelyNet readers.  When I suspended a drop of water
between two gold electrodes and sufficient power is applied the water will
both turn to steam and hydrogen and oxygen gas.  Puharich's patent uses a
special hardware configuration which could inject into a cylinder the results
of both steam and the two gases of water.  I am wondering if the special
combination of the gases along with the steam might be the reason for his
extraordinary energy results.(?)

 "The MRA or magnetic resonance amplifier is basically a tuned circuit using
  very special non-linear passive components.  The reactive passive components
  cannot work alone.  They need an input alternating signal to function and so
  the computation of energy ratio must include the energy required for the
  required signal source!  This point has been consistently overlooked.

  Therefore; I assembled a very simple and small signal generator with some
  limited capacity for variable frequency energized by a single small battery.
  Also, in this way, the confusion of measuring power factor or current &
  voltage phase relations for a high Q circuit are omitted.  The dc power gain
  was found to be far less than 100%."

To add some emphasis.  It is impossible for the two electrical reactive
passive components to work alone or together without a signal.  The energy
which generates the signal source must be included in the equation for
calculating power conversion or gain.

On still another subject of energy.  Many years ago I developed, after two
years of trial and error, two ways to inject and monitor the rate of gasoline
consumption for an 11 hp engine which was driving an electric generator.

I monitored this flow for a constant resistive electrical load of 2500 watts.
The difference in flow rate using the regular carburetor and my device for
vaporizing the fuel was 300%.  That is right, three hundred percent
improvement in fuel efficiency!  (The fuel was vaporized by injecting it into
a jacket surrounding the exhaust pipe which was filled with steel beads.
Additional details available upon request.)

After making this startling re-discovery of a common old idea I talked to a
number of community college instructors in the automotive field. They were not
at all surprised but when they told me of the political and economic
ramifications of getting this information adopted I dropped the whole project.
