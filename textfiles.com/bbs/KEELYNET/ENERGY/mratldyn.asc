Introduction

One (1) MRA S/N 95-3 was setup for demonstration and measurement verification
on 25 September 1995.  The demonstration and measurements were performed at
the Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical (TRA) Engineering Environmental Laboratory
located in San Diego, California.

The demonstration was conducted by Robert Taylor and the measurement
verification was performed by Ed Everett of Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical.  The
MRA demonstration and measurement verification was conducted according to
customer direction.  No written plan/guideline was provided.  A chronological
record of the event was maintained and is identified as TR 3715.  The test log
was used as the basis of this report and a copy of this log is presented as
Attachment A.  A copy of the equipment list is also included as Attachment B.
A short discussion of the measurements made is provided below.

Discussion

The customer setup the MRA as shown in Figure 1.  Using his own signal
generator, power amplifier and measurement meter, the customer demonstrated
the MRA to his visitors.  After his demonstration and discussion, the MRA
circuit was connected to a TRA RF signal generator, (Rohde & Schwarz model
845.4002.44), as shown in Figure 2.  The following conditions/assumptions
apply:
       a)  The MRA was treated as a Black Box with an input (A & B) and an
           output (D & E).
       b)  The input circuit was considered a series circuit i.e. the current
           flow R1 & R2 represents the total input current.
       c)  No examination of the MRA was made other than a cursory visual
           inspection of the exterior.

Using a TRA oscilloscope, (Tektronix model 2205), the following measurements
were made:

  1)  The signal generator was set to 91.412 Khz per the customer, and the
      output was turned up to the maximum level.
  2)  The input to the MRA (points A to B) was measured and found to be 0.085
      Volts peak (Vpk), or 0.060 Volts RMS, (Vrms).
  3)  The voltage across R1 & R2 (B to C) was measured next and found to be
      0.125 Vpk (0.088 Vrms).
  4)  The input current was then calculated per the customer as the voltage
      (rms) across R1 & R2 divided by the resistance of R1 + R2.  This yields
      0.3 uAmps.
  5)  The output voltage across R3 (D & E) was measured and found to be 0.015
      Vpk (0.0106 Vrms).
  6)  The output current through R3 was calculated per the customer as the
      voltage (rms) across R3 divided by the resistance of R3.  This yields
      10.6 uAmps.
  7)  The customer defines the MRA gain as the output voltage (rms) D to E
      times the output current through R3 divided by the input voltage (rms) A
      to B times the input current through R1 & R2.

            This yields (0.0106 X 10.6 X 10 to the minus 6th) = 6.2

  8)  The customer removed the input to the MRA at points A & B.  The output
      across R3 was measured again and was found to be approximately 1 to 2
      millivolts of noise.

The frequency of all voltages measured was 91.412 Khz except for step 8 which
was random noise.
