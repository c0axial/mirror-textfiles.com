The following file deals with some anomalies associated with circularly
polarized Electromagnetic waves.

Ernest Cullwick was one of the first people, back in 1957, to notice that
there is an unusual problem in trying analyze a rotating EM wave. There hasn't
been much formal work done on this subject since Cullwick's book (at least not
that we know about).

But, it's evident from the the discussion in this forum over the last few
days, that the mysterious properties of the circulating EM wave have not gone
completely un-noticed. Here's a few more things about it.

If you work out the metric for EM waves circulating in a cavity you get some
strange results. There is a preliminary discussion of this effect in the
article by Houshang Ardavan, 'Gravitational Waves from Electromagnetic Waves'
in the book "Classical General Relativity," edited by W.B. Bonner, I.N. Islam
and M.A.H. MacCollum (Cambridge Univ. Press, 1984).

It is something I have seen done. At the point in an annular cavity where the
phase velocity goes from less than c to greater than c, a term shows up in the
derived metric of the system that looks like a source term.

On the other hand you have assumed that the metric is source free in the EM
region of the cavity.  So you get a solution which contradicts the hypothesis
that went into building the solution. You get something which is possibly
unphysical.

Now Einstein's equation and the associated geometry is pretty tricky and it is
easy to get unphysical solutions.  The final arbiters of whether a solution is
satisfactory or not is physical reasonability and self consistancy (these are
almost the same thing).

The cavity problem seems very physically reasonable initially, but ends with a
self-consistancy problem which appears to be unphysical.  Also, Cauchy's
theorem does not apply to this case since it becomes a mixed type problem
(elliptic and hyperbolic PDEs), so the Hawking singularity theorems don't a
priori apply.

It is something very interesting, but to publish it with out being scoffed at
would take a lot of work and possibly inventing some new math.

Next some comments by Dr Dennis Cravens in a report titled

                         "Electric Propulsion Study",
       done for the Astronautics Laboratory at Edwards AFB. August 1990.

Dennis Cravens was formerly with SAIC Corp, and is now working with CETI in
development of cold fusion. Anyway, here's some things he says in the electric
propulsion report about the "peculiarities" of a rotating magnet:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ROTATION OF MAGNETS - There is a continuing debate in physics as to the
reality of the magnetic field. The prime question is whether the axial
magnetic field of a bar magnet rotates with the magnet or is stationary.

The Faraday homopolar generator dates back to the 1830s.  DePalma, Tewari, and
others have attempted to utilize the Faraday generator to produce more power
than needed to run it. Most objective reviews of the work have, however,
failed to see such effects.

It is doubtful that these claims will be independently validated and even more
doubtful that they will lead directly to a propulsive system.  However, the
work on homopolar generators as high current devices is reasonable and may be
useful for ground uses. The angular momentum complications seem to rule the
system out for any practical space applications.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEARL EFFECT - The Searl Effect is a separate issue from homopolar generator
above. Searl has claimed to produce disk levitation by rapidly rotating
magnets. There have been claims of anti-gravity, high electric fields,
perpetual motion, inertial loss, and gas ionization. All these claims come
from Searl or those supportive of his work and no outside witnesses are
available. Searl has not supplied any technical data or specifics of the
operation in any easily referenced source. It is not recommended that his work
be experimentally followed by the USAF. It is worth noting however, that a
rotating magnet does have some definite theorectical peculiarities.

Through the years there have been many interesting developments concerning the
Faraday Homopolar generator. DePalma has claimed to get more energy out than
is supplied to the the generator.  None of the claims seem to withstand
careful examination and no machine has ever been made self driving. The
underlying reason that such claims continue to surface is that rotating
magnetic fields are extremely difficult to handle within existing theories.

This is because for a rotating frame there is a distance (removed from the
axis) which is travelling at velocities greater than c. Although the distance
is not withing any real physical object, it's existence within the
mathematical development greatly complicates any calculations.
