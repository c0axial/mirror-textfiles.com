       A greeting to the KeelyNetters from the TVQ group :

       We are delighted  with the response to REPLY.TXT, and we feel we owe
       a debt to  the KeelyNetters for our  occasional  "stalking"  in  the
       past.  It is time to pay up and put up.

       Who are we, what are we doing here?

       Our group exists only as a set of overlapping personal relationships
       between individuals.  There are no rules as such, no membership list
       or requirements, just  common  goals and dedication  to  a  rational
       approach.  Not pseudoscience.   We  cooperate on the basis of mutual
       respect for the dedication needed  to  pursue  any "fringe" area and
       maintain the standards  of  good  science.   We  have  had  projects
       funded, and make no restrictions on members obtaining outside fund-
       ing, or using their new skills for hire.

       Most of our  members  are  professionals  in  technical and business
       positions, and therefore wish to  remain  discreetly  anonymous,  so
       that we can  afford  to pursue our common interests.   This  is  the
       cause of much of the "stalking".

       As a group, we were fortunate to have been in the right place at the
       right time.  Our  inception  was  in  the greater Boston area, which
       provided us with an abundance of surplus equipment as well as access
       to some cutting edge technologies  and  a vast array of professional
       skills.  We now  make these resources available to  new  members  in
       other areas.  Access  to  Internet,  the  Tesla BBS and now KeelyNet
       have allowed us  to  find  new  members  and  make  our  skills  and
       experience available to others.

       We possess equipment ranging from aircraft to xenon  gas  (I suppose
       we've got some  zinc  somewhere),  and  several  well  stocked  labs
       located in industrial space as well as in individuals homes.  We are
       comparatively understaffed, and the equipment largely underutilized.
       For this reason, as well as good karma,  we  are reaching out to get
       things moving.

       We welcome new members, and our book is intended to  be a recruiting
       tool as well  as  a  catalyst.   If  the  initial  reaction  of  the
       KeelyNeters is any indication, we are sure we will succeed.

       When will it be published?

       The length of  time  is  probably inversely related to the amount of
       grief we receive, if we found ourselves  surrounded  by an angry mob
       armed with pitchforks  and  torches we would get right  on  it.   If
       anyone has any  devices  or  results that should be included, let us
       know now.

       Here is the tentative outline for the book.

       Chapter 1 - Introduction, a short  and  hopefully painless monologue
                   stating the party line.

       Chapter 2 - Detector design theory, how they work, how to design new
                   ones.

       Chapter 3 - Practical detectors, construction projects  for  several
                   scalar detectors  and  spectrum  analyzers,  including a
                   bidirectional scalar transceiver.

       Chapter 4 - Translator design theory,  what works, what doesn't, and
                   why.

       Chapter 5 - Practical translators, construction projects for several
                   scalar translators.

       Chapter 6 - Scalar systems theory, open vs. closed systems, balanced
                   systems, etc.

       Chapter 7 - Construction tips and test equipment.

       Chapter 8 - Test data and data logging, will include  test  data  on
                   all devices presented.

       Chapter 9 - Definition of terms.

       Chapter 10 - References and recommended reading lists.

       We understand that  by  discussing  the  virtual  particle  collider
       design on KeelyNet, the loud mouthed  "chief designer" will probably
       have to include a chapter on power generation systems  theory.  This
       will be another delay.

       Some thoughts from "The Chief Designer".

       I must apologize  to  my  readers  for  the  use  of  terms  such as
       "Translation Matrix" in the REPLY.TXT file uploaded to KeelyNet.
       I believe that it is the responsibility of the speaker to be clearly
       understood.  I will attempt to eliminate any confusion that has been
       caused here, before the publication  of Practical Scalar Engineering
       Vol. 1.

       The term Translation Matrix is a generic term which   refers  to the
       matter or spacetime  in  which the translation from virtual particle
       flux to photon flux occurs.  This  is  the translation from "current
       free potential" to "free energy".  This process (Exophoton  emission
       as an example)  may  be  performed  in  free  space  (vacuum) by the
       process of field  interference.   More  commonly,  it  is  performed
       within matter.  In Mr. Bearden's example this is done within the

                                      Page 2





       degenerate semiconductor material.   The  design we presented uses a
       series of gas filled tubes prepared  in  the manner described in our
       letter to Mr. Bearden.

       So in summary,  the translation matrix is the area  or  material  in
       which the translation process is performed.

       For further clarification,  in  the system we describe in our paper,
       it all goes  like this : A source  of  charge,  we  care  not  what,
       charges the virtual  particle  flux  collector.  This  provides  Mr.
       Bearden's "Current free  potential",  which  is  switched  onto  the
       translation matrix and exciting the  atoms.   The  switch now opens,
       the electrons all fall down and radiate electromagnetic radiation.
       This is delivered  to the load, bills go away, bill  collectors  get
       mad.

       The confusion caused  by  such  a generic term is exactly what I had
       wished to avoid, and the reason the  I  resorted  to  describing the
       details of a practical system.  I will endeavor to avoid this in the
       future.  I would like to thank Mark Mansfield for calling me on this
       one.

       In an electrostatically balanced configuration, the energy system we
       have described is actually a Virtual Particle-Antiparticle Collider,
       so don't try this at home unless you are very sure  you know exactly
       what you are doing.  Gamma rays are nasty.

       Unbalanced configuration should  not  be  run in excess of 100 watts
       delivered power, and even then only for short duration demonstration
       or testing use.

       Avoid the area  during  and  shortly  after  the  operation  of  any
       unbalanced system.  If you can possibly avoid it,  don't  do  it  at
       all.  Note that  if  a  resistive  load  is  run  by this unbalanced
       device, it will still run hot, because  we  have  done a good job of
       translation.  At low power levels any time reversed  effects are too
       small to measure.  Most of the existing "free energy" designs can be
       redesigned for correct operation in this way.

       If the "time  reversed"  effect  is what you need, don't do it in an
       open system.

       An energy generation system such as we have discussed so far is open
       to the quantum vacuum.  It would  be  foolish  to  attempt  anything
       other than getting  the  energy  we  need  in an open  system.   The
       construction of closed  versus open systems will be explained in the
       book.

       Jerry Decker has asked if our group  has  an  official definition of
       terms.  Indeed we  do,  and  it  will be included  in  volume  1  of
       Practical Scalar Engineering.   I  am  including  a  sample of those
       definitions which relate to the system  described  in  our letter to
       Mr. Bearden.

       In fact we  have a hypertext information tree system  running  on  a
       network of engineering  workstations  which  contains  most  of  our
       designs, lab notes, theoretical papers  etc.  These workstations are
       located in various locations throughout one of our  installations so
       that each work center or bench has access to the database.  These

                                      Page 3





       workstations (made by  Apollo Computer) run an unfortunately obscure
       windowing, multitasking, and networking  operating  system  (Aegis).
       This makes exporting data to the DOS or Mac worlds time consuming.
       This work is  already underway, as Practical Scalar  Engineering  is
       comprised of excerpts  from  that  database,  and  must  be my first
       priority.

       These workstations are available surplus  for the price of a PC, and
       feature an ISA  bus for experiment automation and  data  collection.
       They are based  on  the  68020 and 68030 processors for you computer
       types.  If any  new  members  are interested,  the  Aegis  Hypertext
       version of the  database  could  be made available  in  the  future,
       complete with the workstation, of course.

       It has been  brought  to my attention that the article on the "Cyber
       Probe" has been  uploaded  onto  KeelyNet.   Although  some  of  the
       applications of the  device  presented  may  have   no  place  in  a
       technical discussion, its   operating  principals  may.   The  basic
       design of the device can be improved to produce a device which
       responds only to the scalar electrostatic potential gradients.  Such
       a device has been constructed, and  includes a reference meter which
       indicates the vector  energy  density as well as the  magnitude  and
       polarity of the electrostatic gradient.

       We would like to have our device compared to the original devices by
       persons already familiar with such devices.  Perhaps in the hands of
       an "adept" individual with a bit of "cross training" this device and
       others like it  can  add  credibility  to  the  investigation of all
       manner of phenomena.  Any KeelyNeters  out there on ParaNet?  I just
       design and build 'em, this other stuff is someone else's job.

       Definitions of some terms used in the original TVQ paper :

         Scalar Electromagnetics.
           Scalar electromagnetics  is an as yet incomplete  unified  field
           theory which   studies   the   behavior   of   vector  sum  zero
           electromagnetic systems.

         Natural Scalar Potentials.
           Scalar potentials  which  have   a   non-deterministic  (random)
           substructure.  For  example,  white  noise.   Artificial  Scalar
           potentials have deterministic substructures.  The quantum vacuum
           is a natural scalar potential.

         Quantum vacuum.
           The concept  of  the quantum vacuum is taken from modern quantum
           mechanics theory, and is what we scalar researchers use to scare
           the hell out of "classical" physicists.   Good definitions exist
           in textbooks.

         Potential.
           Stress on  spacetime.  The  intensity  of  the   natural  scalar
           potential of  the quantum vacuum, or any ordering of the virtual
           particle flux of the quantum vacuum.   Order in and of itself it
           not implied, as in a natural scalar potential.

         Exophoton emission.
           Exophoton emission  is  the  process  by  which   a  photon  (or
           electron) is  liberated  from  the  Dirac  sea.  This process is
           taken from  standard quantum  mechanics,  and  is  described  in
           textbooks.





         Exoelectron emission.
           See exophoton emission.

         Translator.
           Translators are  scalar  electromagnetic components which either
           take electromagnetic waves and  phase  cancel them (sum to zero)
           producing scalar  waves,  or conversely transform  scalar  waves
           into electromagnetic waves, or both.

         Translation matrix.
           The translation  matrix  is that part of a translating system in
           which the translation process  occurs.   It  may  be  the  space
           surrounding a coil, or between the plates of a  capacitor, or it
           may be the matter comprising the translator itself.

         Translation Process.
           The translation process is the mechanism by which a potential is
           converted from   scalar   to  vector  (electromagnetic)  or  the
           reverse.  We  currently  have  documented  the  following  eight
           translation processes, but there is debate as to  whether or not
           they are unique :

           1)   Translation  by  sum  zero  high  ration  transformation  -
                Tesla's favorite.
           2)   Translation by radiated  wave  interference.  - Scalar beam
                generation.
           3)   Translation by standing wave interference.  -  Scalar field
                generation.
           4)   Translation  by  net  non-inductors.  -  No  E  or B fields
                present.
           5)   Translation by plasma / Lamb shift. - Exophoton emission as
                in our example.
           6)   Translation   by   non-linear    junctions    -   Such   as
                semiconductors.
           7)   Translation by magnetic modulation - As in  the Dea-Faretto
                detector.
           8)   Translation   by   inert  gases.  -  This  one  takes  some
                explaining, but  is  has  to  do  with  the  generation  of
                powerful natural scalar potentials.

       Each of these processes will be described in detail in the book, and
       practical examples will be given.

         Virtual Particle.
           Virtual particles are the "messengers" of quantum  physics,  and
           are responsible  for all fields.  Virtual particles are standard
           quantum physics, and are described  in textbooks on the subject.
           Virtual particles  are  identical to normal particles,  but  are
           temporally unstable.

         Virtual Particle flux.
           See quantum vacuum.

         Virtual Particle Flux Collector.
           The virtual  particle  flux  collector  is a component of scalar
           electro-magnetic systems which  converts an electrostatic charge
           into pure virtual particle flux.

       I hope this clears up any confusion I have created.  Now a few words
       from some of our other members.

       Thoughts from "HAL":

       As the instigator,  of sorts, of the TVQ group, I primarily function
       in the corporate environment, creating  corporations  and  the like,
       and putting people and ideas together to see where  it will lead.  I
       have always had   an   avid   passion  for  research  into  lost  or
       alternative technologies.  My goal  is  getting  to  the  truth  and
       presenting these concepts  to  the  people  who  can   put  them  to
       practical use, and making things happen.

       In approximately 1985  I  presented several papers to some engineers
       for evaluation.  They were skeptical, but willing to "look it over".
       Their skepticism waned rapidly as  devices  were constructed, tested
       and effects proven to exist that needed further study.

       Our "Chief Designer" was a particularly rewarding challenge  because
       he was skeptical for a very long time.  It has become evident to the
       TVQ Group that the time has come to share our many years of research
       in the hope  of  unifying  all  of  our  efforts.  If we are ever to
       realize freedom we will have to  get  this  information  out  to and
       understood by the  mainstream  not the fringe minority.   We  should
       compile a master  database of all experimental results, available to
       all researchers.  At  the present  time  we  have  enough  computing
       capability that we can serve as a master electronic library.

       Some thoughts from our "Tesla Technologist":

       The skills that  I  bring to the TVQ group are somewhat  diverse  in
       nature.  Here are  a few of my "Hobbies":  Programming, electronics,
       chemistry, physics, ancient civilizations,  music and the occult.  I
       am therefore best  described  as  the "Jack of all  Trades"  of  TVQ
       group.

       My primary interests  are  in  generating  extreme amounts of energy
       (both continuous and  pulsed)  for   such   applications  as  potent
       directed energy beams,  high-density  energy  fields   (for  use  as
       shields), gravitational control  and modification, teleportation and
       time engineering.  I have been pursuing  this technology since 1978.
       My first contact with TVQ group came in 1989 on the  Tesla BBS (Toby
       Grotz) in Colorado.   I was working with non-vector EM energy pulses
       and needed a  reliable  set  of  detectors  for  field  mapping  and
       intensity measuring.  Since  my  initial contact with  TVQ,  I  have
       constructed four different detector types (three TVQ designs and one
       of my own  inventions  based  on opto-isolator integrated circuits.)
       All four devices were quite successful.

       Since then, I have worked with others  at  TVQ  on some of Bearden's
       concepts and on the Virtual Particle/Anti-Particle  Collider system.
       It is my  sincere  hope  that the book that we are preparing and the
       devices that are being designed will usher in a new era of technolgy
       for mankind.  I  firmly  believe   that  the  proper  use  of  these
       engineering principles will  provide  the  means to  accomplish  the
       lofty goals that I have outlined above.

       I believe that other researchers working in these areas need to come
       forward now and lay their cards down on the table with us.  This

       technology is too  important  to let it "fade away" as it has tended
       to do in the past (along with its' researchers.)

                                             All the best wishes,

                                             TVQ Group
