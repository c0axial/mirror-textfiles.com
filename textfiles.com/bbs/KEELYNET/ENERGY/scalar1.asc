                                   3D TIME & SPACE:

            For simplicity and concept of understanding I will be describing
       what we have come to know as the real world or what we perceive as
       being a three dimensional time and space on a linear plane.

            The three  dimensions being length, height and width. It really is
       a four diminsional space of which  time  being  a  man  made factor for
       reference is the fourth dimension.

            In reality space time is curved. If we zero in close enough we can
       talk about it as if it were linear if for nothing other than simplicity
       and understanding. If I were to try and talk about time and space as it
       really is then  it  would become complex dealing with  arcs,  spherical
       dimensions and higher  mathemathics  as  kerr  metrics. For now we will
       consider our dimension as a three dimensional time cube.

                                     HYPERSPACE:

            In Fig.  1  we  have  our 3D Space/Time  Cube.  Our  X  axis  will
       represent the axis of acceleration. The Z axis is our  matter or object
       axis.

            As our  object  target  we will use a rectangular box having known
       length, height and width. [See Fig.5]   It  is  not important to assign
       values to these  figures  as  of  yet.  The pictorial  concept  is  the
       important value of what I have to say about time and space.

            We will  let  the  Y  axis  represent Lambda or Light. It is light
       itself and not necessarily the speed  of  light.  This  would mean that
       light is 90 degrees in our 3D Space/Time Cube to matter.  If we shifted
       reference points by rotation this would make our Z axis or matter axis

                                        Page 1





       now light and  our  Y axis which was our Light axis now matter. This is
       important for this is where Planks constant comes in. This makes Planks
       constant as important in our 3D Space/Time  Cube  as the speed of light
       is in the formula E=MC squared, E being energy, M the  mass  and  C the
       speed of light.

            You should  now  have a clear picture or viewpoint in your mind of
       the 3 dimensional rectangular box resting in our 3D Space/Time Cube in
       reference to our linear X,Y and X axis or perceivable world.

            The fourth dimension being acceleration or the change in time one,
       delta one start reference point and  time  two  or  delta  two the last
       reference point which will also give us the distance travelled  between
       delta one and  delta  two. Now in Fig.5 look at the leading edge of our
       box which is parallel with the Y axis or light axis Lambda.

            Now this leading edge is our reference point when we start talking
       about delta one to delta two or acceleration to the speed of light. Yes
       we cannot accelerate matter to the speed  of light due to friction, but
       for all purposes we don't know that yet.

            Let's just say we can for now and friction and  other  factors  do
       not have an  effect on our box. This friction and other factors is what
       Chuck Yeager thought he found at Mach  one as the demon. Well the demon
       is there but way above Mach one and way below the speed  of  light. The
       demon is friction  and  resistance  factors  of  which we don't need to
       worry about in our pictorial view.   [See  Fig.4  & 5] Now let's say we
       just found some  super  fuel called Element 115 for  now.  This  is  an
       inside pun, but  it  will do for those of you who need a physical means
       to drive our box to and beyond the speed of light.

            We now set our box the Z axis in motion along the direction to the
       right on the X axis or acceleration  plane.  As  we  accelerate  to the
       speed of light we will start to bend Space/Time itself.  This means our
       Z axis will  start  to swing up toward our Y axis as  we  approach  the
       speed of light. [ See Fig. 5, A, B & C ] Notice if we redraw our box in
       reference to our  grid  the  box will seem to elongate as space/time is
       bent. This is what Einstein was talking  about  in  relativity with the
       Lorentz Transformation.

            Keep in mind at this point we are not moving along  with  the  new
       box but looking  at  it from its original starting point. If we were to
       move with the box we would see no change  in  the  space warp as to the
       box itself.  In  other words the box would not seem  to  elongate  from
       within its own  reference  point  but  only from the original observers
       viewpoint.

            Now in our three dimensional space/time there is one thing that we
       perceive in only two dimensions and  that is a shadow of which light is
       a contributing factor.  Now from our orignal reference  point  when  we
       reach the speed  of light the box would be perceived as a beam of light
       and the matter axis would have been  warped  or bent back on itself and
       from our original observer point would no longer be in our 3D space.

            At that  point if we continue to accelerate with  our  super  fuel
       Element 115 to  two  times the speed of light we are now swapping our X
       axis for the Y axis since we have flipped  90 degrees and the box is in
       its new dimension.


                                        Page 2





            When the  box  once  again  reaches another C in acceleration from
       delta one we would once again see the  box  but it would be 180 degrees
       out from our old 3 dimensional point. After it reaches three C and goes
       on to 4 C then you can kiss it goodbye for all practical purposes.

            How long  before we ever reached one C we found  that  demon  that
       Yeager was looking  for. Now friction and the other resistive factors [
       The Demon ] tell us Mother Nature will  never  allow us to approach the
       problem of acceleration  to  the  speed of light by shear  brute  force
       alone. How sad,  for  I think we were on to something if it just wasn't
       for this Demon.

            Wait! there is still hope. Let's  fool  Mother  nature.  Is  there
       another way to bend Space/Time itself? Mother nature does  it every day
       herself.

            Before we  can  go  on  we  must  stop  and  look  at just what is
       Space/Time itself. It's been called  the  Aether  among  other  things.
       Let's just look at it as Jello or flexible rubber that  is realitive to
       us.  It can  and  is  detected  but  misunderstood  as  electromagnetic
       fields.

            RF radiation  or wave propagation  through  this  space  time  are
       constructed with electromagnetic fields but in such a  manner that they
       cause propagation in space time where electromagnetic fields alone only
       stress, twist and distort space time.

            When the  fields  are  removed  by  cutting off electron flow in a
       conductor [ coil ] the space time  snaps  back  to  the form before the
       distortion. This brings us to just what is this space time we have been
       talking about?

                                     THE AETHER:

            This flexible rubber, Jello or what ever you wish to call it is
       Space Time itself or what Space Time is made up of. It  has been called
       the Aether in the past so we shall also call it the Aether.

            Now I know there has been debates on the existance of an Aether or
       not for many years. The last acceptance was that it did not exist.  For
       thoses of you  who wish to research into this aspect may wish to review
       the Silvertooth experiment. "

       Abstract #1: Michelson-Morley type  experiments  are  shown  to be non-
                    sequitors because their logic fails to  take  into account
                    the relationship   between   wavelength   and  propagation
                    velocity. An experimental demonstration of anisotropy
                    in wavelength is described." [1] "

       Abstract #2: After a lapse of 100 years  the Silvertooth experiment has
                    achieved Michelson's  objective and detected  the  Earth's
                    motion through   space   by   optical   interference.  The
                    consequences of this new  experiment will have a traumatic
                    effect on physics. A related issue is the question of
                    reinterpreting the   null  result  of  the   Trouton-Noble
                    experiment, the    electrodynamic    equivalent   of   the
                    Michelson-Morley experiment." [2]

            Now nature distorts this Aether all the time by natural proccesses
       that take place.  We  can  see  the results and feel this distortion as
       pressure of the Aether [ 3 dimensional Space/Time ].

            If you have ever placed two magnets next to each other you can see
       and feel the attracting or repelling forces involved in this distortion
       of Space/Time. We call this magnetic  flux  but it is the actual Aether
       you feel and see as movement taking place.

            Now if we send electrons down a conductor we find  a magnetic flux
       is generated in  accordance  to the left hand rule. That is the flux or
       Aether is moving in the direction or  twisting  in the direction of the
       left hand rule based on direction of electron flow or travel.

               [ See Extraordinary Science, Volume 1, Issue 2, page 9 ]

            In figure  2  I  have  attempted to show the flux  from  a  moving
       electron down a  conductor.  I  did  not display it as I had wished. In
       reality, it will look more like a spring as the flux lags the electrons
       movement through the Aether.

            Now we see that not only can nature produce a small space/time
       distortion with the distortion being the magnetic fields themselves but
       man can generate   the   same   distortions    but    controled    with
       electromegnetics. Since this is true then man can get around the
       demon by bending space/time [ Aether ] with Scalar technology of
       which electromagnetics makes up such processes. See Fig. 3.

            To bend  Space/Time  and produce time travel or  invisibility  you
       will need to build at least four generators. One of the generators will
       need to be  as  a  time  reference point for the other three generators
       which control the bending of the X, Y, and Z axis.  [ See Fig. 4 & 5. ]

            We will be going over this again and again in the future as I show
       more and more of the actual mechanism  in producing such effects. It is
       only important to  obtain  a  slight  pictorial  view   of   how   this
       application is linked to Scalar Technology.

            There is  a  lot  more  involved than this simple view I have just
       given but I  hope  you have a little  better  understanding  of  how  a
       proccess can actually be produced and what you may be  playing  with in
       your search to  understand Scalar.  Remember I have presented this view
       on a linear plane of which it is not in reality.

            It can be done on a spherical  plane  but  what  it will look like
       will be a  mirror  image  folding in on itself. For  now  just  try  to
       understand it using our 3D Space/Time Cube.  This application will fall
       in the field of The Philadelphia Experiment, Hyperspace drives and Time
       travel.  We have  only  begun  our  journy  into Scalar Technology. The

       Part I

       By Warren E. York

               A SECOND APPLICATION OF SCALAR TECHNOLOGY: GRAVITY

                                [ CORRECTIONS ]

            I wish  to  point  out  a  correction  in FIG.3 of last issue. The
       direction of the arrows indicating Aether  rotation and stated as being
       the same thing  as  a  magnetic  field is shown going  in  the  counter
       clockwise direction for the positive end or right side of the drawing.

            This flow  should  be  changed  to show clockwise rotation for the
       right side or positive side only. This error was noticed due to  recent
       developments and observations of Aether  mechanics.  This  brings me to
       the correction on the second error which was stated  as  the Aether and
       EMF [magnetic flux field] being one in the same thing.

            This is half true. It is now my understanding that the Aether flow
       is inverse to the magnetic flux flow and non symmetrical to it. Fig 2.
       For those of you who are technicians or professionals, you should be
       aware of the two electron flow theories.

            The first  and  accepted  one is that positive energy travels from
       positive to negative from a battery  or  source through a conductor and
       the not so accepted but also true theory of hole flow.

            That is  the empty space left in an atom's outer  orbit  which  is
       like a hole  which  travels  backwards  in the conductor. That would be
       negative to positive.

            So the new understanding is that  the  Aether  flow  is inverse to
       magnetic flow. Electrons and Aether flow interact with  each other. The
       next correction is  a  typo of the word Ether. I had spelled Either and
       it should be Aether to indicate other  than  the gas called Ether. [See
       last  ssue]

                                [ RESEARCHERS ]

            Matt Campbell currently employed by the U.S. Government has taken
       me up on my offer to form a small think tank research team. Matt
       lives here in  El Paso, Texas and has a strong background  on  the  new
       technologies. He had read my article on Scalar Technologies and found a
       direct relationship with  his  own  study on Vortexes. He learned I was
       right here in the same town and called to drop by and compare notes.

            We learned we were both studying  the  same  thing  and decided to
       join ideas and reasoning which I have already set into motion under the
       title Scalar Technologies. Since we have joined forces  our  deductions
       have progressed to the engineering of a proto type model test coil. Fig
       1A.

            Dr. Henry  C.  Montieth  has agreed to work with us and review our
       work so as to keep us on track and  prevent  wasted  man  hours  on  an
       improper assumption or an erroneous test run.  Dr. Montieth  has twenty
       years of service with Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, New

                                        Page 5





       Mexico; he holds  a PhD in applied Physics as well as a Master's degree
       in electrical engineering.

            Dr. Montieth has written several  papers  of which one I will list
       here under references [19] for those of you who wish  to  review how he
       thinks in relation to our work. He knows of Lt.  Col Tom Beardon's work
       and is a  theoretical  physicist  himself.  As  an  educated critic his
       understanding of our approach will be most helpful in this study.

            I am in the process of contacting  other  researchers  but time to
       fit everything into  one  day is hard to find. My personal  feeling  is
       that the most  knowledgeable  man  in  this field I have come across to
       date is Dr. Moray B. King.  I am  in  hopes  he  will  join  us in some
       behalf in this study in the near future. You may have  seen  one of his
       papers here in  Extraordinary Science, Oct/Nov/Dec 1989, page 8, Scalar
       Current. I have talked with him over  the  phone but to date strange as
       it may seem we have not had the chance to compare notes and thoughts.

            From what I have read of his thinking from his book  [ Tapping The
       Zero-Point Energy ]  we  have  come up with the same deductions without
       knowing of each others work. I would  also  like  to  give  my  special
       thanks to Theodor  Ernst  Bart a research and development  engineer  in
       Switzerland for RCA  laboratories.   Through his own research in scalar
       technology he has sent me lab photos Fig 2. showing Aetheric flow using
       a color TV screen as an instrument.   This idea was first suggested and
       done by Lt.  Col Tom Beardon.

            If others wish to contact Matt Campbell, Dr. Montieth or myself on
       related work, questions or additional information you  may write to our
       new central mailing address in care of:

            All inquiries  will  be  handled  through  this address or you may
       still call 915  521-5610.  Dr. Montieth  will  be  joining  us  on  the
       computer net for  those  of  you who wish to join our  information  net
       which is online 24 hours a day.

            In our  approach  we  review  the  work  and  papers  of others to
       formulate and engineer working models  of  our  own  on  the  different
       concepts. In short  we are trying to take ideas and concepts  and  turn
       them into reality  through  working  experiments and practical devices.
       Your insight and suggestions are welcome  to  help formulate and narrow
       down these tests.

                                       GRAVITY

            In our  last  issue  I  had  discussed  how  scalar  may relate to
       interdimensional doorways or windows. Since this time I have obtained
       a short video of such a process actually taking place. The manipulation
       of Time and Space itself or better termed manipulation of the Aether.

            I did not go into how to actually  make  a  doorway  or window but
       only show how Scalar is a part in the process to develop such a device.
       Hence when you manipulate time and space you also will have effects
       of gravity. There is a lot of work to be done with this process and
       for obvious reasons it is very tricky, involved and dangerous.

            Without a  time  sync or Aether flow lock one could  end  up  with
       matter embedded within matter as reported in Project Rainbow
       [ Philadelphia Experiment  ].  Before  we can go on to discuss just how
       scalar technology can produce gravity  we need a pictorial view of just
       what gravity is.

            Notice I did not say anti-gravity. That brings us to just what is
       gravity? Has anybody ever explained the true nature of gravity to you?
       In other words what gravity really is or its makeup?

            Well some people say it is a pressure or outside  force and others
       say it is a wave or something called a graviton that makes it up. Still
       they have been  unable  to  identify  it  in  a  test. We can detect it
       because we see the effect of it but  we  cannot  describe the nature of
       just what it really is.

            If you  look  at  the equations of EMF or Maxwells  equations  and
       those of gravity  you will see similarities in nature. If you have ever
       played with two magnets and seen and  felt  the fields you are close to
       just what the true nature of gravity is. If we look  at  the properties
       of EMF we  find  two  polarities or charges if electrostatic. That is a
       minus and a plus.

            In EMF, like charges repel and  unlike  attract.  You can see this
       with the north  and south poles of a magnet. Place two  souths  or  two
       norths together and  you will notice the repulsion.  Likewise place two
       like poles together and you will see the attraction.

            The earth has a North pole and  a  South  pole just like a magnet.
       Fig 2A I know what you are thinking, but no, gravity is  not a magnetic
       field or at  least  not as we know magnetic fields to be.  The best way
       is to give you a pictorial view of the mechanics of gravity.

            Take a  look  at  Fig.3A, an electron's  graphic  orrery  and  its
       interactions with the   Aether.  The  Aether  is  a   fluid   grid   of
       reciprocating type of  energy  which  is  omnidirectional,  has duality
       properties and is that of all time  and  space  is  made of; however, I
       will not go into what the exact nature of the Aether is at this time.

            Now when we send this electron down a conductor  Fig  5 from outer
       orbit to outer orbit of each atom in the conductor we are moving on the
       direction line or  "I" the inertia line represented as the X axis.  Fig
       3A.

            Notice in Fig 5 the cone or spiral  shaped rotation the Aether and
       the inverse flow of the  magnetic flux field takes. Now in Fig 2A. if

                                        Page 7





       you look at the electron in respect as it being earth then you will see
       its magnetic Aether  inverse flux fields around its axis of rotation or
       EMF flux fields as north and south poles [labeled "P"].

            Now picture all these electrons in the outer orbits of each bit of
       matter on Earth and the Earth rotating  on it pole axis. Fig 1. This is
       what gives earth its magnetic flux and inverse Aether  fields and north
       and south poles.   Fig  2A. The "F" or flux field is what is known as a
       closed loop of Aether rotation. Keep this in mind for this accounts for
       the similarities in  formulas  of electromagnetic  fields  and  gravity
       formulas.

            Electromagnetic having plus or minus or attraction  and  repulsion
       and gravity only  having attraction. To produce a gravity field all one
       has to do is create an Aether flow pump  which is in one direction. Now
       how does matter or a planet produce this Aether pump that we observe as
       gravity? Fig 1  The  nucleus of the atom plays a part  but  once  again
       let's keep it simple and just look at one aspect for now.

            Movement of  matter  through  the Aether due to spin on [ just for
       now ] the electron causes friction  on  the  Aether. If you move Aether
       through mass you get gravity. If you move mass through  Aether  you get
       inertia.

            By the  way,  the  Aether  itself causes the spin of the electron.
       They can effect each other and this  is  where friction is termed. Time
       and space is  moving  through  our  ball  of  matter and  from  another
       viewpoint matter is moving through time and space, time and space being
       the Aether or one in the same.

            Aether is  omnidirectional  reciprocating energy and it can impart
       that energy in the form of rotation of the electron since they interact
       with each other. Now this friction  which  is  the  imparting mechanism
       between the Aether and the electron and will direct or curve the Aether
       to an extent from the surface of the electron.

            Put a  bunch of these little spinning surfaces together  and  they
       direct or pump the Aether to the center of the matter in question.  Fig
       1.  Aether being  energy  with  no  mass can fill an infinite amount of
       space at the center with no problem of conflict with itself.

            There is no difference in a  bucket  of  Aether  or  a  pinhead of
       Aether.  It takes up no space since it is energy and what space is made
       of.  This also is where the duality of the Aether comes  in. By space I
       also mean empty  space or the lack of matter.  Matt's vortex technology
       holds true to this process.

            Scalar is a means of engineering  controlled  vortex in a specific
       manner to produce  a  desired  effect. Using scalar technology  we  can
       produce this Aether  pump [Aether Diode] with control.  This means that
       we can produce a gravity point and  everything  within  our  field will
       fall to that point with no effect on the normal gravity  field produced
       by the planet since our new field overrides the earth's field.

            With a  balance  between  this  new point and the planet's gravity
       field, or pump, we can have control  of  field enclosed matter. This is
       why I did not say anti-gravity for we generate our own gravity which is
       not really anti-gravity.  There  is  a  video  tape   out   which  will
       demonstrate this effect in part.[15] Longitudinal waves, or RC, as Matt

                                        Page 8





       and I call it is put through a light bulb [ with no gases only a vacuum
       ].  Standard current gives off the glow of photons and heat can be felt
       from the lamp.

            When RC  current  is  used the lamp is brighter, cool to the touch
       and has new   noticeable   characteristics   besides   the   color   of
       illumination.  First,it has  electrostatic  characteristics   where   a
       copper mesh ribbon  will  be  attracted to the source of the light; and
       secondly your hand can feel the pressure Aethric flow from the source.

            This pressure is omni-radial Aether flow or kin to gravity but not
       in the form of a monopole direction  yet. This is the start of building
       what can be called a tractor-beam device. Thats one that can attract or
       repel matter as down a laser beam. Dr. Z, I am told, is working on just
       such a device. Nature produces a monopole flow of Aether  all  the time
       in matter and we call this gravity. Fig 1.

                   REALIZATION OF A NEW FORM OF ENERGY GENERATED
                         [ RC ] or Reciprocating Current

            In a recent understanding of scalar technology Matt and myself
       have come to  a  realization  of a new form of energy which is produced
       and needed to drive this Aether pump to produce gravity.

            We are not the first to discover  it but the first to go on record
       calling it RC  [  Reciprocating  Current  ] Dr. King  calls  it  Scalar
       Current and Dr. Nikola Tesla called it longitudinal waves.

            Now Tesla   was   known   for  AC  [  Alternating  Current  ]  and
       Westinghouse for DC [ Direct Current  ].  Direct current is the current
       from a battery cell with negative to positive flow [  hole  theory ] or
       positive to negative flow [ electron flow theory ].

            We can  thank  Tesla for our using AC voltage today. He found that
       AC was more efficient and could travel longer distances without need of
       amplification. We have not done away with DC, for it is still needed
       in car batteries flashlights, and portable  electronic equipment. We do
       not use DC  through the house wiring because AC is the  more  efficient
       for this purpose.  With RC, DC and AC will still be needed, but RC will
       have some advantages over AC or DC.  RC  voltage  will  travel  on  the
       surface of the   conductor   therefore   giving   characteristics    of
       superconductivity.

            That is  to  say  that  resistance will not be of great importance
       with RC.  It is known as cold electrons due to this ability and most
       incandescent lamps will  almost never  burn  out  due  to  very  little
       heating up of the filament.

            You would  not be able to use RC voltage on an electric  stove  or
       heating blanket or total electric heater.

            Another property   of  RC  is  electrostatic  characteristics.  RC
       voltage will travel down a conductor  almost  like  microwave does in a
       waveguide.

            The E [ electric ] and B [ magnetic ] fields have traded positions
       with the B field being longitudinal now to the conductor. Fig 5A [23]

                                        Page 9





            This is  where  Tesla  got  the name longitudinal wave. Matt and I
       choose to use RC due to it fitting into the scheme of things along with
       AC and DC.

            No big changes will be needed  to  adapt  RC  to  the now existing
       wiring. Most likely RC will be generated off the main line used for AC
       at the point of need. Likewise DC will be used in much the same way as
       far as application.

            I don't think you will find large RC power plants  for  this would
       be impractical and not needed. A Tesla coil will produce this RC energy
       or you may  wish to build a coil similar to our test coil being used to
       map the fields and properties of RC current. Fig 1A,1B & 4A

            Unlike this basic construction  given  here of an RC generator our
       test coil has eight primaries of which only four are shown  in Fig 4A &
       1B and my scalar coil described in Jul/Aug/Sep issue as the secondary.

            It turns  out  that  coil  described  in  issue  Jul/Aug/Sep  1989
       Extradordinary Science, page 16 will  generate  scalar  activity but is
       better used as  an  induction receiving coil for this  RC  energy.  The
       coils are self  tuned  through  K1  which  is  a  adjustable  induction
       vibrator. Fig 6A.[22]

            I want to recap for just a minute and then present a paper written
       by Matt Campbell on our work. Matt will be saying the same thing but
       in a different manner.

            Between the two of us we hope  you  will get a clearer view of the
       important points we are trying to bring out to assist  you  in your own
       research into this fantastic technology and related topics.

            Our present  work is in mapping of the fields. The following recap
       is what we have found or are in the  process  of  finding to be true or
       not true in this research.

               1.  The Aether exists. It is Time and Space itself. [1]
               2.  The Aether is reciprocating omnidirectional  grid of energy
                   by nature. [19]
               3.  The Aether and EMF are gyroscopic in nature.
               4.  The  Aether  has  properties  of  duality.  The Aether is a
                   fluidatic energy Fig 7A.  and  follows  some  of  the fluid
                   dynamic laws  of  other  known  fluids  but   unique   with
                   additional properties  being  that  of  a fluidatic energy.
                   Mass and energy properties  kind  of  like  the photon. The
                   photon may  be the Aether itself but in a  different  form.
                   Light is  matter  ninety  degrees  to  the Aether or our 3D
                   Space/Time and the Aether is light ninety degrees to matter
                   in our 3D Space/Time.[See last Issue]
               5.  The Aether is relative to the speed of light.
               6.  The Aether interacts with  the  electron  and  perhaps  the
                   proton.Fig 4
               7.  The Aether is an inverse flow of the EMF flux field but non
                   symmetrical. It can form nodel lodes or  zones  unlike  the
                   closed loop of flux in a magnetic field.
               8.  The  fluid  flow  of  Aether  reacts  on  the surface of an
                   electron as the water vortexes  do on earth. The flows will
                   be " Hi's to Lo's" but relative to your  reference  and the
                   poles of spin. Fig 2.

                                       Page 10





               9.  Aether moving through Mass gives Gravity effects. Fig 7A
              10.  Mass moving through the Aether gives Inertia effects. [Like
                   in a Gyro]
              11.  A  conductor  moving through a EMF flux field or a EMF flux
                   field moving through a conductor gives electrons.
              12.  Electrons moving through a conductor gives you EMF flux.
              13.  In the flux field flow  the  North  and South Pole would be
                   the same as a Lo in Aether flow flux and the  equator would
                   be a Hi. Fig 3.
              14.  Without Aether nothing would exist. It is time/space and
                   existence itself.
              15.  Scalar  technology  is  but  one method of munipulating the
                   Aether but unique do to  the results it produces. It is the
                   key factor in studying and understanding gravity,  time and
                   relativity.
              16.  All  Aether  effects  can  be  obtained  and explained from
                   conventional methods now in practice.
              17.  I suspect the proton and  neutron  interact with the Aether
                   also.

            I feel the neutron has the biggest play in this  role  of gravity.
       Further investigation will  be  needed to find out but the neutron is a
       happy particle with  the  same  equalness   or  balance  of  charge  in
       relationship to mass  so  to  speak  as  the  Aether has  an  equalness
       [reciprocating] of high's and lo's in relationship to energy.[2]

            To make it simple I feel the neutron tends to lock into the Aether
       itself due to gyroscopic action and is pulled along with the flow where
       the electron and  proton  are  only  part  of the total balance of this
       vortex where they effect or warp the  Aether  to  each  it's  own happy
       balance of the total reciprocation or vortex.[20]

            There is much testing and exploring to be done.   I hope this will
       give some of  you new insight into your own research and you will share
       your findings with the rest of us. This  info will only get us into the
       ballpark but I feel that is a good place to start for  we are closer to
       home plate now then left field where man has been for some time.

            The door  is  only unlocked. It is time to peek in and explore for
       all mankind both present and past. Warren E. York 1990

            You had  the  stars  in  your  hand  and  you almost let them slip
       through your fingers. Let the reader  please  keep  in  mind  that this
       paper is open to debate and experimentation. Changes  to  the  theories
       introduced here will appear in later works.

            Also a  note  on  the  nature  of  the Aether, namely that as pure
       energy it reciprocates from highs to lows, and takes on characteristics
       of duality like a photon but is unique in its own right.

                            BEYOND THE EVENT HORIZON

                                      By
                                 Matt Campbell
                            and Joint Research with
                                  Warren York

            This paper is to show some of the fields of energy associated with
       relativity and reveal new forms of  energy  which  can  be derived from
       these fields. Future  papers  will explain the relationships  of  these
       forms of energy with the unified field theory and the mechanics
       of relativity.

            The Silvertooth experiment [1] proves that the Aether exists. The
       nature of the  Aether  as  that  of  pure energy, flowing like a fluid,
       elastic like a rubber band, and forming a 3-D grid filling all parts
       of space from microcosmic to macrocosmic scales.[2]

            When stress is placed on the Aether  grid  free energy is produced
       [3] and the reference point which mankind uses to observe  his universe
       shifts.[4] The Aether     is     responsible     for    electrostatics,
       electromagnetism, gravity, nucleonic  forces,  and  possibly  even  the
       mystery of life  [5]  and  consciousness  itself. Without  the  Aether,
       nothing can exist in the universe as man knows of it today.

            Gravity is an illusion manufactured by the Aether flow orienting
       itself towards the center of a mass. Hence matter behaves like an
       Aether pump. [6] A mass moving with equal speed with the Aether will
       feel no gravitational pull, however when halted in the flow, a
       resulting " Gravitational " field is felt by the mass. This can be
       referred to as Aether pressure. Fig. 1

            From Fig 1 one can deduct that a " Gravitational Field " increases
       towards the surface of a mass, decreases from the surface towards the
       center of said mass, and that no limitation need be placed upon the
       number of nodal lines depicting Aether pressure since said Aether
       pressure has no mass.

            If the  force  of  gravity  pulling  down  upon a mass towards the
       center of another mass is an illusion produced by Aether pressure which
       is Aether flow in one direction, then  tidal  forces  and  rotation  of
       cosmic bodies can be explained.[7]

            When the Aether flow forms a loop instead of a vector,  a magnetic
       field is the  result.  The  direction of the flow of the nodal lines of
       force of a magnetic field is also an  illusion,  produced by the Aether
       flowing in the opposite direction.  See figure 2. [8]



                                       Page 12





            This theory  fits  the aether model, but remains to be proven. The
       following depiction of an electrostatic  field  is  also subject to the
       same test.

            In  n  electron  gravity,  rotation,  magnetic and  static  fields
       exist.[2] The same  should  hold true for the proton. The proton cannot
       be ignored in the mechanics of the  Aether  since it constitutes such a
       large part of the atom.

            Logically when one affects the electrons surrounding  the  nucleus
       of an atom,  then  the  nucleus must also be affected. Figure 3 depicts
       the fields associated with an electron.

            If the poles are reversed for  a  proton,  the  equator becoming a
       high and the  poles becoming a low, then the Aether flow  is  reversed,
       causing the proton  to act as a sink for the static field and since the
       electron already acts as a source for  the  static field, an attraction
       results between the electron and proton. [9] See figure 4

            Without becoming involved any further in the atomic structure of
       the atom, electron  flow  in  a  conductor will be reviewed  since  the
       object of this paper is to map the electromagnetic fields surrounding
       a conductor when a potential is applied.

            Referring to figure 5  When a potential [c] is placed at the ends
       of conductor [a] the electron [b] begins to accelerate. At this point
       voltage is almost zero, current is very high, power is almost zero,
       resistance is nearly zero and power propogation [h] in the form of
       heat is at the temperature of the rest of the conductor.

            A magnetic  vorticity [n] forms [f] that is centripetal in nature,
       and the Aether [g] forms a centrifugal field. When the electron reaches
       the point of maximum acceleration at  the  end of vector [d] voltage is
       high, current is low, power is high and resistance is high.

            Maximum power  [s] in the form of heat occurs. Also  the  electron
       [b] no longer  "feels  gravity"  since acceleration is complete and the
       electron [b] is moving at the same  rate  as the Aether flowing between
       the potential.

            When the  potential is removed the opposite occurs  in  all  cases
       with the exception of the direction of Aether vorticity. See Fig.6.

            An Aether vorticity is formed, and the magnetic field becomes
       centrifugal in nature. From this one can see that the right hand rule
       for the Aether vortex is the only apparent constant in time, and active
       when an electron is being accelerated or resisted [10].

            Taking this into consideration and Aether vacuum forms between
       two conductors when a potential is applied or removed, the potentials
       being in the same direction. See fig. 7.

            To reiterate  the  processes  of  manufacturing  a combined Aether
       vorticity a potential [c] is placed  at  the  ends  of  conductors  [a]
       accelerating   electron  [b] along vector  [d]  to the point of maximum
       acceleration  [e]  producing Aether   flow  vorticity   [f]   which  is
       combining   the   Aether  vorticities of conductors [a] and eliminating
       Aetheric nodal lines of force form between the two conductors producing
       an Aetheric vacuum between the conductors which grows with time

                                       Page 13





       reaching a maximum level at [e] and forming a cone of zero point energy
       [g].

            The elasticity of the Aether is responsible for moving mass offset
       from the center point between the two conductors as the Aether vacuum
       increases. This can be demonstrated when a third conductor is placed
       between the first two and parallel with the same. Figure 8 is an axial
       view of this process.

            When electron  flow  [b]  is  initiated through conductors [a] the
       Aether vortex flow [c] moves electrons  [d] from the center to the edge
       of the middle  conductor.  This  type  of  current   will   be   called
       reciprocating current, since the electrons oscillate from the center to
       the edge and back again in the middle of the conductor.[12]

            This reciprocating  current  is  directly  related with zero point
       energy discussed earlier and possess a novel effect which is unusual in
       electrical theory but can at least be partially explained with modern
       electrical theory.

            Fig.9 Demonstrates the effects reciprocating current produces in a
       conductor. As electrons [b] move  from  the  centerf  conductor  [a]  a
       magnetic vortex is formed[c] which constructs a mirror image of itself.

            A resulting  magnetic loop [f] is formed along  the  edge  of  the
       conductor [a] which resembles a magnetic monopole when conductor [a] is
       introduced into a  complete  circuit.  The two magnetic loops formed by
       the two electrons are mutually bucking.  The  center  of  conductor [a]
       possess a positive charge and the edge is negative.

            Power dissipation  in  the  form  of thermal radiation  dissipates
       along the length  of  the  conductor  as  well  in the Y to Z plane. In
       summary, thermal radiation and the  magnetic  field  forms  in  the Y-Z
       plane, and electrostatic potential forms in the X to Y plane.

            Note that a capacitor vaguely simulates the same  effect, but uses
       a dielectric instead.  This  process  can  be  partially recreated with
       conventional electricity such as AC  or  DC,  but  cannot be completely
       duplicated.

            The conductor takes on new characteristics, appearing  as a super-
       conductor since the  electrons  never reach their maximum speed and are
       arrested in their paths at the boundary of the conductor.

            The electrostatic field formed  must exist among the entire length
       of the conductor in a circuit,causing the conductor  to  behave  like a
       waveguide. Therefore reciprocating    current    has    minimum   power
       dissipation and transfers its energy with a waveguide effect.

            Towards the center of the conductor  on the Y-Z plane the magnetic
       and Aetheric fields   cancel,   leaving  one  field   accounting   for,
       gravitation.

            Recall the  Aether  grid,  if  the  Aether is cancelled on the X-Y
       plane and the Y-Z plane, then it still  exists  on  the  X-Z  plane and
       manifests itself as gravity.

            Gyroscopic precession can control this element.  in  Fig. 4 when a
       bucking magnetic vorticity produced in [c] of Fig. 9 encounters the

                                       Page 14





       poles of either  the  electron  or  proton, the electron or proton must
       flip ninety degrees towards the center of attraction between the two.

            If one flips, the other must  also  flip  to  compensate  for  the
       bucking fields and reach equilibrium.  when this occurs,  the  rotation
       of the mass  is  arrested  and  a  new  direction of rotation begins to
       result.

            During this period of change  gyroscopic  precession  attempts  to
       replace the rotation  mass  in  its  former position,  resulting  in  a
       pulling effect, the  same  force  that  manifests  itself  as  gravity,
       inertia and centrifugal force.

            If a larger mass consisting  of  a  great  number  of  atoms  were
       subjected to the  same  process,  the effect would constitute  all  the
       atoms acting as  a  gyroscope,  and  the  mass  in question should draw
       itself back to its former position.  This  is  a  crude  example  of  a
       gravitational field generator, [14] a device that forms a difference in
       Aether pressure in a given direction.

            Fig. 10 demonstrates how a small degree of control can be used
       with these fields to produce specific results. K1 is an adjustable
       relay. L1A, L1B, L2A, and L2B are electromagnets. B1 and B2 are
       bifilar windings in series.

            A full voltage spike wave is generated by K1. See  Fig. 11. On one
       cycle bucking magnetic  fields  are produced across B1 and reversed for
       B2. On the negative cycle the opposite is true.

            A reciprocating current occurs  across  the incandescent bulb. The
       bulb does not   give   off   heat  and  should  possess   electrostatic
       properties.

            A compass  placed  on the wire should not point perpendicular, but
       parallel with the wire instead. Aetheric  pressure  would  also be felt
       around the wire and incandescent bulb. [15]

            The primary reason for using bifilar windings is to insure the
       mutual cancellation of electric current and produce a universal
       bucking magnetic field. [11] B1 and B2 yield universal magnetic
       fields. See Fig. 12.

            Two electromagnets placed end to end does not do  the  same thing.
       See Fig 13.  When  the different coils are combined as in Fig. 10 zones
       of zero point energy exist on the  X-Z  plane,  the  Y axis and the Y-Z
       plane. This allows for some degree of control of the Aether grid.

            The incandescent bulb can be replaced by a coil.  Another coil for
       the second bifilar  winding  can  be  placed  on  top of the first at a
       ninety degree intersection  and  the  whole  wrapped  in  a  torroidial
       fashion [16] See Fig. 14.

            Upon close  examination  the  scalar  fields   produced   at   the
       intersection of the windings results in gyroscopic precession 13 of the
       atoms in all   planes   of   3D  space  towards  one  direction  and  a
       gravitational field is produced in  the  given  direction.  The torroid
       prevents torque from spinning the coil on its axis.

            When a 3-phase spike wave is introduced to the primaries of the

                                       Page 15





       separate scalar generators and the three separate torroidial coils
       are stacked like a sandwich [16] a continuous difference in aether
       pressure is produced in a given direction resulting in a constant
       gravitational field in the said direction. See Fig 15 and 16.

            This is levitation. If a second set of torroidial coils is placed
       adjacent to the  first,  the  gravitational  vectors  will  meet in the
       center. If this is done with all three  axis,  a strong omnidirectional
       gravitational field will form. See Fig. 17.

            This is the same thing that occurs naturally in a mass. An intense
       gravitational field will create a singularity at the intersection,
       thus reversing time.

            The power  level,  phasing  and  duration of the  activation  will
       determine how far  back  in time [17] the target will travel. This does
       not violate the laws of casualty or relativity.[18]

            For example,  if  a  dice is thrown,  only  one  of  six  possible
       outcomes will result. Five other possibilities still exist,  and if our
       target subject travels  backwards  on the world time line to the moment
       the dice was first thrown and throws  it  again, the possibilities of a
       different outcome are one in five.

            The same  holds true if said target subject travels  backwards  in
       time and prevents  his  parents  from  meeting.  In  order  for this to
       happen, he had to travel back in time.  But  his  genetic structure and
       life history has been altered.

            The life history of our target subject should eventually  lead  to
       the construction and operation of the time control device. See Fig. 18.

            According to   this  theory,  a  very  high  number  of  alternate
       realities exist with each passing event.

            In conclusion, it seems to the writer of this paper a humorous
       trick to use a 1.5 volt battery and a wire to shift mankind's reference
       point from one possible reality to another,  however these theories are
       open to debate and experimentation.
