Hi Rick!  Have you ever heard of a fellow named Pearson from England?

It seems he has done some major investigation of how free energy devices can
be developed using the same interference techniques as Bearden talks
about.....Dan sent me a copy of a couple of papers this guy wrote and I plan
to order the books......there seem to be several but the pamphlet 'Free Energy
from the Vacuum' spells it out very well...

This guy is Ronald D. Pearson and his material is available from Michael Roll,
28 Westerleigh Road, Downend, Bristol BS16 6AH...

The books are 'Origin of Mind'............................3 pounds each
              'Free Energy from the Vacuum'...............2 pounds each
              'Intelligence Behind the Universe'.........10 pounds
              'Quantum Gravitation & Grand Unification'...5 pounds
              'The Colossus'..............................5 pounds
              'The Physics of Healing'....................1.50 pounds

There is no date on the material I have so I don't know if the address is
still valid, but its worth an enquiring postcard which I plan to send for
current prices, etc...

Anyway, this guy says two like polarities (positive or negative) can be thrown
against each other and instead of annihilating, the primaries will increase in
number, by as much as 18% more than the original energies....from EACH
collision of opposites.  To clarify with a direct quote;

  ...with the vacuum underpinned by a compound medium of opposites we
  can call the 'ether', a whole new vista appears.  Now energy CAN be
  created or destroyed - provided negative and positive energies change
  TOGETHER in EXACTLY balanced amounts!  (can you say scalar???)

  ...At first this seemed to present a difficulty.  Would not the two
  halves of ether MUTUALLY ANNIHILATE as primaries of opposite energy
  collided at high speed?

  ...it turned out that the need to conserve momentum prevented MUTUAL
  annihilation of energies from occurring during collisions.  Indeed the
  two conservation laws of energy AND momentum, which had to be applied
  SIMULTANEOUSLY, led to a totally different result.

  ...Instead of annihilating, primaries INCREASED in number!  In fact,
  18% MORE of BOTH kinds appeared, on average, from EACH collision of
  opposites.

  ...When primaries collide by approaching one another from any other
  direction, so that their trajectories intersect at some ARBITRARY
  ANGLE, the analysis is only made slightly more complicated.  Note it is
  necessary to consider RELATIVE velocities of approach.  From such
  vantage points some collisions will also APPEAR to be HEAD-ON, so
  yielding THE SAME RESULT as the one previously described.

  ...However, for collisions NOT HEAD-ON, a sideway SCATTERING MOTION is
  imparted.  And this applies equally to the general case just
  mentioned.  Each primary GAINS extra momentum in this transverse
  direction, the positive one gaining positive momentum and the negative
  one gaining the negative variety.  It follows that corresponding
  evaluation then yields the average gain ratio just quoted (18%).

  However, the positive and negative gains of both momentum and energy
  could CANCEL under conditions of MULTIPLE COLLISIONS (noise).  It
  therefore follows that everything that exists must ultimately have
  derived from the zero energy state of nothingness.

Amazing stuff!!  The point here is that the energies must be balanced IN ALL
RESPECTS, polarity (positive against positive, negative against negative),
amplitude and velocity...

He also has a drawing of a circuit that is almost identical to the one Alex
Frolov said Chernetskii used in his early experiments with the PLASMATRON...

I can't show it here easily but it shows a power source supplying >1000 volts
DC where one lead connects to an electric motor terminal and the other lead
goes to a switched capacitor and coil and into the other terminal of the
motor.  Their is a diagram of a spiky wave train which is continually
increasing in amplitude as the motor continues to run.

I suspect as it achieves a resonant frequency, these spikes will stabilize and
the motor will run very cool and with little if any energy input...guess I
need to try to draw that picture...will do so and post it before the
Thanksgiving mess is upon me....<g>...

Guess I'll call it PEARSON.ASC and the .gif PEARSON.GIF unless I can do it in
ASCII, hell maybe both...Dan did good on this one for sure...>>> Jerry

Some additional comments regarding Joe Newmans' machine;

Joseph Newman invented an electric motor which incorporated a rotating
permanent-magnet as its armature.  He claims it was able to produce many times
the power taken from the batteries, of about 1,000 volts, used to supply
"potential".  The main feature seems to be a long copper coil, sometimes made
from over fifty miles of wire, and leading from the battery to the motor.

Fast-acting switches, formed as a commutator on the motor shaft, enabled a
succession of 'spikes' to be generated.  These were waves of electric power
which surged down the coil from the battery and were 'gated' to the motor.

This means the magnetic field changes of the coil, caused by switching, were
so timed as to optimize the pushes and pulls it made on the magnetic poles of
the armature.  Newman then claims that spikes REFLECTED BACK along the coil
were gated to the battery causing it to be recharged!

Indeed trials are fully attested and on record in which a start ws made with
only partly charged batteries.  Then after driving a water pump for more than
an hour the batteries were tested and found to be fully charged!

Now according to conventional theory no reflected spike could have a high
enough voltage to recharge the battery even if the coil had NO electrical
resistance.  Taking resistance into account very little power would even
TRICKLE OUT at the end of the coil.

A quote from April 1993 Extraordinary Science;

  "There is a second kind of RF (radio frequency) produced which appears as a
   stair-step waveform.  The frequency of this RF energy seems to be related
   to the time required for the energy pulse to travel through the entire
   length of the copper coil.  The second kind of RF is somewhat mysterious
   and is, as yet, largely undefined.  According to oscilloscope measurements
   made by Dr. Hastings and Mr. Hartwell, the generation process appears to
   operate in a laser-like fashion in that the wave front of the energy
   produced seems to BOUNCE back and forth through the length of the coil
   winding, with the amplitude of the energy pulse GAINING additional energy
   with EACH BOUNCE through the coil."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vanguard Notes

Bearden said a stair-step waveform was most efficient for charging capacitors
in over-unity circuits.  In Chernetskii's circuit, a plasma, being the
'bridge' between energy and matter, was best suited to extract energy from the
vacuum.  Bearden also says ionized gases were highly sensitive to scalar type
perturbations.

Electronics generally indicates that if you can receive a signal or an energy,
you can reverse the process, pump up the circuit and TRANSMIT that same signal
or energy.  So, if a plasma circuit can be used to detect scalar/ether
perturbations, Chernetskii would be on the right track with the PLASMATRON.
He said an advanced version of his unit could power an entire city from a 9
volt transistor battery.

This ties in again with Farnsworth's FUSOR and MULTIPACTOR, where a very weak
exciter current can yield high electron multiplication for power generating
systems.

And finally, the use of Lenz law (back EMF) is often pointed out as a likely
means of extracting normally wasted electrical energy.  When a motor is
spinning free, with no load, it uses the minimum energy.  As the motor is
loaded, slight reverse torques cause the shaft to jerk backwards.  The
armature induces reverse spikes which conflict with the forward moving
currents.  This causes resistance, heating and loss of energy for lower
efficiency.  If you can extract these reverse currents, that energy can then
be accumulated and used.  Not only will the motor run cooler, but it will
require less current for higher overall efficiency.

Perhaps a long wire coil or a very high capacity could serve as the 'well' or
accumulator for this excess energy, even from this simpler energy extraction
process.  The possibilities are here, it just takes some experimentation and
effort to prove or disprove it.....................................>>> Jerry
