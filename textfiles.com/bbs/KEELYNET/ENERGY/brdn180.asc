  Why has Tom Bearden given up on Phase Conjagation?

  For many years,  Tom  Bearden (the "father" of scalar electromagnetics) has
  been touting "the way" to free energy, anti-gravity, etc.  This was through
  the use of phase conjugate principles.

  Scalar effects are produced by phase  conjugating  a wave by 180 degrees to
  cancel out the  energy,  yet  it  produces a "stress wave"  that  can  have
  physical effects.

  Many of us  who  study or research this field have been fans and friends of
  Bearden and were puzzled by his recent change to the "degenerate conductor"
  theories as specified in "The Final Secret" documents.

  How can "potential" ALONE drive circuits  which  we  KNOW  require CURRENT?
  The basic premise  of  the "Final Secret" rely on the oozing  of  potential
  (voltage) from the  inside  of a conductor to the outside edge.  (Is it not
  intriguing that DePalma and Tewari both  tap  this  central  shaft  area of
  stillness for the  production  of  electrons, just as described  by  Keely,
  Russell and others???)

  We know that current only flows over the surface of a conductor, therefore,
  as the electrons  reach  the  surface,  they  take  a  right angle turn and
  "translate" into CURRENT.  Only at that  point  does the circuit truly DRAW
  POWER.

  Bearden says that when you draw a current from a power source  that you are
  actually destroying that source.  However, if you draw only potential, then
  you don't affect the source in such a self-defeating way.

  A collector (capacitor  or  inductor)  is  used  to  collect  and  transfer
  potential from the  source....before  the  collector  "fills  up"  and  the
  potential translates to current, BOTH contacts are switched  into  a  load,
  where it instantly discharges.

  The collector is  then  re-connected to the source until it again recharges
  and the discharge  process  into the  load  repeats.   The  speed  of  this
  transaction determines the total energy supplied to the  load.   So, if you
  make it happen fast enough, you will be able to sustain that load.

  To date, I  am  not  aware  of  anyone  publicly demonstrating or releasing
  information relating to such a WORKING  circuit.  The closest person is Lee
  Trippett with his  TOD  circuit.   It  is  a  current amplifier  with  very
  peculiar properties, yet will not sustain a load.

  A most interesting extension of the TOD circuit is Bert Pool's modification
  into his "FireFly"  circuit  that  will source up to 6 LEDs (see FireFly on
  KeelyNet).  Although it appears to be  running  above  unity if you rely on
  digital meters, it really is not.

  The unique point  about  the  Firefly  is that the LED's  light  AFTER  the
  battery has been switched out of the circuit.  Presumably from the motion

                                     Page 1





  of the electron wave through the wire.  If this is so, then perhaps Bearden
  is really onto  something.   However,  the  question  is whether current is
  actually being drawn.  From Bert and Norm's  description of the experiment,
  specifically the use of amp meters to monitor the flow of  current into the
  wire in the  first  place,  there  is  current  drawn.   But  it  is a very
  interesting effect.

  We are told there was a laser researcher  who  figured that energy could be
  extracted from a properly conjugated laser cavity.  He succeeded yet before
  he could make  the  details of the process known, he was  killed  by  short
  range shotgun blasts  as  he  left  his  home.  The circumstances indicated
  silence was the motive for the killing.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  We took Tom  Bearden,  Ken MacNeill and  Bill  McMurtry  to  dinner  Friday
  evening with several others in our group.  I mentioned  to  Tom how several
  folks had wondered  why  he had given up on phase conjugation and done this
  complete shift over to the degenerate conductor idea.

  Tom says he has in no way given up on  phase  conjugate  theory but that he
  has gone as far as he could with what materials and research  tools he has.
  So, he decided  to  put some of his own observations out and those resulted
  in the Final Secret treatise.

  The work continues on these two primary  fronts (i.e. phase conjugation and
  degenerate conductors), but  with the main focus being  on  the  degenerate
  conductor approach.  According to Tom, there was nothing behind the change,
  simply that he decided to share an additional approach based on some of his
  own observations and thoughts.

  As of now,  the  next step in his own researches is the borrowing or buying
  of two Calibration Standard Capacitors.   Tom  needs  this for further work
  with his recently patent applied for free energy circuit.   If  he  can get
  them, he thinks it will prove his circuit.

  So, if you  know  where he could borrow a couple of these that you can loan
  out or buy to help out, these things  are  about  $2000 each, he would sure
  appreciate it.

  Phase Conjugation is still a very viable approach and one  that  we here at
  KeelyNet believe to  be right on track ABOVE everything else.  This follows
  the work of Keely and the entire field of music and resonance.  By creating
  interference patterns (constructive or  destructive), you can affect energy
  or mass.

  The ideal free energy device would use a tuned waveplate or a geometry that
  produces such a wavefront that it would "interfere" with  incoming energies
  to produce side  effects  as  specified  in  the  NEUTRAL1 Aether Spectrum.
  Those side effects would be collected or otherwise discharged for practical
  use.  Electricity, light or heat are  all  quite  practical using this down
  conversion method.

  That is one  of  the reasons for our interest in "Magic  Squares",  because
  they form the  geometries  that  can  act  as  kaleidoscopic multipliers or
  dividers of these incoming energies  or  simply  Aether/gravity  to keep it
  simple.  Small replicative circuits that produce large  quantities  of  the
  desired energy.

  An interesting quote made by John Keely was that a tuning fork or tuned bar
  will excite another fork/bar of the same frequency.

                                     Page 2





  So if you  place one thousand identically tuned bars in a room, then strike
  a single bar, all the bars would vibrate  and  thus produce AUGMENTATION of
  force!

  That is what we currently think Barium is doing in the Sweet VTA.  That is,
  it is AUGMENTING FORCE simply from the excitation of a single barium atom!

  Keely also indicates that in a DIFFERENTIATED MASS (such as a "conditioned"
  magnet), all of the "knotholes" or nodes of interference are removed.  Once
  this is done, the mass becomes essentially superconducting  because  of the
  instant communication of force throughout it's aggregate structure.

  When that occurs,  change  of one single molecule will instantly change ALL
  OTHER MOLECULES of like composition because the aggregrate has been attuned
  to a harmonious or "differentiated" condition.

  The point here is that phase conjugation  is  extremely  important  to  our
  quest for free energy devices because it defines the practical  application
  of frequency to produce effects.

  Another interesting point,  we were told that Barium Ferrite magnets are no
  longer available in  the U.S.  This because  the  government  decided  that
  Barium has toxic affects and is thus not "safe" for the  public.   Isn't it
  odd that Barium is also necessary for duplication of the Sweet VTA?

  Cold fusion also  requires  an unusual substance in the form of heavy water
  and shortly after the Pons/Fleischmann  release of the details, the largest
  heavy water manufacturer in the world went "out of business".

  Correlation here??  At the ISNE conference banquet, a book  was  shown that
  was produced by  the  United States Coast Guard.  It was titled "From 2012"
  or something like  that,  can't  find  the  note  on  it.   But  the  title
  definitely was 2012 and it was published in the last few  years  by  the US
  Coast Guard.  The   perspective  of  the  book  was  FROM  the  year  2012,
  describing extant conditions.

  One whole chapter was devoted to energy  generation  and  it WAS GIVEN THAT
  ZPE/VACUUM devices would  be  in  global use!!  This means  the  government
  either HAS the  technology  or  something  big is soon to break.  The whole
  impetus of GM and other auto manufacturers  towards electric cars is trying
  to tell us something.

  So, we need to get this stuff INTO PRACTICAL DEVICES and  posted EVERYWHERE
  in the public  domain BEFORE the technology can be monopolized or sealed up
  through patents by the big conglomerates!

  Like Dennis Weaver said at the Banquet,

       Money is like Manure, the higher you pile it, the more it stinks.

                 But if you SPREAD IT AROUND, IT GROWS THINGS!
