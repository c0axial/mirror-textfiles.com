            PRESENT-DAY ELECTRICAL GENERATION & ITS EFFECT ON THE EARTH
                                   by Alexander

       One thing we want to mention is the way you currently generate
       and transmit electricity and its effect on the weather.  The
       earth has an immune system, as a living organism, in the sense
       that it strives to maintain balance just as your body strives to
       maintain balance in all of its systems.

       The earth has to balance energy from two directions: one, from
       the cosmos, the sun being the principal energy, but there's all
       sorts of cosmic radiation.  The second is energy arising from
       the earth; there  are vibrational patterns, for instance in Southern
       California, which are highly unstable,  and  there  are  patterns in
       other areas of the earth that are sturdier.

       Weather - wind  and  precipitation  -  is  the earth  attempting  to
       balance these combined  energies  and  to diffuse them in a way that
       causes the least damage.  A single  bolt  of  lightning may strike a
       mountaintop, it will  defuse  this  tremendous buildup   of  energy,
       which if permitted  to  sprinkle  down  like  rain would fry a whole
       city.  So the approach is to diffuse  any  potential  danger  to the
       creatures of the earth by spreading out the imbalances  between  the
       cosmic energy and the earth energy in the form of weather.

       You may have  noticed  that  things  are  going  a bit awry with the
       weather lately.  Every winter seems  to  set  new  records  for cold
       temperatures and summers set records for high temperatures.
       Storms of increasing frequency and severity, snowfall of unusual
       depth, drought; these  are  all  reflections of the  fact  that  the
       earth's immune system  has  been  severely  impaired  by the way you
       transmit energy along high power  lines,  because  the  point  where
       cosmic energy and  earth  energy  meet in equal strength,  which  is
       where they blend,  is  between  five  and  25  feet from the earth's
       surface.  So here is where the earth's immune system is meant to


                                      Page 1





       kick in and  evaluate  the  pockets  of  unstable  energy  that  are
       developing and to diffuse them through weather.

       This whole process has been severely  disturbed  because this is all
       electromagnetic energy coming from the sun, coming  from  the earth,
       and by stringing  these  high-power  wires  literally  all  over the
       earth's surface, even under the ocean, you create this barrier, this
       sizzling blockage to  the earth's  being  able   to  truly  evaluate
       what's going on and to take corrective action.

       So the way  you  generate  electricity  from, say, one  power  plant
       sending out energy  for  hundreds  of miles, this system is severely
       disturbing the earth's  immune  system,   its  ability  to  maintain
       balance.  As a  result,  it's going to have to be dismantled.   Like
       anything, it can happen one of two ways.

       It can occur  that  you recognize that there's a violation occurring
       and you set about creating a system which relieves the violation or,
       failing that, you can have things  collapse  around you to the point
       that you are forced to abandon the path that violates the earth.

       It's not very likely that you would see utilities voluntarily  going
       out of business  and  giving  everyone  solar panels to put on their
       roof.  So what will happen, if this isn't addressed, is increasingly
       bizarre and unstable weather patterns which will increasingly affect
       food production.  These disturbances  will  cause  the appearance of
       insects which previously  would  have  kept in a tightly  controlled
       population, allowing them to explode in numbers.

       This is one  example  that we want to use for this process where you
       see something is a violation, you  recognize  it  because  there's a
       negative result accruing, and the question is, do you  make the easy
       transition by saying,  okay,  we're   violating  the  earth or we're
       violating some natural law, we need to bring this back into harmony.

       Or do you  allow the system to continue,  and  then  have  something
       collapse with such tremendous force and serious effect that you have
       to pay attention?   If  the breadbasket of the country  is  suddenly
       unable to provide food, what do you do?

       We've mentioned that  the current system of generating and supplying
       electricity will have to be abandoned  in  favor of local generation
       of energy at  the  community  level  or even at the  level  of  each
       individual dwelling providing its own power.

       So you would  have generation of electricity, then a greenbelt where
       there's no electrical generation so  that cosmic energy can meet the
       earth energy unhindered  and  undisturbed.   Imagine   pinpricks  of
       light, of electrical energy, in a sea of un-electrified country.

       You already have the technology, although it's crude, for generating
       electricity.  This science,  which is in its infancy, will evolve to
       a much more sophisticated level, and we suggest that it will largely
       use sound for electrical generation in the future.

       There exist blueprints in the realm  of consciousness for mechanisms
       which have an automatic feedback loop contained in them so that more
       sound energy is created than was put in, so part of it will go back


                                      Page 2





       into simply feeding   the  machine  to  create  the  sound  and  the
       remainder can be captured and used as electricity.

       As this evolves, it will not be  necessary  for  every  house  to be
       bristling on the  roof with solar panels that cost  a  fortune.   It
       will be something readily accessible to all regardless of the number
       of sunny and  cloudy  days  because  if you have a self-perpetuating
       feedback loop based on sound, rather  than dependent on the weather,
       then you have an eternal supply of energy.

       Vangard Notes

            The gist of this paper is that modification of weather patterns
            is due  to  the  energy  grids established by power lines.  The
            source claims that cosmic energy  meets  earth energy at a zone
            ranging from 5 to 25 feet above the surface of the earth.  This
            is where the energy blends and is diffused by the earth through
            normal "healthy" weather patterns.

            Suprisingly enough,  this  supports  the concept  of  cascading
            flows of Aether which pass into the neutral centers of mass and
            serve to sustain or dissolve matter.  The idea is that harmonic
            or enharmonic  energy  is  emitted  by  the  mass or the energy
            matrix which forms the mass  and  interacts  with the inflowing
            Aether to "create" the multiplicity of subsidiary  energies and
            effects we  perceive as gravity, magnetism, electricity, light,
            heat, sound, physical vibration and "static" mass aggregations.

            In the case of cosmic energy  per  se, the frequencies involved
            are already below the ability to generate gravity, magnetism or
            electricity THROUGH DIVISION, however, it is still  possible to
            up the frequencies by a proper infusion of phased and energetic
            frequencies.

            So, the  concept  presented  in  this  paper seems to have some
            merit.  If there is truly a "blending"  of energy at this zone,
            then it  should  be  measurable  by  using a power  grid  as  a
            reference and  looking  for  a  disparity of potential or other
            anomaly from  the  background  energy  level.   We  await  your
            comments.
