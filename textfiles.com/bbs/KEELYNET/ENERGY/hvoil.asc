                            Piping High Voltage in Oil

       Have you ever  wondered  how cables carrying many thousands of volts
       are snaked safely through a big city?   High  lines, such as used in
       the open country,  are out of the question.  The high-voltage  lines
       must go underground.

       This problem confronted  Consolidated  Edison  engineers  when  they
       recently decided to link up major New York City powerhouses and sub-
       stations with 138,000 volt tie lines.   They  solved  it  by running
       their "hot" cables through underground steel pipes  filled  with oil
       at a pressure of 200 pounds per square inch.

       The high-pressure of oil not only increases the insulating qualities
       of the many layers of oil-impregnated paper encasing the cables, but
       it also keeps  the  conductors  down  to  158  degrees F. even while
       carrying high loads.

       The system, pioneered by the Okonite-Callender  Co.,  of New Jersey,
       and in use on many miles of the nation's electrical  network as well
       as at TVA's  Wilson  and  Kentucky  Dams, not only eliminates costly
       underground conduit construction,   but  is  easily  maintained  and
       allows tremendous loads to be transmitted safely and  efficiently at
       high voltages.

           The high-voltage  conductors  used  in  conventional three-phase
           power system leave the powerhouse  encased  in steel pipe filled
           with oil under a pressure of 200 p.s.i.  The  oil  serves  as  a
           coolant as well as added electrical insulation.

           Automatic equipment,  consisting  of  pumps  and  oil reservoir,
           keeps the oil in the pipe under  constat  pressure regardless of
           expansion or contraction of conductors or pipe.

           To reduce possible damage caused by oil leaks,  pipe  is  sealed
           off where  splices  or  connections  are  made.   Oil for splice
           chamber by-passes through valve  system  that automatically cuts
           flow to it if a leak develops.

           Drawing at right shows how the oil system extends all the way to
           the big  porcelain  terminal insulators (utilities men call them
           "potheads"), also filled with oil under pressure.

           The three stranded conductors,  each  insulated  with  layers of
           oil-impregnated paper protected by a metal shield,  are  encased
           in an  oil-filled  steel  pipe protected by a special corrosion-
           resistant coating.

           Cable lengths up to 4,000 feet.
           Bolted or welded joints every 1,500 to 2,500 feet.
           Joints isolate terminal sections.
           Mechanical sleeves in place of sweated connectors.
           Porcelain high-tension terminals.

       Vangard Notes...

           The above article is interesting  especially for those who might
           be working on their own high voltage experiments  using Oudin or
           Tesla type  coils.   This also applies to electrostatics such as
           might be  used in T. T. Brown  or  Searle  type  propulsion/lift
           experiments.

           We have been looking into various ways to increase  the  current
           levels in  conjunction with high pressures.  Spark gap quenching
           through the use of pressurized  gas containers using nitrogen or
           any other inert gas offers intriguing possibilities.
