                            FREE ENERGY FROM MAGNETISM

       Most people believe  that  it  is  impossible  to  build a motor run
       solely by magnets.   But try to tell  that  to  people  like  Howard
       Johnson who spent six years fighting the patent office to accept the
       reality of his magnet motor.  They finally granted  him  U.S. Patent
       4,151,431. And there are dozens of other magnet motor patents.

       Engineers at Hitachi Magnetics Corporation have come right and told
       us that a  motor  run  by  magnets  is feasible and logical, but the
       politics of the  matter  make  it  impossible  for  them  to  pursue
       developing a magnet motor or any device that would compete with the
       energy cartels. The obstacles to free energy are the big banks who
       own the energy industries.

       Many achievements in  developing  free  energy from  magnetism  have
       occurred in obscure  basement  workshops all over the country.  Many
       of these achievements have remained  the secret of the inventor, who
       being afraid of reprisal from the establishment did  not  share this
       technology.

       The following information comes from Hitachi and other researchers:

           "The magnet that lifts a pound today, if the loan (on it)
            is  gradually increased day-by-day, will lift double the
            amount in time.  Whence comes this energy?  Keely teaches
            that it comes from sympathetic association with one of the
            triune currents of the polar stream, and that its energy
            increases as long as sympathetic flows last, which is
            through eternity."
                          from the book "Keely and His Discoveries"
                                           by Clara B. Moore, 1983

       In developing a theoretical basis for self-powered magnetic motors,
       it will be necessary to examine some of the elementary observations
       of magnets.

             1. Two permanent magnets can either attract or repel depending
                on the arrangement of the magnetic poles.



                                      Page 1





             2. Two  magnets  repel  further  than  they attract because of
                friction and inertia.

             3. Most of our energy comes  directly  or  indirectly from the
                electromagnetic energy of the sun, e.g., photosynthesis and
                water cycles of ocean to water vapor to rain/snow to ocean.

             4. Magnetic energy "travels" between the poles at the speed of
                light. (Some researchers claim it is faster.)

             5. Permanent  magnets and ferrous metals are attractive  only.
                Attraction is an inverse square force.

             6. Two  permanent  magnets on both sides of an iron shield are
                attracted to the shield  and  only  weakly to each other at
                close proximity to the shield.

             7. Magnetic energy can be shielded, e.g., by  placing  a piece
                of iron between the magnet and the object it is attracting.

             8. The  sliding  or perpendicular force of a keeper (e.g., the
                shield) is much less than the force in the direction of the
                field to remove the keeper.

             9. Most of the magnetic energy is concentrated at the poles of
                the magnet. You can prove  this  by sprinkling iron filings
                around a   magnet   and   seeing   where    the    greatest
                concentrations of  filings  fall.  This  will  give  you  a
                "picture" of the magnetic field.

            10. A permanent magnet loses  little strength unless dropped or
                heated.  Heating,  etc.,  misaligns  the magnetic  elements
                (domains) within a magnet.

           11. If   a  weight  lifted  by  a  permanent  magnet  is  slowly
               increased, the lifting (or pulling) power of the magnet will
               be increased up to the point  where all the magnetic domains
               in the magnet are aligned in the same direction.

           12. Using magnets for repelling tend to weaken them as it causes
               misalignment of the magnetic domains.

           13. A  magnetic  material  between two magnets  will  always  be
               attracted to the stronger magnet.

       By using some  of  the  above  magnetic  principles  in a mechanical
       arrangement, it is possible to "convert" the magnetic energy stored
       in permanent magnets into useable mechanical energy without the use
       of electrical energy,  i.e.,  direct   conversion  of  magnetism  to
       mechanical energy.

       According to modern magnetic theory a magnet motor would soon run
       down as the energy stored in the magnetic field would be used up
       driving the flywheel arrangement.  However, the only way a magnet is
       "used up" is  if  it  gets  demagnetized  by dropping,  heating,  or
       another magnetic field, or using an AC electrical demagnetizer.

       If the magnetic field of a magnet is actually part of the magnetic
       field of the earth, then there can be no depletion.

       Magnetic energy is not created. It is either stored in the permanent
       magnet or in  the  surrounding  space.   It  can  not  be used up or
       destroyed.

       Many magnetic materials are available.  Knowledge and careful
       analysis is needed to make the right choice.

       Only when there is a change in the balance of internal energies is
       energy released or absorbed by the permanent magnet.

       In addition to design parameters, physical characteristics and
       environment must be carefully considered in the application of
       permanent magnets.

       In development of properties, in design analysis, and in quality
       control of a particular permanent magnet, component-measurements are
       vital.

       Changing the state  of  magnetization  is  an  important  factor  in
       working with todays high coercive force permanent magnet materials.

       It could be  that  the  Hubbard Generating System has  already  made
       magnet motors obsolete.  Whatever the case, it is  obvious that free
       energy will be   developed   by   individual   effort  since  it  is
       painstakingly clear that neither big business or big government will
       act in the best interests of the citizenry.
