  In looking at  the  presumed design of the Sweet VTA, (presumed as a result
  of the lack of detailed information  available)  I  have  coined  the  term
  "alternate depletion" to describe its method of attaining ZP energy.

  We know from  conventional  transformer  theory  that  a  transformer  will
  reverse the phase  of the primary signal in the secondary winding.  This is
  caused by the inverse relationship  of  EMF  and  CEMF  in  the core of the
  transformer.  Typically, the core is made of iron laminates,  or some other
  ferrous material.  The Sweet VTA uses this principle in a manner which uses
  the phase reversal to cause a cascase of energies.

  The dual caduceus  coils  are  seen  as  next  to each other, which permits
  inductive coupling, and within the field of opposing magnetic fields, which
  creates a stress within the cores of the  caduceus coils.  At the crossover
  points of each coil, the flux collapse is "assisted" by the stress field of
  the core.  The stress field, similar to a conventional electric  generator,
  oscillates the lattice  structure  of  the copper wire, causing movement of
  electrons.

  Energy "stored" in the stress field is added to the energy of the original
  flux collapse, because it is "pushed"  in  by  the  opposing  energy of the
  other caduceus coil.  That is the effect of reversed phasing, as mentioned
  earlier.  While one crossover field is collapsing, the  corresponding  coil
  is expanding, which  adds  more  stress  field  energy  than that which was
  originally "displaced".

  This continues to occur at each crossover point.  The displacement caused
  by the "push"  results in am imbalance in the stress field.  As the process
  reverses, and the alternate coil's field  collapses,  it  is  aided  by the
  "push" from the expanding field of the first coil.  The current  induced in
  the second coil  is greater than the current in the first coil, because the
  "push" of the first coil is composed  of  its  original  energy,  plus  the
  "push" of the first coil.

  This continues to increase the energy at each crossover point, yielding far
  greater energy at the output of the coils than that which was used to begin
  the process.  The  energy is amplified through each winding  in  a  cascade
  effect.

  Core saturation, normally  undesirable  in a power transformer, is required
  in the Sweet VTA design.  The power attained  will depend upon the strength
  of the cores.   Power  will  increase until the core is saturated,  and  no
  longer able to expand energy into the magnetic field.

  Why does the field collapse at each winding?  This is at the heart of every
  caduceus coil.  When  wires  are  laid  over  each  other, a capacitance is
  formed, and the capacitance cancels the  inductance  of the windings before
  the crossover point.  This causes field collapse into the  core,  and  then
  into the next winding.
                                     Page 1





  A Tesla coil  uses the same principle, in that a frequency is applied which
  is resonant at the value of LC, causing  the series impedance to consist of
  wire resistance only.

  From this, we can see that the current which is used to excite a caduceus
  coil must also be resonant relative to the length of the windings and the
  amount of crossover capacitance.  To determine the appropriate frequency,
  the volume of the core as well as a resonating chamber must also be taken
  into account.  The core is essentially a resonant cavity,  and  you need to
  apply a frequency which will cause it to resonate.

  Think of the  core  as a hollow cylinder, to which you will apply a musical
  note until it resonates.  The core density  is irrelevant to resonance, and
  applies only when considering saturation.  Try using an ordinary "tin can",
  opened on one end, and apply acoustic energy until you reach resonance, and
  hear the energy "ringing" back at you.

  Having determined the resonant frequency of the core, then add the windings
  as if they were the holes in a flute, with a crossover at  each "hole".  In
  other words, even spacing is not going to work.  Each crossover needs to be
  preceded by a  length  of  wire  which  is  calculated  based  upon the PHI
  relationship to resonance.

  The caduceus coil has to attain aggregate  resonance  before it can produce
  an over-unity effect, so each of the seven crossovers is  a  whole  note on
  the diatonic scale.  In other words, use alternate cube and square roots of
  PHI (1.618) times  the  length  of  the  previous  winding to determine the
  length of the next winding.

  In this way, every winding is both a note  as well as a harmonic of another
  winding.

  Both coils of the Sweet VTA must be wound identically, placed side by side,
  and centered in  the  magnetic  stress field.  The primary  for  each  coil
  should apply a  low  level  signal  at  the  resonant  frequency,  and  the
  primaries should be 180 degrees out of  phase with each other to aid in the
  expansion and collapse of the flux fields.

  Much has been speculated about the necessity of "tuning" the magnets, using
  variuos methods which have been known to cause the magnets  to  explode.  I
  don't think that  this  is  relevant  to  the  design.  The stress field is
  merely reactive to the electromagnetic  energy  of the coils.  However, the
  size of the magnets and their strength is important.

  The size is  necessary so as to keep the flux fields contained  within  the
  stress field, and  the  strength  is  a  factor of the power which is to be
  derived from the coils.

  Think of the magnetically created stress  field  as  if  it  were  a guitar
  string, first plucked,  and  then  tightened to the next  higher  note.   A
  strong enough "string"  will  be  able  to "play" the entire octave without
  "snapping".

  Given these design parameters, the alternate  depletion  mode  can  be more
  easily visualized.  The primary coil applies the first note at the resonant
  frequency of the core.  This is picked up by the tuned windings  as primary
  and harmonic frequencies.

  The flux field expands into the alternate coil as well as into the stress

                                     Page 2





  field.  The phase  reversal  of  the  second  coil "pushes" energy from the
  stress field into the core and windings  of  the  first  coil,  whose  flux
  collapse "pulls" out  the  field  of  the alternate coil  as  it  is  being
  energized by its primary.

  Each cycle of primary current will increase the potential of energy at the
  outputs of the  coils.  As one caduceus "inhales" the other "exhales", with
  the addition of stress field energy from the opposing magnetic fields.

  This will only  happen  at resonance,  which  follows  strict  mathematical
  rules.  The input  signal  at  the  primary  must be kept  small  to  avoid
  overdriving the VTA,  which  if  the core density and magnetic strength are
  adequate, will cause the circuit to lose dimensional stability.

  Gravity IS time  IN  OUR universe, and  as  the  VTA  energies  cancel  the
  quadrupole effects of  particle  spin energy in the electromagnetic  field,
  the VTA will begin to lose relative "weight".

  It becomes caught in its own "warp field", and will start to rise.  Further
  power applied at  the  primary  may cause the VTA to "leave" our subjective
  temporal reality, and seem to disappear.

  Although it is "lost", it continues to  create  temporal  distortions which
  are detrimental to  the  dimensional  stability  and   therefore   to   the
  biological health of persons who are within the distortion field.

  With only a  rudimentary understanding of the principles of electricity and
  music, virtually anyone can create a  "time  machine" or "anti-g" device in
  this manner, but the costs can be high if the machine loses stability.  The
  universe, for its immense and vast amounts of matter and  energy,  is  in a
  delicate balanced state.

  One VTA lost in hyperspace can set up a chain reaction of events which will
  cause the vortical  "waves  of creation" to become unbalanced, resulting in
  the destruction of  a  galaxy.   Locally,   we  would  begin  to  see  this
  manifesting itself in  polar  instability, as the magnetic  energy  of  the
  earth itself begins to "feed" the VTA.

  To avoid creating  this  chain  reaction of events, the primary signal must
  NOT be a function of secondary output  power.  The amplitude of the primary
  excitation current must be fixed in such a manner as to  avoid  overdriving
  the VTA.
