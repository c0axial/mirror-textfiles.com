HUBBARD'S CLAIMS

If young Hubbard's claims are correct regarding the newest coil he has
perfected, and which propelled a boat yesterday, these are a few of the things
the coil would do without cost other than the initial outlay of $90:

    Drive a large touring car at normal speed.
    Illuminate a moderate-sized office building.
    Furnish current for lighting, cooking, and heating for a large residence
    Heat seven two room apartments.
___________________

Alfred M. Hubbard, Seattle boy inventor of a device which for want of a better
name he terms an atmospheric power generator, yesterday made good his
prediction that he would drive a motorboat with the apparatus as a source of
power.

An eighteen foot boat, propelled by a thirty-five-horse power electric motor,
which obtained its current from the Hubbard coil, was driven about Portage Bay
on Lake Union.  Among those who witnessed the demonstration was a well-known
local capitalist, the inventor's father,William H. Hubbard, and a Post
Intelligencer reporter.

The boat traveled at a speed of between eight and ten knots--silently, except
for the whirring of a chain belt which connected the motor with the propeller
shaft.  When the chain belt was removed, the motor ran free at a speed
estimated at 3,500 revolutions [the rest of this line is unreadable R.L.R.]

No Hidden Wires Found.

To guard against the possibility of ordinary storage batteries concealed about
the boat as a power source, instead of the Hubbard coil, both electric motor
and coil were lifted free from their blocks, but no hidden wiring was
revealed.  The coil used as a power unit was eleven inches in diameter and
fourteen inches in length.  According to Hubbard, tests of the coil show a
current of 280 amperes and 125 volts, which, he pointed out was equivalent to
approximately forty-five horse power, or sufficient to drive an automobile.
The current is pulsating.

The electric motor was approximately twelve inches in diameter eighteen inches
in length.  It had been reconstructed in order to be used with the Hubbard
coil.

After his ride in the strange powered craft the capitalist declared that he
was frankly puzzled, but that he desired an electrical engineer in his employ
to make an examination of the coil before he felt free to discuss it.

Since last December, when the Post-Intelligencer first made public the claims
of the youthful inventor, he has been more or less in retirement, perfecting
his coil.  He took up his residence in Everett where, with the assistance of
Everett backers he worked on his device.

A local capitalist agreed to witness a demonstration of the coil to determine
its practicability as a power source.  The motorboat was fitted with blocks on
which to rest the motor and the propeller shaft geared for a chained belt.

When the motor was first tried out after its installation in the boat it ran
backwards.  So involved are the connections between the motor and the coil
that fully a half-hour's experimentation was necessary before the motor shaft
revolved in the right direction.

That the capitalist was frankly skeptical of the device was plain when he,
with two other passengers, boarded the boat at the Seattle Yacht Club wharf.

All the machinery that was visible was the coil and the motor, the latter
plainly geared to the propeller shaft.  The boat shoved off, Hubbard threw the
switch, and instantly the boat began to pick up speed.

It circled about the bay and returned to the wharf, with never a slackening of
speed.  The wires connecting coil and motor had begun to heat under the
excessive current, and, fearing that some part of the coil might give way
under the extra heavy strain put on it, Hubbard declined to permit the motor
to be run continuously for any length of time.  It was tried out later several
times, after brief periods which allowed the wires to cool, and its power
apparently showed no diminution.  No instruments were used to test its
wattage.

The capitalist admitted that the demonstration intrigued his interest, but
that he would wait for his expert's opinion before discussing it.

Following the demonstration, the young inventor declared that within a few
days he expected to drive an automobile with the coil as a power unit.

The Coil used yesterday had been built especially for the demonstration, and
is nearly twice the size of the coil Hubbard used in his demonstration last
winter.  The large coil cost approximately $90 to construct.  The inventor
says that so far as he has been able to learn its life as a power unit is
indefinite.  He declared that a coil large enough to drive an airplane would
be no more than three times the size of the coil used yesterday, and that a
machine thus equipped could fly around the world without stopping, so far as
the power supply is concerned.

While the device has been patented, the claims for it are so broad that
Hubbard says he does not feel safe in making public his secret.  In general,
he says, it is made up of a group of eight electro-magnets, each with primary
and secondary windings of copper wire, which are arranged around a large steel
core.  The core likewise has a single winding.

A coil thus constructed, he says, is lifeless until given an initial impulse.
This is done by connecting the ends of its windings for a fraction of a second
to an ordinary [two words unreadable R.L.R.] -ing circuit, he says.

The manner of this momentary charging, however, constitutes the principal
secret of the device, according to the inventor, who says that while
machinists have built a number of coils for him under his direction, they have
been unable to "start" them.  In the event the power of the coil should
diminish, it can be rejuvenated in less than a second, Hubbard says.

Taken from the Vanguard Sciences Roundtable newsletter (VSRTOCT.95);

On another note, got a call from Mark Hendershott last night, son of Lester
Hendershott.  A couple of months before the Tesla conference, someone posted a
note on KeelyNet email saying they heard Mark on a local radio interview where
he claimed to have duplicated his fathers' device and would be demonstrating
it at the 1995 International Tesla Society conference.  A later call from Don
Smith down in Houston indicated Mark could not make the ITS, so Don had been
called as a backup speaker.

Mark says he never realized there was so much interest in his fathers work and
has only begun to study what all has been written, some of which is in error.

One particular point was that the Borderlands book on Hendershott specifies 24
turns on the top coil, when in fact, it should be two coils of 12 turns.  If
you will recall, the Hendershott device used a basketweave coil as is found on
early 1900 radio receivers.

Ed Skilling promoted the use of these basketweave coils in Hendershott
circuits several years back but he has kind of gone away after being captured
on a hidden camera at a New York health conference, making the outright claim
that he could CURE cancer.  Having met Ed on several occasions, I personally
think he is an excellent electronics man and has worked with both Bob Beck and
Jerry Friedenstine in the field of advanced radionics.

When Puharich's Teslar watches were the rage, Ed figured out a circuit that
would measure the 7.8 cycles per second emitted by these watches.  The idea
was the earth's atmospheric cavity resonated at 7.8 cps and that we are
isolated from such earth frequencies by living in a synthetic environment.

The watches have an oscillator that is tuned to the 7.8 cps and broadcast this
frequency as a scalar field through an internal Faraday cage.  Since the
Faraday cage suppresses electromagnetic energies, you could not get a signal
from the watches that could be measured.  Not to mention that electronic
devices have a very hard time getting a sample at such very low frequencies.

So, Ed had developed a box with a plate on it and and LED display that
constantly changed.  When you put your watch on the plate, it would detect the
scalar signal and display the frequency on the readout.  I was impressed with
the unit and Ed and I began discussing it.  He was very proud of it for two
reasons, first that the circuit could sense not only the 'scalar' signal but
also derive the frequency.

Skilling's technique was quite novel and took advantage of a circuit known as
a PLL (phase locked loop) in its multiplier mode.  An incoming frequency would
have positive and negative transitions that would remain relatively stable
over the length of the half cycle, no matter how long the wave.  So the PLL
was adjusted to pick up the zero crossing points (when the signal went from
negative to positive and back again) and multiply them by 200 to get a useable
frequency for CMOS or TTL circuits.  It was a marvelous and useful circuit.

(A few years later, when we had Puharich in Dallas, some of us techies were
discussing other ways this signal could be detected.....a fellow calling
himself Golden Hawk said he had placed a PENNY on the watch face and hooked an
oscilloscope probe to the penny, the signal came through loud and clear!  We
believe their might be some kind of capacitive field (the pure electric wave)
which was intercepted by the coin in close proximity to the antenna, maybe
even a feedback/reflection from the coin to the Faraday cage...anyway, it was
neat, simple and clean and needs to be shared.)

Back to Hendershott, Mark says he has a book that he sells for $29.95 and
might soon have a video showing how to construct the coils.  Once he realized
there was such an interest, he began contacting all the relatives and
soliciting pieces of his fathers work, papers, components, memorabilia, so
that it would not be lost through dispersion.  This happens more than enough
to researchers who die and fail to donate their materials to a stable group
who will do something useful with them besides landfill.  The Franklin
Institute is one such institution and the ITS is also trying to achieve that
kind of stability.

We desparately need some kind of perpetual, non-profit oriented organization
not only to serve as an archive, but also to promote and educate alternative
thought and experiments in science.  That is what the Vanguard Sciences
Research Center is all about, but not many people can see the bigger picture,
especially philanthropist/investors, with all its implications, so to date, we
have no solid leads on funding.

If you might be interested in learning what is available with the Hendershott
coil, you can contact Mark directly at his home.  He also needs advice and
counsel on how best to get some kind of income to fund his own experiments
with his fathers circuit designs.  Although he has several files which he
found of interest, we will be sending him other information which directly
correlates with his fathers work.  Tell him KeelyNet sent you....
