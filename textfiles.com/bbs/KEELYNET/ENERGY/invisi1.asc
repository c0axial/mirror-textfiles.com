            Flying Saucers  on  the  Attack  by  Harold T. Wilkins in 1954,

                              Invisibility Achieved??

       As one has noted, in both London and NY, attempts have been made, as
       in the 30's, to produce invisibility  by  warping  light  rays in an
       electromagnetic field.

       In 1934 in London, there was demonstrated in a public hall apparatus
       which was perhaps suggested by the fantasy of the late  H.G.  Wells'
       "The Invisible Man."

       A young scientist  wearing  what  he  called an Electro-Helmet and a
       special Mantle went  into a cabinet  open  at  the  front  before  a
       brilliantly lit stage  and  with both hands touched  contact  gloves
       which were over his head.

       An electric current  was  switched  on  and the man's body gradually
       vanished from feet to head!

       One could step up and touch him but could not see him.

       Nor did the camera reveal the secret  for  it depicted only what the
       eye saw.

       The inventor refused to reveal his secret which he said was the work
       of many years of experiments.

       All one could  see was the development of a cone of  light  such  as
       might be projected between the two poles of a powerful transmitter.

       This cone persisted even when the man could not be seen.

       The inventor had  succeeded  in  doing  on  stage  in  public what a
       dematerializing apparition is alleged to do in a haunted house.

       Whether he developed the powers of some new or previously discovered
       ray and created an opaque screen I am unable to say.

       Vangard Notes >>>

            As many  of  us  recognize,  this  smacks  of  the Philadelphia
            Experiment which used a fluctuating  magnetic  field  to  cause
            either invisibility or teleportation.

            There is some phenomenon definitely related to  extremely  high
            density magnetic fields which causes space and time to warp.

            The fluctuation  of  the  field seems to resonantly couple with
            the influenced mass to cause it to lose its "grip" in our space
            and/or time.  If not at one  or  more  of  the mass resonances,
            then some   "fabric  resonance"  which  causes   a   distortion
            regardless of the mass resonances.

            One of our papers on gravity gives a circuit which might relate
            to this anecdote.  I believe the file is GRAVITY6.ASC or .ZIP.

            In addition,  the  papers  BIELEK1  and PHILAD1 might be of use
            since they   cover  the  Philadelphia   Experiment   and   some
            interesting comments by Al Bielek on some kind of time lock.
