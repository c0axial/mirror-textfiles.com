               Energy Saving Invention being Suppressed by Snafu
                                by Scott Burns

While the Carter administration promotes its plan to turn a mountain of new
taxes into a molehill of energy savings, the real solution to the energy
crisis  -  new  technology  - may be languishing at our beloved Energy
Research and Development Administration.

Testifying before the Senate Sub-Committe on Energy Research and Development
on April 4, Vincent Carman, inventor of the Inertial Storage Transmission,
recounted a mind-boggling tale of resistance and delay at ERDA, the agency
charged with solving the energy crisis.

Here, in brief, is what he said :

  "Over six months ago, the National Bureau of Standards completed an
   extensive evaluation of a revolutionary automobile transmission that they
   reported could reduce our nation's oil imports by 50 percent.  This system
   can reduce vehicular air pollution in our cities by 75 percent.

   This OPERATIONAL SYSTEM was publicly demonstrated 18 months ago.  The
   system is simple, uses OFF-THE-SHELF, commercially available components.

   In the two years that ERDA has been aware of the system they have given the
   concept no serious attention."

It now appears they are attempting to suppress it.

Unlike Dr. Ilok's solution to the energy crisis (reported here April 17-20),
Carman's invention EXISTS, has been publicly demonstrated, and requires NO
research and development investment from ERDA.

Carman merely wants ERDA to get OUT OF THE WAY and make it possible for him to
install his invention on some U.S. Post Office trucks so that he might further
demonstrate its utility and potential for energy savings.

But ERDA won't get out of the way.  Instead, Carman says they have suppressed
the National Bureau of Standards evaluation of his invention, refusing to
release it to other agencies.

They've done this because the NBS report recommends Carman's invention for
funding, a singular achievement since only 22 of some 4300 submissions have
enjoyed positive recommendation from NBS.

ERDA's own, one-and-a-half page report, issued later, rejects the invention,
saying that it is too expensive, won't achieve the savings the inventor had
DEMONSTRATED AND DOCUMENTED, and won't be accepted by the automobile industry.

ERDA is circulating its own report and has not, to date, released the NBS
report, damaging both Carman's credibility and his ability to attract the
interest of other government agencies or private industry.

What is the IST System?

Carman's Inertial Storage Transmission works by storing oil under high
pressure.

This means that all the power output from an engine can be used so that in
city driving where car engines idle much of the time, a car could run USING
the STORED POWER of its engine and the engine's power WOULD NEVER BE LOST IN
WASTEFUL IDLING.  (stored in the form of compressed oil)

As a consequence, the engine could be OFF 80 PERCENT OF THE TIME, REDUCING
POLLUTION by 75 PERCENT and FUEL CONSUMPTION by 50 PERCENT!

Estimates indicate the IST could save some 35 BILLION GALLONS A YEAR, cutting
our imported oil IN HALF.

Carman didn't hear from ERDA for six months after NBS's positive report was
issued and then only after ERDA was pressured by Mark Hatfield and Congressman
Robert Duncan.  Clearly, ERDA would like the matter to quietly disappear.

Now let's consider the quality of the two reports :

   ERDA's negative report was produced in 42 days BY ONE INDIVIDUAL WITHOUT
   BENEFIT OF ANY PHYSICAL TESTING.

   The uncirculated NBS report was based on 10 months of work and
   contributions from a variety of sources, many of them here in
   Massachusetts.

   The Department of Transportation Systems Center in Cambridge, contributed
   to the evaluation as did the Mechanical Engineering Department at the
   University of Massachusetts, the Boston Police Department, the MBTA and
   Yellow Cab Corporation.

   Nonetheless, ERDA continues to circulate its own report rather than the NBS
   report.

   One possible reason is that ERDA is committed to another technology, the
   flywheel energy storage system.   To date, they have spent some $200,000 on
   a feasibility study of such systems. The study determined it would take
   three years and 4.5 million to get a prototype on the road,

           something Carman ACHIEVED IN LESS THAN A YEAR WITH $4000.

   The Department of Transportation also has an interest in flywheel systems
   and has spent five years and $300,000 trying to convert a Ford Pinto into
   a flywheel storage car.  Together, the two agencies have a contract to
   supply flywheel vehicles to the city of New York.  (Birds of a feather?)

   Meanwhile, the Postal Service also reports it has contracts for flywheel
   vehicles and therefore can't put up funds for demonstration of the IST
   system.

   ERDA, in other words, has neatly closed out a competing technology because
   the agency is in a position to exercise MONOPOLISTIC CONTROL over the flow
   of both money and ideas in new energy technologies.

   In an eloquent close to his testimony before the Senate sub-committee,
   Carman said ;

   "The energy problem has a solution and it is quite probable that a large
    part of that solution can come from the little guy.

   Two men in an upstairs room gave us the telephone, and a couple of bicycle
   mechanics brought aviation to the world.  It is sometimes said that the day
   of the individual inventor is over, but nobody told Robert Goddard that,
   and he invented the ballistic missle in his backyard.

   In the last few years, while the greatest scientific organizations in both
   the United States and Russia struggled with the problem of generating
   electric power from fusion, a young man in California in his own lab
   produced the first major breakthrough."

   Now that we've seen Carter's energy plan, we know that Carter has chosen
   taxation, not technology, as the means of "solving" the energy crisis.

   The money we all start paying in federal gasoline taxes will soon help ERDA
   expand its research efforts, - WHILE IT IGNORES SOLUTIONS.

Vanguard note...

As you can see from the experience of Mr. Carman, all the big corporations and
government agencies, with their access to huge laboratories and technical
resources, quake in their shoes that some independent lone inventor will
discover in his garage what they COULD NOT DISCOVER WITH ALL THEIR RESOURCES.

How could they justify their existence and all their accumulated knowledge
without staying far in advance of what any single person or small, LESS
ENDOWED group could do?

What would their stockholders and bosses say?

With regard to Carman, I regret the article does not provide EXPLICIT
directions as to what he is doing beyond using the oil pressure.  From reading
the article, it appears the engine is shut down while in an idling condition,
if that's the case, there might be some reticence in turning off your engine
at every stop light and turning it back on when it is time to roll, even
though this would be an 'automatic' process as part of the system.

Keep at it folks...read, talk to others, EXPERIMENT, try your hunches....the
past shows that you DON'T NEED TO BE RICH or have tons of equipment to
experiment and achieve success.  And be sure to share it with as many people
as you can.  Don't worry about 'evaluation' or a stamp of approval, by god, if
it works as claimed, the market will determine its success.  Build it, sell it
to your friends, expand, build and sell more, use networks and get the thing
used in a practical sense.  Do what the Russians are doing with the very high
efficiency YUSMAR heat generations system.

At a recent conference on low level energy reactions, one of the Chief
Scientists for the DOE (Thomas Ward) was there.  Everyone complained that no
funding was available for research into 'transmutation' using low level
energies.

The ramifications include not just transmutation of one element to another,
but the conversion of radioactive elements into STABLE ELEMENTS WHICH HAS BEEN
DONE on a reliable basis.  Dr. Robert Monti of Canada can take a radioactive
element and over a 3 day period, convert it to a stable element with no trace
of radioactivity.  Nevertheless, doors are shut when proposals of this nature
are presented because the common 'belief' is it CAN'T BE DONE.

As in the Carman device, no funding was even considered for what had every
indication of being a WORKING TECHNOLOGY, not just investigation of an
anomaly, erratic unexplained phenomena or evaluation.  Almost 500 million each
year is funneled towards 'hot fusion' research WITH NO SUCCESS.  Yet NOT ONE
PENNY is spent for 'cold fusion' or overunity investigations because most
academia 'believes' cold fusion is a mistake, unproven or 'can't happen.'

So what can we do in our own small way to make some kind of advances?  Formal
science requires large sums of money to do experiments, but as Carman noted
above, many important inventions have been made by garage and table type
experimenters, not by large corporate groups.  Forget about large scale
devices, stick with table top demonstrations.

Wait until one of us or a small team comes up with practical, affordable and
publicly available free energy or antigravity technology.  Don't you think
that the logic will flow something like this :

If these guys discovered this with such limited resources,

                  WHAT COULD THEY DO IF PROPERLY SPONSORED???
                                                                >>>  Jerry
