                         SOFT PARTICLE PHYSICS EXPERIMENT
                                        by
                                 Richard L. Clark
                                 1 September, 1982

       Below, are two  experiments  that may be performed, at small cost in
       time and materials, to grasp Soft Particle Physics as a reality.

       The first experiment is simply a unity electrical transformer test.

       Obtain two nearly identical 60 Hz  hollow  wire  coils  (relay coils
       will work).  Make a square open frame transformer to mount the coils
       upon, as a standard primary and secondary winding arrangement.

       Plug the primary into a standard household wall outlet, then compare
       the power input and power output of the transformer.

       The input to output power ratio will be less than unity, due to eddy
       currents, hysterisis and   other   minor  transformer   losses,   as
       expected.

       Now make a   completely  enclosing  shield  of  copper  or  aluminum
       sheeting (non magnetic)  for  the  secondary  coil  winding  of  the
       transformer.  Place the shield over the secondary.

       You will observe an immediate, drastic reduction  in  the  output of
       secondary coil of  the  transformer.  You have Soft Particle STARVED
       the secondary of  the  transformer.    Remove  the  shield  and  the
       operation of the transformer return to normal conditions.

       Now let us   construct  a  different  passive  enclosure   for   the
       transformer, a Phi  ratio, pyramid shaped Reich Accumulator.  I will
       not digress into why the Phi ratio  is used, other than that it is a
       critical angle to passive Soft Particle structures such as pyramids.

       The outside face dimensions for a 6 inch base Phi  pyramid  has  two
       5.7 inch sides, and for a 12 inch base has two 11.4 inch sides.  You
       will need four  faces  and  a  square  base  for  each  lay  of  the
       Accumulator, proportioned to nest.

       Alternate enclosed pyramids of organic and metal material complete

       the Pyramid Reich  Accumulator.   Now measure the input power to the
       output power of the transformer.  The ratio of power in this mode of
       transformer operation is greater than the unity standard before.

       Can you now maintain that current Physics knows what it is talking
       about, even at this elementary level?

       Let us now advance to the Reich Cloudbuster  and  nuclear  radiation
       systems.  There are   several   independent   Cloudbuster    Weather
       Modification businesses in  operation  in  the  United  States.  The
       services of a Cloudbuster and a trained  operator can thus be openly
       obtained with little effort by the serious researcher.

       Obtain a nuclear radiation sample and expose it as  the target of an
       operating Cloudbuster.  Since  the  Cloudbuster  is a passive (sink)
       particle beam weapon functioning as  a Soft Particle Physics device,
       it will DEACTIVATE the nuclear radiation sample.

       The reason that the Cloudbuster deactivates the sample  (or reactor,
       or weapon) is  that  they  are  dependent  on Soft Particle electron
       concentrations to function as a nuclear radiation items.

       The Cloudbuster's drain   (sink)   action   greatly   reduces   this
       concentration of Soft Particle Electrons in the sample, thus
       deactivating it.

       Joseph Cater, author  of  "The Awesome Life Force",  states  that  a
       maximally efficient Cloudbuster  would have solid aluminum or copper
       barrel tubes to AID soft particle electron CONDUCTION.
