Hello Jerry!

Neal Hyatt brought over a video he recently acquired.  It shows John Searl
giving a lecture in England in the late '80s.  John is showing off the unusual
properties of his special 'free energy' magnets.  This is done by suspending
with thread an ordinary metal paper clip over the magnet.  The paper clip
takes on a very rapid spinning motion.

Since I had a rare earth cylinder magnet with a diameter of 0.5 inch and a
length of 0.5 inch, we likewise suspended a similar paper clip and were very
surprised to see it take on a RAPID SPINNING MOTION.

We opened the clip to prevent any induced current loops and still saw a lot
of action.  We made the clip straight, attached the thread with tape and still
saw lots of action.  We tried larger straight metal rods and there was NO
ACTION but the common metallic magnetic attraction.

The spin is directly related to the up and down motion of the suspended metal
piece and the direction of the spin is always the same regardless of the
magnetic pole.

We see no evidence of 'free energy' only a change in the form.  The phenomena
DOES NOT APPEAR WITH ANY OTHER TYPES OF MAGNETS.  We have not tried other
variables as we discovered the unusual action only yesterday.

Many thanks for the recent newsletters!  Hope to see you in Colorado Springs
this coming July.
                                                              Lee Trippett
