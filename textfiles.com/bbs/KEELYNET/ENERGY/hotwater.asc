Below is an article which appeared in the August 5th., 1994 edition of the
Dallas Morning News on cooling your house FREE!
.
                             CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS
               A WATER-HEATER ACCESSORY CAN HELP COOL YOUR HOUSE
                                  JAMES DULLY

Q: I have heard about a new super-efficient water-heater accessory that can
   cool and dehumidify my house for free.  How do these work and can I attach
   one to my existing water heater?
.
A: You are referring to a small add-on heat-pump water heater (HPWH).  The
   super-efficient ones can cut water-heating costs by 60 percent and save more
   than $200 per year.  As they heat the water, they produce up to 7,000 BTU
   per hour of FREE cooling.  Other models cool and dehumidify fresh outdoor
   air.
.
An add-on HPWH operates something like a small window air conditioner.  You can
locate it near your existing water heater or in another room. Some models mount
directly on top of the water heater to save floor space.
.
A HPWH draws heat from the surrounding air. Instead of exhausting this heat
outdoors and wasting it as an airconditioner does, it is used to heat water in
your existing water heater.  The electric heating element or gas burners in
your water heater seldom have to come on.
.
A small add-on HPWH is about 18 inches wide and can be located anywhere in your
home and plumbed to the water heater.  Locate it in a room that you want to
cool and dehumidify - a kitchen or laundry, for example.  Some models allow you
to duct the cool dry air to another room or to your central airconditioner
ducts.
.
It is easy to install an add-on HPWH.  Some do-it-yourself installation kits
include a special coaxial water fitting that replaces the tank drain valve.
This carries cold incoming water to the HPWH and hot water from it naturally
follows back into the tank through the same fitting with no pumps.
.
Complete integral HPWH/tank systems are also available.  Venting models draw
heat and humidity from incoming outdoor air.  This produces positive fresh and
cool ventilation while heating your water for free.
.
For people with allergies or in-door-pollutant sensitivity, it is a cost-
effective and efficient method of improving indoor air quality.
.
If you have central air, a hot-plate heat exchanger is effective for free hot
water.  The refrigerant lines from the air-conditioner unit run through a heat
exchanger plate under your existing water heater. Using no pumps or
electricity, it transfers heat to the water heater for free hot water.
.
For an inefficient old central air conditioner, installing a dehumidifying heat
pipe can reduce the muggy feeling inside your home without using more
electricity. This pre-cools the air over the coils so more moisture is
condensed out.  It is a simple add-on device with no wiring or motors.
.
Write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 781, which lists manufacturers of
small add-on and fresh air HPWHs, dehumidifying heat pipes and hot plates for
free cooling, dehumidfying and water heating.  Please send your request, a
self-addresssed envelope and $2 (cash or a check payable to James Dully) to

.
This seems to me to be a very good way to save a lot of money.  I HATE pumping
thousands of BTUs of heat into the outdoor air and then turn around and PAY TU
electric even more money to heat my water??!!
.
I have sent in my two dollars, and I will post notes on what I receive in a
later message.  >> Bert
