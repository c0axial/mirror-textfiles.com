                      THE FINAL SECRET OF FREE ENERGY - 1993

                                   T. E. Bearden
                                     A.D.A.S.
                                   P.O. Box 1472

       Foreword

       This paper contains the real secret  of  tapping  the  vacuum energy
       very simply, using   almost   any  source  of  potential   (battery,
       electrostatic generator a  la  the  Swiss  electrostatic device (the
       Testatika), elevated wire  w/250   V/m   in   the   earth/ionosphere
       potential, etc.).

       The objective is for the moderately technical reader  to  understand
       how to build  and  understand  not  only  a  single device, but also
       hundreds of different kinds of them.   While it is quite simple, the
       "magic principle" contained in this paper only took me some 30 years
       to discover.

       The precise definitions  necessary  to understand  the  free  energy
       rationale are included.   Also  included are some very simple pseudo
       equations for the process.  Do not underestimate these simple pseudo
       equations __ they tell the tale that's needed.

       Also, there has been little or no time to "dress up" the paper. It's
       simply written down very informally,  to  get  the  necessary points
       across.

       Nearly everything fundamental that we've been taught about EM energy
       is wrong or incomplete.  Even the definition of energy in physics is
       wrong!  Let me summarize a few of the things that are wrong with the
       classical electromagnetics (CEM) model as follows:

       CEM is still utilizing a model based on a material  ether.  Although
       the Michelson-Morley experiment   destroyed   the   material   ether
       assumption in 1887, the classical EM model has never been corrected.
       It also contains  no definition of  charge,  and  no  definition  of
       potential.  In many cases, algorithms to calculate  a  magnitude are
       baldfacedly and erroneously advanced as "definitions."

       CEM still prescribes  the  force  fields  as  the  causes  of all EM
       phenomena; it has been known since  1959 that forces are effects and
       not causes, that EM force fields exist only in and  on  the  charged
       particles of mass  in  the  physical system, and that the potentials
       are the primary causes of EM phenomena.


                                      Page 2





       The lack of definitive definitions of mass and force in mechanics is
       carried over into  EM  theory; there is no adequate definition of EM
       force or of EM mass.  The magnitude  of  the electrical charge on an
       electron is not  quantized.   Instead,  it is discretized,  being  a
       function of the  magnitude of the virtual photon flux (VPF) exchange
       between the vacuum and the charged particle.

       When the charged particle is placed in a potential that differs from
       ambient, then the magnitude of the VPF __ and hence the magnitude of
       the electric charge  on  the  electron   __  is  altered.   The  CEM
       assumption of an  "empty  vacuum"  is  totally falsified  by  modern
       quantum mechanics.

       The CEM notion  that  EM force fields and force field waves exist in
       vacuum is totally false.  Only potentials  and  potential  gradients
       exist in the vacuum.  EM waves in vacuum are not forcefield waves as
       CEM prescribes; instead,  they  are oscillations of  potentials  and
       potential gradients.

       Potentials have a  bidirectional  EM  wave-pair structure, where the
       bidirectional wave pairs are phaselocked  in  a harmonic series.  In
       each wave pair,  photons  and  antiphotons are continually  coupling
       (into spin-2 gravitons)  and  decoupling.  This is where gravitation
       and electromagnetics are unified.

       The CEM notion that singular EM forces exist in either matter or the
       vacuum is false; Newton's third law  requires  that all forces exist
       in oppositive pairs.  Not a single one of the equations  universally
       taught as "Maxwell's  equations"  ever appeared in any book or paper
       by James Clerk  Maxwell;  instead,   they   are  Oliver  Heaviside's
       equations.

       Maxwell's actual theory  was  written  in quaternions,  which  is  a
       complete system of mathematics.  The Heaviside/Gibbs vector version

           (1) has a lower topology,
           (2) is not a complete system of mathematics, and
           (3) actually captured only a subset of Maxwell's actual theory.

       Tensor theory does  not  recapture  that  which was lost.  There are
       even more errors in CEM, but these should suffice to make the point:
       Classical electromagnetics theory  is seriously flawed, with archaic
       foundations, riddled with  errors,  and  it  should   be  completely
       redone.

       Until this revamping  of  CEM  is  accomplished,  the  present model
       solidly blocks free energy, antigravity,  a  unified  physical field
       theory, and a unified theory of mind and matter interaction.

       A second paper  this year will detail the exact long-term  causative
       mechanism for cancer  and  leukemia,  and  the  exact  mechanism for
       essentially 100% cure  of terminal  tumors  in  laboratory  animals,
       demonstrated by the  Priore  team in France in the  late  1960s  and
       early 1970s.  The same mechanism can be used to cure AIDS.

       Throughout the world,   humankind   is   suffering.    In  the  poor
       populations of the world, early death  is  the  norm, as is frequent
       famine.  One third of the human race goes to bed hungry  each night.
       Protein starvation of children is common.  One third of the human

       race is infected   with  worms.   Many  other  diseases  ravage  the
       farflung poor peoples  of  the  world.    They  have  little  or  no
       industries.  They have  no  abundant  electrical power.   They  have
       little education, and little modern knowledge.  They have little
       or no medical treatment.  In short, they are born without hope; live
       in misery, filth, disease, and poverty, and die without dignity.

       Meanwhile, the factories, cities, and enclaves of the "developed and
       developing" worlds belch  forth  fumes,  toxic and hazardous wastes,
       and pollutants.  They also spew forth  weaponry which for one reason
       or another is used to arm the poorer nations, for use  in destroying
       themselves and their   impoverished   neighbors.   Warfare,  terror,
       banditry, despotism, and all the four horsemen of the Apocolypse are
       truly loosed in the earth.

       We simply must do better than that.  And we can do better than that!
       But to do  better,  we've  got  to  make  the  basics  available  to
       impoverished nations, cheaply and easily.  Primary among their needs
       are energy and medical treatment.  Given those, populations  can  be
       stabilized, people educated,   development  begun,  and  the  living
       standard drastically elevated.  So that is the immediate goal.

       In this paper, I am freely giving  away  what required me an arduous
       30 years of my life to discover.  Shortly we will  also  detail  the
       new methodology for a new therapeutic science, hopefully to cure the
       diseases that ravage humanity.

       God willing, this  paper  will  trigger  a  thousand,  or  even  ten
       thousand, scientists and  engineers   to  develop  overunity  energy
       devices.  If so,  shortly  we  can  rid  our  biosphere  of  noxious
       automobile and factory  exhausts,  radioactive  nuclear  wastes, and
       massive oil spills.

       We can remove many of the hydrocarbon combustion pollutants from the
       air, stop acid rain and the destruction of our forests, and stop the
       steady rise of carbon monoxide in  our  air.   If  that  truly tends
       toward a "Greenhouse" effect, then we can halt that effect as well.

       The Creator has  always  given us bountiful free electrical  energy,
       everywhere, easily and  readily  for the simple taking.  It has only
       been our own blindness and folly that  have prevented us from seeing
       and using this free energy bounty.

       So here is the final secret of abundant, free electrical energy.

       Please use the knowledge well and see that its benefits  also accrue
       to those impoverished ones who need it so desperately.  Remember the
       adage, "Inasmuch as  you have done it to these little ones..."  This
       is for those little ones.  You are  our  brothers  and  sisters.  We
       want you to live.  And we want you to have a better quality of life,
       not just bare existence.  We care.

                          THE FINAL SECRET OF FREE ENERGY

                                T. E. Bearden 1993

       Some Definitions

       The Quantum Mechanical  Vacuum:  First we need some definitions.  We
       start by assuming   the   quantum   mechanical   vacuum.(1)    Empty
       "spacetime" is filled  with an incredibly intense  flux  of  virtual
       particles.  It is   a   plenum,  not  an  emptiness.   We  shall  be
       interested only in the fantastic flux of virtual photons, for we are
       discussing electromagnetics.

       Energy and Potential:  Energy is  any  ordering,  either  static  or
       dynamic, in the virtual particle flux of vacuum.  EM  energy  is any
       ordering, either static or dynamic, in the virtual photon flux (VPF)
       of vacuum.  That  is,  for  a  particular kind of "field" energy, we
       simply choose the so-called quantum  particle  of  that  field,  and
       consider only that kind of virtual particle flux.

       Potential is any ordering, either static or dynamic,  in the virtual
       particle flux of vacuum.  Hey! That's exactly the same definition as
       energy.  Quite correct.   Energy  and  potential are identically the
       same.  Neither is presently defined correctly in physics.

       Energy is normally defined as "Energy  is  the capacity to do work."
       That's totally false.  Energy has the capacity to do  work,  because
       work is correctly   defined   as   the   dissipation   (disordering;
       scattering) of energy (order).

       The scattering of energy is work.   It  is not energy!  I.e., energy
       is not definable as its own scattering!

       Look at it this way: A man has the capacity to catch  fish.  That is
       true, but it  is  not  a definition, since a definition must in some
       sense be an identity.  You cannot  say that a man is the capacity to
       catch fish!  That may be a submitted definition, all  right,  but it
       is false.  Similarly,  energy  has  the capacity to do work; that is
       one of its attributes.  But energy  IS  the  ordering in the VPF (we
       are referring from now on primarily only to EM).

       Scalar and Vector Potentials:  The scalar potential  is  any  static
       (with respect to  the  external  observer)  ordering  in  the VPF of
       vacuum.  The vector potential is  any  dynamic  (with respect to the
       external observer) ordering  in  the  VPF of vacuum.   We  shall  be
       interested in the electrostatic scalar potential.  So it is a static
       ordering __ a stationary template __ in the VPF of vacuum, much as a
       whirlpool is a  stationary  ordering (template, form) in the rushing
       flow of a river.

       The Scalar Potential Has An Internal Structure

       The Structure of the Scalar Potential:  According to rigorous proofs
       by Whittaker(2) and  Ziolkowski,(3)  any  scalar  potential  can  be
       mathematically decomposed into  a harmonic series  of  bidirectional
       wave pairs.  [Figure   1]   shows   this  Whittaker/Ziolkowski  (WZ)
       structure.  In each pair, the forward-time  wave  is  going  in  one
       direction, and its phase conjugate (time-reversed)  replica  wave is
       going in the other.

                                      Page 5





       According to the   so-called  distortion  correction  theorem(4)  of
       nonlinear phase conjugate  optics,  this  PCR  wave  must  precisely
       superpose spatially with  its  partner wave in the  pair.   The  two
       waves are in-phase spatially, but 180 degrees out of phase in time.

       The wave is  made of photons, and the antiwave (PCR wave) is made of
       antiphotons.  It follows that, as  wave  and  antiwave  pass through
       each other, the photons and antiphotons are coupling  and uncoupling
       with each other,  because  the antiphoton is a PCR photon, and PCR's
       precisely superpose spatially with their partner.

       A photon or antiphoton has wave characteristics,  because  it  has a
       frequency; if the wave aspects are perfectly ordered  and  perfectly
       correlated, then so are the photon's particle aspects.

       A Potential Is  An  Ordering  Across  the  Universe:   So we have __
       astoundingly __ perfect  VPF  inner   ordering   infolded   in   the
       electrostatic scalar potential!  We also have perfect  wave/antiwave
       ordering infolded in there.

       When you collect  a  simple  set  of charges on a small ball or in a
       region, the scalar EM potential from  that  set  of  charges reaches
       across the universe.  In it you have an infinite harmonic  series of
       phase-locked time-forward EM waves going out from the charges to all
       distant points of  the  entire  universe.   And you have an infinite
       harmonic series of phase-locked time-reversed  EM  waves coming from
       all points of the universe, back to the "collected charges" source.

       A Potential Is  A  River  of  Energy:   The  point   is,   you  have
       established a mighty,  hidden,  2-way  river  of energy between that
       collection of charges and every other  point in the universe.  There
       is infinite energy in each of those infolded waves and antiwaves.

       But in a  localized  region,  the energy density  in  each  wave  is
       finite.  Since in  finite  circuits  the  potential interacts with a
       localized set of mass, we shall be  concerned  with the local energy
       density (joules/coulomb) of the potential.

       But forget the  conventional  myth of visualizing the  potential  as
       pushing a unit  charge in from infinity "against the force field" __
       there isn't any  force field in the  vacuum,  as  is  well-known  in
       quantum mechanics.  Also, Newton's third law requires  all forces to
       occur in pairs  __  each  pair consisting of a force and its 3rd law
       reaction force.

       From that viewpoint  alone,  there   is  no  such  thing  as  an  EM
       forcefield or forcefield  wave  in  the  vacuum.    There  are  just
       gradients of the  vacuum  potential  present  in the vacuum.  In the
       vacuum, an EM wave is actually a wave  of the phase locked gradients
       of the electrostatic  scalar  potential  and  of  the  magnetostatic
       scalar potential.  And  each  such  gradient  wave is simultaneously
       accompanied by its  phase  conjugate   gradient   wave,  because  of
       Newton's third law.

       Newton's third law requires forces to occur in pairs  of  equal  but
       antiparallel forces.

       Both wave and  antiwave  co-exist  simultaneously  in  the vacuum EM
       wave.(5)  Therefore it's a stress potential wave, not a force field

                                      Page 6





       wave.  It's more like an electromagnetic sound wave,(6) and so it is
       a longitudinal wave, not a transverse wave.

       In the EM  vacuum  wave's  interaction  with  matter  (the so-called
       "photon" interaction), the wave-half  normally  interacts  with  the
       electron shells of  the atom, giving translation forces,  while  the
       anti-wave half interacts with the atomic nucleus, giving the
       Newtonian 3rd law  reaction (recoil) forces (waves).  The EM wave in
       vacuum is an electrogravitational wave.

       Energy Is Internally Infinite and  Unlimited:  A static potential __
       which is identically  excess  energy  __ is internally  dynamic  and
       infinite.  Energy is  internally infinite and unlimited!  But it has
       a finite energy density in a local region of space time.

       Since energy interacts with matter  locally,  we  shall be concerned
       with the local energy density (joules per coulomb).

       A Principle of  Great  Importance:   The only way  you  can  have  a
       "chunk" or finite amount of energy to dissipate in a circuit as work
       is to first  have a potential's local energy density interact with a
       local finite mass collector.  The  normal interacting mass collector
       is the free electrons (the free electron gas) in the circuit.

       You can have,  e.g.,  (joules/coulomb  x  coulomb);  (joules/gram  x
       grams); (joules/m3 x m3); etc.

       Voltage, Force, Potential  Gradients,  Loads,  and  Work:  Now let's
       look at circuitry aspects.  Conventionally they are a mess.  Voltage
       is "essentially" defined  as the  "drop  in  potential."   In  other
       words, it's the  dissipation (disordering) of a "finite  amount"  of
       potential gradient.  But  the only way you can get a "finite amount"
       of infinite energy/potential gradient  is  by  first interacting the
       potential gradient's internal, finite, excess energy  density with a
       finite "collector" mass.    E.g.,   (joules/coulomb   available  for
       collection) x (coulombs collecting) = excess joules collected on the
       interacting coulombs, available for dissipation.

       So voltage is  really the dissipation  of  a  finite  collection  of
       excess EM energy/potential gradient.  The dissipation  of  potential
       or of its  gradient  is  not potential!  You cannot logically define
       either potential or energy as it's own dissipation!

       We presently use  the  notion  of   "voltage"   in   two  completely
       contradictory ways in electrical physics.  Here's  how  we  got  the
       confusion:  We take  a  potential gradient (which has a local energy
       density), and we  "collect"  it across  some  charged  masses  in  a
       locality __ usually the free electrons in the free  electron  gas in
       our circuitry.  That is, we express the finite energy density of the
       potential gradient (before  collection  onto  charges)  in the local
       region in terms of energy per coulomb.

       The potential gradient  actually   is   a   change  to  the  ambient
       potential, and so  it  contains  an  excess  energy   density   (the
       magnitude may be either positive or negative).  We then collect this
       potential (actually this  potential  density) on a certain number of
       coulombs, which places tiny little  gradients  of  potential  across
       (coupled to) each free electron.  The local excess energy density of
       the potential gradient multiplied by the amount of collecting mass

                                      Page 7





       gives the amount of excess energy collected (on the interacting
       charges/coulombs).

       On each collecting particle, that little gradient, together with the
       coupling particle, constitutes a tiny force.  F is not just equal to
       ma (non relativistic  case);  instead,  F  =  (ma),  where  (mass  x
       acceleration) is considered as a  unitary,  inseparable  thing.   So
       that little potentialized  electron  (that little  EM  force)  moves
       itself around the  circuit.   In  the  load  (scatterer), the little
       potentialized electron (the little  force) is subjected to jerks and
       accelerations, thus radiating energy (shucking its gradient).  Since
       this is done  in all directions in the scatterer (load),  that  gets
       rid of the  gradient,  reducing  the  "little  force" (potentialized
       electron) to zero because the little  potential gradient is lost due
       to radiation.

       Collecting And Dissipating Energy

       Energy Dissipation and Collection:  Without further ado, we consider
       the scalar potential's local energy density in terms  of  joules per
       coulomb.  That is,  in  a  specific glob of charges (i.e., in finite
       circuits), the amount of energy collected  from a potential gradient
       onto the finite number of charges receiving/collecting  it, is equal
       to the number  of  joules  of  energy  per  coulomb  that  is in the
       potential gradient, times  the   number   of   coulombs   collecting
       (receiving) the potential gradient.  The current  is  the  activated
       (potentialized) coulombs per  second  that dissipate their potential
       gradients during that second.  The  current  multiplied  by the time
       the current flows gives the activated coulombs that dissipated their
       activation (potentialization) during  that flow time.   Dissipating,
       activated coulombs multiplied  by  the  excess  energy collected per
       activated coulomb gives  the  energy   dissipated   (the   work   or
       scattering done) in the load.

       We define collection  as the connection of a potential  gradient  (a
       source) to the  charged  masses in a circuit element (the element is
       called the collector), which for a  finite delay time does not allow
       its potentialized free electrons to move as current.

       In the collector, during this delay time these trapped electrons are
       "activated" by potential gradients being coupled to them.

       Technically, that delay time in the collector is known as relaxation
       time,(7) in the case of the free electron gas(8) (in  a wire or in a
       circuit element).  A  collector then is a circuit element that has a
       usable, finite relaxation time.

       During that relaxation time, the trapped electrons are potentialized
       without movement as current; each collecting/receiving free electron
       gets a little gradient across it, but no current yet flows. In other
       words, during this  finite relaxation  time  (collection  time),  we
       extract potential from the source, but no current.

       Thus we extract energy (potential), but no power (which is voltage x
       amperage).  During the relaxation time, we extract  from  the source
       only a flow  of  VPF, which is continually replaced in the source by
       the vacuum's violent  VPF  exchange  with  the  source's  bipolarity
       charges.


                                      Page 8





       We do not  extract  power  from the battery/source during relaxation
       time, but we extract free energy density.  That free energy density,
       coupling with a finite quantity of  electrons,  gives us a collected
       finite amount of energy.  With that background, let's  start  again,
       and go through this in a useful "free energy" manner.

       The Electron Gas.   We  refer  to the conventional model of the free
       electron gas in  a wire.(9)  Although  the  electrons  in  this  gas
       actually move by quantum mechanical laws and not by  classical laws,
       we shall simply be dealing with the "on the average" case.

       So we will  speak of the electrons and their movement in a classical
       sense, rather than a quantum mechanical  sense, as this will suffice
       very well for our purposes.

       When one connects a circuit to a source of potential  gradient (say,
       to a battery), the first thing that happens nearly instantly is that
       the potential gradient  races  onto the coupling wire and heads down
       it at almost the speed of light.   As  it  goes  onto the wire, this
       gradient "couples" to the free electrons in the free electron gas.

       However, inside the wire these electrons can hardly  move  down  the
       wire at all;  they  can  only  "slip"  once  in  a while, yielding a
       "drift" velocity of a fraction of  a  cm/sec.(10)   On  the surface,
       things are just a little bit different.  Most of the  "current" in a
       wire, as is  well-known,  moves  along  the  surface,  giving us the
       "skin" effect.  [For that reason,  many cables are stranded of finer
       wires, to provide  more  skin surface per cm3 of copper,  and  hence
       more current-carrying capability per cm3 of copper.]

       So initially little gradients of potential appear on and across each
       free electron, with  a  single little electrostatic scalar potential
       [V0] appearing on each electron, and  coupled to it.  The couplet of
       V0 x Me, where Me is the mass of the electron, constitutes  a  small
       deltaEe.  [This is  rigorous;  the  conventional EM notion that an E
       field exists in the vacuum is absurd,  and  it  is  well-known in QM
       that no observable  force  field exists in the vacuum.   As  Feynman
       pointed out, only  the  potential  for the force field exists in the
       vacuum,(11) not the force field as such.  Or as Lindsay and Margenau
       pointed out in their Foundations  of  Physics,  one does not have an
       observable force except when observable mass is present.12].

       We have stated it even stronger:

            Not only  is  F  = ma, but F =- ma (nonrelativistic  case).(13)
            (the term =- in the paper is actually 3 stacked parallel lines)
            Since no observable mass exists in vacuum, then no observable F
            exists there either.

       Force, Coupled Gradients, and Electron Translation

       Electrons Coupled to  a  Potential  Gradient  Move  Themselves.  The
       point is, when  activated  by a "coupled  potential  gradient,"  the
       activated electron moves itself until it loses its  activation  (its
       coupled potential gradient).

       Let me say that again, in a little more detail.  Forget the standard
       notion that a force field such as the E-field causes electrons to


                                      Page 9





       move.  Also forget  the  notion that the E-field is given by E = -V0
       (where 0 is the electrostatic scalar potential).

       In foundations of physics, those equations are known to be incorrect
       for the vacuum.   EM  force fields  are  known  (in  QM  foundations
       theory) to be  effects,  existing  only  in  and  on   the   charged
       particles, and not  existing separately at all,(14) or in the vacuum
       at all.(15)  Instead of E = -V0, in  the vacuum the correct equation
       would be something like this:  PE = -V0.

       In this case,  we have correctly stated that the potential  gradient
       PE provides the  potential  for producing an antiparallel E-field in
       and on a coupling/collecting charged  mass,  and  the  magnitude and
       direction of that potential gradient will be given  by  -V0,  if and
       only if a  charged  mass  particle  is  first  introduced so that it
       couples to PE.

       At any rate, the activated/potentialized electron moves itself.  The
       reason is that  it  constitutes   a   force.    Force   =-  (mass  x
       acceleration) (non relativistic case) (again, the  symbol  =-  is  3
       stacked parallel bars).   So the potentialized/activated electron is
       continuously accelerating.  However,  it  is  prevented  from easily
       moving down the wire directly.  To begin to do that,  it essentially
       has to first move to the outer skin of the copper conductor.

       The Collector:  We  now  consider a circuit element that we called a
       collector.  (It could be a special  coil made of special material, a
       capacitor with doped plates rather than simple conducting plates, or
       any one of a number of things).

       The objective is for the collector to be made of special material so
       that it has a free electron gas whose electrons are  momentarily not
       free to move  as  current  (they  continue  to move violently around
       microscopically, but essentially    with    zero   net   macroscopic
       translation) for a finite delay (relaxation) time,  while  they  are
       settling themselves upon  the  surface  and  preparing  to  move  as
       current.

       Let's call the electrons NNTE (no  net translation electrons) during
       that finite delay (relaxation time).  During that "no-current" delay
       time, the NNTE  electrons  become  potentialized/activated   by  the
       potential gradient impressed across the collector.  So at the end of
       the NNT time,  the  NNTE electrons are potentialized, and each is of
       the form [V0 x Me].

       The Secret of Free Energy

       Two Circuits/Two Cycles:  We are going  to  use two circuits and two
       cycles, as shown in [Figure 2]:

            (1)   We  shall  connect  a  collector to a primary  source  of
                  potential (to  a  battery)  during  the  short  time that
                  current does not yet flow, but potential does.  (In other
                  words, during the relaxation  time  of  the collector, we
                  allow the  VPF  to  flow onto the NNTE electrons  of  the
                  collector and  potentialize  (activate)  them, but do not
                  yet allow the electrons  themselves  to  flow as current,
                  but only   to  move  transversely  in  the   wiring   and
                  collector.)

                                      Page 10





                  This is   cycle   one  of  a  2-cycle  process:  This  is
                  collection of a specific amount of current-free potential
                  gradient __ power-free energy __ off the potential-source
                  (the battery) onto a collector.   During  the  collection
                  cycle/time, current does not and must  not  flow  (we are
                  discussing the ideal case).  We are freely " charging up"
                  the collector as a secondary battery/source.

            (2)   At   the   end  of  the  collection  (potentialization  /
                  activation) time/cycle  in circuit one, the potentialized
                  collector (the  charged  secondary  source)   is  sharply
                  switched away   from   its   connection  to  the  primary
                  potential source (the battery),  and  at the same time it
                  is instantly switched into a separate closed circuit with
                  the load.    This  is  important:  In  cycle   two,   the
                  potentialized collector (with its finite amount of excess
                  trapped EM  energy)  and  the  load  are  connected  in a
                  completely separate circuit, and one that is closed, with
                  no connection at all to  the original source of potential
                  (in this case, to the battery).  Specifically, this "load
                  and potentialized   collector"  circuit   is   completely
                  separate from the primary source; during cycle two the
                  primary source   (the   battery)   is  not  connected  to
                  anything.

       In other words,  all  we've  taken  from  the  primary  source  (the
       battery) is current-free, force-field-free potential  gradient.   So
       to speak, we've  taken  a  "chunk  of  potential  gradient" from the
       source, nothing else.  You simply  multiply the potential gradient's
       local energy density  (the  so-called  "voltage",  which  is  really
       excess joules per  coulomb) by the number of coulombs of charge that
       is "activated" (that   "collects"    this    voltage    or    excess
       joules/coulomb) in the collector.

       Specifically, we have not taken any power from the  battery  itself,
       and so we  have  not  done any internal work inside the battery upon
       its internal resistance, by a "closed  circuit  electron  flow" back
       into the battery.  We have not permitted such a flow.

       Instead, we are  using  the  activated  collector  as  a  temporary,
       secondary battery.  We  will  utilize  this  secondary  battery in a
       conventional manner to power the  load,  which  will  also  kill the
       secondary battery (dissipate its trapped EM energy).   But that will
       not affect the  primary source.  The primary source is never used to
       directly power the load.  It is only  used  as an infinite source of
       potential gradient (i.e., as an infinite source of energy density).

       The Standard Power Extraction Circuit

       The Conventional Circuit:  We digress momentarily:   In the standard
       electrical method, the  potential  source (which is a bipolarity) is
       connected across the load.  This connects both the external load and
       the internal resistance of the battery  itself  in  series,  as  the
       "total circuit load."  Electrons then pour through the external load
       circuit and through  the  internal  battery  resistance,   from  the
       "electron rich" polarity  of  the  source  to  its  "electron  poor"
       opposite polarity.

       The scattering of energy in the internal battery resistance is

                                      Page 11





       actually doing work  to  upset the chemistry that is maintaining the
       battery's charge separation (the  bipolarity).   In  this manner the
       source's separation of charges (which is the "gate"  furnishing  the
       potential/energy gradient) is  being destroyed as the current flows,
       and this in turn destroys the source of the potential gradient.

       In other words,  normally  we engineers  are  trained  to  kill  the
       bipolarity, which kills the potential source itself!   Incredible as
       it may be,  we engineers and scientists have been trained to utilize
       the free "trapped EM energy" furnished by nature through the source,
       to destroy the source of the energy/potential,  with  the same vigor
       as we power  the  external  load!  In fact, our teachers  themselves
       simply have never  learned  any  other  way  to  do  it  except this
       deliberately "self-destructive" manner!

       A Waterwheel Analogy

       Imagine, if you will, a waterwheel that powers a mill, with a sluice
       gate upstream in a river, that diverts  some  river  water  into the
       sluice carrying water to the wheel when the sluice  gate  is  opened
       into the river.   The  diverted  water flows down to the waterwheel,
       turning it, and the spent water is fed back into the river below the
       millsite.

       Now what fool would connect a pulley  onto  the  waterwheel,  with a
       rope running from the pulley to the sluice gate,  so  that  when the
       wheel rotated, part  of  the  rotational  power also was utilized to
       close the sluice  gate  and  shut   off   the  water,  stopping  the
       waterwheel?  If one  did so, when the sluice gate  was  opened,  the
       waterwheel would rotate  only  until  the  sluice  gate  was closed,
       shutting off the water.  Then one  would  laboriously have to pay to
       reopen the sluice gate again, then again, then again.

       No self-respecting "waterwheel   engineer"   would    do   such   an
       unthinkable, insane thing.   But  that's  exactly what we engineers,
       electrical physicists, and scientists  have  been trained to do!  We
       have no energy engineers or energy scientists at  all;  instead,  we
       have all been  power  engineers  and  power scientists.  We have all
       been energy source killers!

       In this paper we shall try to do  better,  and  rectify  "one of the
       most remarkable and inexplicable aberrations of the  scientific mind
       which has ever  been  recorded  in  history,"  as  Tesla  called the
       conventional electromagnetics.16   By  being  energy  engineers,  we
       shall only have to pay for our energy source once, and then we shall
       draw as much energy from it as we wish.

       External Load Power Is Free; Only The Power In The Source Costs

       Here's the magic secret of free electrical power:   The power in the
       external load is  absolutely  free, and it always has been free.(17)
       In any load circuit the only power  you  have  to  pay for, and have
       ever had to pay for, is the power you incorrectly use  to  kill your
       own primary source.  The only power that "costs" more effort/dollars
       is the power  erroneously  utilized  inside the source to "close the
       gate" and kill the primary source.

       Your electric power company doesn't  pay  for  any  of the collected
       energy on your load circuits that is dissipated to power your house.

                                      Page 12





       Instead, the power  company  charges  you for its own ignorance.  It
       charges you for  its  insane  use   of   its  own  freely  extracted
       electrical energy to continually kill the bipolarity  in each of its
       generators, thus continually  killing  the free electrical source of
       that generator's energy.(18)

       In any electric circuit, we can continue  to  indefinitely power the
       external load indirectly from a source, so long as  we  are  not  so
       naive as to  use  any of the free energy we extract from the primary
       source to dissipate back inside the  primary  source itself and shut
       it off!

       And we can easily and freely multiply electrical potential.   As  an
       example, given a  single  good source of potential, a hundred radial
       wires can be connected to the source.   The  same potential will now
       appear at each of the ends of the hundred wires.

       A switcher/collector unit can then operate from each  radial  line's
       end, and power   external  loads,  without  "loading"  the  original
       primary source.  This "cascading"  can be continued indefinitely.  A
       single power plant,  e.g., can power the entire electrical  grid  of
       the United States.   And  a  single  automobile  battery can power a
       large, agile, electric automobile at highway speeds, with sports car
       acceleration, with unlimited range, without "refueling," and with no
       noxious chemical exhaust.

       Obvious Impacts

       Environmentalists should immediately see that the chemical pollution
       of the biosphere by mechanista and processes to obtain energy can be
       dramatically reduced, to almost negligible levels.  There need be no
       huge oil tanker spills, for there need be no huge oil tankers.

       There need be no worrisome radioactive  wastes  from  nuclear  power
       plants, or abandoned  hazardous nuclear plants when  their  life  is
       finished, because there need be no nuclear power plants.  There need
       be no noxious exhausts from jet air planes (which are really what is
       diminishing the ozone  layer and punching holes in it), automobiles,
       trucks, buses, innumerable coal-fired  and  oil-fired  power plants,
       etc.

       The Electronic Smog Problem

       In fairness we  point  out  that,  as  the usage of free  electrical
       energy mushrooms, we  will  be dramatically increasing the low-level
       EM signal density of the environment,  and  that too is biologically
       detrimental.  Although beyond   the  scope  of  this   paper,   that
       cumulative biological damage  mechanism  has  also been uncovered by
       this author.  A formal paper is  in  presently  in  preparation  for
       presentation in March 1993 at the annual meeting and  conference  of
       the Alabama Academy of Science.(19)

       The paper will  also  present  an entirely new definition of cancer,
       give its exact long-term cumulative  mechanism,  and  give an exact,
       scientifically proven mechanism  for  eliminating cancer,  leukemia,
       and other debilitating  diseases  such  as  AIDS.   For our purposes
       here, we simply state that we understand  the  EM  "electronic smog"
       biological damage mechanism, and how to go about developing  a total
       counter for it.  Eventually we would see a small "counter unit"

                                      Page 13





       added to each  power unit, alleviating the "electronic smog" problem
       and preventing biological damage.

       Only Dissipate Energy From a Collector, Not the Source

       Completion of the Collection Cycle:  But to return to the completion
       of our collection cycle (cycle one).  During collection, we have not
       extracted power from the source.  That is vital.   We have not moved
       the gate through which our source  is  furnishing  free  energy.  We
       have not diminished   our   primary  source.   From   our   previous
       definitions of potential,  we  have  indeed extracted trapped energy
       from the primary  source,  because   we  placed  its  "local  energy
       density" across a  certain  finite  collector/mass   ,   instead  of
       extracting power (dissipating energy inside the source or battery to
       spoil its chemistry and deplete its charge separation.).

       All Energy Is Free

       Here's the incredible  truth.   The  entire  universe is filled with
       mind boggling free energy everywhere, in the simplest of things.

       Simply scrape your feet on the carpet,  and you will collect perhaps
       2,000 "volts" on  your  body.   At that time, hidden  EM  energy  is
       flowing from every point in the universe to your body, and from your
       body back to  every  point  in  the  universe.   We  know  that  all
       macroscopic matter is filled with  stupendous  amounts of electrical
       charge.  So an  incredible  river of energy __ a great  flux  __  is
       driving every single thing, from the smallest to the largest.

       Opening a gate to extract trapped EM energy is simple.  Just collect
       a bit of  charge,  or  scrape  your  feet  hard,  or  comb your hair
       briskly.  All we have to do is not be stupid and close the gate once
       we've got it opened!

       God has been most kind.  We have nothing but free energy everywhere.
       All energy is furnished to us freely!   It's  our own blindness that
       has made us into energy source killers.  All we have  to  do is open
       our eyes to the truth of nature's incredible energy bounty.  We must
       just freely collect that bountiful fruit from Nature's tree, instead
       of chopping down the tree and killing it.

       Dissipating The Collected Energy

       The Work Cycle:   We  focus  again  on cycle two.  Shortly after the
       now-potentialized collector is   connected   to   the  load  at  the
       beginning of cycle 2 (the power cycle, or energy dissipation  cycle,
       or work cycle), the potential gradient across the potentialize
       d collector is  connected (transferred) across the free electrons in
       the load circuit.  We assume that  the material of the collector and
       the switching time  have  been  designed  so  that,   shortly  after
       switching to the  loading/work  cycle,  the  activated/potentialized
       free electrons in the electron gas  in  the collector reach the skin
       of the collector, and are free to move as current.

       So just after the beginning of cycle two, each of the free electrons
       in the load circuit now is potentialized and free to  move  down the
       wiring.  Each potentialized  (activated) electron has its own little
       individual potential gradient across  it  and  coupled to it, due to
       the overall potential gradient from the collector.  Remember, prior

                                      Page 14





       to coupling to  charges,  this  potential gradient moves through the
       circuit at light speed.

       An EM potential gradient coupled to a charged mass constitutes an EM
       force field (excess trapped EM energy  per coulomb, times the number
       of collecting coulombs).   Now  each little free electron  with  its
       potential gradient forms  a  little E-field (force/charge), and that
       little E-field (force/charge) is free  to move.  That's all it takes
       to move (accelerate)  the little activated electron's  mass  through
       the load (the scatterer).

       We strongly stress  that  the potentialized/activated electron moves
       itself.  It doesn't care whether  or  not  the  external  battery is
       attached or not.   It  is  its own little motorboat,  with  its  own
       little engine driving it.

       As the little   potentialized   electrons   reach   the   load  (the
       scatterer), they bang and clang around  in  there erratically.  That
       is, the "scatterer"    (load)    causes    spurious    accelerations
       ("scatterings") of these self-driven electrons.  As is well-known,
       when a charge  is  accelerated,  it radiates photons.  What actually
       happens is that these little "jerked  around"   electrons  shuck off
       their little potential gradients in the load (in the  scatterer,  or
       the "jerker-arounder") by    emitting/radiating   photons   in   all
       directions.  Hence the heat that is  produced  in the load; the heat
       is just these scattered photons.  The theory of calorimetry  already
       states that all  the  excess energy (on the potentialized electrons)
       will be dissipated as this heat (scattered EM energy).

       When all the  potentialized  electrons   have  radiated  away  their
       potential gradients in  the  load (scatterer), they  are  no  longer
       potentialized.  The free  electron  gas  is again "quiescent" and no
       longer potentialized/activated (again,  we are talking about "on the
       average" from a classical viewpoint.).

       Repetition and Review

       Notice What We've Done:  We took some trapped EM energy  density  (a
       chunk of potential  gradient, a "voltage" before current flows) from
       the source, by switching that potential  gradient  (energy  density,
       which is joules per coulomb) onto a collector (containing  a certain
       number of coulombs  of trapped charges) where the potential gradient
       activates/potentializes/couples-to these temporarily non translating
       electrons.

       So the finite collector collected  a  finite amount of excess energy
       [joules/coulomb x collecting (trapped) coulombs] on  its now-excited
       (activated) free electrons.   Then before any current has yet flowed
       from the source, we switched that  potentialized collector (with its
       temporarily restrained but  potentialized  electrons;   with   their
       finite amount of  excess trapped EM energy) away from the source and
       directly across the load.

       Shortly thereafter, the relaxation  time  in  the collector expires.
       The potentialized electrons in the collector are  freed  to  move in
       the external load circuit, consisting of the collector and the load,
       and so they  do  so.   The  scattering "shock collisions" due to the
       erratic electron accelerations in  the  load  shake  off  the little
       potential gradients on the conduction electrons, emitting photons in

                                      Page 15





       all directions, which  we  call  "heat." In shaking off the photons,
       the electrons lose  their little  potential  gradients,  hence  lose
       their activation (excess EM energy).

       Rigorously we have  extracted  some  energy  in  trapped  form,  and
       allowed it to  dissipate  in  the  load,  "powering  the load" for a
       finite discharge/dissipation time  and  doing work.(20)  Contrary to
       the conventional electrical  power engineering, we  have  also  done
       this without doing  any  work  inside  the  source  to  diminish its
       ability to furnish potential gradient.
