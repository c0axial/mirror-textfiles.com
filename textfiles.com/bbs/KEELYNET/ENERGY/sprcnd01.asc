and at what temperature may this tape supeconduct ?
dan

PS. I have read this announcement in the press myself and no mention was made
    of the temp range.

he, he! Are they really still working? I remember the gizmotron from my
schooldays. Most peoble didn't beleive in it, but I sure was popular by
the chicks - others guys new only of the "waterbed". tsk, tsk! :-)

But - really - you must all know, that if you place an aluminum sheet on top
of a powerfull electromagnet going several hundred hertz, the AL-sheet will
levitate. This is due to the electric current inducted in the metal. This will
work in any metal or salt-solution, with different results of course. So
shortly: It IS possible to levitate an electromagnet above seawater, but you'd
probably need a very powerful sine-generator. I haven't tried it yet, but I'm
working on the idea.

 actually, they use superconductors and magnets..

  Don't you think that engineers are stupid, please. These trains have wheels
  for the event of a mishap with magnets. It is wrong to create unfounded
  fears about technology, there're enough of them already.

I'm not sure if they really all have wheels. I think that the most advanced
german magnet train 'Transrapid' does not have wheels. In fact it will do an
emergency break by simply switching off the magnetic field and touching down
on the rails.

I've once seen this in a film about these trains: A huge cloud of smoke is
produced but the train breaks pretty efficiently down from >500 km/h to
zero.... I suspect that they have some airbag system to avoid pancaking the
passengers.

   Look in any recent CRC Handbook, there's a table of superconducting alloys
  and their properties. There may not be much about the high-Tc materials.

    Cool....It seems weird that you can make a superconducting alloy. (most of
    the high temp superconductors are compounds right?) Like the YBaCuO and
    that 125K superconductor.. Strontium Calcium Barium Copper oxide or
    something. Anyway, I have this 1"x1/8" YBCO disc ($15 mail order) and
    can do the meissner effect, but am trying to make it conduct electricity
    with no luck. I'm thinking maybe the thing is coated with something...
    It doesn't conduct electricity at room temperature at all. Nor at -200 C.
    Any ideas?

    Also, is it possible to put a seperate dewar in my 5L liquid nitrogen
    dewar to hold liquid helium? (has to be pretty small...maybe not worth it)
    The neck is only about 2"
