       The following papers  are  the  private  research and conclusions of
       Terry Bastian, who  like  many  of   you   desire  to  DISCOVER  and
       UNDERSTAND the world around us.

       Ether 1 & 2 GIF's do not have any text and are self explanatory.

       Ether 3 &   4   have  accompanying  text  file  descriptions.    The
       information here is  of  a basic nature but crucial to understand in
       the manipulation of Free NRG or ZPE  or  the Ether whatever you want
       to call the  source.   The  papers contain updated  terms  but  were
       originally written on paper in 1987.

       We as a  group  of  investigators  must  not say "Where are the real
       machine designs!" so much as we need  to  say  "How  do these things
       work and what are the physical laws behind them?"

       The computer wasn't   invented   when   people   discovered   static
       electricity by rubbing 2 dissimilar materials together.  Electricity
       had to be  understood  to an extent so we could apply it to make the
       computer.  And so goes this technology.   Yes  let's get the working
       models to the  public  but let's also strive to learn  what  we  are
       playing with so we can be creative and use it better.

       I am open  to  any  questions  and  criticisms about these and other
       papers that I have and will upload to KeelyNet......

       The Etheric/ZPE field flows around a magnet as shown, at a rate

                                      Page 1





       determined by the amount of magnetism present.

       As the Ether/ZPE  spirals  INTO  the  south  pole  its  spiral  rate
       INCREASES, as does the Etheric/ZPE density to a tremendous amount.

       When the energy flow EXITS the north  pole the spiral rate DECREASES
       as well as does the density, because the energy is being released or
       liberated from the  constraints of the dense material  substance  of
       the magnet.

       The atoms and  molecules of the magnet when properly aligned, form a
       conduit and an active ordered flow occurs in the Ether/ZPE and hence
       creates a magnetic field.

       Possibly the best and strongest magnet  could  be  made  by numerous
       parallel strings of  tightly  wound  continous  spiraling  molecular
       lattices', running from  North  to  South  poles,  the  tighter  the
       spiraling the greater the effect.   Spiraling  resonance  throughout
       the overall length could also be a factor.................

       The Ether\ZPE flows in the direction of current flow.   Being  drawn
       from the surrounding medium by electron movement the Ether\ZPE seems
       to funnel in  upon  the conductor, and by being drawn in, the medium
       rotates or spirals onto the conductor,  perhaps  by  the  electrons'
       spin.

       The areas of  equipotential pressure in the rotating  medium  around
       the conductor are  what  we  have come to know as the magnetic field
       about the conductor or equal lines  of  Etheric\ZPE  density.   This
       disturbance about the conductor expands at the rate  of the speed of
       light.


                                      Page 2





       The illustration shows  only  one  electron or unit of current flow,
       but expand the illustration to the  entire  length  of the conductor
       for the combined flow of all free electrons in the conductor.

       The depth of conduction in the conductor is a representation  of the
       Etheric\ZPE PENETRATION into the conductor which depends on the rate
       of change or  direction of flow, otherwise known as the frequency of
       the applied current.

       DC would have maximum penetration due to allowing the Ether\ZPE flow
       time to penetrate  through  the conductor,  when  the  frequency  is
       raised the flow meets the conductors' molecular structure and atomic
       forces and isn't  allowed  time  to  penetrate  the   substance,   a
       frequency can be  attained  where the Etheric\ZPE medium will bounce
       or careen from the boundary of the  conductors' surface allowing the
       escape of free electrons to the air as a corona discharge.

       We know this as the SKIN EFFECT.  High voltage and current produce a
       similar effect, due to the large voltage pressure or  large  current
       density within the conductor itself.

       Vangard note...

           The best work I have yet seen regarding magetic fields and their
           specific effects is that of Albert Roy Davis and Walter Rawls of
           Florida.  This is brought up because their concept  of north and
           south is  EXACTLY REVERSED from the normal way of thinking.  The
           explanation for WHY they chose this method of describing the N/S
           effects escapes me at the moment  but  needs to be looked up and
           placed into a useful file.

           Davis/Rawls found that North pole energies caused  a contraction
           of mass  that  was  also  associated with an alkaline condition.
           While South pole energies were  exactly  opposite, that is, mass
           expanded in  the  presence  of  this  force  and  tended  toward
           acidity.  One  of the interesting comments made in the Meier UFO
           case was that the ships used a  CCW  South pole force to provide
           lift.  Please take the .GIF files, they are very well done.
