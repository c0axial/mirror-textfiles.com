                        New Neon Transformer design
                      NeonLite Electronic Transformer

    To help in  the fabrication of various devices, particularly Tesla
    coil projects, we decided to list this information for our users.
    A switching converter for a Tesla coil driver, a idea long
    overdue and at such a great price.

    DiAnalog Systems, Inc. takes pleasure  in introducing NeonLite, an
    electronic transformer for  neon  lamps.   NeonLite  provides  low
    construction and installation   costs,  lightweight,  small  size,
    reliable solid-state circuitry,   energy  savings,  improved  life
    expectancy and low noise level.

    NeonLite use 40% less energy but provides the same light output as
    a convential transformer.

    NeonLite uses a switching converter operating at  20  KHZ which is
    beyond the normal hearing range.

    NeonLite is adjustable from 2000 up to 9000 volts depending on the
    maximum output of the selected model.

    NeonLite also has a 12 VDC input model which puts out a maximum of
    5000 Volts at 30 MA.

    NeonLite physical size  for  the  smallest 120 VAC driven model is
    6.3 X 3.8 X 2 inches with a maximum output of 4000 volts at 30 MA.

    NeonLite physical size for the largest 120 VAC driven model is 9 X
    3.2 X 1.9 inches with a maximum output of 9000 volts at 30 MA.

    Approximate cost for each unit dependent on size if $65.00.

           thanks to Mr. Ronnie McWilliams for this information.
