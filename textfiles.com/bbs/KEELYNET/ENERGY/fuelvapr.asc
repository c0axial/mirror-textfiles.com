                       Suppressed Mechanical Fuel Vaporiser
                                 by Peter Nielsen

       In response to the recent article on fuel vaporisation for increased
       performance and mileage.   It was told to me about fifteen years ago
       by an inventor  living  in  Phoenix,  Arizona.   In  the  course  of
       business, he visited  a  friend  who  happened to  be  doing  patent
       illustrations for a simple petrol-saving device.

       Several days later they met again and the following tale unravelled.
       The artwork was commissioned by a small machine shop on the outskirt
       of town.  When  the  draftsman tried to deliver the finished job, he
       found the factory stripped and deserted.

       Only the metal studs, which once anchored heavy equipment, were left
       protruding from the concrete floor.   A  neighbor  said  an unmarked
       semi-trailer had a  few  days earlier hauled everything  away.   The
       proprietor also disappeared without a trace.

       Out of curiosity,  the  orphaned  plans were then re-examined.  They
       showed a horizontal metal tube.   It  had  three  or  four  vertical
       partitions and closed  ends,  all  with  a  round  vent  near  their
       uppermost circumference.  A  shaft  mounted  on sealed ball bearings
       ran down the central axis, driven  at  high  speed  by  an  external
       pulley connected to the car's fan belt.

       To it were attached, in each compartment, a set of  radial  turbine-
       like blades.  A  tube led from one end of the cylinder direct to the
       vehicle's petrol supply or pump.   The  downstream  side went to the
       carburetor.  The unit could be switched in or out of  the  line by a
       solenoid valve activated from the dashboard.  Here's how it works.


                                      Page 1





       Upon starting the  car  and warming up, ordinary fuel was drawn.  At
       speed, the machine was placed online.

       The effect reported was a sharp acceleration - without ever touching
       the foot pedal.  Petrol entering  the  first  air-filled chamber was
       mechanically atomised by  the rotating wheel.  This  passed  through
       each successive compartment,  becoming  more  and  more  like a fine
       mist.

       Any condensed liquid fell to the bottom of each section, which acted
       as a sump, sucked up again into turbulence  by  the spinning blades.
       Only the most vaporous components from each chamber  passed  through
       the row of  top vents and on to the carburetor, resulting in cleaner
       and more EXPLOSIVE combustion.

       Adjustment of flow rate would be critical  to  prevent saturation of
       the impeller cavity.   With  improved  design,  the   device   could
       possibly function as  both  a  liquid  fuel  pump AND variable inlet
       chamber for admixture of air and/or water.

       So now you know what someone BADLY  didn't  want anyone to find out.
       No wonder they're worried.  Sounds like a nice weekend project to me
       - at your own risk, of course.  Seriously, this conversion is highly
       dangerous, maybe illegal,  and  to  be  attempted only  by  licensed
       automotive engineers.  The  above  info  is  offered for educational
       purposes only, and has not been substantiated by the author.

       PS : Years  later, my friend conducted  his  own  experiments  while
       working at Motorola.   He  once  injected an unknown  proportion  of
       petrol and water between two thinly spaced piezo-ceramic wafers.

       It is a  property  of  this  material (ceramic wafers) to vibrate at
       ultrasonic frequencies when electrical  power  is applied.  Circuits
       of suitable configuration  are  common  in  medical   scanners,  and
       industrial cleaning baths for small parts.  What emerged was a white
       viscous foam, a  surprisingly stable emulsion that ignited violently
       when lit.  Then  there is also the  story  about  how  he  tried  to
       'blackmail' razor blade companies with a herb from  the  Amazon that
       removes hair permanently.  Maybe later, folks.
