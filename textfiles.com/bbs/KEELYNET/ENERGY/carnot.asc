The following refers to a new heat to mechanical energy convertor which has
overunity properties that defy the Carnot thermodynamic cycle.

Well, I just received the latest news about the research done over here at the
Workshop for Decentral Energy Research in Berlin, Germany.

The physician, Mr. Bernhard Schaefer and his team of researchers, together
with the Russian inventor Serogodski have successfully patented their new
machine design, which works as a heat to mechanical energy converter.

It does not need a "cold pole", it just converts the surounding heat into
useful mechanical work.

It works via "retrograde condensation" and uses a gas-mixture of 2 working
mediums, N2 and C4H10.

The German patent office issued the patent number:

    42 44 016

Try to get it and read it. It is very interesting.

Bernhard Schaeffer has worked over a 30 year time period on these limits of
the 2nd thermodynamic sentence and finaly has won the battle.

With his latest measurements he now can prove, that with the retrograde
condensation with these gas-mixtures he can get efficiencies, which are far
higher, than Carnot would predict.

These measurements are done very precisely and it was invested a huge amount
of money and time to build all the technical equipment to measure the effect
at the right pressure and temperature.

This invention will change the world. Now endless "free energy" is possible to
use. You just pay for the machine and it will produce pollution free clean
electrical energy, just by converting the heat of the surrounding into
electrical energy. Just think about a refrigirator, which produces electrical
energy, instead of consuming it !

You will soon hear more about this fantastic invention ! The future of mankind
looks bright !

If you want to have more info on this whole subject, please write to the
company which finances all the work:

    Doekowa GmbH & Co KG
    attn: Dr. Hans Wilh. Colsman
    45241 Essen, Germany

They will send you an information paper of all the measurements and the future
plans.  If you are an investor, which wants to license the machine design to
build inside your country you are welcome to contact them as well.

So far my latest information. Sorry, they don't yet have email access, so you
have to write to them by snail mail.  I will keep you updated on all the
latest news about their machine design.

Regards, Stefan.
