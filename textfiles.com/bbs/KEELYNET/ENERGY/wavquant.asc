For the first time in Internet, a new unitary physical theory called:

                        The Waving Theory of the Field.

In this new unitary theory, changing the actual starting hypothesis on the
continuous space-time nature, we can imagine a discontinuous space-time, that
may become, the agent and, at same time, the background of physical phenomena.

In this modular space-time, organized like a discrete lattice, can occur
states of geometric perturbations of this discrete lattice that move along the
relativistic geodetics, identified by integral Lorentz transformations.

These perturbations are spherical waves' surfaces that move its own discrete
spherical surface's parts, in the discrete lattice, like bidimensional planes.

We make the hypothesis that the subatomic particles are the elementary sources
of these spherical waves that, in complex, constitute all fields ascribing to
the particles.

On this basis, we make a new physics that, starting from existence of a
discrete space-time, obeys to laws of a discrete space-time geometry, that
connect the microphysics to macrophysics.

Through it we comprehend and connect Quantum Mechanics at General Relativity,
and Mechanics at Cosmology in one global design.  On the same basis, we can
understand:   gravitational interactions,
              electromagnetic interactions
              and a new model for nuclear interactions.

We discover a waving model of elementary particles, adapt (it) to describe all
microphysics' phenomena, that, obeying one's symmetry' principle, leave out
the nigthmare of the singularity, allowing an understanding, mere causal, able
to justify all the passages, apparently indeterministic, inherited from
Quantum Mechanics.

This model, showing that the electrical interactions are absent in the space
of nuclear interactions (at distance of 1 Fermi), describes a new coherent
theoretical justification for experimental phenomena of the Cold Fusion,
describing at the same time the composition of a waving structurate model of
the particles' family and all its decays.

The new waving model of interactions produces a waving explication for the
bodies' inertia, conducing the Clein-Gordon formula to a complete physical
comprehension, and freeing Relativity from the assumption of identity between
inertial forces and gravitational forces, deriving a causal explication of a
new Waving Quantum Gravity.

It follows a generalization that conduces to a combination from gravity and an
antigravitational Fifth Waving Interaction, derived from the relativistic
limitation of the ligth velocity, that regulates the composition and behaviour
of macrobodies in the Universe.

We can draw a new way for the rationalization of the controversal astronomical
observations that interest the actions of the cosmological masses.

The Compton effect carries a waving explication, derived from an extending of
General Relativity, that interests the Quantum Mechanics and permits, to come
to a description of all interactions of micromechanics.

A natural extension of the same Compton effect drives to a waving electron's
model, and to all subatomic particles, placing a valid causal basis for the
waving explications of the Lorentz force, and producing a model of
electromagnetic interactions, that brings to a consequent perception of
meaning of the electric charge's nature.

We rediscover a coherent atom's model in which a causality chain, purely
waving, permits to follow the development, step by step, of the waving actions
on the photoelectric phenomena, revealing the really waving nature of the fine
structure constant, connected to a light emission's mechanism, merely causal.

The Waving Theory of the Field has been already published in Italy, from the
author Walter E. R. Cassani, in October 1984 on a book entitled:

                    Il Campo Unificato (The Unified Field),

distributed by the author to the IV National Congress of the General
Relativity and Physics of the Gravitation, in Florence (Italy).  No reaction
from the physicists and astrophysicists.

A next evolution was published in the same way in 1989 with title:

       La Teoria Ondulatoria del Campo (The Waving Teory of the Field).

(This is actually translated in english, and showed in Internet) No reaction
from the official university circuit.

A third book entitled:

                 Albert Aveva Ragione - Dio non gioca a dadi,

( Albert Was Rigth - God doesn't play dice ) is published in Milan in January
1994, and personally distributed from the author in 300 book-shops.  The first
edition (5000 copies) sold out.

Many entusiastic letters (were received) from students, chemists, engineers,
etc.  A first conference in the Aula Magna of the Physical Dep. of Bologna
University.

250 students, 1 Relativity Prof, 1 Dep. Chief.
3 hours of conference, full entusiasm from the rest 200 students.

No reactions from the physicists.
No reaction from the scientific journalists, in many ways requested.

Is (it possible to) here and now begin on the Internet a new international
scientific revolution, that involves physics foundations and assists in the
appearing of a new paradigma?

Perhaps Internet is born for this.

or, eventually, promove (disprove?) it.

It seems to me that the QM 'wave' (I'd have to agree with Frank Hollis that
calling QM a 'wave' is a matter of using macroscopic concepts to try to
describe something that doesn't quite fit into those concepts) is a wave 'in'
some kind of 'phase space' - after all, that's what is actually varying.

An archetypal QM wave looks like this:

   Psi(x) = cos( k x ) + i sin( k x )  (as usual, k = h_plank/momentum),

which has a constant probability over space ( Prob(x) = | Psi(x) |^2 = 1 ),
but which has a varying *complex phase* ; that is what the wave is "in".

Thus your question would seem to me to become this :

                    What exactly is this QM phase, anyway?

This is difficult because the phase has no counterpart in classical phsyics.
As I understand it, this phase was invented to explain interference patterns.

The mathematics works, and so we think of the QM phase as varying (waving)
from place to place as a particle moves around.  BUT, since only differences
in this complex phase are measurable, and then only if you're very clever in
setting up your experiment, it's hard to pin down exactly what this complex
phase "is" other than a new property of all mass/energy, a fundamentally non-
classical one.

This 'phase' takes on real physical significance, too.  Although I haven't
looked at the math recently, I think it's true, for example, that the
invariance of QM under a constant phase offset is related to the fact that
charge is conserved, just as systems which are invariant under spatial
translation must conserve momentum.

Finally, allow me to point out that this problem of the "medium" that the wave
is waving in is an old one, going back to a long running controversy about
light.  (Which is probably what J. Stein was referring to in his note saying
that there is no medium needed.) (We call it Aether.....KeelyNet/JWD)

Even within traditional classical physics, if you ask what light (which
certainly has many wave-like properties) is a wave "in", that is, what is the
medium which is waving, the modern classical answer is "it's a wave in the
electromagnetic field."

But of course that just begs the question of what exactly this "field" is.
You can only tell it's there by putting a charged particle somewhere to see if
it gets pulled, so what makes you think it's there if you don't?

These days that probably seems like a silly point, after all, the E-M field
carries energy, and momentum, and seems as "real" (at least to me) as anything
in physics is, but fundamentally it's the same kind of intangible that the QM
phase is.

After all, the "E-M field" doesn't behave at all like air or water or any of
those "intuitive" wave mediums - that's why special relativity came as such a
surprise.

Anyway, that's probably more than you wanted to hear.
