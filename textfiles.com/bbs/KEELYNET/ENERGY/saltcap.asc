Before I jump into salt water capacitors I would note that the rotary gap is
overkill on a neon power supply. The rotary may even cause a premature failure
in a neon. This is not to say the gap won't work, it will, I just prefer a
decent static gap when using internally limited (read neon) transformers...

Now, on to the subject at hand, salt water capacitors:

Tesla used salt water capacitors in the primary circuit of the industrial
sized Colorado Springs coil. He took ceramic standoff insulators and placed
them on wooden planking layed down over the wooden floor. On top of the
insulators he placed another layer of wooden planking. This formed an
insulated raised platform.

On top of the raised platform Tesla placed seven square metal tanks. The tanks
were made of tin or galvinized sheet steel and had soldered seams to prevent
leaks. Each tank was about three feet square and two feet high. An excellent
photo of these tanks appears on page 324 of the Colorado Springs Notes.

Inside of the tanks, Tesla placed a number of glass mineral water bottles.
Using a saturated solution of rock salt and water (brine), Tesla filled the
bottles about 2/3 of the way to the top and inserted an electrode into each
bottle so that the conductor was in contact with the brine.

Each electrode extended out of the top of the bottle. The bottles in each tank
were grouped into three equal parts or sections. Each group had their
electrodes wired together to form a high current buss.

Once the bottles in a tank were filled and connected, brine was carefully
poured into the tank until the level of salt water in the tank and the level
of salt water in the bottles were the same. This is a salt water capacitor.

The brine in the tank forms one of the two capacitor plates. The glass bottles
are the dielectric. The brine inside of the glass bottles forms the second
plate of the capacitor.

Tesla had some simple covers that fit over the tops of the tanks.  There were
three holes in each cover. A high voltage buss cable passed through a
porcelain insulator placed in each hole. Each cable represented 1/3 of the
capacitance of a tank.

Salt water capacitors of this type are messy to build, difficult to maintain,
and very lossy; but they do work. In order to supress corona losses, prevent
flashovers up and down the sides of the bottles, reduce churning of the liquid
plates during pulse operation, and prevent evaporation of the brine plates;
both the bottles and the tank were topped off with several inches of heavy
mineral oil.

For today's coiler a smaller and somewhat simpler salt water capacitor may be
easily and cheaply constructed for use until a suitable plastic film capacitor
can be constructed/purchased. The most common is the beer bottle/brine cap.

I have heard all of the jokes about these... That you don't really need the
brine, just get a case of cheap long-necks and let nature take it's course:-)

But anyway, you do need about a case of long neck bottles (clean with labels
removed) and beer bottles do work very well. You will also need the twist off
caps. Buy a standard Rubbermaid plastic dishpan (11-1/2 x 13-1/2 x 5-1/4
inches, Wal-Mart under $7.00).

Shop around at a hardware store(s) and buy twenty-four 1/4 inch diam. by 6
inch long galvinized steel carriage bolts. You will also need seventy-two, 1/4
inch thread, nuts that will thread onto the carriage bolts. You will need a
few quarts of the cheapest grade, straight 30W, non-detergent, motor oil;
don't spend money for multi-viscosity high detergent oil; you can use the best
mineral oil in a pinch, but it works no better than cheapest straight grade
engine oil.

You will need some heavy duty aluminum foil, and you may want to get a large
tube of clear silicone sealant. Get a 1/4 inch diam. by 1 inch long brass
screw and two nuts.

Using a hole punch, punch a 1/4 inch hole into the center of each twist-top
bottle cap. If you punch from the top of the cap down it will bend, so flip
the caps over and punch them through from the bottom. Run a nut down the
threaded shank of the carriage bolt about an inch, slide a bottle cap over the
threaded shank, then run another nut down and tighten.

This should produce an electrode that will drop down inside of the long neck
bottle and will secure with a twist on the bottle cap. After fitting and
adjusting, you may want to remove the top nut and the cap. By bedding the cap
to the electrode with silicone sealant you can prevent leaks and stop the nuts
from loosening.

After completing the electrode assemblies for all of the bottles, mix up a few
gallons of warm saturated brine in a five gallon plastic bucket. I use the
cheapest grade of rock-salt which is readily available here in the winter
season. In many parts of the country water softener salt is available year
around.

Fill each bottle with brine to a depth of about 4-3/4 inches, insert the
electrode part way, then top the bottle off with a couple of inches of motor
oil. Use a small funnel or "squirt bottle" here to prevent sloshing and do not
overfill with the brine or oil.

Now if things are going right you have a bottle with the electrode assembly
inside and held over to the side. Before fully inserting the electrode
assembly and cinching down on the cap you can smear some silicone sealant
around the threads on the cap and around the top of the bottle. This will
prevent leaks. Cinch down firmly on the cap.

Fold a very large sheet of aluminum foil over double and scrunch it down into
the bottom and sides of the plastic dishpan. Some dishpans have a hole molded
into the lip, if yours doesn't then cut or drill one. Get a 1/4 inch diam. by
1 inch long brass screw and two nuts. Roll up a bit of the foil at the hole
end of the dishpan, punch a hole through the foil, and make a terminal by
passing the brass screw through the plastic lip and foil. Secure with one nut.
The second nut is for securing the connection to the tank circuit.

Set the bottles into the dishpan. You will find that only 16 of the bottles
will comfortably fit, but you will most likely need the other eight bottles
and a second dishpan to get a .012 MFD capacitor. One dishpan with 16 bottles
gives about .008 MFD.

Wire the tops of the bottles together with some stout copper cable, strap, or
copper tubing that is pounded flat and drilled for the 1/4 inch carriage bolt
electrodes. You can use some strips of aluminum flashing with holes punched
through if you smear a little electrical corrosion inhibitor on the
connection.

When everything is set and settled down, fill the dishpan up with brine to
within a 1/2 inch or less of the rim. Pour a thin layer of oil over the brine
to suppress corona. With the dishpan this full it is not fair to say this
capacitor is portable. It will slosh over if moved. It is probably best to
fill the pan right where you intend to use it.

There are as many variations on these capacitors as there are coilers building
them. Heavy plastic bottles or buckets give a much higher Q factor, but the
dielectric constant ("K") of the plastic is a low ~2 compared to the much
higher K of bottle glass which comes in ~7. This means the capacitors must get
physically larger.

I have seen a pretty nice vertical stack brine capacitor made from five gallon
plastic buckets. A strip of stainless steel strap was hung across the bottom
of the bucket, up the side, and over the rim. About 1.5 quarts of brine was
poured in.

Another bucket was firmly seated inside of the first,  another strap, more
brine, another bucket, etc. The guy was processing 8 KVA from a pole pig
through this corona-glowing; ozone-producing monstrosity.

Like I said, these are messy, inefficent, high maintanence... but they are
very cheap and they do work.
