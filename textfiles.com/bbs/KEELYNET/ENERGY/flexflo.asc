The book money goes into furthering Mr. Wiseman's research which will result
in more info for US to use. Please purchase these books if you are interested
in studying this device. There is much more information contained in the books
that I don't plan to delve into in this extremely short text.

Mr. Wiseman explains his process of experimentation fully and also notes the
many strange effects of his devices. His ideas seem to FULLY explain the true
nature of electricity.

I am in no way affiliated with Mr. Wiseman or H & A Industries, but I do
HIGHLY recommend these books for your personal library.

The principle behind this circuit is simply this:

This circuit takes an initial charge from a power supply or battery (12vdc for
this circuit). That charge is recycled several times through a resistive load
(a bulb, for this demonstration).

The circuit produces the same mysterious "pulsating" lightbulb effect that the
"Sweet Vacuum Triode" and the "Testatika" produce through the bulbs that they
power in their respective videos.

These circuits are ONLY TWO POSSIBLE FORMS for this power recycling.  I would
like to encourage anyone who would be kind enough to make this into a solid-
state circuit that the capacitors could simply be "plugged into".

A MOSFET switching device using digital timing for duty-cycles and pulse
frequency would be a fantastic boon for further research using this little
toy.  This recycling can be accomplished at any voltage, as long as your
components can handle it. High Voltage arc contacts might be used instead
of solid state switches.

Well, now the rest is up to YOU. Get the books. Study the books. Let's get
this F/E boat rockin'!

Mr. Wiseman's books contain much more information than I an provide in this
short text. I highly recommend ordering and reading the "energy conserver"
books.

                                     from

                             the anonymous F/E guy

                              FLEXFLO2.GIF
                              FLEXWAT1.GIF

The first and most important principle of these circuits is the understanding
that a resistive 'Load' DOES NOT CONSUME electricity.

This is easily illustrated by examining ANY school text on electrical theory.
They always show several examples. I have emphasized a few points in these
examples to demonstrate my point.

  1. Electrons flow from a battery's negative pole, to a batteries positive
     pole. ALWAYS. Once the electrons (current) complete the circuit and
     enter the positive pole, some of the battery's potential is destroyed.
     The more current that flows, the faster the battery goes "dead".

  2. Electron flow (current) THROUGH a wire "causes" a magnetic field around
     that wire. The field strength is in direct proportion to the amount of
     current. The electrons don't DISAPPEAR in the wire. They go IN one end
     AND OUT the other.

  3. Electron flow THROUGH a bulb produces light and heat. The current does
     not DISAPPEAR inside the bulb. The same current flows on both sides of
     the filament. The current going into the bulb is the same as the current
     that leaves the other side of the bulb.

Nobody ever seems to notice the obvious contradiction between electricity
passing COMPLETELY THROUGH a load and electricity being CONSUMED WITHIN a
load. It has to be one or the other, not both.

Resistive loads only slow down the current, they don't consume it. If they
did, your battery would last longer on devices that consumed more electricity
because the electrons would vanish inside the load and never reach the
positive pole of the battery. In the real world a circuit works like this, one
electron goes in, one electron comes out. That's just the way it works.

The FLEXFLO circuits are designed to hold a volume of electricity and "pour"
it from one bank of capacitors to another bank through a load.  If the circuit
in FLEXFLO2.GIF is constructed using standard grade electrolytic capacitors,
it should move approximately 3 to 4 times as much electricity through the load
area than what is actually drawn from the battery. (based on actual circuit
measurements and calculations.)

  The Charge of a Capacitor is figured in coulombs:

                       Q=CE
            where:
                 Q = electric charge (coulombs)
                 C = capacitance (farads)
                 E = voltage (V)

  A coulomb is a measure of electrical VOLUME contained in a capacitor.

Using this formula with the capacitances and voltages in a circuit, we can
calculate approximately how much energy will move through that circuit.

See Flexflo2.gif in relation to the following example. Measurements taken from
an actual prototype in operation. Energy used for switching was on a separate
circuit and is not used in the calculations.

My prototype used four 110,000uF @ 25v capacitors, Four DPDT relays, one
microswitch to activate relays, one 13.6 volt car battery, and many bits of
colored wire.

C1 and C2 make Bank 1. C3 and C4 make Bank 2.

Step one:

  Battery was connected to bring charge across C1 to 13.6 volts. At this point
  C1 and C2 are in parallel while C3 and C4 are in series. Battery was then
  disconnected.

  Total capacitance of Bank 1 is .22 farads @ 13.6 V = 2.992 coulombs
                       Bank 2 is .055 farads @ 13.6V =  .748 coulombs
                     -------------------------------------------------
                                 Total system charge = 3.740 coulombs

Step two:

  C1,C2 placed in series. C3,C4 placed in parallel. This caused a VOLTAGE
  imbalance which caused 2.244 coulombs of charge to pass through the load
  point to equalize voltages of the two banks.

  ( 2.992 ) - ( .748 )= 2.244 coulombs moved through load point.

  Bank 1 is now .055 farads @ 11.15 volts  =  .613 coulombs
  Bank 2 is now .220 farads @ 11.15 volts  = 2.453 coulombs
  -----------------------------------------------------------
                       Total system charge = 3.066 coulombs

  At this point the voltage across C3 was measured at 11.15 volts.
  Total system charge is now calculated to be 3.066 coulombs. System charge
  loss from step 1 to step 2 calculated to be .674 coulombs.

Step three:

  C1,C2 placed in parallel. C3,C4 placed in series. This causes another
  VOLTAGE imbalance which causes 1.840 coulombs of charge to pass through
  the load point in order to equalize voltage potential between the two
  banks.

  ( 2.453 ) - ( .613) = 1.840 coulombs moved through load point.

  At this point the voltage across C1 was measured at 8.7 volts.
  Total system charge is now calculated to be 2.393 coulombs. System charge
  loss from step 2 to step 3 calculated to be .773 coulombs.

  Bank 1 is now .220 farad @ 8.7 volts = 1.914 coulombs
  Bank 2 is now .055 farad @ 8.7 volts =  .479 coulombs
  -------------------------------------------------------
                   Total system charge = 2.393 coulombs

 The battery is now connected to recharge C1,C2 through the load, and C3,C4
 directly. This moves another 1.078 coulombs through the load point while
 charging C1,C2. Total charge taken from battery to recharge whole system
 to 13.6 volts is 1.347 coulombs.

 ( 3.740 ) - ( 2.393 ) = 1.347 coulombs used from battery.

  Charge passed through load point:

                          step 1  =  2.244 coulombs
                          step 2  =  1.840 coulombs
                During Recharge   =  1.078 coulombs
                ------------------------------------
                           total  =  5.162 coulombs
       Charge taken from battery  =  1.347 coulombs
       ---------------------------------------------
               Over-Unity output  =  3.815 coulombs   or   383% "efficiency"

Several tests were conducted without any load resistance present in the
circuit (dead short across load point), and several tests were performed with
various types of resistive loads (electromagnet, bulbs, motor).

In every case, the measured charge potentials of the capacitors remained
virtually the same at every testing stage. The fact that purely resistive
loads don't "consume" electricity is shown in the circuit PROOF1.GIF.

Diodes do cause a voltage drop across the load and do lower the measured
voltages by about 1 volt per diode in series with the load.

I attribute the constant voltage drops to mechanical stress loss inside the
capacitors. Many small capacitors in parallel, as opposed to a large single
capacitor, might help offset the losses to a degree.

Bearden spoke of "laboratory grade" capacitors that have almost no internal
stress losses. These might provide a nearly lossless flex circuit.

Since there is a fixed amount of potential loss per cycle, it would be best
to design a load that makes the most use of each charge cycle. I suggest a
self-variable resistor in series with the load to maintain a constant useable
voltage/current through most of the transfer cycle.

The output is a high voltage spike that drops to zero over time in accordance
to load resistance. (20 volts down to 0 volts)

Using V=IR we should be able to construct a solid-state resistor that can be
set at any desired current level so that it will maintain a steady current
through the load during most of the charge cycle.

Bulbs, heater elements and magnets are directly useable without the use of
this variable resistance device.

IDEAS FOR DEVICES:

Build a motor that "flex's" power via the commutator. Collect the C.E.M.F.
from the stator magnets to feed charge back into the system. Use mechanical
torque of motor to drive generator. This motor should only need 4 stator
electromagnets and 2 permanent magnets on the rotor.

Build a "Testatika" device. Wheel is driven by HV pulses through stator
magnets. Leyden jars are arranged as in FLEXFLO2.gif and commutator
directs charges approprietly. Commutator is NOT full contact device; NO
CONTACT FRICTION LOSS! HV spark jumps small gap to transfer charge.
Meanwhile, charge is collected from static generator portion of device.

                    Tapping "Massless Displacement Current"
                      using a capacitor as a "collector"

                                      by

                             the anonymous F/E guy

                      See PROOF1.GIF for circuit diagram

This is a REAL EXPERIMENT that can be performed by anyone using only the
following materials:

   -   3 electrolytic capacitors
         2 are >50,000uF and one small one for the "collector", 10,000uF

   -   12 volt D.C. power source (for charging 1 capacitor)

   -   A good V.O.M. (digital preferred, or an O-scope)

Connect the two large capacitors as in the circuit in PROOF1.gif. Leave out
the variable resistor. This is where you'll be using the small capacitor.
Leave the "load" point open so that a load can be added in order to complete
the circuit.

   Step 1:  Make sure C1 and C2 are completely discharged. Charge C1 with the
            battery. Check the voltage across C1 and write it down.

   Step 2:  Short the connection across the load point to allow the charge
            from C1 to equalize with C2. Now check the voltage across C1 and
            also across C2. They should be the same. Write down the voltage
            readings.

   Step 3:  Repeat step 1. Now, make sure your small cap is discharged. Then,
            place it in series in the load point. Remove it from the load
            point and check the voltage on it. Now discharge it into a bulb
            or something.

   Step 4:  Place the small cap into the load point a few more times, each
            time removing, checking voltage, and discharging it. When it no
            longer goes above 0volts you can stop. That means that the
            potential differences in C1 and C2 have equalized. Check the
            voltage across C1 and then C2. They should be approximately the
            same readings that you found in step 2.

This circuit plainly shows that Bearden's "massless displacement current" is a
REAL and TANGIBLE substance. It can be extracted by repeatedly halting a D.C.
circuit with a small, or large, capacitor.

   Explanation:

     Current flows through a capacitor until it reaches a full charge. The
     same current flows on both sides of the capacitor.

     The charged capacitor can then be removed from the circuit, the massless
     displacement current is drawn off, and the capacitor is then placed back
     into the circuit where it fills up again.

     The same amount of current flows through the circuit each time. This is a
     passive "electrical milking" that can be performed on just about any D.C.
     circuit.

     If the "milking" was done in microsecond pulses, a normal electronic
     circuit would never realize it's happening.

     This could mean that many conventional power supplies, heaters, lamps,
     etc..., could be made to run with nothing but a single input pulse.

     With several stages of the same circuit stacked on top of each other,
     many everyday devices could be made self powering.

Well, there you go. I'm no electronic designer. I leave it up to those of
you who can make this into a solid state device of some sort.

                                    Enjoy!
