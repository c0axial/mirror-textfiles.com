                QUANTUM FLUCTUATIONS CREATE SILENT UPROAR IN SPACE
                  (ZERO POINT ENERGY WOULD SOLVE MANY PROBLEMS OF
                              PHYSICS AT ONE STROKE)

       Abstract:  It sounds like a fable: heaters heat and automobiles roll
                  and create not a gram of pollution driven by a mysterious
                  energy.  This same power  will make laptop computers more
                  powerful than   today's   super   computers    and   will
                  revolutionize other  technologies.   The  fantastic thing
                  here is: this super energy  which  is  supposed to do all
                  these things originates in empty space.

       Article:  US researchers  Harold  Puthoff,  Ken Shoulders  and  Bill
       Church from the  Institute  of  Advanced  Studies  in  Austin, Texas
       forecast this utopia.  The basis of their ideas is vacuum energy,  a
       power which fills the entire universe  and  probably  underlies  all
       material existence.  If the theories of the three researchers  prove
       out they would  eliminate  all  worries  about energy forever.  They
       would also solve  some  of the greatest  puzzles  of  cosmology  and
       particle physics including   the   question   of   the   nature   of
       gravitation.

       In the telescopes   of   the   astronomers   the   universe  appears
       majestically quiet and empty, only spotted here and there by massive
       world islands.  Quantum  theory,   on   the   other  hand,  shows  a
       different, much more bizarre view of the cosmos.  It  deals with the
       microcosm of subatomic  particles.   At the level of particles, like
       electrons, protons and neutrons, space  is  not empty, but a boiling
       sea of energy that fills the space between atoms  and  molecules  as
       well as between  the  stars.  Particles jump like spray in a foaming
       ocean, like lightning leaping out of an insubstantive energy bath

                                      Page 1





       into the material  world.   With equal rapidity these particles fall
       back into the  sea  of energy and  disappear  (physicists  speak  of
       "virtual particles", because they have no existence  in the world of
       real particles).  In  this  minute instant of their existence, these
       ghost particles send out a weak pulse  of electromagnetic waves.  To
       be sure, the radiation from individual particles  dissipates  in  an
       extremely short distance.   But  because these elements of radiation
       are generated constantly  and everywhere,  space  is  filled  by  an
       enormous amount of energy.

       The energy density of the vacuum exceeds that in the  nucleus  of an
       atom.  The American physicists John Wheeler and Richard Feynman have
       calculated that the  energy  in the vacuum of a single light bulb is
       sufficient to bring all the water  in the oceans of the world to the
       boiling point.  At the same time this tremendous  energy  cannot  be
       felt.  The reason:   it   permeates  the  universe  equally  in  all
       directions.  Thus, matter is held in balance between equal forces.

       Nevertheless, this vacuum  energy   leaves   its  trace  in  certain
       physical phenomena.  According    to   classical   physics,    every
       oscillator, like a  pendulum,  eventually  comes  to rest because of
       friction.  Quantum theory,  on  the   other  hand,  states  that  an
       oscillator never comes  completely  to  rest, but will  continue  to
       oscillate in microscopically  small  random  motions around its rest
       point, even when  it  has  been cooled  to  absolute  zero  so  that
       molecular heat motion  is  not  a  consideration.    Cause   of  the
       unpredictable vibration is the so-called zero point energy.

       The source of   the   vibrations,   in   turn,   are  the  energetic
       fluctuations of the vacuum.  These  provide  the  virtual  particles
       with their electromagnetic radiations.  Particles that  are embedded
       in this ocean  of  radiation  are  caused to tremble by the constant
       impacts of the  virtual  particles.   (This  trembling  has  serious
       consequences in many physical systems.  For example, the unavoidable
       noise of a  microwave  receiver.   Even  the  most   perfect  cannot
       suppress this noise,  since  it  is  caused by the zero point energy
       that creates the radiations in this wavelength.

       As early as  1940,  US  physicist   William   Lamb  discovered  that
       fluctuations of the  electromagnetic  field can easily  disturb  the
       paths of electrons  around  the atomic nucleus.  This results in the
       "Lamb displacement" (photons that  are  created  by  the shifting of
       electrons into a different path show a frequency displaced  from the
       normal value.)

       The simple fact  that  an  electron  orbits  the atomic nucleus on a
       stable path is  a  great  puzzle   of   physics.   Classical  theory
       describes the atom  like a small planetary system: electron  planets
       orbit the sun of the atomic nucleus.  Electromagnetic fields work on
       charged particles.  The  particles  are forced out of their path and
       react by radiating light.  The photons  (light  particles) carry off
       the energy picked  up  from  the electromagnetic field.   One  would
       therefore expect electrons which are forced into their orbital paths
       by the nucleus  charge,  to send out radiations and fall in a spiral
       path into the nucleus like a satellite  falling  to  earth.  Quantum
       theory does not explain why this does not happen.   It describes the
       characteristics of the  particles  and  declares that they only jump
       back and forth  between  specific  energy  levels  in  the  electron
       orbits.  Since they cannot drop below the lowest energy level, they

                                      Page 2





       do not fall  into  the nucleus.  Even the quantizing of the electron
       paths does not explain the physical background for their stability.

       Harold Puthoff, physicist at the Texas  think  tank, believes he has
       the answer: again he sees the ZPE at work.  According  to  his idea,
       electrons do radiate  energy  while orbiting the atomic nucleus, but
       they absorb an   equal  amount   of   energy   from   the   electron
       fluctuations, and so  the atom is saved from collapse.   Writing  in
       the New Scientist,  Puthoff said, "The equilibrium between these two
       processes leads to  the  values  for the parameters which define the
       fundamental energy condition.   Therefore  there  exists  a  dynamic
       equilibrium in which the zero point energy stabilizes  the  electron
       in the its  orbital  condition.   It  appears  that the stability of
       matter itself depends   upon   the    fundamental   ocean   of   the
       electromagnetic fluctuations."

       Also, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle appears  in  a  new  light.
       This principles states  that  it  is impossible to determine all the
       conditions of a physical system at  the  same time, for example, the
       position and velocity of a particle.  If the velocity of an electron
       is determined, its  position  remains unclear: although  a  discrete
       particle, it appears  smeared  over  a larger area.  Only statistics
       helped quantum physicists  out of  their  dilemma.   This  makes  it
       possible at least to calculate the probability with which a particle
       with a certain  energy  can be found in a certain position.   For  a
       long time this  indeterminacy  was  considered  a  characteristic of
       matter itself.  Actually, it is the  ZPE  which causes the particles
       to tremble.  Their exact position must therefore necessarily  appear
       unclear, says Puthoff.   The  uncertainty  principle  is therefore a
       direct effect of vacuum fluctuations.

       Puthoff even has a new slant on gravitational  theory.  Einstein saw
       gravity as a  warping  of  space caused by the mass  of  objects  in
       space.  Galaxies, stars,   and   planets   cause  depressions  in  4
       dimensional space, like  marbles  on  a  taughtly  stretched  rubber
       surface.  If the  marbles  approach  each other, they  roll  in  the
       direction of the  indentations  caused by their weight.  "This shows
       how gravity functions, but it doesn't  explain  the mechanism behind
       it," says the  US  physicist.   Again, Puthoff's famous  theory,  as
       written up in  the  Physical Review, sees the power of the vacuum at
       work.  As two bodies approach each  other  one  will  screen off the
       second from the  radiation  field  of  the  ZPE  coming   from  it's
       direction.  And vice  versa.   Out of all the other directions these
       bodies continue under  the  influence   of   the   pressure  of  the
       fluctuations.  The result: they move toward one another.

       It now appears no longer necessary to unite gravitation  in  an  all
       encompassing theory with  the  other  three  fundamental  powers  of
       nature - the electromagnetic as well  as the strong and weak nuclear
       forces.  The creation of a unified field theory has  hitherto caused
       physicists tremendous difficulties.     Although   the   theory   of
       electromagnetic fields could be tied  to  radioactive  decay and the
       power that holds the atomic nucleus together, gravity  did  not  fit
       into any of  the  mathematical concepts which grew into increasingly
       abstract Babylonian towers  of  physics,   and   were   consequently
       unsuccessful.

       As a result of the ZPE, gravitation is not seen to  be a fundamental
       power but is only a secondary effect, resulting from the alternating

                                      Page 3





       functioning of other  fields.   In  this  form  gravity is already a
       component of the unified field theory.   At the same time it becomes
       clear why gravity is so weak, always pushing and never pulling and -
       in contrast with  electromagnetic  fields - it cannot  be  shielded:
       vacuum fluctuations penetrate  space  itself.  The recently deceased
       Russian physicist, Andrei Sakarov,  also saw gravitation as a result
       of the inter-workings of the vacuum energy and matter.  This  should
       make it possible   to  calculate  the  value  of  the  gravitational
       constant G by parameters derived  from  the  theory of ZPE.  Puthoff
       followed Sakarov's ideas with some success.  So particles  that  are
       coupled through vacuum  fluctuation  fields experience an attractive
       force on the order of gravitation.

       As far back as the 60's, physicist  Timothy  Boyer  of New York city
       college combined formulas  of  classical  physics  with  the  random
       fields of ZPE.   It  was  his  goal  to reproduce the entire quantum
       theory with this   approach.   The   result:   Boyer's   "Stochastic
       Electrodynamics" produced in  many  cases the same  results  as  Max
       Planks' Quantum Electrodynamics,  among  others  in  regard  to  the
       radiation of black bodies, with "harmonic oscillators", with Van der
       Walls forces as well as the Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.  "If
       the physicists had taken this path  around 1900 they would have done
       much better with this classical approach than with  Plank's  quantum
       theory", commented Boyer's colleague Peter Milonni of the Los Alamos
       National Laboratory.

       The way this  cosmic power could be used to generate energy is shown
       by the effect named after the Dutch  Physicist,  Hendrix B. Casimir.
       Two smooth metal  plates  held  apart  a  very small  distance  must
       attract each other  very  powerfully.   The  reason:  in  the  space
       between the plates there are far fewer  vacuum  fluctuations than in
       the space outside.  The pressure of the radiation, therefore, pushes
       the plates together  -  as it also pushes heavenly  bodies  together
       (accordingly gravity is   a   macro  demonstration  of  the  Casimir
       effect).  At the meeting of the plates an enormous amount of heat is
       generated - the vacuum energy is translated  into useful energy.  Of
       course this can only be done once with each pair of plates,  because
       to separate the  plates  to  start  a  new cycle would  require  the
       application of the  energy  liberated in the previous cycle.  Expert
       Ken Shoulders came up with a different  solution.  He wants to use a
       cold electrically charged  plasma (in a plasma the  nuclei  and  the
       electrons are separated)  to generate energy.  The Casimir effect is
       supposed to compress the plasma  which  would  generate  heat.   The
       repulsion of the nuclei drives the dense gas apart,  and a new cycle
       begins.

       Shoulders discovered another  phenomenon  that could be based on the
       Casimir effect.  "If electrons are  packed  together with sufficient
       force they no  longer  repel  each  other but form clusters.   These
       electron clusters require  no  electrical conductors.  For instance,
       they run in small rills of a ceramic  body  -  in  fact,  a thousand
       times faster than   in   a  semiconductor,"   declared   the   Texas
       researcher.  An energetic  spark discharge is sufficient to generate
       these clusters.  Ultrafast   chips    and    greatly    miniaturized
       instruments are possible uses of such dense clusters.  One thinks of
       extremely flat TV screens with the electronic components  integrated
       in the screen,  very  tiny  xray  generators which could be inserted
       into the body  of the patient to  radiate  tumors,  or  one  hundred
       horsepower motors that are only slightly larger than the crankshaft.

                                      Page 4





       But where does  the ZPE come from?  "There are two thoughts on this.
       One says that it is simply a part  of the boundary conditions of our
       universe the same as the background radiation resulting from the big
       bang",  explained vacuum  expert  Puthoff.   The  other  requires  a
       stronger imagination: the  quantum  fluctuations drive the trembling
       (to which Puthoff ascribed Heisenberg's  Uncertainty  Principle)  of
       all the material  particles  in  the  universe.  The  sum  of  these
       motions, however, could generate the zero point fields which in turn
       generate the virtual  particles  and  their  radiation  field, which
       again causes the physical particles  to  vibrate  - something like a
       cat chasing its  own  tail.   Puthoff  calls this phenomenon,  which
       possibly keeps the   whole   cosmos   running,   a  "self-generating
       cosmological feedback", which  began   with   an  elementary  random
       fluctuation: the big bang.
