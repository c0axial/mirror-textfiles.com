The following is excerpted from the very strange Arthur Matthews book, 'The
Wall of Light', subtitled 'Nikola Tesla and the Venusian Space Ship, the X-
12' and claiming to be an autobiography of Nikola Tesla.

This particular anecdote is intriguing in light of ongoing interest in
teleportation, manifestation of matter from energy, transmutation and general
'aether engineering'.

Keep in mind that Tesla claimed that light, cosmic rays and some other
energies were in fact highly charged particles moving at tremendous velocities
(Tesla did not believe in Einstein's Theory of Relativity).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gold from Mars

Matthews claimed he had been in contact with a spaceship and its occupants and
that this X-12 spaceship carried him off to the planet Mars.  On their arrival
on Mars, the two aliens (Frank and Frances) and Matthews disembarked and began
to look around, the quote follows;

...we walked toward a large group of rocks, but what rocks!  Some of them were
about 45 feet in diameter, and thousands of them covered that which appeared
to be, otherwise, a large field, and in the far distance were a range of
hills.  We walked up to the nearest large rock, which appeared to be almost
jet black.

Frank scraped away a layer of soft earth, and by so doing, disclosed something
bright.  "What is it?" I asked.  "Looks like gold," replied Frank.  "Gold!" I
exclaimed.  "Yes," said. Frank, "it is pure gold, but to be sure, let us test
it, shall we?"  Of course I agreed, so we returned to the X-12 and obtained a
test outfit, something like the Tesla-Bridge, with which we soon proved the
rock to be pure gold!"

    (So what is this Tesla bridge?  Perhaps some kind of balanced resistor,
     capacitor or inductor network to determine the element?  Perhaps even a
     type of frequency discriminator working on principles similar to nuclear
     magnetic resonance?...>>> Jerry)

We then made a test of all the nearby rocks, and to our surprise, and delight
all of the rocks in the field were indeed, solid gold.  "Well," I remarked,
"if we could bring that one big rock to earth, we would be the richest people
on our world.  There is more gold in that one rock (pointing to the 45 foot
high monster) than in all of our world!"

    (wouldn't that be a solid proof of ET contact....<g>.....>>>  Jerry)

"OK," said Frank, "if it could be done, but as you know, it is not possible."
"I do not know any such thing," answered Frank.  "It is not only possible to
transport all of this gold to earth, but I will prove it to you!"  "Well
Frank," I said, "I have every reason to believe you, but it is beyond my
understanding, at the moment, just how you can do this.  That is to move this
heavy mass, which must weigh many times more than your great X-12!  I cannot
imagine how you can even place it into your ship.  How long it will require to
break it into pieces small enough to lift into your ship, even if you do lift
them with a hoist through the hatch."

Frank laughed, "No my dear Arthur, we will not move one piece either by hand
or with our hoist.  We shall first return to earth, and then, if you still
desire to be the richest man on earth, we will bring it right into your field,
without lifting one ounce.".....

After a bit of sightseeing.....

Frank decided it was time for us to get back to the X-12.  We bid goodbye to
the six who had first met us, and also to a great number of others as we
walked the beautiful streets in this wonderful City of Light.  Back on board
the X-12, on our long trip back to Earth the question in my mind was the gold
rocks which the Martians said we could have.  I was wondering, would we be
coming back to Mars soon?  And in what manner Frank would place that heavy
bold in the X-12.

To my question Frank said "Think well about this large amount of gold.  Will
having all that in your possession keep you happy and in good health?  Do you
know anyone on earth who has millions of dollars who is truly happy, healthy
and well?  Consider it well my friend.  The gold is yours if you wish to have
it, but in my opinion, nothing can replace your present well being, your good
health, and the joy you share with others.  Therefore I want you to think the
matter over until we arrive near to earth.  Then, and only then, give me your
answer."

Frank then left me to my thoughts while he went about the great ship.  It
required deep thought.  Few, if any, earth men had seen even one-thousandth
part of the amount of gold in that big rock.  As the owner of it, I will not
trouble you with all my thoughts, except to say that I came to the conclusion
not to have the gold!

When we came within a few miles of the earth, Frank and Frances came to talk
with me.  "Well," asked Frank, "have you made up your mind?  Do you, or do you
not, want that gold?"  In reply I found it hard at first, but managed to say,
"No, Frank, I do not want that gold, but I would like you to tell me how you
expected to bring it to earth, if I had said yes?"  Frank said "Good thinking
Arthur, we are very pleased to hear you say that you do not want the gold, as
for the means by which we can bring the gold to earth, if you desire I will
show you.  As it is still daylight, we will remain at this level, and during
our wait, which will be several hours, we might just as well set up our
machine, by which we can transport the gold of Mars right onto your property."

Frank grinned at me as we walked into the workshop on the second level of the
X-12.  "In this manner I will show you that which I intended to do, if it was
your wish to have all that gold, however we are more than pleased to know that
you do not want it.  But we shall, if you like, transport just a little of
that gold, to prove to you that we could, if it was your desire, place all of
it right in your field?"

Frank gathered together an assortment of things, tools and materials,
electrical parts, wire, condensers, ect., and with all these things, I helped
Frank to build a machine, a queer looking thing, which I thought was a very
large high-frequency generator, until Frank enlightened me to what it really
was.

"This," said Frank, "is the Tesla method of developing a microwave of great
power.  Thousands of horse-power is by this means built into a tiny beam, of
less than one degree in diameter.  By the power which we have on the X-12 we
shall operate this machine, when we land on your property.

                       (1000 Horsepower = 746,000 Watts)

The tiny wave, or ray, developed will be directed exactly to hit the desired
rock of gold.  This gold rock, now located on the planet Mars, will be our
POSITIVE POLE, then by means of this Tesla device the power ray, or beam, will
be reflected from the gold rock, that is the POSITIVE atoms, and directed
towards this NEGATIVE POLE.

The gold is now broken up into its microscopic elements and becomes united
with the elements of the microwave and thus carried to the negative pole by
means of the reflective elements of the power ray.

The Tesla device is therefore a practical method of transmutation of solids,
that is the extracting ore or metal from a distant body without intervening
physical means."  By the time we had completed the machine, it was late
evening, the X-12 completed the trip, and we landed around 10PM.  We set up
the machine in our field, beside the X-12.

Frank applied the power and directed the Ray so that it would hit the gold
rock on Mars, then driven by accurate clockwork, the wave could be depended
upon to retain the proper direction, when once set.  The ray was thus aimed
directly, as I have said, at the large rock of pure gold.  With breathless
interest I watched the proceedings of Frank.  The strain upon my poor nerves
was such as could not have been borne for many hours at a stretch!

When everything had been adjusted to his satisfaction, Frank stepped back and
pressed a lever.  The powerful atomic engine, which he had built a few hours
ago, instantly responded.  "The beam is set exactly in the center of the large
gold rock," said Frank.

Then we waited; a minute elapsed, two minutes!  I could hear the beating of my
heart - the engine shook the ground - three minutes!  Four minutes!

We were like statues with eyes fixed on the polished ball of silver, supported
by means of a high metal frame-work, which had a polished rod curved over the
top like a crane.  This was in fact the pole from which the energy was
transmitted to the golden rock on Mars.  Five minutes!  "At last!" I shouted.
"Look!  Look!"

The shining ball had become a confused blue in colour, and I violently winked
to clear my eyes.  "At last!"  The silver knob again changed colour, what
seemed like a miniature rainbow surrounded it with concentric circles of
blinding brilliance.

Then something dropped flashing into a dish set beneath the ball, another, and
another, glittering drop followed, and another, almost before a word could be
spoken the drops had coalesced and become a tiny stream, which, as it fell,
twisted itself into a bright spiral, gleaming with many shifting hues, then
overflowing from the dish.

The tiny stream gradually grew in size, faster and yet faster it flowed, an
interlacing maze of rings.  After the five minute start, we timed the flow at
one ounce per minute.  Frank said this could be speeded up to a much greater
amount.  Frank let the machine operate for another minute, then turned off the
power and we placed the parts of this wonderful machine into the X-12.  Frank
and Frances bid me goodbye with the promise of returning soon.

...and they left for Mars.....
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This book has several such anecdotes, all of which are intriguing to one
degree or another.

With regard to this particular story, it raises some interesting possibilities
because in nature, positive (high pressure) flows to negative (low pressure),
so it follows that if you could charge something up to a very high positive
potential, you might be able to cause it to emit tiny particles which could be
accumulated on a cathode.

Thousands of horsepower would probably go well into the megawatt range which
would be possible to generate with an atomic power source, although I wonder
about popping one together in a few hours.  If the microwave transmitter was
tuned to the resonant frequency of the gold and at these very high potentials,
this story almost makes sense.

As some of us here at KeelyNet have been studying of late, the earth is
positively charged and the upper atmosphere is negative, on the order of
hundreds of thousands of negative volts.

My friend Guy Smith, informs me that Tom Bearden referred to something called
a MURRAY AMPLIFIER in a lecture Guy had attended several years ago.  Guy says
he never found anything written about this device, but Bearden indicated it
to have been a matter transporter that worked instantly.  According to Guy,
Bearden said that satellites had for some time been of sufficient number to be
able to image the entire earth from many angles.

A very bright flash was seen emanating from the United States and recorded on
satellite photos along with the time and position.  At the same time and
exactly 180 degrees away, in a straight line through the earth, another
identical bright flash was seen in China.  Bearden was speculating this to
have been a test of the Murray Amplifier.  If you know anything about this
Murray Amplifier, we here at KeelyNet would greatly appreciate either a source
or photocopies of your information.

So, in the case of the Martian gold, we have a microwave transmitter, isolated
from the earth's positive geoelectric field and emitting a very high power,
positively charged, ELEMENTALLY tuned microwave beam through space to a metal
object on another planet.

One possible explanation is an altered duty cycle, where a return path could
be created by imbalancing the wave in its duty cycle, so that the negative
wave was of longer duration than the positive.  The positive beam would expand
the mass (think of it as a 'slowed lightning' process where mass is normally
expanded very rapidly, causing it to explode) to produce the gradual decay of
the excited mass, the negative would carry back these highly charged
components to be received on a very highly charged negative pole.

Once the electronic transport process was begun, it would accelerate over time
as the waves began to permeate the mass to ever greater degrees, which could
explain why more gold flowed as time progressed.

In a way, the cathode can be thought of as a negative well or drain for the
returning positive energies, with those energies carrying the elemental
components that will concentrate and reform as the element on the cathode.

Another point was the color change, described as a 'shining ball...with a
confused blue colour' on the negative condensing ball, indicating either
heating or some kind of high voltage plasma because of the second comment,
'a miniature rainbow surrounded it with concentric circles of blinding
brilliance'.  Gold and other shiny metallic surfaces have been described as
reflecting a 'prismatic' or 'chromatic' light.

There is another intriguing concept which relates to this subject.  It deals
with the formation of elements as veins and nodes in the earth by the action
of 'telluric currents'.  As far as I can understand this, it ties in with the
Chinese dragon currents called 'lung mei' which again correlate with both ley
and grid lines.

Something produces the signature of an element at a given location, probably
the coincidence of two or more energy streams either at a given frequency or
producing that frequency when these energies interfere.

Old European mines, particularly in Germany, were held within the control of
families over the centuries.  Once the mine had been almost fully depleted,
the family would seal it off for a long period of time.  After 50 or 100 years
or so, the mine would again be opened up, where they claimed the ore had
'regenerated' via the action of these telluric currents.

Since the 'nodal signature' of the mine seems to be tuned to the nature of the
element that is mined there, the idea was that these currents would transport
'free radicals' of this element (attracted by resonance) to the site, thus
replenishing it.  The key to allowing this process to happen was to seal off
the mine to prevent any disturbing influences that would interfere with the
telluric currents.

I won't be able to do the crude diagram in the book justice using ASCII
characters and the description does not appear to match the diagram but here
it is;

           description, there are several possible configurations, though
           I believe this one to be closest to the machine as described and
           in the book drawing.  The 'cathode attractor' and 'silver
           accumulator' could be swapped.......>>>  Jerry

Also note that sputtering and vaporization of gold is routinely done for the
formation of integrated circuits.  The ping pong ball captured in a high
velocity airstream also might relate to this claim where the ionized particles
might be captured in the high velocity return/reflected beam.

The dual arms, being separated as they are, appear to be taking advantage of a
transmitter and reflector angle.  The positive microwave beams charge the
target and that energy reflects back to the negative pole receiver.

Once reflected from the target, it is still a highly charged positive energy
but is now laden with the element that has been removed from the target.  Now,
the material must be 'precipitated' by use of the negative collecting,
condensing properties of the cathode.

The end of the arm that originates from the central large toroid to hang out
in front of the accumulator, appears to be creating a very high tension
negative electrostatic field, probably oscillating at the frequency of the
gold element.  This produces the coalescence of the particles into gold drops
as described by Matthews.

This is one approach to teleportation or matter transference which I've not
seen detailed to any degree anywhere else.  Though this approach appears to be
slow at the rate of one ounce per minute, it only takes duplication of it to
prove the concept and make it subject to faster transport speed experiments.
These might be directly dependent on the focal point of the beam and/or the
distances involved.

In the case of large scale matter, some kind of scanned matrix might be a more
viable approach.  Though there are indications that some kind of 'signature'
would be the most efficient approach to take.  When we get further details on
the Murray system or any others in this area of study, they will be posted on
KeelyNet.
