       Vangard Note...

           Though ESJ has only been in publication for three issues now, we
           find it most stimulating and informative.  The best part is that
           the authors actually DO experiments  and  document  them  in the
           articles so  that the readers can try it themselves.   This  can
           lead to  many  other  ideas  for experiments as seen through the
           diverse perspectives  of  others.    THIS   MAGAZINE   IS  WORTH
           SUBSCRIBING TO IF YOU HAVE A PENCHANT FOR EXPERIMENTATION!

                               Hyde Generator Report

       George Hathaway has  built  the electrostatic portion  of  the  Hyde
       generator.  He explains :

             "Between stator  segments  we  only saw some 10 volts P-P when
              excited by up to 5,000 volts  on the 'Excitor' end plates and
              operation at up to 4,000 rpm with an 8-1/2" diameter rotor.

                                      Page 1





              This was  unaffected  by  gap distance between excitor plates
              (and the) rotor, as well as adjustment of the commutator.

              Hyde states that he has seen  up  to  300  KV  between  rotor
              segments!  Either  he still is withholding  some  information
              from the patent, or has been fooling himself.

              His little  diode/capacitor  circuit  for  stepping down high
              voltage is useless, as shown  in  the  patent,  [US  Patent #
              4,897,592 as  reported  in out last issue,  Ed.]  (listed  on
              KeelyNet with  diagrams  as  HYDEGIF)  for  doing  what  Hyde
              claims.

              In fact,  I believe that only  an  actively-switched  voltage
              divider will do what he claims that circuit  should  do.   My
              tests have  been  witnessed  by two others, an engineer and a
              physicist.  My device has  24  stator  and  12 rotor segments
              each side."

       --------------------------------------------------------------------
              The following is taken from Moray Kings paper regarding
                  the Hyde device and listed on KeelyNet as ZPE3.
           It shows that Hyde has gone beyond his patent specifications.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

          The rotors in the patent description were electrically  connected
          by brushes  to  their   adjacent   stators,  BUT  HYDE  HAS SINCE
          IMPROVED HIS INVENTION HIS INVENTION  BY  REMOVING  THESE CONTACT
          (66).  The field from the excitor plates induces  a  polarization
          between the connected rotors.

          The segments  on  both rotors are aligned to allow them to shield
          an aligned pair of stator segments.   As the rotor spins, aligned
          stator segments  are  ALTERNATELY EXPOSED and SHEILDED  from  the
          excitor polarization field.

          Each stator segment is electrically  connected to its counterpart
          on the  other  stator  through a PULSE RECTIFIER CIRCUIT in which
          the transient voltage pulses are  stepped down and then channeled
          to a combining rectifier output circuit (not shown).

          It is  a  surprise  that  such a simple  device as  Hyde's  could
          output anomalous power.  An analysis using just classical physics
          would predict  that  the  voltage induced across a stator segment
          pair would swing between zero and the excitor plate voltage since
          this is  the steady state limit  for  the  shielded  and  exposed
          conditions.  This is observed when the rotor is spun slowly.

          However, when the rotor is spun on the order of  6000 rpm, a 3 KV
          potential across  the  excitor  plates  yields  stator  pulses in
          excess of 300 KV with a very small drag on the rotor (67).

       --------------------------------------------------------------------
         The following is from the Hyde Patent  (listed  as text only under
             HYDEPTNT on KeelyNet or with .GIFs and text as HYDEGIF) :
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

            It was therefore found that working embodiments  of the present
            invention require less than ten percent of the electrical

                                      Page 2





            output energy for the mechanical input.

            Further, ACCORDING  TO  ONE PROTOTYPE model of the invention, a
            relatively high output voltage  of  300,000  volts was obtained
            across the stators.

            By reason of such high voltage, an output circuit  30  having a
            voltage reducing   and   current   multiplying   attribute   as
            hereinbefore described was selected  so as to render the system
            suitable for many practical applications.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Of course, inventors  who  seek  patents  do  so with  the  hope  of
       financial recompense for   their   efforts,   that  is  the  primary
       inducement to seek the patent in the first place.

       Put yourself in the inventors place  as  to just how much detail you
       would place in  a  patent  open to public access for  the  price  of
       $1.00?  Patents are  SUPPOSED  to  be written with sufficient detail
       that anyone "skilled in the art"  would  be  able  to  duplicate the
       invention.

       It would be very helpful if the inventor would provide  full details
       and possibly a  video  showing  his device in operation.  That video
       could then be sold for extra income.   He  could  additionally offer
       detailed plans if he wanted confirmation that his device worked from
       independent sources.  This would further accelerate  interest in the
       device and no doubt lead to vast improvements in the technology.

       As in the HYDEOFFR file on KeelyNet, the lawyers have been empowered
       to offer a  non-negotiable, non-exclusive license for 5 million plus
       $2 per machine produced.  Since the  inventor  is  in  hiding due to
       threats against his life, the only contact possible  is  through the
       lawyers and possibly Moray King.

       We will continue  to  keep  you  posted  on  what  goes on with this
       particular free energy device based on our sources of information.
