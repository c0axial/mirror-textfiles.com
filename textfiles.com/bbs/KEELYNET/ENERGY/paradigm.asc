  Some observers believe that the controversial devices that claim to produce
more energy than they consume may actually operate on ambient free energy -- a
form of energy existing all around us, the nature of which has been eluding
our scientists.  Most free energy researchers are outside the mainstream
science, which still denies the existence of such energy.

  The controversial Joseph Newman is a Mississippi inventor who designed a
mechanical engine which allegedly produces more energy than it uses.  He has
been trying for years to get a patent on it without success (presumably
because no logical theory exists to explain it).  A similar claim regarding
energy production/consumption was made by researchers in Utah and England, who
explained their device by claiming they had achieved fusion of atomic nuclei
at room temperature--"cold fusion"--which, if true, would open the way to
tapping the nearly limitless energy inside the atom.  Their claim was later
discounted by the scientific world.

   (as of 1994, cold fusion has been successfully replicated hundreds of times
    and work is ongoing in many countries, especially Japan...Vanguard)

  I believe that non-fraudulent devices which claim to produce more energy
than they would use could operate by tapping into ambient MACROSCOPIC energy
(here at Earth's surface, "Earth energy").  Such machines would resonate, or
"tune into," an energy that exists all around us, and draw in that energy.

  The free-energy field today is as much of a free-for-all as it ever was.
Researchers continue to come up with free-energy devices, "healing energy"
crystals, and the like.  Each researcher has his or her own theory for how
they work, with no two theorists agreeing.  Joe Newman claims his device works
via the action of energy-particles which he calls "gyrotrons." These have
properties not known to science.  A similar device, designed by a German named
Hans Nieper, supposedly uses gravitational forces.  But there has been no
wide-ranging theoretical model (paradigm) able to address the important
scientific questions and the anomalous energy phenomena.  And, of course,
there are no systematic experimental protocols for testing such a paradigm.

  The lack of interest shown by most physicists toward these anomalous
products may not be justified.  Despite its many accomplishments in
electronic/magnetic technology, physics still lacks a clear understanding of
magnetism and gravitation, and physicists might be expected to have some
interest in examining alternative avenues that may have a bearing on more
common, recognized energy systems.  Perhaps energy systems as they exist in
nature are fundamentally different in some way from the technological systems
our scientists use and upon which they base their theories.

  What about psychic and other paranormal phenomena, such as spontaneous human
combustion?  Do they involve the same "mystery energy" as free-energy devices.
Orthodox science still doesn't admit the reality of paranormality--a posture
that doesn't carry very well with the substantial number of people who believe
they have experienced or witnessed unquestionable instances of telepathic and
other paranormal phenomena.

  Telepathy is a common psychic theme.  The clarity and definition of
telepathic mental images over vast distances indicates that such transmissions
must travel via a medium with virtually infinite features.

  Another psychic theme is metal bending.  I personally know of sessions in
which novices are taught to psychically bend metal utensils.

          THE 'AURA' PARADIGM

   An "aura" paradigm of energy would be very attractive for explaining these
kinds of phenomena.  According to this model, all solid objects--including
humans and metallic objects--would have auric energy fields.  The energy waves
of two dissimilar objects, when resonating with each other (as when you "tune
in" your radio to a specific radio station's frequency) react with each other.

  Auric energy could be associated with or attached to the tiny particles
comprising matter, so that auric energy would exist within as well as near
solid bodies.  An object like a spoon could be affected by auric energy
transmissions resonating at the frequency of the spoon's aura and that comes
from another body--such as that of a human.

          THE NATURE OF AURIC ENERGY

  The fact that science has not delineated such an energy up to now suggests
that auric energy, if it exists, would have to consist of energy transmissions
of a different nature than the atomic particles thus far characterized by
physics--electrons, neutrons, and so on.  The medium of auric energy
transmissions would necessarily have to be of the same nature--a kind of
super-fine ether composed of tiny particle-units.  It would be a medium that
theoretically could allow transmissions of a more dynamic and precise nature
than the kinds of energy systems used by science.  This theoretical medium
would allow for phenomena with virtually infinite ranges and other features as
described in the literature of psychic phenomena.

  In the 1920s, when Einstein's theory of gravity was that of a U.S. Navy
scientist named T.J.J. See, who proposed that gravity arises from a wave-
effect in a universal ether.  See's model was endorsed by Edgar Cayce and
Nikola Tesla.  See pointed out that energy waves, such as light waves, become
wider (their amplitude increases) the closer they are to a heavenly body like
Earth.  He proposed that gravity waves, magnetic waves, and all other waves
must do so also.  His model of gravity involved the concept of a "vacuum"
created in the ether by the widening of "waves of force" near to a body like
Earth.  (See did not explain why waves widen close to a body.)

  The aura model supplies the missing link in See's model.  To understand how
this would work, one first would have to see how this aura theory applies to
magnetism on a planet like Earth and planetary magnetic fields.

          THE SECRET OF GRAVITY

  In an aura model of energy, the massive Earth has the controlling or
"parent" aura.  All smaller auras, like that of humans, metals, etc. acquire a
variety of features (such as magnetism) as they resonate with Earth's
surrounding energies (magnet-type directionality is a pervasive theme in
psychic phenomena, such as telepathy, metal bending, dowsing, etc.).  The aura
model of energy must focus on Earth magnetism.

  The aura model leads to a much simpler model of Earth magnetism than the
currently accepted model.  The latter is based on a complicated series of
hypothetical radioactive and other processes in the central core, 2,000 miles
down.  In an aura model, Earth's three layers--core, surface crust, and
intervening mantle--would each emit a vast auric energy field from its huge
mass, and the three fields would resonate with each other to produce the
planetary energy field.  The magnetism of this field (Earth's magnetic field)
results from the way these field resonations occur.  Physicists call this
linear resonation.

  This vast auric energy, close to a heavenly body such as Earth, would
include a large quantity of magnetized or auric energy particles.  The ether
in space would be relatively nonmagnetized when compared to the aura of a
planet.  Therefore, the energy of the auric particles of the ether in space
will be different form the energy of the particles when the ether approaches a
body such as a planet.

  See pointed out that if an ether exists, the elastic power must be enormous
because it would have a stupendous number of minuscule particles.  It would
exert more force in space than close to a cosmic body, where the ether "thins
out" and where wave transmissions "widen out."

  The aura model contends that solid bodies' atoms are in a constant flux,
continuously emitting and absorbing very fine auric-energy particles.  Thus,
close to a solid body, the ether particles would be modified (magnetized) by
their interactions with the atoms and auric influences of the bodies.  The
ether would thin out.  Etheric particles would combine into larger units like
atoms, resulting in a smaller number of larger particles.  In space, the ether
would consist of a much larger number of smaller particles.  The latter would
be much more forceful, gravitationally.

          CONCLUSION

  The kind of cosmic model one is finally led to by the aura/ether concept is
one of a dense ether out in space exerting powerful gravitational force toward
cosmic bodies, where the ether is thinned out by resonating with the atoms of
the bodies.  This cosmic model is much simpler than the accepted model.  Many
believe that the simplest model which explains all phenomena is the best one,
making the auric model more compelling than those that postulate multiple
forces and multiple dimensions, and deny the existence of auric forces.

  Newton's mathematical formula for the force of gravity--gravity being
inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two objects--
suggests that gravity is a single, simple force.  Gravity, as mathematically
defined by Newton and Einstein, does not mix with rest of particle/energy
theory, so physicists have been postulating additional forces to make it fit.
The true solution may lie elsewhere.

  Only recently have we become aware of the energies contained within the
planet.  Gravity, the magnetic field, and the radioactivity in the earth all
required that instruments be invented before they could be measured.  The
purpose of this article has been to present rationale for the existence of
auric forces not yet perceived by science, and to suggest that we ought to
think of our world as comprising not just objects but auras.

Observations by John W. Peters:

  1. The author mentions that T.J.J. See didn't explain why energy waves widen
     out near heavenly bodies.  My idea is that See viewed waves of energy
     encountering physical bodies like radio waves encountering a tuned
     circuit; the circuit tends to collect and amplify signals at the
     circuit's resonant frequency.  Since the tuned circuit extracts RF from
     the surrounding medium and concentrates it within itself, the nearby
     surrounding medium becomes deficient in electromagnetic energy at the
     circuit's frequency; hence the medium is less full (a partial vacuum) of
     energy at that frequency.

  2. The rationale given in Observation #1 easily explains the existence of
     both low-density (outer space) and high-density (physical) regions in our
     universe due to absences and concentrations of energy.

  3. The article does seem to offer a plausible explanation for various types
     of phenomena.
