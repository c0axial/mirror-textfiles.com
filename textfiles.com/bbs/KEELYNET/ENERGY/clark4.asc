            OVER-UNITY OUTPUT VIA MODIFICATION TO STANDARD MANUFACTURED
                          ELECTRIC GENERATORS AND MOTORS
                                        by
                              Richard L. Clark, Ph.D.

       The standard manufactured   electrical   generator  systems  can  be
       modified inexpensively to the Over-Unity  design  concept.   By  the
       addition of a second set of commutator brushes and/or  the  addition
       of a second slip-ring assemble in the present electrical generators,
       Over-Unity output is   achievable  in  a  matter  of  hours.   These
       additional elements are to collect  (scavenge) the collapsing fields
       (C.E.M.F.) of both  the  armatures  and  field  coils   of   present
       electrical generator sets.   Present  electrical  generator  designs
       throw away this tremendous amount  of  valuable electrical energy in
       the form of C.E.M.F..

       On the armature/exciter element, install a second set  of brushes or
       sliprings, the exact  amount  behind  the  driver  units  needed  to
       collect the C.E.M.F. of the armature's  field  collapse,  to take it
       out of the system for utility.  On the field coils system, install a
       second set of  brushes/slip  rings,  the  exact  amount  behind  the
       original primary field coil system needed to collect the C.E.M.F. of
       the field coils' collapsing fields for utility when taken out of the
       unit.

       The additional new  C.E.M.F.  outputs  can be phased to the original
       output system in the load wiring.  These modifications far more than
       doubled the generator's output power  at  small  modification costs,
       and at no  increase  in  operating  costs.   This   general   design
       modification allows almost  any  currently  manufactured  electrical
       generator set to  be an Over-unity  design.   With  some  additional
       external modifications, a  self  running  or stand alone  Over-unity
       configuration can be   achieved   on   most   commercial  electrical
       generators.  As most manufactured  electric  motors can be made into
       electrical generators the above type of modification  can be done to
       these electrical motors.
