                           SIMPLE PARTICLE BEAM WEAPONRY

                                        by

                               Robert L. Clark, Ph.D

       There are gross exaggerations and cunning lies in the current
       technical literature and lectures as to the complexity of Particle
       Beam  Weapons.    The  false  assertions  in  regard  to  the  great
       complexity of the Particle Beam Weapon, are necessary to justify the
       enormous sums spent on research and development.  For a good
       understanding  of  the  basis  theoretical  and  design  aspects  of
       Particle Beam Systems, readers are encouraged to obtain the book,
       Awesome Life Force by Joseph Cater.  To order it, send $16 postpaid
       to:
                         Tri-State Press
                         PO Box 150

       The average person with only two straight, highly polished strips of
       metal and a sunny day can make a Particle Beam System.  The strips
       can be any length but to begin, try strips about 10 inches long and
       about one inch wide.  The two metal strips must be highly polished -
       or better - chrome plated, to make excellent first surface mirrors.
       The two metal strips are placed slightly apart and parallel to each
       other, held slightly off-perpendicular to the earth with top opening
       aimed at the sun.  Extreme care must be taken as to where the bottom
       beam exit is aimed.  At addition of inexpensive optics on the light
       input end of this device greatly increases the power of your
       Particle Beam System.

       A high intensity artificial light source (strobe light or photo
       flash is excellent) may also be used to input the device in place of
       the sun, making a portable, practical Particle Beam System.  The
       variations in design and utility are endless.

       After you have completed this simple experimental unit, you will
       never again be taken in by the foolishness and lies of supposed
       complexity of Particle Beam Systems.
