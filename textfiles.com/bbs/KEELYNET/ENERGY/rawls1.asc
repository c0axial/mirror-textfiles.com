                                Triune Force Flows

       In our various studies, we always keep in mind the claims of John W.
       Keely.  One of  these  studies  is into the work of Albert Roy Davis
       and Walter Rawls, pioneer researchers  into  the effects of magnetic
       fields, particularly those deemed "mono-polar".

       The basic effect they discovered (and which is not  credited to them
       even today) is that North Pole and South Pole magnetic energy has
       an exactly opposite spin as well as EFFECTS.

       Specifically, North Pole   energies   cause  mass  to  contract  and
       condense while South  Pole  energies   cause   mass  to  expand  and
       dissipate.  Also, North Pole energies have alkaline properties while
       South Pole energy is acid.

       Since magnetic monopole magnets are not available at  just  any Wal-
       Mart store, they  chose  to use the longest possible bar or cylinder
       magnets which would allow for the  greatest  separation  of  the two
       opposite energies.

       It was found  that  use of a North Pole would provide  an  energetic
       environment which would  cause cancer cells to contract and die out.
       This energetic environment also has  other  healthy  applications as
       detailed in their many books.

       I had the pleasure of visiting with Walter Rawls  one  afternoon  at
       his office in   Jacksonville,   Florida   several  years  back.   We
       discussed many things including Keely, of which he had never heard.

       During that meeting, I made reference  to  the picture now listed as
       RAWLS1.GIF here on KeelyNet and specifically Keely's  idea  that ALL
       FORCE FLOWS consisted of 3 separate flows.

       If you will  note,  the  magnetic field pattern takes on the form of
       ropes of force which have triune points similar to tetrahedrons.

       Walter was surprised that anyone had  noticed  that and we went into
       some detail as  to  Keely's  claims.   He  was quite  impressed  and
       indicated that there were several interesting anomalies which he and

       Davis had discovered  yet  which  were  not  published.   These were
       considered proprietary information which he could not discuss.

       Needless to say, my curiosity was  peeked  yet  he  would not budge.
       Despite that, Keely  says that these three forces were  HARMONICALLY
       related and a proper understanding of these relationships would show
       how a variety  of effects could be produced, ranging from levitation
       to disintegration to instantaneous explosions.

       (Note this was discovered and applied  in  Keely's  lab from 1872 to
       1898, long before Einstein, Quantum Physics, Dirac, QED, etc.)

       The RAWLS1.GIF image is one we have wanted to place  on KeelyNet for
       some time now  to  further  illuminate  the  many cross correlations
       regarding Keely's claims and which  we  find  from so many disparate
       sources.
