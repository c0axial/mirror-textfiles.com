Micro-cavitation fusion, or luke-warm fusion

Nobody knows WHY cold nuclear fusion works, or even if it does. Conventional
theory does not cover it, and the ones invented to explain it do not work.

O.k, fine, so heres one that does, maybe.

I have a friend who does reaserch for the MOD, on subs etc.  He showed me a
paper on cavitation.  It was also mentioned on Tomorrows World apparently.

Cavitation is when you get bubbles forming in a violently stirred liquid, for
those who don't know. This effect occurs around submarine propellors at depths
of about 300 ft or lower, i.e., at pressures of 10 atmospheres.

It can also be produced at 1 atmosphere (up here at the surface - 14.7 psi at
sea level), by pushing an ultrasound frequency into a sealed container of
liquid.  Water is best. This has been known for ages, since 1952.

What is new is that these bubbles glow in the dark.  Dimly blue. Each bubble
is aproximately 1 to 3 microns in diameter, it depends on the wavelength.

What my friend was doing was studying the energy inside them, with a veiw to
preventing it, (he didn't say why, MOD stuff). It turns out that the bubbles
glow becuase the energies involved produce a plasma inside as they collapse.

This collapsing bubble is at temperatures and pressures equal to or greater
than at the core of the sun!

Research into the experimental set-ups used in cold-fusion show that most used
magnetic stirrers which produce small amounts of ultrasound, and some did not.

I made a small set-up using a glass tube, and an ultrasound transducer. The
end cap was positively charged to attract free electrons. The inital run with
plain water heated it no more than expected, i.e. slightly less energy out
than in.

The next used heavy water, plus dissolved deuterium gas, with results which
were a little more dramatic. The equipment was activated in one second bursts,
in case of radiation production.

In approximately 1/10 of a second enough energy was liberated to vaporize the
water, causing a large steam explosion.  Also sufficent light to blind me
temporarily.  There was no detectable radiation.  Upon later thought I
theorised that the oxygen atoms were acting as neutron absorbers, and the
surrounding water coped(sp?) with the gamma.

Since I am currently in dire financial straits, would anyone care to follow up
on this. It is to important (that it not) be forgotten due to accident.

I suggest a modified internal combustion engine would work. The air intake
converted to a water intake, with the fuel injector acting as a gaseous
deuterium injector. The spark-plug would be replaced with an ultra-sound
transducer (speaker).

Basically a fusion powered steam engine.  N.B, conventional gas plasma
theories of fusion still apply, its how the plasma is created that's weird!
