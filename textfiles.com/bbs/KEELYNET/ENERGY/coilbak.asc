       Author    :  Joel McClain

       Date      :  August 6, 1993

       Theory of Operation

       COILBAK is a simple circuit consisting of an astable  oscillator and
       an inverting comparator.   The  output  of  the  astable  is used to
       energize a 6VDC relay, as well as  to  supply the inverting input to
       the comparator.

       SCR1 is normally ON.  As the output of the astable  RISES, the relay
       is energized.  When the astable output rises above reference (9VDC),
       the comparator output goes LOW, disabling SCR1.

       The inductive "kick",  which is a HIGH NEGATIVE SPIKE, is discharged
       to the storage battery negative terminal,  via  steering  diode  D2.
       The storage battery absorbs the spike, and couples  the  net voltage
       increase to the supply battery.

       The aggregate energy  of  the spike as it discharges will EXCEED the
       energy required to produce it, given the following conditions :

          1.  the sawtooth frequency is adjusted  to  energize the relay in
              the LEAST possible time.


                                      Page 1





          2.  the  reference  voltage  is  OPTIMIZED to provide an adequate
              relay CHARGE TIME at the LEAST possible DISCHARGE time.

          3.  a high conductive path, (i.e.  LARGE  GAUGE WIRE) is provided
              from D2 to the STORAGE battery.

       The net effect  of optimizing the above is to achieve  an  aggregate
       circuit resonance.  It   is   based   upon  the  GRAY  motor,  which
       substituted electromagnets FOR THE  RELAY,  and which was capable of
       powering an automobile.

       This circuit is  an  above-unity  voltage  source, allowing  surplus
       energy to be  tapped from the supply battery.  It may be possible to
       substitute large values of capacitance  for  the batteries, provided
       that the tapped energy does not exceed the level required to sustain
       circuit operation.

       Each circuit must BE TUNED for its OPTIMUM POINT, which  consists of
       varying the sawtooth  frequency  and adjusting the reference voltage
       for the LARGEST SPIKE with the SHORTEST discharge time.

       Improvements may include pull-up networks  (resistor + diode) on the
       op-amp outputs, to   avoid  "float",  if  that  affects   operation.
       Removing the cover of the relay will allow more air around the coil,
       which is necessary to optimize the spike amplitude.

       The GRAY motor was able to vary speed in intervals, based upon even-
       order harmonics of  the resonant circuit frequency.  Once you attain
       optimum gain from the circuit, you  may  want  to try this, as well.
       However, the GRAY  motor  also  had  inertial  momentum  to  sustain
       rotation above the  starting  point  while increasing speed, and the
       relay does not have this advantage.

       What GRAY realized is that there is NO SUCH THING AS A DC MOTOR!
       In a motor which is energized by a  non-flucutating  voltage source,
       the inductive kick from the electromagnets is consumed  as  heat  in
       the windings.  The   CURRENT,  if  viewed  on  an  oscilloscope,  is
       alternating, based upon  the EMF  (electro-motive  force)  and  CEMF
       (counter electro-motive force)  of  the inductive path.   Therefore,
       providing a discharge  path  will  permit  recapture  of  energy and
       reduce heat.  His  motors  ran  very   cool.    Using  the  resonant
       frequency of the electromagnets at peak allowed him  to  stress  the
       barrier and increase  output  energy,  much the same as with a Tesla
       coil, which produces several times the input power in the secondary.
       The key is resonance on both types of devices.

       In retrospect, the spike which COILBAK  is  "recycling"  has  ALWAYS
       BEEN considered a  nuisance  in  relay  logic circuits,  as  it  can
       puncture the oxide  barrier  in  CMOS  devices  which share a signal
       ground path with the relays.  It is  typically suppressed or steered
       back into the  relay coil by diode, to dissipate  it.   All  we  are
       doing is saving the spike energy, which EXCEEDS input at resonance.

       The "aether" as it is called, or the air around us, or the vacuum in
       a vacuum tube,  is  replete  with  primary  and  harmonic energy, at
       levels which ARE INCALCULABLE!  Stressing  the barrier with ANY form
       of energy will  produce  gains  above unity.  Keely  did  this  with
       sound, and Tesla  did  it  with  electricity.  Gray did it with EMP.
       COILBAK does it using the GRAY model, with some modification.  If

                                      Page 2





       you are familiar  with  inductor  theory,  you  know that there is a
       phase lag of 90 degrees, before current begins to flow.

       COILBAK is de-energizing the coil  by cutting off the voltage supply
       at the point where EMF has ATTAINED MAXIMUM, but no longer.  Current
       is not allowed to be wasted as heat, but is delimited  as  CEMF in a
       low resistance to the storage battery.

       Vangard Note

           You will  note  the  use  of  several interesting points in this
           file.  Specifically,  Joel's  use  of  the  term  "an  aggregate
           circuit resonance"  correlates with one of the discoveries  made
           by John  Keely  in the late 1800's.  The file NEUTRAL1 gives the
           basis for much of this principle of aggregation.

           Essentially, each atom has a fundamental  frequency, each bundle
           of atoms forms a molecule which has a fundamental  frequency  in
           addition to  all the "bundled" atomic frequencies and so all the
           molecules when  aggregated  (bundled)   together   form  a  mass
           resonant frequency.  Such an aggregation of frequencies  can  be
           so manipulated as to become a harmoniously resonating
           structure, that  is  all  the parts work together with the LEAST
           possible interference.

           Keely refers  to  the  construction   of   devices   that   were
           "differentiated" or tuned to REMOVE any KNOTS  or  KINKS  in the
           material.  Removal  of  these  kinks  would provide for a "pure"
           flow of force THROUGH the structure.   This was done in much the
           same way that magnets or electrets are now formed.

           One or  more  frequencies  are injected into  a  hot  or  molten
           structure, and  allowed to influence the cooling structure.  The
           Chladni vibrating waveplate is  a  graphic  illustration of what
           actually goes on.

           The various frequencies cause the mass to take on the form of
           a 3  dimensional  "map"  of  the  injected  signature  and  thus
           polarizes the  mass structure to some extent.  This polarization
           literally creates a physical imprint of the injected patterns.

           When considered in this light,  we  can  see  how  a mass can be
           "tuned" to respond to specific frequencies which  in  turn leads
           to other possibilities that go beyond the scope of this paper.

           Such tuning  can  be  made  to  be  harmonious (constructive) or
           enharmonious (destructive) and  when  made as perfectly resonant
           as possible,  the  structure  could  directly interface  to  the
           hyperspace (virtual) field.

           This applies to circuits or objects such as a chair, rock, etc.
           And since all these frequencies working in conjunction form what
           is termed  the  "signature",  one  can  get  an  idea  of how to
           manipulate mass for specific phenomena.

           So, if we consider pure resonance  as being analogically similar
           to a  super-conductor  (i.e.  no resistance), then  the  overall
           efficiencies of   such  a  resonant  structure  should  be  100%
           (perpetual motion or unity) OR GREATER (overunity or free

                                      Page 3





           energy) because  of  the "purity of flow" of any energy injected
           into it.

           This is again analogous to the  contentions  stated  in the file
           MAGICSQ, which deals with basic replicating patterns  that  work
           together in  a  harmonious  and  therefore  REINFORCING  overall
           matrix for the redirection of force or generation of phenomena.

           One of the questions that many  people  ask  is  where does this
           "free" energy  come from?  There are several ideas  about  this.
           Some say  it  is  the  jitter  of  all  atoms/molecules  that is
           entrained in a laser like fashion  to produce a directed energy,
           others say  it  is  a  stress impressed on the local  space/time
           field, while  yet  others  say it is a dimensional transfer from
           what is casually termed hyperspace.

           There are  other,  more conventional  forms  of  "free"  energy,
           including solar, thermodynamic (heat pump) systems,  geothermal,
           wavepower, windpower,  cold  fusion,  etc.,  and these are quite
           valid and much easier to practically achieve.

           Many consider the quest for overunity or scalar type free energy
           to be in search of a "perpetual  motion device".  This could not
           be further from the truth.  Perpetual motion occurs naturally in
           all atoms,  simply  from the rotation of the electron(s)  around
           the proton/nucleus  and  the rotation of planets around the sun,
           so WHERE does THAT force come from?

           It is simply a matter of understanding the SOURCE of this energy
           and HOW TO TAP that source.   So,  the  researchers in this area
           discuss various theories and approaches, determine (in some very
           creative ways)  how  to  test  the  theories  in  a  circuit  or
           mechanical structure  and  keep  working at it.  There is little
           doubt that MANY OTHERS have actually  discoverd  how to tap this
           source, however,  they  have  become embroiled  with  investors,
           threatened by  vested  groups  or governments or a host of other
           reasons, and so many DIED with the secret.

           One thing  we  all  hear  is  sarcastic  remarks  regarding  our
           interests and researches in free energy and other  "alternative"
           studies.  There  are  SO  many  who  are  SO brainwashed and not
           willing to try to think for themselves.  It serves no purpose to
           get into dissipative dialogues with these people.

           The information is available and  most of us will freely discuss
           any questions  that  "outsiders" or "neophytes"  have  in  these
           areas.  That  is  about  the  best  we  can do UNTIL the working
           machines are OUT and suddenly, all the doubters will jump on the
           bandwagon, claiming to have been  "supporters"  all along.  Just
           so.

           The ONLY way such devices will EVER see practical  use  and with
           the minimum of CONTROL, is through the computer networks such as
           InterNet, CompuServe and KeelyNet functioning in a sourcing
           role coupled  with  the  OPEN  SHARING  OF  INFORMATION  as Joel
           McClain, Floyd Sweet, William Hyde and many others have done.

           This way, when the plans are discovered  and FREELY SHARED, they
           will be passed onto the much larger global systems as fast as

                                      Page 4





           humanly possible, and from there, downloaded, printed and copied
           for distribution  to  the  hundreds  of  thousands of people who
           study such subjects (and all this done at MINIMAL cost).

           There is little question that  we  are  all  being  monitored by
           governments AND large corporations, indeed, it  would  be STUPID
           of them  NOT  to  monitor our actions.  When the actual machines
           are built  and  used,  it  will  change  the  world  in  a  most
           disruptive way,  however,  change is necessary  for  growth  and
           society is notoriously ADAPTIVE.

           We foresee practical free energy devices in the next 2 years, IF
           NOT SOONER.  Joel  is  an inspiration in this respect because he
           not only experiments but openly shares his work.

           Some have questioned why such information should be freely GIVEN
           to people who have made no expenditures of either time or money.

           We understand the feeling and  to  some  degree  concur with it,
           however, such  an  attitude  serves  to quench  the  sharing  of
           information which  will  logically  lead  to  practical  working
           devices.  And since the END RESULT  we are ALL seeking is to see
           and USE  our  own personal free energy machine  (for  starters),
           then we cannot accept or support such an attitude.

           We too   have   LONG   SUFFERED   the  lifting  of  information,
           distribution of material at our  own  cost  and other activities
           that EXPECTED  some  people to be TAKERS and not  SHARERS.   So,
           there are snakes in the grass and we must just live with it as a
           part of the lower human nature.

           So, the  best  thing  we  can all do is freely share information
           such as  this file, pass it  around  to  your  own  friends  and
           contacts and  don't worry about the USERS.  Each  of  us  has  a
           higher purpose and plays a part in a larger plan.

           Should you  choose  to experiment in this area, we would GREATLY
           APPRECIATE your sharing of your  findings  or improvements, etc.
           There are   SO  MANY  people  who  would  actively   carry   out
           experiments if  they  had  a  clue  as  to  how  to approach the
           problem.  This file is an excellent  starter and your input will
           only help to accelerate the INEVITABLE development of practical,
           duplicatable free energy machines.  Imagine what  a  world would
           come from this!  THANKS.....................>>>  Jerry
