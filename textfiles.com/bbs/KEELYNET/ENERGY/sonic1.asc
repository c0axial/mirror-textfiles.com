       Ultrasonics is the  term used to describe the study of all soundlike
       waves whose frequency is above the range of normal human hearing.

       Audible sound frequencies  (see SOUND  AND  ACOUSTICS)  extend  from
       about 30 to 20,000 hertz (1 Hz = 1 cycle per second).

       The actual waves and the vibrations producing them are called
       ultrasound. As late  as  1900  ultrasound was still  a  novelty  and
       studied only with  a  few  specially  made  whistles; by 1930 it had
       become an interesting but small area of physics research.

       In the 1960s and '70s, however, it became an important research tool
       in physics, a  far-ranging  instrument   for   flaw   detection   in
       engineering, a rival to the X ray in medicine, and a reliable method
       of underwater sound-signaling.

       The range of frequencies available has been extended to millions and
       even billions of hertz (megahertz and gigahertz).

                            Generation of Ultrasonics

       The principal modern  sources  of  ultrasound  are   specially   cut
       crystals of materials  such  as  quartz  or  ceramics such as barium
       titanate and lead zirconate.

       The application of an alternating electrical voltage across the
       opposite faces of  a plate made  of  such  a  material  produces  an
       alternating expansion and contraction of the plate  at the impressed
       frequency.

       This phenomenon in  crystals,  known  as PIEZOELECTRICITY, was first
       discovered in the 1880s by Paul-Jacques and Pierre Curie.

       If the frequency of alternation f  is such that f = c/2l, where c is
       the speed of  sound  in the material and l is the thickness  of  the
       plate, the size  of  the  alternating  expansions  and  contractions
       becomes very large, and the plate is said to exhibit RESONANCE.

       Similar effects are observed in ceramics.  Ceramic  objects have the
       added advantage of  being  able to be cast in the  form  of  plates,
       rings, cylinders, and  other  special shapes that are convenient for
       engineering applications.

       In addition, some   materials,  such  as  cadmium  sulfide,  can  be
       deposited in thin films on a solid  medium.  Such  material can then
       serve as a transducer.

       Still other ultrasonic  transducers  are  produced in  ferromagnetic
       materials by varying the magnetic-field intensity in the material.

                                 Wave Properties.

       Ultrasonic waves travel through matter with virtually the same speed
       as sound waves--hundreds  of  meters per second in air, thousands of
       meters per second  in solids, and  1,500  m/sec  (5,000  ft/sec)  in
       water.

       Most of the properties of sound waves (reflection,  refraction,  and
       so forth) are also characteristic of ultrasound.

       The attenuation of   sound   waves  increases  with  the  frequency,
       however, so that ultrasonic waves  are  damped far more rapidly than
       those of ordinary sound.

       For example, an ultrasonic wave of 1 MHz frequency  passing  through
       water will lose  half  of  its intensity over a distance of 20 m (66
       ft) through absorption of the energy  by  the  water;  in  air,  the
       distance over which  the  intensity falls by half  would  be  a  few
       centimeters.

       At the audio frequency of 20,000 Hz, the corresponding distances for
       water and for  air  would  be about 50 km (30 mi) and 5 m (16.5 ft),
       respectively.

       In addition to waves that travel through  the bulk of a material, it
       is also possible to send waves along the surface of a solid.

       These waves, called Rayleigh waves, can be produced  and detected by
       minute metallic "fingers"    deposited   on   the   surface   of   a
       piezoelectric substrate. Techniques  utilizing  surface  waves  have
       been widely exploited in signal processing.

                                   Applications.

       Perhaps the most  widespread  use  of ultrasound  has  been  in  the
       detection of obstacles  in  materials  that  do  not  transmit light
       (optically opaque materials).

       Thus, ultrasound is  used in underwater  signaling  because  a  low-
       frequency ultrasonic beam can penetrate many kilometers of the ocean
       and be reflected back from any obstacle.

       This is the  principle  of  SONAR,  which  can be used  to  identify
       submarines and map  the  ocean  bottom.  Sonar  can  even be used to
       measure the thickness of ice packs by submarines traveling under the
       polar ice caps.

       If a short pulse of ultrasound is  sent  into  a  metal,  it will be
       reflected from any  cracks or minute defects such  as  blowholes.  A
       system generating such  pulses  is  widely used in flaw detection in
       solids (nondestructive testing).

       Because different solids and liquids reflect at different rates, the
       reflection of an  ultrasonic  pulse  can  also  be  used  in medical
       examinations, especially of unborn  fetuses, and in the detection of
       brain tumors and breast cancers.

       Echocardiography, the study of heart motions by ultrasonic means, is
       another medical application.  An  important  physical   property  of
       ultrasound is the  vigorous small-scale vibration of the medium that
       it represents.

       This property has   led  to  many   industrial   applications.   The
       vibrations can be  used to shake dirt or other deposits  off  metals
       (ultrasonic cleaning). Such vibrations can also be used in soldering
       or welding.

       The ultrasonic transducer  serves  to  remove  oxide  from the outer
       surface of the material, making more  efficient  the  use of heat in
       the joining process. Plastic powders can be molded into small
       cylinders by similar techniques.
