       While discussing a  variety  of subjects with a friend last week, we
       broached the topic of invisibility.   He  said  he had a paper which
       showed a photograph of a bat which had been immersed in a fluid
       to cause the tissues to become transparent.

       The photograph was a photocopy and showed the skeleton  of  a bat as
       seen through the now clear tissues.

       The formula for this fluid is :

                           1 part  - Benzyl Benzoate
                           3 parts - Salicylic Methyl Ester

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       To induce Invisibility in matter, we can use any of three techniques
       to accomplish that end.  They are listed in order of probability.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

          1)   Bending  light  around  the object so that it cannot contact
               the object and thus reflect back to the viewer

       This principle takes advantage of  the  Refractive  Index of a mass.
       All matter either reflects, diffuses or transmits light  (indeed all
       radiation) to varying degrees based on its Refractive Index.

       Refraction refers specifically   to   the  change  in  direction  of
       radiation, especially light,  or  sound  frequencies  as  it  passes
       obliquely from one medium to another medium resulting in a different
       propagation velocity.

       This change in the velocity (speed and direction) of the wave causes
       a corresponding change  in  the  effective  wavelength,   thus   the
       frequency of the radiation changes WHILE MOVING WITHIN THE MEDIUM.

       The degree of change is thus the Refractive Index.

       The Refractive Index  is  the  phase  velocity  of radiation if free
       space is divided by the phase velocity  of  the  same radiation in a
       specified medium.

       The absolute index  for  all  ordinary  transparent   substances  is
       greater than 1,  but  there are some special cases (X-rays and light
       in metal films) for which the index of refraction is less than
       unity (1).

       The absolute index for air exceeds  unity  by  less than 0.0003, the
       relative indices for solids and liquids in air are very nearly equal
       to their absolute indices.

       The Refractive Index VARIES WITH WAVELENGTH.  Because  of  this, the
       wavelength of Sodium light is used at 5.893 Angstroms.

               Air            -  1.0002926
               Carbon Dioxide -  1.00045
               Ice            -  1.31
               Water          -  1.333........at 20 degrees Celsius
               Glycerine      -  1.4729
               Rock Salt      -  1.516
               Glass          -  1.5 to 1.9
               Diamond        -  2.419

       Now, if a means of "bending" all incoming visible wavelengths around
       an object, it  would  become  invisible.  The movie "Predator" takes
       this approach in the cloaking device  which  the  alien  wears.   It
       could take the  form of a fiber optic mesh or an electronic  banding
       effect.

       If a high  field  density  magnetic  field is used, it would produce
       life altering effects on both the operator and the environment.


                                      Page 4





       A chemical is  possible  like  that used in the movie "the Invisible
       Man".  Hopefully the effect would  be  non-toxic and wear off as the
       body eliminated the sudden concentration over time.

       Gravity waves might  cause  such  an  effect  if   they   could   be
       successfully harnessed.

       As of now,  we  know of no light-bending technique which has worked.
       It is always possible that some researcher  or  group of researchers
       has achieved this and is keeping it quiet.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

          2)   Shifting to a higher form of energy which cannot  be seen by
               the viewer because of its being emitted by the test object

       There is mention of a technique in one of the UFO related books.  It
       involves the stimulation  of a mass to a frequency in either the IR,
       UV or higher frequencies.

       There are several interesting points  when  looking  at it from this
       angle.

       UltraViolet (UV) light sucks heat from the body while  InfraRed (IR)
       light projects heat into the body.

       If all visible light reflected from an object could be stepped up to
       a doubling or  a harmonic outside the bounds of the visible spectrum
       (this could be either Ultra or Infra),  then the object would appear
       as a black hole in the shape of the object.

       If IR was  used,  then the object would give off heat.   If  UV  was
       used, people in  the presence of the operator would experience burns
       and conjunctivitis (burning, reddening and swelling of the eyes).

       Many UFO close  encounters have  as  a  physical  side  effect,  the
       burning of the  skin  and  eye  swelling.   This  indicates  a  high
       proportion of UV or other higher radiation.

       To cause the  body  to emit frequencies beyond the visible spectrum,
       one could use a super-heterodyne effect  or some form of doubling or
       tripling.

       Crystals could be  used  for achieving the doubling.   While  super-
       heterodyning would be  accomplished  by  the blending of two or more
       frequencies to generate both the sum and difference frequencies.

       I don't see how this technique could  work  if the sole result is to
       delineate a black human shape.  The invisibility would  be  defeated
       since the object would be so obvious, if not totally conspicuous.

       There is the possibility that there are principles of light which we
       don't completely understand.

       This could be   especially   true   at   UV,  IR  and  other  unseen
       frequencies.

       For that reason, this possible technique should be looked into.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

          3)   Dimensional shifting of the object itself

       If the object  could  be  so  "excited"  as to translate to a higher
       dimension or level  of  being, then  it  would  effectively  not  be
       respondent to radiations, including light, from this dimension.

       From experiments we have heard of, this doesn't appear to be true.

       One case which we can only give in a very abbreviated  form  at  the
       request of our  source,  involved  certain  experiments  using  high
       density fluctuating magnetic fields.

       A device was built in the shape  of  a  split-phase  coil  with many
       turns of wire.

       When the subject sat astraddle the coil and the power  was  applied,
       at certain frequencies and magnetic field densities, the subject saw
       the room slowly vanish to be displaced by other scenery.

       Further experiments caused  the  subject  and  the  coil to begin to
       VANISH FROM THE TEST AREA.  (kind of reminds you of the Philadelphia
       Experiment, HUH?)

       The subject obviously  "translated"   to  a  higher  dimension  both
       visually and physically.

       Now, this might not be the rule for all such experiments.  There  is
       of course, much   work  to  be  done  using  different  frequencies,
       combinations of such and field densities.

       It might be  possible  to cause a  "vanishing"  without  losing  the
       physical form.

       One of the  communications given to UFO contact Billy  Meier  stated
       that the Pleidians  used  a  time  shifting technique.  This allowed
       them to vanish and reappear in another location almost instantly.

       They said time could be divided  into  many  separate  and  distinct
       moments, each of  which  could house an entire Universe  CO-EXISTENT
       with ours, yet TOTALLY UNKNOWN AND SUSPECTED BY US.

       Perhaps this theory explains how UFO's, Bigfoot, Loch Ness and other
       anomalies occur in   our   reality.   They  are  simply  momentarily
       "displaced" entities from another dimension.

       It would follow that phase conjugate  techniques  could  be  used to
       energize an area  to  a  level  of  very  high  field  density.   If
       something walked into  that field as it "scanned" another dimension,
       it could be "charged" to forcibly drag it into our dimension.

       When this occurs,  the  being is  disturbed  and  confused  by  this
       seemingly "magical" accident.

       As time progressed, the energy charge would fade away and the entity
       would reach the quantum level necessary to cause the return to their
       home dimension.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       We hear many stories and some experiments which in many cases we are
       forbidden to pass on in their entirety.

       Part of the reason is trust coupled with a desire to have a sounding
       board leading to  other  approaches.  Another reason is that someone
       else might know in the event of catastrophe.

       Although we cannot always spell out  the  details, many of the files
       on KeelyNet are laced with annotated information.

       We are most appreciative of everyone who shares with us and others.

       Not only does it increase our understanding and perspective  of  our
       reality, but through it, we can hopefully help others to understand.

       Of course, application is everything.  So, BUILD, TEST, REFINE, PASS
       IT AROUND!
