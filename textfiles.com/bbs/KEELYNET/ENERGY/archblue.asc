This is highly similar to the 1935 Dallasite, 'Dad' Garrett and his Hydrolytic
Carburetor, all detailed in the file GARRETT1.ZIP as researched by and listed
on KeelyNet.  The vehicle was driven around White Rock Lake using 1 gallon of
water from the lake.  It was later driven all over Dallas with no problems or
engine damage to the 4 cylinder engine.

Hydrogen in internal combustion engines

This is a translation of an article that appeared in the magazine "IMPLOSION"
in german language, in 1983. The title of the article is

                          WATER - FUEL OF THE FUTURE?

and I would like to make this information available as it describes one of the
simplest methods of separating water into hydrogen and oxygen for use as fuel
in an internal combustion engine, with an expenditure of electrical energy
much inferior to the energy content of the hydrogen gas obtained.

Here is the text of the article:

Almost all drivers have made the experience that the motor runs better when it
rains. This is also a reason why our parents sprayed coal with water to make
it burn better. Therefore it is no wonder that for years some drivers have
used a kind of water spray injector, which is very simple.

It is a container of plastic or glass, which can be closed airtight. A thin
pipe with an acquarium valve leads through the top cover down close to the
bottom of the container.

A second pipe enters only about 5 cm into the container from the top cover and
is connected with the carburetor or the air filter. The container is filled
with water to just below the level of the second pipe.

The suction of the carburetor pulls air through the water in the container and
so adds hydrogen and oxygen to the gas mixture, which results in a lowered
consumption of gasoline.

This simple mechanism was improved by the New Zealand inventor Archie Blue
with some additions so that the water vapor alone can run an internal
combustion engine, without gasoline. It runs about 40 km with 1 liter of
water.

His American patent (number 4,124,463) is so simple that anyone with
mechanical skills can produce it. On the non-metallic air pipe that enters the
container, are mounted at equidistant intervals eight corrosion free round
metallic plates, which have been perforated with numerous holes.  They are
electrified alternately with positive and negative DC voltage from the car
battery (12 Volt, 2-3 Amp).

The resulting electrolysis separates the water into oxygen and hydrogen which
attach to the metal plates in small bubbles. The air bubbles forced through
the water by the suction of the carburetor take those small bubbles of
hydrogen and oxygen with them to the top of the container.

The energy thus obtained is three times that of gasoline per weight. No
poisonous exhaust gases are produced because the end product of combustion is
water vapor.

The air needs only 4 % of enrichment with these gases to burn hotter and
faster than natural gas.

Warm water is easier to electrolyse and therefore a heating element is mounted
in the bottom of the container.

Note: I have not been able so far to obtain the original patent referred to in
the article, but would be interested in a copy if someone happens to get one.

Here an attempt to reproduce the design in ascii:
