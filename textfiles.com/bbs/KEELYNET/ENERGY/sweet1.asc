       Hello,

       I just received  in  ASCII form the two papers by Mr. Tom E. Bearden
       which appeared in the Proceedings  of  the  26th Intersociety Energy
       Conversion Engineering Conference,   August   4-9,   1991,   Boston,
       Massachusetts.  They can  be  found  in  volume  4  in  the  section
       entitled 'Advanced Energy Concepts'.  The titles are :

             "Utilizing Scalar Electromagnetics to Tap Vacuum Energy"
                  by Floyd Sweet and Tom E. Bearden (pp. 370-375)
                        (listed as SWEET1.ASC on KeelyNet)
                                        and
                  "On a Testable Unification of Electromagnetics,
                    General Relativity, and Quantum Mechanics"
               by Tom E. Bearden and Walter Rosenthal (pp. 487-492)
                        (listed as SWEET2.ASC on KeelyNet)

       Except for the unsupported conjectures  dealing  with  mind, thought
       and life, which  bring  his  results  almost  into the  metaphysical
       realm, I find  these  papers  to  be very intriguing and compelling.
       Thus, with the permission of Mr.  Bearden,  I  am  posting  them  to
       sci.physics and alt.sci.physics.new-theories.  (I'll  start with the
       paper "On a   Testable   Unification  of  Electromagnetics,  General
       Relativity, and Quantum Mechanics".)

       As you can see in the "Followup-To:"  line,  I  would  like  to  see
       discussion appear in alt.sci.physics.new-theories, since that is the
       most appropriate place  for  discussion.   If  your  site  does  not
       receive a.s.p.n., then  let me know, and I can send you summaries of
       whatever discussion follows (hopefully  a  lot).  Of course, if your
       site doesn't receive a.s.p.n, then ask your sysadmin  if it would be
       possible to receive it.

       BTW, Mr. Bearden  is  not (yet) on the net, but he has agreed to let
       me be a go-between, and I'll try  to  post  his comments on whatever
       discussion ensues.  I  encourage everybody to find  Whittaker's  two
       papers and Maxwell's  original  treatise  on  electromagnetic theory
       (see the papers for the exact citations) and to read them carefully.

       I hope you find these papers as intriguing  as  I  have.  If nothing
       else, it will help you to firm up your foundation of physics.

       Please, let's keep  an  open, yet critical mind, and let's not allow
       the discussion to develop into a flame war.

       came to me in Word 5.0 format, so I've had to do some editing).

                                     Abstract

       Unrecognized for what  it  was,  in  1903-1904  E.T.  Whittaker  (W)
       published a  fundamental,  engineerable theory of electrogravitation
       (EG) in two  profound  papers.   The  first  (W-1903) demonstrated a
       hidden bidirectional EM wave structure  in  the  scalar potential of
       vacuum, and showed  how  to produce a standing scalar  EM  potential
       wave -- the  same  wave discovered experimentally four years earlier
       by Nikola Tesla.

       W-1903 is a   hidden   variable    theory    that   shows   how   to
       deterministically curve the local and/or distant space-time using
       EM.

       W-1904 shows that   all   force   field  EM  can  be   replaced   by
       interferometry of two  scalar potentials, anticipating the Aharonov-
       Bohm effect by  55  years  and  extending  it  to  the  engineerable
       macroscopic world.

       W-1903 shows how  to  turn EM into G-potential, curve  local  and/or
       distant space-time, and  directly engineer the virtual particle flux
       of vacuum.


                                      Page 2





       W-1904 shows how  to  turn  G-potential  and curvature of space-time
       back into force-field EM, even at  a distance.  The papers implement
       Sakharov's 1968 statement  that  gravitation  is not  a  fundamental
       field of nature,  but  a  conglomerate  of other fields.  Separately
       applied to electromagnetics  (EM),   quantum   mechanics  (QM),  and
       general relativity (GR), an extended superset of each results.

       The three supersets  are  Whittaker-unified,  so  that  a  testable,
       engineerable, unified field  theory  is  generated.   EM, QM, and GR
       each contained a fundamental error  that  blocked  unification,  and
       these three errors  are explained.  The Schroedinger  potential  can
       also be structured and altered, indicating the direct engineering of
       physical quantum change.

       Recently Ignatovich has  pointed  out  this  hidden bidirectional EM
       wave structure in the Schroedinger  potential,  without  referencing
       Whittaker's 1903 discovery of the basic effect.  The  potential  for
       applying the new approach to explain the nature of mind and thought,
       and providing a  laboratory-testable  theory  for  them,  is briefly
       noted and indicative major references cited.  Some of the possible
       implications for physics and biology are pointed out.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Electromagnetics Has Foundations Difficulties

       There exists today a small but growing number of scientists who have
       become aware that the presently accepted  electromagnetic  theory is
       seriously flawed.  Shortcomings  in  the theory are  readily  cited.
                       (listed as THEORYBE.ASC on KeelyNet)

       For example, in  railgun  experiments the Lorentz force law has been
       falsified.  It was always an approximation,  and does not adequately
       approximate at high energies.  [ref. 1]

       Also completely contrary to orthodox EM theory, the  EM force fields
       are not primary  agents  at  all, but are effects produced in and on
       the physical system by the potentials.   As  an example, we cite the
       Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect,  which  proves that, even  in  the  total
       absence of the force fields, the potentials remain and can interfere
       at a distance  to  produce real effects in charged particle systems.
       [ref. 2]  The AB effect has been proven  to  the satisfaction of all
       but the most  diehard  skeptics. [ref. 3] However,  its  fundamental
       impact on the basic notions underlying classical EM theory continues
       to be ignored by all but a handful of scientists.

       These EM shortcomings were not present in the original quaternion EM
       theory by James  Clerk  Maxwell.  [ref.  4]   Indeed,  the  original
       Maxwell theory contains many things  that were mistakenly eliminated
       from the abbreviated vector theory formulated primarily by Heaviside
       and Gibbs, and to a lesser extent by Hertz. [ref. 5]  Further, these
       things that do not exist in conventional EM theory,  but  that exist
       in Maxwell's actual  quaternion  theory,  can  be  used in specially
       designed equipment, and the operation  of  that  equipment  will  be
       inexplicable by present-day   electromagnetic   theory.    AB-effect
       laboratory apparatuses are in fact rigorous demonstrations of such
       a statement.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Scalar Electromagnetics

       This can be even further explained and developed experimentally

                                      Page 3





       according to Whittaker's fundamental approach. [ref. 6]

       In a modern  sense,  in 1903/1904 Whittaker theoretically showed how
       to engineer the scalar potential  with  a  highly  dynamic,  hidden,
       bidirectional EM wave structure, to build hidden EM  vacuum  engines
       that are still  unsuspected  in  modern  physics today.  Much of the
       content of the fundamental 1959 Aharonov/Bohm  paper was anticipated
       in a different manner, and dramatically extended in an engineerable,
       testable fashion, by Whittaker's two papers.  At the  time, however,

       interpretation of Maxwell's  EM  theory was just slowly beginning to
       spread as the adopted model.  Also,  special  and general relativity
       and quantum mechanics   had   not   yet  been  born.    Accordingly,
       considering the scientific  understanding  of  the  day,  it was not
       possible for any scientist, even Whittaker  himself, to perceive the
       potential future impact  these  fundamental  papers  could  have  on
       sciences and technologies  not  yet  even  born.   Unfortunately, in
       later years Whittaker apparently never realized that his two earlier
       papers had such application to the modern unification problem.

       Indeed, up to the time of Whittaker's  death,  very  few  scientists
       even concerned themselves with the notion of unified fields.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Turning EM Energy Into G-Potential Energy

       In his 1903 paper Whittaker showed that a standing  scalar potential
       wave can be  decomposed into a special set of bidirectional EM waves
       that convolute into a standing scalar  potential  wave,  as shown in
       Figure 1.  As a corollary, a set of bidirectional EM  waves,  stress
       waves, can be  constructed  to form a standing scalar potential wave
       in space, as  shown in Figure 2.   Since  all  potentials  represent
       trapped energy density of vacuum, they are gravitational

       [Note, Figure 2 is too complicated to reproduce here in ASCII]

                                      Page 4

       in nature. [ref.  7]   Because it represents a "standing wave" whose
       magnitude represents the variation  in  the  local energy density of
       the vacuum, the  Whittaker  scalar  potential  wave   represents   a
       standing wave of variation in the local curvature of vacuum, sharply
       in contradiction to  the assumptions of present electromagnetics and
       general relativity. [ref. 8]  It also  represents a standing wave of
       the variation of the local gauge.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Turning G-Potential Back to EM

       The very next  year, Whittaker's second paper (cited  above)  showed
       how to turn  such  G-potential wave energy back into EM energy, even
       at a distance, by scalar potential  interferometry, anticipating and
       greatly expanding the Aharonov-Bohm effect.

       Indeed, Whittaker's second  paper  shows  that  the  entire  present
       force-field electromagnetics can  be  directly  replaced with scalar
       potential interferometry.  In other  words,  scalar  EM includes and
       extends the present  restricted vector subset of Maxwell's  original
       theory.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Engineering the Nucleus Directly

       Whittaker's work is  even  more  striking  when  one  realizes  that
       potentials are actually part of the  vacuum  itself.   They  pervade
       through the electron  shells  of  an  atom,  directly  reaching  the
       nucleus and centering on it.

       Gross external changes  (gradients;  force fields) of the potentials
       interact primarily with  the  electron  shells  of  the  atom.   The
       stabilized (persistent, gradient-free)      potential's      primary
       interaction is with the atomic nucleus.

       Specifically, the primary    interaction   between   the   infolded,
       internalized EM bidirectional   wave   structure   of   a  Whittaker
       potential is with  the atomic nuclei, rather than  with  the  atom's
       electron shells, because  in  the  standing Whittaker potential wave
       the local magnitude of the external potential is not changing.

       Whittaker has in  fact  shown  that  there  exists  an  unsuspected,
       hidden, internal EM  energy  exchange  channel  between   nuclei,  a
       channel where EM  energy  flows  bidirectionally, undetected by most
       modern detectors.

       Unlimited types of  Whittaker-structures  can  be  produced  in  the
       laboratory in the  form of deterministically structured  potentials;
       for the first   time,   the  direct  engineering,  structuring,  and
       manipulation of the  nuclear  potentials   themselves,   even   with
       miniscule EM power,  is  possible.   This  is  a new  capability  of
       exceptional importance and application.

       The Whittaker structuring in effect allows one to produce a "virtual
       grid" to place  in  the violent virtual particle flux (VPF) exchange
       of the local vacuum with the nucleus.   By  simply  holding the grid
       signal constant, gradually   the  nuclear  potential   itself   will
       substructure (activate) with the same structure.


                                      Page 5





       When the activating   ("charging")   potential   is   removed,   the
       activation of the nucleus will gradually  "decay" back to the normal
       structure.  Just as  one example, the binding energy  of  an  atomic
       nucleus is accessible and, theoretically, engineerable.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Whittaker Structuring Confirmed

       Recently Ignatovich has pointed out the hidden bidirectional EM wave
       structure in the   Schroedinger   potential,   without   referencing
       Whittaker's 1903 discovery of the basic effect. [ref. 9]

       Also, recently modern researchers,  working on acoustic missiles and
       with the scalar   acoustic   wave   equation,  have   "rediscovered"
       Whittaker's 1903 infolded  bidirectional  planar  waves  inside  the
       scalar wave. [ref. 10]  They do not  appear  to  have yet recognized
       its relevance to their work in electromagnetic missiles. [ref. 11]
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       STOCHASTIC ELECTRODYNAMICS

       Whittaker's paper takes  on a significant new meaning,  however,  in
       light of Sakharov's  1968  hypothesis  that  gravitation  is  not  a
       primary field, but is produced as  a result of interactions of other
       fields.  Together with   Whittaker's  structured   potential,   this
       implies that the  gravitational  aspects  of the nucleus can also be
       electromagnetically engineered.

       As a result  of  Sakharov's  hypothesis,   explosive   activity   in
       stochastic electrodynamics (SED)  has  shown  that many  fundamental
       parts of physics  are "already unified" in terms of electromagnetics
       and gravitation.  Evidence  continues   to   accumulate   that   the
       gravitational field may not be a primary field of nature, but a
       secondary or residual effect associated with other non-gravitational
       fields.

       [ref. 12]   Actually,  general  relativity  has  always  focused  on
       energy as the  thing  which really has gravitation.  Trapped energy,
       such as mass,  is  particularly   important.    But  since  mass  is
       essentially trapped EM  energy,  relativity has essentially  assumed
       Sakharov's hypothesis anyway, without stating it so explicitly.

       Further, GR considers  "the"  G-potential as a conglomerate of other
       things. [ref. 13]  It follows that the gradient of that conglomerate
       yields a force field which is also a conglomerate.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       G-Potential is Electromagnetic

       Starting from Sakharov's postulate,  to  the first order gravitation
       should be due  to  some  aspect of the EM field,  since  EM  is  the
       strongest and most  universal  force  normally  encountered  in  the
       macroscopic world experimentally, and since mass is already "trapped
       EM energy."  Thus Sakharov focused  attention upon the zero-point EM
       energy fluctuations (ZPF) of vacuum.

       Sakharov conjectured that the Lagrange function of  the  G-field  is
       generated by vacuum  polarization, due to fermions. [ref. 14]  Akama
       et al examined the potential generation  of  gravity as a collective
       excitation of fermion-antifermion pairs. [ref. 15]

       Haxlacher and Mottolo proved that space-time (ST) curvature can

       arise from the quantum fluctuations of pure gauge fields.  [ref. 16]
       Zee showed that  gravity  is generated as a symmetry-breaking effect
       in quantum field  theory  in  which   a  dynamical  scale-invariance
       breaking is postulated  to take place at energies  near  the  Planck
       mass. [ref.  17]

       Amati, Veneziano and  Yoshimoto  showed that in pre-geometric models
       the Einstein action  and  metric   may  be  generated  from  quantum
       fluctuations of matter fields. [ref. 18]

       A review of the exploding field was given by Adler,  with particular
       emphasis on the case of renormalizable field theories with dynamical
       scale-invariance breaking, in   which   the   induced  gravitational
       effective action is finite and calculable. [ref. 19]
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Puthoff's Important Contribution

       Recently Puthoff has applied the Sakharov viewpoint to significantly
       advance the stochastic electrodynamics  field.   He has successfully
       explained why the  atom's orbital electrons do not  decay  into  the
       nucleus, even though  by  conventional  EM theory each electron must
       constantly radiate EM energy, since  it  is  constantly accelerated.
       [ref. 20]

       He has also  shown  that gravitation can indeed be  regarded  as  an
       induced effect associated  with  zero-point  EM  fluctuations of the
       vacuum. [ref. 21]  He has also shown  a  feedback-derivation  of the
       source of the vacuum EM zero-point energy fluctuations  from quantum
       fluctuation motion of  particles  driven  by  the  ZPE.   [ref.  22]
       Quantum fluctuation motion of particles  and vacuum ZPE fluctuations
       are connected by  a causal, self-regenerating cosmological  feedback
       cycle.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Some Conclusions

       In light of  Whittaker's  EM structuring of the potential, there are
       several important conclusions to  be  taken  from  the important SED
       work since Sakharov's seminal suggestion, as follows:

            (1) In  stochastic  electrodynamics,  very  solid   theoretical
                foundation exists for electrogravitation.
            (2) The  vacuum EM ZPF may be regarded as causally connected to
                quantum mechanical particle  jitter (Zitterbewegung motion)
                and vice  versa,  though  the feedback mechanism  into  the
                virtual particle flux of vacuum is normally hidden by the
                large-scale integration   represented  by  any  macroscopic
                object or process.
            (3) The SED theoretical demonstration  of this hidden mechanism
                adds new emphasis on the rather neglected  hidden  variable
                theories.
            (4) In  some  fashion,  statistical  quantum  change is chaotic
                rather than  random, for  it  has  already  been  shown  by
                Puthoff that the vacuum ZPF fluctuations driving everything
                are totally deterministic.  It follows that, theoretically,
                hidden Whittaker  order already exists in  quantum  change,
                and quantum  change  must  be  already chaotic and at least
                partially deterministic.
            (5) It  follows  that  there   may   well   exist  engineerable
                mechanisms that can affect or manipulate quantum change.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Whittaker Potentials Are Engineerable

       What Whittaker has  described  in  his  1903  paper  is  a  standing
       electrogravitational wave, a standing wave in the local curvature of
       space-time itself, that can readily be constructed experimentally.

       This Whittaker standing potential  wave is precisely the new form of
       standing EM wave  that  Nikola  Tesla had experimentally  discovered
       being radiated from  a thunderstorm four years earlier, on the night
       of July 3-4, 1899, and which he recorded  in  his  Colorado  Springs
       Notebook on the morning of July 4, 1899.  [ref. 23]

       Further, Whittaker's paper directly implies that the hidden variable
       determinism shown by  Puthoff  to  be  driving  the   zero-point  EM
       fluctuations can also be engineered, both locally and at a distance.

       In short, Whittaker's  1903 paper shows how to turn electromagnetics
       into gravitational potential.  Unknowingly,  Whittaker  had  already
       shown the correct  engineering  way to unify EM and  G  fields,  and
       already falsified one  of  Einstein's  later primary GR assumptions,
       that the local space-time is never  curved,  in a testable manner, a
       decade before Einstein published his theory of general relativity.

       In the very  next  year,  1904,  Whittaker's  second  paper  (orally
       presented in 1903)  was published. [ref. 24]  In this little-noticed
       paper Whittaker shows    that     all    classical    force    field
       electromagnetics can be replaced by scalar EM potentials  and  their
       interferometry.

       Specifically, any EM  force  field  can  be  replaced  by two scalar
       potential fields and scalar interferometry.  The combination of this
       paper and the 1903 Mathematische Annalen paper not only includes the
       Aharonov-Bohm effect, but specifies  a testable method for producing
       a macroscopic and controlled Aharanov-Bohm effect, even at large
       distances. [ref. 25]
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       PRESENT ELECTROMAGNETIC THEORY IS INCOMPLETE

       As stated above,  Maxwell's  original  EM  theory   was  written  in
       quaternions, which are an extension to the complex number theory and
       an independent system   of   mathematics.    In   short,  since  the
       quaternion is a hypernumber, Maxwell's  theory  was  a  hyperspatial
       theory, not just  the  limited  three-dimensional  subset  that  was
       extracted and expressed  by  Heaviside  and  Gibbs  in  terms  of an
       abbreviated, incomplete vector mathematics. [ref. 26]
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Heaviside and Gibbs Curtailed Maxwell's Theory

       Oliver Heaviside was  a  brilliant,  self-taught  genius  who  never
       formally attained a university degree, and whose papers were printed
       in technical magazines  rather  than  scientific   journals.    When
       Maxwell published his  Treatise in 1873, Heaviside was just teaching
       himself differential equations.

       Heaviside's imagination was completely seized by Maxwell's book, and
       Maxwell forever became his hero.   However,  he had great difficulty
       with quaternions and could not completely tolerate them.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

                                      Page 8





       Electrogravitation Was Discarded

       A puzzled Heaviside   abhorred   the  quaternion,  since  it  linked
       together a scalar component and a  vector  component, or "apples and
       oranges," in his  view.   He  excised  the scalar component  of  the
       quaternion and excluded  the  hyperspatial  characteristics  of  its
       directional components, producing his much more limited vectors.

       To unite magnetics and electromagnetics, the simplest complex aspect
       of the quaternion  had  to  be restored  by  resorting  to  ordinary
       imaginary numbers.  These  machinations  to  the quaternion  theory,
       however, discarded its unified field theory aspects.

       In short, Heaviside  produced  a  very  practical, highly restricted
       subset that was  far  easier  to   engineer,   but   he   threw  out
       electrogravitation in the process.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Hatred of the Potential

       Heaviside hated the  potential because he did not  truly  understand
       it.  He stated  that it was "...mystical and should be murdered from
       the theory."  He conditioned generations of physicists and engineers
       to erroneously believe that the potential  was  just  a mathematical
       convenience, and had no actual physical realization.

       Indeed, most electrical  physicists  and  electrical  engineers  are
       still of that  erroneous persuasion today, even though the Aharonov-
       Bohm work has   long-since   falsified   such   a   position,   both
       theoretically and experimentally.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       The Quaternion Theory Was Already a Unified EM/G Theory

       The present author  has  previously  pointed  out   that   Maxwell's
       quaternion theory was  in  fact a unified theory of electromagnetics
       and gravitation, and that the scalar component of the quaternion was
       the electrogravitational part.  [ref. 27]

       That part was   discarded   by   Heaviside   and   Gibbs,   and   so
       electrogravitation no longer  appears  in the electromagnetics  that
       resulted from Heaviside's and Gibbs' surgery on Maxwell's quaternion
       theory.  Strong experimental   evidence   for   the   EG  nature  of
       Whittaker's scalar EM theory is planned  for  presentation  at  this
       conference. [ref. 28]
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       ELECTROGRAVITATION ALSO EXCLUDED FROM GENERAL RELATIVITY

       The electrogravitational effect was also erroneously  excluded  from
       Einsteinian general relativity  (GR).  Einstein unwittingly narrowed
       his general relativity to only a subset  of  an unrestricted general
       relativity of curved space-time, by excluding local curvature.  This
       GR error was  an indirect result of the fundamental  Heaviside/Gibbs
       omission error in classical electromagnetics.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Einstein's Gedankenexperiment

       Unfortunately, Einstein's view  of electromagnetics approximated the
       classical Heaviside/Gibbs view.    In   classical   EM  theory,  the
       electrical potentials,   which  actually  were  electrogravitational
       potentials, were already ignored as having no physical significance,

                                      Page 9





       and EM was  considered mutually exclusive to G.  Therefore, Einstein
       only considered the weak gravitational  force  due to the attraction
       of mass, in  developing  his  general  relativity theory  of  curved
       space-time.

       The G-force is  far  weaker than the E-force; for two electrons, for
       example, the attractive G-force between them is on the order of only
       10^-42 times as strong as their electrical E-force repulsion.  Thus
       the G-force is incredibly smaller than the EM force.

       If only the weak G-force is considered  for curving space-time, then
       there will never be an observable curvature except  in the immediate
       vicinity of a  very large mass, such as on the surface of the sun or
       near a star.

       Considering the weak G-force as the  agent  for  curvature, Einstein
       reasoned that  the  laboratory and the observer/scientist/instrument
       would never be on the surface of the sun or near a star.  Therefore,
       the local space-time,  where  the lab and the scientist/observer and
       his instruments are, would never  be  observably  curved.  The local
       space-time of the observer would always be flat.

       Unfortunately Einstein then overgeneralized his thought examination,
       and he stated   one  of  his  fundamental  postulates   of   general
       relativity as "The  local  space-time  is  always flat."  This is an
       erroneous overstatement.

       The postulate should be more correctly stated as follows: "The local
       space-time is always  flat, whenever  only  the  weak  gravitational
       force is used for the agent of curvature, and the  observer  is  not
       near a large collection of mass, such as a star."
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Corollary to the Corrected Postulate

       The two statements    of   the   postulate   differ   fundamentally.
       Einstein's overstatement of the postulate  does  not  allow  the far
       stronger EM force  to be used as an agent for local  curvature.   In
       effect, his own  postulate  excluded electromagnetics from curvature
       unity with gravitation, in his general relativity theory. [ref. 29]

       On the other hand, the corrected statement  of  the postulate admits
       the following corollary:

            "When a very strong force such as the electromagnetic  force is
             used for  the  agent of curvature, the local space-time may be
             curved, even  though  the   observer   is  not  near  a  large
             collection of mass, such as a star." [ref. 30]

       Regrettably, many of   Einstein's  modern  followers   have   raised
       Einstein's theory to  a  dogma,  and  have  vigorously  enforced his
       overstatement of the locally flat space-time. [ref. 31]

       In so doing, general relativity has  been  erroneously  reduced to a
       theory that is basically not experimental:

             A priori, if the local space-time is flat,  then  there  is no
             local experiment  or local apparatus that involves or yields a
             curved space-time where the  laboratory,  the instruments, and
             the observer are located.

                                      Page 10





       In this fashion  the  universities  have continued to perpetuate the
       exclusion of electrogravitation and  its direct space-time curvature
       engineering implications.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       THE CURTAILMENT OF QUANTUM MECHANICS

       Today, quantum mechanics is our most successful physics theory.  Its
       predictions, even the eery prediction of action at  a distance, have
       been proven time  and time again.  However, quantum mechanics theory
       is known to have a formidable foundations  difficulty:   Try as they
       will, quantum physicists  cannot  find  chaos  in the  theory.   The
       theory is known  to be wrong unless it possesses chaos (hidden order
       inside its statistics), yet the best  efforts  of quantum physicists
       have failed to find it. [ref. 32]
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Chaos Excluded By Inherent Assumption

       Any well-founded mathematical discipline is totally  implied  by its
       foundations postulates, and  that  is true of quantum mechanics.  If
       the best efforts of the ablest physicists  of  the  day  cannot find
       chaos in the present QM, then one may suspect that  the  present  QM
       does not contain  chaos  (hidden  order), but already excludes it in
       some fashion.  If that is true,  then  some  present  QM  postulate,
       either explicit or implicit, of QM must be the culprit.

       If so, the  "real"  QM needed is a superset that has  at  least  two
       subsets: one (the  missing) subset includes chaos, while the present
       subset excludes chaos.

       So we may suspect that one or more  of the postulates of the present
       QM theory is in error or overly restrictive, and must  be changed to
       allow the missing chaotic subset.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Gibbs Statistics Excludes Hidden Order

       Indeed, we may  resolve  this  formidable QM problem quite simply by
       examining the statistics utilized by quantum mechanics.  When QM was
       being formulated, scientists simply  appropriated  and  included the
       thermodynamic statistics of  Willard  Gibbs  (the  same  Gibbs  who,
       together with Heaviside,  was  responsible for the highly restricted
       vector subset of Maxwell's theory of electromagnetics.).

       Gibbs' thermodynamics statistics was  totally based on the notion of
       the random variable.   That  is, the change (value  assumed  by  the
       variable in a specific instance) is not only totally statistical, it
       is also totally random.

       Quantum physicists assumed  a  postulate  of QM as follows: "Quantum
       change is totally statistical."  However, because of the Gibbs
       statistics, in application they interpreted that postulate in a much
       stronger fashion, as if it had been  stated  thusly: "Quantum change
       is totally statistical and random."

       The actual postulate and the presently applied interpretation  of it
       are in fact  two  quite different statements, and the interpretation
       is far more restrictive than actually implied by the postulate
       itself.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------


                                      Page 11





       The Random Interpretation Is False

       Further, the strong  interpretation can readily be falsified.  As an
       example, the macroscopic universe  is  simply  a  large  integration
       (collection) of quantum  changes.  If these component  quanta  occur
       totally randomly, then  no  integration  of  them  would  yield  the
       ordered, macroscopic world  we  all   live  in,  because  integrated
       randomness is still random.  Therefore, since the ordered macroworld
       exists, the present QM strong interpretation of its  own statistical
       quantum change postulate is invalid.

       In addition, if quantum change were totally random, then there would
       never be any    possibility,    a    priori,   of   engineering   it
       deterministically.  Presently, almost all quantum physicists believe
       that quantum change cannot be engineered, on first principles.

       On the other hand, if hidden order  is  admitted,  there is at least
       the possibility of  directly  engineering  physical  quantum  change
       itself.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Hidden Variables

       Interestingly, the renowned  physicist  David  Bohm has shown that a
       hidden variable theory  of  quantum   mechanics   can   actually  be
       constructed, whereby one could potentially engineer physical change.
       [ref. 33]

       It is well-known that experimental physics does not  in  any  manner
       refute hidden variable   theories.    Because   of   the  historical
       attachment of physics to the theory  of  the  random  variable, such
       contrary notions as chaos (hidden order) and hidden  variables  have
       simply been greeted  with  suspicion  and shuffled aside.  The usual
       objection is Occam's  razor;  a   theory   must   predict  something
       different, or it is said to be unwarranted. [ref. 34]

       But based on  this  same  form  of  Occam's  overworked  razor,  the
       Whittaker hidden variable    approach    certainly   predicts   many
       profoundly different engineerable   effects  and  capabilities  that
       mandate its full examination.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Correction of the Statistical Postulate

       A much better, valid interpretation of the quantum  change postulate
       is as follows:   "Quantum  change  is  statistical,  and may contain
       hidden order."

       The two interpretations  differ   sharply.   In  the  new  and  less
       restrictive reinterpretation, one has three cases or  subsets  of QM
       as follows:

            (1) the  subset  where  quantum  change contains partial order,
                hence is already chaotic,
            (2) the subset where the internal  order  has vanished, leaving
                the statistics  as Gibbs' random variable  statistics,  and
                exhibiting the present quantum mechanics without chaos, and
            (3) the  subset  where the statistics is totally deterministic,
                but information on the variables is lost.



                                      Page 12





       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Remarks On the New Interpretation

       The new interpretation  is  consistent  with  Bohm's hidden variable
       theory, and it is also consistent  with  the  Schroedinger equation,
       which in the  QM model already propagates the QM states  forward  in
       time with absolute determinism.

       It is even  possible,  for  example,  to deterministically produce a
       Bohm/de Broglie quantum potential,  according  to  a  self-targeting
       repetitive phase conjugation  mechanism  advanced  by  this  author.
       [ref. 35]

       The new interpretation   is   not  consistent  with  the  Copenhagen
       interpretation, which only applies  to  the present QM subset.  This
       can be seen  as  follows:  If  quantum  change  is  engineerable  by
       Whittaker hidden variables,   then   the   inner   contents  of  the
       engineered quantum change are known.

       This knowledge applies to the subset  where  QM change is engineered
       (the new subset),  but  not  to the subset where all  variables  are
       random variables and  hence  not  subject to engineering.  Therefore
       the Copenhagen interpretation applies  to  the random quantum change
       subset, but not to chaotic (partially ordered) quantum change
       subset.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       The New Interpretation Is Testable

       Happily, the reinterpretation  of  the  postulate   now   allows   a
       sufficient collection of  already-chaotic quantum changes to produce
       the well-ordered, macroscopic universe  we  all  live in.  Also, the
       new interpretation is testable, and it can be falsified  or verified
       in the laboratory.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       THE END RESULT OF ABBREVIATING MAXWELL'S THEORY

       Effect On EM

       In discarding the  scalar component of the quaternion, Heaviside and
       Gibbs unwittingly discarded the unified  EM/G  portion  of Maxwell's
       theory that arises when the translational/directional  components of
       two interacting quaternions reduce to zero, but the scalar resultant
       remains and infolds  a  deterministic,  dynamic  structure that is a
       function of oppositive directional/translational components.

       In the infolding  of  EM  energy   inside   a  scalar  potential,  a
       structured scalar potential results, almost precisely as later shown
       by Whittaker but unnoticed by the scientific community.   The simple
       vector equations produced by Heaviside and Gibbs captured only that
       subset of Maxwell's  theory  where  EM  and gravitation are mutually
       exclusive.

       In that subset, electromagnetic  circuits  and  equipment  will  not
       ever, and cannot ever, produce gravitational or inertial  effects in
       materials and equipments.  Not a single one of those Heaviside/Gibbs
       equations ever appeared  in  a paper or book by James Clerk Maxwell,
       even though the severely restricted  Heaviside/Gibbs  interpretation
       is universally and erroneously taught in all Western universities as
       Maxwell's theory.

       Effect On GR

       As a result  of  this  artificial  restriction  of Maxwell's theory,
       Einstein also inadvertently  restricted   his   theory   of  general
       relativity, forever  preventing  the unification of electromagnetics
       and relativity.  He   also   essentially   prevented   the   present
       restricted general relativity from  ever  becoming  an experimental,
       engineerable science on  the  laboratory  bench,   since   a  hidden
       internalized electromagnetics causing a deterministically structured
       local space-time curvature was excluded.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Effect On QM

       Quantum mechanics used   only   the   Heaviside/Gibbs   externalized
       electromagnetics and completely missed  Maxwell's  internalized  and
       ordered electromagnetics enfolded   inside   a   structured   scalar
       potential.  Accordingly, QM   maintained  its  Gibbs  statistics  of
       quantum change, which is non-chaotic a priori.

       Quantum physicists by and largely  excluded  Bohm's  hidden variable
       theory, which conceivably  could  have  offered  the   potential  of
       engineering quantum change, engineering physical reality itself.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       In Summary

       Each of the three major scientific disciplines missed and excluded a
       subset of its  disciplinary area, because it did not have the scalar
       component of the quaternion to incorporate.   Further,  all  of them
       completely missed the significance of the Whittaker  approach, which
       already shows how  to  apply  and engineer the very subsets they had
       excluded.

       What now exist in these areas are  three  inconsistent  disciplines.
       Each of them  unwittingly excluded a vital part of  its  discipline,
       which was the   unified   field  part.   Ironically,  then,  present
       physicists continue to exert great effort to find the missing key to
       unification of the three disciplines,  but find it hopeless, because
       these special subsets are already contradictory to  one  another, as
       is quite well-known to foundations physicists.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       CONCLUSIONS

       Obviously, if one  wishes  to  unify  physics, one must add back the
       unintentionally excluded, unifying subsets to each discipline.

       Interestingly, all three needed subsets  turn  out to be one and the
       same, as shown in Figure 3.  So application of Whittaker's  work  to
       each one of the three disciplines produces the necessary superset of
       each, and these  three  supersets  are  unified in and on the common
       added Whittaker subset.

       Also, as shown in the figure, one gets an added and unexpected bonus
       of great value:  Mind, thought, and life occupy time, and if time is
       treated as a  real  dimension, then  these  are  real  also.   Since
       fundamental units in which physics is modeled are arbitrary, one can
       even model physics in terms of one unit, time.

       In that case, everything is a time structure.  Since  even  physical
       reality can be  viewed  in  this  fashion, it is not unreasonable to
       view mind, thought, and life as real; they do after all occupy time.

       However, since they   do  not  emerge   in   the   normal   external
       electromagnetics, they must   lie   within   the  hidden,   internal
       electromagnetics (since the  photon  carries  both  time and energy,
       being a piece of action).

       Without further development, we  state  that  the  Whittaker  hidden
       variable EM approach,  in allowing the complete engineering  of  the
       internal electromagnetics, allows  the complete engineering of mind,
       thought, and life.  Living systems  have  utilized  the  internal EM
       Whittaker channel (in and through atomic nuclear potentials and area
       quantum potentials) since the beginning. [ref.  36]

       Finally, the Whittaker unification linkage of the three  disciplines
       is testable.  It is engineerable.  It works.

          [5]   Maxwell's true theory of electromagnetics  is  contained in
                some 200-odd  quaternion equations, and is far more complex
                than the gross vector simplification developed by Heaviside
                and Gibbs after Maxwell's  death.   For  a  cogent argument
                about what  might  have  been  discovered much  earlier  in
                physics if  quaternions  had not been cast aside, see James
                D. Edmonds, Jr., "Quaternion Quantum Theory: New Physics or
                Number Mysticism?", Am. J. Phys., 42(3), Mar. 1974, p. 220-
                223.  Just   how   much   more   powerful   was   Maxwell's
                quaternionic expression of EM theory than  was  Heaviside's
                (i.e., the  modern)  vector  interpretation, was succinctly
                expressed by Josephs as  follows:  "Hamilton's  algebra  of
                quaternions, unlike Heaviside's algebra of  vectors, is not
                a mere  abbreviated  mode of expressing Cartesian analysis,
                but is an independent branch  of  mathematics  with its own
                rules of  operation  and  its  own  special   theorems.   A
                quaternion is,  in  fact,  a  generalized  or  hypercomplex
                number..." (H.J. Josephs,  "The  Heaviside  Papers Found at

          [7]   In   the   modern  view,  it  is  trapped  energy  that  is
                gravitational, mass being  viewed  as  simply  such trapped
                energy.  We  point  out that Einstein's formula  E  =  mc^2
                actually is  an expression for mass in terms of its trapped
                EM energy.  Thus we extend the modern view by stating that,
                to first order, Newtonian  gravitational  attraction is due
                to the  attraction  of spatially entrapped  electromagnetic
                energy.  Since   the   electromagnetic   scalar  potentials
                represent just such spatially  entrapped  EM  energy,  then
                they hold a special significance gravitationally.

           [8]  This assertion can be tested.  At the nodal  points  of the
                standing potential  wave,  the  rate  of  flow  of  time is
                normal.  At nonzero points  along  the  wave,  however, the
                local rate of flow of local time varies from normal.  After
                a proper-time interval for the observer at the nodal point,

                normal clocks  and  watches  at  different non-nodal points
                along the wave will appreciably vary in their time reading.
                Initially synchronized   clocks   will  thus  be  found  to
                disagree, if placed in different positions in the Whittaker
                wave and allowed to remain for a test period.  In the past,
                various inventors   have   anecdotally  demonstrated   this

         [26]  Toward the end of his life Heaviside lived as a recluse in a
               small garret apartment, and may have returned  again  to his
               struggle with  quaternions.  In the 1950's handwritten notes
               of a   theory   of  gravitation,   written   in   quaternion
               mathematics, were found beneath the floor boards of his tiny
               study.

               desperately trying to unify electromagnetics and gravitation
               in his theory of general  relativity,  never  realizing that
               his own   overstatement  of  his  "flat  local   space-time"

         [34]  However, even if it predicts something new and is warranted,
               it still may not be adopted.   An  example is the continuing
               reluctance of physicists to reformulate EM theory, stressing
               the primacy of the potential and the fact that not the force
               field but only the potential for the force  field  exists in
               the vacuum.   Even  more so, it is well-known that detection
               is actually binary, and  we  throw  away  precisely  half of
               almost every detection our instruments make.  C.f.  Richard
               Kidd et al, "Evolution of the Modern Photon,"  Am. J. Phys.,
               57(1), Jan.    1989,   p.   27-35.    Generally   in   every
               electromagnetic interaction  of our instruments, two photons
               are produced: one a time-forward photon,  and  the  other  a
               time-reversed photon.  Our detectors essentially measure the
               time-forward photon   half,  not  the  time-reversed  photon
               (antiphoton) half.  The antiphoton  half  produces  a slight
               recoil force (Newton's third law reaction force) in the mass
               (nuclei) of  the  instrument,  which  we ignore.   Also,  we
               continue to   ignore   the  evidence  that  the  photon  and
               antiphoton are not identical.   In  a pumped phase conjugate
               mirror, for  example, the emission of a normal  photon  from
               the mirror  material  results in a recoil of the mirror; the
               emission of an antiphoton  by  the mirror material, however,
               does not result in recoil of the mirror.  Physics  is  still
               not consistent, as is well-known to foundations researchers,
               but this  fact  is  generally  not  accented  to  university
               students.
