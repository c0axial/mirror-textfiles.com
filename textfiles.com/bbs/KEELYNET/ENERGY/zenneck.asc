                    Rediscovering the ZENNECK Surface Wave

In 1916 while speaking of his system for global transmission, Nikola Tesla
cited the analysis of mathematician Arnold N. Sommerfeld as verification of
his explanations of observed radio phenomena.  Tesla was referring to his
system in which 90% to 95% of the electrical energy was manifested at the
transmitters output as "current waves" with the remainder directed to the
antenna structure, resulting in dissipating EM radiation.

In 1909 another investigator by the name of Johann Zenneck, while working to
explain Marconi's trans-oceanic results, showed that a unique type of surface
wave could travel along the interface between the ground and the air.  In the
words of Dr. James Corum,

  "The distinguishing feature of the Zenneck wave was that the propagating
   energy didn't spread like radiation, but was concentrated near the guiding
   surface.  Sommerfeld had shown that an electromagnetic wave could be guided
   along a wire of finite conductivity, and Zenneck conceived that the earth's
   SURFACE would perform in a manner similar to a SINGLE CONDUCTING WIRE."

In commenting on Sommerfeld's analysis of the surface wave, Dr. James R. Wait
states that "The field amplitude varies inversely AS THE SQUARE ROOT of the
horizontal distance from the source..."  It is interesting to note that
Sommerfeld made a point of distinguishing between the "electrodynamic" SURFACE
WAVE and its Hertzian counterpart the SPACE WAVE, believing that both
components could be present in VARYING PROPORTION in the WAVE COMPLEX.  It was
Tesla's assertion that the exact composition of the emissions was dependant
upon the design of the transmitter.

As the study of radio propagation progressed and certain mathematical analyses
EXCLUDED IT, some question as to the existence of the Zenneck surface waves
began to develop.  In 1937 limited support was given to these doubts after
tests showed SIMPLE ANTENNAS driven at 150mHZ produced 100 times LOWER field
strength than predicted.

More recent investigations show evidence that Zenneck waves can, indeed, be
generated.  The LOWER the frequency, the lower the PROPAGATION LOSSES.

It is also apparent that they are NOT a major contributor to the field
produced by an electric dipole or quarter wave RADIATOR, however they can be
strongly excited by a quarter wave RESONATOR!  Once again to quote Dr. Corum,

  "the resulting wave is a SURFACE GUIDED (single conductor) TRANSMISSION LINE
   mode which attenuates EXPONENTIALLY ALONG THE GUIDE...  There is NO INVERSE
   SQUARE spreading or DIFFRACTION, as with Hertzian waves...  With
   appropriate constitutive parameters, a pure Zenneck wave would seem to hold
   out the promise of GUIDED PROPAGATION with NO radiation field to WASTE
   ENERGY."

Plots of field strength vs. frequency indicate that a Zenneck wave propagates
best at ELF and VLF frequencies and would lose much of its advantage as
frequency rose ABOVE 1mHZ.

Vanguard Note

  A sample of a new Russian magazine AURA-Z was sent to KeelyNet almost one
  year ago.  On the back cover was an advertisement for papers describing a
  'new' effect that had been discovered for the transmission of power over a
  single very fine wire.

  The wire could be cut and tied in a bow, yet the power still flowed over the
  wire.  It used something called a 'monovibrator' to produce the peculiar
  wave necessary to achieve this effect.  There was no technical data except
  for that offered in the papers for $100.

  Power transmitted over a wire (note over, not through) is subject to
  dissipation through impedance, capacitance, inductance and resistance.

  Hooper showed that a moebius coil could produce what he called a 'motional
  wave' or a wave of PURE ELECTRIC CHARGE.  When energy moves through matter,
  it is sapped capacitively (electrostatic) and inductively (magnetically).
  The pure electric wave was not sapped in any way and so could be transmitted
  over enormous distances with no signal loss.

  Propagation of such a signal through a transmission line or conductive path
  apparently takes the form of successive solitons that regenerate their
  spherical pattern much like a smoke ring vortex.  It is an enfolded
  structure consisting of high rotation energy in the doughnut shape.

  This ties in with Walter Russell's claims that energy rings form, transmute
  and destory matter, as well as with Larry Spring's claim that energy
  propagates through space in the form of successive spheres as he had
  measured by field strength mapping of fixed frequency transmitters.

  The point here is that everyone is using similar terms and concepts to
  describe the same thing.  The bottomline will be a circuit which we can all
  use to verify the truth of it and then put it TO PRACTICAL USE in doing real
  work.

New Electric Transmission

Y. Egorov (Russia) "Can't it exist?" Izobretatel i Ratsionalizator, 1992, no
5-6, p. 1. Translated and summarized by Igor Goryachev.

According to the information published in the Russian magazine INVENTOR AND
DEVELOPER, a new opportunity to transmit electric energy has been discovered.

As it was demonstrated by scientist Vladislav Avramenko at the Russian (former
All-Union) Electro-Technical Institute in Moscow, it is now possible to
transmit electric energy through just a SINGLE WIRE (similar to
superconductivity at room temperature).  The article does not disclose the
details of the method.  It does say that the primary power source generates
electric energy in OSCILLATING FORM in the RANGE OF SOUND FREQUENCIES.

This energy is then transmitted in a regular way to a small monovibrator
(which is the inventor's secret).  Only one wire goes out of the monovibrator.
The wire extremity is connected by means of this single wire to a small
(match-box size) box.  The box has a regular double contact OUTLET thus
providing a power supply for electric bulbs and other devices.

It is disclosed that the energy transmission through a single wire occurs when
the appropriate frequency (not specified) has been ADJUSTED (tuned) at the
input of the monovibrator.

If the single wire has been cut there is no need to solder the ends of the
wire; it is sufficient to tie the separated ends with a bow knot in order to
restore the line.  They measured the loss of energy in the single wire when
transmitting relavity HIGH POWER over the distance of 100 meters.  It was
reported to be ALMOST ZERO.

The phenomenon disclosed contradicts contemporary accepted science.  But the
article claims it works!  This information, if accurately presented, suggests
that some type of scalar-wave transmission might be involved.  A normal
electric sonic frequency signal would be unlikely to travel (or be guided)
along a conductor of 100 m without significant losses.

Vanguard Note

  As a further comment, John Bedini has been building custom amplifiers for
  several years now using scalar transmission principles.  These amplifiers
  are used in Peter Kelly's BETAR stress cancelling device (see CONTACT1 for
  the address of Interdimensional Sciences).  Peter says they can generate
  100's of watts of acoustic energy over a single strand of wire using a
  scalar signal.  The energy is normally generated, converted at the amplifier
  into scalar form, sent over the wire, then re-constituted at the receiving
  speaker.

  As I understand it, a scalar field can be generated from just about any type
  of energy, sound, electricity, magnetism, light, etc..  That energy simply
  has to be IN VIBRATION so that it can be 180 degree phase reversed to create
  the hyperspace bubble or the soliton bubble called a scalar potential or a
  scalar field, or even a 'quantum potential'.

  These bubbles can be sent down a guided conductor as successively driven
  bubbles for information or energy transmission.  When I explained this idea
  to Bob Beck at a workshop with he and Ed Skilling, Bob said that was the
  best explanation he'd ever heard for scalars.

  So, the energy is vibrating at a frequency determined by the vibration
  across the diameter of the mass structure.  When this frequency (ies in some
  cases) is phase reversed, it creates the scalar potential bubble.  The
  energy disappears from our detection threshold and creates a stress wave in
  hyperspace.  From that point, it can be sent to a target where it is
  received, the phase restored to 3 space coordinates and the energy is again
  available for use, all with the minimum diminution of energy.

  The one major problem is our understanding of how to receive these scalar
  bubbles.  Transmission appears to be simply a 180 degree phase shift, done
  with a bifilar wire to cancel the magnetic component, a moebius to create
  the one dimensional surface (pure electric wave of Hooper) or a caduceus.

  For reception of a scalar potential, the bubble still has a vibrational
  component that can be accessed via resonance.  Using a caduceus or moebius
  antenna tuned to the frequency of the transmitted scalar bubble, it would be
  received but not detectable with normal instrumentation UNTIL the phase had
  been restored.  It is best understood as an enfolding process where the wave
  is folded onto itself (like a doughnut vortex), moved to the target, then
  opened back up.

  I have also been told that the scalar is a kind of building block for all
  energy.  Once the energy has been converted to the base form of scalar, it
  can be 're-converted' to any type of energy in our 3 space.  Thus, using
  scalars, you could convert sound to scalar, then scalar back into
  electricity or light to scalar, then back to magnetism.

  At this time, I think the form of the re-conversion back to 3 space is
  dependent on the medium used for its reception.  That is a coil would
  produce magnetic energy, a capacitor would produce electrostatic energy and
  I have no idea how sound would be produced direct from scalar energy.  There
  are indications it is a matter of frequency based on the 'aether spectrum'
  as shown in the file NEUTRAL1 on KeelyNet.

  At this point, perhaps these correlations will lead to something practical.
  It is not overunity because we are dealing with power transmission, not
  generation.  Where this information is useful, is in providing very high
  transmission efficiencies approaching unity, but that is a start...>>> Jerry
