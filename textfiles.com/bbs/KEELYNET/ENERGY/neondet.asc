              Also take the diagram NEONDET.GIF, see also MAGALT.ZIP.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       The schematic, NEONDET.GIF,  is a derivative of a microwave detector
       described in the  February,  1980,   "Ham   Radio"   magazine.    As
       originally created, the circuit's purpose is to detect  microwave RF
       standing waves, but  with minor modification, it can also be used as
       an effective scalar wave detector.

       The schematic shows a round magnet epoxied to the NE-2 lamp, to help
       isolate it from EM signals.  Additionally,  the  circuit  should  be
       enclosed in a  metal  box,  or  "Faraday  Cage", with  shielded  I/O
       connectors.

       The power source  consists  of  eight 9V batteries.  Battery life is
       very nearly the same as shelf life,  because the lamp is operated in
       "starvation" mode, drawing approximately 0.1ma.

       The 25K and 250K potentiometers are adjusted first to fire the NE-2,
       at approximately 60-70 volts, then adjusted until  only  the  tip of
       the cathode electrode  glows.   The 100K pot is adjusted for optimum
       output gain.

       Notes:

           1.  The 741 can be replaced with  a  1458  cascade amplifier for
               better results.
           2.  The  RF  loops  in  the NE-2 leads are mandatory  to  reduce
               interference as well as lamp current noise.
           3.  Component  values  are  not  critical, and can be changed as
               required for the type of output device.
           4.  Removing  the  magnet  and   Faraday   Cage,  and  adding  a
               capacitively coupled  loop  antenna  will permit  use  as  a
               microwave EM detector.
