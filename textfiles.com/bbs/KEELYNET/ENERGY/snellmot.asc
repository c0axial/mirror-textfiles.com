Jerry, please examine MYMOT1.gif. (renamed SNELLMOT.GIF)

It starts with approximately 3kv charge on C1. When C1 is fully charged and
switch contacts are aligned, it fires through T1 and places a charge on C3.

T1's CEMF (counter or back electromotive force) is sent to C2, recovering a
great portion of the charge.  C3 is then fired through T3 for additional
torque.

C2, at full charge, fires T2 and partially charges C4. T2's CEMF is sent to
C1. C4 is then fired through T4 for additional torque.

This differs from Gray's system. He sends CEMF pulses directly to the
batteries. That's not really healthy for the plates. This circuit only accepts
a small trickle of power from the outside to top off C1 and C2.  It can then
run a small generator or alternator circuit to provide current to charge the
batteries.

Whatever power passes from C1 to C3 creates a magnetic field in T1, but NO
CHARGE IS LOST while creating the field! Magnets DO NOT "consume" the
electricity.

Make yourself a test setup. Use Two large low voltage Capacitors. Make sure
one is about 1/2 the capacity of the other. Charge the smaller one fully and
discharge it into the larger one. Take measurements ON BOTH before and after
discharging them together to see how much power is transferred.

Now do the same with a small bulb in series as you discharge the small cap
into the larger one. Measure the power levels in both caps. You will have had
some light produced and some heat, but the WHOLE charge is transferred to the
other capacitor!!!!!!

Reciprocating charges are most likely what the Statica machine is based on.

If you place a highly inductive electromagnet in place of the bulb in the
example above, you'll have a magnetic field produced that doesn't "consume"
any power. Heater elements can be used the same way!

This proves that all electromagnetism, heat and light are produced in
electrical circuits by the "zero point" energy and the electricity is just a
catalyst!!!

WE'VE BEEN USING F/E IN ALL OUR ELECTRICAL DEVICES RIGHT FROM THE START
WITHOUT EVEN REALIZING IT!!

This is not my discovery. I just gleaned it from a book from H.A. Industries.
I tested the theory using the experiment above. It WORKS!!!

I think that F/E and overunity results are in the VERY near future.  Please
feel free to put the motor circuit in the public domain.  Have fun!
                   ----------------------------------------
Anybody want to volunteer to do a short animation of this sequence that we
could list on KeelyNet?  It would help to visualize what is going on a bit
more clearly.  Perhaps with the capacitors partially draining when the coils
discharge, then refilling as well as the rotor spinning when the magnets
propel it?
