       Vangard Note

          I had  a  recent phone conversation with an interesting fellow in
          which he spoke of a "free energy" device that he had heard of.

          He heard it from a friend who had seen it while on a tour of duty
          during the Viet Nam War.  This  file  is presented on KeelyNet in
          two forms : MAGALT.ASC  - this ASCII text ONLY
                      MAGALT1.ZIP -  the  ASCII  text and  the  MAGALT1.GIF
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       In Lee's own words

          Here's the  best  I  can  remember  of  what  I heard from a good
          friend.  He was in Viet Nam during the time when "tourism" was at
          it's worst.  <joke>  There was  a  need  for  a quiet way to make
          electricity (in a jungle environment where noise  would  show the
          presence of enemies to the Viet Cong)

          Someone on  a  NAVY  ship  figured  this design out during a long
          boring trip at sea.  The discs  (see  MAGALT1.GIF) were from some
          kind of ship's motor or generator and when spun they continued to
          do so, causing the alternators attached to them  to turn and make
          lots of AC current.

          His description as far as I can remember is presented in the .GIF
          file.  Now,  you  must  understand  he is NOT an engineer and his
          description of what he saw may  not be corect.   For example..the
          "alternators" attached to the magnetic discs might  not have been
          alternators but  some kind of device that changed the energy that
          traveled down the shafts connecting them to the magnets.

          What I'm saying is that this is  a  VERY  limited  starting point
          from which to attempt to reverse engineer this device.  I'm sorry
          but this is the best I can do.

          He said  the  Alternators  were  wired together and that the only
          time the machine stopped working  was  when  the discs got out of
          sync and had to be restarted by aligning a mark  on each disc and
          giving them both a spin toward each other from the top.

          I assume  the  discs  were  eccentrically mounted but this is not
          absolute nor is anything else...beg apology...  I tried my best

                                      Page 1





          to obtain more info about this design but was unsuccessful.  As I
          said he  wasn't  an  engineer  and  didn't understand what he was
          looking at, other than the obvious;  that  it was producing power
          without fuel!!   He  said  that  there  was  a fellow  in  Oregon
          someplace that had built one of these but didn't want anything to
          do with anyone about it.

       Vangard note

          I might  add  some  of  what  Lee told me on the phone that would
          further clarify  the  machine   and  its  operation.   The  basic
          description of the machine was that it consisted of two identical
          units that were placed next to each other.  Each  had  a magnetic
          disk that  was  about  3  feet in diameter and from 2 to 3 inches
          thick.

          Each magnetic disk was mounted  on  the  shaft  of  the generator
          which when spun caused the generation of current.   It would seem
          the weight of the disks caused them to function as flywheels
          with the  magnetic field giving a push or pull at the right time.
          (I thought he said on the phone that the disks spun on a vertical
          axis but the drawing (MAGALT1.GIF) refutes that.)

          He said each of the generators  provided  EQUAL amounts of energy
          and that  the  energy  that  was  drawn from each  unit  must  be
          MIRRORED by  the other.  That is, when one generator was drawn on
          for more power than the other,  the  unequal  loading would cause
          the spinning flywheel magnets to lose their sync  and rotate to a
          halt.

          Each disk  had a reference mark that would remain in sync as long
          as the disks spun.  The means of  starting the wheels to spinning
          was to  grab  both disks and pull at the same time.   They  would
          then begin  to  spin  and  eventually  achieve a stable rotation.
          (Much like how the Testatika machine  is started and achieves ITS
          OWN RESONANT velocity!)

          Lee also  said  that  his source mentioned that  the  disks  were
          slightly off-balance  due to being mounted on an eccentric.  As I
          understood it during the phone  conversation  (and now looking at
          the .GIF image) he indicated the disks got closest  to each other
          WHEN THE SYNC MARK came around.

       If the polarization was on the north half of the disk (imagine a bar
       magnet in the  center of the disk, and there could be more than one)
       with the south being on the opposite half, it would then provide the
       maximum polar repulsion  as the  disks  came  into  contact  at  the
       closest eccentric proximity point.

       Since like poles REPEL, then one can see how the axis  of  the north
       OR south pole  would have the greatest force while the equator would
       provide the least due to field cancellation.

       As it rotated around, the repulsion  would  gradually DECREASE as it
       approached the equator (90 degrees from the pole).   On  passing the
       equator, the velocity  from  the  repulsion  of the last orbit would
       continue to drive the disk through  the  INCREASING repulsion of the
       opposite south pole,  though at a much LESSER INTENSITY  because  of
       the greater distance between the poles.  (this is the trick, how to

                                      Page 2





       overcome that increasing  replusion to cause the disk to go over the
       "hump")

       This means that when the sync lines  that  were  drawn  on each disk
       were lined up,  the  disks  would  be CLOSEST to one  another.   180
       degrees from that  point,  the  opposite  sync  lines would mean the
       disks would be at the GREATEST distance due to the eccentric.

       So, with the addition of the eccentric  rotation (which Lee said was
       about 1/4" distance  at the closest point of the disks,  the  closer
       the better) then  the  REPULSION  WOULD BE GREATEST when the axis of
       each pole lined up. For those without  graphics capabilities, I have
       included an ASCII equivalent drawing so you can get  an  idea of the
       machine.

       One more point  that  Lee  said  on  the  phone,  though  I might be
       mistaken.  As I remember the conversation,  he  said  he thought the
       disks might have been slightly tilted (on the horizontal axis).

       If there was a weight added to one side of the disk, probably at the
       sync mark, then that might give an additional impetus  to accelerate
       the rotation to overcome the increasing repulsion on the "uptake".

       The machine would  appear  to  operate  on  a  very common principle
       associated with most perpetual motion  devices.   Most  machines are
       lucky to achieve 60% efficiency.  100% would be unity  and  anything
       over that would  be  overunity.   The idea with overunity is for the
       machine to be able to provide enough energy to sustain its operation
       in a closed system.  Anything beyond  what  that takes would thus be
       "free energy."  We would appreciate your comments on this matter.
