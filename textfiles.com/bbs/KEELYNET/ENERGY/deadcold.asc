       VANGARD NOTE...

            This is  an article that was in The Dallas Times Herald Sunday,
            June 23, 1991.  This article speaks for itself, by showing that
            some of  our  scientists, who  don't  care  to  understand  new
            technology or research it, would rather just  call  it  foo foo
            and pack their bags and run.

            It is  a shame, that we of the U. S. can start new projects and
            then give  them up to other  countries  to  continue  with  the
            development. SOME DAY WE WILL LEARN!

                          COLD FUSION NO LONGER HOT TOPIC

                       UTAH SHUTTING DOWN RESEARCH FACILITY
                                 By Steve Wiegand
                            from McClatahy News Service


       SALT LAKE CITY  - Some day this month, workers will  take  down  the
       impressive lettering on the signs outside the building.

       The last microscope  will  be  packed  and the last guy out the door
       will turn off the lights.

       America will no longer have a National  Cold  Fusion Institute.  And
       Utah will have  erased  the  last visible reminder  of  a  27  month
       roller-coaster ride that   took  the  state  from  the  top  of  the
       scientific world to the bottom and  stunted  the growth of an entire
       area of research.

       "It was more than a little embarrassing for all of  us,"  said Allan
       Witt, executive director  of the Utah Foundation, a privately funded
       think tank that studies social and  economic  issues.  "It's  one of
       those things we'd like to put behind us."

       They were singing a different tune in these parts on March 23, 1989,
       when two scientists  at  the University of Utah announced  they  had
       achieved nuclear fusion in the scientific equivalent of a teacup.

       The researchers, chemistry department chairman Stanley Pons and

                                      Page 1





       chemistry professor Martin Fleischmann, claimed they filled a beaker
       with hydrogen-rich "heavy"  water, stuck in an electrode made of the
       metal palladium and wrapped in platinum  wire,  shot  some  electric
       current through it and produced nuclear fusion - the  energy process
       the sun uses - at room temperatures.

       It was tantamount  to  finding  a  virtually inexhaustible and clean
       energy source, and it set off a paroxysm  of pie-in-the-sky rhetoric
       and test-tube rattling from Tokyo to Texas.

       Scientists in Japan, Switzerland, Texas, Brazil and the Soviet Union
       rushed to replicate  the  research.  Pons  and Fleischmann  appeared
       before Congress to   seek  funding  for  further  research.    World
       palladium prices soared.

       The Utah Legislature agreed to spend  $4.5 million to finance a cold
       fusion institute in a sleek new research park near  the  university.
       State attorneys spent  another $500,000 scrambling to protect patent
       rights.

       "Fusion Buster" sweat shirts, coffee mugs and key rings went on sale
       at the university book store.   A  Mexican restaurant put together a
       rum-and-tequila drink, called it the Cold Fusion and  despite Utah's
       arcane liquor laws sold five dozen of them in two hours.

       "If this thing is what they think it is," Gov. Norman Bangerter said
       at the time, "It's better than the gold rush."

                                JOKES AND RIDICULE

       Only it wasn't. Almost simultaneous with the rush of enthusiasm came
       a wave of doubt from much of the world's scientific community, which
       tried in vain to validate the experiment.

       "It was never  a  science  story," said Robert Park, director of the
       American Physical Society. "It was voodoo."

       As evidence mounted  that  there   were   problems   with   the  two
       scientists' research, the  pair became more reclusive,  refusing  to
       discuss their work  or share specifics with other scientists.   Pons
       eventually declined to  speak publicly,  communicating  through  his
       lawyer or via a fax machine.

       And as the  "gee-whiz"  aspects  of the issue wore  off,  they  were
       replaced by jokes and ridicule.

       "Cold fusion in  Utah?"  observed comedian Mark Russell.  "You can't
       even get cold beer in Utah."

       Utahans, stung by the criticisms,  said the sniping was just so much
       scientific sour grapes from "the Eastern establishment."

       Within a few months, however, the bloom was off the cold fusion rose
       nearly everywhere.  Anticipated  financial  help  from  the  federal
       government and from   private   companies   that   expressed   early
       enthusiasm never materialized, and  a  spokesman  for  the institute
       said there are  no prospects of a last-minute bailout  to  keep  the
       place going when state funds run out June 30.

       "I don't think  there would be any more grants from anywhere even if
       they came up with a way to turn  tap  water  into  gold  dust." said
       university news director Larry Weist.  "It's over."

       Which explains why  there  were  plenty  of parking  places  at  the
       institute last week,  and  why the last entry in the visitor log was
       dated March 23.

       "No one comes up here unless they're from the university and looking
       to get some equipment," said a staff member who declined to give his
       name.

       A review released last month of the  institute's  work by a panel of
       independent scientists praised  the  institute's   work   ethic  but
       concluded it had  failed  to  prove  the  existence of a cold fusion
       process.

       "We could have accomplished something  with  more  support  and more
       time and less controversy," the staff member said,  walking past the
       lobby's pictorial display  of a then-triumphant Pons and Fleischmann
       and an announcement of the staff's  farewell  banquet featuring crab
       legs and prime rib.

       "It's a damned shame," he said as he loaded boxes into  a car truck.
       "Sometimes I think  the  whole  thing  may  have done more harm then
       good."

                                A CRIMP IN RESEARCH

       He's not alone in that assessment.  Scientists  and  energy industry
       officials say that in the wake of the controversy,  funding  sources
       for cold fusion  research have dried up in this country, even though
       work is continuing on a relatively  large  scale  in  Japan  and the
       Soviet Union.

       "I think it's fair to say that the Utah experience  has really put a
       crimp in the  image of cold fusion research." said David Worledge of
       the Palo Alto, Calif. based Electric  Power  Research  Institute,  a
       group financed by  the  nation's  electric  power  industry.   "Utah
       generated a lot  of  skepticism,  and  that's difficult to overcome,
       especially in tough economic times."

       Worledge said EPRI  will spend about  $3  million  to  finance  cold
       fusion research this  year. But the Department of Energy,  according
       to a spokesman, has no plans to spend anything in the area.

       "Until there is  a  convincing  argument  made  by someone that such
       research is a  valid  endeavor,"   said  department  spokesman  Jeff
       Sherwood, "it's doubtful there will be much [financial] support from
       here."

       But researchers aren't alone in bearing scars from  the  cold fusion
       fallout.

       Dominated by the Mormon church's theology and saddled with a sagging
       economy, cold fusion  was  viewed  as a means of serving both church
       and state.

       "The church believes that it has a mission to save the world in

                                      Page 3





       practical as well   as  religious  terms,"  said  Thane  Robson,  an
       economics professor at the University  of Utah.  "This [cold fusion]
       held out the hope of an energy supply that would benefit  the entire
       world."

       Robson and others  said  there  was  also  the  hope that out of the
       research would come  a "Fusion Valley"  that  would  invigorate  the
       economy and put Utah on the map as something other  than  the West's
       most out-of-step state.

       "Utah for a long time has had an insecurity complex," said political
       scientist J.D. Williams.  "To  be  a  world  leader  in something as
       important as this would have gone  a  long  way  toward dealing with
       that. It's too bad it didn't work out."
