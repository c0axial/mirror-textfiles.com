                         by Rick Andersen,  April 5, 1993

       This file is  an  account  of some of my investigations into what is
       popularly known as   Scalar   Electromagnetics,    specifically   as
       conceptualized by Lt.  Col.  Thomas  E. Bearden (ret.),  Huntsville,
       Alabama.  This file  assumes  that  you  are  already  familiar with
       Bearden's works as published by Tesla  Book Company and as listed on
       many of the BBS's.  But a brief synopsis of his views  are presented
       for the benefit  of  those  who  are  not  familiar  with  Bearden's
       writings.

       Tom Bearden's version of electromagnetics  is  a direct challenge to
       the electromagnetics that physicists and electronics  engineers  are
       taught.

       His understanding of  EM,  if  correct,  would  open  up  a vast new
       physics in which reality itself could be manipulated in ways that we
       in this last  decade  of  the  20th  century  can  still  only  call
       "magical".

       As an electronics tech with a broad interest in "fringe science" in
       general and in  such  things  as  the  Philadelphia   Experiment  in
       particular, I have   had   to   familiarize   myself   with  several
       "unconventional" ideas and hypotheses.

       Tom Bearden's Scalar    Electromagnetics    could    explain    many
       "paranormal" mysteries in terms of a scientific model.   We  need to
       evaluate his work.

                       TOM BEARDEN'S SCALAR ELECTROMAGNETICS

       Very briefly, Bearden's  main  points of disagreement with classical
       EM are these:

         * Quantum physicists consider the  Potentials  in the vacuum to be
           the primary causal agents.  Force fields (E and  B  fields)  are
           EFFECTS of  the interference of potentials.  Classical EM has it
           the other way around:

                                      Page 1





           Force fields  CAUSE  and  potentials are the (abstract) EFFECTS.
           It may seem to be an ivory-tower  semantics game, but if Bearden
           and Quantum Physics are right, the implications are tremendous.

         * Classical  EM  fails to distinguish between CHARGE  and  CHARGED
           MASS.  The  classical EM man says "Show me some 'charge' without
           some mass to contain that charge!"  Bearden replies, "Define for
           me what charge is!

           You can't.  You confuse charged  mass with charge itself.  Ditto
           with most  other  fundamental  definitions in Physics,  such  as
           Vector, Energy,  Mass,  Vacuum,  etc."  Bearden EQUATES Massless
           Charge, Potential, Vacuum, Spacetime,  'Ether',  Virtual  Photon
           Flux.

         * Classical  EM  describes the Electric and Magnetic  "fields"  in
           terms of  Vectors  and Scalars.  On the simplest level, a vector
           is an  abstract way of describing  something  in  terms  of  its
           MAGNITUDE and DIRECTION.  Like "one mile due North".   A  scalar
           is described by MAGNITUDE ONLY.

           Like the  temperature  of  the  air  in your living room, or the
           pressure of a gas inside a flask.  Of course, Bearden expands on
           these definitions considerably.

       Bearden claims that history has pulled a fast one on us:

           What we call 'Maxwell's Equations' are in fact not his equations
           at all!   Maxwell,  says  Bearden,   wrote   his   equations  in
           QUATERNIONS, a   complex   number   system   devised    by   the
           mathematician Hamilton, which involved "multi-dimensional" math.
           On this  basis, Maxwell's ORIGINAL EM theory is said to have had
           implications for more than our three spatial dimensions; TIME as
           the supposed FOURTH dimension would enter the equations, and, as
           Bearden claims, had the original  quaternion  theory  been  left
           intact, Einstein   might   have  found  his  long   sought-after
           Unification of EM with Gravitation.

           Bearden says  of  quaternions  what  Italians  say  about  Prego
           spaghetti sauce: "IT'S IN THERE!!"

           What is "in there" is the mathematical  basis  for  all  of  the
           magic things we fringe science aficcionados have  always  wanted
           proof of:   the   means  to  produce  antigravity,  time-travel,
           teleportation, age and disease regression, etc.

         * All of these possibilities, says  Bearden,  were aborted because
           Oliver Heaviside  (and to some extent, Willard  Gibbs),  a  late
           19th-century physicist,  did not understand Maxwell's quaternion
           theory, and  so  he  'cleaned   up'   the   theory,   condensing
           quaternions into  an abbreviated and emaciated "vector"  theory,
           which still  contains a scalar component, but which component is
           largely de-emphasized.

           And it worked!  EM until now  has  functioned  very well, on the
           technological level, using the deficient Vector  theory.  Toward
           the latter  half  of  this  century,  Quantum physicists such as
           Feynman began to realize that  "Maxwell's"  EM (Heaviside's) was
           flawed in several respects at its foundations.  Among the

                                      Page 2





           phenomena that   Physics   has   discovered  that  Classical  EM
           apparently fails to account for is the Aharonov-Bohm effect,
           which essentially    allows     action     and     instantaneous
           intercommunication between  widely separated particles  in  some
           mysterious way.

         * Bearden  points  to the two seminal papers of mathematician E.T.
           Whittaker, written in 1903 and  '04, just as Albert Einstein was
           about to   publish  his  famous  Relativity  theory   in   1905.
           Whittaker's math  shows how any scalar potential can be analyzed
           and considered to be composed of a harmonic series of
           bi-directional waves, flowing into and out of the potential.

           Something like our concept of  "standing  waves"  but  with some
           important differences.   Conversely,  Whittaker's   other  paper
           shows that  any  EM  wave  can be considered to be the effect of
           interfering two  or more scalar  potentials  in  a  given  area.
           Since these potentials exist in more than our three  dimensional
           world (as  we  perceive it), if we know how to properly engineer
           and combine such potentials artificially,  we  can  perform some
           mighty magical feats, such as to transmit EM energy "around" our
           normal spacetime, to have it appear out of nowhere at a distance
           from our special transmitter.  Much of Bearden's  writings go on
           to describe  (speculate  on,  actually)  ominous  Soviet  scalar
           weaponry based on this technology.   (Since  the collapse of the
           Communist Soviet  Union, Bearden's emphasis has  shifted  toward
           the extraction of "free" energy from the vacuum and how diseases
           such as  cancer  and  AIDS  may  be cured using spinoffs of this
           Scalar EM.)

         * Based on the points mentioned  above,  Bearden sees an EM wave a
           bit differently than did Maxwell.  Although he  faults the world
           for not going back to the REAL Maxwellian quaternion theory, and
           thereby continuing  to miss the boat that would finally unify EM
           with gravitation  (which  Einstein   searched   in   vain   for,
           supposedly), yet Bearden departs from his hero  Maxwell  on  the
           subject of  just  what an Electromagnetic wave is; specifically,
           whether it propagates TRANSVERSELY or LONGITUDINALLY through the
           vacuum.  Maxwell, quaternions  or  not,  assumed a transverse EM
           wave, because, says Bearden, he assumed a MECHANICAL  ETHER,  as
           did most of the 19th century physicists.

           Nikola Tesla,  on the other hand, did not agree.  Tesla believed
           that EM waves propagated longitudinally,  as  do  sound waves in
           air, through a gaseous ether.

           Bearden emphatically states that, despite popular opinion, Tesla
           was right and all of our present physics is wrong on this point.

           There are  many  other  points  made  by  Bearden  about  Scalar
           Electromagnetics that  differ sharply with the present Classical
           EM; I  think  I have brought  out  the  main  ones  here.   (See
           Bearden's works   for  further  detail,  especially   the   file
           THEORYBE.ASC on the KeelyNet and other BBS's.)

                                MY OWN COGITATIONS

       Now that I'd  spent  about  a  year reading and re-reading Bearden's
       papers, and trying to understand just  what  he was talking about, I
       was beginning to ask myself, 'Just how DO we know what  we  think we
       know' in Classical EM?  Are some of our "doctrines" just uncorrected
       mistakes of history  that have achieved sainthood?  Probably.  After
       all, Bearden cites many references  from  Quantum Physics to support
       his views.  Of course, QP is not without problems of  its  own, just
       as is every   other   MODEL   of   reality.   Ah,  how  painful  and
       disappointing it had been for me when  I first realized that WE KNOW
       NOTHING IN THE ABSOLUTE 'TRUTH' SENSE.

       All we do  is spin elaborate yarns that we call "Models",  which  we
       try to disprove when we are being true scientists, but mostly try to
       defend fanatically when  we  revert  back  to  being  regular  human
       beings.

       And yet, these flawed models have  enabled  us  in  one  century  to
       conceive and apply a technology that has literally  transformed  the
       world.  So we  like  to  keep  telling ourselves that we're "getting
       there", little by little.  Our models may be quite erroneous, but if
       they work, we use them until somebody  comes  along  with  something
       better.

       And this is what Tom Bearden is doing, except he  is  claiming  that
       his model is  NOT something new; it has been around for at least 100
       years but we've been too stupid to see it, because we allowed Oliver
       Heaviside and his vector oversimplification to blind us.

       Well, I've bought a lot of snake oil  over  the years, and as we all
       know, the field of speculative science is overflowing with snake oil
       salesmen,' so I  try  to  temper  my  tendency to rejoice  over  the
       promises of magic  with the caution I have had to learn the hard way
       by having one  'scheme'  after another  turn  out  to  be  hot  air.
       Scientific method involves testing any new hypothesis rigorously; if
       the promoter of the idea can't take the heat, he shouldn't jump into
       the frying pan.

       So I found  Bearden's telephone number and decided  to  give  him  a
       call.  (I've found  that  writing is too frustrating: either they're
       too busy to answer or they just  don't.   Either  way,  you  end  up
       waiting for weeks.)

       To my surprise, Tom Bearden seemed more than happy to talk about his
       work over the phone.  I noticed that he tended to talk  so much that
       it was sometimes  hard  to get a word in edgewise, but I appreciated
       his willingness to spend time on the  phone  and figured he might be
       able to clarify  for  me  whatever  I couldn't understand  from  his
       writings.

       We talked of  the  'primacy of the Potential', about phase-conjugate
       waves in non-linear materials, about  his  friend  Frank  Golden who
       appears to be a 'silent source' of a lot of his ideas  and  who  has
       allegedly built several  proprietary  scalar  devices  (no,  Bearden
       wouldn't tell me anything of substance about them).

       My first call to Bearden was sometime in November 1992, if I recall,
       and I waited until March '93 to call again, when I had some (I

                                      Page 4





       thought) real questions about stuff I couldn't figure out on my own.
       I didn't want to abuse his phone hospitality by calling more often.

       So the 2nd call was in late March.  My question was about his latest
       papers on Free  Energy  -  The  Final  Secret  (see  KeelyNet  files
       FREENRG1 & FREENRG2) that had come out around March 16.

       The bottom line on free energy was  that  you  needed  a "Degenerate
       Semi-conductor" between your source of potential (battery, etc.) and
       your switching function;  from there on to the load  you  could  use
       regular conductive copper  wiring.  Bearden was saying here that the
       reason most of  the  earlier  attempts  at  building  "free  energy"
       devices had given inconclusive results was that none of the previous
       inventors were using this "degenerative semiconductor" material that
       Bearden had finally figured out was the missing link, after 30 years
       of intensive research into the subject.

       At this point, of course, I was beginning to wonder  just  what this
       latest revelation meant  as  regards all of Bearden's PREVIOUS books
       announcing free energy inventors and  their WORKING devices, happily
       extracting free energy from the vacuum.

       Hadn't Bearden   endorsed   John  Bedini's  battery-motor-generator-
       flywheel device, claiming  that  when  the  battery  electrolyte was
       pulsed at the resonant frequency of  the ions in it, free energy was
       being 'coupled' into the circuit and that the battery was recharging
       itself?

       There was no  mention  of  any  "degenerate semiconductor"  material
       there.  Bearden's advice  (in  the  Introduction to the Bedini book,
       available through Tesla Book Co.)  was to "have at it" and build the
       thing, all of you eager experimenters out there, in  order  to prove
       once and for  all  to  the  "establishment"  en  masse, which "they"
       couldn't deny, that free energy  extraction  is  both  possible  and
       practical. (Be careful, though: Your battery will explode if you hit
       it too hard  with  a  voltage  spike;  the hydrogen  gas  inside  is
       particular about the  magnitude  of the charge-pulse.  But don't let
       that stop you.  Let's work out the bugs.)

       Then there was Floyd Sweet, Bearden's  subject  of  his 1992 papers.
       (See SWEET1-4D.ASC on KeelyNet for further details on this device.)
       Sweet allegedly built   a  device  exploiting  the   properties   of
       ferromagnetic materials to exhibit non-linear phase-conjugate mirror
       properties.

       This thing was  supposed  to  have  actually levitated off the bench
       during a demonstration, but they  stopped  it  before  it blew apart
       from all that "negative energy" it was producing.  No mention of any
       degenerate semiconductor here,  either.  Just the  magic  of  pumped
       phase-conjugate mirror theory,  integrated  into  Bearden's  earlier
       explanations of Scalar  Electromagnetics   as   the  engineering  of
       spacetime stresses.

       Hell, I'd be happy to have PROOF that one of these earlier devices
       actually levitated or  distorted  time or recharged  itself  forever
       with no drain on the battery.  (How about a demonstration on "20/20"
       or full schematics  for  the  Sweet  device?  Oh, that's right: it's
       proprietary!)


                                      Page 5





       But now Tom  Bearden  has  even  better  info  --  The Final Secret.
       Golly!  When that weird metal called Nitinol first came out, eager
       experimenters could buy it through  mail order.  Surely I can expect
       to see someone  marketing  "Tom  Bearden's Old Fashioned  Degenerate
       Semiconductor Elixir" in sample quantities real soon?

       My point is,  he  encourages inventors and tinkerers accross America
       to stop believing everything they've been taught in Classical EM and
       to go and build "free energy" motors  such  as Bedini's, because, as
       he puts it, he 'cares about that poor little old lady down the block
       who is being ripped-off by the Power Companies that be.'

       Okay, so now he tells me I'll get erratic results unless I use some
       genuine "degenerate semiconductor", such as doped copper wire.

       How does a basement tinkerer like me accomplish this?  I know, I'll
       call and ask.  Thus my March phone call.

       Bearden's immediate reply  was that I needed to "use  that  mass  of
       gray matter between  my  ears" and engage a good materials scientist
       to come up with a degenerate semiconductor for me.  Oh.  I thought I
       could put the power company out of  business  just  using parts from
       Radio Shack.  So no one had ever BUILT a device based  on this doped
       copper or whatever;  it  was  simply  Bearden's latest CONCEPT which
       would tend to validate his view of the Potential.  Hmm.

       A few days later I decided to press  my  luck  and call again.  This
       time I had been thinking hard (I thought) on just  how  and  why  we
       traditionally believe in the transverse EM wave, whereas Bearden and
       Tesla say, no, there is only a longitudinal wave in the vacuum.

       Specifically, I was thinking about POLARIZATION in an EM wave.  How
       does Bearden's Scalar  EM  account for the OBSERVATION that EM waves
       can be polarized, if polarization is DUE to the ORIENTATION of the E
       field which Bearden denies even  exists  outside  your  antenna?   I
       wanted an honest  answer  to this problem; I was not  pursuing  this
       with an ulterior  motive,  such as to disprove Bearden.  Not at all.
       I really wanted   to   understand.    Remember,   our   Model   must
       satisfactorily account for all observed phenomena.  If another model
       can explain it better, then "more power to it!"  But  any  Ham radio
       operator can verify  the  fact  that  something we call polarization
       does indeed affect the transmission and reception of EM waves.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

                   MAXWELL and TRANSVERSE vs. LONGITUDINAL WAVES

       You see, the genius of Maxwell's insight was this:

           Maxwell knew that a changing magnetic field around a wire (which
           we can measure at low frequencies with a compass placed near the
           wire) will induce a changing electric  field  (and an electrical
           current) in  another  wire  nearby.  Faraday had  explored  this
           phenomenon.  It  stood  to reason that a changing electric field
           ought to produce a magnetic effect.

       Unfortunately, Maxwell could not  verify  that  experimentally.   He
       assumed that the   measuring   devices  of  the  time   lacked   the
       sensitivity required to  prove  the  SYMMETRY  of  induction between
       electricity and magnetism.

                                      Page 6





       However, Maxwell was  a  mathematician  with  enough  faith  in such
       symmetry that he  stuck  an  extra  term  into  the  equations  that
       described this complementary electric-to-magnetic effect  which  was
       as yet unproven.   This  led  to  the  extrapolation of a see-sawing
       pattern of electric-magnetic-electric-magnetic...  etc., one type of
       effect generating the other, forming an ELECTROMAGNETIC  WAVE  whose
       fields would "chase"  each  other out into the space surrounding the
       wire in which the AC current flowed back and forth to generate these
       changing fields.

       Evidently it was because a magnetic  field  (as  sensed by a compass
       needle) forms at right angles to a current of electrons  in  a wire,
       that it was  assumed  that this 90 degree relationship continued out
       into the space surrounding the wire.

       So the Transverse EM wave, according to Classical EM, consists of an
       alternating Electric field and Magnetic field at right angles to one
       another, and at  90 degrees to the  direction  that  the  waves  are
       moving out toward (the direction of Propagation).

       Sound waves, by  contrast,  are  Longitudinal;  that   is,  the  air
       molecules through which  sound  travels are, at a given point, first
       COMPRESSED, then DECOMPRESSED or RAREFIED,  such that the density of
       the air at  any  given  point  varies  at the sound frequency.   The
       molecules themselves wiggle  back  and  forth  in  the  direction of
       propagation, first a little bit out  and away from the sound source,
       then a little  bit  back  in  toward the source.  Overall,  the  air
       doesn't FLOW from  the  sound  source  to your ear, but the waves of
       compression and rarefaction are what  propagate  through  the medium
       from source to  ear.  You could say that the air "pressure"  hitting
       your ear drum  at  any  given  moment  is  varying--and  this is the
       mechanism by which sound "waves"  are  transduced  into your hearing
       organs, the ears.

       The waves on  the  surface  of  a  pond  also travel  out  from  the
       disturbing source; but  observe  closely  and you will see that, for
       the most part, the water itself  merely  bobs  up  and  down  in one
       place--the horizontal movement is in the WAVE (the  position  of one
       vertical slice through  the  water  relative  to  the  next adjacent
       slice).  Water waves, as well as  the  waves  in  a  plucked  guitar
       string, are Transverse; that is, they move at right  angles  to  the
       direction of the wave travel itself.

       Well, Maxwell's insight  was  that  his  postulated  Electromagnetic
       wave, being composed  of two 90 degree  separated  fields  "chasing"
       each other through space, would, like water waves,  be  a Transverse
       wave.  Unlike water,  which only bobs up and down, the EM wave would
       contain (at least) TWO components  (electric  and magnetic) at right
       angles to one another.

       If you can visualize a water wave which "waves",  not  only  "up and
       down", but also  "side  to  side",  then  you have some idea of what
       Maxwell was describing.

       Tom Bearden disagrees that there are transverse waves outside of the
       antenna of your  transmitter or receiver.   Like  Nikola  Tesla,  he
       holds to the model of a longitudinal propagation (electrical "sound"
       waves) of "ripples" in the charge density of the 'ether'  or vacuum.
       He credits Frank Golden, his engineer/scientist friend, with

                                      Page 7





       pointing this out to him. (Incidentally, Bearden is NOT referring to
       what he calls a 'scalar' wave only, when he holds to a longitudinal-
       only view.  He  states  emphatically  that  this applies both to his
       special "scalar" stress waves, per  se, AND to what we call a normal
       EM wave, which  he considers to be a 'special' subset  of  a  scalar
       wave.)

       Well then, why  do  our  instruments  appear to MEASURE these right-
       angled components if they're not even there?

       Bearden invokes the analogy of a gyroscope.  Spin a gyroscope, then
       try to tilt it in a given direction.  What happens?  The gyroscope
       PRECESSES and tries to tilt on an  axis  90  degrees  away  from the
       direction you intended for it.

       Bearden says that that's what happens inside a wire.   The electrons
       in a conductor  are  "free",  capable of being knocked down the wire
       from atom to atom as a "current".   Physicists  refer  to them as an
       "electron gas" in  the wire.  But one more thing: They're  spinning,
       just like little  gyroscopes.  So when a "force" pushes on them from
       a certain direction,  they  precess   at   right   angles,   forming
       "precession waves" whose instantaneous direction or polarity depends
       on the changing  density  of  the  incoming longitudinal  wave  that
       caused them to precess.

       Invoking the Quantum Mechanics "paradox", if you will, that whenever
       we MEASURE something,  we  cannot  help but perturb it (and screw up
       the measurement to that extent), and  thus we NEVER ACTUALLY MEASURE
       ANYTHING in an UNBIASED WAY, Bearden maintains that we are, in fact,
       measuring ONLY WHAT GOES ON INSIDE OUR INSTRUMENTS  AS A REACTION TO
       WHAT'S GOING ON  OUTSIDE  OF  THE  PROBE;  we  never  measure things
       directly.  So we THINK we see transverse  waves  in the vacuum, when
       actually all we're doing is seeing the transverse PRECESSION  of the
       electrons in our  measuring  devices.  Interesting, right?  Well, is
       Tom correct?  He may well be.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

                           BUT WHAT ABOUT POLARIZATION?


       If Bearden is correct, that there is no electrical "field" going "up
       and down" (using the example of vertical polarization), and there is
       no magnetic field going "back and  forth"  at  90  degrees to the E-
       field, both TRANSVERSE  or  at  90  degrees  to  the   direction  of
       propagation ("out" from  the  antenna),  but  that  there  is ONLY a
       COMPRESSION/RAREFACTION (longitudinal)  action on the density of the
       'ether', spreading out  from  transmitter to the surrounding  space,
       then my question is:

          WHY DOES  THE VERTICAL OR HORIZONTAL ORIENTATION OF THE RECEIVING
          ANTENNA WITH  RESPECT  TO  THE ORIENTATION  OF  THE  TRANSMITTING
          ANTENNA, AFFECT THE RECEPTION OF THE TRANSMITTED  SIGNAL  AT ALL?
          A longitudinally oriented wave CONTAINS NO INFORMATION THAT WOULD
          "TELL" THE RECEIVING ANTENNA THAT IT OUGHT TO BE ORIENTED ONE WAY
          OR THE  OTHER,  yet  that  is  precisely what we find in the real
          world!  Does Tom Bearden deny this?

       Let's refresh ourselves quickly on  what  we  mean  by Polarization.
       Simply this:  Following the Classical EM model, we define the

                                      Page 8





                     polarization of a wave by measuring the ORIENTATION OF
                     THE ELECTRIC  FIELD  COMPONENT  at  the antenna of the
                     transmitter.

                     Simply put, if the  antenna  consists  of a horizontal
                     wire, parallel to the ground, we have  a  horizontally
                     polarized wave.   Rotating  the wire into the vertical
                     makes the wave polarization vertical.

       Is this just theory, based on Maxwell's transverse concept?  No.  It
       is an observable phenomenon in radio and TV transmission/reception.
       In fact, if you've ever worn a pair of Polaroid sunglasses, you've
       experienced the effect yourself.   Much  of the glare outside in the
       sun can be cut by wearing these glasses, since they  filter  out all
       light waves that  are  scattered  about with different polarizations
       than the one they're designed to  respond  to.   If  you  don't mind
       popping a lens out of your glasses, place it in front  of  the other
       lens, look through  it,  and rotate it.  You will find a place where
       all the light is shut out -- you're looking at a black, opaque lens.
       Continue turning the popped out lens,  and  you'll  begin to see the
       view through the lenses re-appearing, first dimly,  then  back up to
       normal brightness.

       When you had  the  polarizations  of  the  two  lenses at 90 degrees
       apart, your view went black.  Light  could  not  penetrate  the lens
       pair.

       This same effect happens at radio frequencies (RF, of course, is an
       EM wave just as light is).  When a transmitting antenna is oriented
       in the vertical direction, and the receiving antenna is horizontal,
       a MINIMUM of  energy  is  received  at the receiver.   TV  stations'
       antennas are usually  horizontally polarized -- that's why your home
       TV antenna is a series of horizontal  metal  tubes mounted on a boom
       at right angles to the vertical mast holding it up.

       VOR (VHF OMNIRANGE)  antennas  on airplanes are horizontal  for  the
       same reason.  Radio  stations  tend to use vertical towers (vertical
       polarization).

       It is even  possible  to  produce   circularly-   and  elliptically-
       polarized EM waves using suitable antennas.

       Even more exotic is POLARIZATION MODULATION, used in some advanced
       systems, where the polarization of the carrier wave  varies  in step
       with the information,  just as in AM the Amplitude of the carrier is
       modulated.

       My point is  that polarization OCCURS,  like  it  or  not,  and  the
       Transverse Wave Model  seems  to explain it most satisfactorily,  as
       far as I am aware.

       How does Bearden's  denial  of  the transverse wave in vacuum square
       with this known phenomenon of polarization?

           BEARDEN WANTS US TO UNDERSTAND AND BELIEVE; SO I'LL CALL HIM!

       Well, my 3rd  call  was  cut  short because Mr. Bearden was having a
       meeting that night  and  he had no  time.   Already  feeling  a  bit
       guilty, I said I'd call back in a few days when he wasn't busy.

       About 3 days later, feeling just a little bit like a pest, I dialed
       Bearden's number again  on  Sunday  evening,  April   4th.   Bearden
       answered the phone.   As  politely as I could, I announced who I was
       and that I just had one more question  that  I needed help with, and
       that I'd promise not to call too often after that.  Not that Bearden
       had indicated that I was becoming a nuisance; just  that  I'd talked
       to him for a half-hour the previous week, and maybe three days after
       that, I'd called him again, only to have him tell me he was too busy
       to talk -- he was in a meeting at the moment.  So here I thought I'd
       try one more time on this fine Sunday evening to ask Tom Bearden how
       he would reconcile  the  phenomenon  of radio wave polarization with
       his view of  a  solely LONGITUDINAL  wave  propagation  through  the
       "vacuum" between a standard radio transmitter and receiver.

       Bearden began by asking me if I knew what Newton's Third Law was.  I
       answered that I thought it was the 'action-reaction'  law,  which he
       agreed that it   was.    He  then  began  saying  that  the  present
       electromagnetics is flawed because  it  violates that Newtonian law.
       That we DO detect transverse waves-- but only in the electron gas of
       our antennnas and instrument probes.  That 'not one of the equations
       attributed to Maxwell  were  actually  written  by him'  etc.,  etc.
       Having read three  of  his books and all of his papers as downloaded
       from the BBS's,  I'd  heard these  phrases  many  times  before.   I
       understood the phrases.   Bearden  knew  who  I  was   by  now,  and
       therefore didn't need  to  keep parroting them every time we talked.
       What I wanted  to know was, How does  the  longitudinal  propagation
       theory account for  the KNOWN FACT that EM waves are  polarized  one
       way or another,  and  so  your receiving antenna's polarization (or,
       ORIENTATION) must match  that  of   the   transmitter   for  optimum
       reception.

       That's all I  wanted  to  know.   I just wanted Bearden  to  explain
       polarization in terms of his longitudinal model.

       Evidently I pissed him off.

       He told me  that  I was just regurgitating what "they" had taught me
       in the standard electromagnetics courses.   That I shouldn't believe
       them.  That I should read and re-read his books to  get straightened
       out on these points.

       I felt he was evading my question.  I was asking about polarization.
       If he didn't  know  the  answer,  or  if  he  hadn't  considered the
       question before, or even if he didn't  feel like talking to me about
       it, he could have politely told me so.  I would have  accepted that.
       Everyone who has  a  theory  is  allowed to develop it.  Rome wasn't
       built in a day.

       Next, Tom Bearden was attempting to tell me that polarization itself
       was "a bunch of bullshit"!  Trying  to get a word in edgewise, while
       trying to remain  polite (after all, I was making  the  phone  call,
       intruding on his  time),  I  reminded him that his books didn't DEAL
       with polarization.  He said he didn't HAVE to, because it was all

                                      Page 10





       bullshit.  That I needed to THINK (emphasis his), and that if I were
       really paying attention  to  what  he was saying, I would understand
       and wouldn't be asking these ILLOGICAL questions!

       Still hearing no attempt to answer my question about polarization, I
       tried to define what I meant by it.  I tried to use the illustration
       of a TV station, whose antenna is  usually horizontally polarized --
       and thus your  home  TV  antenna  on your roof is also  horizontally
       polarized.

       But Bearden doesn't let you finish most of your sentences.  Instead,
       he is parroting more phrases such as you find throughout his books.

       By this point,  he  was  actually telling me that, sorry, but when a
       caller such as myself constantly repeats  the same question over and
       over, or from  a different angle, then he must get  tough  with  the
       caller and tell  him  point  blank  that  his questions are bullshit
       questions.  And that I was 'not going  to get him to ADMIT' to there
       being such a  thing  as  wave polarization, as if doing  so  was  to
       'surrender' to those  people  who  hold  to  the  Transverse EM wave
       theory.  God forbid!

       Now I was beginning to wonder if this  guy  was paranoid.  I thought
       of ufologist Jacques  Vallee who would try and try  to  ask  simple,
       polite but firm  questions  of people like Bill Cooper or Bob Lazar.
       When they would begin to squirm, he  would  press them just a little
       bit more.  Not to be an S.O.B., just to cut through  the  fluff  and
       get to see  if there was really anything to the whole thing.  Vallee
       recounts how he would sometimes be  accused,  afterwards, of working
       for the CIA or some other "government" group hated  by the UFO 'true
       believers'.

       So now, here  I  was,  being  informed  by  Tom  Bearden  that I was
       attempting to get him to 'admit'  to  a  'doctrine' of classical EM,
       which he would not.  I was a Roman Catholic Inquisitor trying to get
       Galileo to recant his position and admit that the heavens do revolve
       around a stationary earth.  Oy vay!

       Feeling exasperated, I paused for a moment.  Bearden paused, too.  I
       then said, "Mr.  Bearden,  I  am not trying to get  you  to  'admit'
       anything.  I'm just  trying  to  understand  how to fit polarization
       into your longitudinal view..."

       "It's NOT just my view.  Nikola Tesla  himself held to 'sound waves'
       in the ether..."

       "I didn't mean that it was just YOUR view, Mr. Bearden..."

       "It is the CORRECT view..."

       Now I was thinking of my boss at work.  He never lets me finish what
       I'm saying, either.

       Finally I asked him, "Mr. Bearden, may I make a REQUEST of you then?
       In your future  writings,  would  you please at least  ADDRESS  this
       problem of how   polarization   is  explained  in  the  longitudinal
       model..."

       "No I will NOT!" Bearden said with some conviction. "I get letters

                                      Page 11





       all the time from people with fifty questions and who want all their
       questions answered..."

       I interrupted HIM  this  time:  "Yes,  and when you go public as you
       have and write  books that challenge  the  present  'system  ',  and
       encourage a new  generation  of bright young physicists  to  embrace
       this Scalar EM  and  thereby "overturn the present Physics", YOU HAD
       BETTER EXPECT TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS  TO  BACK  UP YOUR ASSERTIONS
       when people call or write, asking for more detail..."

       He told me once more to read his books again, because  he  would not
       answer anyone's questions if (like mine) they were repetitions of an
       ILLOGICAL question to begin with.

       There was no  more  to  be  gained by pressing this conversation.  I
       said, with a sigh, "Thank you for  your help, Mr. Bearden", and hung
       up the phone.

       Obviously, I won't be 'pestering' the honorable Mr. Tom Bearden with
       my silly phone calls again, unless he decides to lower  himself down
       to my humble  intellectual  level  and, in his great mercy, throw me
       but a crumb from the table on which  sits  the  bounteous  feast  of
       Beardenian Electromagnetics.

       I guess since I'm not a member of the Mensa Society,  as Bearden is,
       I can only be classified as lower than a "degenerate semiconductor".
       I suppose it's   the   slow  "drift  velocity"  at  which  knowledge
       propagates through the electron gas  in  my cerebral cortex.  And it
       keeps precessing sideways, instead of sinking in.

       Anyway, Be it known both to Mr. Tom Bearden and to you, good reader,
       that I hold nothing against Bearden personally.  The man definitely
       seems to be a genius in many ways, even if his table  manners  could
       use some polishing up.

       I believe he is on to something real and with big consequences for
       21st Century Physics,  once  we  take  up  his challenge to test his
       theories in the lab.  Just don't call him up with any questions that
       tend to rock his boat, or you may  be  branded "illogical".  He is a
       rugged Pioneer; we 'young-uns' are going to have to  be the ones who
       bring methodical, point-by-point  analysis and proof to bear on this
       Scalar Electromagnetics.

       Pioneers are lone trail-blazers  who  have  had  to  fight  off  the
       establishment for all of their pioneering careers,  and  they've got
       to be committed  to  their  cause,  even  to  the point of religious
       dogmatism.  The upside of this is  that  lesser souls have a shining
       light to follow.  The down-side is that the pioneer  creates a dogma
       that rivals the  one  he  broke  away  from  and  made  a  career of
       criticizing.  It's human nature, I guess.

       It seems to me that, even if Bearden (and, yes, Tesla also) is wrong
       on the mode of propagation-- if EM  does  have transverse components
       through the vacuum, and not solely longitudinal-- most  of his other
       gripes with classical  EM  have the solid support of Quantum Physics
       behind them and show the classical  EM model to be useful, yet quite
       wrong in many of its fundamentals.

       In the meantime I want to remind those of you who, like me, think

                                      Page 12





       that Bearden is  mostly  correct  and  that the scientific community
       needs to re-examine  the  foundations   of  Electromagnetics:   This
       "copping an attitude"  bullshit  as  exhibited by Tom  Bearden  just
       won't wash with  the  real  world.   We  need  to  come  up  with an
       electromagnetic theory that      properly     explains     empirical
       observations, such as  the phenomenon of wave polarization.   As  of
       this writing, April  1993,  the  Transverse  Wave model of Maxwell's
       Electromagnetics continues to  be   the  best  explanation  of  wave
       polarization.  I was  hoping  to find out that Bearden's  EM  theory
       explains it better;  unfortunately, he refuses to discuss it at all.
       This is kid  stuff  and has no place  in  a  respectable  scientific
       theory.  As long as honest inquirers keep getting rebuffed the way I
       did by Bearden, he cannot expect to be taken seriously by anyone.

       Can anyone explain  wave  polarization via Tom Bearden's  Scalar  EM
       theory?
