        This is  a  story  from a book called FOIBLES AND FALLACIES OF
               SCIENCE, written by Mr.Daniel Hering in 1924.

    History relates several types of  perpetual  motion machines.  The
    inventor's motives range from the ideal of pure  invention  to  an
    attempt to defraud the public. Perpetual motion machines have been
    traced back for several hundred years.

    As of this  date  there  has  been  no  known account of a working
    perpetual motion machine which can  be  built  and demonstrated by
    anyone other than  the  inventor.  Although, we  have  heard  many
    claims, we have  yet  to  see a working model.  This does not rule
    out the possibility  that  one   could   actually   be   made  and
    practically demonstrated.

    The U.S.Patent Office  receives about one hundred  applications  a
    year on perpetual motion machines but they are usually rejected by
    the office, without research into their workability.

    The keywords which bring about the rejection are perpetual motion.

          THE LIQUEFACTION OF AIR AND THE HOPES IT AROUSED ;

                 PERPETUAL MOTION OF THE SECOND KIND

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

         Why should   a   little   matter   like  the  second  law  of
    thermodynamics obstruct the  path  to  perpetual  motion  when  we
    consider what we might achieve if we could be rid of it?

         The boundless possibilities growing out of the achievement of
    perpetual motion were   too   fascinating,   its   unlimited   and
    uncomplaining response to  the heightened complexity and increased
    demands of modern civilization was  too  satisfying  for  it to be
    abandoned, and every advance in science stimulated the hope that a
    new principle would  do  away  with  the  limitations  imposed  by
    earlier partial and imperfect knowledge.

         By 1895   gases   had   been   liquefied   by  the  so-called
    regenerative method with  less difficulty  and  expense  than  had
    before been possible;  Mr.  Charles  E. Tripler of  New  York  had
    devised apparatus for  the  liquefaction of air in large quantity,
    and a popular article concerning  Mr. Tripler's laboratory and his
    remarkable work was  published  in  McClure's Magazine  for  March
    1899.   This article,  written  by Mr. Ray Stannard Baker, then of
    the editoral staff  of  the  magazine,  contained  some  startling
    statements and one  especially which meant the refutation  of  the




    second law of  thermodynamics and the achievement of the perpetual
    motion.


    Mr. Tripler said :

         " I have actually made about  ten gallons of liquid air in my
           liquifier by the use of about three gallons  in  my engine.
           There is, therefore, a surplusage of seven gallons that has
           cost me nothing, and which I can use elsewhere as power."

         The very  cold liquid air in the boiler of an engine would be
    vaporized and have high pressure  under  the heating effect of the
    atmosphere, without any  other  fuel,  and  the  air   thus  under
    pressure would drive  the  engine  which,  in turn, would compress
    more air to be liquefied and employed for power purposes.  The use
    of air for driving the engine constituted  no difficulty either in
    theory or practice, but according to accepted ideas of science, as
    much work would be required in compressing the air  and  depriving
    it of heat as the air could possibly restore in again reaching its
    normal pressure and  temperature.  Still,  there was Mr. Tripler's
    statement which he offered to verify in his laboratory.

         At the invitation of McClure's  Magazine, through Mr.  Baker,
    two professors, heads of the departments of Physics  and Chemistry
    in a prominent  university,  visited  Mr.  Tripler's laboratory to
    witness such a  demonstration.    The   visit,   though   made  by
    appointment, proved to be not conveniently timed  for Mr. Tripler,
    and nothing came  of  it  except a brief comment from each of them
    criticizing Mr. Tripler's  claims.   This  the  magazine  did  not
    publish, and the  exploitation  of  liquid  air  and  its  wonders
    continued.  Those who  had declared war to the death on the second
    law of thermodynamics were elated and exultant.

         Mr. Tripler  resented calling  his  invention  a  scheme  for
    perpetual motion -  always  insisting  that  the   heat   of   the
    atmosphere was a  furnace  for  his  liquid  air, and consistently
    refusing to admit that he lost any  power  in getting the air to a
    temperature below that  of the surrounding bodies,  i.e.,  denying
    the validity of  the second law of thermodynamics. The promises of
    the liquid air scheme were alluring  -bewilderingly  so  - and its
    friends were loath to give up the hopes based upon them. Posing as
    an exemption from  a  painful  but  inexorable law,  this  fallacy
    lingered for several years and died hard.

         Another example  of  the "second kind" of perpetual motion is
    found in a pamphlet entitled "Die  Perpetuum  mobile  Theorie," by
    Franz Hoffmann, of Saalfeld Prussia.  It was published in Leipzig,
    in 1912, there  years after an international aviation  contest  at
    Rheims, in which the Germans were worsted and two years before the
    outbreak of the great world war.

         It is a rather involved scheme which winds up with this naive
    bit of patriotic sentiment :

         " Anyone  who cannot understand that, there is no help for, -
           it will happen with him just as with certain gentlemen who,
           some ten years ago, had not  been able to understand that a
           body that   was   essentially   heavier  than   air   could
           nevertheless lift  itself  free in the air. The consequence
           of this intellectual debility  was  that three years ago in
           Rheims we had to let Messieurs Frenchmen and  Americans fly




           away from  us  instead of the Germans leading the remaining
           nations in flying.

         " Perhaps a gracious fate  may  preserve  poor  Germany  from
           another Rheims  humiliation that will come  from  the  fact
           that not  until  other  nations arrive in Hamburg or Bremen
           with their  `perpetual  motion'   ships,  will  the  German
           Michael awake from his lethargy."

         He implores  every  reader  who  still  has  any  regard  for
    Germany's name and  honor  to  do  what  he  can that, at least in
    respect to perpetual motion, Germany  may remain in advance of the
    other nations!

    Jerry Decker and I will be working on some drawings  that  can  be
    included into some  of  the articles. The current problem involves
    the time necessary to scan and edit the images as well as choosing
    the graphic formats (.PCX, .TIF,  etc..)  to  use which will allow
    everyone to view them easily.
