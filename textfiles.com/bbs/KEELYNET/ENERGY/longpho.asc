                      Experiments with Longitudinal Radiation

       Detection and generation   of   longitudinal   photons  as  discrete
       entities may be  facilitated  by   a   relatively  simple  technique
       employing conductive screens to filter out the transverse components
       of impinging radiation.

       The wavelengths which may be filtered are directly  proportional  to
       the spacing of  the  mesh,  so  that  ordinary  window  screens, for
       example, will readily filter out  waves  in  the  centimeter  range,
       i.e., microwaves.

       On a smaller  scale,  waves  in the range of visible  light  may  be
       blocked by polarizing  filters,  so that any wave transmitted by the
       filter must be either longitudinal  or  of shorter length than those
       of visible light. In physics calculations, longitudinal  photons are
       usually negated by  a  gauge  transformation. Thus transformed, they
       become simple Coulomb fields.

       Nevertheless, there are   some    physical   situations   in   which
       longitudinal components must be dealt with in their own right.

       Nuclear interactions, both weak and strong, owe their  existence  in
       large part to  the  action of virtual particles which are dominantly
       longitudinal in character.

       In a 1969 paper from Russia (1),  the  generation  and  detection of
       longitudinal photons is addressed in an experiment designed to yield
       an estimate of  the  lower  limit  of the photon's  rest  mass.  The
       authors propose a device constructed from two oscillating circuits
       which are linked   by   a  common  capacitor  with  a  metal  screen
       interposed between the capacitor's separate plates.

       The experiment measures extra low  and  ultra  low frequencies to an
       accuracy commensurate with   a  period  of  (3*10^-3/sec),   roughly
       equivalent to the  conductivity  period  of  the  free  vacuum.  The
       accuracy estimate assumes a generated  frequency  of  10^5  Hz  at a
       power rating of 40 watts, with the detection cycle  equal to roughly
       10^6 seconds.



                                      Page 1





       The ratio of  the common capacitance squared, divided by the product
       of the separate circuit capacitances is equal to roughly 10.

       Synchronous detection with the generator  signal  allows  transverse
       and longitudinal components   to  measured  separately.   The   long
       detection cycle compensates for the signal-to-noise ratio.

       Notwithstanding the minute frequency which the authors of the paper
       seek to detect, their experiment bears a direct relation to rumored
       experiments of much higher power.

       Col. Tom Bearden,   USAF   Ret.,   suggests  that  Russian  military
       experiments of the   early   1960's   employed   scalar/longitudinal
       interferometry to project  high  energy pulses at long  range,  thus
       creating a highly destructive weapon.

       (2) Whether or   not   this   is   true,   the   appearance  of  the
       aforementioned paper from 1969 indicates that the principles of such
       weapons were likely well understood  in Russia outside of the narrow
       realm of classified research.

       Properly scaled up,  the  conductive screen used in  the  low  power
       experiment could be placed in front of a broadcast antenna to filter
       out transverse waves and project pure longitudinal radiation.

       Avalanche discharge generates  copious  quantities  of  longitudinal
       photons, so spark gap units might  be used in conjunction with tuned
       frequencies.

       When the output of such an antenna intersects a similar output froma
       second transmitter, the  longitudinal  components of  the  radiation
       recouple to produce  an  implosive "energy bottle" whose effects are
       devastating at high intensities. There are, however, more productive
       uses of this principle in the field of energy production.

       One application of  the  "energy bottle"  effect  which  immediately
       springs to mind is the economical generation of "hot" fusion.

       An approach currently  in vogue utilizes high-powered  lasers  in  a
       spherically symmetrical array to rapidly compress the deuterium fuel
       of a small  glass pellet. Lithium niobate crystals are configured to
       double or quadruple the frequency  output of lower frequency lasers,
       so that the  radiation  striking  the  pellet  is  as  energetic  as
       possible.

       The longitudinal approach  suggests that crossed polarizing filters,
       such as transparent crystals with  an  appropriate  lattice spacing,
       could be employed to enhance the implosive effect of  the  colliding
       beams.

       On a more  exotic  note, zero-point energy might be more efficiently
       tapped by the assisted collapse of high density plasma in a reaction
       vessel with cubic symmetry. A set  of  six  orthogonal  emitters  of
       variable frequency tuned  to the desired plasma resonance  could  be
       pulsed to first implode, and then rotate the ions of the plasma into
       a three-dimensional convective assembly.  (See M. King, "Tapping the
       Zero-Point Energy").

       The cycloidal motion   of  the  ions  thus  induced  (theoretically)
       enhances the production of virtual charge within the plasma.

       Moreover, the longitudinal  radiation   itself  may  couple  to  the
       induced virtual charge  within  the  plasma  and thus  increase  the
       reaction further. In an ideal device, ions are fed into the reaction
       chamber until the desired density is achieved.

       Properly phased pulses   are   then  applied  to  the  plasma  at  a
       predetermined frequency. High-frequency    ultrasound    might    be
       introduced to mechanically supplement the electromagnetic pulses.

       A Russian researcher  (3) reports a gain of near 400%  in  a  plasma
       device wherein cold   plasma   is  allowed  to  collapse  under  the
       influence of zero-point pressure.

       The approach outlined here suggests that one may amplify this effect
       by drawing some of the generated  energy  to  power the longitudinal
       transmitters and ultrasound  transducers.  Even   a   small  wattage
       impressed upon a  self  sustaining  reaction  should,  in principle,
       increase the efficiency and controllability of the reaction.
