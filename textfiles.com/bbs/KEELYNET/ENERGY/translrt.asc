       Overview:

           Before we  begin,  for those of you new to the art, a translator
           is a device which can 'convert'  EM  energy  into SCALAR or vice
           versa.

           When coverting EM energy to SCALAR, what you are  actually doing
           is attempting  to  create  a  subtructure in which the energy is
           folded in on itself in such a  way that it manifests no external
           net effects  in the manner in which our current  test  equipment
           (single stage  interaction)  is  designed to detect, but rather,
           maintains all  of  its energy  within  the  substructure  itself
           (hyperspace), in other words, SCALAR WAVES.

           These types   of   waves  are  quite  capable   of   penetrating
           conventional forms   of   em  shielding  (Faraday  Cages)  while
           remaining quite invisible to standard  (single  stage) detection
           methods.

                                      Page 1





           They are  created  by deliberately opposing the E and/or B field
           components of ordinary em waves.   Devices designed to encourage
           this type of wave formation are called TRANSLATORS.

           A translator which can only convert EM to scalar or scalar to EM
           is known  as  a  'one-way' device.  There are certain  types  of
           translators which  are  capable  of converting freely from EM to
           scalar and back.  These devices  are known as 'two-way' devices.
           Lets take a closer look at some of the one-way devices.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                                ONE-WAY TRANSLATORS
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

           A one  way  translator  (EM-scalar)  is  extremely   simple   to
           construct.  In  fact, the typical home or apartment is literally
           FULL of these devices now!  Consider  the  common  two conductor
           lamp cord used on many lights, small appliances, and radios.

           This cord  is  commonly  referred   to as 'zip  cord'.   As  the
           current surges  through  the  first  wire,  the  second  wire is
           carrying the return current in  the  opposite direction.  The EM
           fields whirling about the conductors are in opposition.

           Up until now, most of you were taught that the  fields, while in
           opposition, 'cancel'  each   other out.  Does this mean that the
           energy contained in those fields is destroyed?  OF COURSE NOT!

           We CANNOT destroy energy.  We  CAN  cause  it to change its form
           and this  is  precisely what happens when fields  in  opposition
           'cancel' out.

           As the  current  oscillates  through  the  wires, an oscillating
           SCALAR WAVE results.  If a direct current is applied to the wire
           pair, a 'static' scalar EM field results.

       Wire Pair Translator:

           Tests have  shown that the 'zip  cord'  described  above,  while
           conducting a 60 cycle alternating current, will  generate  a 120
           cycle scalar em wave.

           Here we  have  the  first  (and  perhaps the most basic) type of
           translating device.   A single  conductor  folded  in  half  and
           parallel will produce a scalar wave if it is fed  energy from an
           alternating current  source.   This  basic  translator is at the
           heart of the next device.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

                                 >>> Figure A <<<

       Non-Inductive (Bifilar) Translator:

           Let us now take our simple translator and wind it into a helical
           shape.  We have just created  what  is  commonly known as a non-
           inductive (bifilar)  coil.   Such  coils  are   copious  one-way
           emitters of these waves as well.


                                      Page 2





           Unlike the   simple   translator   above   which   will  produce
           horizontally or vertically polarized  scalar waves (depending on
           their orientation to the ground plane), this type  of translator
           will produce circularly polarized scalar waves.

           A variation  of this type of translator is to wind the coil on a
           45 degree angle up and down the  length  of  the form creating a
           series of  90  degree  intersections  where the  windings  cross
           (caduceus coil).

           These types  of  translators  (which  can also be wound at other
           angles to facilitate the production  of  different  wave  types)
           tend to  create 'free' A, 'free' B, or 'free'  E  fields   which
           have been  separated  from  the  em  source  wave  by  selective
           cancellation of the unwanted component fields of the source
           wave.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

                                 >>> Figure B <<<

       Bucking Coil Translator:

           Another type  of  translator   that  I  have  experimented  with
           consists of  two coils (air-core) arranged so  that  the  fields
           oppose or 'buck' against one another.

           All that  is  necessary  for  this  translator to produce scalar
           waves is an alternating source  of  current with the coils wired
           so that the north and south poles created by  the  coils  oppose
           each other.

           The region  between the coils where the north/south poles oppose
           is known as the ZPE (zero-point  energy)  zone.  Although scalar
           substructures are created in the zpe, this type of translator is
           not exceptionally efficient due to the flux leakage at the other
           end of the coils.  (The accompanying diagram will clarify this.)

           This was  one  of  the two types of translators  discovered  and
           examined by  Nikola  Tesla.  If you refer to his 1904 lecture in
           London, you will notice that the  demonstration  coil Tesla used
           which was encased in a zinc box (Faraday Cage),  had a secondary
           coil that consisted of two halves wound oppositely.

           The coils  as  described  in  that book would have created a zpe
           zone between  them.   The  field  would  have  been  capable  of
           penetrating the zinc box, (whereas normal em  waves  would  not)
           and this is most likely how Tesla stumbled onto it.  There is at
           least one  other  translator  Mr.  Tesla  stumbled onto which we
           shall discuss next.

       Lenzs' Law Translator:

           In Tesla's Colorado Springs diary  (1899-1900)  he noted that he
           was experiencing a problem in keeping the top turns of his coils

                                      Page 3





           from shorting  out  due  to  breakdown  of the insulation on the
           wires under the high electric potential he was creating.

           In effect, the top turns were  shorted,  closed  loop conductors
           positioned on top of the operating section of the  coil.  If you
           ever had   physics   in   high  school,  you  will  remember  Le
           Chatelier's Principle:

              WHENEVER WE  UNDERTAKE  ANY  ACTION  TO  CHANGE  AN  EXISTING
              PHYSICAL SYSTEM, THE SYSTEM REACTS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO
              OPPOSE OUR ACTION.

           By applying this principle to the interactions  of  currents and
           magnetic fields,  we  have Lenzs' Law.  This means the the field
           being radiated  by the operating  (un-shorted)  portion  of  the
           Tesla oscillator, caused a counter field of opposite  energy  to
           be created in the shorted turns.

           The zone  between the functioning and reciprocating areas of the
           coil is a zpe zone very similar  to  the  zone  created  in  the
           bucking coil  translator.  This was the second  translator  that
           Tesla had  discovered.   By constructing a Tesla oscillator, and
           fixing a shorted loop to the top, we may produce powerful scalar
           emissions.

       Multiple Antenna Translator:

           This method  of  producing scalar  waves  lends  itself  to  the
           production of  powerful  scalar  beams  which  can  be  used  in
           military (weapon) applications.

           The basic idea here is to use pairs or arrays of antennae spaced
           at 1/4  or 1/2  wave intervals, and possibly log-periodic arrays
           and yagi-type configurations  as  well,  which are fed rf energy
           and  wired  in  such  a way as to cause total or  partial  phase
           conjugation of the waves projected from them.

           The antennae  may consist of any combination of the antennae now
           in use for communications in  any  band  desired.    Consult the
           Radio Amateurs  Handbook  for antenna types and  configurations.
           The possibilities  here  are alomost endless and are well beyond
           the scope of this text.

       Le Chatelier's Principle

            Let us  perturb  a  system   which   is   initially  in  stable
            equilibrium to a neighboring non-equilibrium state.   Since the
            initial equilibrium  is  supposed to be stable, the system will
            return to an equilibrium state.

            Theorems governing the behavior  of perturbed systems are often
            known as "theorems of constraint" or "theorems  of moderation."
            The best  known  thermodynamic theorem of moderation is that of
            Le Chatelier-Braun which in the form stated by Le Chatelier is:

               "Any system in chemical equilibrium  undergoes,  as a result
                of a  variation  in  one  of  the  factors   governing  the
                equilibrium, a  COMPENSATING  CHANGE  in  a  direction such
                that, had this change occurred alone it would have produced
                a variation  of  the  factor  considered  in  the  OPPOSITE
                DIRECTION."

            However, this  principle  suffers  from a number  of  important
            exceptions.  it   is   therefore   preferable   to   study  the
            "moderation" starting from the  usual  thermodynamic  formalism
            without invoking a special principle.

                          *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

       Lenz' Law

            A general law of electrodynamic induction, stated  by  H. F. E.
            Lenz in  1833.   It  points  out  that  the electromotive force
            induced by the variation of magnetic  flux, with reference to a
            conductor, in the manner discovered by Faraday,  is  always  in
            such direction  that,  if  it  produces a current, the magnetic
            effect of that current opposes  the  flux variation responsible
            for both electromotive force and current.

            An outstanding  illustration  is  the  drag   on   a  generator
            armature; if  the  armature  circuit is closed, the rotation is
            opposed by a torque arising from the reaction between the field
            and the current in the armature conductors.

            Power must therefore be applied  to  drive the machine; and the
            greater the armature current, the more power is required.

            The effect  known as MAGNETIC DAMPING also depends  upon  Lenz'
            law.

            A copper  disk, when spun between the poles of a strong magnet,
            quickly comes to rest because  of  the  opposing  torque.  This
            arrangement serves as a speed regulator in watt-hour meters.
