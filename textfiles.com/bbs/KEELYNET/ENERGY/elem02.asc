       Given the heated  debate  about  Bob  Lazar and his claims about the
       existence of element 115, I found a very interesting article in the
       paper.  Just when we think we know  everything  about physics, those
       darn scientists keep running experiments that upset our "knowledge."

       I have included the article in its entirety.  Any and all typos are
       mine, since I typed this in by hand.  And by the  way,  the  Russian
       scientist's name _IS_ LAZARev - I'm not playing a funny here.

                        SCIENTISTS MAKE ELEMENTAL DISCOVERY
         U.S.-Russian team sheds new light on theories of atomic stability
                    by Charles Petit - Chronicle Science Editor

       Russian and American scientists are reporting that, using a powerful
       cyclotron in a  lab  north  of  Moscow, they may have found a way to
       break a scientific log jam blocking  efforts to make elements beyond
       the 109 now known.

       The new work suggests that extremely heavy elements,  virtually  all
       of them man-made  and  never seen in nature, can be much more stable
       than believed, making it easier to extend the list of elements.

       The scientists did not make a new  element  but  say they did make a
       handful of atoms of element 106 with an unprecedented number of the
       subatomic particles called  neutrons  in their centers.   The  atoms
       lasted as long  as  30  seconds  or even longer before spontaneously
       disintegrating in radioactive decay.

       Element 106, which has no formal name, was first reported nearly 20
       years ago by  a  team  at the University  of  California's  Lawrence
       Berkeley Laboratory, but the Berkeley version had  a  half  life  of
       less than a second and also had few neutrons in its core.

          "The goal  was  to  be  at  the limits of nuclear physics,  where
           theory is stretched to the extreme of what we can understand,"

       said Ronald Lougheed, a leader of  the  effort  and  chemist  at the
       Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

          "What our results indicate is that things are  much  more  stable
           out there than the usual theories would have predicted."

       An element's atomic  number  refers  to  the  number of electrically
       charged protons in its nucleus.  The nucleus also contains a similar
       or larger number of neutrons, which  have  about  the  same  mass as
       protons but no electric charge.

       Since discovery of 106, German scientists have managed  after  great
       effort to create  in  the laboratory elements 107, 108, and 109, but
       each disintegrates in fractions of a second.

       Worry had grown that elements heavier  than  109 might be impossible
       to make.

       If so, it would bring to an end an intellectual journey  to discover
       all chemical elements  permitted  by  the  laws  of nature.  It is a
       quest begun by  ancient civilizations  such  as  the  Greeks  -  who
       believed all things are combinations of earth, air, fire, and water.

       Modern science recognizes  92  natural  elements, from  hydrogen  at
       number 1 through  uranium  at 92.  Since the 1940s, 17 more elements
       have been created, including plutonium,  neptunium,  lawrencium, and
       einsteinium that are even heavier.

       Lougheed spoke during an interview at the laboratory  that  included
       two members of  the  Russian  portion  of  the  collaboration,  Yuri
       Lazarev and Vladimir Utyonkov of  the  Joint  Institute  for Nuclear
       Research at Dubna, some 90 miles north of Moscow.   The results were
       first described to  a small meeting in Finland in the spring and are
       being submitted to publication in  the  journal  Physical  Review C.
       Lazarev is also  leading  a  symposium  on  them this  week  at  the
       Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.

       Although preliminary, the work inspires intense excitement among the
       relative handful of scientists who still pursue the hunt for ever-
       heavier, more exotic elements.

          "Boy, I hope they are right.  This gives a whole new twist to it
           (theories of atomic stability).  I would get busy right now if I
           had a machine to work with,"

       said Albert Ghiorso, a senior Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory physicist
       who has been  a  major figure in creation of man-made elements since
       the 1940s.

       There is no sure practical payoff to the research.

       Lazarev said, however, that the behavior of atomic nuclei under the
       extreme stress created  by  interaction   of  so  many  protons  and
       neutrons will help scientists understand the nature  of  more common
       elements.

       The scientists base their conclusions on only a small bit of data.
       They ran the  cyclotron,  a  form of subatomic particle accelerator,
       for 16 straight days in April.   Its  intense  beam  of  neon nuclei
       slammed into a  target  of  curium.   The hope was  that  among  the
       trillions of collisions,  a  few  neon and curium nuclei would merge
       into an isotope  of  element  106   with   160  neutrons  that  some
       scientists hypothesized might be unusually stable.

       The evidence of success came from measuring decay products, called
       alpha rays, released by atoms as they decay.  Only  four  alpha rays
       of the computed  energy  were detected.  Factoring in the efficiency
       of the Livermore-supplied detector,  the  scientists  estimate  they
       made about 150 neutron-rich atoms of element 106.

          "We were at the extremes of what is possible with  both  U.S. and
           Russian physics," Lazarev said.  "These experiments are terribly
           hard."

       The U.S. Department  of  Energy  recently  ordered a shutdown of the
       only remaining accelerator  in  Berkeley,  the  super-Hiliac,  which
       would have been able to confirm or extend the work.
