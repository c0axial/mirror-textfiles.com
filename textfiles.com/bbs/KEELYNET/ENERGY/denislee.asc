           SOME INFORMATION ON THE DENNIS LEE "PHASE CHANGE" MACHINE

                                April 12, 1992

        Note: This is an interview between Jim Davis and Bob Aldrich,
              Sysop of the Survivor Club BBS in Los Angeles; 1-213-663-1301
              Jim saw the machine in question and this is his report on it.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

            Q: When did you see this device?

            A: Two years ago, in Ventura.

            He had a 500 gallon tank of water, and the idea was to see
       how much... He was running a compressor with a wattmeter on the
       wall, and we could measure the amount of electricity it took to
       raise the temperature seventy degrees in the tank of water, so we
       could calculate the BTU's it took to raise the temperature of the
       water, and we could calculate the watts out of the power lines, and
       when we did the calculation; we had gotten out of the plates on the
       roof an equivalent of eight times what we got out of the power
       plug.

            Q: How was the system set up?

            A: There was a compressor; seven plates on the roof, (three
       or four feet wide by seven feet long); this compressor pushed
       refrigerant through the plates on the roof, and when it would come
       down and the compressor compressed it, heat would come out, and it
       was a very short run from there into the tank of water, a big
       insulated thing, 500 gallons. It (pipes) went into the tank of
       water and dumped the heat into it.

            Q: How long did it take to heat this tank up?

            A: Forty Minutes, not long, it was fast.

            Each of us, about seven of us, got to go up the ladder and
       check the temperature. It was about room temperature to start.


                                      Page 1





            Then afterwards there was another set of plates down below
       going into a frame box with one inch of full thick insulation and
       a half-inch of plywood. We shoved the plates in there and closed
       the doors and turned the thing on and got the tempurature down to
       minus ten. And we got hot water from inside that box, which was at
       minus ten. Of course there was heat leaking in from outside in the
       room, which was at 65 degrees. But we went out for a lecture and
       came back in an hour or so and we had made forty gallons of hot
       water.

            And then he did something else, he took that minus ten
       refrigerated space and heated up the room with it to show us this
       thing was net-gaining and it wasn't just sucking air out of the
       room. He took the heat from this refrigerator (insulated space) and
       he hooked it up to this blower and heated the room up till it was
       about 75 degrees. That heat was actually being generated from that
       refrigerator. Of course heat was leaking into the refrigerator but
       nevertheless this whole warehouse got warm. The refrigerator got
       down to close to minus twenty. I think the freon was good for just
       down to that point, its boiling point was minus twenty. I was
       impressed, I think it was free energy, myself.

            Q: Free meaning, "Well, there's the heat in the refrigerator,
       let's use it out here.", right?

            A: Yes, well, we transferred it, yes.

            Q: How big was the refrigerator?

            A: Oh, gee, about ten feet by twelve feet by eight feet. It
       was big.

            Q: A walk in.

            A: Yes. He was demonstrating that you could make air
       conditioning in your house. You have a little room, you make it
       cold, maybe it's your refrigerator, you pump that through the rest
       of your house, you've got air-conditioning. You want to make your
       refrigerator cold, your swimming pool hot, you could do that. If
       you wanted to have a sauna, you could pump heat from there to a
       sauna.

            It's neat. (just move the heat around) Then later, what he was
       trying to do was to perfect a way to make electricity out of that
       coefficient of performance of eight, if he could convert that to
       electricity, he could make enough to run the whole system.

            Q: You mean, the power would be coming from out-door heat?

            A: Right.

            Q: And you could run the system. So you would just need a more
       efficient freon-driven generator.

            A: Well, he claims there was a way of making it much more
       efficient; using special lubricants; if he could make the
       compressor the right way, he could make it so it runs at air
       temperature. Right now it's restricted to keep the compressor from
       melting down. Because if you were not to restrict the input of the

                                      Page 2





       freon into the plates, the compressor would get too hot; so the
       compressor has a heat sensor on it, and when it gets too hot it
       just shuts down those valves, to cool the system down. I think it
       could take 207 degrees or something.

            Q: Was there some talk of a ceramic compressor?

            A: Yes. That was another company.

            Q: When was the last time you saw Dennis?

            A: That was the last time. Two years ago.

            Q: What do you call it?

            A: Phase Change. Dennis Lee's Phase Change. A heat pump.

            Q: There must be something different about it; how is it
       different from a regular heat pump?

            A: It's a flat-plate heat pump, it takes you further.

            Q: What do they normally use?

            A: They're around a box, there's a fan in the center. They
       tend to ice up, these (Lee's) don't because the plates are all
       spread out. But really, that's all it is.

            Q: So just more efficient?

            A: Heat pumps are efficient too, but this is more efficient
       because it's spread out, it gets more heat.

            End of interview.

                             Interviewer's Note:

            This is not, of course perpetual motion. Not any more, that
       is, than the spinning of the earth or the burning of the sun is
       perpetual motion. Or perhaps not any more than a gold-miner is
       getting free gold by digging it out of the ground. Of course some
       energy has to be expended to dig it out. Of course a woodcutter has
       to work hard to get some firewood to heat his house. But somehow
       in the scheme of things, the digging for gold or the cutting of
       wood pays for itself. The goldminer cashes his gold at the bank or
       wherever, buys some new clothes, buys food and whiskey, takes a
       woman, later takes some rest, and, so energized, takes the money
       left over to mine more gold! Free energy! It goes the same with a
       woodcutter.  Of course a heat pump would have to expend some energy
       to pump the heat inside, especially when the temperature is colder
       outside than in!

            The point is that there is all this heat floating around in
       the environment just going to waste! Why not use it, and
       efficiently?

            Why get it from a gas pipe when you can get it from the outside

                                      Page 3





       air? Why use electricity when the potential is there to take energy
       from right outside the window? At least if you are going to use
       electricity to heat your refrigerator, you could take that heat and
       heat your water-heater! You get the idea!

       Vangard Note...

          We first came across the activities of Dennis Lee at a Global
          Sciences Conference in Denver Colorado.  At that time, Dennis had
          just been released from prison for fraudulent dealings with his
          heat pump device.  Although we did not speak with him privately,
          we did attend an impromptu presentation at which he mentioned his
          past and made claims regarding his system.  The device was
          promoted ONLY as a means of heating water yet hints were made
          that it had other uses.  It was also claimed that there were
          thousands of units in operation.

          One of the men attending the presentation stood up and accused
          Dennis of ripping him off for about $3000.  He also said many
          others had also been ripped off and warned the audience to not be
          taken in.  This developed into a heated argument between Dennis
          and the man which we all thought might break out into a fight.
          We later spoke with this man and he said Dennis had made claims
          and took his money, but he never saw the device that he had
          "bought".  We now understand that Dennis is sponsoring an '800'
          number offering videotapes of the device for $50.  The idea is
          that you send a check or money order that will not be redeemed as
          long as you return the video.  We have not pursued this offer.

          In support of the concept, we understand that it does indeed work
          quite well despite the shady dealings of its promoters.  The heat
          pump is extremely efficient in the above mentioned configuration
          as told to us by another local resarcher who is working on a
          thermodynamic turbine.  This local researcher informs us that in
          the state of Texas, co-generation techniques that provide power
          to be sold back into the grid need ONLY be purchased if generated
          by CERTAIN SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES.

          Acceptable co-generation techniques include Solar, Geothermal,
          Wind, Nuclear or standard armature-type electrical generators.
          Our inventor friend tells us that heat pumps as co-generators are
          specifically EXCLUDED from the list that power companies are
          required to buy back.  We found that quite interesting...this
          particular inventor feels that he was targeted as his turbine
          device could be used to generate electrical power and so the law
          was made to prevent consumers from making money FROM the power
          company.
