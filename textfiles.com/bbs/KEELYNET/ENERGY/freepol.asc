                 AN OPEN LETTER TO ALL WORKING ON ALTERNATE ENERGY

       November 1, 1991

       Paul Brown
       c/o:  P.O. Box 201.
       Los Altos, CA 94023

       Greetings,

       I have been  involved  with  alternate  energy  research since 1978,
       while still a college student.  Over  the  years  I  have heard many
       nightmare stories about  people who developed something  significant
       only to be persecuted, harassed, prosecuted, and even killed.

       I was sure  that  these  stories  were  exaggerated  or possibly the
       result of the  inventor's own paranoia  or  such.   Further,  I  met
       several inventors whom  I  felt  were their own worst  enemies  (via
       fabrications of their imaginations) which confirmed my beliefs.

       As time went  on,  and  in  about 1982, I became involved in work of
       some significance and received some  minor  criticism and skepticism
       that I found  to be beneficial as well as practical,  but  no  death
       threats or any   of   the  other  forms  of  persecution.   I  built
       experimental devices, learned things unavailable from books, filed
       for patents and in general felt very satisfied with my life, society
       and the scientific system.

                                      Page 1





       However;  things began  to  change, slowly and alarmingly.  The more
       success I had  in  my endeavors  -  the  more  I  began  to  attract
       dishonest and greedy people (I know this now but was  unaware  of it
       then).  My life  became more uncomfortable as time went on but I was
       not sure of the problem.

       In 1987 we decided it was time to  let  the  world know what we were
       working on and the results we were getting.  It was a proud time for
       me.  I thought we were doing the right thing.  But this was the real
       beginning of the worst.

       Since that February 1987 I or my company have been persecuted by the
       State Dept. of Health;
           then the Idaho Dept. of Finance filed a civil complaint  against
           the company and myself;
           my license for handling radioactive materials was then suspended
           for 6 months;
           I began  to  receive  threats (i.e.  "We will bulldoze your home
           with your family in it.");
           securities fraud charges were  then filed against my company and
           myself;
           then investigation by the Oregon Dept. Finance;
           then the tax man;
           then the Securities and Exchange Commission;
           my wife was assaulted;
           I lost control of my company;
           my home has been robbed three times and vandalized on four other
           occasions;
           twice now I have been accused of drug manufacturing;
           I lost my home;
           most recently my mother's car was pipe bombed.

       With each hardship I strive harder toward successful development of
       the technologies under my endeavor.  But it only seems to get worse.

       Someone once said,   "Paranoia  is  only  a  heightened   sense   of
       awareness."  He was  right!   It  is  hard  for  the  average guy to
       comprehend these disasters happening to select people.  I am here to
       tell you it is not coincidence.  I now understand why some inventors
       drop out from society.

       My advice to you is keep a low profile until you have completed your
       endeavor;  be selective in choosing  your business partners; protect
       yourself and your family;  know that the nightmare stories are true.

       R. E. McMaster elegantly summarizes the character of the suffering
       scientist (The Reaper, Vol. 15, No. 36, 9-4-91) *:

         "The history of science and technology, the history of significant
          breakthroughs for mankind, which has launched him  into new eras,
          is the  history  of  'tinkerers', of private individuals who have
          sacrificed their lives, time, money,  reputations and families to
          research and experiment in their garages and basements  in search
          of truths,  the  applications  of which in their hearts they know
          exist ...   These  are  the men  of  passion,  of  character  and
          professionalism -  great  minds, holistic and synergistic  minds,
          blessed with   hands-on   mechanical  skills,  working  to  bring
          scientific theory and concept  into  practical,  working, useful,
          productive technology.

          These are  the  men  whom  a  life,  love,  liberty,  law, light-
          oriented, long-term biased society would lift up.  Unfortunately,
          the character of the modern world is just the opposite of the six
          'Ls'.

          And so men suffer, are persecuted  by the government and culture-
          at-large.  They  scramble  for  funds,  are  abandoned  by  their
          families, suffer  the ridicule of their colleagues, are forced to
          stuff their  thoughts  and keep  their  mouths  shut.   They  are
          lonely.  And  yet, they drive on in their relentless  pursuit  of
          truth to  make  this  scientifically and technologically a better
          world.

          There is something about the non-stop pain of long-term suffering
          which humbly grounds a man in  reality.   Under  such  continuous
          pressure, men  break  and either become bitter or  better.   They
          have neither  the  time nor the interest in the air heads who are
          wrapped up in materialism, conflict  and  leisure  orientation of
          today's world.  Nor do they belong to the group  of  intellectual
          acid-heads who  read  books,  gather facts, and are ever learning
          and talking, but do not have the hands-on skills or the hearts to
          help their friends and fellow man  when the need arises.  Rather,
          such men  are  the  point men, leading the dangerous  platoon  of
          life.  They   are   self-assured  and  have  few  good,  reliable
          friends...  These are the men who challenge the new frontiers and
          the old order to make a better  tomorrow.   These  are the loners
          who have  been  persecuted by both industry and  government,  who
          have endured grave injustices in search of scientific truth."

       God speed, Good Luck in your endeavors, and Never lose The Faith.

       Sincerely,

       Paul Brown

                                   San Diego, CA

       Good morning everyone.  It is indeed a great privilege to be here to
       address you today.  As the keynote  speaker,  I  feel  that I should
       provide some ideas and thoughts which you will keep  in  the back of
       your minds as you listen and participate over the next few days.

                                      Page 3





       I have chosen  to title my address "...And Promises to Keep" which I
       am sure you recognize as coming from  Robert  Frost's  famous  poem,
       Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.  I hope after  I have finished
       speaking, the thoughts that prompted me to select that title will be
       understood.  I liken  my  address to the poem because, like Frost, I
       cannot help but feel that we, you and I and the country we so dearly
       love, have not kept our promises... promises made in previous years,
       by us in the technical community and by our national leaders.

       What were the promises?  Why did we  not  keep them?  And what shall
       we do about  it?  This is my theme.  In 1977, then  President  Jimmy
       Carter declared a  "War for Energy Independence" and we, the keepers
       of the energy grail said, "Yes, we can"  Recall what we said we as a
       Nation would do.  I quote now from  the National Energy Plan of 1977
       and the follow-up  of  1979.   By 1985, we would reduce  our  annual
       energy use growth rate to less than 2 percent per year.

       We were going to reduce our dependence on imported oil to one eighth
       of our total  energy  consumption.  We were going to reduce gasoline
       consumption by 10 percent.  We were  going  to  aggressively promote
       the development of  new technologies for renewable  energy  with  an
       expectation of achieving near 20 percent of our domestic energy from
       renewables by the  year 2000.  Two and one half million homes in the
       U.S. were going to use solar energy by the year 1985.  We were going
       to reduce our energy consumption by 1/2 % through conservation.

       Have we achieved any of these goals?   The  results are mixed.  Some
       we did... but most we did not.  Why not, you ask?   Well  there  are
       several reasons, but  the  main  reason  is simply we, the technical
       community, didn't deliver.   We   didn't   make   the  technological
       breakthroughs we promised.  We have been successful  at  holding our
       annual energy demand growth to below the goal of 2 percent per year,
       primarily through conservation, BUT today, imported oil accounts for
       40 percent of  our  total  energy  consumption, and it's expected to
       climb to 58 percent by the year 2010.   [These  figures give reality
       to the importance of Operation Desert Storm.]

       Our gasoline consumption  has decreased by only 2  percent,  despite
       the introduction of  more  fuel  efficient   vehicles.   In 1991, we
       consumed an average of 16.7 million  barrels of oil per day, up from
       7.3 million barrels  per  day  in  1976.  In 1990, renewable  energy
       accounted for only 8 percent of the energy consumed in the U.S.

       Today less than 1 percent (or less than 1 million homes) in the U.S.
       use solar energy.   We had promised utility sized photovoltaic power
       systems and roof top residential systems.   Where are they?  We said
       by the mid 1990's, we would be producing photovoltaically  generated
       electricity at a  cost  of  around  5  cents per kilowatt-hour.  The
       actual cost, for terrestrial applications is still about an order of
       magnitude higher today.  We are 1000 percent from our promise.

       For wind systems, we promised economically  viable systems.  Without
       the benefit of  legislative  mandates  and  tax  incentives,   these
       systems fall well short of viability.  Again we failed our promise.

       We said we  could produce efficient, environmentally benign electric
       vehicles.  Where are they?  We still  don't  have a good, affordable
       electric vehicle battery and not much on the horizon  even  though a
       number of you are working hard in that area.  We have fortunately

                                      Page 4





       begun to reassemble  teams for their development, but cycle life and
       energy density still remain the challenge.   Perhaps  variations  on
       the nickel-hydrogen battery which is now flying reliably in space
       systems can offer  some reason for optimism.  No matter  that  ideas
       like this were being worked 15 years ago.

       We talked of  modular fuel cells for utility application, converting
       natural and/or coal derived gas efficiently  and  cleanly for making
       electricity.  Did we  deliver?   Are  they  commercially  available?
       Almost? What of  nuclear  power?   Fusion  reactors  may well be the
       ultimate solution to all the world's needs.  Are we closer or are we
       farther away?

       This summer engineering   work    began    on    the   International
       Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) Program,  an international
       effort to achieve  the long sought "break-even and ignition points."
       An exciting undertaking, but as Paul-Henri  Rebut, the ITER Director
       said, "If ITER fails, fusion will be delayed a half-century or more.

       "And what about hydrogen?   It was promised as the  energy  fuel  of
       the future... clean,  abundant,  non-polluting... to fuel our homes,
       factories, cars and airplanes.  We seem to have lost interest.

       These are a few of the things we promised  over  a decade and a half
       ago.  Like vote  hungry politicians, we promised easy  solutions  to
       hard, hard problems,  and, perhaps like some of those candidates, we
       didn't deliver! Not our fault you say?  "The marketplace didn't want
       these solutions" or  "The price  of  oil  dropped  and  remains  too
       cheap," you say,  or  maybe  it's  because  "our national  political
       leadership abandoned the  quest."  Then whose fault is it... Mr. and
       Mrs. American Citizen's?  No!  It  is  not  their doing, it is ours!
       You, and yes me, the technical community dropped the  ball.  We gave
       up!  We lacked  the  will  to  lead  and  fight  for the longer term
       benefit when the tide turned, and  we  went  off in other directions
       like mercenary soldiers looking for the next war.

       A lot of  us  who  were in this army seeking efficiency  and  energy
       independence (perhaps the   community   that  holds  the  long  term
       viability of earth in its hands),  found  new tables to feed from...
       we changed our hats, embraced new goals and saluted new flags.  Do I
       really blame you for this?  Of course not!  I am a  realist  too, as
       well as a  sometimes hopeless romantic and optimistic futurist.  The
       need to support graduate students,  keep a healthy bottom line, keep
       the tyranny of Wall Street at bay, and pay the bills  made us, maybe
       reluctantly, into a different kind of warrior.

       How many kinds  of  warriors  have  you  been or will you be in your
       career?  How many times have we  turned  our  backs  on  our  former
       passions to seek new relationships with some new and glitzy newcomer
       whose allure is measured by the size of its purse? But has this been
       necessary?  Are you  and  I  obligated  to  forgo  our  beliefs  and
       commitments?  Are we forever going to abrogate our promises?  Are we
       forever going to let our dreams die, our technical expertise wither,
       our passions cool?

       That, my colleagues,  is  the  crux of the real question you need to
       address.  Let me rephrase it very  simply.   Do  we believe and care
       enough to do what is right... what is right for our  nations... what
       is right for  our  world?   I  think you and I have an obligation we
       have not delivered on.
                                      Page 5





       We have an  obligation  to  our  nations and to the world to provide
       leadership.  We have an obligation  to  make  the  hard  choices and
       propose and demand,  yes  demand  solutions,  even   difficult   and
       unpopular ones.

       In many ways  we  are  at  the junction in the path that Frost talks
       about in another of his poems, The  Road  Not  Taken.   In that poem
       Frost talks of two paths in a woods and says, "I took  the  one less
       traveled by, and  that  has  made  all the difference."  To draw the
       analogy, think of the path we have  been traveling.  A journey begun
       with a rousing  sendoff  at  the start.  A sendoff characterized  by
       national pronouncements, brass bands, press conferences, lofty goals
       and national commitments, and yes, even resources!

       But after we  had  trod  down  the  path for a kilometer or two, the
       voices of the critics and the naysayers  begin  to  whisper from the
       dark woods through which we travel.  Soon the whispers  grow  to  an
       ebullient chorus, singing the critical song of discontent in an ever
       rising crescendo.  You  have heard their voices and the ever ringing
       echoes, the verses of their songs  becoming  more and more petulant,
       more caustic, more  negative.  These songs soon are  joined  by  the
       brass instruments of  those  with  other  agendas...  those  who see
       profit in stopping your journey so they can plunder your carriage.

       Soon we once again are debating the wisdom of the journey we are on.
       "Why," the chorus and band assembled  shout, "are we doing this when
       we have so many other urgent needs?  Why are we doing  this  when it
       is the responsibility  of  others?    Why  are  we doing this when I
       could be using  your  carriage   for   MY   special  journey  to  MY
       destination... one, they  assert  loudly,  that offers  far  greater
       reward than yours?"  And so we debate again, endlessly it seems.

       What is so  interesting  is  that  when we ask the same questions we
       asked previously, we now get strikingly  different  answers  to  the
       same questions.  Now we have plenty of oil... now we  have plenty of
       natural gas... now  we  have  plenty  of  everything!  No need to do
       anything.  Let's move on to other  more  pressing  priorities! So it
       goes, we start, we travel a little way, and then we  quit.   That is
       the path we  are  on  my colleagues, and this is a path that is well
       trodden by others before us... their  tracks  visible in the clay of
       history.

       Unlike Frost, we  are taking the path trodden by others...   a  path
       well worn, littered  with discarded commitments, broken promises and
       decaying ideals.  Frost  takes the  path  less  traveled.   That,  I
       suggest to you, is what we should do as well.  Maybe we need to take
       the path that is rocky and steep and not well lighted,  and  stay on
       our path no  matter  how loud the whispers from the woods become, no
       matter how bitter the environment,  and  no  matter that the journey
       may be longer and harsher than we first thought and  no  matter that
       hidden behind the  rocks  are  those who would ravage us and plunder
       our purses to fatten theirs.

       Think of the journeys we have begun  in  the  recent  years.  I have
       already mentioned the  "War for Energy Independence."   Two  decades
       ago we went to the moon, not once but several times.  Why did we go?
       Well, John Kennedy  said it so well:  "We go not because it is easy,
       we go because it is hard."  The keys were leadership and commitment.


                                      Page 6





       We had them  then...  we  set tough goals, we met the challenges, we
       overcame the setbacks.  We went to  the moon and then [pause]... and
       then we quit.  That is something people hundreds of  years  from now
       will never understand.   We  have  now lost that capability.  We now
       are farther away from being able to  go  to the moon than we were 25
       years ago!

       Remember the Solar  Power Satellite concept?  With  its  huge  solar
       collectors orbiting the  earth,  beaming  power  down  to  an energy
       hungry world... a  bold concept,  utilizing  space  for  terrestrial
       needs.  Relegated to our bookshelves or file cabinets now.  Why?

       Was it too grand, too visionary, too hard?  [A footnote: I have just
       returned from Japan at the International Space University  where 100
       of the world's   brightest   young  professionals  from  across  the
       technical, business and social disciplines  in 29 countries are busy
       with a comprehensive   design  project  on  all  aspects   of   this
       concept...  There is  hope!   These ideas will be kept alive in many
       countries.

       Remember our attempt to build an  American  supersonic  transport...
       again we quit...  it got too hard... the road was  too  long...  the
       path too dark  to  see  clearly.   All  these  years  later,  we are
       starting over with a new supersonic program, the High Speed Research
       Program.  So many years lost!  Where  might we be now if we had seen
       it through?  And what about hypersonic flight, broadly  supported or
       faltering??

       Look back to  this  summer.   The  superconducting supercollider, an
       investment to penetrate the most fundamental  properties  of matter,
       is near termination.  Another big start...  another  abandonment  or
       pulled from the fire?  How many of you know that NASA actually built
       and flight tested nuclear space power systems in the late 1960's.

       But we stopped,  we  quit,  we  gave up.  Now, more than two decades
       later, we have  to start over.   Will  that  be  sustained?  Do  you
       remember our commitment  to  eradicate  poverty  in  America?   That
       journey has been  halted and in fact the travelers on that path have
       retreated... as the  echoes  were   too   loud  and  the  challenges
       allegedly too great.

       What about our goals of civil rights and true equality?  The wardens
       of distrust and bigotry seem to have halted that journey.  How about
       the International Space Station Freedom?  Boldly, we  invest  in the
       future to take  a  permanent  habitat  into  space  using  the first
       electric utility in  orbit.   True   to   our   recent  history,  we
       repeatedly downsize and re-scope the effort, pairing  the capability
       down to the  bone  (at  an even greater total cost by the way).  And
       now we talk of quitting and push  it  almost  to the brink.  Not, my
       colleagues and fellow citizens, atypical in our world today!

       We are now  embarked  on  other national crusades.   In  the  United
       States, education, as  it should be, is in vogue right now.  We have
       an Education President and Education  Governors and Education Mayors
       and others.  We all know how vitally important an educated citizenry
       is to our  society.   We  are, we are told, going  to  be  first  in
       science and mathematics, assure that better than 95% of our children
       graduate from high   school,   and   assure   functional  levels  of
       competence in the basic skills.

       Remember the Williamsburg   Education  Summit  with  its  big  press
       conferences and media events, the  pronouncements, the speeches, the
       trumpets blasting that  Wagnerian-like  overture  entitled   a  "New
       National Commitment."  Will we see this commitment through either?

       Schools in both  rural and urban America are laying off teachers and
       staff, cutting programs as budgets  are cut and tax levies fail.  We
       even hear calls  to  challenge  the public school system,  once  the
       bedrock of the  American  culture,  in favor of a network of private
       schools.  History will cast its harsh light on that question and its
       answer will be part of our legacy  to  those  who  will  inherit our
       world.

       American business has often been criticized for being short sighted,
       for only looking  at  this quarter's "bottom line."   We  have  seen
       advanced technology, often  paid  for  by  tax dollars, abandoned to
       foreign competition by our business  leaders  because the time frame
       was viewed as  too  long.   I  am personally familiar  with  several
       examples... one, developed  to  the  state  of  potential commercial
       application by the government, was  pursued  by  an American company
       but then dropped when the buyout barons arrived on  the  scene.  The
       Japanese are now pursuing its commercialization feasibility.

       Coal-based Integrated Gasification   Combined   Cycle   (IGCC)   was
       developed and first demonstrated in this country in the mid-1980's..
       but the first  commercial  prototype   will   be  installed  in  the
       Netherlands next year.  These are not uncommon stories  and you each
       can add your own vignettes I am sure.  The wisdom of establishing an
       American Industrial Policy (the politically correct term) is evoking
       intense debate and  whatever  evolves  may  be  a  factor in the way
       American business operates in the future.

       It was once believed that government  had that special obligation to
       invest in our  longer term needs... it was acknowledged  that  major
       national commitments were   often  decades  in  duration.   We  once
       accepted and practiced that belief...  but  now  the  pressures  are
       intense for government to focus more and more on current  needs  and
       to sacrifice the strategic investments in our future.

       Like Mr. and  Mrs.  American  citizen,  our national bank account is
       being overdrawn so  we  can  consume  now  rather  than  invest  for
       tomorrow... and the bill is being sent to our children.  "Please pay
       promptly," it will say, "or your privileges will be  suspended."   A
       question that begs  to  be  asked:  To  whom  will they make out the
       check?  I don't know if you enjoy  and  read  history like I do, but
       any examination of  past  civilizations,  in particular  those  that
       flourished and prospered,   shows   they   practiced   boldness  and
       commitment.  But history also shows  that  when  doubts creep in and
       the whisperers begin  to  have  the  ear  of the leaders,  when  the
       naysayers' and the  exploiters' voices are so loud that their shrill
       drowns out the reason and rhetoric  of  the committed, decline finds
       its point of  entry  and  begins  to fester in the  timbers  of  the
       society... that the  pervasive  fog  of  negativism blocks the light
       from reaching into the debate, and  as  soon  as the last flicker is
       extinguished, the cold night swallows them forever.

       Perhaps I am getting too philosophical here for the  keynote address
       to a technical  conference...  but I hope you bear with me and don't
       take my admonitions for other than what they are intended to be...

                                      Page 8





       an alert, if  you  will.  A clang or maybe in the words of a popular
       TV commercial, "a Cha-Ching," a loud noise designed to get your
       attention... not to sell you hamburgers, but to sell you a notion. A
       notion that we must take a far different  path  then the one we have
       been following.

       We must because, my colleagues, the path we are on is not getting us
       to grandmother's house, it is the road to the wolf's  lair!   It may
       be very appropriate  to give time to these issues right now as we in
       the U.S. are  embarking  on  our quadrennial  presidential  campaign
       season.  The issues of leadership and national commitment  ought  to
       be on the  menu of discussion and debate.  And if the candidates are
       timid in discussing these issues,  we  should demand their views and
       demand they share their solutions to our crisis of commitment.

       We should ask  why we are afraid to be bold, why we  are  afraid  to
       make hard choices,  why  we are afraid to lead, why do we succumb to
       the forces of negativism and doubt? We have seen changes of profound
       and yes, epoch defining proportions in the world in recent years.
       Changes that the pen of history with  its indelible ink, will record
       and put into context.

       But we react  strangely  to  this new world.  We are  simultaneously
       optimistic and pessimistic.   We  rejoice  in our successes and then
       demean our motives.  We praise our  technology  but  then damn it in
       the next breath.  We clamor for more but deny our responsibility  to
       pay and persevere  through  the difficult times.  We stress the here
       and now, and  ignore the hereafter.   We  ask  for  faster,  better,
       cheaper but will not quench our appetite for big and expensive.

       In my mind  there  is  no  question  about  our  abilities  to  find
       solutions... no questions  of  our  technological  acumen...  and no
       question about our needs.  The only  question  is:   Are we going to
       take the path less traveled?  For my colleagues that will  "make all
       the difference!"

       In this brave new world we face, we must find new ways  of doing our
       business.  We are   going  to  be  faced  with  increasingly  scarce
       resources in a time of increasingly severe problems, not only in the
       energy arena, but in many aspects  of  our  lives.   To enable us to
       continue viable and productive research and technology  programs, in
       order to avoid  quitting  yet again in mid-journey, we the technical
       community must find new economies,  new  approaches  and new ways of
       "getting on with it."

       In NASA the words are "Faster, Better, Cheaper, Without Compromising
       Safety." I think  those words may be applicable here  as  well.   We
       must collaborate more,  share  our  ideas,  share our facilities and
       yes, even our people.  To quote Edzard Reuter, Chairman of the Board
       of Management at Daimler-Benz, talking about future technologies, he
       says, "The technologies vital to  our  future  can be researched and
       developed only through   global   cooperation,   which   calls   for
       pioneering strategic business    alliances    unhindered   by   bloc
       mentalities... and it will be not  so  much  policy, as technologies
       and markets that  will  cross  borders and promote  integration  the
       world over."

       That broad based  technology  has  been  and will continue to be the
       engine of economic growth and the catalyst for human progress is, I

                                      Page 9





       think, acknowledged by  most  of us.  However, as the mathematicians
       say, "That is a necessary but not sufficient condition."  By itself,
       technology will not assure success.   That team of horses that pulls
       Robert Frost's sleigh along the path less taken, must  pull together
       for the common   good  on  the  journey.   Like  a  solitary  horse,
       technology cannot pull the sleigh  alone.   It  must work in harmony
       with others on  the  team...  others  with  names  like  leadership,
       government-private sector partnerships, national will, environmental
       commitment, international cooperation,  and  social justice, to pull
       us up the steeper hills.

       As we follow the path, we will be  guided  by  a  combination of our
       intellect, our training,  our  experience,  our instincts,  and  the
       driver's gentle tugs.   Please let us work together as colleagues to
       set the direction and keep our journeys,  once  undertaken,  on  the
       path of progress, moving forward, regardless of the steepness of the
       path or the  whispers  from  the trees.  The generations  that  will
       follow us depend,   critically  on  you  and  me.   We  must  engage
       ourselves and look beyond our perceived  limits  of influence.  That
       is the legacy we should leave... that is the duty we have.

       I trust that the conference will provide you all the  opportunity to
       discuss and share,  challenge  and  debate,  define the problems and
       suggest the solutions.  Our obligations  as  technical  leaders  and
       innovators are real and of more importance now than ever.

       Thank you for  the opportunity to speak this morning  and  for  your
       willingness to listen to me struggle with reality as a humanist, and
       yes, still an  optimist.  In closing, ponder the challenge, symbolic
       of [Slide]: America at the Threshold  and  the  poet's closing line:
       "But I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep..."

                                   URGENT APPEAL

              APPEAL TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR HELP WITH GOVERNMENT
                                        AND
            BIG BUSINESS SUPPRESSION OF NEW EMERGING ENERGY TECHNOLOGY

       Dear Fellow American,

       Let first introduce  myself.   I  am  an  independent  inventor  and
       engineer working in  the  field  of advanced energy systems.  I have
       been very successful in creating  the  advanced  energy systems that
       all of us will need if we are to survive and prosper  in  the coming
       years.  These energy   systems  use  the  forces  of  the  electric,
       magnetic, and gravitational  nuclear,  etc.   Some  of  my  work  is
       contained in US Patent No. 4,897,592:  Electrostatic Energy Power
       Generating Systems.

       The United States   Department   of   Energy   and   various   large
       corporations have and are attempting to suppress this new emerging
       energy technology.  They  use  vicious  harassment,  death  threats,
       blackmail, extortion and employ people to file frivolous lawsuits to
       drain off resources to stop development  and  manufacture.   I  have
       been in court for five years over every conceivable frivolous matter
       one could think of.

       Unless I receive help from the American people, I will not be able

                                      Page 10





       to work in  this  important  energy technology area, as the costs of
       fighting a cabinet  level federal  bureaucracy  and  billion  dollar
       corporations is prohibitive.   My  legal costs over  the  last  five
       years has been  over  $35,000.   I have lost over 30 foreign patents
       because of the government action.   The  politicians  wonder  why we
       have no economy, no jobs.

       Please help one  of America's most talented creative  inventors  by:
       calling or writing President Bush and your congressman to stop this
       outrageous attempt to maintain the "status quo" greedy monopolies
       that rip you off day after day.

       Please send me a short note of your contribution towards this effort
       with your name  and  address and I will place you on a mailing list.
       People on this  list  will  first   be  offered  the  stock  of  the
       corporation formed to   manufacture   this   now   emerging   energy
       technology plus will receive technical updates.

       Again, I ask for your help in this important matter.  I personally
       thank all of  you  in  advance  for  your  help.   I look forward to
       hearing from you all.

       Sincerely,

       (signed)

       WRITE HIM!  I suggest you enclose $1 to defray his mailing costs.

                    On Solving the Great Problems of the World

                 Selected Excerpts Made by Videotape Transcription

       I have been observing many meetings  on  'Solving the Great Problems
       of the World' for many years now.

       One of the things we are constantly looking for in our meetings, and
       have been for  many  decades,  is  an elusive thing  called  'Energy
       policy.'  This is like looking for the 'Holy Grail.'  ... Since the
       early 1970's, there has been much searching for this Holy Grail.

                             - * - * - * - * - * - * -
              (regarding public, political, and governmental policy)

       Now the problem with all of this, and it is not only our problem, it
       is a problem that I see throughout the world, is that we do not hold
       cohesively against certain  national  problems.  Or, it takes a very
       long time to get together a consensus to make a decision.

       In energy, we have made decisions in the United States that have
       led us in one direction.  ... They hold decisions in 'Public Policy'
       as separate from 'National Policy.'

       Now, sometimes a government can act  decisively.   This  is  a great
       quality, and sometimes it is a great error:  sometimes it goes the
       Wrong Way!

       Now in science  and  technology, (I think that we  say)  that  in  a
       rather Ecumenical way,  that all science and all engineering and all
       discovery is good, and it should  be  financed.   And  then we break
       apart into our  separate disciplines, and we believe  that  what  we
       (individually) are doing  is  good  and  it should be financed;  and
       that it might be the entrepreneur solution to all our problems.

       The problem of the commitment with scientists and engineers, is that
       it tends to be looked at in a one  factor  analysis and extrapolated
       out into the future.
                             - * - * - * - * - * - * -
                (in relating a story told by a senior member on the
                 Science and Technology Appropriations Committee)

       "I don't know what to do about these scientist fellows.   They  come
       in here and  want a million dollars from my Appropriations Committee
       to discover something.  And, well  you give the million dollars, and
       they probably discover  something, and then they're  back  the  next
       year - and  they want three million to find out what it is that they
       discovered."

       This is another problem in science,  and  that  is  that  we tend to
       spend all of  our  efforts  to  replicate something  that  we  have,
       instead of taking that 'Quantum Leap Forward' to the next thing!  It
       is understandable in this situation that that is quite comparable to
       building a wind  machine  to  make  the  sail  ship  more efficient.
       Instead of taking the power and driving the propeller.  We do it all
       the time!

       When Howard Hughes built the 'Spruce  Goose',  he had a problem:  he
       didn't have enough  power  for  it.   He  had  eight   reciprocating
       engines.  He needed  a  'Giant  Step  Forward.'  He understood this.
       There was no point in adding more engines and propellers.  He needed
       the Jet Engine!

       Sometimes I think that we are trying  to replicate something that we
       have had, instead of taking a 'Quantum Leap Forward.'   And,  it  is
       not always clear what that 'Forward Step' is.

                             - * - * - * - * - * - * -
            (while relating a story regarding a slow train trip during
             after his first seeing a demonstration of fiber optics:)


                                      Page 12





       ... And I was just stunned.  It was amazing, this technology.

       And I began thinking about electricity, about energy in general, and
       where is the  'Quantum  Leap  Forward?'   Where  is  the jump from a
       copper wire to a fiber or to cable?   Where  was the 'Leap Forward!'
       Where was the 'Equivalent' of fiber optics (for electricity)?

       Whatever we have done to improve the production of  electricity,  we
       have done one tremendous thing:  and that is nuclear.  We are still
       boiling water!  And  we  are  still using 19th century plumbing.  We
       are still using  21st century technology  on  top  of  19th  century
       plumbing!

       We have failed  with  energy  to  come  up  with   the   'Great  Big
       Breakthrough!'  'The Major   Change.'    'The   Radically  Different
       Thing.'

       The new technologies  (discussed   at   this  conference),  such  as
       magnetohydrodynamics, (are coming  forth)...  and yet  these  things
       have not fostered (results) - and we are still left boiling water!

       It is theoretically  possible  that we could at some point take this
       'Quantum Leap.'  However, (from  where  I  sit  and  what I see) the
       evidence is not promising.  There us nothing in sight that looks as
       though it can substitute for the way we do it now.

                             - * - * - * - * - * - * -
               (about the US love affair with and inside of gasoline
         automobiles, and about how to advance any forthcoming technology)

       We are not going to do it until we deploy some new cars, get running
       experience, and incremental improvements.  You cannot get from Kitty
       Hawk to the Concord without building some airplanes  along  the way,
       and yes, crashing  them  to  boot.  You could not have designed from
       Kitty Hawk to the 747 on a computer!!!

       We are restricted, in these days upon  this  world, in deploying new
       technologies and think projects.  Because we have developed a dismal
       habit of trying to predict the future - and the risks of the future.
       We are no good at it, and we know that.  There is no  projection  of
       the future that works!

       However, we live  in  very strange times.  And again I find there is
       an international commonality, that is not particularly American, but
       that is that our 'Public Policy' is driven by 'Hypothetical Horrors'
       that we are known (to be fostering). ...

       'Hypothetical Horrors' abound:  they  are  on  our front pages every
       day!  ...  We are driven by these events, not by what  is  here now,
       not by what  is  real,  but  by  what  might be!  And it is having a
       deleterious impact on the development  of large projects and changes
       in the way we have done things.

       As so often, the United States becomes the first  in  this  sort  of
       grid-lock fear of  the  future.  And that is not confined to us.  It
       is a world-wide phenomena.

       Things are changing very quickly.   And  it  seems  to  me, that the
       great success of Japan to which they should be promoted and

                                      Page 13





       welcomed, and admired,  and  the  last  above all these, is that the
       Japanese have collectively taken on the 'Adventure of Science!'

       That they have a sense of adventure about science, about commerce,
       and about engineering - that the  British  had  in the 18th and 19th
       centuries, and that we had in the latter part of the one and in the
       early part of this century;  and we know that!

       We have become  rather slow in society, where everybody  is  looking
       for some sort of mystical plateau, on which they can serve out their
       time on Earth.    Corporations   are   looking   for  this  plateau,
       individuals are looking for it, and therefore anything that suggests
       change, competition, or different  ways  of  doing  things,  is very
       difficult to deal with.

       One of the Great Problems that you have as engineers and scientists,
       and there may  be  people  in this very room who can  make  enormous
       contributions to the  energy equation, is the slowness, that we have
       of adopting new technology:  'Technology Transfer.'

       Most of the technologies that we now  speak  about on the Globe have
       been around for a good while, and were not developed  in  the manner
       in which they  were  invented.   Whether  it  was  the jet engine in
       Britain or Ampex (magnetic) tape  in  the  United  States:   We  are
       reluctant to transfer   technology!   Because  of   disturbing   the
       'Political Tide!'

       We have not  solved  the technology transfer problem whatsoever.  We
       have set up various crucibles of experimentation,  bases,  privately
       funded like the Electric Power Research Institute,  publicly  funded
       like the national  laboratories  in  this  country,  or  Harwell  in
       Britain, and on and on and on, but the rate of transfer has is very
       very poor and very slow.

       More productive societies are still looking for their plateau.  They
       have not reached that point of self-satisfaction  that is causing us
       such difficulty as we move ahead.

       In energy, we  have  adopted  in  this  country  one   of  the  most
       destructive public policy  options  that  you  could  have:  We have
       declared that gasoline  could  be   the   next   cheapest  substance
       available in large  quantities than water.  It's much  cheaper  than
       Coca Cola, it  is  much  cheaper  than  Gatorade  water,  it is much
       cheaper than all the other silly  things  -  and  in  that,  we  are
       serving a staple to our consumers that is much larger  than  all  of
       our rhetoric.  And  we  are  prepared, apparently, to fight wars, in
       order to maintain this.

       Therefore, there is very little hope  for  some (new) form of energy
       policy, while the  people  are  prepared  to pay for  their  largest
       extravagance in energy,  which  is gasoline.  It is not electricity;
       it is not crude oil;  it is gasoline  -  petrol.   We  are sending a
       signal that this is the way to go!!!

       If any of you have gone to purchase a new automobile these days, you
       will find the salesman as often as not will forget  to  tell  you in
       the United States,  the  gas  mileage.   I  doubt  that  in Italy he
       doesn't forget to tell you the gas mileage!


                                      Page 14





       That has become  our 'policy.'  Therefore, we cannot look to 'energy
       policy' for 'energy policy guidance.'   The  'policy'  being one of:
       'Let It Stay As It Is!'

       But we can look to 'environmental policy,' which is  more  active in
       the United States than in any other nation.

                             - * - * - * - * - * - * -
                       (on the US electric utility industry)

       And it is  my  belief  that a gas turbine is to energy policy that a
       hotel is to   homelessness:   a   very   expensive   and   temporary
       alternative.

                             - * - * - * - * - * - * -
                          (back to the US energy policy)

       And this mess  is going to go on until a point in  time.   And  then
       something is going   to   happen  that  is  going  to  change  it  -
       permanently, and differently.

       And, this involves a theory that I  have.   And that is that we like
       to say that:   "You  can't  just  have simple solutions  to  complex
       problems.  You must  have complex solutions to complex problems." So
       you get:  'Very Complex Solutions' to 'Very Complex Problems.' Until
       the point is reached where the weight  of  this thing causes its own
       collapse - and a 'Big Bold Simple Solution' to the 'complex problem'
       is required.  And when that emergency is perceived, 'Big Bold Simple
       Solutions' are introduced, and they Do Work!  They can be swept thru
       Parliaments, swept thru Congress, or implemented by  Fear,  as often
       happens.  And at  some point, as we roll toward the next century, it
       is my belief that we will again visit (vastly increased) oil prices,
       oil shorts (shortages), and environmental  impact  problems.  Do not
       forget that the  Green Movement may be driving the (energy)  policy,
       and the environmental impact is quite substantial in that it extends
       from the extraction,   to  the  transportation,  to  the  combustion
       (empires).  At which time we will  look  at  some of the things that
       are (waiting) in the wings, and some of the things  that  may  be in
       the wings!

       And if you  would  go out and invent a new electric generator today,
       the 'Black Box,' the equivalent of  the fiber optic cable, you would
       find that the   most  severe  opponent  would  not   be   from   the
       environmental movement, but  it  would be the extant of the industry
       (to not be destroyed or lost), because that is how we operate!!!

       And likewise, if we would come up  with  an electric vehicle that is
       of the form,  or  equal  to, or was in close relationship  with  the
       internal combustion engine, your opponents would be worldwide:  the
       automobile manufactures would   not  be  ready  to  adopt  this  new
       technology.

                             - * - * - * - * - * - * -
             (on the development and introduction of new technologies)

       And in order  to  do  that,  I  believe   that  you  will  need  new
       institutions to deploy new technology. That they won't be deployed
       by the extant of the old institutions.


                                      Page 15





       The Challenge in  Technology  is  to  find it, and then sell it, and
       finally to employ  it.   After   R&D   is   another   D,   which  is
       'Deployment.'  The technology  that is developed and  put  onto  the
       self is sueable.

       In the situation  that  we  are  in,  in  the  nation,  it  takes  a
       Professional Society to  be  their   own   advocates  in  their  own
       technology.  The corporations are not credible, and even governments
       are not credible.  An individual and individual societies are.

       You are in  a very exciting situation, because as  being  scientists
       and being engineers, you have inherited the mantle of the poets: You
       can dream the  dreams  that  only  once  poets  could dream.  We too
       become obsolete.

       Thank you very much.

                      INSIGHTS INTO THE PROPRIETARY SYNDROME

                                  By KEN MacNEILL

                                 Cadake Industries
                               Winter Haven, Florida

       PART I

       To give you some background on myself, I have been interested in the
       energy situation since I can remember.   I  have  built all kinds of
       devices, solar energy   panels,   windmills,  photovoltaic   arrays,
       flywheel devices, and  also  carburetors  of  which  I  will talk on
       Sunday.  In my background I am an  accomplished  tool  and diemaker,
       moldmaker, been involved  in  Design  Engineering for  the  past  12
       years, primarily in the automation area.

       My first real involvement with other people in this alternate energy
       area was at  the  Toronto  Symposium  in  1981  where  I  met George
       Hathaway as well  as  over 100 other  people  that  believe  in  the
       impossible according to orthodox science.  Since  that  time  I have
       made myself aware of just about everything that is happening in this
       field, and believe  me  there are some really fantastic things going
       on.  The rediscovery of some of the  technology that was lost in the
       past is finally  coming  to  realization,  for  instance  the  Tesla
       technology, the Hubbard  device,  the Moray approach to tapping into
       the free energy supply that we're  sitting  in  without even knowing
       it.

       A friend of  mine  gave  me  a  real insight possibly  without  even
       knowing it.  He  said  the  problem  could  only  be  solved by just
       considering the problem of weighing  a  glass  of  water at 500 feet
       under water.  Here you are under water with a glass of water:  how
       do you weigh it???

       The analogy is the same for us.  Here we sit in the  vastness of the
       cosmos on top  of  one of the biggest magnets known to us and we are
       like the glass of water.  We are in the vast ocean of energy.  Look
       around us and  watch  just  the  weather   for  instance,  the  next
       thunderstorm, think of all the electrical potential being wasted.
       That energy is there;  it is very real.

                                      Page 16





       Tom Bearden, one of our upcoming speakers, may have illustrated it
       quite well by the bird sitting on top of the wire with 13,000 volts
       going through it.   We  all  know  that  it  could  kill  him but it
       doesn't.  I am positive that within this group will be the ways and
       means for making the energy situation of the future change.

       Now to the other side of this coin.   Why  has  not  this technology
       been allowed to become established?  We have to look  at the 'profit
       motive' involved.  If  we have free energy, how will they charge for
       it?  What will happen to the billions  of dollars that the utilities
       and oil companies and the government backing these establishments do
       if we can give the people independence from the chains  of having to
       pay for energy?

       One question that  has  been  uppermost in my mind for the last year
       has been the rhetoric given by our elected representatives about the
       energy situation and the amount of  money given to small researchers
       who could possibly  give  us  a viable approach to  becoming  energy
       independent.  Who gets  the  government money??  Let me get a little
       audience participation in the question.   How  many  of you have all
       the money you  need for research in the energy area?   Everyone  who
       has please stand!!!!!   Now let me mention a few of the names of the
       companies that get the money.  See  if  you  recognize them:  Exxon,
       Gulf Oil, General   Electric,  Westinghouse,  TRW,   Exide   Storage
       Battery, all manufacturers or producers of fossil fuel products.

       We need to  get  away  from  the fossil fuels for the future and get
       into something that can indeed give  us  a  future  because  we  are
       rapidly depleting not only our natural resources  but  our  air  and
       water.  All because   of   burning   fossil   fuels.   We  fund  our
       universities and colleges in the most directed of ways.  If you want
       to explore the possibilities in some of the more esoteric areas, for
       instance the ones you will be hearing  about in the next three days,
       there is no money for that.  WHY???  Because of the possibility that
       we might succeed.  What would our government do if  all the American
       people could go  back and forth to work, heat their homes, run their
       businesses without paying taxes on gas and oil?

       Consider the fact that all of the  gas  stations  would  go  out  of
       business or would have to find other ways of making money.  Many
       complimentary businesses would  also  fold.   But   alas,   this  is
       America.  What are  we  here for???  To perpetuate Big Business, Big
       Government, or to advance toward  the  future,  not expending all of
       our natural resources  but  to save them to make the  goods  of  the
       future.  Coal and  oil  both  can  be  used  for making all kinds of
       things besides fuels;  the list is endless.

       It is my feeling that the technology  may  be  already  here and may
       have been shown to the government.  It even may have been introduced
       to our patent office and turned down.  Because as you know, there is
       no such thing as a perpetual motion device.  And  I  agree  with the
       premise because forever is a long time.

       But there are  surely some of the devices or parts thereof that have
       been introduced to the government  or  to  big  business in the past
       which have been shelved.  Tesla's transmission device  is  a classic
       illustration probably best  known  to  this group.  What happened is
       that they removed the money from him to do his research and


                                      Page 17





       effectively stifled this  remarkable  man.  How many other times has
       it happened to someone not so well known?

       At this moment, there are over 3,000  devices or applications in the
       patent office that have been branded as security or  put under wraps
       by the secrecy order, Title 35, U.S. Code (1952) Sections 181-188.

       What is security?   How is it defined?  I have had many inventors or
       other scientists tell me that they  did  not  want  to discuss their
       invention with me or others because they might lose  it  to us or we
       might tell someone else before they got it onto the market.  Believe
       me, it won't  get  there by going through the patent process.  It is
       my feeling that if such a device were introduced at this level, then
       it would be put under the Secrecy  Act.   I  don't  know  that  I am
       correct in this assumption.  But I cannot imagine a  government like
       ours wanting to  commit  financial suicide.  So what better way than
       to brand something as a secret?

       I would like to read the Secrecy Order to you so that you may better
       understand my concern.  Please pay  close  attention.  I think it is
       very important.  To you or anyone!!!  Consider your receiving this:

       SECRECY ORDER
       (Title 35, United States Code (1952), sections 181-188)

       NOTICE:  To the applicant above named, his heirs, and any and all of
                his assignees, attorneys and agents, hereinafter designated
                principals:

       You are hereby  notified that your application as  above  identified
       has been found   to   contain   subject   matter,  the  unauthorized
       disclosure of which might be detrimental  to  the national security,
       and you are ordered in nowise to publish or disclose  the  invention
       or any material information with respect thereto, including hitherto
       unpublished details of  the  subject  matter of said application, in
       any way to any person not cognizant  of  the  invention prior to the
       date of the order, including any employee of the principals,  but to
       keep the same secret except by written consent first obtained of the
       Commissioner of Patents,  under  the  penalties  of 35 U.S.C. (1952)
       182, 186.

       Any other application  already  filed   or   hereafter  filed  which
       contains any significant  part of the subject matter  of  the  above
       identified application falls  within  the  scope  of this order.  If
       such other application does not stand under a security order, it and
       the common subject matter should be  brought to the attention of the
       Security Group, Licensing and Review, Patent Office.

       If, prior to the issuance of the secrecy order, any significant part
       of the subject  matter  has  been  revealed  to  any   person,   the
       principals shall promptly  inform  such  person of the secrecy order
       and the penalties for improper disclosure.  However, if such part of
       the subject matter was disclosed to  any person in a foreign country
       or foreign national  in  the U.S., the principals shall  not  inform
       such person of the secrecy order, but instead shall promptly furnish
       to the Commissioner  of  Patents  the  following  information to the
       extent not already furnished:  date of disclosure;  name and address
       of the disclosee;    identification   of   such   part;    and   any
       authorization by a U.S. government agency to export such part.  If

                                      Page 18





       the subject matter is included in any foreign patent application, or
       patent, this should be identified.  The principals shall comply with
       any related instructions of the Commissioner.

       This order should  not  be  construed  in  any  way to mean that the
       Government has adopted  or  contemplates  adoption  of  the  alleged
       invention disclosed in this application;  nor is it any indication
       of the value of such invention.
                             - * - * - * - * - * - * -
       It is my  feeling that something on the order of a  so-called  'free
       energy device' would receive this treatment.  My only approach would
       be to go  to the public domain.  That is, get the information or the
       device out there to enough people  that  they  could  not  stop you.
       This group looks  like the best group to give this  information  to.
       Hopefully it will forthcoming in the next three days.
