                           An Encounter With Doyle Noyes
                                  By Bill Donavan

       The first time  I  had  ever  heard  about Doyle Noyes was in March,
       1991.  It was when Andrew Michrowski  of  the  Planetary Association
       for Clean Energy  visited  Stelle,  Illinois.   There  was  a  lunch
       consisting of a  vegetarian  pizza  which Ginger Tharp cooked up for
       the occasion.  It was a cozy little get-together with Andrew and his
       wife Monique Michaud,  myself,  Tim   Wilhelm,  Ginger  cooking  and
       managing the video  equipment  recording  the  meeting,  and  others
       coming and going  through  the  community  center  where  we had our
       lunch.

       The conversation was fascinating  to  say  the  least.   A line from
       "Alice in Wonderland" immediately comes to mind, about "believing in
       several impossible things  before breakfast".  An  air-well  concept
       was discussed by  which  the  community could obtain all their fresh
       water practically out of thin air.   Then the conversation turned to
       "scalar aerials".  This  was a discovery by Doyle  Noyes,  who  then
       lived in Kansas City Missouri, of obtaining free energy from certain
       antenna geometries as  well  as  heating  and  cooling and corrosion
       control.  This fascinated me.  It  piqued  my  curiosity.   I had to
       know how this worked, since according to Andrew Michrowski  and  Tom
       Bearden this phenomena   had  actually  been  documented  as  having
       produced a measurable effect.  Absolutely  fascinating.   How  do  I
       contact this guy?   Dr.  Michrowski  gave  me his  phone  number  in
       Missouri.  I found  that  Noyes  had  moved  into  a  rather  remote
       location in the Ozarks for an unknown reason.

       After talking to  Mr.  Noyes,  I discovered  that  he  was  offering
       distributorships in his  company,  Multistate Control  Systems.   At
       this point in my naivete, I believed everything was on-the-level.  I
       then contacted a  buddy of mine, Rick Bassett, about this "marvelous
       opportunity".  Basically what Noyes was asking for was $600.00 for a
       weekend-long educational seminar  detailing  the  operation  of  his
       system including the "territory" of the state of  Illinois  for  his
       scalar heating and cooling system.

       "Oh, by the  way,  send me a photograph of each of you". Noyes said.
       "Is this for identification purposes, or something?"  I said.
       "Uh, yeah." "Well, if we're leaving in a few days it might not get
       there in time.   It  seems  to be just an additional complication to
       me."

       "It is absolutely essential." "I really  don't think you're going to
       find two guys  passing themselves off as us, if that's  what  you're
       worried about".  "Just send'em, O.K.?  I'll explain later".

       This seemed strange,  and  it  in time evolved into an even stranger
       story.  I reasoned that since there was money involved, if this were
       indeed such a "golden opportunity"  there  might also conceivably be
       those who would  try to pass themselves off as the  individuals  who
       paid in the  considerable sum to get in on this thing.  So it seemed
       at the time.  Anyway, it sounded good  to both of us, and we set out
       for The Ozarks.  Mr. Noyes made it abundantly clear  that he did not
       want to meet  at  his  house,  and a meeting place was arranged at a
       local motel (another  curious  point  in  retrospect).   We  arrived
       somewhat late, and went directly to the motel room.   There were two
       other guys there,  one  from  the  Monroe Institute and another from
       Ohio.  They did not look happy.

       There were multicolored loops of  wire  strewn  all  over  the beds.
       Some appeared to be wound up into loosely-arranged  coils of various
       lengths and sizes.   There  were  two lengths of what appeared to be
       one or two-ought electrical cable  wrapped  up  in  electrical tape,
       evidently containing a coil of smaller-diameter wire wound on top of
       it and wrapped in electrical tape.  The room looked ordinary enough.

       "Whose is that?"   I asked, pointing at an old VOM  sitting  on  the
       bed.  I suspected  that one of the two in the room brought along his
       own test equipment.

       "Oh, that's his",  came the reply.  "Doyle's?"  I said. "Yeah." "But
       it's so..... old!" "Yup, that's his."

       Red flags went off.  A myriad of  conflicting  data  went through my
       mind.  Either he just left an expendable piece of equipment  behind,
       or his company was not making that much money.  It was at this point
       I knew something was wrong.

       "Have you learned  anything  yet?"   I said.  "No, not really." said
       the man from the Monroe Institute.  "How long have you been here?"
       "A couple of days".

       This did not bode well.  We talked  for  a  while  on  a few related
       topics, and compared  how  each of us became acquainted  with  Doyle
       Noyes' system.  Then  Doyle  breezed  in, introduced himself to Rick
       and I, and looked at a large wall mirror at the end of the room.  He
       inched toward it with a look of concentration on his face.

       "They're watching us".  Doyle said.  "Who's watching us?" I said.
       "The people on the other side of the mirror."

       "O.K....." Rick said.  "They can see  and hear everything we say.  I
       can see them too.  Can you see them?"

       Eyes widened as we looked at each other.  Not a word was spoken.  He
       then walked over to the mirror and extended his right hand, touching
       the surface of  the  mirror with fingers splayed as  he  closed  his
       eyes.

       "Close, close, close." Doyle said.  He then dropped his hand, looked
        at the mirror, and repeated the ritual.

       "Sometimes you have  to do it more than once.  It's closed now, they
       can't see or hear us."  Doyle announced with confidence.
       "Oh... good" said the man from Ohio.  "Excuse me, Doyle, but why did
       you need our photographs?"  I said.   "To  make  sure.   You  see, I
       dowse them to make sure you weren't Russian agents or space aliens".
       "I see.  Do you get many of those?" "You would be surprised."

       "Uh-huh."  I said  as a vision of the money which  was  paid  in  my
       mind's eye slowly  evaporated  into  the  ethers.   "Let's go out to
       eat."  Doyle said.

       The gang of four and the man himself  hiked over in the direction of
       a fast food restaurant across the street.

       "No, not there, they're expecting us there."  Doyle  said.   We then
       sauntered over to  a  restaurant  nearby to the motel.  The waitress
       seated us and passed around the menus.   "Hi,  Doyle.   How  are the
       aliens?"  She said.   "Fine."   Doyle  said, looking  up.   He  then
       pulled out a photograph and a white pendulum and started swinging it
       over the photo.  "This is how you find out if they are O.K.  You can
       find out if they're aliens or not too."

       The rest of the conversation basically consisted of the group asking
       specific questions about  the  scalar heating and cooling system and
       Doyle steering the  conversation  back  toward  aliens  and  Russian
       agents.  He also  added  to  the  menagerie  of those  organizations
       threatening to steal his secrets of the universe.  I never asked why
       he was so  willing  to  sell  those  same  secrets  if  they were so
       valuable, and so dangerous in the  wrong  hands.   I  think  at this
       point my weariness of the situation began to show,  as I listened to
       the conversation taking place with a chin resting on my palm.  Doyle
       looked at me.

       "I can read  minds too." Doyle said.  "Fine.  What am I thinking?" I
       said.  Doyle began vigorously swinging the pendulum.  "That's not my
       photograph."  I said.  He didn't say a word.

       After lunch Doyle decided it would  be  a  good  time to show us the
       campground that Rick and I would be staying at.  Doyle  rode with us
       in the pickup truck.

       "I see you  have  quite a bit of equipment."  Doyle said.  "Yeah, we
       hope to do some testing of one of your units." Rick said.

       "Well, by the time this weekend is  over,  you'll  be  able to see a
       completed unit in operation, and you'll be able to take it back with
       you.  I'll also need your help with programming them  with some kind
       of control matrix."  Doyle said.  "I noticed that you didn't drive."
       I said.

       "Well, that was because of the attack."  Doyle  said.  "What kind of
       attack?" I said.   "It was a scalar electromagnetic  beam  from  the
       Soviets.  It made  me  lose consciousness and drive off the road.  I
       was in the hospital for a while.  Anyway, my wife who was in the car
       at the time won't let me drive anymore." "O.K."

       "We need to  get  you  guys  all set up as soon as possible, since I
       expect another two to come in very  soon and I need to start another
       seminar".

       "Well, we're ready  to  do  the  assembly  and testing  as  soon  as
       possible, since we kind of have a schedule to keep too."  Rick said.
       "I want to  show  you guys the lab that I plan on setting up." Doyle
       said.

       We drove around  as  he directed  until  we  came  to  an  abandoned
       building on the top of a hill.  It was in good condition,  white  in
       color, and rather  large  in  size.   I  had  to admit it was a good
       location, being in  a  peaceful wooded  area  nestled  high  in  the
       Ozarks.  Despite Doyle's  personal  problems, I sincerely  hoped  he
       could pull it   off.   If  his  unit  indeed  worked,  it  would  be
       encouraging to see  a  production   and  R&D  facility  operational.
       Especially for something  as exotic as scalar electromagnetics.   We
       finally arrived at the campsite.

       "I got you  guys the best site here.  Nice and remote."  Doyle said.
       It certainly was an idyllic setting  next  to  a lake about 200 feet
       away.  The weather was warm enough that a campfire  would be more of
       a decoration than a necessity.

       "I want to  show  you  an  example  of weather modification."  Doyle
       said.  He then proceeded to draw what  seemed a pictorial diagram of
       one of his scalar systems.  He then held his hand over  the  drawing
       and made an obscure gesture while mumbling something.

       "It should start  cooling down in about 10 minutes."  He said with a
       grin.  Rick and I looked at each other.   "But  there is no physical
       device."  I said.  "You don't need one."  Doyle said.

       Now I know that in some cases scalar electromagnetics  tends to blur
       into psionics or  psychotronics,  but  it doesn't blur THAT much.  I
       could see a  perturbed look spread  across  Rick's  face  and  could
       safely assume what he was thinking, since I felt the same way.

       "But you tested  a device for Andrew..." I said.   "This  should  be
       just as effective.   See,  it's  starting  to  cool down already!" I
       really couldn't feel anything other  than a slight shift in the wind
       direction.  "You should watch what you say around here, by the way."
       Doyle said.  I could just see it coming.

       "There could be  either  Russian agents or the CIA  monitoring  your
       conversations.  Watch out for anybody parking a camper right next to
       your site."  Doyle said.  "What about space aliens?"  I said.  "They
       won't use campers."  Doyle said.

       We deposited Doyle  back at the motel and went back to the campsite.
       The tone of the night was somber.   Rick  built  a fire and we "shot
       the bull" about several subjects.  "I think this thing is all in his
       head."  Rick said.   "You  mean  it isn't a physical  device?   They
       tested a device  in  Ottawa, I mean a physical device.  There's test
       data." I said.  "Then maybe he's trying to sell us something else."
       "He promised us a device to bring  back."  "Unless the 'device' is a
       few magical incantations scribbled on a piece of paper."

       "Better not be.  It sounds like vaporware to me.  You can't charge
       hundreds of dollars for something like that and get away with it."
       "Unless you're too  embarrassed  to  admit  to  getting  taken in by
       something like that." "True.  Very true."

       I watched the fire dance through  the  air  and  wondered  about the
       whole situation.  If this thing were a shell game,  it  would cast a
       pall upon the  credibility  of  PACE  and  those  who gave favorable
       reviews of this thing, let alone references to this guy.

       I thought about the amount of money taken in by the "seminars".  Six
       hundred dollars per person.  Two  people  per  week.   That's twelve
       hundred dollars per  week, sixty two thousand four  hundred  dollars
       per year.  Not  bad.   I also thought about the clandestine meetings
       in motel rooms, and the insistence on not seeing where he lives.

       Doyle mentioned that he moved from  Kansas  City because of the high
       crime rate in  the  city, and I wondered if there might  be  another
       motive.  If you  were  going to run a successful scam operation, you
       wouldn't want to be very visible.   A  visible  target  is  an  easy
       target.

       I walked to  the  rocky beach and looked at the clear  diamond  sky,
       watching a thousand twinkling stars reflected in the wavelets of the
       lake.  There was  a  lodge  across  the lake which lent multicolored
       shimmering reflections to the water.   It  was absolutely wonderful,
       something I really preferred to an antiseptic motel  room.  I hadn't
       taken the opportunity  to  go  camping  for  years,  and  this was a
       welcome diversion.  I thought about  Doyle's space aliens and looked
       up at the starlit sky.

       Nothing seemed out  of  the  ordinary,  not even a plane  with  its'
       navigation strobes on.  A boat crossed the lake in the distance, and
       I thought how great it would be to live in an environment like this.
       Once again, I  hoped  that  it wasn't a scam, and that I would get a
       chance to work on something that  would  be  on  the  frontier  of a
       future science.  If nothing else, there was hope.

       The next day was more of the same.  Nothing was done except a lot of
       what I would consider evasive banter.  Nothing was built.  To soothe
       the feelings of  the four in the "seminar", Doyle  took  us  out  to
       dinner, sensing the  dissatisfaction  rising  among  us.   It  was a
       rather nice restaurant with an excellent view of the lake.  The food
       was good, and the conversation (as  always) turned to the CIA, space
       aliens, and Soviet scalar beams trained upon Doyle.

       "Yeah, I blew them up.  I back-fed enough power STRAIGHT THROUGH THE
       EARTH to take out those Soviet scalar transmitters.   And since then
       they don't bother  me.   At least until they build another one.  And
       the aliens know that I can destroy  their ships if I want to with my
       technology.  They haven't got a chance."

       "About the system  that you have, what kind of limitations  does  it
       have?"  I said.   "Anywhere from absolute zero to the temperature of
       the sun."  Doyle said.  "Then why  can't  you  heat a building using
       the scalar stuff alone?"   This went back to a report  I had read by
       Andrew Michrowski, that  basically  stated  that  it only worked for
       supplemental heating.  That  question   went   unanswered.   It  was
       ignored.  He went back to a diatribe on aliens and weather control.

       After the dinner  we  went  back  to  the motel, where Doyle told us
       about the "mind interfaces" that  we  would  need  to  work  on  the
       project.  These were the two-ought electrical cables  wrapped  up in
       electrical tape that  I  had  seen  earlier.  They were to be draped
       across the shoulders and were allegedly self-powered.

       I assumed from  the  description that  these  units  were  basically
       psychotronic amplifiers designed to "boost the signal  level" of the
       user.  I measured  a  slight increase in potential difference with a
       fluke true RMS multimeter when a girl associated with Doyle held the
       probes in each hand amounting to a  few microvolts, not quite enough
       to clear the background noise.

       Rick asked Doyle  about  the schematics for the system,  for  if  he
       didn't have something  completed  for  us, at least he could give us
       instructions for doing it when we  got back.  We went to a friend of
       his who had  a pc-compatible machine, as evidently the  "schematics"
       were on this.  I thought it was odd that Doyle didn't have a machine
       of his own  with  this  on  it,  if it indeed were as valuable as he
       claimed it to be.

       The gang of four went to his friend's place, the back of a pawn shop
       in town, and we proceeded to wade  through the files in his PC.  The
       usual discussion about  space alien effluvia bandied  about  as  the
       "schematics" were searched for.  When I saw a printout of what Doyle
       considered to be  schematics,  I  began  to  understand where he was
       coming from.  They  weren't  schematics.    They  looked  more  like
       ladder-logic diagrams.  They definitely were NOT schematics  in  any
       sense of the word.

       If Doyle had  any  formal  education,  it  definitely  was not as an
       electronic tech.  In fact, the man  had  a definite disdain for that
       particular profession.  I had the impression that he  might have had
       an intuitive "feel"  for this invention without any formal education
       associated with it.   That  is  common   for  many  inventors.   The
       explanation for this  phenomenon is that they usually  do  not  know
       what cannot be  done  and proceed to do it anyway.  And they usually
       succeed at it.  That says something there.

       That reminds me of the tale of a  religious  ecstatic  who crosses a
       gorge without a  bridge.  "You can't do that," the  physics  student
       says, "That's against  the  law  of  gravity!"   The  ecstatic  then
       replies:  "I never studied law."   And  continues  across.   I think
       that the same thing applies here, if indeed there  is  any  credible
       element to this situation at all.

       After the "seminar",  we  gave one individual in the troop a ride to
       the airport and compared notes.  The  consensus  opinion was that he
       may have had something, but if he did he refused  to  share  it.  In
       this case the  cost far outweighed the risks involved, and for those
       with limited resources  the  setback   represented   by   this   was
       considerable.  The net  tendency was for those to  become  generally
       disgusted with the  situation,  to  throw  out  the  baby  with  the
       bathwater, and to forget about it.

       Scalar electromagnetic weather control,  corrosion  control, heating
       and cooling.  Is this for real?  I really can't say,  since I didn't
       see anything demonstrated.   Rick  Bassett  and  I  came to a remote
       location in the Ozarks with a pickup truck bed literally loaded with
       electronic test equipment,  taking time out from our regular jobs to
       investigate this.  And we found nothing but wild theories, unfounded
       conjecture, and just plain hot air.

       The "schematic" which was brought  back  was well nigh useless.  The
       only thing we brought back were three four by six planks  about  ten
       feet long with about fifty pounds of wire, which by request was sent
       back to Doyle.   Evidently  he didn't have enough lumber or wire for
       the next scam operation.

       I really would like to believe that  this system works.  It would be
       a major breakthrough.  I am also aware of the scam  operations  that
       John Worrell Keely  pulled  when he was short of capital to continue
       his research, so  I  can  understand   the   reasoning  behind  this
       particular technique.

       But in the present there is no excuse for this, and I cannot in good
       conscience bury this and wish that it will go away all by itself.  I
       don't know how  many others have been victimized by  following  this
       illusion, however sweet it may be.

       But it is  time to call for accountability for those responsible for
       this.  For those who are seriously  interested  in  alternative  and
       "free energy", this kind of behavior cannot be allowed to continue.

       To do this would result in a total demolition of credibility  in the
       entire community of those conducting research into this field.  That
       is what is in danger.

       I have tried to keep an objective view of this entire "adventure". I
       have basically reported   the   events  as  they  occurred,  however
       distasteful they may be.  This basically  has been written down as a
       record for myself more than anything else.  If at some  point in the
       future I encounter   some  extraordinary  phenomena  which  deserves
       praise, that's exactly what it will  get.  Until then, I impatiently
       await that day.

       Vanguard Note..

          An associated  KeelyNet  file is MAGICSQ which deals  with  magic
          squares and  how  they  can be "constructed" with coils and other
          electrical components  in  such   a   fashion   as   to   produce
          replicating, kaleidoscope  "mirrors" for the express  purpose  of
          redirecting or focusing energy.  Much like a parabolic mirror.
          The Perrigo  patent  used  a  series  of coils (10 X 10), wrapped
          around nails and all connected  together  to  form  a  matrix  or
          pattern which sequentially collected energy from  what was termed
          an "Aether  collector".   If  energy  continually  flows into the
          planet, then there is a "wind"  which  should  be able to drive a
          substance or compound of substances.

          My personal  opinion  is  that  such  a  device   would  be  best
          constructed by using Chladni vibrating waveplates injected INTO a
          substance.  This  would  create  a "tuneable" interference matrix
          associated with the substance and thus act as a down-converter or
          frequency divider for the flow  of force.  I too have seen one of
          these Noyes Matrixes and it consisted of multiple  colors of wire
          wound on  3  arms  that  all  converged  in  the center.  The man
          selling them wanted $1000 and claimed that you could "feel" a hot
          or cold wind over them.  I tried as did several of my friends and
          none of us could feel a thing.  The man also "dowsed" it and said
          "woops, I had it turned off", he then fiddled with some wires and
          said to try again.

          Once more  we  tried  and  nothing could be felt.  I asked if any
          temperature measurements had  been  made  and  the  man said that
          regular temperature  measuring instruments WOULD  NOT  WORK  with
          this technology!   I also asked what was the basis for the device
          operation and the man said it was secret but I could buy the unit
          for $1000 and find it out.  Colored  wires  and  2  X 4s that did
          nothing for $1000, yeah, RIGHT!

          But I  do  have a friend, Dr. Dan Haley who visited  Doyle  Noyes
          while he  was still in Missouri.  Dan says Noyes was located in a
          2 story building and when he visited  it  was  very cold outside.
          Dan reports  that  the  temperature  in  the building  was  quite
          comfortable and  he  did  notice  one  very odd thing.  As he was
          walking down a stairway, he held  onto  a metal railing which WAS
          WARM TO  THE  TOUCH!  Now, metal is normally cool  and  that  was
          quite an  interesting observation.  I guess the question is "DOES
          IT WORK FOR YOU?".  That is not  really a marketable approach nor
          one that most people could duplicate, so I think I will devote my
          energies to duplicatable, verifiable devices.

          I agree 150% with Mr. Donavan's contention as to  CLAIMS that are
          not substantiated  by  physical  proofs.   My personal experience
          (Jerry) has been that I have NEVER  SEEN  a  WORKING  free energy
          device or anti-gravity device.  Nor have I EVER  claimed  to have
          built a  device  of  this  nature.   There  are  many who DO make
          claims, even to the point of wanting  to "share" their knowledge,
          however, experience  has  shown  this is usually  followed  by  a
          request for money or non-disclosure and/or a secrecy vow.

          Based on   the   limited   histories   we  have  regarding  these
          "alternative technologies"  such  primitive  attitudes  will  NOT
          result in  the  public  use of the principles except  within  the
          domain (and DOMINION) of secretive people.

          It is  a  pity that some choose to withhold the majority of their
          information and learning from  history,  it  has  been shown such
          knowledge dies with the inventor or is otherwise repressed.

          We must  all  remain on our guard and continue  to  OPENLY  share
          information.  There   is  no  doubt  that  some  devices  can  be
          considered "proprietary"  if they  are  intended  for  commercial
          profit OR are outright WEAPONS.  That is the main  reason for the
          establishment of  KeelyNet, to make freely available a wide range
          of information that in itself holds keys to HOW we might approach
          the construction of working machines.

          We can only hope that everyone  will grow into a "walks the talk"
          mode.
                             Escape to a higher order!
