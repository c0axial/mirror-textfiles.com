                           ANTI-GRAVITY CHARGED MASS LAW
                                        by
                              Richard L. Clark, Ph.D

       Anti-gravity is relatively  proportionate  to the charge of the mass
       of a body with respect to the charge  of  a  planet's mass.  This is
       the basic fact   of  the  De  Palma,  Searle  and   Townsend   Brown
       experiments and designs.

       All of the  men  create  capacitive elements, via charge or spinning
       charge, to make anti-gravity units relative to the planet Earth.

       The general law is simply:

            Anti-gravity can be generated  in  any  mass  of  matter if the
            poles of the atomic fields are aligned in a linear polarity.

       This is exactly like the molecular alignment necessary  in  magnetic
       domains to produce  magnetism  in  a bar magnet.  Interestingly, the
       bumble bee is an excellent example  of this natural fact.  Its wings
       are electrostatic generators in an air medium, and  it  is  an anti-
       gravity flier.

       Let us now  make  a repeatable, scientific experiment using any five
       humans as an anti-gravity system.  Four standing people form a small
       square, with the fifth person sitting  on  a  stool or chair, in the
       center.  All five face in the same direction.

       In unison, all five must bend at the waist while exhaling all of the
       air from their lungs.  Then, all five straighten up  in unison while
       inhaling deeply.  This   bending   and   straightening  sequence  is
       repeated at least seven times.

       On the seventh bending/exhaling, the  two people in front each place
       one index finger under each knee of the seated person.   At the same
       time, the two  people  in  the rear each place an index finger under
       each armpit of the seated person.

       Then, as the five straighten up and  inhale  for  seventh  time, the
       four lift the  seated  person  over their heads effortlessly,  using
       only the index fingers.

       The unison breathing  and  bending causes the atoms in the air to be
       lined up and  an  anti-gravity system  is  created  by  this  simple
       exercise.

       After doing this experiment it will be obvious that  flying  saucers
       with anti-gravity systems, can be built.  It is again observation
       of nature, neutral centers, and standing columnar waves.

       The impact of  the above new physics law changes all of the concepts
       of gravity, inertia,  electricity,   magnetism,  time,  space,  etc.
       completely.  This is  not  an addition, revision,  or  expansion  of
       current physics; it is a new physics.

       Moving a 60  ton block for the Great Pyramid or Stonehenge is simple
       to explain or  do.   Designing radically  new  transportation,  free
       energy, and totally non-hydrocarbon and non-nuclear  systems for all
       of our needs is practical and possible with this basis system.

       Physics today is  an  elegant treatment of the least common state of
       raw, random nature in the entropy  state.   We  can now engineer the
       basic forces of the universe via information and  intelligence  -  -
       negative entropy.
