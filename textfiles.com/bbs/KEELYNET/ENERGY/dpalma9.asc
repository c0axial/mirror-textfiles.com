A review of: "The Homopolar Handbook", by Thomas Valone, self published,
Integrity Institute, 1377 K Street NW, suite 204, Washington D.C. 20005; 1994

                               by Bruce DePalma
                             Auckland, New Zealand
                                2 February 1995

Recently a copy of Valone's Homopolar Handbook was sent to me for review.

Because Valone's book represents so well what is wrong with America and why
America has become a third rate scientific power, it is worthy of comment.

Comments about a first rate, world class, scientific invention often reveal
much more about the critics than they do about the invention. In the argot of
contemporary language Thomas Valone could be summed up as a science groupie
wherein the admonition, "a little knowledge is a dangerous thing" finds
realization.

We are ingratiated into his presence by his easy familiarity with Bruce, Adam,
Tim, and George. His presence in the formative days of the free energy
revolution is chronicled.

With the insight and perspicacity of an experienced name dropper, junior
college instructor, and scientific dilettante he presents a carefully selected
panoply of l9th and early 20th century scientific writings concerning unipolar
induction.

Although he does admit there are ambiguous and unexplained phenomena of
electricity production and torque reaction in the homopolar machine "his"
experiments suggest the efficiency of energy generation in the N-machine /
S.P.G. can never exceed 100%.

Without understanding and familiarity with unipolar induction many of his
readers would be impressed with his and his professors ignorance of the basic
phenomena of electromagnetism.

But the greatest error of all is his presumption that if "he" cannot reproduce
the experiments of DePalma, Trombly and Tewari then the experiments are at
fault.   With this he joins the ranks of those who "proved" man cannot exceed
15 m.p.h., heavier than air machines cannot fly, electricity cannot be
transmitted down wires, and free energy is impossible.

The costing programs of Trombly and Mitchell are carefully recorded connoting
Valone's true fascination with money. The monstrous contraption of Parker
Kinetic Designs, a child of the greed induced collaboration of Richard
Marshall and William Weldon, presided over by Herb Woodson, formerly of the
D.C. White-Woodson "Energy Laboratory" of M.I.T., appears on the cover of his
tract.

Because the phenomena of unipolar induction are so fundamental to electrical
science and the benefits of a change in the paradigm of electrical power
generation are so incredible, one can view the reaction to the N-machine /
S.P.G. and its technology as an indictment of America and American science
rather than as an affront to the workers who are bringing this technology into
existence.

Valone derives his supercilious kicks from deriding Adam Trombly, who, because
he has been gagged by the DoD and had his experimental setup confiscated,
cannot defend himself.

The management of America, the lawyers and politicians, have finally resorted
to confiscation of patents in the name of national security.

You will note the "Fara-Drum" is part of a weapons system to propel
projectiles at velocities greater than achievable with chemically powered
cannons. No thought is given to energy applications of a life supporting
nature designed to reduce the cost of electricity for the general public.

No first rate, world class scientist would have anything to do with a system
of secrecy and intimidation funded at the trough of U.S. government supported
"scientific" research. The Fara-Drum will go the way of the Super-Collider
while the mountain of public debt grows ever higher.

If I felt that the introduction of a new form of energy extraction into the
world were simply a matter of convincing or the winning of scientific
arguments then I might be inclined to refute point by point.

Suffice it to say that Valone omits in his report two seminal papers:

   The Kincheloe Report, "Homopolar 'Free Energy' Generator Test",
   presented at the 1986 meeting of the Society for Scientific Exploration,
   San Francisco; (see DPALMA5.ASC on KeelyNet)

   and DePalma's: "On the Possibility of Extraction of Electrical Energy
   Directly from Space", Speculations in Science and Technology, Vol. 13, No.
   4, page 283, 1990.  (see DPALMA1.ASC on KeelyNet)

Professor Kincheloe's report is possibly the most carefully analyzed report on
an N-machine presently in general circulation. It concludes N-machine drag is
13% - 20% of what would be measured on a conventional induction generator
delivering the same amount of power.

The rationale of Valone and his ilk is that they are providing a service to
humanity by ferreting out the "truth". What results is the duplicitous serving
of a crypto-technical state whose intentions are a new world order where the
ends justify the means. The debt ridden state of America trembles at the
thought of technical innovation in energy generation.

Eighty to ninety percent of the cost of energy is required to service the debt
of the utilities incurred in the era of atomic energy and to maintain the
salaries of the executives and meter readers, not to speak of the maintenance
of long distance power lines.

A more local energy system based on direct extraction of energy from space,
without burning or consumption of fuel would delight the populace. Capital
would desert the present monstrous complex of environmentally destructive
atomic and coal fired boilers and turbines. The Fara-Drum monstrosity speaks
to the arid world of a technically controlled society ruled by the gun of
conservation, read corruption.

In a world which has passed beyond the gentlemanly dialogues and colloquia of
the 19th and early 20th century is it not clear to be seen in the rising
waters, earthquakes, fires, and plagues upon mankind, God's answer to the
acolytes and servitors of greed and ego.
