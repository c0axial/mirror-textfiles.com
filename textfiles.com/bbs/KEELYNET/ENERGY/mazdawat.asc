If anyone comes up with a gadget that does wonders for pollution control, and
increases engine efficiency, then the only way to get it into production is to
do what Phillips did with the cassette tape deck and the CD disk. ie. Give the
patent away to anyone who wants it, and forget about making money from the
idea.

The trouble is that everyone who devises one of these miracle engines wants to
make big money with the idea.  Trouble is the oil companies and the Government
don't like that too much, as it will destroy whole economies.

If you don't believe me, take a look at Mazda in Japan.

They developed a water powered engine that they said could be in production by
1995.  When they made the news release in 1993, they qualified it by saying
that production would follow discussions with the major oil companies.

Since then there hasn't been a peep out of Mazda. I'm assuming from their
silence that even they can't fight the oil companies.  So what chance does the
little guy with his homemade Carburetta have?

A 50% increase in engine efficiency means a 50% drop in revenue for an oil
company.  Look what BP did when Saddam Hussein stole their oil wells in
Kuwait.  14 Billion US tax dollars and 1 Gulf war later, BP had their oil
wells back again.

Do you really think that the UN Security Council gave a damn about the
sovereignty of Kuwait?  Think about Bosnia for a minute.  The UNSC couldn't
give a damn about them because there's no money in it.

We just have the illusion of freedom to do what we want to.

Peter.
