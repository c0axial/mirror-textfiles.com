                             Original posting 04/01/87

       Does any one  have  any  ideas  one  how to make an omni-directional
       longitudinal scalar wave Receiver & Transmitter?

       In contrast to the common Hertzian  transverse  vector waves, scalar
       waves travel, or  rather  materialize  at  the  receiving   end,  at
       superluminal velocities.   Scalar   waves   also  quite  effectively
       penetrate trough objects, such as a Faraday Shield, which would
       stop an ordinary electromagnetic (Hertzian type) wave.

       Shown below is a simple directional,  (If  there  is such a thing as
       being 'too' directional, this system is it!), scalar wave
       generator/detector.

       What I am  looking for is a system that doesn't require  LASER  like
       beam alignment.   Any one have any ideas?

            See Popular  Electronics  August 1980, PG 94 & 95, for a simple
       PFM Modulator/Demodulator.  Tune  the  carrier  frequency so that it
       falls in the "Experimenters band" of 160 to 180 Kilo-Cycles.

          [Note :  By definition Hertzian type waves are transverse  vector
                  waves.  So  the units used when referring to scalar waves
                  should be given in the old form of Cycles-Per-Second
                  (Kilocycles, KC   or   Mega-Cycles,   MC),   to   prevent
                  confusion.]

            Just for  the  fun  of  it, try to measure the  impedance,  and
       inductance, of the  Caduceus  coil,  and  find  its natural resonant
       frequencies.
