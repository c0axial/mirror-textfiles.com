            p. 333-355.   In this paper Whittaker proved that all scalar
            EM potentials  have an internal, organized, bidirectional EM
            plane-wave structure.  Thus there exists an electromagnetics
            that is  totally internal to the scalar EM potential.  Since
            vacuum/spacetime is  scalar potential, then this internal EM
            is  in   fact  "internal"   to   the   local   potentialized
            vacuum/spacetime.    For  discovery  of  the  Whittaker-type

            shown by  their nonreaction  to Ignatovich's paper that they
            have not  yet  realized  that  this  is  a  methodology  for
            directly engineering  quantum  change,  and  hence  physical
            reality itself.

            showed  that  all  the  classical  electromagnetics  can  be
            replaced by  scalar potential  interferometry.  This ignored
            paper anticipated the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect by 55 years,
            and drastically  extended it as well.  Indeed, it prescribes
            a  macroscopic   AB  effect  that  is  distance-independent,
            providing a direct and engineerable mechanism for action-at-
            a-distance.   It also  provides a  testable  hidden-variable
            theory that predicts drastically new and novel effects.

            of the electromagnetic theory of light," American Journal of
            Science, Vol.  5, Fourth Series, May 1898, p. 343-348.  Even
            though Barus  actually discovered  the  "backward-traveling"
            Maxwellian  EM  wave  in  1898,  modern  Western  scientists
            essentially ignored  his work,  and did  not rediscover  the
            time-reversed EM  wave until  it appeared in the open Soviet
            literature.   See also  Robert A. Fisher, Ed., Optical Phase
            Conjugation, Academic Press, New York, 1983, p. xv.  In 1972
            two  Soviet  scientists,  from  the  P.N.  Lebedev  Physical
            Institute in  Moscow, visited  Lawrence  Livermore  National
            Laboratory and  mentioned to  U.S.  scientists  Dr.  B.  Ya.
            Zel'dovich's observation of an extremely curious "distortion
            undoing" property of the stimulated Brillouin backscattering
            process in  a CS2-filled  waveguide.   This  of  course  was
            nonlinear optical  phase conjugation and its production of a
            time-reversed  EM   wave,  the  strange  new  EM  wave  that
            "reversed disorder  and restored  order."   Thereafter, U.S.
            scientists  gradually   began  working   in  optical   phase
            conjugation.   Most of  them, however, still have difficulty
            with the  fact that the phase conjugate wave is a true time-
            reversed wave.    Many  do  not  understand  the  difference
            between true  time reversal  (true  phase  conjugation)  and
            pseudo-phase-conjugation.

            On  p.   156,  Pepper   specifically  notes  that  "...these
            processing techniques  can, in  principle,  be  extended  to
            other  portions   of  the  EM  spectrum  (e.g.,  rt,  radio,
            microwave, radars,  UV, etc.);  and can  also involve  other
            fields (e.g.,  acoustic waves),  given the  proper nonlinear
            medium."   In other  words, phase conjugation is a universal
            nonlinear phenomenon,  unknown  until  recently.    Pepper's
            paper   is presently  the best  all-around  introduction  to
            nonlinear optical phase conjugation in the English language.

       11.  There is  a good reason for using two frequencies.  To first
            (rough) order, the earth may be approximated as an isotropic
            nonlinear material.   In  that case, a sine-wave transmitted
            into  the   earth  will   simply  break   up,  due   to  the
            nonlinearities.    However,  if  two  sine  waves  separated
            somewhat in  frequency are  input into  the earth,  but  one
            pretends  that  one  transmitted  the  difference  frequency
            between them,  the difference  frequency will  act as  if it
            were a sign wave transmitted through a linear, nondistorting
            medium __  even though  the individual  two waves suffer all
            sorts of  distortion, breakdown,  etc.   This is  a  way  of
            "linearizing"  a   nonlinear  situation   if  it  isn't  too
            nonlinear.

            the photo  on p.  75 of Pepper, Scientific American, 254(1),
            Jan. 1986.   Do  you see  that, if a heat source scatters EM
            energy into  a surrounding  phase conjugate mirror, you will
            get some  of the scattered energy re-ordered and returned to
            the source?

       13.  An amusing  lay description  of Tesla's  experiment with the
            accidental build-up  of "earthquake-like"  resonance in  the
            buildings and area surrounding his New York laboratory, from
            induction  by   a  tiny   electromechanical  oscillator,  is
            contained in  Margaret  Cheney,  Tesla:  Man  Out  of  Time,
            Prentice-Hall, Inc.,  Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 1981, p.
            115-116.   Slightly more  light is  shed on  the incident by
            John J.  O'Neill, Prodigal Genius: The Life of Nikola Tesla,
            Angriff Press, Hollywood, California, 1981, New Printing, p.
            155-165.

       14.  See John  J. O'Neill,  Prodigal Genius,  p. 164-165.   Tesla
            stated that his telegeodynamic oscillator, so small it could
            be slipped  into a  pocket, could be attached to any part of
            the Empire  State Building  and in  12 to  13 minutes  would
            bring the  building  to  full  resonance,  and  destroy  it.
            O'Neill could  not make  out the decimal point in his notes,
            so could  not be  sure Tesla stated it would require 0.25 HP
            or 2.5  HP.   We point out that it must have been 0.25 if it
            was to  be slipped  into a  rather large  pocket.   A 2.5 HP
            electric motor  of the  time would rather definitely not fit
            in one's  pocket!   See also Cheney, Tesla: Man Out of Time,
            p. 116-117, 275.

            Tesla  indicated  that  his  telegeodynamics  could  project
            enormous energy through the earth, essentially without loss.
            In other  references he  indicated  that  the  energy  would
            travel in  beams to  distant points  on the earth, producing
            desired effects  there.   He  also  indicated  that  he  was
            utilizing  a   unique  form   of  resonance   not  presently
            understood by  science.   Suppose we  assume that  Tesla had
            discovered the  mechanical analogue of the nonlinear optical

                                      Page 3

            pumped  phase  conjugate  mirror.    Then  his  "oscillator"
            actually  involved   mechanically   pumping   (by   opposing
            mechanical waves  or blows)  a suitable nonlinear mechanical
            phase conjugation mirror material.  If timed at a mechanical
            resonance frequency  of the  material,  and  attached  to  a
            building, an interesting phenomenon would occur.  The scalar
            EM potential  base  waves  for  rhythmic  scalar  mechanical
            stress waves  have an  affinity for  traveling  through  the
            atomic nucleus  and its immediately adjacent vacuum.  Recall
            that, in QM, all mechanical forces are generated by exchange
            of virtual  photons, so  opposing  forces  in  a  mechanical
            stress are caused by bidirectional virtual photon exchanges.
            It is  "scalar electromagnetic"  at base.   As the scalar EM
            stress potential  wave  travels  through  its  vacuum/nuclei
            medium, the  normal electron  orbital vibrations  (including
            those  caused   from  covalent   bond  vibrations,   lattice
            vibrations, and  temperature vibrations)  constitute "signal
            wave inputs,"  causing the  gating  and  emission  of  phase
            conjugate replica  waves from the pumped nuclei out into the
            material lattices.   If the stress pumping is at a resonance
            frequency  of   the  material/nuclei,   or  a   harmonic  or
            subharmonic  of   it,  then   nonlinear  oscillation  theory
            together  with   E.T.  Whittaker's   bidirectional  EM  wave
            composition of  the scalar stress potential will result in a
            phase-locked buildup or accumulation of the gated PCR energy
            from  the   activated  vacuum/nuclei   internal  medium   by
            constructive interference  of the  continually-gated PCR  EM
            energy into  the material lattice at its resonant frequency.
            In that  case a  "forced resonance"  condition occurs in the
            building,  surrounding   earth,  etc.,   and   this   scalar
            mechanical stress  resonance spreads and builds, to enormous
            power __  even to  the destruction  of the building or to an
            earthquake.

            But since the oscillator itself has certainly not input such
            a large  amount of  energy, from  whence does  all the extra
            energy come?   The answer is contained in Sweet and Bearden,
            "Utilizing scalar  electromagnetics to  tap vacuum  energy,"
            IECEC '91,  ibid.   The activated nuclei, in this mechanical
            scalar oscillator  case,  actually  involve  an  oscillation
            modulated upon  the virtual photon flux exchange between the
            activated local  vacuum and  each activated nucleus, similar
            to the  type of  oscillation that  Sweet traps in the barium
            nuclei of  his vacuum  triode.  This scalar oscillation onto
            the activated  nucleus converts  that nucleus  to  a  pumped
            phase conjugate  mirror (PPCM).   Covalent bond oscillations
            and material  lattice  vibrations  introduce  "signal  wave"
            inputs into  the pumped nucleus through the EM coupling with
            its electron  shells.   Amplified  phase  conjugate  replica
            (PCR) waves  are thus  emitted  by  these  PPCM  nuclei,  in
            response to  the signal  wave inputs.  According to standard
            PPCM theory,  these amplified  PCR waves will thus leave the
            nucleus and  travel out through the electron shells into the
            material lattice,  being  scattered  there.    This  process
            effectively  gates   energy  from   the  vacuum/nucleus  VPF
            exchange into  the PCR  waves, which  "backtrack" the signal
            wave input  path, back  out into the material lattices, etc.
            If the  pumping is  at the  fundamental, a  harmonic,  or  a
            subharmonic of  the resonance  frequency of  the  materials,

                                      Page 4

            then the scattered energy will accumulate "in phase" and the
            materials and  building will  be  in  increasing  resonance.
            Thus the building and the local earth will begin to build up
            increasing, rumbling  oscillations, as  the  increasing  PCR
            waves from  the PPCM  nuclei scatter  increasing energy into
            their constituent  materials.   The enormous energy involved
            is actually  organized and  gated  from  the  excited  local
            vacuum itself.

            As to  Tesla's telegeodynamics  and making  mechanical waves
            that are  laser-like and  travel through the earth, one need
            only apply  the known  principle of  the  forward-going  PCR
            wave.   In other  words, one  deliberately inputs,  say, two
            small signal  waves.   The PPCM material acts as if a single
            signal wave had been input, as a vector resultant wave.  The
            resulting  amplified   PCR  wave   thus   "backtracks"   the
            resultant.   If the  resultant signal  wave input is a sharp
            laser-like incoming  beam, then the responding amplified PCR
            wave  will  be  a  sharp  laser-like  beam  in  the  reverse
            direction.     In  such   manner,  a  laser-like  mechanical
            oscillation beam  can be  launched through  the earth.   The
            laser-like portion is based on a laser-like scalar potential
            beam that  travels through  the vacuum  and atomic nuclei as
            its natural  medium.   Such a beam should travel through the
            earth or  through the ocean with ease, since the scalar wave
            is gravitational,  and not  affected by the ionized electron
            shells of seawater, e.g.  Note that, by slightly varying the
            signal wave  input resultant,  one can  "steer" the PCR wave
            through its  medium (the  vacuum/atomic nuclei),  much as  a
            phased array  radar steers  its  beam  through  space.    It
            strongly suggests  that one  can make  an underwater  scalar
            radar or  a "through the intervening earth" scalar radar, as
            well.

       22.  Even Einstein __ who was awarded the Nobel Prize in part for
            explaining the photoelectric effect __ never understood what
            a photon was.  In his later years Einstein wrote: "All these

                                      Page 7

            50  years  of  pondering  have  not  brought  me  closer  to
            answering  the  question:  what  are  light-quanta?".    The
            quotation is contained in P. Speziali, Ed., Albert Einstein-
            Michele  Besso  Correspondence  1903-1955,  Hermann,  Paris,
            1972.    There  are  formidable  problems  with  the  photon
            concept.   E.g., the  "energy" of a photon is not localized,
            but is  distributed over  the entire volume of the field and
            there is,  in general,  no use  in attaching a coordinate to
            the photon.   A  photon in  general cannot be described by a
            wavefunction, but  only for  special cases.   In geometrical
            optics as  well as  Maxwell's electrodynamics,  there is  no
            room for  photons.    The  complex  one-photon  wavefunction
            should not  be identified  with the  electromagnetic  field.
            For a  given photon  number, the electric or magnetic fields
            at a  point cannot  be measured  as a function of time.  For
            states with  a fixed photon number, the expectation value of
            the electric  field is  zero even  for a  very large  photon
            number, so  that in  this case  the correspondence principle
            cannot be  used.   For additional  strong anomalies  in  the
            concept of a photon, see J. Strand, "Photons in introductory
            quantum physics,"  American Journal  of Physics, 54(7), July
            1986, p. 650-652.

       23.  Richard Kidd  et  Al,  "Evolution  of  the  Modern  Photon,"
            American Journal  of Physics,  57(1), Jan.  1989, p.  27-35.
            Note particularly  that detection  is actually  binary,  but
            one-half of each detection/measurement is normally discarded
            [actually, it  is just hidden and listed as simply "Newton's
            third  law   reaction  force."].     See   also   R.   Chen,
            "Cancellation  of  Internal  Forces,"  American  Journal  of
            Physics, 49(4),  Apr. 1981,  p. 372  for the  fact that  the
            internal EM  energy is  always involved in interactions, but
            usually never taken into account.

            Indeed, the  so-called "photon  interaction"  is  usually  a
            spin-2 graviton  breakup interaction.  The graviton fissions
            (the photon  and antiphoton  decouple).    The  photon  half
            normally interacts with the electron shells.  The antiphoton
            half "burrows  back into" the nucleus and interacts with it,
            providing  the   Newtonian  third   law   recoil   and   the
            conservation  of   angular  momentum,   energy,  etc.    The
            ubiquitous presence  of the  Newtonian  third  law  reaction
            force is  direct and positive evidence for the fact that not
            only a photon interacts, but an antiphoton interacts also.

            Consider.     Quantum  field   theory  requires  that  every
            mechanical   force    be   generated   by   virtual   photon
            interactions.   Therefore, to  be consistent, Newton's third
            law reaction  force must be generated by photon interaction.
            Since the  3rd law  force is  considered to be universal, it
            means that  the "photon interaction that is a reverse of the
            normal photon  interaction" is universal, and this "reversed
            photon" interaction  must  normally  accompany  each  normal
            photon interaction.  We point  out that  the  only  type  of
            photon that  would consistently  produce the  exact opposite
            force from the photon interaction would be a phase conjugate
            or time-reversal of that photon.  I.e., there must have been
            two photons  present in the interaction: the normal or time-
            forward photon,  and the  time-reversed or antiphoton.  This

                                      Page 7

            is actually  implied by  a quantum field theory statement of
            Newton's third law.

            However, the point can be even more rigorously proven.  In a
            phase conjugate  material, one can trick the antiphoton into
            exiting out  of the  atom, instead  of  interacting  in  the
            nucleus.  In that case, according to the "photon interaction
            is normally  graviton interaction" principle, the agent that
            normally generates  Newton's third  law recoil did not reach
            the nucleus,  and so the recoil should be absent.  And it is
            absent, in  actual experiments.    Such  a  phase  conjugate
            mirror does not recoil if it emits a phase conjugate replica
            wave (phase  conjugate photons,  or antiphotons).    And  it
            doesn't  recoil  no  matter  how  powerful  that  antiphoton
            emission is  __ no matter how many antiphotons it emits.  On
            the other  hand, if  the same  material  emits  an  ordinary
            photon, it  does recoil,  and Newton's third law is present.
            This  experiment   directly  establishes  that  most  photon
            interactions actually  are graviton  interactions __  paired
            photon/antiphoton interactions.

       24.  To see  just how  arbitrary and  postulational  are  present
            "definitions" of  mass and  force, see  Robert Bruce Lindsay
            and  Henry   Margenau,   Foundations   of   Physics,   Dover
            Publications, New  York, 1963, p. 283-287.  Note on page 283
            that a  "field of  force" at  any point  is actually defined
            only for the case when a unit mass is present at that point.
            See also Richard P. Feynman, Robert B. Leighton, and Matthew
            Sands, The  Feynman Lectures on Physics, Addison-Wesley, New
            York, Vol  1, p. 2-4, for a definition of the electric field
            in context  of its  potentiality for producing a force.  The
            modern  view  of  the  field  is  that,  because  of  vacuum
            fluctuations, rigorously  one  no  longer  speaks  of  "the"
            field,  but   of  the  probability  of  a  particular  field
            configuration.   See Charles  W. Misner,  Kip S. Thorne, and
            John Archibald  Wheeler, Gravitation,  W.H. Freeman and Co.,
            San Francisco,  1973, p. 1191.  Note that this view is still
            in error  when one  considers  electron  precession  in  the
            interaction of vacuum "fields" and the electron gas inside a
            detecting probe wire.
