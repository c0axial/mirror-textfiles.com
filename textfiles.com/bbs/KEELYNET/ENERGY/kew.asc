              Kinetic Energy Weapons (KEWs) verses Lorentz - 05/20/88

       For those of  you  who  may have just tuned in, you may be wondering
       why, we are discussing Kinetic Energy Weapons (KEWs for short) here.
       It started with  my  question  on   which  issue  of  "The  American
       Rifleman", had info on a Railgun (Does any one know the issue?).

       I'll speculate that mention of Railguns was prompted  by the article
       in Circuit Cellar  Ink  #2,  "Circuit  Cellar Neighborhood Strategic
       Defense Initiative [,]  The  Ballistic   Dynamics  of  Plastic  Soda
       Bottles" by Steve Ciarcia & Ed Nisley.  So here we are at:

                  "Kinetic Energy Weapons (KEWs) verses Lorentz".

       Also related is the 'thread' of messages on making  the Plastic Soda
       Bottle into a capacitor, and charging it to a high voltage potential
       to increase lift, without increasing fuel.

       Its taken me  a  lot  longer  to  get  this  message composed that I
       thought it would, some of the references,  to  say  the  least,  are
       obscure, and took time to find them.

       I want to explain some things here, I am not a physicist, nor have I
       had any formal education in such areas.  I simply have  a  desire to
       read things that  most people politely term esoteric and ignore with
       out further thought.  My desire to read the esoteric has resulted in
       my accumulation of a rather large  collection  of odds-and-ends that
       "don't fit in"  with accepted physical "Laws", for example:  Railgun
       verses Lorentz.

       The one common  tread  that runs between all of these odds-and-ends,
       is that there are usually some 'anomalies'  to  each  of the "Laws",
       that the "Law" itself does not account for, at some  scale.  My view
       is that if  it  is  a "Law" it should work no matter what the scale,
       from microscopic to  macroscopic.   As  an  example,  Lorentz's  law
       didn't break down until someone tried to use macroscopic currents in
       a Railgun.

       From Ref #2:

             "It is important to realize that the mismatch  between  theory
              and observation  is  not  some  barely  discernible quantity.
              [It] involves factors in the thousands."

              So says   Peter  Graneau,   a   Physicist   at   Northeastern
              University's Center of Electromagnetics Research,  commenting
              on anomalies  in Lorentz's force law.  "The situation is more
              than academic bickering,  since  the  formula  is  one of the
              pillars of relativity theory."

             "Graneau has shown that objects move, buckle  and  break under
              forces that   are   not   found  in  current  electromagnetic
              equations."

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       From Ref #3:

             "...the Ampere  and  Lorentz   laws   only  agree  for  closed
              circuits.  When the source of the electromagnetic effect
              is an isolated current element, a large discrepancy appears."

             "Amperean forces  also  explain  the  wire fragmentation  that
              occurs at high currents.  Current-element analysis also

              explains the  existence  of  the longitudinal electromagnetic
              waves that  were observed  by  Radio  pioneer  Nikola  Tesla.
              Because such   waves   cannot   be  derived  from   Maxwell's
              equations, Tesla's experiments were ignored..."
              [Or were   they  actively  suppressed?   See  the  references
              referring to T. E. Bearden, and Scalar waves.]

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       From ref #5:

             "A physicist [Peter Graneau]  at  Northeastern  University has
              found that current pulses in water can develop  strong forces
              which, when  contained in a gun barrel, produce unprecedented
              muzzle velocities."

             "...Northeastern's new electromagnetics  research  center  has
              uncovered a  new  'electrodynamic'  phenomenon,   dubbed  the
              "alpha torque,"   that   only   manifests  itself  in  liquid
              conductors like air, water  and  molten  metals.  The results
              show that the new method of propulsion can easily out-perform
              both chemical explosives and electromagnetic rail guns."

             "The crucial issue is how electric arcs generate  these forces
              in fluids.   We  have given up on thermodynamic explanations.
              Ruling out gravitational and  nuclear  forces,  there  really
              remains no choice but to seek an electrodynamic explanation,"

             "Graneau calculates that a 2-million-amp arc  explosion  in  a
              350-meter barrel would accelerate a 20-kg projectile to 13 km
              per second."

             "Graneau has   had   to  resurrect  an  older  formulation  of
              electromagnetic theory   in   order   to   explain   the  arc
              explosions.  The  theory  was  originated   by   the   French
              physicist Andre-Marie  Ampere  at  the  beginning of the 19th
              century and  was  further  elaborated  by  A.  F.  Neuman  in
              Germany."

              In the  modern formulation, the Lorentz formula  governs  the
              movement of electrons in electromagnetic fields.

             "Applying the  Lorentz  formula  to  the water arc experiments
              leads to an entirely different  prediction  of the propagated
              forces.  A  much smaller force acting to contain  the  plasma
              was predicted,  and  this  helped  derail applications of arc
              forces."

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Here are a few notes of my own.

       Lightning is an arc force.  So what are some useful things we can do
       with it?  The projectiles that are  fired  by KEWs must survive, and
       maintain there aerodynamic properties, when they impact with the air
       at the end of their muzzles.

       Firing a bullet at 10 km per second into air, would  be like driving
       your car into a brick wall at 1000 mph; instant pan-cake.  Some type

                                      Page 3





       of ceramic material  would probably be the best avenue to pursue for
       the projectile.

       Can we pick up some distilled water,  or maybe mineral water (a good
       point to experiment with), at the super market, a few  dozen 300,000
       uF caps at  a  hamfest,  and make our own arc force powered 'Plastic
       Soda Bottle' launcher, without blowing ourself up?

       I brought up   (a)ether,  and  you   brought   up   Michelson/Morley
       experiment, so lets see where we can go with that:

       This is what my dictionary has to say about (a)ether:

              E-ther: Noun.

                  1)  Chem.  a.)  A colorless,  mobile,  volatile,
                                  aromatic liquid compound,  ethyl   oxide,
                                  (C2H5)2O,  made by the action of sulfuric
                                  acid on  alcohol:   used as an anesthetic
                                  and solvent.

                             b.)  Any of  a  group  of organic compounds in
                                  which an oxygen atom is  joined  with two
                                  organic radicals.

                  2)  A   solid  or  semi-solid,   perfectly elastic medium
                      formerly [?] assumed  to  pervade all of space and to
                      be responsible for  the  transmission of light, heat,
                      gravitational effects, and all forms  of  energy  and
                      radiation.

                  3)  The upper air.

                    Also spelled "AETHER" (for defs. 2 and 3).

                 [<L aether sky <Gk. aither < aithein burn, shine]


       I'll go with  the  'aether'  spelling  from here on out, so that the
       "aromatic liquid" of definition number  one (1) doesn't smell up the
       place.

       The  Michelson/Morley experiment,  of  1881  and 1887,  proved  that
       aether didn't exist?  Well you are correct; almost.  M&M  set out to
       prove, or disprove,  that  the  "perfectly  elastic  [static] medium
       assumed to pervade all of space" did, or did not, exist.   Or to put
       it an other way, since it was believed  the aether was stationary in
       space, which the  Earth  passed through, there would  be  an  aether
       'wind'.

       The  M&M experiment  did  virtually  prove for certain that a static
       aether, or aether wind, DID NOT exist.   Did  I just shoot myself in
       the foot, when I said aether did not exist?  No,  I  didn't,  I said
       they proved that a STATIC aether (or aether wind) did not exist.

       How come if the M&M apparatus is oriented in different directions it
       produces different results,  not  greatly  different,  but different
       none the less?


                                      Page 4





       Could it be  that M&M did not consider, at that time, that a Dynamic
       Aether might exist, one where the  aether  is  constantly in motion,
       with intense local  rotary,  and  wave movements within  the  aether
       space?

       [Was the directionality  thing just one more anomaly in physics that
       got swept under  the rug, when it  couldn't  be  correlated  to  the
       desired outcome of the experiment?]

       The  following statement   would  be  considered   heresy   by   the
       Relativity crowd...but take note of who said it:

           "According to  the  general  theory of relativity, space without
            ether is unthinkable;  for in such a space there not only would
            be no  propagation  of  light,   but  also  no  possibility  of
            existence for standards of space and time [measuring  rods  and
            clocks] nor  therefore any space-time intervals in the physical
            sense."

                         ---  Albert Einstein,  from  an obscure speech  in
                              Leiden, Germany; 1920.  [Did  you  catch  the
                              name there: Albert Einstein?]

                         ---  See  "Sidelights  of  Relativity"  by  Albert
                              Einstein, London, 1922 pg. 23.

       That's all I've got time for at the moment, how about you?
