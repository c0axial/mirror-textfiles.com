Hello all,

I am new to this echo area and I am not sure if anyone has discussed this
topic before.

I have obtained plans for constructing a motor/generator from a Mr. Robert
Adams in New Zealand and I have begun construction.

Seven people have since built this device in Australia and it seems to work
fine, but no-one can explain the effiency anomoly that occurs after about 15
minutes of running time. In the two that I have personally seen, the eff.
rating jumps from 85% (normal) then after about 15 mins goes to around 120%.

We have set up oscilloscopes, amp meters, volt meters, temp meters and can't
account for the increase.

We do not have access to a magnamonitor to measure the magnetic field on the
rotor, but we are still stumped.

Any ideas ? My intention is for it to be a Battery Charger.

Vangard Note

  There are some peculiar activities that have happened with regard to the
  ADAMS motor.  As you can see from the above email, these fellows claim to
  know of 7 people who have successfully replicated the Adams motor.

  In 1993, everyone was hot for it, wanting plans and such.  Within a very
  short period, there was a business arrangement made with Adams which we
  heard was to produce a UNITY motor to be patented and sold in the U.K..

  Sometime toward the end of 1993, the talk was that the ADAMS motor had not
  proven out, that no one had successfully duplicated the effect or there was
  some anomaly in the measurement method.  A very bizarre turnaround if you
  read the above email.

  At the 1994 ISNE meeting, Bill McMurtry of New Zealand gave a presentation
  in which he said flat out that the Adams motor did not work.  We took Bill
  to dinner with Tom Bearden and Ken McNeil, but did not have an opportunity
  to speak with him in detail because he and Ken had some items to discuss in
  private.

  The collaboration of Adams with Bruce Cathie had increased the over unity
  output to numbers that were so incredible as to warrant not publishing them.
  I read something about it being on the order of 1:3000.  At any rate, the
  Adams motor is far from dead if there have been independent successes.
