            Progressive Complexity -  The Equation of All Creation

                               by Peter H. Weis

This brief and simple synopsis deals with the nature of our universe and its
creative forces. In the course of this synopsis it becomes clear that our
universe is CONSTRUCTIVELY DYNAMIC - as the planet under our feet and a single
glance at the firmament shows - and hence, that our universe is governed by a
vast plan and supreme purpose. Since the same forces that have created and
govern the universe and Life alike have also created and govern the existence
of our kind and selves, our existence is automatically endowed with an equally
vast plan and supreme purpose.

When we look at our universe, we see two basic aspects. On the one hand, we
see chaos and decay, and on the other, we see vast and increasingly complex
structure and order - an order so immaculate that it can be described in the
pure logic of mathematics. That the nature and the workings of our universe
can be revealed with the absolute logic of mathematics is the measure of its
own immaculate logic and inviolable Order. For reasons which will forever
baffle me, our scientists have focused exclusively upon the chaos and decay,
and have dismissed the profound structure and immaculate order of our universe
as totally meaningless and "astronomically unlikely accidents' in a
fundamentally chaotic universe.

Consequently, at least in their eyes, our existence is also just as
accidental, and therefore, utterly meaningless and without any purpose
whatsoever. Even today the professional stature and reputation of any
scientist still rests upon this profoundly subjective and deliberate one-eyed
view of our universe. As this synopsis shows, our scientists could not have
been more wrong. Here, the Chaos and the Order of our universe are unified
into the two complementary aspects of an indivisible unity to yield  - akin to
Male and Female - "The Equation of All Creation".

The understanding of the creative forces of our universe by its offspring is
part and parcel of the plan, evolution and supreme purpose of our universe -
and therefore, the star-spun destiny of our kind. And while this understanding
delivers immense cognitive along with real power into the hands of our kind
and selves, its advent in our time also marks the coming of age of our kind
and the evolutionary quantum leap from Homo sapiens, sapiens to Homo nobilis,
stellaris (see "The Emergence of Homo Nobilis, Stellaris" by this author).

However, this cognitive evolutionary quantum leap remains, as always, a matter
of individual choice (see Darwin's recognition of Sexual Selection, a pure
matter of individual choice, even at all instinctual levels). Fortunately, the
creative forces of our universe are almost ridiculously easy to understand;
the average 15 year-old is fully capable of understanding these fundamental
universal forces, at least in principle.

Lest this be construed as the worst kind of anthropocentric hubris by some,
the evolution of the universe and of Life alike are driven by exactly the same
fundamental universal forces, and therefore, the universe harbours billions
of other races on millions of other planets in billions of other galaxies. And
although they differ vastly in form and function according to local
conditions, they all face the same star-spun destiny.

Since the universe as it exists today evolved from the burst of pure energy of
its big bang birth, EVERYTHING that exists MUST be inherent, if only
ultimately, in the nature of energy. Consequently this synopsis begins with
the nature of energy, to see what it may contain. And although an analysis of
the nature of energy  is not everyone's favourite thing, make an exception
this time and you will be richly rewarded. You will be rewarded with a basic
but comprehensive understanding of the universe, of the forces which have
created and govern the universe, the Earth, Life and its evolution, the
emergence of our kind, and thus, the existence of our selves.

Indeed, you will understand the forces of All Creation. And although we are
creatures of the Earth, you will also know that we are first and foremost the
direct product and offspring of the creative forces of our universe itself,
and that our existence is endowed with the same vast plan and supreme purpose
that governs our universe.

We begin with the nature of energy, as stated in the 1st law of
thermodynamics. Everything that follows is as simple and as general as the
first law - as it MUST be ("The almost frightening simplicity and wholeness of
the relationships which nature suddenly opens up before us." Werner
Heisenberg).

The 1st law of thermodynamics describes the nature of energy as follows:

        Energy cannot be created nor destroyed; it can only be changed.

The change of energy into matter, and vice versa, is one example.  The change
of heat into motion (steam engines and automobiles) is another. The change of
gravitational energy into electromagnetic energy (hydro stations) is yet
another.

As the first law clearly states, and as proven by these and myriad other
examples, CHANGE is inherent in the nature of energy. We now have the ultimate
origin of all CHANGE.

Since the 1st law also states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed -
also known as the law of "the conservation of energy" - the STABILITY of
energy in total and as such, is infinite. There is no way around this; the
first law is absolute in this regard (also see the invariance of individual
wavelengths, of quantization, the eternal motion of energy waves. Therefore
then, and as the 1st law clearly states, STABILITY is inherent in the nature
of energy. We have now come upon the ultimate origin of all STABILITY.

Due to their common origin in the fundamental unity of energy, CHANGE &
STABILITY are the polar complements - like positive and negative charge, or
north and south polarity - of a fundamental unity. Consequently CHANGE &
STABILITY are eternally and inextricably interlocked, co-exist simultaneously,
are relative to each other, are superposed one upon an other, and are, except
for quantum transitions, inversely proportional.

Here we have obtained the unification of CHANGE and STABILITY - and thus, the
fundamental Universal Dynamics of CHANGE & STABILITY. The unification and
interlocked interaction of CHANGE and STABILITY yields this infinitely
powerful little theorem:

                  "Infinite CHANGE Within STABLE Parameters"

We encounter essentially the same theorem in Chaos theory, which is most
commonly expressed as (Davies, Penrose, many others) -

    "An Infinite Series of Points (CHANGE) Within a Finite (STABLE) Domain"

     And when re-worded as

                 "Infinite Potential within Finite Parameters"

this little theorem also contains the essence and the foundation of the
concept of the wave function in quantum mechanics.

With the unification of CHANGE & STABILITY, we have also obtained the
unification of Chaos and Order - only the words differ - and solved the
baffling paradox of the simultaneous co-existence of these antipolar
phenomena.

Nevertheless, we retain the terms CHANGE & STABILITY since they refer us back,
explicitly and directly, to the first law of thermodynamics at every turn.
(Apparently, we have also obtained the unification of Infinity and Finity as
the polar complements of a fundamental unity - which boggles my mind no end).

Snowflakes are perhaps the most familiar examples of Infinite CHANGE within
STABLE Parameters. Each snowflake is individually unique, yet conforms
invariably to the form common to all snowflakes. And while there is not one
snowflake on the earth exactly like any other - nor in the entire universe -
nor ever was and never will be, each snowflake is invariably true to the form
common to all. The same holds true of stars, of galaxies, of planets, moons,
trees, cats and dogs, every leaf on every tree, every blade of grass, and even
individual bacteria behave, as Lewis Thomas observed, "as if they have names".

The same holds true for our selves, of course. Each one of us is individually
unique, yet we are all true to the typical human form common to all of us.
Here then, we have the origin and dynamics of individuality, the infinity of
CHANGE within STABLE parameters, the essence of a CHAOS that never repeats
itself, and as such,  the origin and fundamental driving force of the infinite
diversity - within STABLE parameters - of all creation.

The dynamics of CHANGE & STABILITY are quantum in nature and constitute a vast
domain in their own right (and far too extensive to describe here), complete
with its own rich and intricate formalism and structure, along with a wealth
of profound and immensely powerful new insights.

Among a myriad other insight, some of the major consequences inherent in
CHANGE & STABILITY Dynamics are; the as yet missing half of the complete
equation of quantum theory (a purely causative quantum theory similar to
Bohm's theory); a quantum cosmos; a direct avenue to the unification of the
four forces; a vast new dimension to E=mc(2); the profoundly important
function of black holes; as well as the foundation for what may well be called
"The Equation Of All Creation".

The complementary bi-polar nature of CHANGE & STABILITY Dynamics also strongly
suggest similar higher level polarities among time, space, energy and matter.
Since these dynamics will occupy us until the end of time, and except for the
simple basics far exceed my capacity, we shall not go further into the
intricacies of CHANGE & STABILITY Dynamics here, other than to state:

The universal Dynamics of CHANGE & STABILITY generate and govern all physical,
chemical, biological, instinctual, social, psychological, economic,
technological, political and cognitive systems.

In regard to cognitive systems: our cognitive consciousness is generated and
governed by whether a neuron - or a complex of neurons - fires (CHANGE) or not
(STABILITY). Likewise, our cumulative body of learned knowledge is generated
and governed by new knowledge (CHANGE) and long established knowledge
(STABILITY). The extremes of these bi-polar generating and governing forces
are most familiar to us as heresy and dogma.

Similarly, the ability to learn is generated and governed by cognitive CHANGE,
whereas memory is generated and governed by cognitive STABILITY. Incidentally,
the 0 and 1 foundation of our computer language is also generated by the
CHANGE & STABILITY dynamics of whether a transistor - or array of transistors
- fires or not.

The interaction of the bi-polar dynamics of CHANGE & STABILITY generates
Progressive Complexity. Matter, for instance, is a far more complex thing than
the ultimate simplicity of pure energy (is there an even simpler ur-energy, or
proto-energy, than the bi-polar energy we know? The Dynamics of Progressive
Complexity appear to imply this). The transformation of energy into matter
constitutes a cardinal and canonical quantum leap of Progressive Complexity.

Similarly, the serial fusion of elementary hydrogen into progressively more
complex elements in stars is another clear instance of the Universal Dynamics
of Progressive Complexity at work. Indeed, and in this light, every star in
the universe is a blazing factory of Progressive Complexities (our own sun is
fusing simple hydrogen into more complex helium right now - the source of our
'sunshine' - which in turn drives the Progressive Complexity of the evolution
of Life on the Earth).

The creation of the far higher complexity of matter from the ultimate
simplicity of energy shortly after the big bang birth of our universe not only
provided the physical foundation of our universe, but constitutes indisputable
proof that Progressive Complexity is inherent in the nature of energy.
Consequently, Progressive Complexity is fundamental to the nature and
structure of our universe.

The full implication are myriad, immensely powerful, and stunning. One of the
most far-reaching implications is that, rather than 'chaotic', our universe is
constructively dynamic and embodies a plan and a purpose. Growth, for instance
- from the seminal simplicity of a single fertile ovum to the immense
complexity of a fully developed organism - is indisputably a constructively
dynamic process which is accompanied, at every stage, by a geometric increase
in Progressive Complexity.

Similarly, the 'growth' of a proto-star from the elementary simplicity of a
hydrogen cloud to the far higher complexity of a new-born star, complete with
its retinue of planets and moons (we consider planet formation universal
rather than a unique local accident),  is also and clearly a constructively
dynamic process accompanied by a commensurate increase in Progressive
Complexity. Moreover, every increase in Complexity is accompanied by an
obligatory and commensurate increase in Order.

The creation and maintenance of the staggering physiological, metabolic,
neural and cognitive Complexity of a fully developed human being, for
instance, demands a degree of Order which can only be described as awesome.

Growth, hitherto purely an empirical phenomenon, here becomes, as we shall
see, the direct product of - as generated and governed by - the fundamental
dynamics of Progressive Complexity of our universe. The growth of a chicken
from an egg, or the growth of a tree from a seed, is often considered to be a
teleological process - a process which embodies a plan and a purpose. Since
nothing in this universe exists without cause, we consider the existence of
these teleological processes to be the direct expression of the fundamental
Constructively Dynamic forces, and therefore, teleological nature, of our
universe.

The evolution and existence of our kind and selves in such a universe - and as
the direct product of its fundamental dynamics of Progressive Complexity -
also endows our existence with a supreme plan and purpose and, therefore, with
profound meaning. The full implications - regarding the true nature of
our universe, as well as of our selves - are indeed stunning.

Lest this be construed as another example of extreme anthropocentricity by
some, the universal nature of these dynamics makes the existence of our kind
far from unique in this universe. The existence of similarly highly evolved
races numbering in the billions, is a given. After all, universal dynamics
apply throughout the universe. Still, and although these billions of highly
sentient races differ vastly in form, function and appearance in accord with
local conditions, we will share the nature of our consciousness with all of
them.

One of the first implications of a progressively more complex universe is that
its fundamental dynamics of Progressive Complexity also contain what may well
be called "The Equation of All Creation".

For a vivid illustration of how the Dynamics of CHANGE & STABILITY generate
Progressive Complexity, we now turn to the enchanting beauty and infinite
COMPLEXITY of the images of the Mandelbrot set. Like our universe, there is
only one Mandelbrot set, but it is infinite. (Since this format does not
support graphics, and if not familiar with 'Fractals' or the Mandelbrot set,
please refer to the many publications, such as "Chaos" by James Glick, which
feature the 'fractal' images of the Mandelbrot set, most of which are strongly
reminiscent of many complex living organisms).

The intricate and infinite Complexity of the Mandelbrot set is the product of
a very simple algorithm which, in its most basic form, is written like this:

                    Z(2)  + C = Z1

(Z squared, plus C equals Z one).  Here, Z stands for any complex number which
is squared, and C stands for any complex number which remains constant
throughout and is added to the product of Z squared. The result of this simple
calculation is termed Z one. In the next round, Z one is substituted for Z, is
then squared as before, the constant C is added again, to yield the product Z
two. Written down, the iterative procedure looks like this:

                  Z (2)  +  C  =  Z1
                 Z1 (2)  +  C  =  Z2
                 Z2 (2)  +  C  =  Z3
                 Z3 (2)  +  C  =  Z4
                 Z4 (2)  +  C  =  Z5

Since this format does not support sub and superscript this sublimely simple
iteration goes like this in words:

               Z  squared   plus C   equals   Z one
           Z one  squared   plus C   equals   Z two
           Z two  squared   plus C   equals   Z three
         Z three  squared   plus C   equals   Z four
          Z four  squared   plus C   equals   Z five

and so forth and so forth, ad inifinitum.

When the result of each iteration - Z one;  Z two; Z three - and so forth, and
so forth - is plotted as a point on a co-ordinate grid, the infinite
complexity and enchanting beauty of the Mandelbrot set's images emerges, point
by point, on the grid, or as commonly done today, on the computer screen. The
preceding image was made in this manner (although the actual Mandelbrot
algorithm is a bit more complex than this, its basic form is exactly as stated
here).

The key to the origin and dynamics of PROGRESSIVE COMPLEXITY is very simple.
As is clearly apparent in this simple algorithmic iteration, Z is a
continuously CHANGING factor, whereas the factor C remains constant, and hence
STABLE, throughout. In this manner the dynamics of CHANGE & STABILITY
generate and govern PROGRESSIVE COMPLEXITY.

The gestation and growth of biological organisms - from the seminal simplicity
of a single fertile cell to the immense Complexity of a fully developed adult
- is the most intimately familiar example of the creation of Progressive
Complexity by the dynamics of CHANGE & STABILITY.

Each stage in the gestation of an organism -

    one cell divides into two;
    two into four;
    four divide into eight;
    eight make 16;
    16 make 32;
    32 make 64;
    and so forth;

and so forth - marks an instance of CHANGE, as well as a geometric increase in
Complexity. The element of STABILITY in the growth process arises out of the
fact that each daughter cell is a perfect copy and identical 'clone' of its
maternal cell. At least initially, each daughter cell is an invariant, or a
STABLE copy of its maternal cell.

At the level of biological gestation and Growth, we are dealing with an
immensely higher level of Progressive Complexity than the CHANGE of energy
into the higher Complexity of elementary particles, or than the progressive
fusion of hydrogen into the Progressive Complexity of the elements in stars.

And while the PROGRESSIVE COMPLEXITY of the evolution of Life has introduced
profound genetically driven CHANGE into the gestation and Growth of immensely
Complex organisms, the DNA of each cell - no matter whether any cell develops
into skin, eye, brain, blood or one of a myriad other cells - remains
identical to the maternal DNA of the original fertile ovum, and thus, embodies
the genetic and morphological STABILITY of the organism. Basic cell structure,
mitochondria (with their own genetic and morphological STABILITY factors),
Golgi aparati, ribosomes, endoplasmic reticula, lysosomes, nucleoli,
centrioles, microtubules etc., down to the various chemical, molecular and
atomic STABILITIES, are other examples of the manifold and intricate web of
biological STABILITY factors. Also see the 4 billion year-long morphological
STABILITY of bacteria - despite the massive CHANGES to an aerobic atmosphere
and the intervention of dozens of ice ages.

The universal Dynamics of Progressive Complexity from energy to our kind and
selves are best illustrated by this simple diagram:

                     E  N  E  R  G  Y

                STRATA  of Progressive Complexity

Although this is a very simple and familiar diagram (see a very similar
diagram in the textbook "Biology", The Unity And Diversity Of Life; Third
Edition, Starr & Staggart, Wadsworth Publishing Co. 1984, page6) it contains
many profound insights.  The first and most obvious is the fact that the
structure and evolution of the universe and life alike is a pure matter of
Progressive Complexity. And we now know how this works. Besides a radical and
fundamental revision of our traditional perceptions regarding the nature of
our universe, this insight demystifies the emergence of Life and makes is a
pure matter of Progressive Complexity - as well a universal phenomenon. As
Carl Sagan put it: "Life is as common in the universe as sand on a
beach." Another insight is that the Progressive Complexity of the evolution of
the universe and of Life is an unbroken continuum from energy to our kind and
selves. To whit, our personal substance is composed of the elements of the
universe, and we are animated - body and mind - by the energy of the universe.

This insight has several powerful consequences. First and foremost, we are
creatures of the universe - and far more so than we are creatures of the
Earth. Since this insight will radically and fundamentally revise our
perception of our selves from earthy creatures to bona fide cosmic beings, a
little more detail is in order here.

For most people the big bang birth of our universe is, if of any interest at
all, an extremely remote and purely esoteric concept which has no bearing
whatsoever on their reality. They could not be any more wrong. To whit; at the
atomic level our personal substance is composed of protons, electrons and
neutrinos (neutrons are also made up of protons and electrons, plus
neutrinos). And protons and electrons condensed out of the pure energy of  the
big bang birth of our universe within split nano-seconds of the big bang. We
are, in fact, the living, walking, talking, loving, laughing and crying
embodiment of the big bang energy of our universe.

There is no way around this; Moreover, the alpha, beta and delta waves of our
brains are the driving force of every thought, word and deed as long as we
live. And this, our life energy, is the direct product of the big bang birth
of our universe. The other elements which make up our personal substance were
created in stars - now long dead and gone - and also from the big bang
hydrogen of the universe.

We are indeed - first, foremost and fundamentally - cosmic beings.  So is your
wife, your husband, your children, your family, friends and neighbours, indeed
the whole teeming shebang of our kind, including what you may perceive as your
enemies. And lest we begin to jubilate overmuch over our new-found cosmic
identity, the same holds true of cabbages, among all other things. However,
there is an important difference; cabbages do not know anything about all
this.

The unbroken continuum from the primeval energy of our universe to our kind
and selves yields another profound insight - an insight which contains the
pivotal difference whether we destroy our planetary biosphere, or not.

As any child who has ever played with blocks full well knows, if it removes
one block from a tower of blocks, all the blocks above that block come
tumbling down. Going back to our diagram of the Progressive Complexity from
energy to our kind, and let's say it were possible to eliminate the section
comprising Atomic Particles - all the other levels above Atomic Particles
would disappear. This is simple, straightforward and inexorable logic.

Well, as it turns out, we are doing exactly the same thing. We are eliminating
the plant life of the continents at an alarming rate, and on all fronts. The
inescapable consequence will be that our planetary biosphere will collapse,
and will do so within our time. However, there is still an, albeit rapidly
shrinking, window of opportunity while the dynamics now well underway can
still be reversed. But we do not have much time left. For a more detailed
description of the manifold factors involved see "A Vibrant Biosphere", also
by this writer.

Returning once more to our diagram of Progressive Complexity, we also find
that there are major STRATA of COMPLEXITY within the hierarchy of Progressive
Complexity from energy to our kind. These STRATA of COMPLEXITY arise directly
from, and are closely akin to the STRATA of STABILITY inherent in the Dynamics
of CHANGE & STABILITY which we have skipped in the context of this format.

Significantly, and true to form, each STRATUM of PROGRESSIVE COMPLEXITY
contains its own SUB-STRATA of  PROGRESSIVE COMPLEXITY. For instance, the
major STRATUM of the Elements encompasses the Progressive Complexity from
hydrogen (the simplest element) to uranium (the most complex of the natural
elements) - each with their own typical and intrinsic STRATUM of STABILITY.
Indeed, "The Periodic Table of the Elements" is a beautifully formal and
precisely quantified map of the Progressive Complexity of the elements, as
well as of their various, typical and intrinsic STRATA of STABILITY.

Similarly, the STRATUM of Plants encompasses the Progressive Complexity from
the most primitive single cells (algae) to the most complex members of the
Plant kingdom (sexually differentiated trees and shrubs, such as the Holly
tree and Skimmia).

So far then, we have uncovered an unbroken continuum and absolutely coherent
formal structure - both internally (the dynamics) and externally (the Cosmos)
- of the creative and governing forces of the Cosmos and of Life alike, as
they arise out of the fundamental nature of energy and its intrinsic dynamics
of CHANGE & STABILITY and PROGRESSIVE COMPLEXITY.

We have also come to understand that the PROGRESSIVE COMPLEXITY of physical
and biological Growth is a constructively dynamic process, and hence, that we
are a product of, and owe our existence to a Constructively Dynamic universe.

Due to the universal nature of these fundamental dynamics, we have also
obtained the fundamental creative and governing forces of our biosphere. Given
the understanding of these forces and dynamics, we are now able to address and
rectify the rapid deterioration of our planetary biosphere effectively and in
short order - we can now engage the immense power of these forces in our
favour - if we can muster the collective will to do so. Within the context of
these fundamental universal forces, it now turns out that our current and
escalating health crisis, our poison-drenched and unsustainable agriculture,
and the rapid deterioration of our planetary biosphere are all the direct
result of our ignorance and REDUCTION of the Progressive Complexity of our
existence, agriculture and biosphere. Given these fundamental creative forces
of our universe, these crises can be easily and quickly corrected; see "A
Stable and Vibrant Biosphere", also "An Abundant and Poison-free agriculture",
and "Supreme Health", all by this author.

Along the way, we have also obtained a completely new process for the
evolution of Life; a universal process which generates and governs the
evolution of the universe and Life alike and is articulated by the universal
dynamics of CHANGE & STABILITY and PROGRESSIVE COMPLEXITY. Other than common
descent - and this now includes the universal elements we are made of and the
universal energy which animates us body and mind - nothing is left of
Darwinian or Neo-Darwinian notions. (see "A Formal and Universal Process of
Evolution", by this author).

Since our universe is fundamentally bi-polar in nature (the ultimate origin of
gender, by the way) the constructive dynamics of our universe are balanced,
with exquisite precision, by the reductive dynamics of our universe - by the
dynamics of Progressive Simplicity, or Decay, and death. In this context,
the phenomenon of birth, and thus of Life, becomes the polar expression of the
fundamental complementary polarities of our universe, and the reigning
scientific dogma of entropy - the dissipation of energy - can now be
understood as just one half of the whole equation of the creative dynamics of
our universe.

Indeed, Paul Davies recognised the obvious when he stated: "So there exists
something like a law of increasing complexity." ("The Cosmic Blueprint", 1988,
page 21).

Indeed, Prigogine has mused that, "all that dissipated energy (the exclusive
focus in current science) must be good for something."  As indeed it is. One
example, and close to home, is the immense amount of energy which is
dissipated by our sun in the process of fusing the elementary simplicity of
hydrogen into the higher Complexity of helium.

We know this dissipated energy as sunshine, and while by far most of it is
dissipated into space, the fraction which arrives here on the Earth is the
generating and driving force of all Life on Earth, of our planetary biosphere,
and of the PROGRESSIVE COMPLEXITY of the evolution of Life. Thus, our sun is
the driving engine of a double-whammy creation of PROGRESSIVE COMPLEXITIES -
the Progressive Complexity of the elements in the sun, and the Progressive
Complexity of Life on the Earth.

On an immensely larger scale, the dissipated energy and matter in galaxies is
condensed into new stars and planets in an eternal cycle of dissipation and
concentration; and on a higher order of magnitude, black holes complement
these bi-polar creative dynamics of our universe by concentrating the matter
and energy of galaxies - down to the last lonely photon - and then dissipating
it again in highly concentrated and extremely potent form. The dynamics of
black holes and their function - literally 'cosmic vacuum cleaners' and re-
cyclers - arise out of the Dynamics of CHANGE & STABILITY which we have
omitted here for brevity. In this light, the big bang birth of our universe
may well be the product of "The Mother of all Black Holes", to use a
paraphrase of a recently popular oxymoron.

We have now come to the point of laying to rest the most serious challenge to
all of the foregoing; the 2nd law of thermodynamics as it stands today.
Although the 2nd law has been re-worded many times (entropy always increases
is the favoured form today), its previous form and fundamental concept stated
that any activity (work) in this universe is accompanied by the dissipation of
some energy - hence, entropy always increases.

This is true. My cup of tea does grow colder the longer it sits undrunk
besides me, and just by living, never mind working, I dissipate a lot of
energy into the environment. There is no way around this, the second law is
absolute in this regard, and governs the universe as a whole. This means that,
if only eventually, the universe must run down to a uniform tepid state where
nothing can happen ever again, due to the lack of any energy differential.
This is called the 'heat-death' of the universe. Essentially then, the
marvellous and near-infinite Complexities of the universe - things like
galaxies and our selves, among a small infinity of other intricate
Complexities - are counter to the 2nd law and are, at best, temporary and
'astronomically unlikely accidents' in a chaotic universe. This is the
reigning dogma of today's science.

Since the 1st law has proven so infinitely fecund, we now return to the 1st
law of thermodynamics to see what it may contain in this regard. As we have
seen, it contains, and explicitly so, the complementary polarity of CHANGE &
STABILITY.  And encouraged to the point of certainty by a myriad other
fundamental and well known complementary polarities of our universe, we now
accept the concept of complementary polarity as a fundamental principle of our
universe.

With the universal principle of Complementary Polarity firmly in hand, we now
approach the 2nd law to see what we may find. The second law states that, 'any
work is accompanied by the dissipation of some energy'. Extending the
principle of Complementarity Polarity to the 2nd law, the most obvious
conclusion is that there should also be something which concentrates energy.

And, indeed, there is. Gravity concentrates energy and matter into such things
as stars, planets and black holes. There is also another force which
concentrates energy and matter; opposite charge of the particles also
concentrates energy and matter. And although some energy is dissipated in
this process - as the emission of a photon when an electron is attracted to a
closer orbital to the nucleus - the net effect is a spacial concentration of
the combined energy and mass of the electron and proton. The same holds true
within the domains of the weak and strong forces. It now turns out that the
traditional 2nd law, while absolutely correct as far as it went, was just too
short; to short by half, in fact.

We can now attempt the first approximation of the complete, or new and
improved, version of the 2nd law of thermodynamics.

     In the form of gravity, mass and opposite charge, energy seeks its
     highest available state and attracts and concentrates energy and
     matter.

     In all other forms, energy seeks its lowest available state and
     emits and dissipates energy and matter.

     The attractive and emissive forces inherent in the bi-polar
     nature of energy co-exist simultaneously, are relative to each
     other, are inversely proportional and are simultaneously superposed
     upon each other.

And while this wording will undoubtedly be changed and refined several times
over, the attractive and emissive forces inherent in the nature of energy are
as indisputable as stars, planets, moons, galaxies, black holes, atomic and
molecular structure, the earth under our feet and the fact that we do not
float away gracefully into the universe at large.

Stars in particular, are brilliantly beautiful examples of the attractive and
emissive polar complements of energy at work. (The emissive and attractive
forces of energy have been formalised by a 17th or 18th century mathematician,
but my reference has disappeared).

With this, we now obtain a universe which is eternally dynamic and capable of
creating  infinite cycles of Progressive Complexities, including Life and
highly evolved cognitive consciousness, according to a supreme plan and
purpose articulated by fundamental forces which operate with exquisite
precision, selectivity and Order on all scales from the cosmic to the sub-
nuclear.

As the direct product of such a universe, our existence is endowed with an
equally supreme plan and purpose. This brief synopsis is only a minuscule
glimpse of the mind-boggling splendour of the nature of our universe, and the
true and natural context of our existence as the direct offspring of the
creative forces of such a universe.

We close with this conceptual diagram of how everything that we are, do and
know arises out of the complementary polarities of the creative forces of our
universe - with the caution that the polarities shown here are inseparable,
and far from the clear-cut separation as indicated here.
