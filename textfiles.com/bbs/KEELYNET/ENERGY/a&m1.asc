               Texas A & M regents briefed on controversial research
                    Probe of mercury-into-gold effort outlined
                                  by Olive Talley

       College Station, Texas  - The Texas A&M Board of Regents was briefed
       Wednesday about university investigations of a $200,000 donation for
       research into a process that purported to turn mercury into gold.

       Chancellor William Mobley acknowledged being aware in September 1992
       of a federal  subpoena  to  the  university's   development   office
       concerning the donation.   But Mr. Mobley, who was  then  Texas  A&M
       president, said he  did not believe at the time that the inquiry had
       anything to do with A&M.

       The donation for what donor William  Telander  of  California called
       THE PHILADELPHIA PROJECT   came  to  the  university's   development
       foundation in March 1992.

       In March 1993,  the  Securities  and  Exchange Commission filed suit
       against Mr. Telander,  accusing   him   of   running   a  fraudulent
       international currency exchance scheme.  No charges have been filed.

       Interim president E. Dean Gage told the board about  the  review  he
       had set in  motion:  a  board  of inquiry to investigate allegations
       that the researcher, Dr. John O'M  Bockris, was guilty of scientific
       misconduct, and a second board to determine whether  the  university
       followed proper procedures concerning the donation and the research.

       "We believe everything was followed according to what we should have
       done, but we  want to make certain in the future that we protect the
       public, the university and our faculty members," Dr. Cage said.  Dr.
       Bockris has denied any wrongdoing.

       Several board members expressed dismay  that  they had learned about
       the potential problems  associated with the project  from  the  news
       media and not  from  the  university.   Regent  Billy  Clayton asked
       whether Mr. Telander had misused A&M's  name, and Dr. Cage said that
       would be investigated.

       The board inquiring into Dr. Bockris' actions has 60 working days to
       produce a report.  The board reviewing university policies regarding
       this and other  donations is due to make a preliminary  report  next
       month.
