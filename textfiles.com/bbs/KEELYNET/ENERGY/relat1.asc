       Title->     A challenge   to   Einstein.   (challenges   to   Albert
                   Einstein's special theory of relativity) (special issue:
                   35th Anniversary 1955-1990)

       Authors->   Bethell, Tom

       HOWARD HAYDEN, a  professor  of   physics   at   the  University  of
       Connecticut since 1967, is in the final stages of an experiment that
       may undermine a  basic  assumption of Einstein's special  theory  of
       relativity: that the  speed  of light is a constant, irrespective of
       the observer's motion.

       Hayden claims that the invariant  velocity  of  light has never been
       demonstrated experimentally, and to dramatize this  startling claim,
       he and Petr  Beckmann,  Professor Emeritus of electrical engineering
       at the University of Colorado, are  jointly  offering  a  reward  of
       $2,000 to anyone   who   can   cite   a  valid  optical   experiment
       demonstrating that the  speed  of  light east to west on the Earth's
       surface is the same as it is west  to  east (to an accuracy of fifty
       meters per second). The experiment does not have  to  be  performed,
       merely cited.

       A longtime skeptic  about  relativity,  Beckmann  a  few  years  ago
       proposed a rival theory of physics  which, he claims, fits the known
       facts and explains  them  much  more simply than Einstein's.  Before
       publishing his theory  in  a  book (Einstein Plus Two, 1987) he sent
       the manuscript to Howard Hayden at  Storrs,  Connecticut.   Hayden's
       initial reaction was near-disbelief that the velocity  of  light had
       not already been  demonstrated  to  be  invariant. But eventually he
       became convinced that Beckmann was right.

       In 1988, he devised an experimental  test  of Beckmann's theory. His
       preliminary results support  Beckmann, raising the question  whether
       there are any  experimental  observations  which  require relativity
       theory to explain them.

       Toward the end of the nineteenth century, the evidence that light
       travels in a wave became overwhelming.  Just as sound waves need air
       to travel in, so light would need a medium, if it traveled in waves.
       This hypothetical medium  was  called  the  ether,   and   a  famous
       experiment by Michelson and Morley, performed in Cleveland in 1887,

                                      Page 1





       was expected to  demonstrate  its existence. Since the Earth must be
       passing through this ether on its  journey  around the sun, everyone
       assumed it would  be  possible  to  detect the ether  wind"  with  a
       suitable apparatus, just  as it is possible to detect the air from a
       moving car by putting your hand out  into  the breeze.  In the 1880s
       Michelson devised an  experiment  sensitive enough,  in  theory,  to
       produce a measurable effect.

       But no matter how many times they tried, Michelson and Morley could
       detect no ethereal  breeze.  (In  their  experiment,  this  had been
       expected to take the form of a shift  in  the  interference  pattern
       visible where criss-crossing light rays came together.)

       Various explanations for the null result were suggested. Michelson
       himself supposed that the ether was "entrained,"  which  is  to  say
       carried along with  the Earth. As we shall see, this may have been a
       close approximation to the truth. But the entrained-ether theory was
       rejected by most scientists.

       The physicists G. F. FitzGerald and  H. A. Lorentz suggested another
       possibility: that moving objects contract slightly  in the direction
       of motion-the contraction  being  just sufficient to account for the
       null result. This was ingenious, but unsatisfactory.

       It had the ad-hoc look of an unfalsifiable  assumption,  rather like
       the suggestion that everything in the universe is getting  bigger at
       the same time.

       Then in 1905,   in   his  special  theory  of  relativity,  Einstein
       suggested a third way of looking at the matter. He proposed

              a)   that the speed of light  is  the same in all directions,
                   irrespective of the motion of any apparatus  set  up  to
                   measure it; and

              b)   that observers traveling with different velocities would
                   see the   same   things   with   different  lengths  and
                   durations.

       This eliminated the need for an ether altogether.

       Einstein's famous paper showed that  everything  could be worked out
       mathematically if these peculiar assumptions about the universe were
       made.

       This was a  very odd procedure.  Einstein bent" space  and  time  so
       that a velocity  could  be  preserved  as  a  constant. But velocity
       itself is merely distance divided by time.

       Discarding space and time as "absolutes"  so  that a velocity can be
       retained as an absolute is as strange as it would be for a man to go
       on living undisturbed  on the second floor of his  house  while  the
       basement and ground floor were completely remodeled.

       Einstein's assumption about  the invariant velocity of light emerged
       from the turn-of-the-century  quandary   of   physicists  trying  to
       account for the Michelson-Morley result. But if it  turns  out  that
       there is a  simpler  way  of  explaining  what  really  happened, we
       should, out of deference to the simplicity that is preferred by

                                      Page 2





       science, discard the premise that the speed of light is invariant.

       We should (everything else being equal) prefer the notion that light
       behaves like other  wave phenomena (such as sound). This would allow
       us to bring back space and time as  absolutes.   And  it would, to a
       large extent, restore the classical world view of Isaac Newton.

       What, then, is Beckmann's theory, and does it indeed achieve such a
       degree of simplification?

       Beckmann argues that the medium through which light waves travel (or
       more generally, electromagnetic  waves)  is  not  a  universal,  all
       pervasive, uniform substance-the  ether-but  more  simply  the local
       gravitational field.

       For us, the local" gravitational field is overwhelmingly that of the
       Earth. And this field moves forward  with  the  Earth on its journey
       around the sun.  The  null  result  obtained by Michelson-Morley  is
       therefore easily explained  because  there  was  no  "ether wind" to
       measure.

       Analogously, someone in the bathroom  of  a  Boeing  747  would  not
       expect to feel a slipstream if he stuck his head out  into  the main
       cabin. The air in the main cabin is moving along with him.

       Plot Twist

       AT THIS POINT Beckmann adds a plot twist-almost literally. The Earth
       is also rotating  on  its  axis  every  24 hours, and there are good
       reasons for believing that the Earth  really  does rotate within its
       gravitational field; that is, that this field does  not twist around
       with the Earth.   Beckmann  illustrates  this  key  point  with  the
       following analogy:

              Imagine a woman wearing a hoop  skirt  fitting loosely around
              her waist.

              As she moves forward, the skirt moves with her  and  there is
              no relative motion between her and the skirt. But if she then
              pirouettes, or  does  the  twist, while still moving forward,
              she would rotate" within the skirt.

              At that point relative motion between her body and the skirt
              would be detectable.

       The Earth moves forward around the sun at about sixty thousand miles
       per hour; but it rotates on its axis  (in  the latitude of New York)
       at only about six hundred mph.

       If Beckmann is  right,  therefore,  the detectable  relative  motion
       between the rotating Earth and its gravitational field is only about
       one-hundredth of what Michelson and Morley were looking for.

       But the relevant  equation  requires  that this fraction be squared,
       and so the expected "fringe shift"  is  only  one  ten-thousandth of
       what they expected to find. This was beyond the technical  limits of
       measuring instruments in the 1880s. But today it can be measured.

       Readers at this point may well be imagining that Howard Hayden has

                                      Page 3





       simply redone Michelson-Morley,   looking   for  this  much  smaller
       effect. In fact, such an experiment  would  be  very  expensive  for
       someone without the necessary equipment.

       Instead, Hayden has repeated another old experiment, first performed
       at Cambridge in  1903 by Trouton and Noble; an experiment  sometimes
       called the electromagnetic equivalent of Michelson-Morley.

       It cannot easily   be   explained,  but  it  involves  suspending  a
       capacitor from a very thin copper  wire,  the  whole apparatus being
       carefully protected in a vacuum and shielded from stray currents and
       magnetic influences.

       If the Earth's  surface is, as claimed, moving through  the  Earth's
       gravitational field west  to  east  at  six hundred mph, and if this
       field really is the medium in which  electromagnetic  waves  travel,
       the suspended capacitor should experience a torque,  slowly twisting
       in the "ether wind" until the capacitor is aligned north-south.

       If, on the  other  hand,  Einstein  is  right,  and  the velocity of
       electromagnetic waves is an absolute regardless of the gravitational
       field, there should be no torque.

       HAYDEN HAS DETECTED A TORQUE, as Beckmann predicted.

       Four additional points should be borne in mind:

       Einstein's famous equation, E = MC.sq.2, expressing the relationship
       between mass and energy, is unaffected  by  all this. It was derived
       independently of relativity     theory    (some    textbooks     and
       popularizations to the   contrary   notwithstanding)  and  would  be
       unaffected by its demise.

       "The most famous experimental test  of  Einstein  occurred  in 1919,
       when an expedition photographed a solar eclipse off  West Africa and
       confirmed the truth  of  a new theory of the universe," according to
       the opening page of Paul Johnson's Modern Times.

       Light rays from a star bent slightly,  as  predicted, as they passed
       close by the  sun.  But according to Beckmann and Hayden,  this  can
       easily be explained  without  relativity.   Light  rays do bend when
       they pass through a medium of varying density; they bend sharply, as
       anyone can see by looking at a pencil  in  a  glass  of  water, when
       passing from one medium to another.

       Likewise, but to a much smaller extent, light rays  passing from the
       rarefied medium of   gravity   in   outer   space  into  the  denser
       gravitational field nearer the sun should be expected to bend.

       Classical physics (Fermat's  Law)   is  sufficient  to  explain  it;
       Einsteinian complexity, such as curved space is not needed.

               (Fermat's Law states that light en route from A to B
               follows the path that minimizes the time of transit.)

       Another much-heralded confirmation   of  Einstein   is   the   small
       discrepancy between the advance of Mercury's perihelion (the orbital
       point closest to the sun) and the result predicted by Newton.

       "Einstein's theory accounted  exactly  for  this  residue," Bertrand
       Russell wrote in The ABC of Relativity. Beckmann is astounded by the
       rewriting of history here.

       Einstein's formula explaining Mercury's orbit, published in 1915 and
       derived from general relativity theory,  had  in fact been published
       17 years earlier  by a man named Paul Gerber (Beckmann  believes  he
       was a high-school teacher in Stargard, Germany).

       Gerber used classical  physics,  plus the assumption that gravity is
       not instantaneous (as Newton thought)  but propagates with the speed
       of light (as  is now generally accepted). Gerber derived  Einstein's
       equation exactly, without  relativity.  Einstein arrived at the same
       point using a  complex  trick-bag   of   gravitational  tensors  and
       Riemannian geometry.

       The protocols of science recommend that simpler explanations  should
       be preferred to complex ones, but Gerber has been ignored.

       Albert Michelson, the  first  American  to  win  the  Nobel Prize in
       physics, never accepted the theory  of  relativity.  (Nor  did H. A.
       Lorentz.) Michelson believed that the ether he failed  to detect was
       entrained by the Earth in its orbit, but NOT IN ITS ROTATION.

       In 1925 he  checked  this  theory,  so  similar to Beckmann's, in an
       elaborate optical experiment at Clearing, Illinois, with a colleague
       at the University of Chicago, H.  G.  Gale.  They  did indeed find a
       fringe shift, which Einstein had to explain by a highly  complicated
       application of general  relativity  theory. But by then Einstein was
       well on his way to deification, and  today  Michelson/Gale is rarely
       mentioned.

       What is now  needed  is a rerun of the Michelson-Morley  experiment,
       with the Beckmann  theory put to the test. The famous experiment was
       repeated by physicists at the University  of  Colorado in 1979, on a
       rotating table and using laser light. Unexpected perturbations  were
       detected, but attributed to other causes.

       One of the  experimenters,  Dr. John L.  Hall of the Joint Institute
       for Laboratory Astrophysics,  a  leading  expert  on  speed-of-light
       experiments, says that Beckmann "has made a serious effort to reduce
       relativity thinking to   an   objective   environment,    in   which
       measurements can be  made  and  his  theory put to the test." He has
       suggested that Michelson-Morley should be repeated on an orbiting
       satellite.

       The experiment would be crucial because, if Beckmann is correct, the
       much greater velocity with which  a  satellite  passes  through  the
       Earth's gravitational field (a satellite's "day" is  ninety minutes)
       would increase by  a  factor  of  four hundred the fringe shift that
       Beckmann would expect to find.

       "Such an experiment would not prove  that  Beckmann  is right," Hall
       added, but it sure could prove that he is wrong." By the same token,
       it could also  prove that Einstein is wrong. Let's  hope  that  Hall
       gets the opportunity to do the experiment.
