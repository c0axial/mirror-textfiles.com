                          Electricity out of thin air
            One person's research which supports the MRA hypothesis
                       by Richard A. Edwards - Australia

Several decades ago a man took a bucketful of ilmenite, or similar, melted and
compressed it into a solid block of monocrystal siliconand and sliced the
block into wafers.  The wafers were square.  Today they are square, round or
any desired shape. Recent breakthroughs in solar-electric technology have even
allowed the  silicon to be completely flexible.

On his workbench he placed a stack of the wafers and a sheet of glass (today,
plastic is more commonly used).  On each wafer he glued an aluminium
conducting grid, leaving a trail north and south.  He turned each wafer over,
gluing them on the glass so that the conducting grid was between the glass and
the wafers in, say, rows of six.

He solder-connected all the north tails to the south tails, making a
continuous conducting grid.  Over the lot he glued a laminate to weatherproof
it and hold it all together.  On one of the remaining two tails he connected a
diode to give (polarized) directed flow.  He took the assembled panel out into
the sunlight.  He turned it over so that the glass was nearest the light, then
the conducting grid, then the silicon.

He connected the two tails to a battery and two meters - one to measure
voltage, the other to measure amperage.  The meters began to register a flow
of electricity.  His theory was no longer a theory.  Thus was born solar-to-
electric conversion of energy, used and known throughout the world today as
the photovoltaic effect.

You can see the evolution of the process on site and for sale in shops all
around you today.

PHOTOVOLTAIC EFFECT

At its birth the photovoltaic man-made effect was hailed as the saviour of
mankind.  Limitless energy to herald a utopian future?  No. It slowly and
painfully became clear that this new energy source was far too meagre and had
very limited application, though some diehards still doggedly assure the
public that it is the energy source of the future.

I have spent some ten years researching and developing my concept of the
energy source of the future.  I offer it herewith.  The photovoltaic effect
described above is man imitating and greatly improving upon nature.

I firmly believe that man cannot do anything in the realm of physics if nature
has not already done it. He just does it better mostly, and occasionally
worse.  That photovoltaic effect happens all over the world wherever and
whenever the Sun shines.  All the surface of the Earth that is not biological
(alive or dead), water or mineral; is silicon - all the rock of the Earth,
from mountains to hills, boulders to rocks, stones to pebbles, from sand to
dust.

All that silicon, plus most minerals, contribute free electrons into the air
by the Sun's photovoltaic effect, in much less per-area quantity than the
concentration in a man-made panel but in an immensely larger world-sized
conglomerate.

My concept was and still is simplicity itself. We have to learn how to harvest
those free electrons that fill the air all around us.  Before I start
experimenting with hardware, I had to think it fully through.  That took me
several years.  Here is that Big Think in summary.

That infinite source of free electrons must be the major source of natural
electricity on Earth, from its obvious manifestation in lightning to its
unseeable but measurable vastness in the ionosphere.  I do not wish to lock
horns with scientists who might hold an image of the ionosphere's shape and
structure different from mine.

I will just report my hardware observations and inescapable conclusions -
not necessarily in that order.  The ionosphere and the weather system together
constitute to the Earth what storage is in a man-made battery.  The charging
is infinite.  Literally infinite.  The Sun shines on the Earth.  The natural
photovoltaic effect produces limitless, probably immeasurable amounts of free
electrons.

Those free electrons - ions if you like, same thing - cannot travel of their
own volition.  They are subject to gravity, any local electromagnetic
phenomenon, wind, and most importantly, the Earth's rotation.

The Earth rotates, taking the day's makings into the night side.  The effect
at night of the ionosphere - it's very presence, even - is well-documented and
gratingly evident to receivers of any EMF wave, particularly in AM mode.  That
is the primary storage we are after, plus its storage in the weather system.

We can, according to my big think, take out more of that electricity than we
can ever use, without in any way upsetting the balance of nature. The shape of
the ionosphere, as my hardware experiments mapped it and so will yours, can
only be more or less like a surfer's wet hair - long and trailing at the back.
The dawn side.

If it weren't trailing - the excess being drawn off by gravity into the Sun -
the electrical charge on Earth would just keep building and life as we know it
could never have begun on Earth.  In a nutshell, the solar system is a dynamo
powered by the Sun.  The Earth is an electricity storage battery.  All we have
to do to give ourselves Energy Utopia is to cream off as much of that
electricity as we care to take before it trails off into the Sun.

That finished my Big Think.  Righto.  Anybody can theorise about anything.
Hardware is what counts. So I began the  practical  bit.  It has taken me four
years and I have gone as far as I can go.  Here is the summary.

THE HARDWARE

First I needed an upside-down, naked photovoltaic panel. The silicon and
conducting grid had to be in unimpeded, open contact with the air.  The normal
method of manufacture described above only harvests the tiny amount of
electrons freed within.   According to my big think, a naked upside-down job
would harvest not only that tiny amount but also the free electrons naturally
filling the air. Okay.

Whipped around the solar shops and factories in my home town, Perth and Sydney
to find someone to make it. Didn't have to. Found one ready to roll - BP Solar
Supplies sell it. It's the size of an A5 page.  The model number is GM684-
SP60-12v.  It is not a BP product. It states "Made in Hong Kong" - nothing
else. Shy manufacturer.

Not to worry. BP Solar Supplies sell it, their shops are all around Australia.
The panel cost AUD $49 full retail. I will be quoting costs from now on
because the whole idea of this report is for you to take up where I left off.

The total cost is tiny. I am not pursuing any intellectual property protection
of any kind. I believe I might, just might, have discovered Energy Utopia. I
further believe that my discoveries must be worked up and brought on line as
quickly as possible as the world is in imminent danger of suffocating in a
poisonous cloud of environmental filth spewed from our vehicle exhausts and
factory chimneys.

Any and all of you - backyard enthusiasts, R&D scientists, schoolchildren and
their teachers  - can circumvent that.  Anybody.  Anywhere.  Except me. I
cannot - you can.  Help yourself. Don't do as I say - do as I did.

The panel: you can see at a glance how to strip it naked.

Unscrew the plastic case.
Cut the binding glue off all the edges.
Slide the panel out.
Slip a Stanley or similar knife blade under a corner of the laminate, lifting
an edge.
Peel the laminate off, just a bit harder than peeling an onion.

That's all there is to it. There is no other panel known to me with which you
can do that.  All larger models are made as described above - impossible to
separate the plastic from the works.  All the smaller models I have seen are
lacquered, not laminated, and equally useless for our purpose.

I am now going to report my discoveries with hardware during the past four
years.  Except for the panel, your equipment will possibly be different from
mine, and your environment fluctuation certainly will be.  You can form your
own theoretical conclusions.

Have your own bit of a think. I will not be referring to my big think again,
except to state now that during it I theorised that the Earth's magnetic
field might play a major role; perhaps the electricity harvest can be
accelerated.  I was to be proven right.

In my backyard patio I set to work.  The patio was ideal, being open on three
sides.  Full free-flow air contact.  From Dick Smith's I bought a digital
multimeter, model number Q-1420.  You can pick it out on the shelf easily.
It's bright yellow.  It will be helpful for you to get one of that model
yourself. It's very cheap - only AUD $29. More importantly it is dual purpose,
unlike all other multimeters that I have seen.  You only have to twiddle the
dial to switch between amps and volts.  You don't have to unplug, replug,
disconnect, reconnect or worry about series or parallel.

Give analog meters a miss.  A needle is nowhere near as clear as LCD numbers.
I place the naked panel, the multimeter and a 12 volt battery on a table and
connected them in simple series. Note: your battery must be in good condition
but never full or you will have nowhere for the electricity to go, and
therefore amps won't register on the meter.

(we have been informed by Sonne Ward, that the Optima batteries can be used as
extremely high density capacitors to accumulate high voltage spikes to
appreciable powers because of the capacitor like construction, check out Bruce

It's exactly the same as when you turn on a hot water tap in your house. Water
runs out of the tank.  Water runs into the tank, registering on your front
yard meter, and water runs out of the dam miles away.

The only difference in this case is that the dam is not miles away.  We are
surrounded by it - a vast ocean of electricity in which the Earth continually
floats.  Being aware that any light, natural or artificial, produces the
photovoltaic effect, I decided to use a flourescent tube as the light source.

It is well documented that flourescence is better than incandescence - your
every day light bulb  -  for the former is a diffuse light source, while the
latter is focal.   For about AUD $20 I bought one of those standard 12 volt
car trouble lights available in auto accessories shops, service stations and
variety stores everywhere.

I removed the plastic lid (it just clips off), turned the light upside down
and positioned it over the panel, setting it permanently in position simply by
resting it on a cigarette packet-sized bit of wood each end. The light would
now bathe the naked panel.  I connected the light to the battery in a
different, separate circuit.

TAPPING THE EARTH'S FREE ELECTRICITY

Now, the Earth's magnetic field. From Tandy's I had bought a roll of aluminium
conducting ribbon as used in window burglar alarms. It cost about AUD$7.
Around the cardboard packet the solar panel came in, I wound some of the
ribbon, securing it here and there with sticky tape, to make a flat coil.

To each end of the ribbon I connected about three metres of plastic-covered
wire flex.  We will come back to that shortly. I connected the flat coil
between the naked panel and the multimeter.

Is that all clear to you?  A simple series.

Battery to naked panel to flat coil to multimeter to battery.  Flourescent
light source in a separate circuit.  Diagrams are not necessary.  Once you
have the hardware in front of you, it will become stunningly simple.

All systems go.  At about 3.00 pm one afternoon three years ago I setup the
rig.  My wife, our four kids and I, feeling pretty silly, sat to wait and  see
what, if anything, would happen.

The volts read about 2 volts. The amps read about 2 milliamps. Nothing by 4.00
pm.  Still the same. I put on a pair of insulating washing-up gloves to make
sure the electricity in my body would not be a factor. I picked up the flat
coil. I moved it about in all planes.

Up. Down, Sideways. Twist. WOW!  Volts and amps rose and dived all over the
place. I satisfied myself that I had found the highest orientation reading  -
about 3.5 volts and about 5 milliamps - then propped the coil permanently in
that position on the table simply by jamming it between books.

The sun set about 7.00 pm. About 8.00 pm, volts and amps began to rise. By
9.00 pm they had reached about 5 volts and 10 milliamps. They stayed there
until about an hour before dawn.  Then they dropped back to 3 volts and 5
milliamps.

My family and I were stunned. Far better than I had dreamed!  Many nights of
monitoring and analysing have since revealed various times of increase.
Sometimes before sunset, sometimes hours after.  My house is near the ocean.
Sometimes the wind would be offshore, sometimes onshore. You can form your own
conclusions. I have formed mine.

On rare occasions a strange thing happened.  During crystal-clear weather, day
or night but much more noticeable at night, the volts and amps would swiftly
fall, staying down for varying periods from a few minutes up to an hour or so,
then swiftly rise again.  There was no tangible variable in the environment.

My family and I were most perplexed.  One midnight the volts and amps were at
the lowest reading we had seen at any time of day or night.  That was when I
noticed the Moon was full and directly overhead. I have formed my conclusions.
You can form yours.

But the party had not yet warmed up. The summer electrical storm season was
due to begin.  That's what I wanted to see.  During the ensuing two years of
monitoring and analysing, we had many electrical storms.  This is briefly
what happened.

When rain fell, day or night, volts and amps immediately leapt, sometimes
trebling from whatever they were reading, and stayed up until at least ten
minutes after the rain had stopped. When a nearby lightning flash occurred,
volts and amps went too high and fluctuated so wildly that it was and still is
difficult to comprehend the enormity of what we were seeing.

But the party had still not yet got hot. So far the hardware was only
stationary. What would happen if it were moving?  Would it harvest more free
electrons like a baleen whale harvests plankton while cruising through the
ocean with its mouth open?  Let's find out.

I rang an energy management consultancy in Perth which I selected from the
yellow pages on the basis that it was in the CBD, thus accessible to me by
public transport. I am a virtually penniless invalid pensioner so I have to do
everything in the cheapest possible way.  I gave them a verbal rundown.  They
arranged an appointment at their office for two days later.

I bought another new GM684-SP60-12v and took it to the office.  I did nothing.
I touched nothing. I just talked. They stripped the panel naked, connected it
to a meter on volts and another meter on amps, put a D battery in the circuit
(connected to and operating a transistor radio to keep it less than full, I
guess, though I must admit I couldn't follow half of what they were doing -
they are scientists), placed the lot in the sun and notated the readings: 2.8
volts, and I didn't catch the amps.

Them young whippersnappers were going too fast for this old cougar.  We all
boarded one of their cars and went driving along a freeway.  One of the
scientists held the naked panel out the passenger window in the sun. The rest
of the equipment was inside. As the car accelerated to the speed limit, the
volts climbed to 8 volts and the amps likewise trebled.  I will resist the
temptation to tart up this report with their superlatives. You can use your
imagination.

I thanked for their help, left and have not seen them since to have a good
yarn, though we keep in touch. I will not name them. This whole report might
turn out to be a fizzer and they have their hard-earned reputations. I don't
have that problem.

The only problem I have is to  make this report as clear as I possibly can so
you can take over. I then figured out that a multidirectional coil might be
the best way to go for the Earth's magnetic field electron accelerator.

It struck me that a vehicle powered by the work-up from the knowledge base I
had so far gathered, or an electric train, trolley bus or other public
transport electric vehicle harvesting by hardware on top and feeding the
harvest into the existing electricity distribution grid, would of course be
continually changing direction and the flat coil wouldn't be correctly
orientated except now and then.

I bought two aluminium rods, 1m x 5mm x 2mm, costing $5. I wound them around a
bottle to make two coils the shape of a small barrel-loaf of bread. I attached
them at right angles to each other on a small plank and nailed two pieces of
wood to the underside of the plank.

Thus I made a slot between so the rig would sit on the passenger window of
my car. When I wound the window up, the rig jammed in position like one of
those indicator arms on the old car I used to drive in my youth.  I connected
a diode to one end.  A packet of 10 cost me about $2 at Tandy's.  Next, I
connected the two coils together with a bit of flexwire.

Then I hung the yellow multimeter on the passenger side interior sunvisor
where I could easily see it while driving. I  connected from the car battery
to the multimeter to the double coil back to the battery.

Parking the car in my driveway so the passenger side was in the sun, I took
the rig off the window and moved it around to find the lowest reading - about
8 millivolts.  Didn't bother amps (wouldn't be any).  Just a simple direction
test. I stood in front of the rig to block out the sun.  About 4 millivolts
- heat factor established. To eliminate extraneous factors of power lines,
media transmissions et al, I drove into the middle of several school playing
fields, several miles apart, taking a couple of my sons with me in case these
tired old eyes deceived themselves.

Driving around in circles, the volts climbed astonishingly in some directions
and dived equally startingly in others. I found the highest reading to be in a
generally southern orientation, moving or stationery.

The volts read 180 millivolts - an increase in  percentage too mind-boggling
for me to say more.  I have tried to make this report as accurate as I can but
I'm only human, just as fallible as you. I've  figured it out as best I can.

I can offer no qualifications - I left school as a scholastic disaster when I
turned 15 more than 40 years ago and have had no schooling since.  Magazine
readerland is choc-a-bloc with minds much better than mine.

If you see hope in it, if you think it might be something more than the dreams
of a bored, stiff old bludger and want to investigate it further in a proper
scientific manner, fine.  It's all yours. I seek no money and less fame.

I couldn't proceed any further if the world gave me a blank cheque, the best
electronic laboratory on the planet and the finest scientific minds to help
me.  I believe those things are you. I can be contacted via mail addressed to
me (Richard Edwards) at Nexus Magazine, P.O. Box 30, Mapleton, QLD 4560.

(Is this not a wonderfully advanced attitude for people to have, I definitely
plan to write this fellow and provide him with some additional related
information for his benefit....thank you Mr. Edward!....>>>  Jerry/KeelyNet)
