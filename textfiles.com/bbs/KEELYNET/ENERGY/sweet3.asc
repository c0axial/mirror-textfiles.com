                            Phase I Operation Completed

       In 1991 we ended Phase I, and began the opening round of Phase II of
       our decades-long operation.   Phase  I was to alert the free nations
       to the dangers of Soviet scalar EM  weapons,  and  the  necessity of
       countering them.  That phase has been successfully completed.  There
       are now three other nations - not hostile to the  U.S.  -  that have
       developed and deployed  scalar  EM  weaponry.   The  Soviets/KGB are
       soundly checked by these three nations,  with  regards  to scalar EM
       weaponry.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                             Phase II Operation Begun

       The goal of  the  phase II operation is to get cheap,  clean  energy
       from the vacuum,  obtain  antigravity, and develop scalar EM healing
       of notorious diseases such as cancer,  leukemia, AIDS, etc.  In this
       phase we are now publishing papers in the orthodox  literature  that
       carry the message.  Our target is the bright young graduate students
       and postdoctoral candidates who are becoming increasingly curious in
       this area.  We  will  try  to  get  as  many  of these interested as
       possible.  The idea is to have about  100  "seed  cells",  in  major
       universities, so that   these   young   tigers  do   the   necessary
       phenomenology experiments and    produce    the   necessary   theory
       extensions.  If we can reach that  number  of seed cells, then those
       young Turks will  turn  over  the present physics.   That  Phase  II
       operation has begun.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Two Fundamental Papers Published

       For example, in  mid-1991  we  gave  (in  absentia)  two fundamental
       papers to a very large symposium  (IECEC  '91)  in  the Boston area.
       The symposium was  sponsored by IEEE, AIAA, and many  of  the  other
       leading technical societies   of   the  U.S.   The  two  papers  are
       published in the Proceedings by the American Nuclear Society.[1,2]

       One of these papers [1] tells what is wrong with quantum mechanics,

                                      Page 1





       electromagnetics, and general  relativity  -  that is, what actually
       prevents their unification.  It also  tells  what  has to be done to
       unify them.  I emphasize that the thesis in this paper  is  testable
       on the laboratory bench; it isn't just conjecture.

       The second paper  [2]  is  rather unique, to say the least.  In it I
       openly released the basic universal  mechanism  that  is  capable of
       directly tapping the    potential    energy    of     the    vacuum,
       electromagnetically.  That's a  secret  eventually worth billions of
       dollars; I freely gave it to everyone.  I discovered the theoretical
       mechanism, so it was mine to give.   The  paper  reported  on  Floyd
       Sweet's (my colleague  for  several  years)  vacuum   triode   which
       successfully taps the vacuum's virtual photon flux energy to produce
       500 watts of   time-reversed   electrical   power,   with  only  330
       microwatts of normal power input.  That device has been in existence
       since 1987 or earlier.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                        The Fundamental Mechanism Is Proven

       There are several hundred papers in  the nonlinear optics literature
       that prove that the fundamental pumped phase conjugate mirror (PPCM)
       mechanism works, in the macroscopic world.  I seem  to have been (in
       1986/87) the first person to openly treat the nucleus of the atom as
       a PPCM.

       In a proprietary  1986  draft and later 1987 paper given to Sweet, I
       produced the basic theory of how Sweet's vacuum triode device (which
       then was producing 6 watts output)  was  tapping  the vacuum energy.
       To do so, I treated the Whittaker bidirectional EM  wave  components
       of a scalar  EM  potential __ introduced onto the nucleus - as a set
       of wave/antiwave pairs or pump waves.

       This application simply  uses  the   internal   scalar   potential's
       internal structuring as clearly established by Whittaker in 1903.[3]
       With the internal   Whittaker  wave/antiwave  structure,   one   can
       establish a self-oscillation  (self-pumping)  on the barium nucleus,
       in and of the virtual photon flux (VPF) exchange between the nucleus
       and its immediately surrounding vacuum.[4]

       When that is successfully done, the  material  containing the barium
       (in Sweet's case,  barium ferrite magnets) is activated.   That  is,
       VPF exchange energy  is rhythmically flowing into the barium nucleus
       and back out again in a 60 Hz wave  __  as a wave of pure VPF stress
       potential;  a pure scalar EM wave, which is composed  of (and can be
       decomposed into) phase-locked   AM   oscillations   of  the  set  of
       Whittaker biwaves composing the potential.

       With this Whittaker  decomposition,   the   self-oscillating  barium
       nucleus is then  a  self-pumped phase conjugate mirror.   Note  that
       this "nucleus as  a  pumped  phase  conjugate  mirror" approach is a
       universal scheme for tapping the trapped energy in a massless scalar
       EM potential in the vacuum, without depleting the potential.

       The potential in the vacuum is a  function  of  vacuum VPF activity;
       the potential is continually replenished by the vacuum  itself.  The
       EM energy trapped inside the potential can be tapped forever, if the
       potential is not bled off by translating electrons (or other charged
       particles).


                                      Page 2





       Then all that  remains  to  be  done  to  tap  this vacuum-furnished
       "pumping" energy, is to utilize standard  4-wave  mixing theory from
       nonlinear optics, and  introduce  a  small  signal wave  input.   By
       standard textbook theory,  up  to  all  the energy in the pump waves
       will then be emitted by the nucleus  as  a  phase  conjugate replica
       (PCR) (time-reversed replica) of the signal wave input.

       In other words, an amplified EM energy wave - in this case, 60 Hz -
       will come from  the self-pumped nuclei and will backtrack  the  path
       taken by the   signal   wave,   in  accordance  with  the  so-called
       distortion correction theorem of orthodox nonlinear optics.[5]

       In this fashion, the energy in a potential established in vacuum can
       be directly tapped, taken from the  VPF  exchange  with the nucleus,
       and gated out of the atom and into the external circuit, to power an
       external load.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                        The Secret of Overunity EM Devices

       THIS "NUCLEUS AS A PUMPED PHASE CONJUGATE MIRROR" MECHANISM IS THE
       FUNDAMENTAL SECRET OF  ALL  LEGITIMATE OVER-UNITY DEVICES  THAT  TAP
       VACUUM ENERGY.

       The tapping device is not a closed system, but is open to the flow
       of energy from  the  vacuum  to  the  nuclei  and back.  All systems
       everywhere are open to this in-and-out  VPF  flux  exchange  anyway.
       Normally, however, the two VPF flows - in and out  -  are  equal and
       opposite, and so  the  energy exchange between vacuum and nucleus is
       in equilibrium.  In that case, none  of  the  VPF exchange energy is
       gated out to the external circuit.

       In the "activated"  case, however, the two VPF flows  (between   the
       nucleus and the  vacuum)  are  not  equal,  because part of the flow
       energy that accumulates in the in-surge  into  the  nucleus is gated
       out of the atom and into the external circuit.

       Hence the vacuum/nucleus  flux  exchange system is  not  locally  in
       equilibrium, because part  of  the  in-flow is being gated by 4-wave
       mixing accomplished in  the PPCM  barium  nuclei,  into  forming  an
       organized PCR wave, which in turn goes on out of the atom instead of
       back to the  vacuum.   Any  local  vacuum energy extracted  is  just
       instantly replaced by  the  surrounding  vacuum  -  just as a raging
       ocean instantly refills the hole left in dipping out a spoonful
       of water.

       So in the self-oscillating PPCM nucleus,  part  of the vacuum influx
       energy is gated  into  an  organized phase conjugate  replica  (PCR)
       wave, instead of  simply  being  flux-exchanged  back  to  the local
       vacuum.  This amplified  PCR wave  backtracks  the  path  previously
       taken by the input 60 Hz signal wave, and thus proceeds  out  of the
       vacuum-pumped nuclei, through  the  atom's electron shells, into and
       through the material lattice, and  arrives  in  the  outer  circuit,
       which is connected to the external electrical load.

       The device thus  powers the external load directly  off  the  energy
       organized and gated  from  the  local vacua surrounding the excited,
       activated, self-pumped barium nuclei.

                            Floyd Sweet's Vacuum Triode

       In his second  vacuum  triode,  Sweet obtained 500 watts of negative
       electrical power out (at 60 Hz and 120 volts), with an input (signal
       wave, in nonlinear optical PPCM terminology)  of only 330 microwatts
       (10 volts, 33  x  10-6 amps) from a small 60 Hz oscillator.   That's
       about a  1,500,000 power gain.  Not too bad at all.

       Sweet later "close-looped"  the device, tapping off a wee bit of the
       output, and using it as the rigidly clamped positive-feedback input.
       So his later devices put out 500  watts,  directly  from the vacuum,
       without any external input at all.

       Sweet has also built devices having 1,000 watt output and 5,000 watt
       output.  The devices also are solid state, with no moving parts.

       A nominal Sweet device outputs 1,000 watts of time-reversed (PCR) EM
       power at 60 Hz and 120 volts.  It weighs 6 pounds, and can be rigged
       to simultaneously produce  antigravity,  while it is  producing  its
       negative power.

       However, there are  still some serious problems with stability, etc.
       Also, there are serious legal problems, and in fact the entire thing
       has been in  litigation.   It may  be  that  nothing  will  ever  be
       possible with this   device,   because   of  the  horrendous   legal
       entanglements.  But the  device is real, it works (albeit it is just
       a laboratory demonstration device, and not at all a production-ready
       model).  It proves the principles,  and  the  report  is  now in the
       standard literature.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                         World's First Antigravity Success

       Also, to prove   the  scalar  EM  interpretation  of   gravity   and
       antigravity, at my  urgent  request  in 1987, Sweet specially rigged
       the device for antigravity production.  In the cited paper we report
       on the highly successful result.

       The 6-lb. weight of the object was  reduced  in  periodic  stages by
       90%, on a  scale on the lab bench, in a totally controlled,  smooth,
       slow, sustained experiment  without  transients  or  sudden  surges,
       jerks, etc.  At the same time, the  device  was  steadily  producing
       negative electrical power.

       In fact, the method of producing antigravity in a "rigged"  unit  is
       simply to force  it  to  process  more  negative  power  through the
       nucleus.  Gravitational energy is negative energy, and gravitational
       power is negative power, as is well known.

       It follows that  to first order,  antigravity  can  be  regarded  as
       simply the outputting or ejecting of negative energy from the atomic
       nucleus, through the  electron  shells  and into an  external  load,
       rather than return  of  the  negative  VPF energy back to the vacuum
       from the nucleus.

       The curve is  reproduced  in  the   paper,   and   printed   in  the
       proceedings.  I had  qualitatively predicted the results,  prior  to
       the experiment.



                                      Page 4





       What is not  printed  in  the proceedings is that, with another more
       powerful model, Sweet has actually  fully  levitated the entire 6-lb
       unit, and "flown"  it  above  the  bench,  via  this   approach   to
       antigravity.

       So the scalar EM theory works.  It's still tricky, and we're just at
       the stage that normal EM went through with "cat fur, glass rods, and
       pith balls." But  slowly we're getting there.  Still, we desperately
       need to develop good instrumentation  for detecting (1) the absolute
       scalar potential, including  its  magnitude,  and   (2)   the  exact
       Whittaker bidirectional EM  wave  harmonic  structure  of the scalar
       potential.  We know how to approach  that  problem,  but  it will be
       quite expensive, and  funding  to  do  that  has simply  never  been
       available.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                     "Energy" Is Presently Incorrectly Defined

       To illustrate just  how  poorly  some  of  the foundations of normal
       science (including physics) are known,  let  me  point  out that the
       present definition of energy is totally wrong.  Now  there's  a real
       attention grabber of a statement!  Can I prove it? Let's see.

       The present "definition"  of  energy  in  science  is usually stated
       something like this.  "Energy is  the  capacity  to do work."  Well,
       that statement happens to be totally, hopelessly  false.   It  isn't
       even correct logic.  Here's why.

       What is work?  Ultimately,  work  is the scattering (disordering) of
       energy.  We can always resort to  calorimetry,  e.g.,  and determine
       the warming  of a solution (such as water) by a mechanically-powered
       paddlewheel, to convert  mechanical energy to heat energy, etc.  But
       in QM, all  mechanical  forces are  generated  by  the  exchange  of
       virtual photons, so  even  mechanical  force  is electromagnetic  at
       base.  Hence mechanical  force  times distance is also EM-generated,
       at its causative base.  Eventually,  mechanical  and electromagnetic
       work involves the scattering of EM energy.

       So substituting for  the term "work" in the accepted  definition  of
       energy, the standard  definition  is  really  this:  "Energy  is the
       (capacity to do)  scattering  of   energy."[6]    That's   logically
       contradictory.  It says that energy is just its own scattering!  And
       that's nonsense.

       Try it on  the  notion  of a fishhook.  I can truthfully  state:  "A
       fishhook can be   used  to  catch  fish."   That's  perfectly  okay.
       However, we cannot accurately define  a  fishhook  as "A fishhook IS
       the capacity to  catch fish." That's a non sequitur.   We  can  say,
       accurately, that "a  fishhook  HAS  the  (innate)  capacity to catch
       fish," and that  is  accurate.    That's   just  a  statement  about
       fishhooks, it is  not  a  definition.   But we cannot  say  that  "a
       fishhook IS the  capacity  to  catch fish."  Indeed, a fishhook IS a
       bent piece of wire, where one end  is  usually curved with a barb on
       the tip.

       Similarly, we can say that "energy HAS the capacity to do work," and
       that is logically accurate.  In that form, it's just  a statement of
       one of the  things  that  energy  can  be  used  to do.  One can, by
       scattering the energy, do work - since  work  is just the scattering
       of energy in the first place.  But one cannot say that "Energy IS

                                      Page 5





       the capacity to do work."  A thing cannot be defined as just its own
       scattering!

       I find it  remarkable  -  even  astounding  -  that  generations  of
       scientists and engineers  have  apparently  failed  to  notice  this
       simple, elementary fact.   Could it be that all the  physicists  and
       engineers are presently  wrong  in their notion as to precisely what
       energy IS?  If so, then (one might  say)  what,  pray  tell,  is it?
       What is energy anyway?
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                       A Fundamental Redefinition of Energy

       Here's the precise  definition:   ENERGY  IS  ANY  ORDERING,  EITHER
       STATIC OR DYNAMIC,  IN THE VIRTUAL PARTICLE FLUX OF VACUUM.  Period.
       Note that energy overall refers to  the flux of any and all kinds of
       virtual particles in  the  vacuum.  It can be any kind  of  ordering
       imposed in or on any or some or all of those particle fluxes.

       But when you  put  an  adjective  modifier  in  front  of  the  word
       "energy", then you have selected a particular type of flux.  In that
       case you have to discriminate the  type  of  quantum particle of the
       field, comprising the  flux  that is being referred  to.   Like  the
       following:

       Definition of Electromagnetic Energy

       Electromagnetic energy is any ordering, either static or dynamic, in
       the virtual photon  flux  of  vacuum.   In  other words, for a field
       energy, one selects only the type of particle in the VPF that is the
       quantum particle of that field.

       Let's continue:  Nowhere in physics - in all of physics - does there
       appear a legitimate   definition   of   the   electrostatic   scalar
       potential.  The normal  "definition"  utilized  or   advanced  is  a
       prescription for calculating  its  magnitude.   I  could  not find a
       single physicist or electrical engineer  who could accurately define
       it.  So I  went  to  QM  and  dug  out  what it is,  myself.   Let's
       continue:

       Definitions of Some Types of Potentials

       A potential is any ordering, either static or dynamic or combination
       thereof, in the virtual particle flux of vacuum.

       Note that, according to this definition, a potential is pure energy,
       a priori.  But  we  must  be  careful.  Because of the nature of the
       virtual particle flux comprising it,  the  potential is a collection
       of individual virtual  energies  -  a collection of  the  individual
       energies of a  host  of individually moving virtual particles.  Each
       particle is still almost totally separate  from  each other, most of
       the time.  In other words, as an informal analogy,  potential  is  a
       sort of mostly disintegrated energy, which only has just a touch of
       integration, enough to  allow  it  to  be  referred  to  as a single
       "collection" or "ordering."

       A scalar potential  is  any  static  (stationary)  ordering  in  the
       virtual particle flux of vacuum.  A vector potential  is any dynamic
       (nonstationary) ordering in the virtual particle flux of vacuum.  So
       scalar potentials and vector potentials are simply different subsets
       of the energy domain.
                                      Page 6





       An electrostatic scalar   potential   is   any  static  (stationary)
       ordering in the virtual photon flux of vacuum.  And so on.

       Now those are all precise definitions.  To the best of my knowledge,
       they have not previously appeared in physics.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Internal Wave Structure of A Scalar Potential

       However, with respect  to the electrostatic  scalar  potential,  one
       still has a conceptual problem.  Any photon in the  vacuum  must  of
       necessity be moving  at an average velocity of c, it would seem.  So
       how does one have a "stationary"  ordering  of  these extremely fast
       photons?  In other words, how do you catch and "hold  stationary"  a
       particle that's moving  at  luminal  velocity,  and  have  it  still
       continuing to move that fast?

       It's simply a special case of a kind  of  "standing wave" stationary
       solution by another name.  Indeed, Whittaker decomposes  the  scalar
       potential into bidirectional  pairs  (in  a  harmonic  series) of EM
       waves.[7]  In other   words,   a  scalar   electrostatic   potential
       internally consists of  -  and  is  composed of - paired  EM  waves,
       passing through each  other,  in  pairs  in a harmonic set.  Sort of
       like a Fourier expansion set of harmonic  waves,  coupled  with  its
       phase conjugate set that is present at the same time.   Notice  that
       the harmonic wavepairs are phase-locked in frequency and time.


       Hence this structure  establishes an organized, standing, stationary
       spatiotemporal lattice directly  in  the  vacuum  potential.   It is
       strongly pointed out  that this represents a local organization  and
       structuring of spacetime itself.

       Further, a given  potential  created  by our circuits is a change in
       the trapped local EM energy of the  vacuum.  It therefore represents
       a local curvature  of  spacetime,  and  this  local   curvature   is
       Whittaker-structured.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                        Gravitons, Photons, and Antiphotons

       So we look at one pair of Whittaker waves, at its wave and antiwave
       components.  We point   out  that  the  antiwave  is  a  true  phase
       conjugate (time-reversal) twin of  the  wave.  In that wave/antiwave
       pair, photons in  the  wave are moving forward (say,  from  left  to
       right) in one  direction, and antiphotons in the antiwave are moving
       back (say, from  right  to  left).   In  other  words,  photons  and
       antiphotons are present and constantly meeting each  other  in  each
       wave/antiwave pair.

       Further, the antiwave  is  precisely  coupled  to  the wave by phase
       conjugation.  This requires that  photons  and  antiphotons are also
       continually and precisely coupling - which they can do and will do
       if one is a precise phase conjugate of the other - and decoupling.

       But when momentarily  coupled,  the  photon/antiphoton   pair   have
       helicity 2.  In  other  words,  at  that  moment  the  paired system
       (couple) is stationary.   As  a crude  visual  model,  each  may  be
       visualized as "whirling around" (orbiting) the other momentarily, so
       that each has  tangential  velocity  c,  but  oppositely   directed,
       producing a spin-2 system that is momentarily "trapped" and not

                                      Page 7





       translating.[8]  In this fashion a photon may be "spatially trapped"
       in a graviton  system, but the individual photon may still be moving
       with tangential velocity  c, even  though  the  graviton  system  is
       stationary.

       Thus what we have in the Whittaker bidirectional wave  structure  of
       the scalar EM  potential  is the continual formation and dissolution
       of stationary spin-2  gravitons,   with   photons   and  antiphotons
       continually entering and  exiting  each  coupling   position.    The
       gravitons resulting from    the   photon   coupling/uncoupling   are
       statistical, for they are continually being created and destroyed.

       Those statistical gravitons  are what  comprise  the  "electrostatic
       scalar potential," and  constitute the convolution  of  the  locally
       trapped photons.  Consequently,  the  local EM energy trapped in the
       scalar EM potential exists in that form.

       Note that, because of the arrangement of the photon/antiphoton pairs
       into a harmonic series, all the EM waves in the entire Whittaker set
       are phase-locked, as are the gravitons.   This means that the phase-
       locked graviton sets represent an ordered spacetime graviton lattice
       __ containing EM energy ordered both dynamically and  statically  in
       frequency, energy, space, and time.

       So, the scalar electrostatic potential is actually a hidden graviton
       latticing organization of local spacetime itself.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Photon Interaction And Newton's Third Law

       It follows that, in photon interactions, normally we actually have a
       bust-up of a  graviton,  so that we have two photon interactions,[9]
       not one, as follows:  (1) the freed  forward-time  photon  interacts
       with the shell  electrons  of  the  atom,  which  is   the  reaction
       contained in the   textbooks,   and   (2)  the  freed  time-reversed
       antiphoton interacts with  the  nucleus   of  the  atom  to  produce
       Newton's third law reaction force.[10]
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                       The Scalar Potential Is Gravitational

       Now that we  know  that  the  scalar  potential  is   comprised   of
       gravitons, we can  understand why the potential is gravitational (as
       is well-known in general relativity.)[11]  We also realize something
       even more important:   We  realize   precisely   how   gravitational
       potential is made  and  sustained  electromagnetically.    In  other
       words, we now  understand electrogravitation.  Note that, so far, we
       have described a very "linear" condition  in  spacetime,  where  the
       local spacetime from one point to its neighboring  points  does  not
       change in the  photon coupling constituency of the graviton lattice.
       Such a spacetime is locally flat.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Curved and Flat Local Spacetimes

       However, it follows that we also should be able to do some nonlinear
       things to make the average photon/antiphoton  coupling  differ  from
       spin-2.  In that  case, we can have some multiple  photon  couplings
       greater than helicity 2.  We can also have the occasional failure of
       photon and antiphoton  to  couple,  so  that the average coupling is
       less than helicity 2.


                                      Page 8





       Because of the  continual creation and annihilation of gravitons, in
       describing "the" graviton we are  speaking  of  the  average  photon
       coupling over a finite time, where the average smooths and becomes a
       constant value, and where by "photon" we refer to both  photons  and
       antiphotons.

       If so, we  then  have  this  characteristic:   If the average photon
       coupling in the  vacuum EM potential  is  spin-2,  then  that's  the
       "linear" coupling case, and the local spacetime is  flat (uncurved).
       If the average   coupling  is  less  than  spin-2,  then  the  local
       spacetime is curved in one direction.   It  is  deficient in photons
       for its preferred  coupling,  so  it acts as a photon  sink,  or  EM
       energy sink.  So  to  speak,  such  a potential/vacuum/spacetime has
       "unfilled photon holes - sort of a  slightly  depleted "Dirac photon
       sea."  On the other hand, if the average coupling  is  greater  than
       spin-2, the local spacetime is curved in the opposite direction.  It
       has a surplus  of  photons, so it acts as a photon source - in other
       words, as an EM energy source.   In  this  case,  it  is  a  sort of
       "excited Dirac photon sea."

       Just as the  spacetime/vacuum  possesses a negative  energy  sea  of
       Dirac electrons, so  it  possesses a negative energy sea of photons.
       When it's flat, all the negative  energy  "holes"  are  filled  with
       virtual photons.  When  it's curved in one direction,  some  of  the
       holes are empty,   and   the  local  spacetime  will  "absorb"  some
       available photons.  When it's curved  in  the  other  direction,  an
       excess of virtual photons/antiphotons are crammed in there in excess
       of the holes, so the spacetime will emit photons  and  serve  as  an
       energy source.

       Remember that spacetime/vacuum   to   first  order  is  just  scalar
       potential.  We can have a negative  or  a  positive  potential, as a
       delta compared to the normal or ambient vacuum potential.   And when
       we speak of curved spacetime, we are just talking about a surplus or
       shortage of trapped  photon  energy coupling density to comprise the
       local vacuum/potential.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Potential, Vacuum, Spacetime, and Energy

       The four words, potential, vacuum, spacetime, and static energy turn
       out to be essentially identities.   Also, all of them have a dynamic
       substructure.  That is, a vacuum per se is structured/ordered, since
       it is essentially  a scalar potential.  To first  order,  it  is  an
       electrostatic scalar EM  potential, in the manner shown by Whittaker
       to have an internal bidirectional EM wave harmonic structure.

       A spacetime is internally structured; this provides direct access to
       "hyperspace" engineering, since the  "internal" part of spacetime is
       hyperspatial, mathematically.  But with the Whittaker  approach,  it
       is straightforward to  directly  engineer  this  internal hyperspace
       aspect.

       The ultimate engineering   is   hyperspatial   engineering,   vacuum
       engineering, engineering of   potentials,  engineering   of   vacuum
       engines, energizing the  vacuum,  energizing  spacetime, structuring
       the local curvature   of   spacetime,   engineering   the   internal
       electromagnetics, etc.  All  these things are identically  the  same
       thing.  They are all part of scalar electromagnetics.


                                      Page 9





       Interference of vacua/potentials generates what we call EM waves in
       vacuum.[12]  These waves  may  move  either  time-forward  or  time-
       reversed (antiwaves).  You  can also  engineer  this  direct  scalar
       interferometry to produce,  stabilize,  and control  EM  energy,  in
       static or dynamic  form,  as  Whittaker  showed  in  1904, even at a
       distance.[13]
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Overunity Condition: Tapping The Potential

       So, as you might surmise, in scalar EM we can curve local spacetime,
       and use it as either a source or a  sink  of EM energy.  Once we pay
       to move a set of charges so as to establish a particular  excitation
       and structure to  the  local  or distant spacetime, so long as we do
       not allow the  depletion of the charges,  they  continue  to  "pump"
       virtual photons (that is what electric charge is, according  to  QM)
       and sustain that      particular      active/excited/      energetic
       spacetime/vacuum/potential.  If virtual EM photon energy is removed
       from that excited/activated vacuum region, the surrounding activated
       vacuum instantly replaces it, continually and forever.

       Now we are free to build a device  which (1) establishes the excited
       vacuum/spacetime/potential in the first place, and (2) then taps off
       the virtual photon  energy  of the excited vacuum potential  itself,
       without allowing depletion  of the sustaining charged particles that
       are fixed in position and creating/pumping  the  virtual photon flux
       that creates the potential.  We can tap the continual  power  of the
       Whittaker EM biwaves  flowing  through  the excited vacuum potential
       forever, without exhausting it.  I

       t is simply comparable to putting a paddlewheel in a river, where in
       this case the  Whittaker bidirectional  EM  wave  structure  is  the
       river, and a special tapping device or process is the "paddlewheel."
       We can extract all the energy we wish, forever, from the stream, and
       the vacuum itself will continually and forever replenish  the stream
       as fast as we extract the power.

       So we can build an over-unity machine, IF WE TAP THE LOCALLY ALTERED
       VACUUM POTENTIAL'S HIDDEN WHITTAKER RIVER, rather than releasing the
       sustaining electrical charges/VPF  spray  pumps  we  accumulated  to
       create that altered potential.

       If you release  the  charges  (the   electrons,   e.g.)   as  normal
       electrical engineers are  trained to do, the charges  translate  and
       mechanically bang and  clang  their way through resistances, etc. on
       the way to  electrical  ground,  depleting   the  potential  in  the
       process.  This banging  and  clanging  produces  scattering  of  the
       order/energy in the potential and hence does work.  But that way you
       only get one shot of it.  It's a one-time thing, and then you've got
       to pay to  move  in  some more charges, build another potential, and
       release the potential and the charges so the charges will go banging
       and clanging through the circuit  again,  scattering  energy (order)
       and producing one-time work again.

       That's a very poor way to do business.  It's rather like having some
       free, self-powered pumps,  building  a  dam  to  hold   some   water
       pressure, moving in  some  of  the pumps and pumping up water behind
       the dam to provide the pressure,  then  knocking  down  the  dam and
       releasing the pumps and the water simultaneously, so  that the water
       will rush out and push the pumps along to bump into things along the

                                      Page 10





       flow channel and  do  "banging and clanging" work.  Yes, you can get
       some work done by the pumps one time  that way.  But it's a "hell of
       a way to run a railroad!"  Yet all our present electrical engineers
       and electrical scientists are trained to plan, develop,  build,  and
       utilize just such crude EM systems!
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Nature's Engines: Charged Particles Are Pumps

       Charged particles, in  quantum  mechanics,  are engaged in a violent
       virtual particle flux exchange with the vacuum.  The violent virtual
       photon exchange between vacuum and mass particle is what creates and
       constitutes the electrical charge  on  that  particle  of  mass.  In
       other words, the  electrically charged particle is  nature's  little
       "spray engine" or  "spray pump," with respect to virtual photon flux
       or spray.

       The magnitude of the electrostatic  scalar  potential created by the
       accumulated charges (spray  pumps)  represents the  local  magnitude
       (flux/spray density) of that virtual photon "spray."  It has nothing
       to do with  the  mass  of  the charges, except that nature has built
       those particular masses to be "little self-powered spray pumps."

       When we "charge up" an accumulator,  such  as  a  steel  sphere or a
       capacitor, we push  in  the  electrons  so  that  they  pack  closer
       together, and we  thus  increase  the  virtual  photon spray density
       because we've accumulated more sprayers  in  a  confined  volumetric
       region.  The volumetric spray density represents  the  magnitude  of
       the electrostatic scalar potential (ESP), in this analogy.

       Contrary to conventional  wisdom,  Whittaker proved that this scalar
       potential - this "spray density"  -  is  internally  organized  into
       hidden, flowing, bidirectional  EM  waves.[14]  EM  forcefield  wave
       Energy is flowing  in  both directions.  In the electrostatic scalar
       potential, the net Poynting vector  resultant  is  zero, but it is a
       "sum-zero system" composed of an infinite set of opposite  but equal
       finite Poynting vectors.   That zero vector resultant is a scalar EM
       potential.  It's got lots and lots  of EM energy flowing both in and
       out simultaneously, but  these flows are normally  balanced  and  in
       equilibrium.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                     The Overunity Electrical Machine's Secret

       However, if we  could  tap  the  EM  energy in those hidden EM waves
       flowing oppositively inside the ESP, we could extract EM energy from
       the vacuum.  We could "gate" some of the spray energy, that comes in
       from the vacuum to the charged particle,  into  the external circuit
       instead of back  out  to  the  vacuum.   If  so,  we  can  use  that
       "extracted and externally gated EM energy" to power a load.

       The "nucleus as a Whittaker-pumped phase conjugate mirror" mechanism
       I found in  1986,  furnished  to  Floyd  Sweet  in  early  1987, and
       released in 1991   allows  precisely   that   tapping   and   gating
       capability.







                                      Page 11





       Here's the magic secret of all electrical over-unity machines:

          1) TAP THE VIRTUAL PHOTON SPRAY.
          2) TAP THE ENERGY IN THE MASSLESS VACUUM POTENTIAL.
          3) DO NOT RELEASE THE SPRAY PUMPS.
          4) DO  NOT  ALLOW  CURRENT FLOW IN THAT PART OF THE CIRCUIT WHERE
             THE CHARGE PUMPS ARE COLLECTED TO CREATE THE POTENTIAL.
          5) OR AT LEAST ALLOW ONLY THE ABSOLUTE  MINIMUM OF FLOW/BLEED-OFF
             THERE, OF THE PUMPS.
          6) ORGANIZE, GATE, AND APPLY THE POTENTIAL SPRAY  TO THE EXTERNAL
             CIRCUIT, WHERE  IT WILL ATTACH TO AVAILABLE ELECTRONS, FORMING
             FORCE FIELDS, VOLTAGE, AND CURRENTS  TO  PUMP ELECTRONS AROUND
             THE CIRCUIT.
          7) USE THOSE EXTERNALLY POWERED FIELDS AND CURRENTS  TO POWER THE
             LOAD.

       You can freely  tap the potential's VPF "spray" forever, once one is
       created in the vacuum.  As fast as you scavenge out the power in the
       spray, it is just renewed by the  continued  pumping  of the charged
       particle "spray pumps." Nature and nature's excited vacuum potential
       "flux-spray" provide and replenish that pumping and  that power, for
       free, forever.

       So the altered  vacuum  (potential)  is a universal "virtual-photon-
       flux fuel" if you construct your  power  units  correctly.   But you
       must engineer things  one  step  deeper  than the present  seriously
       flawed electromagnetics prescribes.

       Similar constructions give  the  secret  of gravity and antigravity,
       and how to engineer them as well.  However, that is beyond the scope
       of this paper.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                   All Systems Are Open To Vacuum Flux Exchange

       As we stated,  our attention is no  longer  directed  to  scalar  EM
       weapons, but to the Phase II operation.  That is progressing;  there
       are at present several legitimate devices or processes  that produce
       overunity.  We reiterate  that  this  is  nothing mystical;  none of
       these systems or  processes is a  closed  system,  so  closed-system
       energy conservation need not apply locally.

       Indeed, there is  really no such thing in the universe  as  a  truly
       closed system, anywhere.   Every  system  is  open  to  the vacuum's
       virtual particle flux, and is in fact already in a fantastic virtual
       particle exchange with the vacuum.   Normally,  however,  the influx
       and the outflux are equal in absolute magnitude; hence the system is
       in internal equilibrium vis-a-vis the vacuum.

       However, if one  breaks  the  equilibrium  in  this   internal  flux
       exchange, and organizes and gates a portion of that influx on out of
       the atom and into the external circuits, one can power an external
       electromagnetic load directly from the extracted vacuum energy.

       It is no  more  mysterious  than  placing a paddlewheel in a flowing
       stream, to extract some useful energy  as shaft horsepower.  We just
       have a more esoteric stream and a more esoteric paddlewheel.

                                   In Conclusion

       We also point  out  that  there are no irrevocable "laws" of nature.
       Every so-called "law  of  physics"   is  just  a  great  and  useful
       generalization, based on certain fixed assumptions,  that holds in a
       broad area.  If  the assumptions are violated, however, the law need
       no longer hold, and it can be violated.

       Scientific proof is proof by the  experimental  method,  not  by the
       authoritarian pronouncements of orthodox scientists.  Unfortunately,
       orthodoxy as yet knows nothing of the process we are  advancing,  or
       of scalar electromagnetics.   In  the unorthodox experimental arena,
       however, scalar EM is still a newborn  infant in the womb, but it is
       thriving and advancing.  It is up to us to serve as midwives and get
       the infant born.

       4.  This self-oscillation  in  barium  compounds  is  well-known  in
           nonlinear optics,  although   it   is   usually   experimentally
           accomplished in the optical frequency regime.  Sweet brilliantly
           discovered how to initiate this self-oscillation or self-pumping
           at ELF frequencies, such as 60 Hz.

           optical phase conjugation.

       6.  Shortly below, energy will be  defined  as  a  certain  kind  of
           order.  So  the  present  "definition"  of  energy  actually  is
           stating that "order is the disordering of order."  In that form,
           the logical  contradiction  in  the  "definition" is immediately
           apparent.

       8.  This is  true  because  the  wave and antiwave are interferring.
           Such interference produces galloping  waves, whose instantaneous
           velocity varies from the speed of light.

           The galloping  wave slows to, say, 0.01 c, then  rushes  forward
           again at  100  c,  then  slows,  then speeds up, and so on.  Its
           average velocity  is  c.   But  its  instantaneous  velocity  is
           usually anything  but  c.   See William G. Harter,  John  Evans,
           Roberto Vega,  and  Sanford  Wilson.  "Galloping waves and their
           relativistic properties." American  Journal  of  Physics, 53(7),
           July 1985, p. 671-679.

       9.  Occasionally yet   another  physicist  discovers   that   photon
           interaction is  actually  binary,  and that we ignore or discard
           half of  almost  all  of  our measurements.   For  example,  see
           Richard Kidd  et al, "Evolution of the Modern Photon,"  American
           Journal of  Physics,  57(1),  Jan.  1989, p. 27-35.  See also R.

           Physics, 49(4), Apr. 1981, p. 372.

       10. Essentially this has been experimentally proven.  E.g., when one
           has a phase conjugate material,  it  may  emit either photons (a
           normal wave) or antiphotons (a time-reversed or  phase-conjugate
           wave).

           Now, if  I  am  right  as  to  the  genesis of Newtonian 3rd law
           reaction force, then when the  material  emits  a  time-reversed
           wave, or  an antiphoton, the material should not  recoil.   Such
           experiments have   in   fact   been  done  in  nonlinear  optics
           experiments, and  "inexplicably"   a   phase   conjugate  mirror
           material does not recoil when it emits an antiphoton  or a phase
           conjugate wave,  seemingly  violating Newton's third law!  So it
           seems I am correct after all.

       11. In the modern GR view, all trapped  energy is gravitational.  It
           is the  trapped EM energy in mass, e.g., that is  gravitational.
           Mass is in fact a highly intense mass potential.

           Since any  scalar potential is also a form of trapped EM energy,
           that energy - and hence the potential also - is gravitational in
           nature.

       12. E.T. Whittaker, "On an expression  of  the electromagnetic field
           due to  electrons  by means of two scalar potential  functions,"
           Proceedings of  the  London Mathematical Society, Series 2, Vol.
           1, 1904,  p.  367-372.   Here Whittaker  demonstrates  that  the
           present forcefield  electromagnetics can be replaced  by  scalar
           potential interferometry.  And I'm called a lunatic for speaking
           of scalar interferometry!

           Rigorously the  scalar  potential  is  composed  of  a  dynamic,
           opposing vector forcefield wave  internal structure.  Internally
           it's vectorial;  externally it's scalar.  Whittaker  1903  tells
           how to  make  standing  scalar  potentials; these can be made as
           beams.

           And one can then interfere the two scalar EM beams to produce EM
           force fields directly in distant  charged  particle  systems, by
           Whittaker 1904.

           waves.
