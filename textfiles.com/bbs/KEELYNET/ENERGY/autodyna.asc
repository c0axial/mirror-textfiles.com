Hi Bob!

The keelynet@ix.netcom.com address is the InterNet address for the original
KeelyNet located in Dallas.  It is not currently linked in any way to the
InterNet, but there are 'mirror' files from the board.

Therefore, anything you might want posted on the protree.com page should be
addressed to   Bob Garth    bgarth@protree.com

I am attempting to forward him a copy of this document so he will have your
information and a contact address hilster@coyote.TRW.COM

Thank you for the notice, how would one go about getting this 75 pages of
compiled material and is it possible for it to be listed as a file for many
others to study??....thanks...>>>  Jerry/Sysop/KeelyNet BBS
