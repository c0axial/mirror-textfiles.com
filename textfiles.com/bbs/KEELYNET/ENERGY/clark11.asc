    Tesla Technology : The Faraday-Tesla-Clark High Current D.C. Generator
                              by Richard L. Clark

In the theories and discoveries of Faraday there is a well-known device called
the Farady Unipolar Generator.  This generator system's theory and
construction design is carried in most standard Physics and Electrical
Engineering texts and handbooks.  The models and designs shown are in fact a
later Tesla improved design of the basic system.

The basic disc rotating in a magnetic field to produce an extremely high
current, low voltage direct current is standard technology.  The Faraday
Unipolar Generator is also a standard Faraday Unipolar Motor.

If you turn the disc mechanically, the disc rotating in the fixed, parallel to
rotation, magnetic field causes a direct current of high current and low
voltage to appear at the two output terminals.

But conversely, if you apply a high current, low voltage direct current to the
output terminals of this same unit, it will rotate mechanically as a motor via
the disc being a conductor in the magnetic field.  So much for the present
theory and design as accepted by all standards and professionals currently.

The Clark modification to the Faraday Unipolar Generator-Motor will now be
outlined.  The previously fixed permanent magnets, or electromagnets, that
formed the magnetic field for the Faraday Generator-Motor are now attached to
the disc itself as a part of the rotating element.  Now the Faraday design is
only a generator and NOT a motor.  A voltage and current across the output
terminals does NOTHING but see a nearly dead short, and therefore, it is no
longer a motor at all.

But when the disc is rotated mechanically it is still a generator unit of very
high current and low voltage direct current as previously designed by Faraday.

The GAIN from this modification is that the output load does NOT put a motor
type drag on the disc drive element as the load current INCREASES.  Thus, the
rotational drive force for rotation of the disc is CONSTANT, without regard to
current drawn by the generator output load.  The Clark modified Faraday
Generator can therefore EXCEED 100% input power to output power efficiencies,
producing "free energy".  So much for Lenz's Law and back EMF problems.

The best unit would be a Faraday-Motor driving a Clark Modified Faraday
Generator Unit.  This is because of the IDENTICAL current and voltage
requirements of these two systems on a common shaft drive design.

To start this unit a simple pull-rope could be used to rotate the system
initially.  Once turning, the generator outputs and drives the motor, which
turns the generator, bootstrapping up to the controlled speed regulation
point.  Then the surplus generator output, above motor running power, is
available to run external power needs - lights, motors, etc.

Since this is a high current, low voltage direct current generator system, an
inverter unit is necessary to convert the direct current output into
alternating current of 60Hz and 115 volts for standard household utility.

Should the reader wish to build a small working model of this Clark Modified
Faraday Generator, the brief plans will be given:

  On a six-inch long, 3/8 inch diameter brass or copper rod,
  place a copper or brass washer of 3 to 6 cm diameter, about 1/8 inch thick.

  Obtain 6 to 8 radio store ceramic toroid magnets for about 25 cents each,
  giving you a 2,000 or 3,000 Gauss magnetic stack.

  Place all these magnets in a stack, north pole up.

  Place 4 of these magnets on the rod below the copper or brass washer and the
  other 4 on top of the washer.

  All polarities of the magnets MUST face toward the same end of the rod,.

  Now rotate the rod, north magnetic and clockwise, in an electric drill or
  lathe chuck.

  Using a sensitive voltage-current meter, the output can be read between the
  outer edge of the disc and the center of the rod.

  The formula for this device is:
           E out = disc area in cm(2) X gauss of magnets
                   X revolutions per second of the disc X 10(-8).
          (cm(2) is cm squared and 10(-8) is 10 to the negative 8th)

Great care should be observed in balancing and handling of this flywheel
device at high speeds.  The gains in larger design models are in the disc
(flywheel) radius by the SQUARES, and only linear for Gauss and rotational
velocity.  Therefore, new designs need large radius discs as the primary
optionizing model parameter.

The units can be linked in series to raise the ouput voltage level.  Be very
careful on all wiring terminations to minimize resistance.

Copies of this paper and the proper submission forms have been sent to the
Energy-Related Inventions Office of the National Bureau of Standards and other
Federal Government officials.  Copies are also being sent to all of the
newsletters of the free-energy and clean-energy movement for consideration for
their publications.  I am going to develop and market these clean, fuel-free
generator systems for American consumers at the most reasonable prices
possible.

Other applications of this Clark-Modified Faraday Generator system would be to
propel electric automobiles without the heavy and costly batteries.  Small
aircraft and boats can also be built or modified to use this new power system.
Also, using the known Townsend Effect, a LIFT type of airframe, like a "flying
saucer" can be built based on this new generator as a polarized capacitor and
flywheel inertia system.

                        The Faraday Unipolar Generator
      (excerpted from Towards a New Electromagnetic Reality - Part 1 of 3
  by Donald Reed of Tachion Energy Research, Box 192, South Wales, NY 14134))

Perhaps one of the earliest observations of an electromagnetic enigma, was
noted by Michael Faraday in 1831.  He discovered that a rotating magnetized
conductor, with axis of rotation passing through the magnetic poles, could act
as an electrical generator with voltage developed between the point of the
axis of rotation and the outer periphery of the rotating magnets.  This he
called a homopolar or unipolar generator.

Now, up to Faraday's time, it had been assumed that a magnet moving in any
manner CARRIED ITS FIELD ALONG WITH IT.  But in that case, contrary to
Faraday's experimental results, no voltage could be produced.

It thus became necessary for Faraday to postulate that the material of the
magnet moved through its magnetic field which, in itself, was not supposed to
be moved by the magnet generating it.  (the field remains stationary!!)

Oddly enough, the controversy still rages today between proponents of the two
theories.  In fact, no application of standard electromagnetic theory to date
has been able to resolve the question.

To make matters worse, even if one takes Faraday's position, assuming a
STATIONARY MAGNETIC FIELD, subsequent analysis shows that one branch of
electromagnetics, the Coulomb-Ampere law, predicts the observed voltage;
whereas Maxwell's equations show that NO POTENTIAL WILL EXIST.

If this weren't enough to lend mystery to the devices' operation, it has
recently been discovered by Bruce dePalma, over a century following Faraday,
that the unipolar generator, in a new embodiment he has called the N-Machine,
produces NO DRAG on the rotor system.  This is contrary to the predictions of
Lenz' Law, one of the standard principles of electromagnetic induction.

(Lenz' law is the backward flowing electromotive force when the reverse
rotation of the shaft canses a reverse current flow, this reverse flow
collides with the forward moving current to create heating in the circuit
resulting in a significant reduction in efficiency)

                     conducting disc (metal washer)

Notes  :  1)  the shaft rotates freely in the center hole of the disc magnet
              stacks and the washer, it DOES NOT TOUCH the magnets
          2)  Radio Shack sells a package of 5 disc magnets with a hole in the
              center for $1.69
          3)  there is a limit to how many magnets you can stack before the
              field strength begins to weaken, experiences with the TOMIBILD
              circuit show that 10 of these disc magnets in a single stack is
              about the best number to use and still have high field strength
          4)  remember Homopolar Generators produce high current, low voltage,
              Tewari reports 1500 amps at 2 volts from his heavy duty units,
              but you won't get anything like that from this small one
          5)  and keep in mind that heating occurs when the flow of direct
              current is resisted, so keep your connections as solid and
              secure as possible
          6)  the use of carbon contacts, held in a sleeve and with a flat
              metal coil on the outside end to maintain pressure against the
              rotating shaft are one of the most common methods to tap off the
              current, though dePalma uses mercury in an enclosed plexiglas
              chamber, if you choose to use mercury, make sure you have good
              ventilation and use safe handling techniques

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In bandying about some ideas on this with Chuck Henderson, he suggested using
a slot car motor, some of which run at 1.5 volts, others at 3 volts.  The
motor will pull only the current it needs to sustain the load and could be
quick started with an outside battery source to achieve sufficient output to
begin producing current on its own.

DePalma and Tewari both note that they have never succeeded in folding the
output back to run the input.  However, it might work by feeding a battery
or a battery network which THEN runs the motor.

In a lengthy private discussion with Dr. Tewari, he told some of our group
that he had developed an AC Homopolar generator, but had been using the DC
Homopolar unit's high current output to generate hydrogen from water.  The
hydrogen gas was then burned for other uses.

We note that KeelyNetter Mike Randall reports voluminous hydrogen/oxygen
production (Brown's gas) using 30 amps at 2 volts in a 60 cycle pulsed mode.
Imagine what 1500 amps would yield.  Tewari is using direct current at low
voltage to produce his gases.

Experiment with it and see what you can come up with.  Just be very careful
when dealing with any circuits involving high currents or mercury!..>>> Jerry
