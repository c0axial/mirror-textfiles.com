                         ALL ABOUT "PHASE CONJUGATION"
                       October 18, 1993 by Rick Andersen

     Anyone  who  has  read  enough  about  Scalar  Electromagnetics,
     as described in Tom Bearden's books and papers, has noticed that
     since the late 1980's he has been emphasizing the importance of
     that mysterious phenomenon known as Phase Conjugation, or Time-
     Reversal of waves.  The old adage that, "The more you know, the
     more you realize you DON'T know", has proved true for me,  time
     and again-- which means that I was trying hard to understand
     what Bearden was saying but realized I needed to know more about
     the subject.  So I did some research on Phase Conjugation and
     found that, lo and behold, Tom wasn't dreaming this up-- you can
     find out all about it in any science encyclopedia under "Light",
     and I even found that my Radio Shack book on Lasers had a small
     section on it.  So I decided to put the information into this
     file for the benefit of other interested researchers who would
     like the scoop on the subject.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------
     The following description is borrowed in part from Radio Shack's
     LASER book, and in part gleaned from various science encyclopedias,
     with comments regarding Bearden's works on the subject.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------

     We start out with a narrow, point-like light source-- a laser--
     which produces a tight beam which stays tight (minimum diverging
     of the rays) for great distances.  But we know that, as narrow
     as our coherent laser beam is (in contrast to, say, a flashlight
     beam), it still DIVERGES perceptibly over distance (or over TIME,
     if we want to look at it that way, since distance is how far
     something travels over TIME).

     Now suppose we want to reflect our beam off a mirror directly
     facing the laser itself-- so that the beam is reflected exactly
     back at the laser.  Will we "re-capture" all of our tight beam?
     No, because the beam is still diverging in (positive) time, even
     after we've changed its direction of travel by reflecting it.

     There is an instrument designed to reflect such a laser beam back
     on itself: a Retroreflector.

                                    Page 1

     A Retroreflector is a double-mirror arrangement that sends light
     rays back in the direction that they came from-- that is, back
     to their point of origin.  But, being mirrors, although they reflect
     and change the DIRECTION of the ever-DIVERGING wavefront, the beam
     itself continues to diverge nonetheless, spreading out over time.

     Would it ever be possible to reflect the beam in such a way that
     all that diverging energy would CONVERGE again, somewhat like a
     reversal of ENTROPY?  Or like a reversed-TIME beam?

     PHASE CONJUGATION

     PHASE CONJUGATION is an operation that can be performed on light
     waves, so that they reflect back, like a Retroreflector, but with
     some unusual properties.  It generates what is called a "conjugate"
     of an incoming light wave.  Viewed on an X-Y graph, the conjugate
     of a positive angle, say, 45 degrees, is found by reversing the
     SIGN of the angle: i.e., -45 degrees.  Thus the positive angle in
     the first quadrant of the X-Y graph moves down into the 4th quadrant.
     (Remember the plastic Protractor you used in high school math?
     It had the first 2 quadrants, spanning 0 to 180 degrees.)

     Notice that if we increase an angle from 0 to 45 degrees, we open
     up the angle in a counterclockwise direction on the graph.  Start-
     ing at 0 and opening an angle to -45, the CONJUGATE angle, moves
     the angle arrow in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION, clockwise.

     The phase conjugate wave is essentially a reversed version of the
     original wave-- the wave is at the same phase and shape, travel-
     ling in the same path as the incoming wave, but in exactly the
     opposite direction.  The phase difference between any two points
     of the reversed wave has a sign opposite to that of the phase
     difference between the same points on the original wave.

     If the incoming light all came from a small laser spot, the phase-
     conjugate wave will return to that same spot.

     That may sound exactly like retroreflection.  However, it is
     actually a TIME-REVERSED version of the original wave, reconstruc-
     ting the light's phase and amplitude.  Because of the way the
     phase-conjugate wave recreates the original wave, it automatically
     compensates for things that happened to the laser beam om its trip
     from the laser out into the distance.

     Light diverging out from a source may experience distortions;
     the phase conjugate wave experiences the same distortions, but
     in the opposite direction, as if it is going backwards in time.
     Thus the spread-out light in the phase conjugate beam re-CONVERGES
     in focus on the light source.

     Physicists involved in nonlinear optics call this the "Distortion
     Correction Theorem".  It is actually Time-Reversal, as is pointed
     out by several writers.

     HISTORY OF THE PHENOMENON

     American scientists first learned about phase conjugation in the
     early 1970's.  Researchers at the P. N. Lebedev Physical Insti-


                                    Page 2

     tute, Moscow, U.S.S.R., led by Boris Ya Zel'dovich, had discovered
     an intriguing phenomenon in 1972:

     The scientists distorted an intense beam of red light from a
     pulsed ruby laser by directing it through a frosted glass pane.
     The distorted light was then sent down a long tube filled with
     methane gas under high pressure.  Interactions occurred between
     the beam and the molecules of the gas  (stimulated Brillouin
     scattering) and, acting as a mirror, the gas reflected the beam
     backward.  When the reflected light passed back through the same
     piece of frosted glass, a nearly perfect, undistorted optical
     beam emerged.

     The backward-traveling wave is, in essence, a time-reversed
     replica of the original incident wave.

     To explain by way of analogy, we might compare the retracing of
     light waves back through the distorting media as "running a
     movie backward".  As described by Shkunov and Zel'dovich:

      "The relation between the wave fronts of two mutually reversed
       waves is analogous to the relation between the positions of
       two opposing armies on a military map.  The front line of each
       army coincides with that of the other, and the directions of
       desirable movement are opposite.  One can say that the front
       lines are mutually reversed: a convex part of one's army front
       corresponds to a concave part of the other."

     Tom Bearden maintains that this Time Reversed wave carries with it
     all the magical properties one would expect of energy that is flow-
     ing BACKWARD IN TIME...

     HOW DO WE MAKE A PHASE CONJUGATE MIRROR?

     We need a NONLINEAR MEDIUM, that is, one in which waves do not
     simply linearly superpose (co-exist as if the other were not there),
     but MODULATE one another, which implies multiplication of amplitudes
     as well as the possible generation of harmonic frequencies.

     In optics this has been done by beaming high-powered laser light
     through certain gases (Bearden mentions IONIZED gas), possibly
     under pressure, as explained above.  Other examples of nonlinear
     materials are semiconductors, crystals, liquids, plasmas (ionized
     gases), liquid crystals, aerosols (as in the atmosphere), and
     atomic vapors.  The term NONLINEAR medium here means a medium
     that is altered or affected by light.  Linear materials are not
     affected, under usual conditions.

     The two techniques most used in the generation of phase-conjugate
     waves are "Stimulated Brillouin Scattering" and "Degenerative
     4-Wave Mixing" (the latter also mentioned by Bearden).  Both rely
     on the laser's ability to interact with the nonlinear optical
     properties of a specific medium.  When a material-- gas, liquid,
     or solid-- is penetrated by light of intensity great enough to
     compete with the atomic forces that bind the material together,
     the material is modified, as is also the light penetrating it.
     This nonlinear interaction generates the SBS or DFWM time-reversed
     waves.


                                    Page 3

     In SBS (Stimulated Brillouin Scattering), the modified material
     generates SOUND waves that serve as an appropriate reflective
     surface to produce the time-reversed waves.  (Traditionally, the
     frequency of scattered light has been regarded as identical to
     that of the incident light.  As is often the case, this is not
     true in actuality.  As first predicted by Brillouin in 1914,
     a slight line broadening occurs due to motion of the scatterers
     --Doppler effect-- and also due to variations in the directions
     or magnitudes of their polarizability tensors [due to chemical
     reactions].  The Brillouin effect, simply stated, is as follows:

       Upon the scattering of monochromatic radiation (light of one
       color or electromagnetic waves of one frequency), a DOUBLET is
       produced, in which the frequency of each of the two lines diff-
       ers from the frequency of the original line by the same amount,
       one having a higher frequency, and the other having a lower
       frequency.

     (Radio technicians will recognize a description of a CARRIER wave
     surrounded by an upper and lower SIDEBAND here...  Is there a
     hidden secret here as to how we might generate a phase-conjugate
     wave using  conventional radio transmission techniques??)

     In Degenerative 4-Wave Mixing, which Bearden describes in his
     books, the interaction uses a holographic process in a nonlinear
     material to generate the conjugate waves.  As Bearden describes
     it, two "pump" waves are beamed at one another through the non-
     linear medium.  The pump waves "lock" or modulate one another,
     producing Bearden's "Scalar Stress Wave".  Next, a 3rd, weaker
     beam is input into the system (at a 90 degree angle to the pump
     waves, if I understand him correctly), and this setup generates
     the Phase Conjugate wave which backtracks down the path taken by
     the 3rd wave, but at a greater intensity or amplitude than the
     weak, "tickler" 3rd wave.  Bearden cites the literature in saying
     that up to ALL the energy inputted to the system via the two
     "pump" waves can be transferred into the phase conjugate output
     wave-- and so a powerful, time-reversed wave can be produced from
     a relatively weak "tickler" input.  Of course, power still has
     to be put in at the pump waves-- but, says Bearden, what if we
     use the powerful and limitless Scalar Stresses of the fiery core
     of the Earth itself-- stimulated via Tesla-type resonance-- as
     our pump waves?  Then it would appear that we can input a tiny
     input wave and extract enormous Phase Conjugate energy out!

     But back to our description.


     While our scientists have been exploring the phenomena and tech-
     niques for producing phase conjugated waves in the OPTICAL freq-
     uencies, Tom Bearden asserts that the Soviets (and perhaps the
     Germans before them, during WW2) have developed the technology at
     MICROWAVE and RADAR frequencies.  Here the effect is probably
     generated by means of certain solid (not gaseous) materials
     and/or crystalline substances (Bearden refers to them as RAM--
     Radar Absorbent Materials.)  Think on this a while and you'll see
     the tremendous potential for Star-Wars-type directed energy beam
     weapons...

     Bearden also points out that the equations imply that Phase Conj-

                                    Page 4

     ugation is a general phenomenon, occurring in all types of waves,
     not just electromagnetic.  Even sound waves, which are Longitudinal
     or Compression/Rarefaction waves in the density of air molecules,
     can be and evidently have been phase conjugated to produced "acou-
     stic missiles" which CONVERGE on their targets and blast them with
     the full energy that they had when they were first generated.

     On the stranger end of the spectrum, we have the possibility for
     Time-Reversal effects on the local area and/or in biological
     systems (like people).  Bearden forsees a time when electromag-
     netic healing will be used on a large scale, in which future
     physicians will irradiate the patient with time-reversed EM
     "disease signatures" or patterns; the reversal transforms them
     into HEALING patterns in the same way that our laser beam was
     distortion-corrected by sending its phase conjugate pattern back
     down the distortion path.  Perhaps even AGING may be reversed in
     this way... or the flow of Time itself...

     This may be the beginning of the Engineering of Reality itself!
