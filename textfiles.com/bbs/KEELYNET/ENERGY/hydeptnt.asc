                                    ABSTRACT

          Externally charged electrodes of an electrostatic generator
       induce charges of opposite polarity on segments of a pair of
       confronting stators by means of electric fields within which a pair
       of rotors are confined during rotation to vary the charge binding
       field linkages between confronting rotors and stators by a shielding
       action of the rotors in a plane perpendicular to the field flux.  A
       high electric potential difference induced between the stators
       resulting from such rotation of the rotors, is transformed by an
       output circuit into a reduced DC voltage applied to a load with a
       correspondingly increase current conducted therethrough.

               ELECTROSTATIC ENERGY FIELD POWER GENERATING SYSTEM

       BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

          This invention relates to the generation of electrical power by
       conversion of energy from an electrostatic field.  The conversion of
       energy from a static electric field into useful electrical energy by
       means of an electrostatic generator is already well known in the art
       as exemplified by the disclosures in U.S. Pat Nos. 2,522,106,
       3,013,201, 4,127,804, 4,151,409, and 4,595,852.  Generally, the
       energy conversion process associated with such prior art electro-
       static generators involves the input of mechanical energy to
       separate charges so that a considerable portion of the output is
       derived from the conversion of mechanical energy.  It is therefore an
       important object of the present invention to provide an electro-
       static generator in which electrical power is derived from the
       energy of static electric field with minimized input of mechanical
       power.

       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

          In accordance with the present invention, static electric fields
       are established between electrodes externally maintained at charge
       levels of opposite polarity and a pair of internal stator discs
       having segmental surfaces that are dielectrically spaced to confine
       thereon charges induced by the electric fields.  A pair of rotor
       discs are rotated within continuous electric fields in planes
       perpendicular to the field flux to locationally vary the charge
       linkage established by the electric fields between the electrodes
       and stator discs.  Such changes in charge linkage are effected by
       rotation of electrically conductive segments of the rotor angularly
       spaced from each other to partially shield the stator discs from the
       electric fields.  The segments of each rotor disc have charged faces
       confronting the electrodes in its field to shield the stator disc
       over a total face area that is one-half the total area of the
       confronting segment surfaces on the stator disc to which the induced
       charges are confined.  Charges on the rotors and stators are
       equalized by electrical interconnections established through the
       rotor shafts.  The stator discs are electrically interconnected with
       an electrical load through an output circuit transforming a high
       potential between the stator discs into a reduced DC voltage to
       conduct a correspondingly multiplied current through the load.

       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT

          Referring now to the drawings in detail, FIG. 1 diagrammatically
       depicts the energy conversion system of the present invention
       generally referred to by reference numeral 10.  As diagrammed in FIG.
       1, the system includes a pair of electrostatic fields 12 and 14
       established by electrostatic charges of opposite polarity applied to
       electrode plates 16 and 18 from some external energy source.  Thus,
       the electrostatic field 12 is established between electrode 16 and a
       stator disc 20 while the electrostatic field 14 is established
       between electrode 18 and a stator disc 22.  In accordance with the
       present invention, electrostatic charge linkages established by the
       flux of the fields between the electrodes and stators are
       periodically varied by displacement within continuous energy fields
       12 and 14 in response to rotation of their common rotational axis
       and the field flux as will be hereinafter described.  The rotors are
       mechanically interconnected with an electric motor 28, as diagram-
       matically illustrated in FIG. 1, for rotation about the common
       rotational axis.  Electrical energy may be extracted from the
       electric fields 12 and 14 during rotation of the rotors 24 and 26 by
       motor 28 through an output circuit generally referred to by
       reference numeral 30.  The output circuit 30 as shown, in FIG. 1 in a
       simplified fashion, includes two pair of current conducting diodes
       32A, 32B, 34A, and 34B.  The diodes of each pair are oppositely poled
       and each pair is connected in parallel to one of the stators 20 and
       22.  The diodes of each pair are also electrically connected across
       an electrical load represented by resistors 36A and 36B with
       capacitor networks 38A and 38B interconnected between each pair of
       diodes by means of which the voltage potential between the stators
       20 and 22 is reduced in favor of an increased current through the
       electrical load.





                                   - Page 3 -

          Referring now to FIGS. 2, 3 and 4 in particular, a physical
       embodiment of the energy conversion system diagrammed in FIG. 1 is
       shown.  The electrodes 16 and 18 are in the form of circular plates
       or discs made of an electrically conductive metal having external
       surfaces 40 and 42 adapted to be charged from the external source as
       aforementioned.  The internal surface 44 of electrode 18 is thereby
       adapted to maintain a positive charge opposite in polarity to the
       negative charge of the electrode 16 which is maintained in a stable
       ion form within a dielectric surface portion 46 of the electrode 16.
       The energy conversion system may be enclosed within an outer housing
       48 to which the electrodes 16 and 18 are secured.

          With continued reference to FIG. 2, the stators 20 and 22 mounted
       by housing 48 in axially fixed spaced relation to the electrodes 16
       and 18 are provided with bearings 50 and 52 establishing the afore-
       mentioned common rotational rotor axis journaling a powered shaft
       assembly having electrically conductive shaft sections 54 and 56 to
       which the rotors 24 and 26 are respectively connected. In the
       embodiment illustrated in FIG. 2, the drive motor 28 is mechanically
       interconnected with the shaft sections 54 and 56 through an
       electrically nonconductive shaft section 58 of the power shaft
       assembly for simultaneous rotation of both rotors 24 and 26 at the
       same speed and in the same direction about the common rotational
       axis perpendicular to parallel spaced planes with which the
       electrode and stator discs are aligned.  The electrically conductive
       shaft sections 54 and 56 are respectively keyed or secured in any
       suitable fashion to hub portions 60 and 62 or the rotors and are
       provided with flange portions 64 and 66 forming electrical wipers in
       contact with confronting surfaces of the stators 20 and 22, which
       are inductively charged by the static electric fields 12 and 14 to
       equal levels of opposite polarity.

          As more clearly seen in FIGS. 2 and 3, the rotor 24 has a
       plurality of angularly spaced, field linkage controlling segments 68
       projecting radially outwardly from the hub portion 60.  Each rotor
       segment 68 is made of an electrically conductive metal having a face
       70 on one axial side confronting the adjacent electrode 16.  The
       faces 70 confronting the electrode 16 are charged positively by the
       electric field 12 extending between the dielectric surface portion
       46 of electrode 16 and the stator disc 20.  While the electric field
       12 projects through the spaces 72 between the rotor segments 68, the
       rotor segments 68 themselves shield portions of the stator disc 20
       from the electric field.

          The rotor 26 is similarly formed with rotor segments 74 angularly
       spaced from each other by spaces 76 through which the electric field
       14 extends between the positively charged surface 44 of electrode 18
       and the stator 22.  The rotor segments 74 of rotor 26 as shown in
       FIG. 2, are provided with dielectric surface portions 78 confronting
       the internally charged surface 44 of electrode 18.  While the rotor
       segments 74 are negatively charged by the electric field 14 within
       the surface portions 78, they also shield portions of the stator
       disc 22 from the electric field as in the case of the rotor segments
       68 hereinbefore described.  The internal dielectric surface portion
       46 of electrode 16 and dielectric surface portions 78 of rotor 26
       act as a stabilizer to prevent eddy currents and leakage of negative
       charge.  Further, in view of the electrical connections established
       between the rotors and the stator discs, the charge on each stator
       is equalized with that of the charge on its associated rotor.

                                   - Page 4 -

          As shown in FIGS. 2 and 4, the stator disc 20 includes a
       plurality of segments 82 to which charges are confined, closely
       spaced from each other by dielectric spacers 80.  The segments 82 are
       electrically interconnected with the rotor segments 68 through rotor
       shaft section 54.  Similarly, the segments 84 of the stator 22 are
       electrically interconnected with the rotor segments 74 through rotor
       shaft section 56. The stator segments 82 and 84 are therefore also
       made of electrically conductive metal.  Each of the segments 82 of
       stator 20 is electrically interconnected through the output circuit
       30 with each of the segments 84 of the stator.  The stator discs
       being fixedly mounted within the housing 48, centrally mount the
       bearings 50 and 52 through which the electrically nonconductive
       motor shaft section 58 is journaled as shown in the embodiment of
       the invention illustrated in FIG. 2. Further, the total area of the
       charged segment surfaces on each of the stator discs is greater than
       the total area of the faces 70 or 78 on the segments of each
       associated rotor disc 24 or 26.  According to one embodiment, the
       total charged stator surface area is twice that of the rotor face
       area.

          According to the embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG.
       6, the output circuit 30 includes the two oppositely poled
       capacitive circuit networks 38A and 38B connected across each
       aligned pair of stator segments 82 and 84 on the stators 20 and 22
       by means of the oppositely poled diodes 32A and 34A.  Each of such
       capacitive circuit networks includes a capacitor 86, the opposite
       sides of which are connected by oppositely poled diodes 88 and 90 to
       positive and negative load terminals 92 and 94 across which a
       suitable electrical voltage is established for operating an
       electrical load.  The diode 88 is connected to the junction 102
       between diode 104 and one side of capacitor 106.  The diode 88 is
       also connected to the junction between one side of capacitor 100 and
       the diode 32A.  The diode 90, on the other hand, is interconnected
       with the junction 96 between diode 108 and capacitor 100.  Also,
       diode 90 is connected to the junction between the other side of
       capacitor 106 and the diode 34A.  The foregoing circuit arrangement
       of capacitive network 38A is the same as that of network 38B by
       means of which aligned pairs of the stator segments 82 and 84 have
       the electrical potentials therebetween transformed into a lower
       voltage across the load terminals 92 and 94 to conduct a higher load
       current.

          FIG. 5A illustrates the distribution of charges established in
       the electric fields 12 and 14 between the electrodes and stators
       under static conditions in which each of the rotor segments 68 and
       74 is positioned in alignment with one of the stator segments 82 and
       84 to thereby shield alternate stator segments from the electric
       fields.  The charges established by the electric fields are therefore
       confined to the faces of alternate stator segments confronting the
       electrodes and are equalized with the charges established on and
       confined to the shielding faces of the rotor segments confronting
       the electrodes by virtue of the electrical interconnection between
       the rotors and stators as aforementioned.  As depicted in FIG. 5B,
       when rotation is imparted to the rotors, the charge linkages
       established by the electric fields between the electrodes and
       alternate stator segments 82 or 84 are interrupted by the moving
       rotor segments 68 or 74 so that previously shield stator segments
       become exposed to the fields to reestablish field energy linkages


                                   - Page 5 -

       with the associated electrodes.  Such action causes electrical
       potentials to be established between the stator segments 82 and 84.

          It will be apparent from the foregoing description that the
       electrostatic energy fields 12 and 14 of opposite polarity are
       established maintained between the externally charged electrodes 16
       and 18 and the internally charged stators 20 and 22 under static
       conditions as depicted in FIG. 5A. During rotation, the rotors 24
       and 26 continuously disposed within such energy fields 12 and 14,
       exert forces in directions perpendicular to the field flux
       representing the energy linkages between electrodes and stators to
       cause interruptions and reestablishment of energy linkages with
       portions of different stator segments as depicted in FIG 5B.  Such
       energy linkage locational changes and the charge binding and
       unbinding actions between electrodes and stators creates an
       electrical potential and current to flow between stators through the
       output circuit 30.  Thus, the output circuit when loaded extracts
       energy from the electric fields 12 and 14 as a result of the field
       linkage charge binding and unbinding actions induced by rotation of
       the rotors.  The stator segments 82 and 84 shielded from the electric
       fields by the moving rotor segments 68 and 74 as depicted in FIG.
       5B, have electric potentials of polarity opposite to those of the
       external electrodes 16 and 18 because of the field linkage charge
       unbinding action.  Previously shielded stator segments being exposed
       to the electric fields by the moving rotor segments, have the same
       electric potential polarity as those of the external electrodes
       because of field linkage binding action.  Since the forces exerted on
       the respective rotors by the electric fields 12 and 14 of opposite
       polarity act on the common rotor shaft assembly perpendicular to
       said fields, such forces cancel each other.  The energy input to the
       system may therefore be substantially limited to mechanical bearing
       losses and windage during conversion of electrostatic field energy
       to electrical energy as well as electrical resistance losses and
       other electrical losses encountered in the output circuit 30.

          Based upon the foregoing operational characteristics, rotation of
       the rotors in accordance with the present invention does not perform
       any substantial work against the external electric fields 12 and 14
       since there is no net change in capacitance thereby enabling the
       system to convert energy with a reduced input of mechanical energy
       and high efficiency, as evidenced by minimal loss of charge on the
       electrodes.  It was therefore found that working embodiments of the
       present invention require less than ten percent of the electrical
       output energy for the mechanical input.  Further, according to one
       prototype model of the invention, a relatively high output voltage
       of 300,000 volts was obtained across the stators.  By reason of such
       high voltage, an output circuit 30 having a voltage reducing and
       current multiplying attribute as hereinbefore described was
       selected so as to render the system suitable for many practical
       applications.

          The foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the
       principles of the invention.  Further since numerous modifications
       and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is
       not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and
       operation shown and described, and, accordingly, all suitable
       modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the
       scope of the invention.
