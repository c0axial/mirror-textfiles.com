The following messages relate to the formation of small ball lightning globes.

It is the first time I've seen anything about this phenomenon since we first
saw it back in 1988, while doing a lightning show (ZAP-DALLAS).  While bolts
of electricity stream off the arms, I had noticed small yellowish globes about
1/4" in diameter which appeared above the skin and flowed with the streaming
electricity.  This only occurred around 800,000 Volts or higher.

Since sodium fluoresces yellowish orange, it seemed likely these small spheres
originated from salt.  Part of the show required a saturated salt spray to be
sprayed onto the feet and a metal plate to enhance conductivity.  Distilled
water was sprayed on the head to keep the hair from catching on fire.

In an attempt to track the source of the spheres down, we took great pains
that no salt water was allowed anywhere near the arms.  It did not matter, as
the spheres still appeared.  We finally concluded it must be body salts that
were being carried to the surface of the skin due to iontophoresis.  This is
probably not the final answer, but is the closest we could get to an
explanation.  .GIF images are available as ZAP1, ZAP2 AND ZAP3.  We could
never get a picture of the spheres because of lighting and proximity problems.

I have been posting articles about tiny ball lightning and plasmoids for a
while now.  In a letter to the Editor in the December, 1994 issue of FUSION
TECHNOLOGY, Matsumoto reports about the observation of tiny ball lightning in
several cold fusion experiments, and he suggests that people use nuclear
emulsions.  He's written manuscripts about tiny ball lightning that are
produced by discharge apparatus also.  Sufficient evidence of the production
of things that can be called "plasmoids" or tiny ball lightning is the many
kinds of plasmoid traces that Matsumoto has produced, and the EB-filament
paper by Nardi and Bostick et al.: V. Nardi, W. H.  Bostick, J. Feugeas, and
W. Prior, "Internal Structure of ELectron-Beam Filaments," Physical Review A,
22, no. 5, 2211 (November, 1980).  This is substantial proof, in my opinion.
Some of the ring traces are very similar, and some of the other traces are
similar too.  I'd also like to suggest that people use nuclear emulsions awith
various kinds of cold fusion and plasmoid experiments.  Many of the plasmoids
produced by electrolysis and discharge are the same.  And people have known
for a long time that plasmoids and discharges are associated with neutron
production.  They are the locus of neutron production.

I've posted versions of this article several times on this newsgroup since
December of 1993; and I've posted several articles about plasmoids and cold
fusion on this newsgroup since January of 1993.  If anyone wants to reproduce

                        PLASMOIDS AND COLD FUSION

W. Bostick produced that which he called plasmoids by discharging through
electrodes.  Bostick wrote a paper that was titled "Plasmoids" that was
published in SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN in 1957(1).  He may have been the first to
apply this term to this phenomena.  According to Peratt, Bostick coined the
term  In this paper, he had already began to tell others about his speculation
that galaxies and the phenomena he produced were similar.  He compared the
shapes and the travel of these things.  He also speculated a little about the
identity of "particles."  He shows pictures of different kinds of plasmoid
shapes in the article and related these to different kinds of shapes of
galaxies.  Many people including Bostick, Alfven who is a physics Nobel Prize
winner, Peratt and Lerner have developed similar astronomical theories that
model the universe as plasmoids and that can be said to be derivations or
summarizations of the experimental work of W. Bostick and others.  It has
become evident that atoms can be defined as plasmoids, especially as according
to the phenomena produced by Ken Shoulders.  It seems that there are many
different kinds of plasmoid phenomena.  The EVs that Ken Shoulders produced
and ball lightning may be classified as kinds of this general phenomena.
There is evidence that both plasmoids and ball lightning are associated with
neutrons, radioactivity, production of elements, and excess radiation, and
that they are a locus of this.

Based on the phenomena that Matsumoto produced, the traces, the pictures and
descriptions of electrodes, the pictures of stationary BL and corona-like
phenomena, the visible BL-like phenomena that he reports, and the sparks that
he observed that left traces like those produced during electrolysis and
discharge, one may categorize CF phenomena as tiny ball-lightning or
plasmoids.  Important evidence is the holes and trails on and in emulsions and
electrodes that Matsumoto produced by discharging and electrolysis, the holes
in electrodes that Liaw et al. produced, the holes in electrodes that others
produced, the empty areas in electrodes that are shaped liked grains that
Matsumoto and Silver et al. produced and the half-empty grains that Matsumoto
produced, and the holes and tunnels and trails on and in electrodes that
Silver produced.  The tunnels, round holes, and trail-like marks are similar
to those that are produced by ball lightning phenomena, though ball lightning
are associated with bigger effects.  These tunnels, round holes, and trail-
like marks are also similar to those produced by the EV phenomena that K.
Shoulders produced.  Silver and his co-authors who published a paper in the
December, 1993 issue of FUSION TECHNOLOGY have reproduced the tunnels, holes,
and trail-like markings in metals that Matsumoto produced.  These tunnels,
holes, and trail-marks are evidence of the conversion and change of materials.
Important evidence that both CF phenomena and substance in general are
plasmoid phenomena is Matsumoto's experience of the production of electricity
by apparatus.  I suspect that plasmoid phenomena such as electrodes and other
materials may convert to be bigger plasmoids and light and electricity.  EVs
and ball lightning are known to convert to light and electricity.  I think
that all substance can be identified as plasmoid phenomena.

I suspect that the round holes in electrodes that Matsumoto produced and the
round holes and tunnels that Silver produced are due to the boring of BL-like
phenomena -- the substance was converted to light, electricity or other kinds
of plasmoids, I suspect.  And I suspect that the grain-shaped voids or pits
that they produced is evidence of the conversion of the grain to light or
electricity or of the production of other kinds of plasmoids, though there may
also be the distortion of the grains or the dislocation of grains by
separation.  Some plasmoids are apparently able to travel through materials,
even if the plasmoids are very big.  The plasmoids that Matsumoto has produced
does this, and this is major evidence to support my deductions.  Matsumoto has
also shown pictures of sectioned electrodes with what seem to me to be trail-
like tracks, as if tiny BL-like phenomena traveled inside and left tracks.

Many other anomalous phenomena can be described as plasmoid phenomena.  For
example, superconductivity seem to be similar to the phenomena of ball
lightning traveling though materials such as ceramics and glass without
leaving holes or visible effects, yet ball lightning may convert to an
electrical surge after touching a wire or it may convert to a bolt of
lightning.  Also, sonoluminescence seems to be a phenomena of the water
converting to light and perhaps electricity.

You may be interested in an experiment that I conducted in 1982.  While
stimulating water vapor (H 2 O) with a high voltage source I witnessed
something that may be relevant to your post.

I called it the production of active plasma, but you may call it tiny ball
lighting. The water vapor was in a pyrex 1000ml beaker into which electrodes
were installed.

Moments after the power was introduced a very bright -ball- of plasma appeared
in the beaker. This ball then adhered to the inside wall of the beaker. Within
seconds this -ball-melted a tiny pinhole at the point of contact. The -ball-
then

(I guess oozed is a good word) through this tiny hole. The -ball-followed a
spiral path around the room (I dove for the floor by the way) and after about
70 seconds disapeared.

The recent miniature ball lightning discussion took me back to my early teens
when I was an enthusiastic but illegal pirate radio operator together with a
few of my friends.  One of the things we used to try to do was to develop
antenna tuning units that would manage to get very short lengths of wire to
act as a transmitting antenna.  The RF voltages on the antenna were very high
and I often got very painful RF arcs to the skin of my hand, accompanied by
the unmistakable smell of roast human!

The interesting thing is that 2 or 3 times when I got an RF arc to a piece of
surrounding metalwork I saw a miniature spherical orange/yellow ball detach
itself from the arc and travel in a zig-zag path for perhaps a couple of
seconds.

As it travelled it made a sizzling noise with small 'firework sparkler' type
bits coming out of it.  The ball could only have been 1 or 2mm in diameter.  I
guess these things might also have been of the same form as ball lightning.

Has anybody else noticed anything like this?
