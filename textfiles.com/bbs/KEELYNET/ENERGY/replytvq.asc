       An open letter to Mr. T.E. Bearden, and his readers, from members of
       the TVQ group:

       Mr. Bearden;

       I am writing  to  you  as  a  representative  of  a private research
       collective which has  been  studying   scalar  Electromagnetics  for
       several years.  Members  of this group, myself included,  have  read
       many of your   publications   with  great  interest.   I  personally
       consider your "Toward  a  New  Electromagnetics"   series   required
       reading for any rational approach to the subject.

       I was sent a copy of your latest documents downloaded  from KeelyNet
       by a fellow  member  who  had  some  difficulty  with  the  material
       presented.  Not having been aware  of  these  files,  I eagerly read
       them, but find that I must take issue with several  points mentioned
       in the "Secret to Free Energy" papers.

       First let me  state  my point of view.  I believe in quantum vacuum,
       virtual particles, and over-unity  systems.  I  do  not  believe  in
       electromagnetic waves in a vacuum.  I am an engineer  by  trade, and
       have been successfully  designing  and building scalar equipment for
       several years.  I   was   introduced    (reluctantly)    to   scalar
       electromagnetics by a researcher whom had come across  your  earlier
       papers as well  as  those  of  Eike  Mueller.   After  some  initial
       tinkering, I was rewarded with "interesting" results.

       From that time  our  group  has   grown,   as   has  our  collective
       experience.  We are about to publish our first in a  series of books
       on practical scalar   engineering   which   will   include  detailed
       diagrams, parts lists, and other  construction  details  for several
       scalar devices.  Before we release this publication,  we  would like
       you to review  the  designs of the devices we intend to present.  We
       wish to end  the  drought  of  practical   information   on   scalar
       electromagnetics, and in  that  light  we  must  address  your  last
       papers.

       The statement "Electromagnetic energy is any ordering, either static
       or dynamic, in the virtual photon flux of vacuum." is flawed.  Radio
       static and quantum noise are both clearly electromagnetic, but not

                                      Page 1





       ordered.  Both represent   a  potential,  and  have  "energy".   For
       example, the radio  engineers nightmare:  the  transmitter  is  only
       putting out 10 watts of signal, but 2000 watts of noise.

       The definition you present would preclude the existence of wide band
       "natural scalar potentials", which are necessary  for  some  of  the
       applications mentioned in  the "Secret to Free Energy" papers.  This
       is the key  to  the "electronic smog"  problems  as  well  as  other
       equally rewarding applications.

       More confusing is  the  incomplete definition of scalar  and  vector
       potentials as being  static  or  dynamic  respectively.  A conductor
       (transmission line) with two electromagnetic standing waves in phase
       is clearly a vector case.  Pick almost  any  two  points  along that
       line (except two zero crossings) and you will find  a  difference of
       potential, which is  voltage.   This is still a static case, in that
       the waves are stationary with respect to the observer.

       Take the same conductor and place two equal electromagnetic standing
       waves, 180 degrees out of phase, on  the line.  There will no longer
       be any difference in potential between any two points,  but  this is
       still a static  case.  Scalar waves may be static standing waves, or
       a dynamic "scalar  current".  The  distinction  between  scalar  and
       vector is not simply the difference between the static  and  dynamic
       cases.  The difference  is  simply  the  geometry  of  the potential
       vectors which comprise the wave or potential.

       The definitions presented in this  latest paper appear to be at odds
       with those in your earlier papers.  This is minor in comparison with
       the grossly incorrect definition of voltage presented.   Voltage  is
       the difference in  electrostatic  potential  between  two  points in
       space, nothing more or less.  Voltage  does  not  therefore  mandate
       current, which is the "dissipation of potential".   This  definition
       works equally well  in  the  electrostatic  case  as  in  the vector
       electric current (dynamic) case.

       With conventional equipment, we measure this difference in potential
       by placing a  known  impedance across  the  potential  (vector)  and
       measuring the resulting  current  flow.   This  is   a   matter   of
       implementation, not physical law, and not the true nature of voltage
       in the electrostatic case.

       As for the   design  of  the  theoretical  power  generation  system
       discussed, there are  several critical  flaws.   First  is  the  two
       circuit, two cycle  system  as  described.  If we have  a  practical
       collector component to  which  we may apply an electrostatic charge,
       and extract a "current free potential",  then  there  is  no need to
       switch the source of charge onto and off of the "collector", and we
       can eliminate one circuit and the critical timing.

       It is further stated that the "collector" proposed in the papers may
       be a coil  or  capacitor.  If a capacitor were to be  used,  current
       would be maximum just after the switch closed, and this would negate
       any over-unity operation.   With an ideal inductor, current would be
       zero as the  switch is closed.  This  is  rather  critical  for  any
       practical implementation.

       Such a practical  collector  exists,  and  we  are   taught  how  to
       construct it by reading "Toward a New Electromagnetics, Part 4. On

                                      Page 2





       page 19, slide  38,  we  find just such a device.  This is a virtual
       particle collector.  As presented this device will function, but not
       optimally.

       A truly practical virtual particle  collector  would be cylindrical,
       not spherical, to increase the total charge available  to the center
       conductor.  This modification  also  provides  us  with  ready  made
       virtual particle collectors in the  form  of  coaxial cable.  We can
       understand this by  examining  the  construction   of   a  practical
       example.

       We begin by  stripping  off the outside copper braid and leaving the
       inner conductor intact at one end  of a length of coaxial cable.  We
       then push the braid back and cut the inner conductor at the opposite
       end of the cable.

       The inner conductor  is  insulated,  and the braid  is  then  pulled
       forward closing the  braid  over  the  insulated  end  of  the inner
       conductor.  We can now charge the  braid,  and extract a charge free
       potential from the inner conductor at the other end of the cable.

       Even with this  virtual  particle  collector,  Bearden's  two  cycle
       system is still  needed.  The virtual particles must be gated into a
       translator, to excite the atoms of the translation matrix.

       In the second cycle, the switch opens removing the virtual particles
       from the translation matrix, allowing  the  atoms  to  drop  back to
       their rest states and emitting a real photon for us  to  keep by the
       process of exophoton emission.

       In this system  we can simplify the second circuit by placing a high
       impedance load directly  across the  translation  matrix.  The  only
       switching needed now is a single virtual particle flux  switch.  The
       only penalty for   this  is  that  we  must  insure  that  we  don't
       annihilate particle-antiparticle pairs  inside our load impedance as
       this would cause circuit failure.

       If this switch appears to be a problem, remember  that  the  virtual
       particle flux will  flow  through  conductors  just  like  a  vector
       current.  The only  difference is  whether  the  motion  is  in  the
       electron cloud or the electron cloud's virtual particle flux.

       Use a switch,  like a reed relay.  The timing of such  a  system  is
       much less demanding, and the circuit configuration simpler than that
       of the system described in the papers.

       If we want  to  get  high  tech without resorting to mixing up doped
       conductors, we could build virtual particle collectors which utilize
       permanently polarized dialectrics and thereby eliminate the need for
       the charge pump needed to put the  real particles onto the collector
       in the first place.  All we have to do now is run the switch.

       In the additional comments to the papers "The Final  Secret for Free
       Energy" reference is  made  to the Floyd Sweet Vacuum Triode.  After
       reading some of  the  material on  this  device,  I  was  personally
       impressed due to the description of the "programming" process of the
       device for the correct frequency of operation.  No  details  of  the
       construction or programming  of  this  device have been uncovered by
       any member of our group.

                                      Page 3





       This process is familiar to members of our group, as the translation
       matrix must be  "programmed"  in  like  manner  for use in the power
       generation system we describe here.

       As the translation matrix used in  our  system  is  often  a gas, we
       apply a DC bias to the gas, and a scalar current is  then  impressed
       onto the DC bias.  By ionizing the gas in this manner we can get the
       electrons out of  the  way of the nucleus, and thus allow the scalar
       current direct access to the nucleons themselves.  This bypasses the
       process of quantum screening of the nucleus by the electron cloud of
       non-ionized matter.

       We know of no equivalent process  for  magnetic  materials, and this
       casts some doubt  on  the  validity of the Sweet Vacuum  Triode.   A
       member of the  group  obtained  a  video  tape  of  this  device  in
       operation.  This tape showed several disturbing things.

       First was the demonstration of the  magnets  placed  on the color TV
       screen.  The colorful  displays  produced  only   tell   us  of  the
       magnetization of the  shadow  mask  within the cathode ray tube, and
       not much of the fields producing that magnetization.

       Second was that the load received power immediately after the signal
       generator was turned on.  The signal  generator  in  question  was a
       Hewlett Packard vacuum tube device, and will not output a signal for
       several seconds after power is applied.

       The "beam" emitted  from the quartz-halogen lamp was  the  clincher.
       The effect is  clearly  the  result of saturating the charge coupled
       image pickup device in the video  recorder  used.   Until  these and
       other concerns are  addressed,  I must consider this  device  smoke,
       mirrors and vaporware.  Check for a ground fault somewhere.

       There are two  methods of power generation described near the end of
       the papers, as well as the undesirable  effects attributed to one of
       the two methods.  Here again we must take issue, the  "time reversed
       effects" described are  not  the  result  of using one method or the
       other, but are due to a more subtle cause.

       The first of  the  two  methods  is  best  summarized  as  exophoton
       emission, and is the process attributed to the Sweet  Vacuum Triode.
       It is a   revamped  version  of  the  good  old  exophoton  emission
       phenomenon from modern quantum physics,  but wrapped in the terms of
       quantum optical theory.   This  basic process occurs  constantly  in
       nature without the need for any macroscopic reversed time effects.

       The second method   presented   is   incomplete,   as  there  is  no
       translation process to take the virtual  particle flux and translate
       it into photon flux, but we have already gone the  long  way  around
       the barn with the flaws in that one.

       The cause of  the  "reversed  time  effects" is due to another basic
       principal we should   have  learned   from   the   "Toward   a   New
       Electromagnetics" series.  Scalar  resonance  will   flow  along  an
       electrostatic gradient.  If  the system we construct is not balanced
       electrostatically, different parts   of  the  system  will  take  on
       differing charges of this scalar resonance, and choke off the over-
       unity output.  It  is  this  process  which  makes  most  over-unity
       designs impractical.

                                      Page 4





       In quantum physics,  there is a law of conservation which quarks and
       leptons must obey, which states that  these  particles  must only be
       created or destroyed in particle-antiparticle pairs.   Electrons are
       leptons, and therefore  must  obey  this law.  This forces us to use
       two virtual particle   collectors,    and    in    so    doing    we
       electrostatically balance the system and avoid any unpleasant side
       effects.

       Any "free energy" system which causes a resistive load  to  run cold
       is malfunctioning and should be shut down immediately as a matter of
       safety.  Just try  to  keep warm with one and you will see the point
       here.  The goal is to provide pure  vector  power to the load.  If a
       resistive load runs cold, or cooler than when run with  conventional
       power sources, then the translation process is suspect.

       If we pollute  the  space-time that our virtual lepton fed generator
       is operating in with lots of unhappy  virtual antileptons, something
       is going to  give.   This must be avoided.  The virtual  antileptons
       will pinch off the flow of virtual leptons and the system will stop,
       or suffer performance degradation at least.

       As far as  good  conductors  being the bane of over unity inventors,
       surely you're joking, Mr. Bearden.  How could you possibly recommend
       constructing any scalar system with  less  than  perfect  materials?
       Should a circuit connection or component fail while  a  large scalar
       resonance charge is  present, the consequences could be most severe.
       This scenario has already been explored  in  earlier  papers  on the
       subject.

       If the current  dearth  of  practical how-to information  on  scalar
       technology is any  indication  of the level of effort being expended
       on this subject,  then we are in  most  serious  trouble.   I  would
       prefer to believe that there are accomplished researchers  who,  for
       whatever reasons, are not sharing their results.

       In that hope, our group has collectively decided to put our cards on
       the table in order to stimulate cooperative collaboration.

       It should be    clear   that   in   the   current   situation,   the
       commercialization of scalar technology  is  impractical.   This will
       continue to be the case until we begin to build on  the  foundations
       of others' work,  with  a  common  set  of  terms,  just  as  in the
       beginnings of our current electromagnetic technologies.

       We would treasure an opportunity to discuss the details of these and
       other systems with you, or any other  readers  before  we commit our
       manuscript to print.   Our  current  plan  is  to put  the  detailed
       construction plans for the power generation system we have described
       here in the  second  volume  of our books.  If we create the desired
       effect with the publication of  the  first  book,  then  it  may  be
       released as a free supplement to the first book.

       In closing, we would like to offer you (and everyone  else who reads
       this) the opportunity  to  discuss  these issues at length.  You may
       contact the group (TVQ) through our liazon here on KeelyNet.

                                                             All the Best,

       Vangard note...

          As usual, Joe and the TVQ group will NO DOUBT stir up quite a lot
          of interest  ESPECIALLY  if  they  come  out with a book or other
          practical circuits that will allow  anyone  to build and test the
          scalar and F/E principles.

          The idea  of  using  a BALANCED set of virtual collectors  is  an
          interesting approach  to cancelling out the alleged EM SMOG which
          is generated in the vicinity of a hyperspatial F/E generator.  We
          had assumed  Bearden  was  thinking   of   using   phasing,  i.e.
          enharmonic or destructive intereference to rid the  local area of
          noxious emissions.

          In a  way, the balanced set correlates with the TESTATIKA machine
          since it uses two of everything and is based on the "respiration"
          of energy in the universe.  That  is,  everything "breathes" in a
          continual in and out motion.  By properly tapping this motion, in
          either direction, energy can thus be "tapped".

          And, the  higher  order  researchers such as John  Keely,  Walter
          Russell and  Victor  Schauberger  (for  starters) understood this
          universal respiration cycle and  that  it  could  be tapped for a
          "hot/focussing" or "cold/expanding" effect in matter or energy.

          In the case of the EM SMOG cancellation using  the  dual  virtual
          collectors, it appears to be tapped for the positive and negative
          flows, thus  naturally  achieving  an  "undisturbed environment".
          The essence of true ecology.

          We here at KeelyNet are most interested  in  this approach to the
          generation of  free  energy  and  everyone will be  slavering  in
          anticipation of  the  comments and other responses...come on Joe,
          send us some circuits.....don't tease...
