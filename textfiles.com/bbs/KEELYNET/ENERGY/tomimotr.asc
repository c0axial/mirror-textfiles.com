PM_Square enhanced : The new free energy generation device !
============================================================

Latest news:
------------

1. MPEG movie now available at:

194.77.35.1   in pub/harti/energy/PM_Square/pm_sqlin.mpg    about 485 KBytes.
Shows, how the Linear Mode works with multiple stator tracks !
Could be used to propel a train along a railway !


2. A new Enhanced Linear version shown down there !

=====================================================================

Hi,

do you remember the TOMI (also called TMI) device ?

Well, I have worked together with the inventor and another "magnet freak"
during the last weekend on the design and we found the solution how to power a
motor just via using Permanent Magnets !

I will call this design from now on:


PM_Square  = (PM)^2

Permanent Magnet Powered Motor !
=         =      =       =


Well, here it is how it is working:


I will first describe a Linear Motor design and later post a few MPEG
movies of the enhanced rotor version experiments...

I will publish all my results and findings, so you are ready to duplicate
it yourself and prove me right or wrong. This way the basic design goes to
the Public Domain and can't be bought out or will be suppressed...
I just claim the inventor rights on the Angle Steel add-on design !

Please copy this file to all people, which care about environment
pollution and want to have a so called "free energy" machine.


For the full understanding of this PM_Square design you should have read
the TOMI description !

Here the PM_Square design goes:


The most important enhancements over the TOMI design are introduced via
2 angle steel plates at the endings on each track-magnet (in the TOMI
description called: Runner-magnet)
I will call these "Runner-Magnets" from now on Stator Track-magnets,
because they don't "run" , but are just the Stator-Magnets, which build
the track !

Okay, so how are these 2 Angle Steel plates fitted to the Track-Magnets ?

Here is a simple ASCII drawing:

This is the Top View of the Linear Motor design !
All magnets used are circular magnets. So the Roller Magnet can roll
through the track ! The number of stator track magnets can vary, but
should not be too many , cause it weakens the flux inside the track.
Go for around 7 to 10 magnets first. (7 are shown over here !)


By using Angle Steel plates of ST37 or ST100 (thickness of about 1 to 2.5
mm), one can force the magnetic flux at the endings of the permanent
magnet Stator Track to be going the right way!

In this case it prevents to pull the Roller Magnet back into the track,
when it leaves the track at the right side !
You can also try to use a "V"-shaped placement of the Stator Track magnets
(not putting them in parallel as shown, but at an opening angle of maybe 5
to 10 degrees), which I can't draw over here with this simple ASCII-"art"!

This enables the Roller magnet to get out of the Stator Track at the
ending even better and the killing force at the end of the track is far
more weaker !

One has to drop the Roller Permanent Magnet for the best performance
(acceleration) into the track at around 90 degrees (also 45 degrees would
still work!) at around 1/5 to 1/4 length of the track.
This way, the Roller Magnet is just pulled into the track and don't have
to go via the slight repulsion gate at the entrance of the track at the
very left side !

With using the steel plates fitted to the end of the track magnets you can
also try to push the Roller Magnet into the track at the left side, but it
will almost kill the received acceleration force from the previous track !
But with using the Angle Steel plates, this killing effect is much less,
than without using the Angle Steel plates...
So the secret to a Real Working Linear PM_Square motor are just these
Angle Steel Magnetic Flux guidance plates !

The best design to get the Roller going through an unlimited number of
Magnet Stator tracks would be the following design:

This Linear Motion Permanent Magnet Motor design should really work.
It uses the gravitational force to go downhill into the next magnetic
Stator Track.
In this Side View only the front Stator magnet is shown with the Angle
Steel at each end with the "wrong" angle drawn, due to the bad
perspectivic drawing view !(I am not able to draw it better with using
this ASCII- "art" ! Normally in the Side View the Angle Steel Plates would
point into direction of your face and not downwards ! But I have drawn it
downwards to make it clear, where the placement of the Angle Steel is
located !)

Have a look again above to the Top View and it will getting clear to you,
how the Angle Steel has to be placed !

In this enhanced Linear version you use only the "phase" inside the stator
track, that really accelerates the roller magnet. The fields at the beginning
and ending of the Stator magnet track are not used !
The roller magnet can thus come into and out of the accelerating Stator Track
without any killing force. The roller will just be accelerated each time
it goes into the next hill !

Okay, so far for now.

Please try to duplicate this Linear Motion design of PM_Square and let me
know, if it will work for you.

Theoretical explanation:
========================

I received this from an "anonymous" friend. Please read it and let me know
what you think about this theory for the explanation of the TOMI and
PM_Square effect !

I believe, that with using Permanent Magnets the Zero Point Energy can be
tapped ! (See Dr. Harraold Putthof's explanation of Zero Point Energy)

Irreversible Processes in Fields
================================

It is well known theory that the thermodynamic potentials go to
an extremum. This is regarded as equivalent to Planck's 2nd law
although the complete equivalence between both formulations of
the second law never have been proved generally, especially if we
apply the extremum principle of the thermodynamic potentials to
electromagnetic fields. In this article we investigate this
question.

I. Irreversible Processes in Vapour-Liquid Mixtures

We begin here with a well known and quite trivial example. We
regard two cylinder volumes connected by a tap in the middle.
Both the volumes can be set by moving a piston up and down into
or out of the volume.  With this experimental setup we proceed
the following isothermic irreversible cycle, comp fig.1a):We take a fluid
(for example water) being at the dew line of the
phase diagram. We expand both the pistons isothermically from
point 1 to point 2. So liquid condenses and is collected in the
lower cylinder. Now the tap is closed and both the volumes are
recompressed at equal pressures until the starting volume is
reached again. Now we regard the question whether Planck's law is
fulfilled. This question can be answered by writing the 2nd law
for free energy which states that the free energy F tends to be a
minimum. Therefore, if we leave the minimum in doing the cycle
          Fstart-Fend = - circle integral P dV > 0

must hold because the cycle is isothermal (dT=0)  with no matter
exchange (dn=0). The orientation of the integral shows that
Planck's second law holds, comp. fig.1b).

II. Irreversible Processes in Fields

a) General
According Landau and Lifshitz (1) the free energy of a system
including electric fields and linear dielectrics is defined by
     F'(V,T,D) = F(V,T) + 1/(8*Pi*eps) Int D^2 dV

The Legendre transform of this potential is

     F''(V,T,E) = F(V,T) - eps/(8*Pi) Int E^2 dV

Both these definitions are not useful for thermodynamics
because they are non-homologous functions regarding the molar
ratios. Therefore, the following definitions are used and
specified for constant dielectrics

f'(V,T,P) = f (V,T) + 1/(8*Pi) Int E dP = f + 1/(8*Pi*Xi) P^2
f''(V,T,E) = f(V,T) - 1/(8*Pi) Int P dE = f - Xi/(8*Pi) E^2
Regarding the 2nd derivative of the electric variable of both
these potentials we see that for a constant homogene dielectrics
f'(V,T,P) approaches a minimum and f''(V,T,E) approaches a
maximum in the equilibrium state, if Xi > 0. Similar
considerations hold for magnetic fields as well.
b) Mixing Processes
Now, similar like in section I, we investigate an isothermic and
isochoric cycle if an intense field is applied to a non ideal -
non linear binary dielectric liquid (2).
We start at the phase separation line at low field and apply a
stronger field. Then demixing of the solution occurs. We close
the tap and discharge the field. In the endpoint of the cycle at
lower field we reopen the tap and return to equilibrium. Because
we leave the equilibrium in performing the cycle the unequality

                df'' = - circle integral P dE < 0

holds according the last lines of section II a). Regarding the
orientation of this integral we realize that it is a negative
hysteresis relative to the usual ferroelectric hysteresis. Therefore, our
consideration predicts a violation of Planck's
second law  for electrically induced irreversibilities. The
irreversibility goes the other way round according to the Gibbs
formalism contrary to Planck's 2nd law.
c) Permanent Magnet Motors
In Landau/Lifshitz (1) there exists a proof which shows that if
we introduce a para- or ferromagnetic body into a fixed magnetic
field (j=constant) the following relation holds:

                    df' = - M dH

Because df' approaches a maximum we interprete this equation that
a self accelerating perpetual motion is possible in a magnetic
field as an irreversibility.

Therefore, in order to find an example we first rule out the conditions under
which a perpetuum mobile is impossible. This is always the case if the
magnetic field can be described as a potential field. According Jackson(3) a
magnetic field of a closed loop or the field of a hard permanent ferromagnet
can formally be decribed by a potential. This means that rot B vanishes. This
has as a consequence that a perpetuum mobile acceleration of a magnetic charge
is impossible.Therefore, the question arises whether there exists the
possibility to break this zero rot B - field.

The question can be answered positively.  Using by Mu metal shieldings a non
zero rot B field can be generated from a potential field by shielding off the
unwanted parts of the field . We illustrate this idea by the following axial
motor construction proposal which is derived by us from the linear Harris TMI
set up (4), comp. fig.3)+b), which works and which has been confirmed and
discussed by different persons(4,5). We do not claim that our proposal is a
perpetuum mobile.

We use a cylindrical tube of Mu metal as housing for the motor.  In the
housing tube we have a tube of lower diameter made from conducting material
having the same axis as the housing tube. A current flows in the inner tube
along the length equally distributed across the thicknell of the wall.The
common axis of both these cylinders consist of a wire carrying a current
flowing in the opposite direction relative to the current tube. If we look at
the configuration of the field we have a circular non vanishing rot B field in
one direction near the wall and a circular B field in the opposite direction
near the central wire.

Now we use the wire as an axis of a rotor which carries at least two
symmetrically balanced permanent magnets rods whose north poles point radially
and the south poles axially. The north poles are standing under the influence
of the B field near the wall, the south pole feels the opposite field near by
the wire. So a permanent torque is exerted on the rotor which begins to spin
around the central wire as the axis. We see that our motor works only with
permanent fields and needs no brushes.

Therefore, the question arises: Is it not possible to use permanent magnets +
Mu metal shields to replace the current wires by permanent magnets generating
circular non vanishing rot B fields of opposite orientation to get the rotor
spinning, comp.

fig.5a).  Similar constructions are already patented and can be found in the
literature (6), comp. fig. 5b).

Furthermore, we emphasize that until today there exist no generally accepted
magnetic force law between differential current loops. Only for closed current
loop the situation is clear, because all the different differential form
coincide in one. Different forms have been proposed by Biot Savart (7),
Ampere (7) (includes actio and reactio and conservation of angular momentum),
Whittaker (8) (includes only action=reaction), Aspden (7) (includes only
conservation of angular momentum) , and Marinov (9). Marinov claims that he
would have proved experimentally his form as the correct one. Therefore, there
seems to be an interesting field where important questions can be solved.

fig.4 magnetic motor with no brushes; top view
the magnet charges on the rotor are spinning around the axis wire
in the stationary double circular and opposite rot B fields of
the wire and the current tube.

fig.5a) our magnetic motor proposal using only permanent magnetsthe
central wire is replaced by an inner ring consisting of
permanent magnets and Mu metal shields generating an non
vanishing B-field; the current tube is replaced by an outer ring
of permanent magnets and Mu metal shields. the rotor is the same
as in fig. 4. The field configuration seen by the rotor is in
effect the same as in fig.4., only both the opposite non
vanishing rot B fields of the stator are generated by permanent
magnets. Unwanted parts of the field are shielded by Mu metal. It
is clear that the configuration can be multiplied to enforce the
power by taking more circles. Magnets similar as used by Johnson
are recommended for the stator fields, comp fig.5b). Using
electromagnets instead of permanent magnets would enhance power.

fig.5b) the Johnson motor, US Patent Nr. 4,151,431 permanent magnets as
stator, rotor with non vanishing rot B -field , see original patent disclaimer
