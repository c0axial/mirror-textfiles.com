                         Magnetic Resonance Amplifier
                           description of operation
                                by Joel McClain

The MRA is a series resonant LC circuit in which power gain is attainable as a
result of the increase in effective impedance under certain operating
conditions.  When the series impedance increases, primary current is reduced.
When the power available from the secondary coil either remains the same or
increases as the primary circuit impedance increases, a power gain occurs.

This is not possible with a series resonant circuit made of conventional
materials.  Even unity power transfer is considered to be unattainable as a
result of accumulated losses in the components, which are passive (reactive)
devices.  Materials and construction methods are chosen for these components
based upon the type of application and frequency to be applied, with the goal
of minimizing losses.

A typical capacitor with polyethylene dielectric has a dielectric constant of
2.3 times that of air.  Air has a constant of 1.0, and is the basis for
comparison.  Titanium dioxide, however, has a dielectric constant maximum of
170, and a corresponding power factor of only 0.0006, comparable with
polyethylene, so that the dissipation of primary current in the dielectric is
extremely low.  This is where the comparison ends, because the titanium
composite "capacitor" is also a piezoelectric device as well as an excellent
capacitor.

Heat adversely affects the power factor of most dielectric materials. Titanium
zirconate, however, contains polar molecules which rotate as thermal pressure
is applied.  This rotation increases the dielectric constant if the frequency
applied is equal to or lower than the resonant frequency of the dielectric.

At series resonance, the rotation of polar molecules contributes to heat; as
the dielectric constant increases, a corresponding release of free electrons
occurs, as a direct result of the piezoelectric properties of the device.

In application, the MRA is tuned at resonance for maximum power transfer, then
detuned slightly for maximum power gain.  This relates directly to the use of
thermal pressure at resonance, and the effect that this has on continued polar
rotation and the release of donor electrons.

The coil, or primary of the MRA is a magnetic core which, relative to the
fixed capacitance of the piezo, is a tuned permeability device.  This is often
used in RF devices to attain a stable resonant frequency.  Magnetic materials
are chosen based upon the operating characteristics of the intended
application to reduce eddy currents in the operating range.

In these applications, the resonant frequency of the magnet itself is avoided,
as this would "beat" with the oscillating current.  However, in the MRA, this
is the exact effect which we want.

The barium ferrite magnet resonates audibly at frequencies which are harmonics
of the series resonant frequency.  The effect of this in a typical audio
application is called harmonic distortion, and is not desirable, but once
again, in the MRA, this is what we want to occur.

There is energy in the harmonics, and this energy serves to both counter eddy
losses as well as to oppose primary current flow, while contributing to
circulating current within the resonant circuit.

The net effect of this, is that when the MRA is detuned, harmonics of the
audible frequency "beat" with primary current, opposing its flow, while the
increase in circulating current couples more power to the secondary, and
therefore to the load.  This is how the power gain is attained, basically by
considering the naturally occuring harmonics as beneficial instead of as
undesirable effects to be filtered out.

When the MRA is detuned, the effective impedance increases as seen by the
source, while the power available to the load decreases in less proportion.
This is measurable by using resistive equivalent circuit testing.  However,
the detuning is load dependent, and slight adjustments are required if the
load requirement is greater than the power band of a harmonic interaction.

After retuning, the power to the load will increase in quantum intervals as
the circulating current is reinforced by the reaction of the permeable magnet
core.  This will be seen as slight incremental voltage increases across the
load device.

Once the magnet is "ringing", it's frequency and therefore harmonics remain
stable, as long as the series resonant range is not exceeded.  Therefore, the
detuning affects the piezo only, and the circulating current increase is a
result of the phase relationship between the harmonic and the source.

Voltage amplification is seen across the primary, measurably higher than the
source voltage, and this is "seen" by the secondary.  This is not the same
thing as a power gain, because the power gain is a direct result of effective
impedance.

It should also be noted that the term "virtual rotation" has been applied in
describing the operation of the MRA.  The comparison is made with a generator,
in which relative motion occurs between a coil and magnet.  Rather than use
physical energy to rotate a mass, the MRA uses resonance to rotate the energy.

This is seen in the polar rotation of the piezo dielectric as well as in the
molecular energy occuring in the reactive component of the magnet, ie, the
ringing.  The lattice structures of the piezo and magnet are compatible for
virtual rotation, and the materials complement each other electrically.

In the past, researchers have noted many effects which occur at aggregate
resonance, which typically includes a range of three octaves.  Anomalous
energy gains were referred to as "aetheric".  The aether was believed to exist
outside of the three physical dimensions, and could be "tapped" for free
energy at resonance.

Aetheric energy is said to be limitless, but to vary locally with increases in
earth magnetic fields at sunset and sunrise, like the tides of an infinite
ocean.  This effect is not thoroughly understood, but has been observed in the
MRA, as increases in output in the early morning, and decreases in the early
evening. This is still being studied.

Experimentation will determine the optimum MRA design for a specific range of
applications.

Vanguard Note

  The use of Lenz Law (back EMF) is legend in free energy circuits.  When the
  back EMF is reversed and phase matched to the forward EMF, you have an
  increase in efficiency because of the reduction of eddy current heating
  through the addition of the previously wasted power.

  This is generally understood to apply primarily to magnetic flux, yet
  because frequency is involved, phase conjugate principles play a major part.
  Phase conjugation applies to all frequencies regardless of the type of
  energy being used.  Harmony (constructive interference) and dissonance
  (destructive interference) are controlled using phasing and frequency
  relationships.

  If the rhythmic energy flowing through the mass is made resonant to the mass
  aggregate resonance, you further reduce the resistance and impedance,
  thereby achieving unity and in some cases overunity.

  Most people want clean and simple circuits.  These would not entail physical
  motion or large inductive masses as are encountered in orthodox generators.
  The MRA circuit fits this approach very nicely because it does not involve
  moving mass, but rather moving energy harmoniously to produce energy.

  Further information on the MRA, its operational characteristics,
  correlations and updates will be provided as they are documented.
