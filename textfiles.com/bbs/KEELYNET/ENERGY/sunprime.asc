                             A Solar Energy Primer

       Solar Energy can be converted for use on earth in several ways.  The
       Sun is of  course  our closest star, upon which we are dependent for
       life.  The sun is estimated to be at least 4.5 billion years old and
       it has an average distance from earth of about 92,000,000 miles.

       Its core temperature is 15,000,000 degrees centigrade.  Its total
       energy output is 3.83 x 10^23 KW.  It is the source of energy for
       oil, natural gas, coal, hydro, wind and an argument could be made
       that even nuclear fission owes its existence to the sun.

       Sunlight is a form of Radiant Energy  that  is  manifests as heat in
       any object that  is  exposed to it.  Heat is the result  of  excited
       molecules in the object, not the sunlight itself.  This is analogous
       to when you get sunburned on a relatively cool day and don't realize
       it, which is a result of too many ultraviolet rays.

       The technology involved in capturing this solar energy for man's use
       goes back thousands   of   years.   There  are  several  methods  of
       utilizing Solar Energy.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       PASSIVE SOLAR is the design of structures  to  efficiently use solar
       energy without mechanical devices.  A building can be so designed as
       to become a  solar collector.  This is done by having  large  window
       areas placed on  the  south  side  of  the  home which capture solar
       energy in tile floors that absorb,  store  and  re-radiate the heat.
       Overhangs can also  be provided in the design to block  the  sun  in
       summer months.

                                      Page 1





       Passive Solar Design   usually  requires  that  these  concepts  are
       incorporated into the structure when it is built since a retrofit is
       difficult, but not impossible.

       Obviously a design that is appropriate  in  Montana is inappropriate
       in Mississippi, where  for  a good portion of the year,  solar  heat
       gain is not advantageous.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       ACTIVE SOLAR is  the  process of using mechanical devices to capture
       and store solar energy.  Most people  are  familiar  with  the  flat
       plate solar collector, they were becoming popular  during  the  late
       1970's and early 1980's.

       The flat plate  collector  consists of a box typically 8" high by 5'
       wide by 10' long that had a copper  absorber  plate  and  tubing.  A
       glass cover is placed over the box and the greenhouse effect creates
       temperatures up to 200 degrees F inside the collector.

       A pump circulates a heat transfer fluid through the  collector, then
       through a heat  exchanger.   A separate pump circulates water from a
       hot water tank through the heat exchanger transferring heat from the
       collector to the storage tank.

       A properly designed solar thermal system provides 70% or better of a
       family's hot water in a climate like Mississippi.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       A variation of  the  flat  plate system  that  is  very  popular  in
       Australia and Israel is the thermosyphon system that  does  not  use
       pumps or controls.

       The storage tank  is  placed above the collector and as the water is
       heated in the collector, it rises  to  the  storage  tank and cooler
       water enters the  collector.   Thermosyphon  systems  are  extremely
       efficient for domestic   hot  water  uses  and  have  been  used  in
       Australia for 40 years.

       The design life of a properly designed  active  solar thermal system
       is at least  20 years.  Thermal systems can also  be  used  to  heat
       homes using heat  exchangers  such  as  baseboard  heaters.  Usually
       there is a backup source such as  gas  or  electric  to  provide for
       extensive over-cast periods.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Solar air collectors do not use water but rather  air  as  the  heat
       transfer medium.  This  system uses blowers to circulate air through
       the collectors and directly heat a home.  Heat can be stored in rock
       bins or transferred using water as the heat carrier medium.

       One of the interesting uses for solar  air  systems is drying grains
       such as wheat, rice etc.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       FOCUSING CONCENTRATOR COLLECTORS  are  very  high  temperature   and
       pressure systems that  are  applicable to industrial and large scale
       power generation.  They work in a  similar  fashion  to a magnifying
       glass in the sunlight.  Solar Energy is concentrated using lenses or
       mirrors onto a central "receiver".

       Fluid is circulated through the receiver where temperatures of 7,000
       degrees have been generated.  The heat converts water to steam which
       then drives a steam turbine.  The largest system currently on line

                                      Page 2





       is in the   Mohave   Desert   of   California,   and  is  generating
       approximately 300 megawatts of electricity.

       The largest single unit is SEGS 8,  rated at 13.8 KV 5000 Amps or 80
       Megawatts.  Each system  is  (1)  Square  Mile in Area  with  linear
       "trough" collectors that  track  the  sun.  Currently there are four
       additional units under construction rated at 80 Megawatts each.

       Concentrating collectors operate   more   efficiently  in  a  desert
       environment, as intermittent  cloud  cover  can produce  temperature
       differentials in the  array.   This in turn produces physical stress
       from expansion and contraction of the material.  Concentrators
       are not efficient at converting diffuse  solar  energy, an advantage
       that flat plate collectors have over the concentrating.

       In other words  on  a  partly cloudy day the concentrator  would  be
       practically useless, where  a  flat plate system generates heat even
       on overcast days due to the greater surface area.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       PHOTOVOLTAICS is the direct conversion  of  sunlight to electricity.
       This is achieved  by  layering  a  semiconducting material,  usually
       silicon, into at  least  two  layers  consisting  of a P and N layer
       separated by a Boron barrier layer.

       To make a  very  long  story  extremely   short,  sunlight  "knocks"
       electrons from the  silicon  that  then follows the  path  of  least
       resistance onto "grids"  that have been mounted onto the surface and
       back of the solar cell.

       These "cells" are then connected in  a  manner similar to flashlight
       batteries, that is,  positive  to  negative, and are  configured  to
       provide the appropriate  power desired.  The cells are mounted in an
       aluminum frame with a glass cover.

       The first use  of  solar  cells for  power,  was  space  satellites.
       Another common use  is  for  "solar" calculators which  have  become
       popular during the  last  few  years.  There are larger applications
       for "terrestrial" use that are coming into use.

       It is already economically competitive to use PV (Photovoltaic) if a
       home is to be powered at a distance  of  1/2  mile  from the closest
       utility service.

       The choice becomes one of paying a utility company  to  construct  a
       line to the home and then paying a monthly bill or constructing a PV
       System and being self sufficient.

       Other practical applications  include  small  panels for keeping the
       batteries charged on tractors, bull  dozers,  etc.  that spend hours
       outside and are used intermittently.  Recreational  Vehicles  are an
       additional use that  is  becoming  increasingly  popular.  The PV RV
       works very well due to the 12 Volt System for which the RV is wired.

       The Photovoltaics can provide a means  of  reducing  the  use of the
       Generator, extending its life and reducing the associated noise.

       PV's have also  become  practical  for  pumping  water   in   remote
       locations using submersible  pumps.   Also PV powered pump jacks are
       available that can pump up to 5000  gallons a day with out using gas
       or utility connections.
                                      Page 3





       Telecommunications is also  a  practical application of PV and there
       are many Microwave repeaters powered  by sunlight.  In fact wherever
       a remote location needs electricity, PV is the hands down winner for
       providing it.

       A diesel or  gas generator needs constant fuel and attention,  where
       PVs operate without  fuel  and  the  only  maintenance is occasional
       checking of batteries.

       Photovoltaics for residential use  can  be  achieved  in  two  ways.
       First is the utility inter-tie in which excess electricity is sold
       to the utility.   The  homeowner  pays  the difference  in  what  is
       consumed and produced.

       The utility however  is only obligated to pay the "avoided" cost for
       the electricity which is usually considered  to be about 60 cents on
       the dollar on what the utility charges.

       Other drawbacks are  that  when  the  utility goes offline,  the  PV
       system must also go offline to prevent shock to line workers. The
       utility inter-tie would not require battery storage however, which
       is a significant cost of PV Systems.

       The second type  of  system  could  be  considered  a  Solar Powered
       Uninterruptable Power Supply for the  home.  A battery bank provides
       power for the home which is charged by PV when solar  is  available,
       when solar is  not  available  the  batteries  are  charged  by  the
       utility.  This system  offers several  advantages  including  backup
       power for utility loss and substantial savings on electrical bills.

       Should these savings   be  reinvested  into  the  system,   eventual
       disconnect from the   utility  would  be  possible.    As  utilities
       increase rates, the  construction   of   these   systems   will   be
       inevitable.  An additional benefit to the United States would be the
       decentralization of the electrical supply.

       Currently a concerted terrorist attack could bring  down  the entire
       electrical network, with  the  attack  of  a  relatively  few  power
       transformers and transmission lines.   PV  would  be  a  way  of not
       having all of our eggs in one basket.

       Vangard note....

            An average modern home uses up to 10,000 Watts  of  power while
            an apartment  will  use  up  to  about  8,000.  Of course, this
            varies depending on the size  of the dwelling, whether or not a
            climate controlled  system  is  used  to  maintain   a   stable
            temperature and how many appliances are used.

                                      Page 4





            Many people  are  not  aware  that  most  modern  equipment  is
            partially ON all the time.   The  practice  of  designing  this
            feature into  modern equipment began because  older  Television
            sets required a warmup time before the picture would come on.

            When the   newer   circuitry   was  first  introduced,  it  was
            advertised as "instant-on" to lure the buyer into selecting the
            new models since they would not  have to wait until the picture
            tube heated up.

            A modern  dwelling therefore usually has at least  one  TV,  at
            least one  VCR,  one  or  more  refrigerators  and  a  host  of
            electronic appliances which require  some form of idling power.
            So it is very easy to total up the watts necessary.

            Inductive devices are not generally on all the  time,  but they
            are the  ones  which use the greatest amount of energy, usually
            because they drive heavy loads,  such  as  refrigeration units,
            air conditioners,  washer/dryers,  generally   speaking,   most
            motors.

            An interesting  observation  in  relation to the so-called free
            energy devices is that they will  ONLY  power RESISTIVE devices
            and NOT INDUCTIVE devices.  One of the reasons  cited  for this
            is that  the  free  energy  usually  depends on a tuned circuit
            which can be considerably loaded by any inductive components.

            It would make an interesting  study to see just how much energy
            was used  when  all the devices which use this  idling  current
            were PHYSICALLY  DISCONNECTED  from the power lines when not in
            actual use.  We would probably  be  amazed  as to how our power
            bill would  diminish  were  we  to  implement   such  a  simple
            procedure.

            We have a friend who suggested making giant versions of thermo-
            electric converters  using  P/N  junctions.   He  says he and a
            group of  friends made one of  these  giant  thermocouples  and
            planted it   in  the  ground  where  it  would   experience   a
            temperature differential  between  the  coolness  of  the earth
            (averaging about 68 degrees  at  6  feet year round) to that of
            the above ground air.

            Of course, there are also multiple thermodynamic  systems which
            use very  sensitive  refrigerants  to successively tap into any
            heat/cool temperature differential.

            It would be nice to have some  bucks to investigate the various
            methods and  make  a kit which anyone could build  and  use  to
            furnish power for their home or transport.
