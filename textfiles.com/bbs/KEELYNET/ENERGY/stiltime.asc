This file raises some interesting questions about our perception of 'reality'.

Well science has done it to reality again!  Damn math and Algebra goble-de-
goop.

For a moment take a step back and stop trying to think of things in three
dimensional Cartiesian Geometry, good you're probably all there already.

Now I've got a hot little thought going on about the true speed of light, the
expansion of the universe, time travel, blackhole radiation and the
proportionality of probability on reality.

Yes! it actually changes as the universe expands (yet the probabilities stay
constant, they simply grow in magnitude). So does anyone want to hear a hot
thought on why light breaks into matter and anti-matter (regardless of all
previous ideas, Hey I'm not trying to educate anyone or anything, I'm just
issuing some food for thought!)

Check this out..... The universe is expanding in a cone thats widening at an
exponential rate. So if the X+Y axis were quantity of Space (Y) and Time(X)
the increments of those axis would increase at an exponential rate.  2, 4, 16,
blah blah blah.......and then the line of S= 1 / (X^2 / C^2)^.5  is a straight
upward slope.

In normal increments it looks like a "Gabriels Horn." Now if you take the
curved line and plot a triangle between point normal (P)

    space         |                      |     this is how the drawing came
                  |                     |      across as in ASCII characters
 Original drawing |                    /
                  | ________  /
                  |_____________P_
                                    time
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    space         |               |            this version might be closer
                  |               |            to the curve the author speaks
 Altered drawing  |             /              of
                  | ________  /
                  |_____________P_
                                  time

You get voila! the quantity of REALITY, Ok this sounds crazy but just let
it sink in...now take the difference in the plottings and you get an ever
increasingly large probability triangle (above the reality triangle) that
is the proportionality of reality to probability.

This comes into play with time travel and plotting the probability of a
paradox by knowing the probability of alternate outcomes. (Based on the
probability of regressing on certain event horizons.) Well blah blah blah If
you want a better more descriptive diagram you'll have to give me your address
so I can send some real graphs and not this ascii crap.

On to black hole radiation. Lets say you plot the expansion of the universe
along a time & space graph (space representing the manifold three dimensions
as one quantity) now presume that the resulting curve (use the above formula)
is the progression of a light beam which is the very farthest from the center
of the universe. (Because along Space and time travels light, needing both to
exist.

Time causes light to appear curved, space telling light how to curve) [and of
course light being egotistical and obnoxiouse ever since Einstein gave it it's
heyday] Light disregards both of their effects on itself.

So light travels along any proportionally curved path inside that original
"maximum" curve of the graph. (I won't go into it here but it also seems to
suggest by plotting a few handy differentials that light farthest from the
center of the universe should travel faster than all other light.)

Now say light hits a little spot where there is no space but there is time.
Basically a trough where it cannot travel at the speed of light. It must
destroy itself to create space (matter & anti matter) to travel that space.

You may ask "but how can there be no space" Simple it is a point where there
is no matter, and all energy fields are balanced out perfectly, in fact there
would be neither matter nor field lines in that area.

By the sake of other fields they are not canceled out, but driven away to form
a perfect void of space. An area of this space would be quite difficult to
detect.

Say you hold a RADAR gun and aim it a a 5 mile strech of "no space" behind
which there is a star. Your gun would say (when directed to determine the
distance between you and the object the gun is pointed at) that there is
no distance.

In fact you would be dead, You shouldn't stand so close to stars. Now I have
no postulate on what happens to light where there is no time. I can only think
that for that pocket light is allowed to not curve.  Wacky huh.  Well these
happen to be just Ideas, but they have unique possibilities.  Hope you
respond.

Cure.

P.S. If you also noticed that some of the implications of the above formula
are that eventually time will come to a stand still while space procreates at
an infinite rate don't worry. The process will go back in on itself. So
basically the universe has never changed. Simply the quantity of time has
shifted in favor or space.

P.P.S. Don't rag the spelling errors, OK?
