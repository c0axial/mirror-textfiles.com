                           A Radical New Thermal Engine

       A Swedish scientist  has  revived  a  centuries-old controversy with
       contentions that he  has discovered  the  theoretical  basis  for  a
       perpetual-motion machine.

       Most foreign scientists  dismiss  the  notion of such  a  device  as
       contravening fundamental laws  of  thermodynamics,  but  the Swedish
       claim has created  much  excitement   among  scientific  circles  in
       Stockholm.

       The man making  the  claim  is  Professor Baltzar  von  Platen,  77,
       regarded in Sweden  as  the  inventor of the modern refrigerator and
       the first person to produce synthetic diamonds.

       His theories involve the production  of  energy  through  a  complex
       process involving air, ammonia, and salt in an apparatus rotating at
       very high speed,  but  scientific  sources  said   the   system  was
       difficult to explain in layman's language.

       Professor von Platen  has  said  in newspaper interviews that unless
       his ideas are invalidated by some  natural  law, the energy could be
       harnessed to run cars, warm houses, or power aircraft.

       He is expected to file a patent application soon and  the  secretary
       of the Royal  Academy of Science, Professor Sam Nilsson, said he had
       gone through the 50-page documents and could find no basic flaw.

       He said the theory put Professor von  Platen  in a class with Thomas
       Edison, who perfected  the  electric  light bulb, and  Marconi,  who
       developed the modern radio.

       But other scientists  were  more  skeptical.  One physicist said the
       theory ran counter to all known laws.

       "There is only a limited amount of  energy around, if you use energy
       up and don't replace it, you run out", he said.

       The physicist was asked if it was possible that Professor von Platen
       had hit upon  an  entirely  new  law  of thermodynamics  that  could
       explain his ideas.

       "Every day there  are  millions  of  processes going on and they all
       obey the laws as we know them", he said.

       At the heart of Professor von Platen's idea is a spontaneous heating
       process which is continuous.

       It begins with the air-water-ammonia  process in the centrifuge.  As
       it spins faster   and  faster,  the  pressure  at  the   extremities
       increases up to  1,000  times  that of the atmosphere (14.7 x 1000 =
       14,700 PSI), generating heat which could be used to drive a turbine.

       Professor Sven Brohult,  director   of   the   National  Academy  of
       Engineering Sciences, said that even if the theory  was  only partly
       correct, the practical applications could be enormous.

       Vangard Note

           We understand  that  heat  pumps  are  routinely claimed to have
           excess energy outputs in the range of 2 to 5 times what it takes
           to operate the heat pump.  An  engineer  we  met  here in Dallas
           named Mike Eskely also claimed to have a turbine which generated
           overunity by high velocity rotation of gases.  Although we never
           saw a  working model, he is convinced he is onto  something  and
           has over 50 patents to his name.

           Mr. Eskely told us that in Texas, there were laws that protected
           the power  companies from having to purchase energy that was not
           produced using "acceptable" co-generation sources.

           One of the methods that is forbidden  is HEAT PUMPS.  If you try
           to sell your excess power (generated through  a  Heat  Pump  co-
           generator) back  to  the power company, they are NOT REQUIRED to
           buy it.  As we understand it,  they  ARE  REQUIRED  to  purchase
           excess power generated from Solar, Wind, Fossil Fuel, Geothermal
           or Hydro co-generated systems.

           We would greatly appreciate further information relating to this
           subject, especially details of Professor von Platen's work.
