       Vangard Note..

          This file  brought  up  a  curious  comment  regarding a possible
          correlation between stock market  fluctuations  and  some kind of
          planetary correspondence  that  could  be  detected  by  Townsend
          Browns' Electrometer,   an   electrostatically  energized  device
          suspended in oil.

          Further information regarding  this  effect  is taken from File :
          24-185, Subject  :  Special  Inquiry  into  "The  Townsend  Brown
          Electro-Gravity Device", a Comprehensive Evaluation by the Office
          of Naval   Research,   with   accompanying  documents,  dated  15
          September 1952.

            from the Los Angeles Times - Tuesday Morning, April 8, 1952

                       Flying Saucers 'Explained' by Men of
                           New Research University Here

       Two metal-plexiglass disks suspended  from  a  central  pylon  swung
       through slow circles in a darkened room yesterday as spokesmen for a
       new university sought  to  convince  newsmen  they have  solved  the
       flying saucer mystery.

       "We have hesitated  to  divulge  our  findings,"  said  Mason  Rose,
       president of the University for Social  Research, "because they read
       too much like science fiction..."

       Substance of the  alleged  discovery, credited to Inventor  Townsend
       Brown,  is that saucers operate in a field of "electro-gravity" that
       "acts like a wave with the negative pole at the top and the positive
       pole at the bottom."
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                               Travel Like Surfboard

       "The saucer travels  like  a surfboard on the incline of a wave that
       is kept continually  moving  by the  saucer's  electro-gravitational
       generator," explained Bradford Shank, third spokesman  for the group
       claiming knowledge "almost too sensational, too spectacular."

       All three men   are   convinced   that   flying  saucers  are  real,
       "controlled by an intelligence rather than a pilot" and capable of

                                      Page 1





       speeds up to that of light - 186,000 miles a second.

       Their research is  new and novel, they insist, and "it is distinctly
       improbable it has   been  duplicated   anywhere   in   the   world."
       Experiments coupling electricity and gravitation that  apparently go
       even beyond Einstein's unified field theory.

       Asked about official  government  study of their findings, Rose said
       details had been given to "some Navy  admirals" but as yet there was
       no censorship.  He talked guardedly about military "interest" in the
       work but declined to mention specific agencies.

       He spoke too  about  the early trials and tribulations  of  Marconi,
       Edison and the  Wright  brothers.   The  three men said space travel
       will be possible within 10 years.

       At one point Shank was asked if he had a degree.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                              "Superior Intelligence"

       "No," he acknowledged, "I'm free of  those encumbrances.  That's why
       I find it  so  easy  to  talk in these new terms."  To  all  deadend
       questions there was  the  answer, "A superior intelligence thousands
       of years ahead of ours would have many answers we don't know about."

       For more than four years Brown has  been  attempting  to predict the
       ups and downs  of  the  stock  market with electronic  apparatus  he
       installed in the  basement  of  a building on S. Spring Street.  His
       equipment, he said, registers small variations in sidereal or cosmic
       rays which bombard the earth from outer space.

       These rays, in  some  yet  unexplained   manner,  are  suspected  of
       influencing human psychology.  Brown declined to say  how  his stock
       market "barometer" has worked.

       Confidential Security Information

                An Investigation relative to Thomas Townsend Brown
                               by Willoughby M. Cady
                        Office of Naval Research, Pasadena

                  (a possible clue as to the construction of his
                    electrogravitic detector mechanism follows)

       2.4  There has  been  briefly  inspected  a third electrical device,
       purporting to be  a  communication   equipment  operating  on  waves
       related to the   electrogravitic  effect.   It  appears   that   the
       transmitter is simply  a  relaxation oscillator consisting of a high
       tension DC power supply, a high (value)  resistor,  and  a condensor
       which periodically discharges through a short gap.

       The receiver, shown in Figure 2, consists of two Pyranol  capacitors
       0-5mf, two titanium oxide capacitors 500mmf, a Brush recorder, and a
       bypass capacitor 0.1mf  to  prevent  the  recorder from oscillating.
       Two terminals in  the  circuit  are   charged  as  indicated  before
       reception and left floating during reception.

                                      Page 2





       The bridge of four capacitors is housed in a cabinet, indicated by a
       dashed line, which  forms  an  obviously  imperfect  shield  against
       electromagnetic radiation, when the  transmitter  is  operated in an
       adjoining room, the Brush recorder jumps with each spark.  Mr. Brown
       states that the  effect  is  present,  but  reduced,   if  the  25KV
       potentials are not applied.

       If the Pyranols are short circuited and removed, the effect is still
       reported present.  No   attempt   has   been   made   at   conscious
       electromagnetic shieldings of   either   the   transmitter   or  the
       receiver.  In the writer's opinion the response may be the result of
       a chance rectifying contact.

       The relation between  the  communication device and  the  mechanical
       effects which form  the topic of this report (levitation) appears so
       remote that no further mention will be made of the former.

       The Brown Electrometer

       5.0  In a small thermostated room  in  the  second  basement  of the
       Banks-Huntley Building, (address censored), Los Angeles,  there is a
       continuing experiment which   shows   an   extension  of  the  basic
       phenomenon.  This apparatus is the Brown Electrometer.

       This device is  housed in an oil-filled  tank  of  half-inch  steel,
       perhaps two feet in diameter and a foot deep, with a half-inch steel
       cover.  In the  tank  there is suspended a horizontal  disc  12"  in
       diameter and one inch thick, made of six segments of pine wood

                                      Page 3





       alternating with six  of  marble  around an 8" hub of Bakelite.  The
       sections are separated by 1 X 2 X 1/16 inch copper strips.

       Alternate strips are grounded to a central metal stem supporting the
       disc which is attached to a music-wire suspension 0.018" in diameter
       and 6-3/8" long; the remaining copper  strips  connect  to a central
       iron tit at the center of the hub, which dips into a cup of mercury.

       The disc is surrounded by a grounded metal shield which  is attached
       to the tank  and  which  stands at a clearance of 1/2 inch above and
       below the disc and 1-1/2 inch radially;  this  shield  is  centrally
       perforated at the top and bottom for the suspension and the tit.

       A sequencing device in a cabinet below the tank causes  a  half-wave
       smoothed DC power  supply  to  impress  upon the mercury cup a well-
       regulated negative potential  of   11.1KV  resulting  in  a  leakage
       current of 0.45ma.   The  sequencer  leaves the voltage  on  for  30
       seconds, causing the disc to rotate several degrees.

       After 30 seconds,  a  short  spark  is  made  to  jump  from a point
       projecting about 9 inches horizontally  in  air from the stem of the
       disc, and perforates  a  rice-paper  strip wound  on  a  drum  which
       rotates once each  day.  The voltage is then turned off and the disc
       returns to its relaxed position,  which  is  recorded  by a separate
       spark.  The cycle  repeats  every  three  minutes.    The  apparatus
       appears to be well engineered and extremely reliable.

       5.1  Mr. Brown   has  given  attention  for  several  years  to  the
       variations in the deflections of  this  electrometer.   On the spark
       record the rest  position is 50 units and the deflected  reading  is
       about 80.  Until  about  a  year and a half ago (written in 1952, so
       estimated mid 1950),  the  deflected  position  was  about  20,  but
       suffered a gradual change to its present value at that time.

       Aside from reversal  of sign, the deflection undergoes  fluctuations
       whose character is  less dramatic but still large, e.g. 10-50%.  The
       cause of these fluctuations has been  sought by Mr. Brown by seeking
       for correlations between  them and various outside influences,  such
       as magnetic storms,  temperature,  pressure,  the  time of the year,
       civil time, lunar time, siderial time, and the Dow-Jones average.

       Only the last five correlations are  claimed.   Tabulated  data  are
       available only for the year 1937.  Hourly recordings  throughout the
       year are tabulated, for both civil and lunar time.

       The writer has seen no convincing evidence that the stock market and
       the automatic record  are  correlated, although it is claimed that a
       chi-square analysis has been performed, with POSITIVE RESULTS.

       (the tables are intentionally not  included  in this file since they
       simply furnish data, if you wish a copy of the tables  as taken from
       the document, drop us a line here at KeelyNet)

       5.3  By the  foregoing  sketchy  analysis of the data from the Brown
       Electrometer, the following conclusions are implied:

           a)  Through the weeks and months the data drift significantly;
           b)  There is NO evidence of a solar diurnal period synchronizing
               with the sun, as claimed by Brown.

                                      Page 4





           c)  There is NO evidence of a lunar diurnal period synchronizing
               with the  moon,  as  claimed by Brown.  On the contrary, the
               data appear most emphatically to deny such a period.

       5.4  Two related experiments have  been described by Mr. Brown which
       throw light on the reason for the deflections if not  on  the reason
       for their fluctuations.

       5.4.1  In one,  the sector disc was held stationary while a grounded
       metal disc was suspended over it  in  the  oil,  by a torsion fibre.
       When the sector disc was charged a motion of the  adjacent  oil  was
       noted by Mr.  Brown.   The  suspended disc deflected, but not when a
       glass plate was interposed between the sector disc and the suspended
       disc.

       5.4.2  The other related experiment concerns an oil-immersed annulus
       described by Mr. Brown as 2 feet in  diameter  and six inches thick,
       made of LEAD OXIDE (PbO) and paraffin in eight segments separated by
       eight copper strips alternately charged positive and negative.

       By means of  a  probe  the potential distribution  on  the  PbO  and
       parrafin surfaces was  explored  and  it  was noted that whereas the
       gradient was uniform across the edges of the lead oxide sectors, the
       gradient on the parrafin was steepest near the negative electrodes.

       This observation means that the steepest  gradients  ARE  ALL IN THE
       SAME DIRECTION, e.g.  CLOCKWISE.   It  was  also   noted   that  the
       application of high  voltage to the electrodes of this disc caused a
       lively motion of the oil.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       8.4  (see paragraph 5)  The disc of  the Brown Electrometer shown in
       Figure 5, develops a torque in response to an applied  voltage.  The
       field in the  oil  is strongest in the regions A. B. C. D. where the
       oil is in contact with the electrodes  separating the pine sectors P
       from the marble sectors M.

       Positive ions formed at the electrodes as in a corona discharge will
       produce positive space  charges at the regions A. & D. while regions
       B. & C. will have negative space  charges.   In  the  oil these will
       cause effects analogous to the electric wind in air.

       If the fields A. B. C. D. are equally strong the ion  densities will
       be such as  to  give  no net torque to the disc.  We will assume, on
       the other hand,  that the surface  of  the  pine  sectors  allows  a
       leakage current; this will have the effect of reducing  the field in
       the regions A.  &  B. and will leave the regions C. & D. dominant in
       the production of force.

       The positive ions at D. will TEND TO ROTATE the disc CLOCKWISE while
       the negatives will tend to rotate  it counterclockwise.  Since their
       mobilities differ there  will be a net torque in one  or  the  other
       direction, as observed.

       If the chemistry  of  the oil or the insulating sectors changes with
       the surface conductivity of the marble could become larger than that
       of the pine, causing a reversal of  the  torque.  Aside from surface
       conductivity, other attributes may distinguish the  marble  from the
       pine.  For example, a net torque might be caused by the influence of
       different dielectric constants  from  the  field distribution, or if
       alternate sectors all project slightly beyond the electrodes.

       A net torque  may  result  from or  be  influenced  by  the  surface
       conductivity of the pine and marble.  If one is more conductive than
       the other, the  field  pattern  will  be  made  unsymmetrical   (see
       paragraph 5.4.2 above) and the torque will be altered.

       It is possible  that the slow fluctuations in the Brown Electrometer
       are caused by changes in the surfaces.   The faster fluctuations may
       be caused by particles suspended in oil, which may  temporarily rest
       at such points as A. or B., changing the corona there temporarily.

       8.5  The experiment  reported  in  paragraph  5.4.1,  would  seem to
       corroborate the idea that a swirling  of the oil is essential to the
       operation of the  electrometer.   This idea is in  accord  with  the
       electric wind theory, whether or not the discussion in paragraph 8.4
       is valid in detail.

       8.6  It is  claimed  that  the  deflections of the electrometer show
       certain periodicities.  If these  are  real  they show inadequacy of
       the electric wind  hypothesis.   Their reality is  assessed  in  the
       crude and preliminary   analysis  contained  in  paragraph  5.2  and
       summarized in paragraph 5.3.

       There is no manifest solar diurnal  period  and  no  manifest  lunar
       diurnal period.  No  test has been applied for the claimed  siderial
       diurnal period or  for  the  correlation with the value of financial
       securities.

       Neither has it been possible to determine  whether  the slow changes
       in deflection are  repeated  annually as claimed; however  the  fact
       that the deflections  once  annually  permanently reversed direction
       would seem to discourage this claim.

       This reversal is attributable to changed surface conductivity of the
       sectors of the disc.  It is concluded that the short study

       (paragraph 5) of  the  readings  of  the Brown Electrometer does not
       weaken the hypothesis  that  all   the  (censored:  probably  reads,
       "phenomena reported by Mr. Brown") are the result of electric wind.

       Vangard Note

          We had  a call from a Mr. Paul Stowe relating  the  use  of  lead
          oxide by  Brown  in  the  construction  of his "gravitator".  Mr.
          Stowe thinks a layered version  of  this lead oxide might be used
          to construct a "collector" as postulated by Bearden  in his paper
          "The Final  Secret  to  Free  Energy"  and  listed on KeelyNet as
          FREENRG3.ZIP.

          The following refers to the thrust  developed  in  one experiment
          but the interesting point is the description of  the construction
          of the condenser dielectric.

       "The condenser dielectric  was  either  homogenous or laminated.  In
       one laminated version, 10,000 sheets  of  0.001  inch lead foil were
       separated by an  equal  number  of  3  X 3" sheets  of  0.0008  inch
       cellulose acetate in   a   formica   box   (sounds  like  an  orgone
       accumulator to me),  to  make  10,000   condensers   in   a   series
       arrangement weighing 10kg."

       "The acceleration exhibited by this device when suitably  mounted is
       claimed to have  been  2.5cm per sec^ (where the symbol ^ = squared)
       when the electrodes were charged, evidencing a force of 25,000 dynes
       or about 25gm; the homogeneous type  is  stated by Mr. Brown to have
       had comparable thrust.   The force was usually TOWARD  the  positive
       electrode, although in  some  units it was toward the negative; this
       effect was attributed to a "polarization"."

       "The force is stated to have been STRONGER at some time than others,
       correlating with the  position  of  the  sun  and  moon.   Data  are
       displayed which relate to the angular speed of a pivoted gravitator,
       and which show half a dozen large fluctuations in  a  day;  some  of
       these can perhaps  be  construed as being dips simultaneous with the
       rise or setting of the sun or moon."
