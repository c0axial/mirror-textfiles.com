       This file is   in   response   to   the   message  concerning  vapor
       carburetors. During the late 70's  I  was  involved  with a group in
       Southern California called "The Carburetor Union".   The union was a
       loose knit group of engineers and tinkers.  The purpose of the group
       was to investigate  and  promote high mileage fuel systems for cars.
       The group met once a month at Mile  Square  Park  in Fountain Valley
       California. Small groups  within  the  union  typically   met  every
       Saturday.

       The fuel systems  that  were  developed  and  shown  at the meetings
       ranged from somewhat usable to outright  dangerous.  Several members
       even constructed Pogue  vapor  carburetors  modeled   after  Pogue's
       patent papers. To  the best of my knowledge none of the systems were
       ever produced commercially except  for a remake of the fish variable
       jet single barrel carburetor. The following is a summary of the
       typical systems.

       Air Cleaner Vapor System
       ------------------------
       This device was  constructed  from  the  an  air  cleaner   and  was
       successfully used on  a  1970  Volvo.  Basically,  fuel  was  pumped
       directly into the air cleaner through  a  fitting on the side of the
       air cleaner's body. The air filter was removed and  the  empty space
       inside the air  cleaner was filled with a coarse steel wool in order
       to increase the surface area of the device. This enhanced the fuel
       evaporation. A stand pipe was fitted  through  the bottom of the air
       cleaner and allowed  about  half an inch of fuel to  remain  in  the
       bottom of the air cleaner. The stand pipe returned the overflow fuel
       to the fuel tank.

       The air cleaner  had two additional features. The cover was modified
       such that a  gap  of approximately  one  quarter  inch  was  present
       between the cover and the body in order to facilitate  air  flow  to
       the throat of   the  carburetor.  This  prevented  the  device  from
       delivering a chronically rich mixture.  The  hold  down screw on the
       cover was also spring loaded so that the device did  not blow itself
       apart when one of the frequent backfires occurred.

       The main problem with this device, other than being a bomb, was that
       sudden accelerations or  decelerations,  had a tendency to cause the
       standing fuel in the bottom of the  air cleaner to slosh up and into
       the throat of the carburetor.  This would cause the engine to

                                      Page 1





       accelerate with a rich mixture. After the engine speed had increased
       the additional fuel  was  burned  and  the  mixture immediately went
       lean. This would usually cause a  back  fire  that  would  sometimes
       flash out of the air cleaner. The hood of this car showed definite
       signs of having contained engine compartment fires.

       Fuel Tank Vapor System
       ------------------------
       This system used the fuel tank to generate the vapor.   Basically, a
       restriction was built into the air horn of the air cleaner. The area
       behind the restriction  resulted  in  a  pressure  drop.  A two inch
       diameter hose was run from behind  the  restriction  to a fitting on
       the top of  the  fuel  tank.  The fuel tank was vented  to  the  air
       through a hole in the fuel tank cap.

       This system was  installed  on  a  mid  sixties  Lincoln. The system
       actually ran quite well at first.  The  initial  problem  would show
       itself after about thirty minutes of running at which  time  the car
       would slow down  and  stall. The problem was fuel starvation. As the
       gasoline evaporated from the fuel  tank,  the temperature inside the
       tank was lowered. This happens because the fuel that evaporates take
       on heat as part of the process.

       The evaporation process  was  so  efficient  that   the  tank  would
       actually have a  layer  of  frost  on  the outside. This problem was
       solved by welding a section of exhaust  pipe on the side of the fuel
       tank and by routing a coil of copper tubing inside  the tank. Engine
       exhaust was routed  along  side the tank via an exhaust cutout valve
       that was manually operated when the engine was first started.  After
       the engine was warmed up, heat was  transferred  inside the tank via
       hot water from the engine through a heater control valve.

       The next problem that occurred was after the developer had about two
       thousand miles on the system. The fuel gage slowly  stopped going to
       empty. The reason  was  that  only  the lighter volatiles were being
       evaporated. Gasoline is not a single  component  fuel. It is made up
       of several dozen liquids, each with it's own boiling point. What was
       left in the  tank looked like a dirty mixture of STP.  This  problem
       was solved by  switching  to  alcohol. Alcohol is a single component
       fuel and boils off at one temperature. The system seemed to work
       fine after than  but  experienced   difficulties   during  our  mild
       winters.

       Heat Induction System
       ------------------------
       This system used the principle that adding heat to  the  fuel  would
       allow it to  vaporize  more  easily.  This  system  used a length of
       copper tubing wrapped around the exhaust  manifold.  The tubing then
       ran to the top of the engine and was wound around the fuel line. The
       fuel line wrap  was insulated with Fiberglas and foil  in  order  to
       preserve the maximum  amount  of  heat  transfer.  I  installed this
       system onto my truck and it actually  increased my mileage about 8%.
       There was however  a  side effect. During warm weather  it  promoted
       vapor locks in  the fuel line between the pump and the carburetor. I
       ran the system on and off over a two month period and finally
       disconnected it because of the vapor lock problem.

       Magnetic System
       ------------------------
       This system used  what  were called Cow Magnets. These are large bar
       magnets that, believe it not, farmers  are  suppose  to slide down a
       cow's throat so  that pieces of metal are captured  in  the  stomach
       instead of clumping up in the intestines. I myself have never seen a
       farmer try to  slide  anything  down  a  cow's  throat.  Anyway, the
       magnets were taped on opposite sides  of  the  fuel line between the
       fuel pump and the carburetor. The developer claimed that ions in the
       gasoline were somehow  changed  and  the fuel would  evaporate  more
       easier. I never installed this system and had never talked to anyone
       other than the developer who had.

       Moisture Injection System
       ------------------------
       This system used  a  metal or plastic container that contained water
       or a water alcohol mixture. A hole  was  drilled  in  the  cap and a
       length of plastic tubing with an air stone was placed  in the bottle
       and exited through  the  hole.  A second hole in the cap contained a
       length of plastic  tubing  that vented  the  bottle  to  the  intake
       manifold. An aquarium air valve was placed in the  vacuum  line  and
       used to adjust  the  volume  of moisture laden air that was injected
       into the intake manifold. I installed this system on several of my
       trucks and a car. What I observed was not so much an increase in gas
       mileage but a decrease in pinging.  This  could be attributed to the
       octane level of  the gasoline being raised from the  moisture.  Ever
       notice how much better your car seems to run in the fog?

       Propane Carburetor
       ------------------------
       A friend and  myself  used a propane carburetor that metered alcohol
       vapor to the engine. We used a heating  element  from  a  coffee cup
       heater mounted in  a  closed  metal container.  This  system  worked
       quite well. The draw back was trying to find an economical source of
       high proof alcohol.

       Conclusions
       ------------------------
         1. The  public  at  large will never drive a car with a bomb under
            the hood as so many of the air cleaner devices proved to be.

         2. Alcohol is a good fuel but hard  to find and expensive in large
            quantities.

         3. Don't  depend  on  a  hand  crafted  system   for   every   day
            transportation.

         4. People  who  do  research in high mileage carburetors are as or
            more paranoid than people who  are into political conspiracies.
            I stayed active in the Carburetor Union for about  three  years
            and I  could  tell immediately when someone felt that they were
            onto something. When that happened they would drop out of sight
            for several months because they  were  afraid that someone else
            would steal their idea. They usually came back  to  the  public
            meetings when  their device either blew up or it didn't work at
            all.

         5. My opinion is that doing research  into  free energy devices is
            more along the lines that most KeelyNet people should be into.

            When the  first  free energy device spreads across the networks
            the world as we know it will  change  forever.  When any person
            can construct a device that supplies their energy requirements,
            the professional pols will be powerless and power  will  placed
            back into the hands of the people. Keep the faith.
