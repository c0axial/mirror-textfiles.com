                                 SCALAR TECHNOLOGY
                                  MASS VS. ENERGY

                             [ E=MC^2 :: E=MC^*<-2-> ]

                              UNIFIED FIELD EQUATION

       When I first  started  writing  articles  on  scalar  technology  in
       Extraordinary Science three years  ago I received phone calls asking
       if I thought  Einstein's  equation  E=MC^2  was  wrong   or  somehow
       incorrect?  At that  time I did not find fault with the equation and
       said it was correct as is. Something  did  not look right, but I did
       not know enough at that time to put my finger on just what it was.

       Due to new developments in our research, we now feel  we  know  what
       was missing in  the  original  equation. The original equation still
       stands true but is lacking an in-depth  description  of factors that
       up to now were taken as just understood or unrelated as the equation
       stands alone.

       Gravity is a curved flow of SPACE/TIME. That is to  say  gravity  is
       the geometry of  space/time  flow  where  Matter  takes  on a linear
       vectorial motion known as Time. Since  one  is  made up of the other
       this now introduces two new factors to the equation.  The one factor
       known as TIME  and  is  the whole basis of what relativity is formed
       around. Maybe not actual time but  more  so  its  effect relative to
       where one is viewing the event taking place at that instant of time.

       Let me give a very common example of what I mean. When  one looks at
       a distant star,  he  or  she  is  actually looking at a natural time
       machine. The events of that light  from  that  star  may  have taken
       place thousands upon thousands of years before the observer actually
       looks up and sees the light as it reaches earth. At  186K  miles/sec
       [distance/speed] that actual  light  has  long  passed and that star
       might not even be in existence anymore.

       An even more common example would  be  right  here  on earth in most
       peoples livingrooms: the television set. Let's say,  there  are  two
       observers in the room. Observer A and observer B are both looking at
       the same set at the exact same instant. Is it the wave property or a
       photon particle property that strikes the eyes of both A and B at

                                      Page 1





       the same instant?  It  does not matter if it is the wave property or
       the particle property [duality] that  is taking over. The event will
       always be different  in  time  depending on where each  observer  is
       sitting even though ever so slightly different.

       If it were  a  wave  property, the time would be almost undetectable
       but still slightly different in  a  moment  of  time.  If it  were a
       particle property then  the  photon  that strikes  the  eye  of  one
       observer cannot be  the  exact  same photon that strikes the eyes of
       the second and so forth. Now why is this so important? It introduces
       TIME as a variable factor in our  energy  to  matter  or  matter  to
       energy equation [E=MC^2 :: E=MC^*<-2->].

       Until now, this  time  factor has just been taken  for  granted  and
       thought of as  understood.  The problem with this assumption is that
       at least three if not more, types of time exist:

           1)  Present time where a conjugate  wave  of  light goes back on
               itself to the source,
           2)  negative time where events are perceived in the past, and
           3)  positive time where events are predicted and  take  place in
               the future.

       The key to understanding Einstein's original equation E=MC^2 lies in
       understanding what Einstein  understood but others were only able to
       speculate on. That understanding  lies  in  just what is the process
       called MASS. At  what  point does energy become MASS,  and  at  what
       point does mass become ENERGY? We all know that mass [solid objects]
       are all made  up of energy but what or where is the changeover point
       from one to the other? We also know  that  supposedly nothing can go
       faster than light [186K miles/sec].  If this is true  then just what
       did Einstein mean by C2 in his famous equation E=MC^2?

       By definition C2  means  C [186K miles/sec] times C [186K miles/sec]
       which would equal 3.4596e+10 miles/sec.   This  would be much faster
       than C as we know it. How can this be?  What point  are  we  missing
       that Einstein understood?  The following is an understanding of just
       what Mass and time are as derived  from  scalar technology which may
       shed light on this matter.

       TIME is the linear motion of energy changing position  from point to
       point along its  world  line  (Vector).  The  period in which energy
       changes position is known as frequency.

       MASS is the  counter-rotating  birotational  (nonlinear)  motion  of
       energy which must  be  considered a matter particle  at  this  point
       without respect to  a  world  line  (Nonvectorial). Mass experiences
       time and gives up energy as it travels  through  space, but inherent
       time is cancelled within itself by the positive and negative aspects
       of BIROTATIONAL EQUILIBRIUM as a singularity.

       Interaction with energy,   loss   or   gain,   produces    frequency
       oscillations and thus  time  for  mass because it produces change in
       the mass particle. As a particle of  mass  decays, it returns energy
       to the energy cycle. Therefore, mass may be thought  of as energy in
       a "semi-frozen" oriented form or as a multi-dimensional hologram.

                          [ Summation symbol sub L = 0 ]

                            ROTATIONAL EQUILIBRIUM [1]

                 No TIME exists within the matter particle itself.
              (No Change) (Photons added/subtracted = change = time)

       This now means  that E=MC^2 has a hidden variable which till now has
       been overlooked as a real tangible factor known as TIME. To indicate
       this factor the symbols [ * ] meaning rotational and [ <-> ] meaning
       birotational or CW & CCW rotations-[vectors].

       That would make the equation E=MC^*<-2->  but  we would rather it be
       displayed as [E=MC^2 :: E=MC^*<-2-> ] so as not to  detract  or take
       away in any manner from the great work of Albert Einstein. His would
       be the simplistic  and  our equation would be the scalar form giving
       the extra dimension known as time. This now opens up Pandora's box.
       This means TIME is a real variable and may be engineered the same as
       matter to energy and the counterpart  which  is  still  unproven but
       known to exist, energy to matter.

       The following are  postulates derived by experimentation  and  study
       done into plotting  the  fields  in  scalar  technology.  Pay  close
       attention to the wording.

             *Postulates from York's New Unified Field Theory*

         1.  Energy to mass stages

             a.  Motion produces an arc ->
                 arc produces a vortex ->
                 vortex produces polarity ->
                 opposing polarity produces charge->
                 charge produces lattice ->
                 lattice produces structure ->
                 structure produces form

         2.  Orientation between Maxwellian and basic time continuum

             a.  Mass [birotational energy] normally has oscillatory
                 motion in nature.

               * Ex: Electrons in motion in an antenna.  [RF radiation]

               * Ex: Energy with oscillatory motion would be a laser or
                     [photon] oscillatory motion.

             b.  Energy [linear] normally  has  bilateral rotational motion
                 in nature.

               * Ex: An electron [mass particle]  is an example  of  energy
                     [photon particles]    still    unaccepted    but   our
                     interpretation of the makeup of an Electron itself.

               * Ex: Of mass bilateral  rotation  would  be  a  Tesla  coil
                     producing longitudinal  waves.  [RC]  -  Reciprocating
                     Current

         3.  Mass vs. Energy

             a.  Counter-rotating orbital rotational energy = MASS

               * In our equation[ E=MC^2 :: E=MC^*<-2-> ].
                 Note: This is what C^*<-2-> represents.

             b.  Electrons may consist of counter-rotating orbital photons

               * The  upper  rotating  cluster [direction of electron flow]
                 has more photons than the  lower counter-rotating cluster.
                 The true  form is that of a Chaotic Streamline  guided  by
                 the Hopf Ellipse. [2]

             c. *  The  force  on the poles of the counter-rotating orbital
                  photons is at 45 degrees  to  the  magnetic  pole  of the
                  electron which  they  make  up,  a part  of  the  optical
                  property of photons.

             d. *  Photons have orbital motion in a magnetic field and just
                  spin as a singularity.

         4.  Maxwellian vs. Einsteinian

             a.  Free electrons = electrostatic field

             b.  Orbital electrons = space/time displacement = WEAK Force

             c.  Alignment of space/time displacement [orbital
                 electrons] = STRONG Force

         5.  Gyroscopic action

             a.  Gyroscopic action fixes/sets re-orientation of
                 space/time within one relativity consisting
                 of at least four dimensions.

                 * Orbital rotation is gyroscopic action.

         6.  Constants vs. non-constants

             a.  The speed of light is not constant.

              * We are limited to the detection  of  events at the speed of
                light in  our relativity. EX: Take a wide  flat  rubberband
                and mark  one  inch  on  it to represent 186K mps [speed of
                light]

             b.  The distance of a speed  of  light is constant relative to
                 its frame of reference.

              * Now  stretch the rubberband and mark on  a  flat  piece  of
                paper the new length of the DISTANCE of the speed of light.
                The new extended line is still the distance of the speed of
                light, but  the speed relative to the unstretched line must
                be FTL  because  we are  still  using  the  line  from  our
                original relativity.  [4D]



                                      Page 4





         7.  Energy/Mass/Time/Space

             a.  Mass traveling at or near the  speed of light does not
                 actually become  infinite but only SEEMS to from the  view
                 of the observer [A] and  nothing has actually changed from
                 the view of [B] the observer doing the motion except [DSL]
                 the distance of the speed of light.

              * Special  Relativity is not needed to explain  this  action.
                The observation  of mass reaching infinity by [A] is due to
                space/time being  stretched   and   bent   around  [B]  the
                traveler.

             b.  All matter stretches [alters] space/TIME  [the distance of
                 the speed of light] as one passes through the other.

              * The  time  is what is altered [stretched] not the amount of
                space itself. This process  is  known as time lensing. This
                is also known as perception.  [To perceive  you   must have
                change]

             c.  Light-shift/frequency-spectrum  is due to the SLUSH effect
                 of space/time [lensing].

             d.  Frequency = Angle  of bent space/time

              * Bent space/time acts as a prism for color separation

         8.  Mathematical assumptions in true relativity

             a.  In more than one relativity  [4D]  Mathematically, actions
                 are NOT ADDITIVE but are a PRODUCT of each other.
                 Ex:C^2 In relativity [singular or one set  of  4D] actions
                 are mathematically additives except for the speed of light
                 itself.
                 Ex: [C'  +  C'] Note: C'= one set distance of the speed of
                 light within one singular or prime relativity.

         9.  Gravity -  Unification field

             a.  Gravity is a PROCESS  not  a  particle.  A push-pull force
                 [pump]. It is more of a PUSH  than a pull force.

              * This is part of the distance squared law.   If  you  are at
                the arc  of  the  field flow it is a PUSH and if you are in
                closer to the mass you are in the counter-rotating flow and
                it is a PULL force. [ButterflyField-Pattern]

       We feel these  postulates  are the  basic  building  blocks  of  our
       fundamental particles. We do not feel gravitons or  quarks  exist as
       sub-particles and no such evidence has been brought forward beyond a
       shadow of a  doubt  to  prove the QCD concept. The photon itself has
       pre-energy levels which is beyond  the  scope  of this paper at this
       time. The postulates  and concepts are far from being  finished  and
       work is currently advancing in a positive direction.
