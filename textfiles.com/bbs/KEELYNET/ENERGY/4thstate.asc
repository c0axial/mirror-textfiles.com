       Book Review by Joel McClain

       Believe it or  not,  I found this  book  in  the  Waxahachie  Public
       Library, while researching  references to plasma.   Having  built  a
       Tesla coil to  ionize a plasma tube, and subsequently having watched
       as the driver melted, I was curious to learn more about the nature

                                      Page 1





       of plasma.

       What I did  not  expect to find was a reference and description of a
       plasma based free-energy generator,  which was operated successfully
       over twenty years ago.  The terminology for this type  of  generator
       is a "MHD"  generator, which is the acronym for MagnetoHydroDynamic.
       To understand how it works, it is  first necessary to understand the
       nature of plasma, and why it is so special among gases.

       The three accepted  states  of  matter  are, as we  all  learned  in
       school, solid, liquid  and  gas.   A  plasma is a gas which conducts
       electricity.  This small difference  is  the reason why the universe
       exists, why lightning  flashes,  and  how  the sun generates  light.
       Plasmas exist in the air that we breathe, but in small proportion to
       other gases.  A  large  elestrostatic  or electro-magnetic potential
       will cause the gases to conduct,  and  that  conduction  is commonly
       known as lightning.

       Those gases which,  under  stress, conduct, are also  called  "noble
       gases", because they  do not form molecules with other gases.  These
       gases all produce differing colors  of light when ionized, hence the
       colored neon advertising signs which we commonly see used.  Ionizing
       is the process by which electrons are knocked free from their atoms,
       leaving the atom with a net positive charge.  In an  ionized gas, or
       plasma, the billions   of   particle  collisions  which  result  are
       responsible for the glow of light.

       The first "glow tubes" were invented by Sir William Crookes in 1879,
       who was the first to realize that  there  exists  a  fourth state of
       matter.  Credit is  also given to other pioneers in  electrical  and
       research, such as  Lord Ernest Rutherford, Luigi Galvani, Allesandro
       Volta, Michael Faraday,  Heinrich   Hertz,   Wilhelm   Roentgen  and
       Guglielmo Marconi, and  descriptions  of  their  contributions   are
       provided.

       The sun has  recently  been recognized as a MHD generator, and as of
       this book's publication, working  models  were  based  upon  the sun
       itself.  In the  Mark  V,  for  example,  plasmas were  elevated  in
       temperature and pumped  past a magnetic field, creating an immediate
       DC potential.  Because the sun has  a  magnetic  field,  we  see the
       ionization as light.  However, we do not have the ability  to breach
       the "Coulomb Barrier",  or  did  not as of the writing of this book.
       The sun can breach the barrier, and  force  protons,  which normally
       repel, together.  In  this  way,  the  sun  converts  hydrogen  into
       helium, which is a noble gas, and thus creates the plasma effect.

       We attempt to   stress   the   gases   in   other   ways,   such  as
       electrostatically, because we   cannot   duplicate   the   heat  and
       pressures found in  the  core  of the sun.  In this,  we  have  been
       successful.  The Mark  V  was the first successful generator of this
       type, capable of 32 million watts  of  output,  of  which 10 million
       watts were required to keep it running, for a NET GAIN of 22 million
       watts.

       The Mark V program was funded by the DOD, which needed  a high-power
       electrical generator for  wind  tunnel  testing  of spacecraft.  The
       Mark V was also capable of producing  600  million  watts, for brief
       periods of up to three minutes, ideal for the tests  of  that  time.
       Further developments must have occurred since that time, but of

                                      Page 2





       those, we know nothing.

       However, this creation  of  a  pollution-free  energy source did not
       escape the attention of the politicians of the day.  The White House
       Science Advisor appointed a panel,  headed  by Louis H. Roddis, Vice
       Chairman of Consolidated Edison of New York, to study  MHD  and make
       recommendations.  In 1969,    the   panel   issued   their   report,
       recommending a full-scale   national    program   to   utilize   MHD
       generators.  The plan was to include the Department of the Interior,
       the nation's utility  companies,  as well as the companies  building
       MHD generators.  This  was  news  to me, and I guess it also escaped
       the press and other media sources of that time, and since then.

       America was not alone in MHD research.  At the time, the Soviets had
       the most aggressive MHD research  program.   In  1969,  the Japanese
       announced that they had developed a MHD generator which  was powered
       by a superconducting electromagnet.  It is safe to assume that those
       programs have progressed substantially in the past two decades.

       It is the  author's  contention that it is up to the people to guide
       the world toward MHD based energy, an opinion which is shared by the
       reviewer.  This energy can effectively  end  hunger  and war, and is
       far too important  to  be  left  in  the  hands  of  scientists  and
       politicians.  Claiming ignorance of science is no excuse...speak out
       and vote if  you want to see change, OR DO NOTHING and LEARN TO LIVE
       with pollution and poverty and war.

       Other topics covered in this amazing book include:

               1.  Astronomy; birth and death of stars
               2.  The sun, sunspots and solar flares
               3.  Plasmas for space flight
               4.  Heavy water for fusion (cold fusion? YES!)
               5.  Magnetic Mirrors and Magnetic Wells

       This book, despite its small size, includes ample illustrations, and
       is written in layman terminology.   It  is  AN INSTANT REFUTATION to
       those who claim that free energy is not possible.   It  is  not only
       possible, it has  been  done,  and  you  paid  for  it with your tax
       dollars!  I heartily recommend this  book  for  all,  not just those
       interested in science, plasma or ZPE, because if enough  people read
       it, we may yet see MHD generators popping up in our world.

       Vangard Note..

           Joel found  this  remarkable  book  and  did the above review so
           everyone could track their own copy....if you don't have it, GET
           IT!  It will open your eyes to  much  of  the  future technology
           possibilities having to do with plasmas.  Are  they  so  EXOTIC?
           No, everytime  you  turn  on  a  fluorescent light or see a neon
           tube, you are looking at a plasma.   These  are the low pressure
           versions but  pump it up, move it through a magnetic  field  and
           SHAZAAM!, you have a generator!!!!

           I think  it  would  be useful to present the section relating to
           power generation devices using plasmas in the MHD configuration.

       From the GIFT FROM THE SKY section

       The science of  plasma  physics is a new technology that will change
       your life.  Use of plasma technologies  can  help  to  build a world
       that's free from hunger and want, free from pollution,  a  world  in
       which man can   generate   ALL  THE  ENERGY  HE  NEEDS  to  run  his
       civilization and yet still live IN  HARMONY  with the environment, a
       world in which  man can set out in earnest for the farthest  reaches
       of the solar system and perhaps even challenge the stars themselves.

       But this beautiful  world  of the future won't come about by itself,
       automatically.  IF IT HAPPENS AT  ALL,  it  will  be because men and
       women MAKE IT HAPPEN.  To a large extent, it's up to  you.   Even if
       you don't intend  to be a scientist or engineer, you will be a voter
       and YOUR DECISIONS can help to SHAPE  THE  FUTURE  of ALL TECHNOLOGY
       (can we say ALTERNATIVES?????).  Informed, thoughtful  citizens  can
       make certain that  the  benefits  of science and technology are used
       wisely, for the good of all the people.   Those  who  ignore science
       and technology, who dismiss it as something beyond  their grasp, are
       DOOMED TO HAVE  OTHERS  MAKE  THEIR  DECISIONS  FOR  THEM  (are  you
       conspiracy buffs reading this?).   This  book  is an introduction to
       plasma physics and technology, written to give you  a  glimpse  of a
       possible future -  YOUR  future  -  so that you can make up your own
       mind about this exciting NEW science (written in 1971).

       Plasma is a fourth state of matter, quite different from the solids,
       liquids and gases  we're familiar  with.   Most  people  don't  even
       realize that plasmas exist.  When they think of a fluorescent  lamp,
       they don't realize  that  it's  PLASMA  energy that makes it bright.
       When a rocket bellows off its launching  pad,  it's PLASMA streaming
       from the exhaust nozzles, NOT GAS.  When a nuclear  bomb spreads its
       searing fireball, it's   plasma   that's  destroying  everything  it
       touches.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       PLASMAS FOR POWER

       The world faces a critical dilemma.

       Modern civilization depends on energy.   You have at your fingertips
       more energy than  a  Roman  Emporer  could command from  a  thousand
       slaves: energy from  electricity, for the most part.  This energy is
       more than a convenience, it's a way  of  life.   Anyone  who's lived
       through a power  blackout  knows  how  modern  civilization  depends
       totally on electrical energy.

       Yet despite this enormous demand for more electrical power, it seems
       clear that we  cannot  continue  to  build  more and more electrical
       power-generation plants.

       One problem is pollution.  Power-generation  plants  produce air and
       water pollution.  In many parts of the United States,  the pollution
       load is already   far   more   than  it  should  be.   Pollution  is
       threatening to alter  the very basic  ecology  of  our  planet.   If
       unchecked,  pollution will ultimately make this world unlivable.

       Another problem is  simply  that  you  can't  keep   building  power
       stations indefinitely.  If the demand for electrical power continues
       to grow, we  can  picture a world covered with power stations, using
       all the coal, oil, natural gas, uranium, thorium and any other kind

                                      Page 4





       of fuel that  exists on our planet.  And the demand is rising faster
       than new power plants can be built.  There have already been serious
       blackouts over large parts of the  United  States.  Even more common
       are "brownouts," where electricity is rationed so that everybody may
       have enough to live on, while nobody gets as much as he wants.

       These problems are, at heart, problems of EFFICIENCY.  The pollution
       that power stations produce is a function of their  efficiency;  the
       more efficient the power-generation process, the fewer stations will
       be needed.  High  efficiency stations will be better able to keep up
       with the growing demand for power than stations of lower efficiency.

       There are tremendous energies locked in plasmas.  Can these energies
       be tapped to provide abundant, pollution-free, efficient power?

       Ever since Bethe announced that the  sun is a thermonuclear reactor,
       men have dreamed of producing CONTROLLED thermonuclear reactors HERE
       ON EARTH.  Such  FUSION reactors could supply a virtually  LIMITLESS
       amount of cheap,  clean  power.  Many of the world's best scientists
       are working hard  toward  fusion   reactors.    But   the   task  is
       formidable, and results may not be forthcoming in the century.

       What do we do in the meantime?

       Plasma dynamics  offers another opportunity: the magnetohydrodynamic
       generator.  Tapping the  power of a stream of plasma, MHD generators
       have been built for experimental purposes.  They work NOW.  And when
       fully developed, they  promise  to  produce  electricity  with  much
       higher efficiency and  much  less pollution than conventional  power
       stations can offer.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       FROM FARADAY TO MHD

       Michael Faraday discovered  the basic principles of electrical power
       generation about a century and a  half  ago.   He showed that when a
       material that conducts  electricity  is  set  in  motion  THROUGH  a
       magnetic field, an electric current is generated.

       Thomas Edison (1847-1931)  turned  Faraday's  laboratory  work  into
       practical reality.  In 1882 he showed  the  world  that  electricity
       could be generated reliably and in sufficient quantity TO LIGHT UP A
       CITY!  Within a  few  decades  most  industrial machinery,  lighting
       systems, communications, home  appliances,  and now even heating and
       air-conditioning units have  been   based  on  the  availability  of
       inexpensive, abundant electrical power.

       Edison's generators (or  dynamos,  as they were called)  didn't  use
       plasmas.  Even if  Edison had known about MHD he couldn't have built
       an MHD generator.  There was no way  to  produce the amount of high-
       temperature plasma that an MHD generator requires.  And no materials
       that could hold the plasma without being destroyed.

       The heart of  Edison's dynamo was a bundle of copper  wires,  called
       the ARMATURE.  The  armature  was  spun rapidly in a magnetic field.
       Being a conductor of electricity  in  motion  relative to a magnetic
       field, the armature had an electric current induced  in  it.   Other
       coils of copper,  called  BRUSHES,  tapped the current and fed it to
       the outside world.


                                      Page 5





       During the first  decade or so after Edison's initial success, there
       was a battle  between those who wanted  to  build  electrical  power
       systems that produced  direct  current  (DC) and those  who  thought
       alternating current (AC)  was  preferable  (Tesla and Westinghouse).
       For reasons we needn't go into here,  the  AC  proponents  won.  The
       power you buy today comes in a form where the electrons that make up
       the current alternate their flow direction sixty  times  per  second
       (60 cycle AC).

       Modern generators, after  nearly a century of development, are still
       based on Edison's design.  The heart  of  the  modern  generator was
       built at the  turn  of the century or is a brand-new  nuclear  power
       plant.  And despite intensive engineering efforts, powerplants based
       on such generators  seem  limited  to  efficiencies of about 40%, AT
       BEST!

       A source of mechanical energy is needed  to  make the armature turn.
       Modern generators use  turbines  to provide mechanical  energy.   In
       most systems, steam is used to turn the turbine.  Hydroelectric dams
       use falling water   to  spin  the  turbines.   And,  more  recently,
       generators using gas  turbine  engines   (similar  to  aircraft  jet
       engines) have come into use for special purposes.

       The steam turbine plant is the type that generates  the overwhelming
       majority of the  world's  electrical  power.   It begins with a heat
       source, to boil water and make steam.   The  heat  source  can  be a
       furnace that burns fossil fuel - coal, oil, natural  gas  -  or  the
       heat source could  be  a nuclear reactor.  It's ironic that the most
       advanced source of  energy that man's  been  able  to  develop,  the
       energy of fissioning atoms, is used for nothing more  glamorous than
       boiling water!

       In a conventional power generator, we start with heat energy (fossil
       fuel or nuclear), which is converted to steam.  The steam PUSHES the
       turbine blades.  The  mechanical  energy  of  the  turbine  is  then
       converted by the armature into electrical  energy.  The generator is
       thus an ENERGY  CONVERSION  device,  converting  heat   energy  into
       mechanical energy, and   then   mechanical  energy  INTO  ELECTRICAL
       ENERGY!

       Back to Faraday for a moment.  Remember,  he  didn't discover merely
       that a copper  armature rotating in a magnetic field  WILL  GENERATE
       ELECTRICITY.  Most emphatically not.  He made the MUCH MORE PROFOUND
       discovery that ANY  conductor  of  electricity  MOVING RELATIVE TO A
       MAGNETIC FIELD will generate electricity.

       PLASMAS are CONDUCTORS OF ELECTRICITY!
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       THE MHD GENERATOR

       Faraday understood the basic principles  of  MHD  interactions.   In
       fact, he tried  to measure the electrical currents  flowing  in  the
       River Thames.  He  reasoned  that  the  river  was  fairly salty and
       therefore a reasonable conductor of  electricity.   And as it flowed
       to the sea, it was moving to the Earth's magnetic field.   Could  he
       measure the current that MUST BE FLOWING through it?

       The answer was  a  definite  NO.  The Earth's magnetic field is much
       too weak, the flow of the river was too slow, and the conductivity

                                      Page 6





       of salty water FAR too low, to show a measurable current.

       In an MHD  generator,  we'll  see that three basic factors determine
       the performance of  the  generator;  plasma  conductivity,  magnetic
       field strength, and  the  plasma's flow speed, MHD  engineers  would
       like to have all three as high as possible.

       Although some plasmas  are  much  better conductors than salt water,
       they're still far from the conductivities  of most metals.  The best
       man-made plasmas have  conductivities  that  are   several   hundred
       thousand times lower  than  that of copper.  However, plasmas can be
       made to move at supersonic speeds,  and magnets can produce hundreds
       of thousands OF GAUSS.  And, as we'll see shortly,  there's  a trick
       that can GREATLY ENHANCE the conductivity of a plasma, too.

       If you move  a  plasma  through  a  magnetic field, it's possible to
       generate an electrical current DIRECTLY  FROM  THE  PLASMA.  You can
       by-pass the whole mechanical system of turbines and  armatures  that
       conventional generators need.   The MHD generator is called a DIRECT
       CONVERSION device: it converts heat  energy  directly to electricity
       without having a mechanical stage in between.

       In principle, the  MHD  generator  is quite simple.   There  are  NO
       mechanical moving parts,  ONLY  THE PLASMA MOVES.  The MHD generator
       is basically a pipe, surrounded by  a  magnetic  field coil.  At one
       end of the  pipe  is  a  heat source: at the other end,  an  exhaust
       stack.  Electrodes in the pipe tap off the current that's generated.

       The MHD generator produces DC power ONLY.  Various schemes have been
       tried for making  AC  generators,  but  to  date  the  simplest  and
       cheapest way to produce AC is to convert  the MHD generator's output
       in a conventional inverter.

       Before we can  understand  how  the  MHD  generator  can  be  almost
       completely free of  pollution,  we must look at the generator itself
       more closely.

       The plasma is  produced  in  the   heat  source  by  simple  THERMAL
       IONIZATION.  That is,  the  heat  raises  the  temperature   of  the
       molecules to the  point  where  ELECTRONS BREAK FREE.  The resulting
       plasma is only  SLIGHTLY  ionized,   even  in  the  hottest  burners
       available today.  There  are other ways to ionize  a  gas,  such  as
       using electrical fields   or   ultraviolet   light   to  excite  the
       electrons.  In practical  MHD  generators,   though,   the   thermal
       ionization is the simplest and cheapest technique.

       The plasma runs through the pipe - which we'll call  the MHD CHANNEL
       from now on.  The plasma is forced through the channel by simple gas
       pressure, much like  the situation in a rocket nozzle.  As we'll see
       throughout this chapter, there are many similarities between the MHD
       generator and rocket engines.  In fact, the MHD generator can almost
       be thought of as a way to produce electricity from a rocket.

       The magnetic field  is  arranged   to  run  perpendicularly  to  the
       direction of the  plasma  flow.   As  Faraday  showed,  an  electric
       current is generated in a direction that's perpendicular to both the
       magnetic field and the plasma flow.

       EFFICIENCY AND PROBLEMS

       The MHD generator  offers the possibility of much higher efficiences
       than turbogenerator poower plants.   The  best  steam turbogenerator
       plants are barely more than 40% efficient.  Modern  nuclear stations
       are less than 35% efficient.  Calculations have shown that the first
       MHD power stations  will  be  at least 50% efficient.  Moreover, the
       MHD system will  be  open  to  further  improvements.   Conventional
       turbogenerators have been  refined  for  nearly a century  to  reach
       their present-day level;  it's  doubtful  that they'll be capable of
       any significant further development.

       Even better, though, is the advantage  of  SCALING.   By its nature,
       the MHD generator  becomes  MORE  EFFICIENT as its  size  INCREASES.
       Losses in the  MHD  generator are mostly associated with the CHANNEL
       WALLS - friction between the walls and the flowing plasma, heat loss
       TO the walls  and  the  flowing plasma,  heat  lost  to  the  walls,
       electrode losses and other effects.  The power output,  on the other
       hand, is a product of the VOLUME of the plasma in the channel.  This
       means that as  the  size  of  an MHD generator INCREASES, the losses
       rise with the square of the size (two-dimensional wall effect) while
       the power output rises with the cube  of the size (three-dimensional
       volume effect).  This  "three-halves" relationship  means  that  the
       BIGGER the generator, the BETTER its efficiency.

       Now look at thermal efficiency.  All generators are essentially HEAT
       ENGINES, and the  amount  of  energy  you  can  EXTRACT from them is
       DIRECTLY RELATED to the TEMPERATURE  DIFFERENCE  between the hottest
       and coldest ends of the system.  In engineering practice, this means
       that it's desirable  to operate with as high a peak  temperature  as
       possible.

       Turbines are limited  in  the  peak temperature they can handle.  If
       the gas blowing across the turbine  blades  is  TOO  HOT, the blades
       will be destroyed.  Despite the refinements of the  toughest  modern
       metal alloys and  the  best  designs,  turbines are still limited to
       operating temperatures well below  800  degress Kelvin (1000 degress
       Fahrenheit).

       MHD generators operate  today  at  top temperatures  of  about  3000
       degress Kelvin.  They  can  easily  achieve peak temperatures beyond
       the fondest dreams of turbine engineers.   This  is  both  the great
       strength and main headache of MHD power generation.

       For the MHD  generator  NEEDS these very high temperatures.   Unless
       the plasma fed  into  the  generator  is  sufficiently  ionized, its
       conductivity will be TOO LOW to allow  the  generator  to work.  And
       the easiest way  to  ionize a large CONTINUOUS FLOW  of  gas  is  BY
       HEATING IT.

       Still, most gases  are  very  difficult  to  ionize  by heating; the
       temperatures required are VERY HIGH.   Air,  for  example,  must  be
       heated to about 4500 degrees Kelvin before a significant  percentage
       of molecules start  to  shed their electrons.  Conventional furnaces
       can't reach such a temperature.

           effectively produce power using the MHD system......Vangard)


                                      Page 8





       The way around  this  problem  was  found  by  the  American  plasma
       physicist, Richard J. Rosa (born 1927).  While a graduate student at
       Cornell University, in the mid-1950's,  he discovered that by adding
       a small amount of METALLIC material to a low-conductivity plasma, he
       could increase the  conductivity  to  a point useful  in  MHD  power
       generation.  Rosa called this technique "seeding."

       A burner operating  at 3000 degrees Kelvin can produce a plasma with
       sufficient conductivity for MHD if  the  combustion  gas is "seeded"
       with a small  amount  of  metallic  powder.   Potassium   salts  are
       commonly used as  "seed"  material  in  large  MHD  generators.   In
       smaller machines, the more expensive  metal  cesium  is  often used.
       The reason behind  the "seeding" technique is that  the  metals  are
       ionized QUITE READILY  at  temperatures where gases hardly ionize at
       all.  So most of the free electrons  in  an  MHD  generator's plasma
       stream come from the metallic "seed."

       While conventional burners  can reach temperatures  useful  to  MHD,
       nuclear reactors can't.    This   may   seem   strange,   since  the
       temperature within the fission elements  of  a  reactor,  where  the
       atomic nuclei are  splitting  apart and releasing  energy,  must  be
       astronomically high.  But  nuclear  reactors  are designed to run at
       low-temperature: less than  2000   degrees  Kelvin.   If  the  metal
       casings that hold  the  fissionable  material get much  hotter  than
       this, they may  weaken  or  even  break  apart.   This  could  cause
       destruction of the reactor (not necessarily  an explosion) and might
       permit highly radioactive  material  to  escape  from  the  shielded
       reactor core.

       Therefore, nuclear reactors   can't  deliver  the  high  temperature
       needed for an  MHD heat source.   Higher  temperature  reactors  are
       being developed, and  rocket  reactors  such  as the  ROVER  nuclear
       rocket engine have reached temperatures useful for MHD, but only for
       a very short  time.   While  nuclear reactors will probably be mated
       with MHD generators sometime in the  future, it seems clear that the
       earliest MHD power plants will use furnaces that burn fossil fuel.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       THE DRIVE TOWARD MHD POWER

       Faraday understood the basics of MHD, and as early  as  1910 several
       experimenters took out   patents  on  various  versions  of  an  MHD
       generator.  None of  them  were  successful,  mainly  because  their
       inventors couldn't heat the plasma to a temperature  high enough for
       sufficient ionization.

       In the late  1930's,  Bela Karlovitz (born 1904) of the Westinghouse
       Research Laboratories built an MHD  generator  of  considerable size
       and complexity.  However, it also failed to work in a practical way.
       The science of plasma physics hadn't yet reached the point where the
       details of ionization  and the dynamics of plasma interactions  with
       magnetic fields were understood well enough to design a workable MHD
       generator.

       In 1938, shortly  after  Bethe's  announcement  of  the sun's energy
       source, Arthur Kantrowitz (born 1913)  decided to study the problems
       of developing a  fusion  reactor.   He  was a gas physicist  at  the
       National Advisory Committee  for  Aeronautics  facility  in Langley,
       Virginia.  NACA was to be revamped,  twenty  years  later,  into the
       National Aeronautics and  Space Administration, NASA,  the  nation's
       space agency.
                                      Page 9





       Kantrowitz's first attempts   at  building  an  experimental  fusion
       reactor fell far short of approaching  the conditions in the core of
       the sun, as  he  had  expected.   World  War  II forced  an  end  to
       research, except for direct war-related work, and Kantrowitz devoted
       his efforts to jet-engine developments.

       By 1949 he  was an associate professor (and later full professor) at
       Cornell University.  He began to try  new ideas that might lead to a
       successful fusion reaction.   The  main  problem was  to  produce  a
       plasma of ultra-high  temperature.   Kantrowitz  developed the shock
       tube as a  laboratory  apparatus   for   producing   very  high  gas
       temperatues.  A shock tube is a length of pipe in which a shock wave
       can be driven  through  the  gas  to  be studied.   The  shock  wave
       momentarily heats the  gas to a very high temperature, in some cases
       high enough to ionize the gas significantly.

       Kantowitz soon realized that simple  shock tubes wouldn't come close
       to producing fusion temperatures.  But he also found that there were
       many intriguing things  to  investigate  in gases that  were  heated
       "only" to 10,000 degrees Kelvin or so.

       "I was diverted  from  studying  the  fusion  problem," he said in a
       conversation in 1970, "and I've been diverted from it ever since."

       One of the  causes  of  his  diversion   was  his  realization  that
       practical MHD generators might be attainable.

       Several fields of study gained tremendously during  and  after World
       War II.  One  of  them,  as  we've  seen,  was  plasma dynamics.  In
       addition, the infant  Space  Age  was  starting  to  produce  rocket
       burners and new materials that could stand up to the  fiery  heat of
       energetic plasmas.

       Between 1950 and  1955,  Kantrowitz  and  several  of  his  graduate
       students at Cornell demonstrated  that  electrical  power  could  be
       produced in a shock-tube model of an MHD generator.   In 1955, these
       men left Cornell  to establish the AVCO Everett Research Laboratory,
       in Massachusetts.  Their first objective wasn't MHD.  The laboratory
       was set up to study the missle re-entry  problem, and advise the Air
       Force as to whether or not a nose cone could be built  to  withstand
       the intense heat  of  re-entering  the  atmosphere  at nearly 30,000
       kilometers per hour.

       Much of the work on the re-entry problem  was also applicable to the
       plasma condititions inside an MHD generator.  In  1958,  Rosa  built
       the first successful  MHD generator.  Called the Mark I, it produced
       slightly more than 10 kilowatts.

       Although far from  a  practical power  plant,  the  Mark  I  was  an
       historic step.  For the first time, a sizable amount  of  electrical
       power had been  produced  FROM A PLASMA.  MHD power generation was a
       reality.

       Britain, France, Russia,  Japan,  West  Germany  and  several  other
       nations quickly embarked on MHD development programs.  In the United
       States, many industrial   firms   and  Government   and   university
       laboratories started MHD   studies.    Among   them   were   Atomics
       International, General Electric, Gulf  General Atomic, Westinghouse,
       NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Argonne National Laboratory

                                      Page 10





       (Atomic Energy Commission),     Stanford    University    and    the
       Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   The Navy and Air Force both
       set up active research programs in MHD.

       The largest and  best-publicized  program was put  forward  by  AVCO
       Corporation, under the   leadership  of  Kantrowitz,  and  with  the
       cooperation and financial support  of  a  group  of electric utility
       companies.  Starting in 1959 they embarked on a program  to  develop
       practical MHD generators for utility power stations.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       THE TWO AXIS APPROACH

       Their plan of  attack involved developing two rather different kinds
       of experimental MHD equipment, and  has  been  dubbed the "two axis"
       approach.

       Under this plan, large high-power MHD generators were  built  to run
       for only a  few seconds at a time.  The basic aim of these tests was
       to determine how a plasma behaves  under  conditions such as a full-
       sized MHD power  plant  would  require.   For this purpose,  running
       times of a  few  seconds  are perfectly adequate, because the plasma
       attains equilibrium conditions within  a  second  or  so  after  the
       burner first turns on.  That is, in about one second, the plasma has
       reached a steady-state condition.  Its physical behavior  will  stay
       the same as long as the generator operates.

       AVCO's Mark II  experimental  MHD  generator  went into operation in
       1961.  It was designed to produce  at  least  one  megawatt  (MW) of
       power output during  run  times  of  ten  seconds.    It  eventually
       produced 1.5 MW.    But   more   important,   it   produced   enough
       experimental data so that engineers could begin designing bigger MHD
       generators with full confidence that they'd perform as predicted.

       The success of the Mark II led to  the  eventual  development of the
       Mark V self-excited  MHD generator.  The Mark V had  more  than  ten
       times the power capability of the Mark II.  Its channel could handle
       a total plasma  flow  of  130  pounds per second, compared to the 11
       pounds per second of the Mark II.   And the Mark V produced 32 MW of
       total power output.   Yet  in  physical size, the Mark  V  was  only
       slightly more than  twice  the  Mark  II's dimensions.  This clearly
       showed the scaling advantages of the MHD generator.

       The Mark V was a SELF-EXCITED generator.  That is, part of the GROSS
       POWER output was  fed  into the copper  electromagnet,  TO  KEEP  IT
       RUNNING.  The magnet was started by power from a BANK  OF BATTERIES,
       but within a  few  seconds the MHD generator ITSELF was POWERING THE
       MAGNET!  The copper magnet took about 10 MW of power, leaving better
       than 20 MW available AS POWER OUTPUT!

       The Department of Defense had sponsored  development  of the Mark V.
       Once it had proven itself, the Air Force contracted  AVCO to build a
       similar MHD generator  at  the Arnold Engineering Development Center
       (AEDC) in western Tennessee.  This  time,  the  MHD generator was no
       longer to be an EXPERIMENTAL piece of apparatus.  It  was  needed to
       do a specific job.

       AEDC was developing a new type of wind tunnel, for testing advanced-
       design aircraft and  spacecraft.   The  wind  tunnel  was  nicknamed
       LORHO, which, translated from engineering jargon, meant that it was

                                      Page 11





       to be a  wind  tunnel  that  operates  at  LOW  ATMOSPHERIC DENSITY,
       capable of simulating  the low densities  found  very  high  in  the
       Earth's atmosphere.   The  Greek  letter  RHO is an aerodynamicist's
       shorthand notation for  gas  density.   Thus the low RHO wind tunnel
       become LORHO.

       The LORHO wind  tunnel  needed a burst  of  electrical  power.   The
       "pilot" facility, a small-scale model wind tunnel that would be used
       to check out the basic design concept, was going to  need  20 MW for
       up to three  minutes.   The full-scale LORHO facility would need 600
       MW.  Buying bursts of power like that  from the local utility was an
       unlikely possibility, even  though the local utility  was  the  low-
       cost, Federally-operated Tennessee   Valley   Authority  (TVA).   An
       electric power grid that's set up  to  provide  constant  power  for
       homes and industry simply can't hand over 600 MW for  a  few minutes
       at a time,  unless  some  very  expensive special equipment is built
       into the system.  And even then,  the  Air  Force  would have to run
       their wind tunnel  at off-peak hours, such as between  midnight  and
       dawn.

       An MHD generator  is ideally suited to provide a short burst of high
       power.  And, the Air Force realized, an MHD generator could be built
       right at the LORHO site and be COMPLETELY  SELF-CONTAINED.   No need
       to bother anyone off-base, including TVA.  So the "pilot"  scale  20
       MW LORHO generator was built, and HAS OPERATED as designed.

       While the Mark II, Mark V and LORHO generators tested the ability of
       MHD generators to  deliver  high  powers,  another  type  of MHD rig
       providing answers about long running times.

       AVCO's Long Duration Test Facility (LDTF) was designed to test small
       MHD generators over  time  spans  measured  in  months  rather  than
       minutes.  These long duration tests were aimed at producing  data on
       the MHD hardware   and   its   ability  to  stand  up  to  the  high
       temperatures and other problems associated  with high-speed flows of
       hot plasmas.

       The MHD equipment tested in the LDTF was purposely kept small, since
       the costs of running larger hardware would be much higher.  But even
       though the LDTF  channels were limited to 10 kilowatts  (kW)  output
       power, the channels,  electrodes,  and  other components had to face
       exactly the same temperatures, corrosion  proglems, and other plasma
       effects that a large-sized MHD generator faces.

       The LDTF used a variety of fuels, including low-quality fuel oil and
       coal, types of fuels that are rarely used in conventional generators
       because of their   corrosiveness   and  pollution   products.    MHD
       generator channels were  tested  for  hundreds  of hours, around the
       clock, without let-up.   They  showed   no  harmful  effects.   This
       evidence has led the engineers to believe that MHD  generators  will
       be able to  use  low-grade  fuels  that  currently  can't be used in
       conventional turbogenerator power stations.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       A NATIONAL MHD PROGRAM

       By 1968, enough had been learned about the design and performance of
       MHD generators to prompt the Government  into  taking a serious look
       at this promising application of plasma technology.


                                      Page 12





       The White House  Science  Advisory  appointed  a  special  panel  to
       examine the progress and prospects  for  MHD  power  generation, and
       report their findings to the Office of Science and Technology.

       In 1969, this panel, headed by Louis H. Roddis, Vice Chairman of the
       Consolidated Edison Company  of  New  York,  presented  its  report.
       Titled, "MHD for  Central  Station  Power  Generation:  a  Plan  for
       Action,"  the report outlined a  plan  for  a  national  program  to
       develop full-scale MHD  power  generation  stations.    The   report
       recommended a cooperative  program  involving the U.S. Department of
       the Interior, the nation's utility  companies,  and  the  industrial
       firms that are developing MHD generators.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       MHD POWER PLANTS

       As MHD generators  are developed and proved out at  the  high  power
       outputs and long  running  times  necessary for the electric utility
       companies, two major  types of power  plants  will  incorporate  MHD
       generators into their  design.  In utility-company  jargon,  they're
       called the PEAKING PLANT and the BASE-LOAD PLANT.

       The peaking type of operation will probably be the first to use MHD.
       An MHD generator  would be added on to a conventional turbogenerator
       plant, to be used only for short  times,  when  a  heavy  demand for
       power is being felt.  The word "peaking" thus has two  meanings;  it
       refers to the  peak  demand periods, the "rush hours" for electrical
       power; and it also refers to the  fact  that  the MHD generator will
       use the peak temperature of the TOTAL SYSTEM.

       When the MHD  generator "peaker" is in operation,  it  will  produce
       tens or perhaps hundreds of megawatts of power.  Its exhaust plasma,
       still very hot, will be used to boil water for the steam turbines in
       the rest of  the  plant.   Thus  the MHD generator ADDS TO THE TOTAL
       EFFICIENCY of the whole power station.

       While the peaking plant can be thought  of  as  a conventional steam
       turbine plant with an MHD generator attached in front, the base-load
       plant is more  like  an  MHD generator system with  a  steam  system
       tacked on behind.   The  base-load plant is the heart of a utility's
       electrical system, the kind of plant  that  generates  most  of  the
       system's power throughout the day and night.  A base-load  MHD plant
       would begin with  an  MHD generator.  But since the exhaust from the
       MHD channel is still so hot and energetic, this exhaust will be used
       to make steam and generate still more  electricity with conventional
       turbine equipment.  The differences between the base-load  plant and
       peaking plant are  mainly  those  of  size  and aim.  In the peaking
       plant, the MHD generator will probably  be small and used only for a
       few hours per  month.   In  the base-load plant, the  MHD  generator
       (though still small  in  physical  dimensions) will produce at least
       half of the total plant's power output  (500  MW  or more).  And the
       base load MHD  generator  will be designed to run for  thousands  of
       hours, continuously.

       The best base-load  plants of today, the fossil-fueled steam plants,
       are slightly better than 40% efficient.   The earliest MHD base-load
       plant will be  between  50%  and  60% efficient.   While  we'll  see
       shortly that this  has important implications for pollution control,
       this increased efficiency of MHD  also  is  vitally important to the
       economics of power generation.  Cost studies of MHD power plants

                                      Page 13





       have shown that   they'll   be   more   economical   to  build  than
       conventional or nuclear power stations.  And the cost of electricity
       produced by MHD will be lower, a  fact  that  should  make  both the
       utility owners and the bill-paying consumers smile with pleasure.

       There's a third type of MHD system that might find  possible  use in
       the utilities' power grids; the emergency MHD generator.

       The base-load plant  is  designed to operate for thousands of hours;
       the peaking plant will operate for a few hundred hours per year.  An
       emergency MHD plant might operate  for  as little as a few hours, or
       even minutes, per year.  But when it's needed it MUST perform.

       The electric utilities  are  required  by  law  to  have  a  certain
       percentage of their total power generation capacity HELD IN RESERVE.
       Each utility grid  has  several power stations that stand by - ready
       to come on the line with power if  an  emergency situation develops.
       The aim of this, of course, is to avert shortages or  blackouts.  Of
       the reserve plants,  some  must be kept as "spinning reserve."  That
       is, the boilers  are  hot,  the  turbines   are  spinning,  and  the
       generators have been  hit so quickly that even the spinning  reserve
       wasn't on-line fast enough to prevent a black-out.

       Moreover, as the increasing frequency of blackouts and brownouts has
       shown recently, the   utilities'   reserves   are   being  stretched
       perilously thin.  The demand for  electrical  power  is growing much
       faster than new power stations can be built.

       An emergency MHD generator could help to clear up the problem.

       An MHD generator like the LORHO machine could sit totally  shut down
       for months, then come on the line with its full power in a minute or
       less.  Turning on  an  MHD  generator is very much like turning on a
       rocket engine; within the time it takes the plasma to go through the
       channel, the MDH generator is putting out full power.  The generator
       can remain idle,  costing practically  nothing  until  it's  needed.
       Then it can come on the line with tens or hundreds of megawatts.

       The difference between  an emergency generator and  a  peaking  unit
       isn't hard and  fast.  The economics of power generation may show it
       will be better for the utilities to build peaking MHD generators and
       have them available as emergency units when needed.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       POLLUTION AND NATURAL RESOURCES

       The MHD generator's advantages in pollution control, in conservation
       of natural resources, and in ecology  can  be  summed up in a single
       word: efficiency.

       Electric power stations  make  several kinds of pollution.   There's
       THERMAL POLLUTION of water.  Steam power plants take in water from a
       stream or lake,  use  it to make steam, and then discharge the water
       BACK INTO ITS SOURCE at a temperature higher than it was ORIGINALLY.
       Fish, plants, and - most important  -  scavenging bacteria are often
       killed by being   exposed  to  temperatures  higher   than   they're
       accustomed to.  In  severe  cases,  the  stream can be turned into a
       lifeless sewer.  Nuclear power stations  are even worse than fossil-
       fueled plants when it comes to thermal pollution of  water,  because
       they operate at  lower  efficiences,  and  thus  have  more  heat to
       reject.
                                      Page 14





       Then there's the   familiar   AIR  POLLUTION  of  the  fossil-fueled
       station's belching smokestacks.  The  nuclear plants are quite clean
       when it comes  to air pollution.  But the exhaust  products  of  the
       combustion that takes  place  in the fossil plants' burners foul our
       air with unsightly and unhealthy soot,  carbon  monoxide, and oxides
       of sulfur and nitrogen.

       The big, ugly dark clouds coming out of the stacks  are  an  obvious
       eyesore.  But the  invisible gaseous compounds such as the oxides of
       nitrogen are probably more dangerous,  harder  to identify, and much
       harder to get rid of.  The sulfur oxides can be controlled  to  some
       extent by using fuels that are low in sulfur content.

       There's a third type of pollution that's connected only with nuclear
       generators: radioactivity.  While  there's  been  much strong public
       reaction to the potential hazards from radioactivity, there seems to
       be much less danger of a nuclear reactor  exploding  or accidentally
       letting a harmful  amount  of radioactivity loose than  the  dangers
       from air and water pollution.

       Thermal pollution is  nothing  more  than  WASTE HEAT.  The higher a
       generator's efficiency, the more  of  the  energy  originally in its
       fuel will come  out  AS ELECTRICITY, and the less waste  heat  there
       will be.  While no machine is going to be 100% efficient (hah!), the
       MHD generator will  be  half-again  as  efficient as the best modern
       turbine systems.  This means less  waste  heat, per kilowatt-hour of
       electricity generated.

       Moreover, it will  be  possible to develop MHD power  stations  that
       require NO STEAM   CYCLE   at  all.   Instead  of  feeding  the  MHD
       generator's exhaust into  steam boilers  and  steam  turbines,  jet-
       engine type gas turbines can be built into the MHD  station instead.
       Without the necessity  for  steam, the power station can run without
       drawing any water whatsoever, except  the  slight amount needed as a
       coolant in various parts of the machinery.  But the  coolant  can be
       kept in a  "closed  loop"  and recycled continuously without drawing
       fresh water from outside the plant or rejecting heated water.

       An MHD-gas turbine station would still  generate  waste heat, and in
       fact may be slightly less efficient than an MHD-steam  system.   But
       the waste heat  from  a  gas-turbine  cycle would be rejected to the
       atmosphere, not to a natural water  source.   In  many  parts of the
       United States, where water is scarce and can't be used  as a dumping
       pool for waste  heat, the MHD-gas turbine station offers perhaps the
       only way of developing large power stations.  And the heat that's to
       be rejected to the atmosphere might  be  used  in  other  ways, too.
       There's still some  energy  in  that exhaust gas; some  enterprising
       engineer will probably  come  up  with  a scheme for turning it into
       useful work.

       The same efficiency  that keeps thermal  pollution  low  in  an  MHD
       generator will also tend to help reduce air pollution.   If  you get
       more kilowatts per  pound  of fuel, you can use less fuel to get the
       power you want, and thus produce less air pollution.

       But the exhaust of an MHD generator  is loaded with pollutants, just
       the same.  In fact, it's so bad that it's good!  There's more of the
       oxides of nitrogen  and  sulfur  in  an  MHD  exhaust   than   in  a
       conventional generator's smokestack (assuming that the MHD station

                                      Page 15





       is burning low  grade,  sulfur-rich  fuels).   And  the  MHD exhaust
       contains an extra pollutant that conventional  machines  don't have;
       the potassium "seed" material that was injected into  the  burner to
       enhance the plasma's conductivity.

       The seed material and the high temperature of the exhaust plasma are
       the two keys to controlling MHD generator's air pollution.

       First, the potassium  seed  is  valuable.   To make MHD economically
       atttractive as possible, it's necessary  to  recover the seed rather
       than let it escape out of the stack.  So, built into the MHD station
       is an efficient  particle  separator  that  will   shake   all   the
       particulate material out  of  the exhaust gases.  The potassium will
       be recovered and recycled.  All  the  soot  and  fly-ash  and  other
       pollution particles will  be trapped before they get  into  the  air
       outside the station.

       Removal of the  oxides of nitrogen and sulfur is a bit trickier, but
       much more elegant.

       As the plasma comes out of the MHD  generator  channel  it is loaded
       with these oxides.  But the temperature of the MHD  exhaust  is very
       high, high enough  to  allow  some interesting chemical reactions to
       take place.  If  the exhaust gases  are  put  through  an  expanding
       nozzle, like a rocket nozzle, the gases will quickly  cool  down  to
       the point where  the  nitrogen and sulfur oxides can be removed from
       the gas stream   by  well-known  chemical   separation   techniques.
       Experiments have shown  that  this  can  be done,  while  still  not
       cooling the exhaust so much that it becomes useless for steam or gas
       turbines.  And the  nitrogen  and  sulfur oxides so recovered can be
       sold for fertilizer production!

       So recovering the potassium seed and nitrogen and sulfur oxides both
       helps the economics of the MHD station  and leads to a final exhaust
       gas that contains   little   more  than  harmless  carbon   dioxide,
       molecular nitrogen, and water vapor.

       In this discussion  of  MHD  and  pollution,  we've assumed that MHD
       power stations will use CONVENTIONAL furnaces and burn fossil fuels.
       As we'll see  shortly,  the  possibility  of  practical  nuclear-MHD
       stations isn't out  of the question, but certainly  appears  further
       downstream than fossil-fueled MHD generators.

       The MHD generators  will be able to burn fuels that can't be used in
       steam turbine plants.  In essence,  the MHD system will help to save
       our existing supply  of  coal,  oil and natural gas,  bu  using  low
       grades of coal and oil that are currently considered unfit for use.

       There are several reasons for this.  First, the MHD generator system
       can trap the  sulfur  oxides in its exhaust and even make commercial
       use out of them.  This means that  MHD stations can burn high-sulfur
       coal without causing increased air pollution.  Steam  turbine plants
       can't do this, and right now many of this nation's coal reserves are
       lying idle and unused.

       Also, the MHD  generator  can  handle highly corrosive fuels without
       trouble, which turbines  can't do.   Again,  this  means  that  fuel
       reserves now being  ignored  can  be  utilized  to   produce  useful
       electrical power.  It could also mean new jobs and new dignity for

                                      Page 16





       the people of the depressed coal-mining regions of our nation.

       And the possibilities  of building MHD-gas turbine systems that need
       little or no water can have ENORMOUS  implications  for  the Western
       regions of the United States, and all other water-poor  areas of the
       world.

       In many western states there are huge deposits of low-grade coal and
       virtually no water  available  for industrial use.  MHD power plants
       can use that coal and don't need water.   Cheap, abundant electrical
       power could attract new industry to regions that are  now depressed.
       New towns and  cities  could  be  built,  perhaps, based on RATIONAL
       PLANNING and NEW  TECHNOLOGY.    The   flow   of   people  from  the
       countryside into our already overcrowded and decaying  older  cities
       might be checked IN THIS WAY.

       A fanciful dream, maybe.  But it's fascinating to think that softly-
       glowing plasma in  Crooke's  discharge  tubes of a century ago might
       have such IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS for the nation and the world before
       this century is finished.

       POSTSCRIPT ON SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNETS

       You recall that when we discussed  the  AVCO Mark V self-excited MHD
       generator, we pointed out that 10 MW of the generator's  power  went
       into feeding the  copper  magnet.  From an economic point of view, a
       power generator would be much better  off  if its magnet didn't need
       any electricity.  There are natural magnets, such as lodestones, but
       they're much too low in field strength to be used in  any  practical
       large-sized power generators.

       In 1960, researchers  at  the  Bell Telephone Laboratories announced
       the discovery of something that seemed  miraculous; a combination of
       materials that produced a magnet capable of nearly 100,000 gauss YET
       DIDN'T NEED ANY ELECTRICAL POWER INPUT once it was  energized.  This
       was the first high-field-strength SUPERCONDUCTING magnet.

       Superconductivity had been known since 1911.  Certain materials such
       as MERCURY lose  all  electrical resistance when they're cooled down
       to a temperature near absolute zero.   Such  temperatures are called
       CRYOGENIC, from the  Greek  KRYOS,  which  means  "icy  cold."   The
       superconductors discovered in  1911  were  capable  of  only  rather
       modest magnetic field strengths, and  were useful only as scientific
       curiosities.

       But the superconducting  materials  discovered  in  the  1960's  are
       capable of sustaining  fields  of  30,000 to 400,000 gauss!  (modern
       strengths are in the millions)  These materials are all compounds or
       alloys of metals such as niobium,  zirconium,  tin,  titanium, and a
       few others.

       When an electrical current is put into a superconductor, the current
       REMAINS CIRCULATING through  the  material  continuously,   with  NO
       MEASURABLE RESISTANCE.  So  you  can  charge  up  a  superconducting
       magnet and then disconnect the electrical  power.   The  magnet will
       remain energized INDEFINITELY, as long as it stays superconducting.

       To remain superconducting, the material must be kept  at a cryogenic
       temperature.  Usually liquid helium is used to refrigerate

                                      Page 17





       superconductors.  Helium liquefies  at  4.2  degrees  Kelvin.   Most
       superconductors lose their     superconducting     properties     at
       temperatures of between 10 degrees Kelvin and 20 degrees Kelvin.

       Like all new discoveries, there were a number of practical  problems
       associated with superconductors.    But  most  of  these  have  been
       solved, and large, reliable superconducting  magnets are being built
       today even though   the   exact   details   of   the    physics   of
       superconductivity aren't yet clearly understood.

       For the MHD   generator,  superconducting  magnets  are  a  godsend.
       First, they NEED NO POWER.  Second,  they  produce much higher field
       strengths than room-temperature electro-magnets, and  MHD generators
       can capitalize on   high   field  strength  more  than  conventional
       generators can.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Vangard Note...

           An associated  development   that   might   prove   useful   for
           experimenting with  MHD  generator systems is  the  Super  Steam
           Technology.  SST  can generate temperatures up to 6000 degrees F
           which is well within that required  to  heat the plasma.  We are
           not aware  at this time if such a hybrid system  has  ever  been
           attempted but it might work out.

           Bob Paddock   informs   us   that  an  older  edition  of  Radio
           Electronics or one of the popular  electronics type of magazines
           had a detailed article on MHD that showed home experimenters HOW
           TO BUILD THEIR OWN!!!  We would greatly appreciate  this info as
           it would  be  very useful to many folks wishing to experiment in
           this area.

           The combination of superconducting  magnets and the SST with MHD
           designs might  yet yield something everyone could  use.   It  is
           puzzling why  so  many  people don't choose to GET OFF THE POWER
           GRID and work to develop STANDALONE power generation systems for
           EACH AND EVERY HOME.  The manufacture,  sale  and maintenance of
           these units would provide a major boost to business  despite the
           eventual demise of centralized power systems.

           Most of  us  here on KeelyNet foresee the INEVITABLE development
           and USE of such STANDALONE power devices for not only home power
           but also  automobiles and other  modes  of  transportation.   We
           continue to work to effect such breakthroughs.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Additional information from Joel

       Hydrogen under enough pressure, such as at the center  of  the  sun,
       becomes helium, which  is  a  noble  gas.   This is the beginning of
       nuclear fusion.  For this to happen,  the pressure has to exceed the
       "Coulomb Barrier", ie,  great enough to force the protons  together,
       despite their natural  tendency  to  repel.   There isn't a force on
       earth that will do that, so we use heat instead of pressure, ala the
       H-boomer, to do the same thing.

       If the fusion  reaction  were to self-sustain,  there  would  be  an
       evacuation of all of the hydrogen on this planet, and there would be
       only dust left.  There was fear that this would happen before we set

                                      Page 18





       off the first one, and a fusion reaction did occur, but it (luckily)
       extinguished before gaining enough momentum to self-sustain.  That's
       why we test underground, now, not because of any special concern for
       the long-term health effects of it.

       The point of  this  is that without the plasma effect, ie the helium
       to conduct electrons, there would  be no stars, planets, or anything
       else except hydrogen clouds.  Heavy waters, such  as  deuterium  and
       tritium, are used  to  create  cold  fusion,  and  even  though  the
       electrical output is miniscule and  short  lived,  it shows that the
       plasma effect does not depend solely upon heat and pressure, but can
       be chemically created.  If it can become self-sustaining, then there
       exist a low power but premanent battery.  However there  are  better
       and easier ways to use the plasma effect for this purpose.

       Pumping out a  tube will enable you to build a "glow tube", in which
       the trace amounts of noble gases will  form clouds, conduct and emit
       light.  However, the weak emissions are not useful  for either light
       or energy.  Using  a  tube  which  has  already been pumped and then
       filled with noble  gases will do much  better.   Some  experimenters
       report that using  a high DC voltage will push the electrons  aside,
       and permit access  to  the  protons.   A magnetic mirror will do the
       same thing, and it is simply an electromagnet  which runs the length
       of the tube.

       Because it creates N-S polarization, the electrons accumulate on the
       plus side, where they can be tapped off.  Also, the  magnetic mirror
       will force the gases away from the tube wall, thus keeping them from
       cooling, which yields even higher gain.

       In vacuum tubes,  such  as the mercury vapor, small amounts of solid
       mercury are introduced to allow a controlled arc to occur across the
       electrodes.  This arc is useful in high energy applications, such as
       rectifiers, when you need high current  output.   The  energy across
       the plate/cathode causes the mercury to vaporize, which  is  why you
       get a flash when you first plug one in.

       In other tubes,  gases form with aging, and when they arc, you throw
       away the tube.  Arcing is wasteful, as it is a controlled breakdown,
       and does not create the environment needed for above-unity.

       Although a neon tube remains cool  to the touch, the temperatures of
       the subatomic particles  are  extreme.   That is  one  of  the  most
       interesting things about  the  plasma  effect,  in  that  there  are
       extremely high temperatures but VIRTUALLY NO HEAT!

       The same thing  occurs  in the sun's  corona.   The  temperature  is
       millions of degrees, but you could freeze to death  in  it.  Because
       of this, and the conductivity of the noble gases, it is relatively
       easy to tap enormous amounts of ZPE by either electrifying the gases
       or by spontaneous chemical reaction, ala cold fusion.

       Pressurizing noble gases, and forcing them through a magnetic field,
       will also create  electric current, which was how the Mark V worked,
       thirty years ago.  Nixon nixed  the  idea  of  using  this  type  of
       generator to resolve energy problems.  Free and non-polluting energy
       does not serve the interests of anyone except the people, and we had
       no say in the decision.

       Find yourself a  copy  of the book that I mentioned, and get several
       copies if you can...it sold for $1.95 new, twenty years ago.

       All of the   answers  are  there,   including   how   to   build   a
       Biefield/Brown that ACTUALLY WORKS!

       It seems that  Brown  didn't  mention the electromagnet  inside  the
       discs, which was  used  TO  PUSH  ELECTRONS  AWAY  from  the charged
       surfaces (as was done in Searls flying  disc).   In other words, you
       charge the plates  to 200MV, and the EM field will  keep  the  field
       from arcing or  dissipating,  so once you apply the charge, you shut
       down the power generator!  Cool, huh?
