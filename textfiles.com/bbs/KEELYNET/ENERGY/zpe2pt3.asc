                          PART III OF REVIEW AND OUTLOOK

       Michelson, Dirac, de  Broglie  were not the only Nobel prize winners
       in favor of  a reexamination of the  ether  question.   Others  were
       Stark, Arrhenius, A.H.  Compton,  Lenard,  H. Yukawa,  and  Fredrick
       Soddy, the British  scientist  who,  during  the convention of Nobel
       laureates in Lindau, 1954, described  the  current dogmas in physics
       as "an orgy  of  amateur  physics"  and "arrogant  swindle"  -  with
       particular emphasis on the theory of relativity.

       It remained largely  unknown,  even  to  physicists,  that  Einstien
       himself had serious doubts.  In 1949,  he  wrote  to his old friend,
       Maurice Solovine, who congratulated him on his 70th birthday:

            "Now you think that I am looking back at my  life's  work  with
             calm satisfaction.    But,   on   closer  look,  it  is  quite
             different.  There is not  a  single  concept  of  which  I  am
             convinced that it will stand firm and I am not  sure  if I was
             on the right track after all".

       And one of  my  Canadian  friends  I  believe  is present here today
       stated quite correctly in a letter to me:

            "The myths around Einstien are really not of his making as he
            himself often questioned his own conclusions and I felt he was
            quite aware of his own limitations  which  others were covering
            up.  The Physicists protect their members much the same way
            that the medical profession protects its own".

       The purpose of  these  remarks  is not to spark another  controversy
       about the merits  of  the theories of relativity.  Rather, they want
       to show that so-called "scientific  evidence"  is  a  rather elastic
       term and that  "verification" is always a relative  affair.   Or  as
       K.R. Popper so  aptly put it:  "Only in our subjective experience of
       conviction, in our  subjective   faith,   can   we   be  `absolutely
       certain`".

       This symposium presents  an  excellent  overview   of  research  and
       experiments reported from English speaking countries, or experiments
       published in the  English language, as for instance Japan.  However,
       as Dr. Tenhaeff from Holland has formulated the problem:

            "It is important to pay attention to publications of colleagues

                                      Page 1





            in other countries.  In the Netherlands and Germany, every
            academically educated man or woman know at least three foreign
            languages.  English and American authors only pay attention to
            material in   English.    In  my  opinion,  this  leads  to  an
            `impoverishment' which puts a  drag in science.  Some seem very
            chauvinistic and seem to believe that only the  researches done
            in their  country  are  important.   I regret this.  Science is
            international, and international cooperation is of the greatest
            importance in science".

       In presenting some brief reports  from  abroad,  I  shall attempt to
       bring corroborative evidence  in  support of alternative  technology
       developments discussed during  our  meeting here in Toronto.  Let me
       start with the most sensitive and secretive society, with Russia.

       In his German original of the paper  "Some  Remarks on the Shielding
       Theory of Gravity",  which was published in the Hanover  Proceedings
       in more detail  than the English abstract, Dr. Hans Nieper mentioned
       the Berlin engineer Levetzow, who  was one of the first to postulate
       a combination pressure  and  shielding theory for the  phenomena  of
       gravity.

       Levetzow was soon   overshadowed   by  the  rising  star  of  Albert
       Einstein, but one of his followers, Horst Pinkell, went to Russia in
       1928 as an exchange student - and  never  returned.   Together  with
       Russian scientists, he  was asked to prove the actual  existence  of
       the cosmic radiations  postulated  by  Levetzow,  now  designated as
       neutrino sea or "tachion field".

       The work was done in Sterlitamak,  south  of the Ural mountains, and
       in 1938, sporadic reports reached the West about  the  discovery  of
       extremely short corpuscler  waves by Pinkell and Gorjew.  These were
       the long sought "Hemmstrahlen" or drag waves associated gravity.

       Rumors have it that a metal alloy  was soon developed which acted as
       a drag wave  polarisor  and,  in 1947, agents reported  experimental
       Russian aircraft using this discovery.

       In 1951, a  former  German  Junkers aircraft engineer reported about
       his activity pertaining to a super-secret  project  code named COW-7
       in Siberia, a  disk-shaped  craft  which could rise  vertically  and
       which belonged to the secret weapons then developed by the Soviets.

       Whether it was  related  to  the  Canadian AVRO project or something
       entirely different remained  unknown,   only  the  Levetzow  gravity
       theory was assumed in connection with the activity in question.

       JAPAN:  My esteemed friend, Prof. Seike, who kept me  informed about
       the research conducted  by him and his co-workers, surprised me once
       with a significant statement, which  I  feel  is important to repeat
       for the benefit  of  frustrated  researcher's on this  side  of  the
       Pacific: "In the  early  stage  of  my studies, physicists could not
       understand what I was doing, while  actors  and  actresses did so by
       intuition".  it was  the  private  support of about  800  individual
       artists, etc., in  Japan  which  allowed the support of the Japanese
       equivalent of a   National   Science   Foundation   or   a   similar
       bureaucratic institution in that country.

       Again and again, I was surprised how quickly and eagerly American

                                      Page 2





       experiments, as for instance the almost forgotten "Ionocraft" of the
       late Major De   Seversky,  were  duplicated  and  explored  even  in
       Japanese secondary schools.  Admiral  Rickover  has  more  than once
       complained about our intellectual complacency: "As a nation, we seem
       addicted to 'spectatoritis'.  We sit in the bleachers  and  let  the
       game of life unfold before us".

       The results are  known:  The Japanese have achieved top positions in
       science and technology, and not  only  with  tachion  beams  melting
       stones, producing "biased" water with a freezing  point  of  minus 4
       degrees Celsius, and  a  G- power generator obtaining 400 VDC output
       from a 10 V input driving source.   I  wish to take this opportunity
       to thank Prof. Seike for sharing his work with us in  this  country,
       and wish him the best of success for the future.

       FRANCE:  The work  of SEPED was explained by M. Rene Louis Valee and
       some French publications in the area  of  gravity research have been
       translated by the  NASA  translation services, as for  instance  the
       theory of the electromagnetic Magnus Effect (of Marcel Pages).

       Specific mention must   be  made  of  the  Raymond  Kromrey  G-Field
       generator, a French-Ferman-Swiss   development  which  appears  very
       closely related to   the   American   "N"  machine  principle,   the
       "Sunburst" machine and the "Permanent Magnet-Motor" Patent of Howard
       Johnson.  Utilizing either permanent or electromagnetic modules, the
       generator output exceeds the input by far.

       One prototype delivers  approximately  700  watts  at speeds varying
       between 600 and 1200 RPM.  Models  with  an  output of 100 to 160 KW
       are presently in the planning stage.  Several European  patents have
       been granted against   heavy   opposition,  especially  from  French
       industrial circles.  The development  was  about  40  years  in  the
       making and the  inventor stresses the need for a reinvestigation  of
       electromagnetics and gravitic  forces, as well as a reexamination of
       many cemented dogmas in present day physics.

       GERMANY:  A system of rotating electromagnets  and  magnetic "stator
       rings" of the German "Kunel" Generator complement the  general trend
       of the American  and  French generators mentioned before.  The first
       prototype was reported to have been  tested  in  April,  1980.  Here
       again, very heavy  opposition  from  the  German  orthodox   science
       establishment.  Of special  interest  is a comment by Nobel laureate
       Werner Heisenberg, reported  to   have   been   made  vis-a-vis  the
       inventor:

            "I think it is possible to utilize magnetism as an energy
            source.  But we science idiots cannot do that; this has to
            come from the outside".

       More details about   French  and  German  developments   have   been
       published in the  new book already mentioned, Energy in Abundance by
       Hilscher and, hopefully, an English  version  of this important work
       will be available by next year.  Generators which do  interact  with
       surrounding energy fields have been designated as "open systems", in
       contrast to our  present  "closed system" technology of gasoline and
       diesel engines, steam turbines, nuclear power plants and so forth.

       The theoretical basis for all "open systems" is the realization that
       there simply is no such thing as "empty space".  In reality, space

                                      Page 3





       is filled with  an  extremely  energy rich, subatomic and subquantic
       continuum.  In short, a pre-physical  state  of matter, which can be
       tapped, as for instance by the spinning of magnetic systems which
       extract momentum via  a  vortex-formation of the universal  "tachion
       field".

       AUSTRIA:  This small  heartland  of  Central  Europe is proud of her
       native pioneers in science, among  them  Dr.  Wilhelm  Reich, Viktor
       Schauberger and Karl Schappeller.  But after Dr. Reiche  died  in an
       American prison in  1957  and victor Schauberger died only five days
       after his return  from  the  USA  in  1958,  where  he  received  an
       incredibly unfair treatment  from certain industrialists,  there  is
       little enthusiasm among  Austrians to touch base with correspondents
       on this continent.  Viktor Schauberger's  son, Walter, refuses, as a
       matter of principle,  to communicate with Americans,  no  matter  in
       what language.  To   illustrate   the   type  of  "contract"  Viktor
       Schauberger was forced to sign, it stated:

            that all  of  his patents would  become  the  property  of  the
            "consortium"' that any future inventions or developments  would
            also become  the  property  of  the  consortium., that he would
            refrain from discussing any of  it  with third parties, that he
            would refrain from publishing, that all plans  and models would
            remain with the consortium after his departure from America>

       There is a  favorite  saying  in  that small country which is to the
       point:

           "After the  Greek  philosopher  Pythagoras  had  discovered  his
            famous theorem, he sacrificed a whole hectatomb  of  oxen  as a
            thanksgiving to  the  Gods.   Ever  since,  all the oxen in the
            world are  running  scared   whenever  a  new  truth  has  been
            discovered".

       Knowledge of the ideas of Schauberger and Schauppeller appears to be
       essential for an  understanding  of  our  changing  picture  of  the
       physical world.  As  an  example,  the  former  forest ranger Viktor
       Schauberger had watched  numerous   times   some   trout   standing,
       apparently motionless, in  the  strong currents of  Alpine  mountain
       streams.  This and  many  similar observations of nature brought him
       to the gradual development of his  "Implosion-theory" and associated
       hardware (see Jensen Paper).  His son is continuing  the work in the
       "Pythagoras-Kepler" school in Bad Ischl.

       Another prolific researcher  is  the  Viennese engineer Franz Seidl,
       known for his  studies  of the use  of  magnetic  field  effects  as
       "trigger energy" for voltage and power multipliers.

       HOLLAND:   A small country with a strongly developed intellectual
       independence appears to   be  Holland,  where  Prof.   J.M.J.   Kooy
       developed his space dynamics.  His hypothesis of gravitaional action
       is based on  the  realization  that  all  celestial  bodies  can  be
       conceived as practically transparent  in relation to the size of the
       elementary particles and their mutual distances in  the structure of
       matter.  Gravitons or  tachions,  coming from all directions of deep
       space, can pass through a celestial body like water passes through a
       fishnet, and only  a minute fraction  of  the  cosmic  gravitons  or
       tachions will be intercepted.  Study of the effects  of  the tachion
       fields or space continuum of the fabric of material substances,

                                      Page 4





       magnets and crystal  lattices  can lead to development of converters
       and novel production facilities for readily usable, conventional E/M
       energy.

       When the American inventor Edwin V.  Gray was blocked in his efforts
       to develop his  "pulsed  capacitor  discharge electric  engine"  for
       which he had received U.S. Patent #3,890,548, he found open ears and
       open minds in Holland.

       The fact that  Gray  was  named  "Inventor  of  the  Year"  from the
       department of Patent Rights in Los  Angeles,  California,  where Dr.
       Chalfin of Cal-Tech confirmed that:

            There does not exist an even distantly similar  engine  to this
            one in  the world.  Conventional electric engines use up power.
            In this system energy is used up for only a minute part of a
            millisecond.  It operates without heat loss and there is no
            energy loss whatsoever with this system",

       had more meaning to the PHILLIPS  and  others  in  Holland  than  to
       energy establishments in his native America.

       ENGLAND:  There is perhaps no more controversial  inventor  at  this
       time than John R. R. Searl and his Levity Disc, powered by the Searl
       Effect Generator.  It   is   claimed  that  model  craft  have  been
       demonstrated with flight characteristics  showing anti-gravitational
       and inertia-free properties.  Demonstrations have been  photographed
       and videotaped.  Searl  calls  his  generator  a "Gyro-Flywheel High
       Energy Density Mechanical Device"  and  claims that the magnets used
       are not the common type, ordinary magnets.

       The Australian engineer Athol Park of Melbourne, who visited Searl a
       few years ago described it this way:

            "From a briefcase, Mr. Searl takes a bar magnet and two steel
            rollers.  He places the rollers at either end of the magnet.
            They appear to be attracted to the poles - but, when they are
            pushed gently around the corners of the magnet, they chase each
            other round and round...."

       The engineer quotes Searl:

            "The crystal in the magnet are changed by putting it in a
            magnetic flux oven and by frequency control.  The result is
            motion of a magnetic field - a completely new source of power.
            Unis (modules) based on this principle are what power my
            levity unit - the motor and generator built as one, fuelless
            unit".

       In one of his numerous newsletters he states further:

            "The power plant is a self-contained, onboard closed system of
             conversion elements with energy input from  a  latent  storage
             source".

       Because Searl has  never  divulged  all details and his explanations
       are generally of  a  non-technical,   "unscientific"   nature,  many
       investigators have chosen to dismiss him as a swindler and imposter.
       In sharp contrast to this is the opinion of a well-experienced

                                      Page 5





       American engineer who reported after a visit with Searl:

            "I found it resfreshing to note the keen sense of moral respon-
            sibility which he feels for the use to which his discovery is
            put...  The  Searls live in modest circumstances.  Luxuries are
            few.  They do not own a car.  Mr. Searl bicycles several miles
            daily to his place of work  in  Maidenhead.   There  he  is  an
            electrical technician  and  training supervisor  in  a  bearing
            factory".

       But perhaps most  significant  was  the following observation of the
       American visitor about Searl:

            "We were also interested to hear him say that many of his ideas
            came to  him  while  he slept.   He  would  go  to  sleep  with
            question, and wake with answers... and refreshed.  He seemed to
            have the ability to restore vital powers more quickly than most
            people".

       And the American concluded his report with the statement:

            "The impression  we  gained  of Mr. Searl was  one  of  a  very
             sincere and  generous  person, a dedicated and tireless worker
             with perfect confidence in the  outcome  of his efforts, a man
             of high principle with a keen sense of loyalty  to  those  who
             are helping  him, and of responsibility for the future welfare
             of our planet and its people".

       In view of the very contradictory nature of comments and impressions
       by those who have met Searl, it  might  be  wise  to  reverse  final
       judgement on the Searl-Levity-Disc and its inventor at this time.

       NEW ZEALAND:  Some of Searl's keenest supporters  and  observers  of
       his work are  in New Zealand and Australia.  And one of the sharpest
       young physicists in  that  country   (New  Zealand),  unhampered  by
       calcified ideology, developed  the  mathematical  foundation  for  a
       theoretical anti-gravity effect,  using  the hydrodynamic analogy of
       the ether.

       He uses the equivalent of the hydrodynamic  Reynolds number, above a
       certain value of which the laminar flow past a solid  surface breaks
       down and becomes  turbulent  due  to  shear  rupture  of the viscous
       cohesion of a fluid, together with  his  deduction that anti-gravity
       could be obtained by creating a "vacuum: in the ether  in such a way
       as to correspond to the production of turbulence in a magnetic
       field.

       Turbulence in a fluid occurs when Reynolds number RE = 1, when the
       inertial shearing force  equals  the  viscous  cohesion force in the
       fluid in the vicinity of an approximately spherical body immersed in
       the fluid, resulting  in  separation   of  the  boundary  layer  and
       formation of a wake i.e.  vacuum or free surface  around  the  body.
       He calculated the  for  turbulence  in  the  ether, = a vacuum = and
       anti-gravity effect, using  the refined  value  of  ether  kinematic
       viscosity which he obtained.

       His theory would  confirm  the  observations  of very  high  voltage
       produced in the  case  of  the Searl Disc, and the very high voltage
       needed in the vacuum experiments with flying disc-shaped bodies of

                                      Page 6





       T.T. Brown, the  ionocraft  observations  of  Major de Seversky, the
       Electro-Field Rockets of Prof. Dudley,  the observations of Northrup
       Corp. with Electro-Aerodynamics  in  Supersonic  Flow   and  similar
       American documentaion and patents.

       Since the New  Zealander  is  now  in  the  process of attempting to
       publish his theory in a reputable  British  magazine,  I  am  not at
       liberty to divulge his address prematurely.  Interest in New Zealand
       and Australia is running high, and possible breakthroughs  in energy
       technology should not come totally unexpected in these two countries
       with strong intellectual tiers to England.

       CONCLUSION:  There is  now  overwhelming  evidence  for  the  actual
       existence of a  very  high  density,  energy  rich  space  continuum
       formerly called "ether".   This  space  energy can be  concentrated,
       gathered, focused, magnified  and  compacted  by magnets of magnetic
       materials, which appear as the new  core  material for converters of
       all kinds, utilizing   the   cosmic   energy  for   new   technology
       applications.

       Crystals are energy-sensing  and  channeling devices; they can serve
       as transducers, as for instance in  the  Moray-Device,  or the "rock
       electricity" of T.T. Brown.

       Combinations of crystals  and  magnetic material appear  to  be  the
       mainstay for the  development  of  "hyper-space"  -  converters  and
       generators of power - utilizing free, cosmic energy in our future.

       Unbiased, totally honest    and    impartial    reexamination    and
       reevaluation of ALL  scientific  theorems  and dogmas,  as  well  as
       unhampered opportunities for  the  pioneers of the new technology on
       the American and European continent appear to be the prerequisite of
       success.

       Those who accept that anything of the nature of ideas or ideology is
       permanent, use all their strength  to hold on to it, and condemn all
       who do not agree.  The next stage of this spiritual  illness  of the
       mind is to build a monument to what they perceive is Truth, and then
       to build a  monument  to  their  own permanence in the world.  This,
       they do by seeking fame or fortune, and authority over others.  This
       is the contemporary, planetary psychology situation, and thus are we
       losing the gift of perspective and horizon and are no longer able to
       discern what is important.  Skeptics are on record as saying:

            "We are not running out of natural resources or intellectual
             talent, we are running out of  the  freedom of innovation that
             made the  countries on the North American continent  the  most
             advanced nations on Earth".

       The future will  show  whether  this  freedom,  which  includes  the
       freedom and the duty of taking risks,  can be restored to the degree
       our founding fathers have been striving for.  Only then will we know
       whether the late  Wernher  von  Braun was not too overly  optimistic
       when he stated:

            "The cosmic  age  will  bring  a  dawn  of  knowledge  not  yet
             envisioned.  IT WILL DWARF ALL OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE AND IDEAS
             and, through its vastness, may  even bring men closer together
             on their own planet".
