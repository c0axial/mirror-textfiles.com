                 Faraday experiment as related by Bruce de Palma

    Premise :  Spinning objects fall faster than non-spinning objects.

    "It began with a gyroscope, well, actually it began in  the  basement of
    the Royal Technical  Institute  of  London  where  Michael  Faraday,  in
    December of 1831, discovered two types of generators at the same time."

    "One became the basis of all the electric generators in the world today.
    The other was ignored because it couldn't be explained."

    Faraday was experimenting with copper wires and magnets.  He found if he
    held a magnet  in  one  hand and passed  a  wire  through  the  magnet's
    magnetic field, he could generate a small amount of electricity.

    Then he tried rotating a cylindrical magnet with a wire  attached to one
    of its poles and found that electricity was generated that way, too.

    Since no wire  was  passing  through  a  field, there was no resistance,
    which is why we must burn some kind  of  fuel to run today's generators.
    As long as the magnet turned, the energy flowed.

    "When I reevaluated  Faraday's  experiments, I theorized  that  rotating
    objects must attract   energy,   free   energy  that's  all  around  us.
    Therefore, rotating objects  should   fall   faster   than  non-rotating
    objects.

    We set up a measuring experiment that involved dropping  both gyroscopes
    and nonrotating objects,  and  the  gyroscopes DID fall faster, by about
    .05 percent."

    "The way to understand it is this:

         Everything in the universe is  made  of  male  and female energies.
         Energy is  being  renewed,  is  flowing into mass,  all  the  time.
         Rotation separates  male  from female.  The center remains still-no
         action, no motion, no force.  That is YIN.  That is FEMALE.

         The outer edge (of a rotating mass),  turns-action,  motion, force.
         This is MALE, or YANG.

    "Men and women  are  not opposites; we are at once both  yin  and  yang.
    Magnets polarize the   male   and   female  energies,  thereby  creating
    electricity.  This energy is everywhere.   It's  what makes the world go
    round and makes the planet circle the sun.  It's free.  Forever."

    The N Machine  ("N" in science, means "as many as possible"),  is  about
    the size of a toaster oven.  It consisted of a shaft with a cylindrical,
    eight inch magnet  on  one  end  and  an  ordinary electric motor on the
    other.  A wire  touched the outside  of  the  magnet  so  that  when  it
    rotated, current could be drawn back to the motor to keep  it  rotating.
    It was, indeed, self-running.

    This model produced  6.7  Horsepower  but  only took 1 Horsepower to run
    itself, so 5.7 Horsepower were left over to power washers and dryers and
    toasters.


    "What it means," says Bruce, "is the end of the Puritan work ethic.  Now
    we can have all the energy we want without having to work for it.

    Our minds can be liberated to develop  fully, to free human potential at
    no human expense and without polluting the earth.

    Nikola Tesla, the patron saint of electricity, once said:  'Someday  man
    will hook his  machines  to the very wheelwork of the universe.'  Now we
    can."

    "You know, with the right kind of support, I could have this thing ready
    for the public in six months.  But people  are  afraid of it, especially
    the money people.

    They know that it threatens the power structure of the  world,  that  it
    makes the idea of slaves and masters obsolete because

    it means that  every  single  person  already  owns all the power of the
    universe.  The machine is just the converter."
