           The following  file  is  a  composite all referenced to the file
           TESLAFE.ZIP on KeelyNet.  What  follows  are the related message
           threads that hint of a future release of information  should our
           contact succeed  in acquiring the information and translating it
           to English.

           The Tesla Free Energy Convertor  is  a quite intriguing piece of
           history that seems to have operated from an energy  source  most
           closely identified   as   ZPE  or  some  kind  of  "hyperspatial
           gateway".  The device either collected  extant electrical energy
           or actually pulled it from the hyperspace region as in the SWEET
           or ADAMS machines.  We will all have a better understanding when
           someone successfully duplicates any of these devices.

       Hi Mark!  I will be here this weekend and have been  "catching"  the
       phone before the  answering  machine takes over...some fellow called
       up from Indiana or somewhere like  that  saying  he had emigrated to
       the US from  Germany around 192...he says he has a  fairly  detailed
       article on the TESLA mystery power box as detailed in TESLAFE.ZIP...
       claims there were  only three tubes and they were all BEAM RECTIFIER
       TYPES, hell he  even  gave us the tube  numbers...(70L7GT)...anyway,
       seems this character has tons of info and is willing  to translate a
       very rare German  book  with  some  chapters that everyone here will
       find of interest, so guess I will call him this weekend...

       Re the beam  rectifier  tubes  reportedly  used  in  Tesla's  box  -
       rectification implies the  reception  of an AC signal,  which  might
       imply that Tesla had another "toy" nearby broadcasting power, albeit
       on a smaller  scale  than some of his earlier projects.  (We believe
       this to indicate a smaller Wardenclyffe  but there is no evidence of
       this....)

       Yes, and I  just  got another long distance correlation to that beam
       rectifier tube, seems  it used a  MERCURY  DIODE  (can  we  say  ion
       acoustic modulation)...a close friend said his brother was attending
       a graduation party for his class (electronics) and  was invited to a
       professors house...he was  shown a golf cart that contained only one
       battery and a mercury diode beam rectifier  tube...it  was in fact a
       free energy charging circuit to which the professor  would  give  no
       information...anyway, trying to  call the German fellow today to get
       some more info and see what we can "swap out"..
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       In case you have taken the file TESLAFE  describing  the free energy
       device that Tesla   constructed  and  tested  in  a   Pierce   Arrow
       automobile in the   early   30's,  we  have  been  given  additional
       information from a nice fellow in  California.   He emigrated to the
       States from Germany in 192 and has been following  the  free  energy
       field for many  years.   He  says  there  is a book or document that
       gives QUITE A FEW DETAILS on the Tesla  Free Energy Converter and if
       he can persuade his German source to share it, he will  send  it our
       way for distribution to the various nets and researchers...

       This fellow is definitely one of us and is HEAVY into the sharing of
       information with the  express  purpose  of building working machines
       that EVERYONE can use.

       Our new friend says that the Tesla F/E Converter used 3 vacuum tubes
       of the designation 70L7GT...this particular tube is listed as a BEAM
       POWER TUBE, also called a BEAM RECTIFIER TUBE.

       One of our other contacts suggested  that  this  might  be a mercury
       tube which would produce the ION ACOUSTIC modulations in the mercury
       vapor that Moray  King mentions in "Tapping the Zero  Point  Energy"
       and which T.  Henry  Moray  says  is  necessary  for  the successful
       tapping of the vacuum energy.

       On speaking with our California source this Sunday, he says his book
       on tubes does  not show this to  be  a  mercury  tube  although  the
       possibility was at first fascinating.

       One further comment  made (by our California friend)  was  that  the
       mysterious power reduction as mentioned in the filed ROSEN1 with the
       Sweet VTA might be due to a polarization current directly associated
       with the Earth's  magnetic  fields.  He suggests that anyone working
       with such a  device (a Sweet VTA  -  Vacuum  Tube  Amplifier)  might
       orient the machine so that the NORTH pole was DOWN,  or  facing EAST
       or facing WEST...these  are possibilities and speculatively based on
       the various magnetic field patterns  of  the  earth.   Personally  I
       think it has  something to do with pressure or potential  reductions
       in the ambient Aether for a given area...

       Despite the Michelson-Morley  findings  claiming  there is NO AETHER
       because they could  not  detect  any   aberrations,  (they  fail  to
       prominently mention the  12  mile  variation  from   experiment   to
       experiment which would  lead  one  to  believe  in  Aether potential
       changes as a result of entrainment by the Earth)...

       Anyway, thought this info might prove of use to all of us working on
       the duplication and improvement of such free energy devices.  Should
       our California friend  succeed in acquiring the details of the Tesla
       F/E device and translating them to English, we will have them online
       TOOTSWEET (a pun???)....hang in there,  we  get  closer  everyday as
       long as everyone shares....>>>  Jerry

       Per your earlier post on the Tesla F/E box and the  70L7GT  tubes it
       (supposedly) used.  To be honest, I have my doubts as the tube seems
       almost a toy...
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       from another message -

       I have not seen the specs or anything beyond what the fellow told us
       on the phone...guess  we will have to wait for what he gets from his
       German contact...you know, it does  not  take  POWER to get the free
       energy or anti-grav effects, simply a BIASING signal  that serves to
       "influence" or "re-direct"  the  flow....kind  of  like  the passive
       effect of the mirrored reflectors  in  a laser...they do nothing but
       reflect until the  intensity of the beam overcomes their  reflective
       ability, at which the now very powerful beam escapes...we shall see.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Jerry:

       Per your post about the Tesla F/E device...

       The following data  is  copied  verbatim from the 1964 RCA Receiving
       Tube Manual.  The 70L7GT is listed  as  a  discontinued  type so the
       wonderful descriptions of other tubes in the manual  is  unavailable
       for this type,  however a table of discontinued types at the back of
       the manual provided  the following.   The  diagram  is,  of  course,
       irreproducible in ASCII  but  it  looks like a very  ordinary  keyed
       octal glass tube  of  its  period,  at 1-3/16" diameter, 2-7/8" high
       (above chassis).  It does not possess  a metal "tit" at the top.  It
       appears that it's a dedicated-application tube for  radio  receivers
       (it both rectifies  and  amplifies;  cutting  down on tube count and
       saving manufacturing dollars) so  I  am  immediately skeptical about
       any real significance  to  this  type.   There  are  related  types,
       including the 117L7GT,   but   no   direct   substitution.   Antique
       Electronic Supply in  Tempe AZ apparently  stocks  this  tube.   The
       tube, used as  indicated,  appears  very ordinary,  however  we  can
       assume that Tesla did not exactly follow RCA recommended application
       tolerances (i.e. he hacked it).
