                              Tesla on Radiant Energy

       It is well  known  that certain radiations - such as those of ultra-
       violet light, cathodic, Roentgen  rays,  or  the  like - possess the
       property of charging and discharging conductors of  electricity, the
       discharge being particularly  noticeable  when  the  conductor  upon
       which the rays impinge is negatively electrified.

       These radiations are generally considered to be Aether vibrations of
       extremely small wavelengths, and  in  explanation  of  the phenomena
       noted it has been assumed by some authorities that  they  ionize  or
       render conducting the atmosphere through which they are propagated.

       My own experiments and observations, however, lead me to conclusions
       more in accord with the theory heretofore advance by me that sources
       of such radiant   energy   throw  off  with  great  velocity  MINUTE
       PARTICLES OF MATTER which are strongly  ELECTRIFIED,  and  therefore
       capable of charging an electrical conductor, or, even if not so, may
       at any rate  DISCHARGE AN ELECTRIFIED CONDUCTOR either  by  carrying
       off bodily its charge or otherwise.

       A discovery which  I have made shows that when rays or radiations of
       the above kind are permitted to fall  upon  an INSULATED CONDUCTING-
       BODY connected to  one  of  the terminals of a condenser  while  the
       other terminal of  the  same is made by independent means to RECEIVE
       OR CARRY AWAY electricity, a current  flows  into  the  condenser so
       long as the  insulated  body  is exposed to the rays  an  INDEFINITE
       ACCUMULATION of electrical energy in the condenser takes place.

       This energy, after  a  suitable time interval, during which the rays
       are allowed to act, may manifest  itself  in  a  powerful discharge,
       which may be  utilized  for  operation or control of  mechanical  or
       electrical devices or rendered useful in many other ways.

       The insulated plate  or  conducting-body  should  present AS LARGE A
       SURFACE AS PRACTICABLE  to  the  rays  or  the  streams  of  matter.
       Furthermore, the surface  should  be  clean  and  preferably  HIGHLY
       POLISHED or coated.  The second terminal or armature of the

                                      Page 1




       condenser may be connected to one of the poles of a battery or other
       source of electricity  or to any conducting body or object whatever,
       of such properties or so conditioned  that  by its means ELECTRICITY
       OF THE REQUIRED SIGN will be supplied to the terminal.

       A simple way  of supplying positive or negative electricity  to  the
       terminal is to  connect  the  same  either to an insulated conductor
       supported at some  height  in  the   atmosphere  or  to  a  grounded
       conductor, THE FORMER, AS IS WELL KNOWN, FURNISHING POSITIVE AND THE
       LATTER, NEGATIVE ELECTRICITY.

       The sun, as  well  as  other  sources of radiant energy,  throws  of
       MINUTE PARTICLES of  matter  POSITIVELY ELECTRIFIED, which impinging
       upon a conducting  plate,  will communicate  continuously  upon  the
       plate an electrical charge.  The opposite terminal  of the condenser
       being connected to  the  ground,  which  may be considered as a VAST
       RESERVOIR OF NEGATIVE   ELECTRICITY,    a   feeble   current   FLOWS
       CONTINUOUSLY into the  condenser,  and inasmuch as  these  suppposed
       particles are of  an  inconceivably  small  radius or curvature, and
       consequently charged to  a  relatively  very  high  potential,  this
       charging of the condenser may continue, as I have actually observed,
       ALMOST INDEFINITELY, even to the point of RUPTURING THE DIELECTRIC.

             (what follows is excerpted from the Tesla Patent 685,957)
           Apparatus for the Utilization of Radiant Energy - 11/05/1901

       As light strikes  the highly polished plate, the highly  electrified
       particles which stream from all radiant masses is accumulated on the
       plate surface.  The   electrical   energy   is  accumulated  on  the
       capacitor plate and prevented from discharging by the damming action
       of the dielectric.   When  the electrical  breakdown  value  of  the
       capacitor dielectric can  no longer hold back the  intense  pressure
       (voltage) which has  built  up  on  the plate, a miniature lightning
       bolt passes through  the dielectric  to  the  bottom  plate  of  the
       capacitor to establish equilibrium of potential.  If  the  capacitor
       has an exceedingly high dielectric value (high capacitance) then the
       energy will take  the least path of resistance, which will be across
       the load as represented by the spark  gap  spheres common to Tesla's
       drawings.

       This perfectly illustrates  what  Walter  Russell taught,  that  ALL
       ENERGY flows in  Nature  begin  as an unpolarized or neutral energy.
       When separated, the energies take  on  both a spin (opposite to each
       other) and a   potential  proportional  to  the  distance   of   the
       separation.  These two polarized forces do all within their power to
       return to the common state of neutrality.  Another excellent example
       of this comes  from  the  work of the Russian scientist Kozyrev.  He
       used a rubber band as a simple example of the desire of opposites to
       rejoin.  Potential difference  increases   as   the  opposite  spins
       tighten.
