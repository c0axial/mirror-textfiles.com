  Are Pyramid Energy, Orgone and ZPE the same?

  Some odd correlations
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Pyramid energy and  the  Orgone  energy of Wilhelm Reich are supposed to be
  one and the same.  Orgone energy attracts  moisture  and  is seen as a blue
  mist.

  In an extended time exposure picture taken by D. J. Nelson, of a Tesla coil
  placed under a pyramid, you can clearly see a double helix  of  blue  light
  projecting from the top of the pyramid.  (see HARDY1 on KeelyNet)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  In the video  done  by  Floyd Sweet and Tom Bearden, the VTA (vacuum triode
  amplifier) is shown operating several  devices.  These devices are a mix of
  inductive and resistive loads.

  The device is  being driven by a 10 volt sine wave at about  29  microamps,
  yet is outputting something on the order of 300 Watts.

  At one point  in  the video, the camera is pointed at an AC motor.  You can
  clearly see this mysterious beam of  blue  light  that  projects  from  the
  energized motor.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  On speaking with  Tom Bearden about this, he mentioned  that  his  research
  team had also  gotten  such  a  blue  beam of light.  They are working on a
  device which also produces the "cold  current"  that  is similar to what is
  output by the Sweet VTA.

  Except in Bearden's case, the blue beam came from a DIODE.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  On speaking with Don Watson, he also said he had seen this  same  blue beam
  of light coming of his VTA machine.

  He tilted the  camera  to  see  if  it  was  some  kind  lens flare or scan
  frequency artifact and the beam stayed in position despite the camera
  angle or proximity.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  So, does this mean that we could use  a  tetrahedron  or  pyramid  shape to
  somehow entrain the ZPE as Joel McClain has long contended?
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  On discussing this with Dan Davidson, he suggests that the  negative health
  aspects of this  "cold  current" might be a result of getting in the way of
  this blue beam.  Dan also mentions that  it  is possible that the energy is
  being collimated and "sucked" into the device to sustain the load.

  If this is so, then it correlates with the Perrigo device  as  an "Aetheric
  Energy Transformer" and  with the work of Townsend Brown with "Gravitators"
  where aether/gravity energy is passed  through  a "layered pile" consisting
  of various materials (lead oxide, bismuth, etc.) shown to "resist" the flow
  of gravity to the extent of producing heat or electricity as byproducts.
