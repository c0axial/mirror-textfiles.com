                              FLOYD SWEET'S VTA UNIT
                                 by Walt Rosenthal

       Abstract

       The Vacuum Triode Amplifier (VTA) invented by Floyd  Sweet  consists
       of two ferrite  magnets  and  two to four coreless wire coils. It is
       self powered in the pre-ferred configuration  and produces in excess
       of one KW  of  120  VRMS  60  HZ power in the form  of  energy  that
       resembles electricity.  This  energy  is  referred  to  as  negative
       energy.   The VTA    development     history,    its    anti-gravity
       characteristics, negative energy  properties,  and   some   of   the
       personalities involved are discussed.

       This is a story of Floyd Sweet's trials and tribulations involving a
       mystery wrapped in  an  enigma.   God  revealed  to Floyd sufficient
       information to build  a machine to  provide  energy  that  resembles
       electricity.  However, God   did  not  provide  solutions   to   the
       frustrating string of  problems that would surface in converting the
       idea into a working device. There  are  several people in this story
       that have provided help and some who have hindered.

       When Tom Bearden  met  Floyd,  the  device Floyd had  developed  was
       producing a few watts of alternating current at 28 volts. Tom saw in
       Floyd's device the physical embodiment of a principle he had


                                      Page 1





       theorized many years  before.  Tom had never designed or constructed
       a physical device to access this elusive energy source.

       Tom's name for the extraction process  is 'Four Wave Phase Conjugate
       Mixing'. The energy source is the intense non-cohered energy that is
       thought to be   present   everywhere   in  the  universe.    Various
       researchers through the  years  have  given  this  energy  different
       names, such as "Zero Point Energy", "Gravity Field Energy", "Radiant
       Energy", and others.

       Tom Bearden gave Floyd's device the  name  "Vacuum Triode Amplifier"
       or VTA. The machine provides a small amount of its  output  fed back
       to the equivalent of a grid which gates or coheres a large amount of
       energy which appears at the device output terminal as something that
       resembles electricity!  Negative Electricity.

       This energy can   be   utilized   by  devices  designed  to  convert
       electricity to light, heat, or mechanical  work or anything else for
       which normal electricity is used.  The properties  of  this  energy,
       although superficially resembling  the  120  VRMS  60  HZ  power  we
       normally use, are   unique   and    sufficiently    different   from
       conventional electricity, so  that  it  should be classified  as  an
       entirely new energy form.  It will require careful extended study by
       a wide range  of  people  in order to document its properties in the
       manner scientists have done with conventional electricity.

       Tom Bearden refers to this energy  as negative energy, and he states
       that negative time must be utilized.  In  negative time according to
       Bearden, gravity is a repulsive force.

       Floyd's experiments demonstrated  that  the  VTA   loses  weight  in
       proportion to the  amount  of generated "Negative Energy".  This was
       carefully documented by Floyd on  a  kitchen  scale.    The  machine
       weight was observed  decreasing  with  increased  load  in  a  quite
       orderly fashion until  a point was suddenly reached when Floyd heard
       an immense sound, as if he were at  the  center of a giant whirlwind
       but without actual air movement.  The sound was heard  by  his  wife
       Rose in another  room  of  their  apartment  and was heard by others
       outside the apartment. The experience  was  very frightening and the
       experiment has not been repeated.

       Some observers of  the light emanating from ordinary  120  volt  100
       watt incandescent bulbs  powered  by  the  VTA  claim  the  light is
       different, softer, than normal incandescent light.

       The VTA magnets and coils when powering  loads  of  over  a kilowatt
       become cold and temperatures of 20 degrees Fahrenheit  below ambient
       have been observed.  Similar reports of below ambient temperature of
       energy machine components  have  been  reported  by other inventors,
       such as John Bedini and John R.R. Searl.

       When the VTA output wires had been  accidentally shortened, first an
       extremely brilliant flash  occurred.  When the wires  involved  were
       examined shortly afterward, they were found covered with frost.

       Unfortunately this also  caused  the  VTA magnet to fracture and the
       machine ceased operating.  In one  instance  the  machine  operation
       ceased during a  local  earthquake.  The  physical shaking  was  not
       believed to be sufficiently severe to disrupt the machine

                                      Page 2





       magnet/coil relative placement  or physical shock to the magnet such
       as a hammer blow might impart. The  best  speculation  is  that  the
       machine was affected by the intense electromagnetic  pulse  known to
       originate from earthquakes.

       Conventional instruments used  to  measure  volts,  amps,  or  watts
       appear to correlate machine output  as coupled to loads, but only up
       to approximately 1 KW; above that value they may  indicate  zero  or
       some other value not related to the known actual load.

       Floyd's attempts to  use  conventional  electrical  design  formulas
       relating number of coil turns, amp  turns  on  drive  coils, and any
       other parameter to  predict observed outputs have  all  resulted  in
       failures with calculations.   Empirical  formulas  based  on  actual
       tests have been documented.

       Observation of machine  output voltage  of  approximately  120  VRMS
       while the load was changed in 100 watt increments from  100 watts to
       1000 watts has  shown  no  observable  output voltage change,  which
       suggests an extremely low internal  equivalent  impedance.   The  20
       gauge magnet wire in the output coils consisting of  several hundred
       turns has significant DC resistance which is not correlated with the
       unvarying output terminal   voltage   at  different  loads.   It  is
       speculated that this energy does not  travel  within the copper wire
       or its passage through the copper wire does not generate  a  voltage
       drop - a most useful feature when transferring energy from one place
       to another.

       One frustrating aspect  of  the VTA has been its failures, evidenced
       by the output voltage slowly decaying  to zero over a few seconds or
       minutes.  There also has been spontaneous instances  of  the voltage
       rising above 120  VRMS  as  observed by the increased lamp load bank
       brightness. The volt  meters,  ammeter,  and  power  meter  did  not
       correlate with the brightness change except when the  machine  would
       the fail to produce any power.

       Many times the VTA was normally left on powering a lamp load bank 24
       hours a day.  During  a  period  of  time  when  it  appeared  to be
       functioning properly all day long,  Floyd got up at 3:00 AM to go to
       the bathroom. As he walked past the room where the  VTA was located,
       he noticed that the lights appeared dim.  He measured the voltage at
       70 VRMS. Being  tired  at  the moment, he returned to bed.  The next
       morning when he rose, the voltage  was  back  to the normal 120 VRMS
       and stayed there all day.  The next night Floyd got  up  at 4:30 AM.
       The voltage was  measured  at  85 VRMS.  Floyd returned to bed.  The
       voltage was normal the entire next day.

       A possible clue to this anomaly has  appeared  in an article by E.W.
       Silvertooth title 'Motion  Through  The  Ether'  where   Silvertooth
       describes a dual   path   laser   interferometer   experiment   that
       conclusively  demonstrated the  presence  of  an  ether  that  flows
       through our portion  of the universe at greater than  the  speed  of
       light with its  vector  in  the  direction of the constellation Leo.
       Floyd's VTA may  be orientation sensitive  to  this  ether  velocity
       vector.

       The VTA consists  of two 4" X 6" X .5" grade 5 or  grade  8  ferrite
       magnets spaced 3  inches  apart  in the attractive orientation, with
       the output and drive coils in between.  The output coils are wound

                                      Page 3





       with 20 gage  magnet  wire.  Their  axis is parallel to the magnetic
       lines of force  between  the  two   magnets.   The  two  drive   (or
       excitation) coil axes  are positioned at 90 degrees  to  the  output
       coil axis.  The VTA excitation coils may be driven by the VTA output
       voltage or a separate sinewave oscillator source.

       The  "SECRET" to  the  machine  is the process that "conditions" the
       magnets.  This conditioning process  determines the output frequency
       and also prepares the machine for operation.  The same machine could
       be just as well "told" to output 50 HZ or 400 HZ.   The conditioning
       technique is so  novel,  it is  doubtful anyone would ever guess how
       it is done.

       Oscilloscope observation of the VTA output voltage waveform shows an
       apparently perfect sinewave that is not phase locked to the local 60
       HZ powerline voltage.

       The VTA can be started by momentary  connection  of a 9 volt battery
       to the drive coils when the machine is operated  in the self-powered
       mode.  The operation is stopped by momentary interruption  of  power
       to the power coils.

       The VTA "likes" to always see a minimum load of 25 watts.

       Electrical shock to  humans  from  the VTA may be more damaging than
       contact with a 120 VRMS 60 HZ conventional powerline voltage.  Floyd
       has accidentally had VTA current pass from his thumb to his smallest
       finger. It appears to freeze the flesh and was extremely painful for
       at least two weeks.

       The mechanism by which negative energy  makes copper conductors cold
       but will also heat light bulb filaments is not understood.

       Tom Bearden has coined the term "Gravito Stiction"  for this process
       and has described how he believes it works.

       On the human side of the VTA development, some incidents  are  worth
       telling. Two people  from Australia, who claimed they wanted to help
       Floyd, stole his note book and promptly  asked  John Bedini for help
       in replicating the VTA based on the notebook contents.

       John recognized the  notebook  as  belonging to Floyd  and  promptly
       asked them to leave.  However, the notebook was never recovered.

       Floyd has received  many  death  threats  over  the  phone, and some
       threats face to face.  A well dressed gentleman in a expensive suit,
       tie, hat, and hundred dollar shoes  approached Floyd on the sidewalk
       of the street where he lives and introduced himself  as Cecil Brown.
       He showed him  a  picture of Floyd inside his apartment.  Cecil then
       told him that  he  represented a  conglomerate  that  did  not  want
       Floyd's device to appear in the world at this time.

       He further stated that sometimes unfortunate things happen to people
       who do not comply with the wishes of others.  He then  retrieved the
       picture and departed.   Incidences  like  this do impart significant
       concern in Floyd's mind!

       One real unsung hero of the human side of this story is Al Margolin,
       who for many years has provided test equipment, fabrication  help,

                                      Page 4





       and transportation for  Floyd  and  Rose whenever needed, and it was
       needed many times.

       Floyd's long time friend and former employer Bill Lawry has provided
       living and project expenses and fabrication help when needed.

       The reliable conditioning of the  magnets  in  a manner that assures
       long time operation is the Achilles heel of this device.

       With the help of enough of the right people this device  may  change
       our world and open a new field of physics!  This adventure of course
       is an ongoing  and the final goal of powering the world with the VTA
       is still a long ways off.

       Vangard Note

          A point of interest regarding the  "cold" effects associated with
          this negative  electricity.   Walter Russell, Victor  Schauberger
          and others  contend  that  nature  uses  two types of "spin", one
          clockwise, the other counterclockwise.

          The clockwise spin is a concentrating effect which generates Heat
          as a byproduct and is used in  all  modern  power  generation and
          utilization.  The  counterclockwise spin is an  expanding  effect
          associated with  cold  and  the  attempt  of nature to REGAIN the
          UNITY that prevails when force  of  any  type  (Aether, magnetic,
          light, electric, gravitic, etc.) IS NOT POLARIZED.

          In fact,  the very existence of electricity, magnetism,  gravity,
          heat, light,  etc.  is  NOT  possible  unless  the AETHER IS THUS
          POLARIZED to  create  the  interferences   necessary  to  provide
          potential differences  and  the "cascading forcefalls"  of  other
          energies which   MANIFEST   as   a  DIRECT  BYPRODUCT  of  Aether
          interference.  Two papers which  shed  some  light  on  this  are
          listed on KeelyNet as NEUTRAL1 and RFP1 if you might wish to look
          into some of our correlations.

          There are  also  several  .GIF  files  which might  help  you  to
          understand the  configuration  of  the  Sweet device.  These .GIF
          files also help to explain what  is believed to be actually going
          on with the machine based on our observations here at KeelyNet in
          conjunction with several of our users.

          Those files   are   listed   as  VTA1.GIF,  VTA2.GIF,   VTA3.GIF,
          BLOCH.GIF, BIFILAR.GIF, and COND.GIF and more later...
