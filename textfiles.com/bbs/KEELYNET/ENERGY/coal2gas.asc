           Texas A&M  researchers  interested  in coal-to-gasoline process.

       COLLEGE STATION, Texas --

            Texas A&M University researchers  want  to  resume the study of
       Nazi documents about producing gasoline from coal -  a  process that
       they say may alleviate the United States' dependency on foreign oil.

            More than  300  rolls of microfilmed documents dealing with the
       process are stored in the university's  library,  but  few have been
       translated or read.

            The documents detail Germany's research and development  of  25
       synthetic fuel plants from 1936 through 1945. The plants provided 90
       percent of the  Nazis'  aviation  fuel and 68 percent of the rest of
       its energy needs, the records show.

       Vangard Note...

            After the  war,  the  records  were  placed  under  a  30  year
       moratorium from the public to prevent the sudden release  of radical
       technology which might disrupt American businesses.
                                                                *******

            Texas A&M  researchers  began  gathering  and  scrutinizing the
       documents for practical application  in  1975,  but  the project was
       abandoned five years later.

            Arnold Krammer,  an  A&M history professor, told  the  `Houston
       Chronicle' that the  documents  also  record  the  U.S. government's
       short-lived synthetic fuel program.

            Two U.S. plants, built in Louisiana,  Mo.,  using  Nazi designs
       and technology, turned out 200 to 400 barrels of gasoline  daily for
       as little as  1.6  cents  per gallon from 1949 to 1953, according to
       U.S. Bureau of Mines records.

            That project   was   shut  down   by   President   Eisenhower's
       administration, Mr. Krammer, 49, said. "Without question, it was due
       to lobbying by  oil companies who didn't want the  competition,"  he
       said.

            Mr. Krammer and other A&M researchers tracked down Nazi Germany

                                      Page 1





       war documents in  diverse  locations that included basements in West
       Virginia, the Imperial Museum in London,  the  National Archives and
       the Library of Congress in Washington and German depositories.

            Most of the documents were captured and stored after the Allied
       victory over the Nazis in 1945. Many of the crates  had been stored,
       unopened, since the war.

            As a   result,   Mr.  Krammer  said,  Texas  A&M  is  the  only
       institution with most of the Nazi  and  U.S.  secrets  to  synthetic
       fuels.

            Mr. Krammer  said he hopes the project will obtain  funding  to
       hire a research  team  to  read,  translate  and  computer index the
       documents.  He estimated  the  project  would  take  five  years  to
       complete at a cost of about $200,000 annually.

            The chemical process for turning coal into gasoline is known to
       about every chemistry graduate student, he said.  But  it  generally
       has been considered uneconomical.

            He said,  however,  that  Nazi German research might unlock the
       keys to making the process cheaper than pumping petroleum.

            "It is the details that we have  in these documents, details of
       where the Germans  went  wrong,  and what worked and  what  did  not
       work," he said.

       Additional Vangard notes

          Chuck Henderson  said  he heard a local radio broadcast which was
       about the current  gas/oil  crisis   and   what   was   known  about
       alternative fuels.

          A caller from Fort Worth said he had access to the Nazi documents
       back in 1957 and had photocopied the them for his own  use.  He also
       claimed that he  had  successfully converted coal into gasoline at a
       cost of 10 cents per gallon.

          The man is George Vestal at (817)  497-4208.   I  called  him the
       next day but  he  was  out.  He later returned my call  and  sounded
       slightly manic as  if  he was hyper stimulated or overly excited.  I
       asked him about the radio talk show  and what he had.  He told me he
       had photocopied ALL THE NAZI DOCUMENTS in 1975 and  had  figured out
       how to convert the coal to gasoline.

          I then  asked  him  if  he  had found any information relating to
       electrical or flying  machines   and   he   said,   "Do   you   mean
       electromagnetic flying machines, yea, I have all that stuff."

          I told him of my particular interest in the Kugelblitz  and  that
       we could exchange information if he was interested.  He said no way,
       he was going to keep everything he had.  I asked him, "Well, what
       do you plan  to  do  with  it?" to which he replied, "If I can't get
       something out of it, I'll just keep  it  to  myself."  This included
       the coal to gas papers and processes.

          This information was passed around to various KeelyNet and

                                      Page 2





       Vangard Associates who contributed additional information.  A friend
       has a friend  who knows Arnold Krammer of A&M very well.  He had him
       ask Mr. Kramer about the papers.

          Krammer said that the only papers  which  were publicly available
       in 1975 were the coal to gas papers and not many people  had  access
       to them at  the  time.  As to claims that other information had been
       copied, he said impossible, as the  crates  had not even been opened
       TO THIS DATE.  This was before the above article was published.

          So, as far as I am concerned, Mr. Vestal might have  some  papers
       but not the advanced documents which we are interested in.

          To our  knowledge,  the  papers  are  under  the  second  30 year
       moraturium and not available to the public until 2005.
