       Since most of  us  here  at  KeelyNet  are  intensely  interested in
       becoming totally power independent, I felt the following information
       might be of  use  in understanding  just  what  are  the  electrical
       requirements to run your house.

       It is one thing to dream of the day when we will finally  be able to
       build or buy a system to run our vehicles or power our homes.  It is
       another to get  down to "brass tacks".  A one time purchase or lease
       that could be easily maintained and  supported for years of reliable
       operation is the goal.  This information will show  you  some of the
       realities.

       An electrical generator must be properly  sized for the load it will
       be called upon   to   handle.   Electric  motors  are   particularly
       difficult for a   generator   because  starting  an  electric  motor
       requires 2 to 3 times its nameplate rating or wattage.


                                      Page 1





       While electricity supplied   by   an   electric  power  company  has
       essentially infinite SURGE capacity  (limited  only  by  the circuit
       protection provided), a   generator  is  limited   by   the   engine
       horsepower and intertia  of  the  rotating  parts.   Thus, a current
       surge of short duration can be supplied  by  a generator, but with a
       current demand of  longer  duration such as a heavily  loaded  motor
       starting a high  inertia  system,  can overload a generator possibly
       damaging both the generator and motor.   A  3450  RPM air compressor
       motor is a prime example of this type of load.

       For this reason,  when determining the power your  generator  is  to
       provide, it is important to calculate electric motor requirements at
       3 times the  running  watts  to  compensate  for the surge needed to
       start the motor.  With this in mind, the following guidelines can be
       helpful in selecting the right size generator for your application.

          1.  Total the wattages of all small  appliances,  tools and light
              bulbs to be operated at the same time.  Most  appliances have
              labels showing  wattage (if volts and amps are given, volts X
              amps = wattage).  For example,  you  may  wish to operate the
              following equipment.

              Electric heater               1000 Watts
              Eight 100 Watt light bulbs     800 Watts
                                   Total    1800 Watts

         2.  Next determine volt-amperes (wattage) requirements of electric
             motors to be operated (e.g. furnace blower motor), remembering
             that the  starting  requires  2  to 3 times the  nameplate  or
             running (rated) watts.  Thus, if running watts of the motor is
             600, multiply  the  number  by  3  to determine the maximum VA
             needed.
                                  Running = 600 Watts
                           Starting = 600 X 3 = 1800 Max. VA

             The starting (max.) VA can also  be determined by referring to
             the motor  code  listing  which  indicates  starting  KVA  per
             horsepower.

         3.  Total  watts  and  VA  in  Steps  1  and  2  to  get the total
             requirements:
                                    Running      Starting
                      Step 1         1800 W       1800 VA
                      Step 2         +600 W      +1800 VA
                                     2400 W       3600 VA

                           +25%      +600         +900
                                     3000 W       4500 VA

         4.  To  allow  for  anticipated  future  needs  or  use  of  extra
             equipment, add 25% to the total load as in Step 3.

         5.  See  performance data charts at the bottom of  each  generator
             listing for the unit that meets your total load criteria.  For
             example, a  generator that provides at least 4500 max. VA (No.
             4W108) produces 4600 VA and  4000  watts  which meets the load
             required by  the example above.  A 3000 watt generator  should
             not have enough max. VA to start the electric motor load.

             NOTE: If more than one motor is to be started, start ONE MOTOR
                   at a time and always start the LARGEST FIRST.  If trying
                   to take  the  entire load of the generator from a single
                   receptacle, be sure ampere  rating  of receptacle is not
                   being exceeded.

             NOTE: Make sure that extension cords used with  generators are
                   properly sized  for  load  and  cord length.  Otherwise,
                   excessive voltage drops and generator loading may result
                   and CAUSE excessive heating of portable power tools.

                     Recommended Extension Cords for use with
                      Generators and Portable Electric Tools

       It is important to use extension cords  of adequate current carrying
       capacity when utilizing  a  generator  to operate portable  electric
       tools.  Undersized cords  result  in  excessive  voltage  drops  and
       additional power plant loading.  This  also causes excessive heating
       of the portable tool because voltage drop reduces tool capacity.

       In any power generation system, you have several options.   You  can
       generate power AS  YOU  USE IT, you can store the power in a battery
       network and convert it with the use  of  inverters (DC to AC) to run
       your appliances.

       We all would like to see some kind of virtual flux/ZPE tap, however,
       until such technologies are a reality, we have other  options.   The
       energy used is still the same, regardless of how it is generated.

       Personally, I think  the  first  systems  must  be  hybrids, using a
       combination of several  technologies.    So,   as  an  experimenters
       startup pack, I  suggest  you  download the file GARRETT1.ZIP  which
       contains the patent   and   .GIFs   for   the  Garrett  Electrolytic
       Carburetor as used to run a 4 cylinder automobile engine in the 30's
       here in Dallas.

       The basic principle  is to convert water to hydrogen and oxygen, mix
       it with air and explode these intermixed  gases  to drive an off the
       shelf engine.

       The idea is  to provide the motive force to turn a  generator,  that
       charges the batteries,  then an inverter converts the DC to AC as it
       is necessary to  run  the  house.    And  we  can  use  the  battery
       reconditioning technology that  applies  a 3.3Mhz frequency  to  the
       electrodes (3.3Mhz is  the  sulphur  NMR  frequency)  to  cause  the
       sulphates to redissolve into the battery acid.

       Anyway, hope you  get the point and  will  share  your  experimental
       results with all of us here at KeelyNet!
