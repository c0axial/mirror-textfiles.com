                      Inventor Planning Hydrogen-Powered Car

                                 By Robert Lindsey
                            (Special to The York Times)

            Los Angeles, April 20 - Sam Leslie Leach, the inventor of a
       controversial process that he contends can economically separate the
       hydrogen and oxygen in water, says he has refined his design and
       begun building a   system   that  will  be  capable  of  running  an
       automobile on hydrogen derived from water.

            Mr. Leach's invention has been the subject of both mystery and
       controversy since he  said  in   1976   that   he   had  devised  an
       economically efficient means of splitting water, a  contention  that
       promised a cheap  source  of  hydrogen  as  a replacement for fossil
       fuel.

            Mr. Leach, a multimillionaire  professional  inventor  who  has
       several basic patents  in the field of optics, has  been  trying  to
       interest the Federal Government and industry in his concept for more
       than three years, but has been largely ignored.

            For the  most  part,  scientists  have  ridiculed  the concept,
       arguing that it  violated basic  laws  of  physics.  Any  system  of
       splitting water, they contend, has to consume more energy than it
       produces.

                                Positive Evaluation

            Mr. Leach has refused to discuss the details of his system or
       how it purportedly  works.  but  last spring an innovation  research
       center at the University of Oregon financed by the National Science
       Foundation evaluated part of the technology over a period of two
       weeks and concluded that, that based on its analysis, it did not
       violate the laws of physics or thermodynamics.

            The center said that the process appeared to be technically
       sound and have commercial potential, but its report did not dampen
       skepticism in the scientific community.

            Two critics of the system, Howard Riese and Donald Bunker, both
       professors at the  University  of  California,  argued, for example,
       that it was impossible for such  a  system  to  work  as  Mr.  Leach
       contends because, in  effect,  it  would  be  a  "perpetual   motion
       machine." The inventor denies such a characterization.

            In an interview, Mr. Leach said that he had declined to make
       public any details until he had protected his rights to the process.
       Last fall, he  received  a  patent  on some elements of the process.
       Last week a second was issued by  the  United  States Patent Office.
       After its issuance he agreed to give some details of how the system
       purportedly works.

                                How System Operates

            In its  simplest  terms,  he  said,  the  process   utilizes  a
       lazer-like device to    generate    ultraviolet    radiation    that
       photochemically splits steam  into  oxygen  and  hydrogen.  It  then
       utilizes the electrostatic forces that normally bind  electrons  and
       protons in water  vapor  (and  which  are  released  in  the  water-
       splitting action) to maintain the reaction.

            In 1922, Niels Bohr, the Danish theoretical physicist, first
       defined the electrostatic forces that bind electrons and protons as
       "extranuclear" energy. Mr. Leach's  contention  that  he has found a
       way to use the energy in the way he describes is likely to evoke
       additional skepticism from other scientists.

            But he asserts that the process he utilizes to maintain the
       water-splitting action is identical with one observed by astronomers
       in energy interactions that occur in gaseous nebulae, the great
       masses of interstellar gas that absorb ultraviolet radiation from
       stars and re-emit it as visible light.

            The following is a more detailed account of how Mr. Leach says
       the system works:

            The reaction is started with an input of electrical energy from
            outside the  system,  from  a  battery or electric  line.  This
            energy is  converted,  by  using  an  "optical  pump" and other
            components, into large amounts  of  ultraviolet  radiation of a
            specific wavelength  that  is  precisely  tailored   to  ionize
            hydrogen and  oxygen  molecules  in the steam that has been fed
            into a tubular reaction chamber.

            The chamber  is  flooded  with   the   radiation.   During  the
            ionization, electrons  are  momentarily  liberated  from  their
            atoms and molecules.

                             Ionization and Radiation

            Microseconds later they are recaptured and recombined with the
       proton or nucleus of the atom. At this point, the energy that was
       required to ionize it reappears and radiates away.

            This radiation then ionizes another molecule. Very soon a chain
       reaction begins that involves millions of molecules and atoms.

            The process's concept, Mr. Leach said, manipulates the

                                      Page 2





       recombination of electrons   and  protons  as  hydrogen  and  oxygen
       instead of water vapor. Some of the  hydrogen,  he said, can be used
       to generate electricity to continue the initial input to the process
       and, in effect, be SELF-SUSTAINING AS LONG AS WATER IS PUMPED INTO
       THE SYSTEM.

            In 1975, before he publicized his work, the Presley  companies,
       a southern California  home  builder,  acquired  an  option  on  the
       process from Mr. Leach for use in  home  heating. The Securities and
       Exchange Commission investigated the company and alleged that it had
       issued false statements  regarding  its capabilities.  Subsequently,
       Mr. Leach reacquired  the option for the same price Presley paid for
       it.

            Mr. Leach asserted that he had demonstrated the validity of his
       theory in 11 experimental machines  that  split  water into hydrogen
       and oxygen. He said that the machine now being built for use in an
       automobile was of a more sophisticated design and was intended to
       drive a 245-horsepower automobile.

            A spokesman for a company that is assembling the device under a
       contract with Mr. Leach said it was hoped the machine would be ready
       for testing in early summer.

            Scientists have tried for more than a century to separate water
       into its two components, oxygen and hydrogen. Electrolysis, nuclear
       reactors and other  means  have been employed to do  so,  but  every
       method has consumed  far  more  energy  that  the  hydrogen that was
       produced.

            The availability  of a cheap  source  of  hydrogen  would  have
       immense implications for the world economy. Not only could hydrogen
       be used as a substitute for gasoline, but it would also be used as a
       replacement for home heating fuels and other energy sources.
