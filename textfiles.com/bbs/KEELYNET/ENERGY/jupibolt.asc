       Does Jupiter have new bolts?

       LOOK at it  this  way:  an  outfit  founded  and paid for by a Texan
       fried-chicken magnate hires (among  others) a physicist who has done
       government-sponsored work on extra-sensory perception.   After  nine
       years of secretive  research  it  says it has discovered that one of
       the basic laws of electronics can be breached and that its ideas can
       revolutionise the world of high technology.   That  is  how sceptics
       would describe the  activities  of Jupiter Technologies  of  Austin,
       Texas.

       Now look at  it  another way: a pioneering inventor and technologist
       with a distinguished  track record  claims  a  breakthrough  in  his
       field.  After preliminary investigations, scientists  and  officials
       from the CIA,  America's  armed forces and the departments of energy
       and commerce convene a special meeting  in Washington to look at his
       ideas.  Put that way it sounds less cranky.  Next week an assessment
       group set up  by  the  defence  department will try  to  distinguish
       crankiness from truth.

       The group will  be  investigating  what Jupiter's chief inventor, Mr
       Kenneth Shoulders, calls condensed-charge technology.  Mr Shoulders,
       who was for four years a staff scientist  at  the  Stanford Research
       Institute (SRI) in  California,  has  invented  and   developed   an
       extraordinary mixture of   gadgets,  ranging  from  tiny  radios  to
       backpack flying machines.  He is best  known as the father of vacuum
       micro-electronics, the technology  that  seeks  to miniaturise  old-
       fashioned vacuum tubes  to  a  scale where they can compete with the
       tiny transistors on silicon chips.

       Mr Shoulders thinks  he  can  use   simple  vacuum  micro-electronic
       components to compress electric charge in such a way  that  hundreds
       of billions of electrons can be packed into spheres one millionth of
       a metre across.   That  should  not be possible.  Particles with the
       same charge are meant to repel each  other.   It  normally  takes  a
       great deal of  force  to  persuade negatively charged  electrons  to
       cluster together against  their  natural  urges.   Powerful magnetic
       fields can do the trick.  But it takes relatively large and heavy
       equipment to generate the fields.

       Mr Shoulder's compression  devices   are,   he   says,   simple  and
       economical.  His tiny nuggets of pure charge, as dense  as  a solid,
       zip around at one-tenth the speed of light.  For Mr Shoulders, the

                                      Page 1





       patterns of tiny  bullet  holes  that  are  sometimes  produced when
       electrons are fired at various materials are marks of the impacts of
       charge-clusters (or EVs, as he also calls them).

       He thinks that EVs are in fact quite common--notably in the form of
       lightning, which he considers to be made of them.

       How might charge clusters overcome  the  forces  of  repulsion?  One
       theory (which Mr Shoulders himself is not wholly convinced  by)  has
       been proposed by Jupiter's resident theoretician, Dr Harold Puthoff.
       Dr Puthoff used  to  teach  at  Stanford University and work at SRI,
       spending a little of his time on extra-sensory  perception  but most
       of it on pastimes that are more usual for a physicist.   He  is  the
       co-author of a  widely used standard text on lasers.  He thinks that
       the secret might lie in the Casimir effect.

       The Casimir effect  depends  on a  paradoxical  finding  of  quantum
       physics: that empty space is full of energy, in a form  that  cannot
       be used or  even--under normal circumstances--observed.  This vacuum
       energy exerts a certain pressure on  all matter.  Since the pressure
       is normally the same in all directions, it tends not  to be noticed.
       However, when two metl plates are placed a few millionths of a metre
       apart, they can  shield  each other from the pressure, at least to a
       degree.  That means that the pressure  is  greater  on  the  outside
       surfaces of the plates than on their inward, facing  surfaces,  with
       the result that the plates get pushed together.  The force on the
       plates gets greater  the  closer  they  come.   That  is the Casimir
       effect.

       Dr Puthoff is much taken by vacuum  energy.  He has suggested that a
       variant of the Casimir effect may be familiar to  everybody  as  the
       force of gravity.   On  a  less  cosmic  scale, he suggests that the
       electrons in a ball of condensed charge  may  be acting like Casimir
       plates, shielding each other from the vacuum pressure.   The  vacuum
       pressure would squeeze  electrons  into  an  EV ball, which would be
       stopped from collapsing altogether by their natural repulsion.

       Dr Puthoff's explanation has some plausibility, but--as he realises-
       -would need much more detail to become  enticing.   However, leaving
       aside the whys of the EVs' existence, the hows of  their  use  would
       certainly be interesting.   An  electronic device that was based not
       on the movement of individual electrons (as today's devices are) but
       on the flow of dense packets of charge should be far faster and more
       efficient.  The EVs would not need to travel along wires; they would
       simply follow grooves etched in insulating materials.

       Circuits and other  basic electronic  devices  should  therefore  be
       relatively easy to  make,  according to Mr Shoulders.   The  grooves
       would be as  straightforward  to  fashion as those etched in today's
       compact discs.

       Jupiter Technologies has a wish-list  of applications for EVs.  They
       include medical X-ray  machines  the  size  of a pencil  (a  company
       called CBI Labs in Schenectady, New York says it has already made an
       X-ray device using   EV   technology),   flat-panel  high-definition
       television displays and  all  sorts   of  high-speed  communications
       devices and computers.   One  reason  that  military  agencies  seem
       especially interested is  that  electronic  devices using EVs should
       withstand the debilitating electromagnetic pulses created by nuclear
       weapons.

       The company, which  was  founded  in  1974  by Mr William Church (of
       Church's Fried Chicken), a rich and  retiring  amateur scientist and
       chess enthusiast, does not want to manufacture anything.   It  wants
       to license the  ideas that it is trying to parent.  Will it find any
       takers?  If this  month's  investigation  goes  well,  Jupiter  will
       probably have to  fight back the applicants, and Mr  Shoulders  will
       one day be  as  famous  as  the  inventor  of the transistor.  If it
       flops, EVs could end up as merely the strangest twist in the history
       of the fried chicken business.
