The following is a letter from Mr. William Hyde, inventor of the Hyde
Electrostatic Generator as detailed in HYDEPTNT, HYDEHATH and HYDEOFFR on
KeelyNet.  This device is claimed to be self-running and to output 20KW of
useable electrical energy.

The inventor has been impeded in his attempts to promote the manufacture of
his power generation system.  If it in fact works as claimed, then one of
these units could furnish all electrical power necessary to sustain two modern
homes (10KW each).

                                 URGENT APPEAL

        APPEAL TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR HELP WITH GOVERNMENT AND BIG
           BUSINESS SUPPRESSIONS OF NEW EMERGING ENERGY TECHNOLOGY.

Dear Fellow Americans,

Let me first introduce myself.  I am an independent inventor/engineer working
in advanced energy systems.  I have been very successful in creating the
advanced energy systems that all of us will need if we are to survive and
prosper in the coming years.

These energy systems use the natural forces of the electric, magnetic, and
gravitational fields without the need for the environmentally damaging fossil
fuels, nuclear, etc.  Some of my work is contained in Patent #4,897,592
Electrostatic Energy Field Power Generating Systems.

The United States Department of Energy and various large corporations have and
are attempting to suppress this new emerging energy technology.  They have
used vicious harrassment, death threats, blackmail, extortion and employ
people to file frivolous lawsuits to drain off resources to stop development
and manufacture.

I have been in court for five years over every concievable frivolous matter
one could think of.

Unless I recieve help from the American people, I will not be able to work in
this important energy technology area, as the costs of fighting a cabinet
level federal beauracracy and  billion dollar corporations is prohibitive.  My
legal cost over the last five years has been over $35,000.  I have lost over
30 foreign patents because of the government action.  The politicians wonder
why we have no economy, no jobs.

Please help one of America's most talented creative inventors by calling or
writing President Bush and your congressman to stop this outrageous attempt to
maintain the "status quo" greedy monopolies that rip you off day after day.

Please send me a short note of your contribution towards this effort with your
name and address and I will place you on a mailing list.  People on this list
will first be offered the stock of the corporation formed to manufacture this
new emerging energy technology plus will recieve technical updates.

Again, I ask for your help in this important matter.  I personally thank all
of you in advance for your help.  I look forward to hearing from you all.

                                                   Sincerely,
                                                   William Hyde
                                                   1685 Whitney
                                                   Idaho Falls, ID.
                                                   83402-1768
