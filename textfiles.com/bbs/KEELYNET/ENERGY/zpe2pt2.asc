                           Part II of Review and Outlook

       Another modification concerns  the  definition for the term "vacuum"
       in physics, as  documented by a paper  in  the  American  Scientist,
       March-April 1980, titled  "Is  The  Vacuum Really Empty?"  by  Prof.
       Walter Greiner, Univ.   of  Frankfurt,  BRD,  and  Prof.  Joseph  H.
       Hamiliton, Vanderbilt Univ., Nashville, TN.

       The authors conclude that a neutral vacuum is by no means as "empty"
       as the previously  claimed in our  textbooks,  and  suggests  a  new
       definition as follows:

            "The vacuum is the lowest stable state that a region of
            space can have WHILE BEING PENETRATED BY CERTAIN FIELDS".

       Because of the tremendous time lag in our educational system, many
       research projects and  their  ensuing experimental  data  have  been
       withheld from public  scrutiny.   The  scientific community tends to
       have a vested interest in preserving  the  system  it created and of
       which it is  a  part.   It  responds to new situations  through  the
       coloration of this attachment.

       A case in  point  are  the  carefully  conducted experiments of T.T.
       Brown with charged  bodies in a high  vacuum,  as  described  in  mt
       booklet Ether Fields (1977).  These experiments suggest  the  actual
       presence of certain   fields   in   vacuum,  whether  we  call  them
       gravitaional field, tachion-field,  ether  field, neutrino or Fermi-
       sea, etc. is of secondary importance at this moment.  Although Brown
       spent, reportedly, more than $200,000 of his own funds  over several
       decades on such  experiments, he was nevertheless unable to have the
       results published in the scientific media of America.

       Things are even worse when it comes to experiments conducted abroad,
       which often tend to confirm disregarded experimental results on this
       continent, as we  shall  see  shortly.    To   highlight   the  wide
       discrepancies between orthodox  (and  obsolete) dogmas  and  actual,
       physical realities pertaining to the true subatomic structures as we
       know them to  be  today, let us briefly review the structures of the
       matter:

       A molecule is  the  smallest  division   of  a  substance.   Further
       division would cause  it to cease being a substance.   The  smallest
       true molecules can be illustrated when we use the globe of the Earth

                                      Page 1





       for our standard.  If a single drop of water were magnified until it
       was as big  as the Earth, each molecule would be about the size of a
       tennis ball.

       On the next step down, an atom is the unit which makes up the nature
       of the molecule,  consisting  of the  nucleus  and  the  surrounding
       electrons to render the atom "stable".  An atom of hydrogen contains
       one proton and  one  electron to balance or neutralize  the  proton.
       Matter then is divisible into electrons and protons.

       But - and  here  comes  the  rub:  Between electrons and protons are
       spaces so vast, in comparison with  the masses of each, that, if the
       proton in the carbon atom were the size of a golf ball  hanging from
       a ceiling of the great hall at Pennsylvania Station in New York, its
       electrons would be  represented  by  six  small  wasps  winging in a
       little knot against the four walls of the gigantic structure of the
       building!

       In effect, one could claim there  is  a  little  final  solidity  of
       substance to anything: The Universe consists of "emptiness"' charged
       with electrical energy!    If  we  translate  the   above   to   the
       measurements and terminology of the physicist and "magnify" the atom
       mathematically, with all   its  distances  and  dimensions  kept  in
       proportion so that the orbit of the  electron  would have a diameter
       equal to that of the Earth about the Sun, approximately  184 million
       miles, the diameter of the electron itself would only be 2000 miles,
       and the diameter  of  the nucleus, where mass and weight of the atom
       are truly concentrated, can be taken as 2 miles only.

       We thus obtain a picture of a central  mass  with  a  diameter  of 2
       miles (nucleus), another object with a diameter of  2000  miles (the
       electron in the  case  of  the  hydrogen  atom)  at a distance of 92
       million miles away from it, orbiting  the nucleus.  Evidently, there
       is plenty of room inside this system.  And "room" is  not  a vacuum,
       it is not  nothingness,  but  space  itself, spatial energy, a field
       which can be identified with the ether of the past - and the future.
       Nobel prize winner, Max Planck, during a lecture in Florence, Italy,
       once made a truly remarkable statement  which  describes the problem
       facing the physicist today:

            "As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clear-
            headed science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as
            the result of my research about the atoms this much:
                           'THERE IS NO MATTER AS SUCH!"
            All matter  originates  and exists only by virtue  of  a  force
            which brings  the  particles  of an atom to vibration and holds
            this most minute solar system of the atom together.  We must
            assume behind  this force the  existence  of  a  conscious  and
            intelligent mind.  This mind is the matrix of all matter".

       This cosmic matrix is needed if we want to explain "action at a
       difference"' lines of force, stresses, a magnetic field  and  so on.
       When the concept  of  the ether was abandoned, it had to be replaced
       by the concept of "space" instead.   In  reality, we merely switched
       terminology.

       We used to say that "ether fills all space".  But  "filling"  is  no
       exactly the descriptive  word  to  use.   Perhaps  we  should rather
       define it: "Ether is a condition of space in which electrical

                                      Page 2





       manifestations for the atomic construction of material is possible".
       This primordial energy  is  "free"  or  in an uncondensed state.  It
       exists in interstellar space but  remains  unrecognizable  until  it
       begins to coagulate or gets into a vortex pattern.

       The claim of  our  textbooks  that  the Michelson-Morley  experiment
       "disproved" the existence  of  the  ether  is  incorrect.  It merely
       disproved the existence of a noticeable ether "drift" or "drag".  As
       an analogy, if someone would postulate  that  the  absence  of  wind
       disproves the existence  of the atmosphere around  our  planet,  the
       fallacy of this postulate would be immediatly apparent to all.

       "Michelson and Morley   centered  their  attention  on  the  Earth's
       orbital velocity (30 km per second).   They  had no knowledge of the
       existence of galaxies; of motions of galaxies in  relation  to  each
       other; of the  motion  of  our solar system in our galaxy....  Their
       negative results are explainable on  the basis of pre-1900 classical
       mechanics, so provide no proof of the absence of ether  or  Louis de
       Broglie's 'subquantic medium'.

       Thus, the limited   information   to   Michelson   and  Einstein  is
       emphasized by recent findings, particularly  in astrophysic", writes
       Dr. H.C.  Dudley  in  the  Bulletin  of the Atomic Scientists,  Jan,
       1975, under the title "Michelson's Hunch Was Right".  And Dr. Dudley
       continues: "In fact,   1929   saw   Michelson  still  attempting  to
       experimentally demonstrate the   ether,   which  his  intuition  and
       reasoning told him ought to be present".

       "Today most persons are largely unaware that the ether concept began
       to be seriously reexamined by two of physics most notable laureates.
       The ether is now being called the "neutrino sea" by astrophysicists,
       and has been characterized as an energy-rich particulate, subquantic
       medium.  A rather   voluminous   literature  on   the   subject   is
       accumulating as indicated  by  a recent review, The Cosmic Neutrino,
       with 655 references covering only the period 1965-1972.....

       It appears that an open-minded reexamination of this area of physics
       is long overdue in order to open  up  new  avenues of approaching to
       this pressing problem.
