                                   PIPE T

       This project requires mechanical ability and knowledge of automobile
       fuel delivery systems.   Since  raw  gasoline  is involved with this
       project, safe practices are absolutely  required....No Smoking....No
       flames....Use your head !!!

       This design is  based on Patent No. 3,227,427 issued  1/4/1966,  now
       expired.

       The drawing illustrates   a   device,  according  to  the  inventor,
       achieves a 50 to 100% improvement in gasoline mileage.  The inventor
       claimed that he  achieved 50 miles  per  gallon  with  a  full  size
       Chevorlet sedan equipped  with a 327 cu in V8 motor.   He  sold  the
       patent to Gulf Oil for $54,000 in 1968.

       Before going any further, keep in mind while reading this, that only
       gasoline VAPORS burn  in  an  engine.   Anything that has not turned
       into vapor, gets blown out the exhaust  pipe  and into the catalytic
       converter, where it  is burned.  That's why the catalytic  converter
       get so very hot.

       There are three ways gasoline is vaporized:

            Evaporation, heat and vacuum.

       This device uses  engine  vacuum to vaporize liquid gasoline that is
       sprayed, blasted or jetted, against the head of a carriage bolt.

       The head of  the carriage bolt or  other  such  domed  or  spherical
       shape, provides a  large, extremely thin layer of  gasoline  for  to
       make it easier  for the vacuum to "rip" into vapor.  Liquid gasoline
       that does not  turn  into vapor,  collects  in  the  bottom  of  the
       chamber, drains down to a pipe T, connected to the  suction  side of
       the fuel pump,  and  re-circulates over and over, until it is turned
       into vapor.

       Make up gasoline, as needed, flows  from the fuel tank, normally.  A
       vapor lock will not occur.  Vapors are sucked out  of  the  chamber,
       via the 3/8  vapor line (E), into a vacuum portion of the carburetor
       (see construction details).

       Construction Details

       The device has been built, using  a  pint  salad dressing jar as the
       container.  The inventor indicated that he originally used a large

                                      Page 2





       Pipe T for  his  prototype.  Until experience is obtained, the glass
       jar is recommended so that the flow  rates of the liquid, levels and
       vapor can be  observed during experimentation.  Using  a  1/2  inch,
       glass drill bit,   drill  a hole in the bottom and sides of the jar.
       Position the holes directly opposite  each  other  and midway on the
       jar.

       Use kerosene as a lubricant for the drill bit, and  take  your  time
       while drilling.  Use  a  light  pressure  on  the drill, and let the
       drill bit do the work.  Being extremely  careful,  install  3/8 inch
       brass compression fittings in the holes drilled in the glass jar.

       Use large diameter  fender washers on both sides of  the  glass  for
       reinforcement.  The washers  are  glued on the jar, using a silicone
       glue (Elmer's).  The washers will better fit the jar, if the washers
       are bent slightly to conform to the curvature of the glass jar.

       The compression fittings are then  installed  into  the  washers and
       jar.  Tighten the fittings on the outside of the jar before you
       install them in the jar.  The fitting nut on the inside  of  the jar
       must be tighten very carefully or the jar will crack.

       Use a silicone  sealer  not  affected by gasoline, as a sealer.  The
       jar MUST be air tight.  It may be  necessary to enlarge the holes in
       the washers to  provide clearance for the compression  fitting.   To
       use  1/4" copper  tubing  in  a 3/8" compression fitting, solder a 2
       inch piece of 3/8 tubing on the end  of  the 1/4 copper tubing, that
       fits into the 3/8" fitting.

       Install a 3/8" compression fitting in the lid of  the  jar.   If the
       jar lid is  made of thin material, it may be necessary to use fender
       washers on both sides of the lid as reinforcement.

       The spherical or domed shaped object (A), is mounted so that the jet
       of gasoline sprayed out of the nozzle  (D), hits the exact center of
       the dome.  A 5/8 " carriage bolt or a stainless steel  teaspoon, are
       ideally shaped.  The idea here is, to create as large and thin sheet
       of gasoline as possible, so the vacuum will rip it apart.

       However, be careful  not  to make it so large that raw gas is sucked
       into the vapor  supply  line  to  the  carburetor.  (A  teaspoon  is
       suggested after seeing  the  large  thin  sheet of  water  that  was
       created by holding the spoon beneath a kitchen faucet.)

       The teaspoon can  be mounted by bending the handle, so that the wide
       part of the  handle  can  be supported  by  the  nozzle  compression
       fitting.  Some experimenting may have to be done, to  determine  the
       optimum position of  the  spoon.   Drill a hole in the handle of the
       teaspoon, to mount  the  spoon on  the  supply  nozzle,  compression
       fitting.

       The vapor supply  line  to the engine (E), is a 3/8  or  5/16  line,
       connected to the  carburetor or to a plate beneath the carburetor or
       in the case  of a fuel injected  engine,  in  the  main  engine  air
       intake.  Before a  connection  is made to any of these  points,  the
       following information  must be considered:

       o  Ideally, a  device  such  as this, should be usable while idling,
          slow speed while in traffic and high speed cruising.  It should

                                      Page 3





          also provide  enough  vapors  during acceleration.  However, this
          will be the most difficult to achieve without supplementary help,
          when using vapor.

       o  When accelerating, engine vacuum  is  low, and will not be enough
          to change the liquid gasoline into vapor.  Vacuum  will  be  high
          when idling and decelerating.

       o  A vacuum  will  always be produced, except while idling, when the
          vapor supply tube is placed in  the  fast  moving,  engine intake
          air.  Vapor will be sucked out of the container  exactly  the way
          paint is sucked up, in a siphon spray gun.

       o  The outlet  of  the  3/8" pipe that brings in the vapors, must be
          positioned in a fast moving air  stream  to  draw out the vapors.
          The best spot on a carburetor, is directly in the  middle  of the
          ventura.  However  this  is  now occupied by the jets.  On a fuel
          injected engine, the vapor line  should  be  placed  in  the main
          engine air intake.

          On both the carbureted and fuel injected engine, the vapor intake
          tube should be no less than 3/8 inch diameter and  the end cut to
          a 45  degree angle.   The best of all areas of performance: start
          up, idling and cruising, can be  obtained  by removing the entire
          jet assembly  out of the ventura of the carburetor,  and  leaving
          the accelerator  pump and jet, and the idling jets.  Connect fuel
          lines to both the container and  the existing carburetor, using a
          compression T fitting.

          Gasoline will be required by the carburetor only, when idling and
          accelerating.  Seal the holes left by the removal  of  the  jets,
          with an  epoxy  sealer,  such as JB Weld.  Locate and drill a new
          hole for insertion of the vapor  supply  tube in the exact middle
          of the  main  ventura.   Install  a  3/8  inch brass  compression
          fitting in  the  hole  drilled into the ventura.  This will allow
          the vapor pipe to be moved in and  out, for the optimum position.
          Position the  45  degree cut tip, exactly in the  middle  of  the
          ventura.

          If you  decide  not  to  modify  the  carburetor, and use a plate
          beneath the carburetor to bring  the vapors into the engine, keep
          in mind  that  maximum  vacuum  will  occur  when   idling,   and
          decelerating, while the carburetor butterflys are closed.  Vacuum
          will drop drastically when accelerating, and performance will
          suffer.

          On the  fuel  injected  engine,  locate  a spot in the engine air
          intake where the air is moving  the  fastest.   The  vapor supply
          tube is  installed at that point.  On computer  controlled,  fuel
          injected engines,  when  engine  vacuum is low, the fuel injector
          will provide  the  raw  gasoline   for   acceleration.   This  is
          accomplished automatically by the engine computer.

          When vacuum  is  low,  and insufficient vapor  is  fed  into  the
          engine, the  engine  Oxygen  sensor  will  sense  the  lean  fuel
          mixture.  The computer turns on the fuel flow to the injectors to
          overcome the lean fuel mixture.   When the engine vacuum is again
          high, vapors will be produced.  When the Oxygen sensor senses the
          rich mixture as a result of both vapors and the injectors

                                      Page 4





          providing fuel  to the cylinders, the engine computer will reduce
          the fuel flow to the injectors,  until the raw gasoline is turned
          completely off.

       o  Install a small valve in the 1/4 inch drain line, to make
          adjustments.

       o  Locate the container as close to the carburetor or vapor input to
          engine, as  possible.  Locate the container slightly  lower  than
          the vapor  entrance point on the carburetor or intake manifold of
          fuel injected engines, to reduce  the  chance  of liquid gasoline
          from getting  into  the engine.  Keep the vapor  supply  line  as
          short as possible.

       Turn Up

       Connect the fuel   line   from   the   fuel   pump,   to   both  the
       carburetor/fuel injectors and the  vaporizer  container.   Install a
       valve in the gasoline supply line to the carburetor.   Now  for  the
       most difficult part:

           Start the engine.  Adjust the vapor supply line in and out of
           the carburetor or intake manifold, for maximum vapor
           production.

           The very  volatile  gasoline  vapors,  will  resemble light gray
           smoke.  Adjust the drain line,  so that gasoline just covers the
           bottom of the container.

           A small  amount  will be needed to make maximum  vacuum  in  the
           chamber.  The weight of the liquid gasoline in the bottom of the
           vaporizer and  the  drain  line, acts similar to a one way check
           valve.  If gasoline begins to  build  up  in the container, open
           the valve accordingly.

           On the carbureted engine, when the engine begins to stumble
           and produce black smoke indicating it is too rich,  slowly  shut
           off the liquid gasoline flow to carburetor.

           If everything is right, the vapor chamber will be producing
           enough vapors  to  keep  the  engine running.  Drive the car and
           insure that enough vapors are  being  generated while the engine
           is running at higher speeds.  Decelerate, and  insure  that  raw
           gasoline is  not  building  up in the container faster, than the
           drain line can handle.

           This will require making several  adjustments to both the supply
           nozzle and the drain line, before a balance is achieved.

       Hopefully, you now  understand  the  basic  principle   behind  this
       device.  Once you  have  understood  the theory and operation of the
       device, and know what adjustments  are  made,  the  glass jar can be
       replaced by a metal container, which is considerably safer.

       Additional Information that may be helpful:

          1)  Some brands of gasoline will vaporize easier than others.
          2)  Summer gasolines have additives included, to restrict
              evaporation.  Winter gasolines have little if any, additives.

                                      Page 5





          3)  Evaporation may be enhanced and the effective power of the
              gasoline increased, by installing a charcoal filter on the
              output of the fuel pump.  The charcoal removes most of the
              additives, paraffins and varnishes, found in the gasoline.
          4)  Use a paper filter on the output of the charcoal filter to
              prevent minute  particles  of  carbon  from  getting into the
              injector or the carburetor.  Only activated charcoal will do.
              Whole house charcoal water filters, will do the job.

       Eventually, the charcoal  will become  saturated  with  all  of  the
       garbage it has removed.  Replace when a reduction in  performance is
       noticed or 5000 miles.

       A great carburetor  cleaner or fuel injector cleaner, can be made by
       adding 1 ounce of Naptha (found at  paint  stores), to one gallon of
       gas.

       Octane can be boosted by adding 1 ounce of Isopropyl  alcohol  and 1
       ounce of Methanol,  to  a gallon of gasoline.  Check drug stores and
       paint stores.
