                         *****   Please NOTE!!  *****

  This is a preliminary report that will be followed by updates with more
  detail.  Future versions will include various measurements of the components
  used in the ciruit that is currently running.  From all appearances at this
  date, the circuit components will simply give varying outputs and do not
  appear to be all that critical.

  It was felt that this information should be released to the public as
  rapidly as possible, rather than risk loss of the information or the demo by
  'circumstances' beyond our control.  There have been too many discoveries
  which have disappeared by not being openly shared.  We would rather risk
  being 'flamed' by other experimenters who actually BUILD THE CIRCUIT than
  take the chance of the information being lost by keeping it within a select
  group.

  Our two primary fears are that someone will attempt to patent what is
  intended to be a gift to humanity, possibly with an intent to profit from
  others work or to lock it away, the other that it might be suppressed in
  some other fashion.

  Therefore, the widest possible distribution is requested, and duplication
  attempted wherever possible.  At the time of this correction to the original
  file, we have confirmation as to the numbers and others are working on the
  circuit on their own.  Please take this information in the spirit of how it
  is given, as a gift to humanity.

               The inventors are Joel McClain and Norman Wootan.
                You can contact them via KeelyNet or directly.

  The circuit is being tested at various levels and attempts at duplication
  are under way.  At this point, there is only one circuit.  We will openly
  post other successful duplications or failures.  Please feel free to try it
  yourself.  The cost is minimal.

  One other point, the crystal transducer was thought to be barium titanate
  and there is reason to believe it is in fact titanium zirconate.  These are
  disc shaped, about 3" in diameter with a 1" diameter hole in the center.  The
  disc is about 3/8" thick and is coated with silver on both sides.  Thank you
  for your open-mindedness.  They are advertised in the back of many
  electronics magazines for about $5 each.  We have access to a small stock
  and might offer them for experiments should people ask for them.

                         Good luck and SEIZE THE DAY!

                    The Magnetic Resonance Amplifier (MRA)

                    Discovered and proven December 12, 1994
                and shared with the world on December 13, 1994

                       by Joel McClain and Norman Wootan

MRA is the Magnetic Resonance Amplifier.  With low level ultrasonic input
signals, the MRA produces usable direct current power at levels above unity.
This circuit is based upon the work and theories of John Ernst Worrell Keely,
and is offered into the public domain in his memory.

Without lengthy discussion about the ether, tetrahedral geometric virtual
rotation, mass aggregate resonance or the rule of nines, it is possible to
understand this circuit as basically a tuned magnetic and quartz amplifier.

However, it WAS necessary to study those subjects in order to design and build
the MRA, so if you want to fully realize how it works, avail yourself of the
files on KeelyNet which contain all of that and much, much more.

In the schematic, MRA.GIF, there is a tunable low power oscillator, which
supplies a signal to one side of a barium titanite transducer.  The opposite
side of the transducer is connected to a primary coil, which is wrapped around
a barium ferrite magnet core.  The opposite end of the primary goes back to
the oscillator.

A secondary is wrapped around the primary, and is connected to an ordinary
bridge rectifier, and the output of the bridge is applied to a DC load.  A
filter capacitor can be used on the output of the bridge, and was used on the
MRA which we built.  Additionally, a load resistor across the capacitor will
keep the output DC from getting too high as the circuit is tuned.  We found
that a 30 ohm, 10 watt resistor was sufficient.

Once this has been assembled, put a voltmeter across the output resistor to
monitor the voltage rise as the circuit is tuned.  Adjust the oscillator
frequency to provide the highest DC output.  During this process, be aware
that the voltages across the piezo and the coil will be VERY MUCH HIGHER than
the signal level which you are applying.  We have seen combined voltages of
almost 1000VAC with only 30VAC of signal input.

When the circuit is tuned, the magnet will be "singing" at around 8000 to
11000Hz.  If the piezo sings, you are exceeding its power capabilities, and
will need to reduce the number of turns on your primary.  The frequency that
resonates both the piezo and the magnet at optimum resonance will be three
times (three octaves above) the frequency at which the magnet is singing.
This is the nine harmonics that are mentioned in the Rule of Nines.

To test the circuit, place a precision, high wattage, low ohm resistor in
series with the output from the oscillator to the piezo, and measure the
voltage drop.  It should be very small, less than 0.1VAC.  Use this value to
determine current in the series circuit, and then calculate power.

Next, measure the DC voltage across your output load resistor, and once again
calculate power.  You should be between three to four times above the
previously calculated input power.

Once the circuit is in operation, you will note that the voltage will vary by
0.1VDC or more, depending upon the time of day.  This is due to the nature of
etheric forces inherent to the earth's magnetic field.  Watch for peak voltage
at or before sunrise.

In our circuit, we measured 0.084VAC drop across a two ohm series resistor,
for a total of 0.685W dissipation in the primary.  With this, we attained
2.75W of output power, and used this to drive a lamp and a motor.  Increasing
the signal voltage had the effect of decreasing the primary current while
boosting output power, thus improving the power gain ratio.  We believe that
larger power systems can be built by using larger coils, more piezos, and a
lower frequency, as long as the aggregate combination is within the resonant
frequency range of the components.

The MRA is essentially a means of releasing the electrical energy stored in
magnets.  As such, it is an AC battery with DC output.  It can be used for a
portable, self-charging power supply with a solid state oscillator and
rechargable battery.  For those who want a synopsis of the technology, the
following paragraphs are offered, but it is strongly suggested that you follow
up this reading with a more thorough study of the KeelyNet files.

Matter = energy.  To change the matter, change the energy.  Creation of a
magnet is achieved by a process which causes the matter to be both expanded 
and compressed at the same time, with the result that a magnet is in a constant
state of collapse.  This is why magnets attract material with similar lattice
structures, as they attempt to fill the energy void which created them.  The
"domains" of the magnet are fixed after the process of magnetization, and the
only way to extract electrical energy is to physically spin a coil relative to
a magnet.

However, it is also possible to induce virtual rotation by applying the
resonant frequency of the magnet, which causes the lattices and the domains to
vibrate.  However, the power required to do this is greater than the energy
released by the virtual rotation.  Therefore, it is necessary to increase the
vibration without using excessive current.

The piezo has a virtually inexhaustable supply of free electrons, and it
releases them when it is stressed.  Using the piezo in series with the primary
coil will almost eliminate primary current, because it is voltage which
stresses the piezo, not current.  Therefore, the piezo can be stressed with
very little actual power, and provide the current to the primary coil, which
vibrates the domains of the magnet.

The piezo is the catalyst for the circulating current with the primary coil.
The circulating current is additive, and this is the reason for the high
potentials developed across both the piezo and the primary coil.

It is at this point that resonance becomes important.  You MUST have three
octaves of separation between the magnet resonant frequency and the signal
applied to the piezo.  The circulating current is rich in harmonics, and this
is necessary for the operation of the circuit.

Although the circuit is simple, it utilizes the concepts of PHI, of virtual
rotation, of tetrahedral geometry, piezo and transformer theory, and
electrical knowledge.  It is not suggested as a beginner project as a result
of the high voltages present.  For engineers and technicians of experience, it
may be difficult to accept that the MRA is above unity.  The ramifications are
emormous.  Hopefully, it will help to build a better world.

Vangard Note

  This device incorporates power multiplication principles using multiple
  resonances as claimed by Keely and Hendershott.  It also corresponds in some
  ways with Floyd Sweet's VTA and Joe Parr's energy spheres from pyramids.

  Joel called Sunday night in an excited state.  He and Norman took turns
  explaining what they had achieved using this circuit.  The power input
  measurements were about 600mWatts and yet the circuit was generating about
  2.5 Watts on the output.  Norman hooked up a DC motor and he said it was
  spinning like crazy in addition to a light bulb glowing brightly.

  Norman was laughing and said they'd beat Harold Puthoffs' One Watt Challenge
  as issued at the 1994 ISNE conference in Denver.  This has created quite a
  bit of excitement and Puthoff now has a FAX'd copy of the circuit.  No doubt
  it will be everywhere in a very short time.  The hope by Joel and Norman is
  that others will duplicate the initial effect and be able to expand on it to
  derive useful power.

  Sweet claimed something on the order of 1:3,000,000 over-unity.  The input
  power to his device was 10 VAC at 29uamps (290mWatts).  The output had been
  loaded to as high as 3,000 Watts.

  The initial MRA circuit is something on the order of 1:5 and is believed to
  be scalable.  Joel says the coil he had wound around the barium ferrite
  magnet was not in the least precision and he is of the mind that a huge coil
  surrounding the magnet will produce a proportional increase in power.

  Early talks with various KeelyNetters about the Sweet circuit led many of us
  to believe that Barium, when excited, rings for a long time when the exciter
  is removed.  At the ISNE conference, Don Watson confirmed this with his
  analogy of glowing luciferase as found in fireflys or other phosphorescent
  materials.  A weak stimulation continues to produce light for a time after
  the stimulation is removed.

  So, here is a wonderful opportunity to build a pioneering device.  If you
  have questions or suggestions, you may direct them to Joel McClain or Norman
  Wootan at KeelyNet.

  I think they both need to be commended for their willingness to share what
  many would keep proprietary or die with the secret.............>>>  Jerry
