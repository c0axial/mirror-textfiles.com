       Pietrus Peregrinus, in  1269,  was a French officer in the crusades,
       as well as an inventor whose discoveries have changed the world.  It
       was he who first discovered the "pole" relationships of magnets, and
       his "north" - "south" nomenclatures  remain  to  this  day.  He also
       invented the first  graduated  and  calibrated compass,  with  which
       others went about discovering the rest of the world.

       Peregrinus also is believed to have invented the first magnet motor,
       consisting of 17 magnets, and three wheels connected to three gears.
       The simplicity of the design belies the inventor's understanding of
       both the mechanical and magnetic principles involved.

       Using the gear configuration shown, the naturally occuring magnetic
       oscillations are damped by the counter-rotation of the large wheel.

       This permitted the wheels to rotate smoothly.  A single "unbalancer"
       magnet is used to start the rotation, and to continue rotating the
       wheels at the resonant frequency of the aggregate mass.

       I would guess that the speed of the rotation would depend upon the
       strength relative to the weight of the disks and the friction of the
       gears.  Torque would  depend  upon  the  number of "unbalancers", as
       well as their positioning in the magnetic fields.

       This design was translated into English  in  1954, and built.  After
       it was proven to work, it was disassembled and destroyed.   However,
       the English translations  are  still  available at the New York City
       Public Library.  Enjoy!
