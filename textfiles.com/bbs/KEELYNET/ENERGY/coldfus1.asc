              From the Williamsport, PA _Sun-Gazette_, April 25 1991:

                      FIRM CLAIMS COLD FUSION MYSTERY SOLVED

                      Lancaster Company's Assertion Disputed

       SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A Pennsylvania company claims to have solved
       the puzzle of cold fusion.

       Mills Technologies, of Lancaster, Pa., claims to have determined a
       non-nuclear mechanism for  the  purported phenomenon reported at the
       University of Utah two years ago.   Mills  also says it has made the
       effect reproducible.

       The company attributes the effect to a previously unknown reaction
       that creates a new, smaller form of hydrogen.

       The explanation disputes much of the quantum mechanical theory that
       has guided nuclear scientists most of this century,  and was greeted
       with some skepticism by other scientists.

       "Basically, we have  both  the  theoretical  and  practical  aspects
       solved," Mills' owner,  Randell   L.  Mills,  said  in  a  telephone
       interview Wednesday.

       The company scheduled a news conference in Lancaster today.

       Mills said his company of about a half-dozen employees has built its
       own cells that  have  produced up to 40 times the electrical  energy
       put in.

       He also said  the  heat production works with ordinary water as well
       as heavy water, and it does not require a palladium electrode.

       University of Utah researchers Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann
       stumbled on to the process "by serendipity"  and  they were wrong in
       their assumption that  nuclear  reactions were creating  the  excess
       heat, Mills said.

       But since hydrogen  from  ordinary  water is the fuel, the prospects
       for use as an energy source are still very good, he said.

       Mills also said the effect is "100 percent reproducible" and the
       company has applied for patents worldwide.  Reproducibility has been
       a major hindrance in the acceptance of the phenomena.

       Under the theory, the electrons in hydrogen atoms drop to previously
       unknown energy levels  below  the  "ground  state" thought to be the
       lowest level under  conventional  quantum  mechanics.   Dropping  to
       these lower levels requires a release of energy as heat.

       A paper is to be published in the August issue of the Journal of
       Fusion Technology, where  a  number of cold-fusion-related  articles
       have appeared, Mills  said.  He will speak on the work at the August
       meeting of the American Chemical Society in New York City.

       Fritz Will, director of the National Cold Fusion Institute at the
       University of Utah, was out of the  country.   Haven  Bergeson,  who
       directs the physics group for the institute, said he  was unfamiliar
       with Mills and his work and could not comment on its specifics.

       "On the surface, it seems like an unlikely idea," Bergeson said.
       "It's a line  of  thinking  that  I  don't  think  any  of  us  have
       followed."

       John Huizenga, a University of Rochester  nuclear  chemist  who  co-
       chaired the Department of Energy's cold-fusion review panel, said he
       also knew nothing of the work, but thought it difficult  to take the
       claim seriously at this point.

       Huizenga, who has previously said that cold fusion would require "a
       succession of miracles,"  said  the  Mills  work  appears to be more
       willingness to surrender a well-accepted  and  proven theory for the
       sake of sketchy experimental evidence.

       "When surprise upon surprise upon surprise comes along,  one  has to
       be very careful," he said.

       Mills said his company was formed in 1986 as a research-oriented
       business.  He said  his  background  includes a bachelor's degree in
       chemistry and a medical degree from  Harvard  University.   He  also
       studied electrical engineering  at  the Massachusetts  Institute  of
       Technology.
