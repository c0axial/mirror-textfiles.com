         This is the second of a two part file (FREE-N1 and FREE-N2).

The electrical dynamo patented by Barbara Hickox (1991) is an interesting
device.  The design includes a central rotating non-conductive cylinder into
which small cylindrical permanent magnets are placed.  The interesting part is
that the magnets are all positioned with one pole outward, and located on two
spiral lines down the surface of the rotating cylinder.  Barbara claims that
when properly designed, single-wound coils in the proximity of these rotating
magnets will exhibit power transfers much higher than the power required to
turn the cylinder.  Again, here is the idea of a spiral or cyclic texture
within the substance of existing energy fields.

It must be pointed out here that accurate measurements of high frequency power
can be difficult to make and results can be inferred that are very much in
error (Triner & Hansen, NASA, 1977).  All measurements of input and output
voltages and currents must be very carefully performed.

The Bedini free energy generator (1991) was also discussed.  Complete plans
are given for the construction of a free energy system.  While not an over-
unity device, the battery recharging circuit does allow a battery to operate
for a much longer period of time than it normally would, thus giving the user
that much more energy for free.  However, it was pointed out that certain
circuit components, such as the transistor numbers, may be in error in these
plans, and that a brand new battery must used.  Refer to Moray King's 1992
paper for more details.

Gary Johnson (1992) reported that electrically induced explosions in water
exhibiting free energy are relatively easy to produce with a 2 micro-farad
capacitor charged to 10 kiloVolts.  "Expanding steam does not seem to be the
main cause for the explosions.  Similar explosions are obtained with
significantly different peak currents, which raises questions about the
longitudinal Ampere forces being the primary cause.  It is therefore
conceivable that we are tapping a new energy source." (Of course, this
technique may not be the optimum one to extract this energy.  But it could
lead us toward a better understanding of this source.)

Professor P. T. Pappas from Greece gave an informative review of the theory
and his experiments with the creation of energy in sparks and discharges.
Pappas points out that in Maxwell's theory, it is assumed that there is
continuity and the closeness of the path for the flow of every current.  He
examines the Cardinal current force law of Ampere, and claims that energy
creation is considered as not binding, but as possible, according to this
Cardinal law as an alternative principle to the continuous creation hypothesis
of Astronomy.  Various inherent arc oscillations are presented as direct
evidence of energy creation.

Wingate Lambertson (1991) discussed the WIN Process as a solid state method
for converting zero-point energy into electrical energy that has been
developed over the past 19 years.  He places a semiconductor ceramic barrier
with a parallel capacitance between an oscillating tank circuit and a power
supply.  He has included test results that indicate a power input of 84 Watt-
sec producing an output of 810 Watt-sec, for an over-unity ratio of 9.6.

Rhetta Jacobson (1991) summarized an evaluation of Tesla Bladeless pumps and
turbines.  As these pumps use the fluid friction to operate, she finds that:
"no other pump or engine can match the longevity, economy, size, safety,
silence and vibration free performance of these devices."

While not specially related to energy conversion devices, Glen Rein (1991)
presented results of his research with cell culture bioassays and the effects
of time varying quantum potentials.  I feel this work is extremely important.
A modified caduceus coil was used to test the hypothesis that bucking
(opposite) electromagnetic fields can cancel their vector fields and generate
a time varying quantum potential (the "A field," for those in the know).
These experiments prove the existence of the "A field" that Tom Bearden and
others refer to that has been excluded from the simplified EM equations
(thanks to the simplifications of Heavyside) taught in physics today.  The
coil was shown to dramatically stimulate the growth of lymphocytes in culture
cells, both directly in proximity and indirectly through storing its
information in water.  For those in the health fields:  think very carefully
about what is being said here!  Then contact Glen!

Bruce dePalma (1991) points out that the key to understanding and explaining
the baffling situation of anomalous excess electrical energy generation in
free energy machines lies in a re-interpretation of magnetism as not being a
property of the magnet, but of space itself.  The Primordial Energy Field is
then also distorted as a consequence of the spatial reaction to the
centripetal force field existing within a ROTATING magnetized conductor.
Bruce says that a N- machine/Space Power Generator is an electrical machine
which has the capability of producing electrical energy with significantly
less mechanical power input than the presently employed induction machines.
In 1978, he constructed such a rotating device, the Sunburst machine.  In
1985, tests were performed under the direction of a well-known Professor
Emeritus of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University.  The test report
quotes:  "Known for over 150 years, the Faraday homopolar generator has been
claimed to provide a basis for so-called free energy generation, in that under
certain conditions the extraction of electrical output energy is not reflected
as a corresponding mechanical load to the driving source.  During 1985 I was
invited to test such a machine.  While it did not perform as claimed,
repeatable data showed anomalous results that did not seem to conform to
traditional theory.  ... DePalma may been right in that there is indeed a
situation here whereby energy is being obtained from a previously unknown and
unexplained source."

While my research estimates that N-machines usually report over-unity
conversion ratios of 1.00 to 1.20, Bruce reports design improvements that
could result in a machine with an output/input power ratio of 5:1.  Many
fundamental questions in electromagnetics are reopened by the implications of
the experiment with a rotating magnetic conductor.  For those interested in
delving more deeply into these questions, I recommend reading Bruce's paper,
and his paper reference's 14-18.

Tom Valone (1991) also presents theoretical and experimental data that he has
obtained with a Faraday disk, or homopolar generator.  He obtained a measured
back torque of 0.17 N-m for a 25 Watt generator which is in agreement with his
theory.  Tom is one of the few researchers who has been doing accurate
measurements on such devices within the US today.  George Hathaway (1991,
1992) is also continuing to perform various experiments in Canada.

Richard (Scott) McKie (1991) has designed and tested a small model of a PODMOD
device:  a Power On Demand MODule.  The circuitry invokes Tesla's theories of
electron flow, resonance, and magnetism, combined with modern theories on high
frequency electronics and radio antennas to generate power directly, without
the inefficient conversion of energy from other sources.  A US patent has been
filed and granted.  Scott claims to be able to generate output power as much
as 4,000 times the input power.  Prototypes have been built and tested,
including independent tests by accredited specialists.  Plans are currently
underway to build full-scale commercial PODMOD units, to be housed in standard
40 foot shipping containers, each having a continuous base-load generating
capacity of 10 megaWatts.

Don Kelly (1991) presented a very good review of the Methernitha free energy
machine, also known as the Swiss M-L Converter, or the "Thesta-Distatica."
The spiritual and communal group of Methernitha is located in Switzerland, and
a videotape might be available from Don at the Space Energy Association that
summarizes their community and shows the device in operation.  An English
transcription of that video is also available (Methernitha, 1989).  The device
contains two counterrotating disks (about two feet in diameter) that are set
in motion by hand.  They continue to spin thereafter, and the machine
generates usable power that lights or powers small tools.  The device appears
to operate continuously and generates a continuous 3 to 4 kiloWatts power at
about 220 Volts and about 10 Amps DC.  From an analysis of Wimshurst
electrostatic generators, this would require a power increase factor, or over-
unity factor of about 20.  Groups of investigative scientists from Europe and
Japan have been allowed to examine the device in the 1980s, and have all
verified these claims without understanding the machines principles of
operation (Nieper, Hans A.,1981).

Methernitha is committed to not release details on their device, as they
believe that present mankind is not ready for such advanced energy technology.
Their point of view is adequately summarized in a quote from a typed letter
from Methernitha in 1988:

"To surprise present mankind with a free-energy device would literally mean to
pour oil into a world which is already set on fire in too many places and
domains of human life.  What mankind needs is peace, peace of mind to start
with, to have a chance to find back to nature and god, and not more and
further technological support in his strife for pleasure, which would rather
drown him in an ocean of noise, over-action and pollution in general.  If you
can not accept this point of view please discover a new 'free'-energy device
by yourself.  The responsibility for its publication with all of its
consequences will then be yours only.  May peace be with you.  Methernitha

From the videotape (or the transcription published in 1989), Methernitha
states:

"This wondermachine is lurked from nature, nothing else.  Nature is the
greatest source of power as well as knowledge which man has, and it still
conceals many secrets, which are only revealed to those, who approach and tie
in them with highest respect and responsibility."  "In order to understand
nature and to perceive its voice, man is obliged to experience silence and
solitude, and it was there, where the knowledge about this technology was
obtained."  "To the educated physicist many a thing of this machine may seem
impossible, maybe even crazy.  Maybe he is also offended by the conceptions
used to explain the whole.  Only partly we could use the concepts of
conventional physical terminology in order to explain and define only
approximately the functions and properties of the various parts of the
machine."  "It has to be remembered that the established sciences were already
many times forced to change or give up some of their very fundamental
concepts.  Think about Galileo Galilei, in order to name only one example.
Our human society almost condemned this man as a sorcerer and magician, just
because he investigated and discovered a truth which seemed unacceptable by
the established science of the days."  "The book of knowledge is not wrong,
but it is incomplete, and therefore allows to draw wrong conclusions."  "We
are part of a new era which brings to light many new facts and new knowledge.
The clothes of nowaday science have become too tight and should be stripped
off, just like the larva of an insect does with its skin.  Only this will
allow a true metamorphosis to take its course, and finally, at the limits and
at the destination of all worldly knowledge, a universal and unlimited
spiritual science, radiating and beautiful, just as the completed imago of an
insect, may give its blessings and benediction to a renovated humanity."

Tom Bearden (1991) described a Vacuum Triode developed by Sweet.  I have seen
Tom's videotape of this device in operation, when it was operating.  Tom
considers the highly nonlinear nucleus of the atom as a pumped phase conjugate
mirror (PPCM).  He likens this effect to a triode tube since the amplified
phase conjugate replica of the signal wave is much like the amplified output
of a triode, and the input to a PPCM is much like a triode's grid signal
input.

Sweet has developed working devices based upon this vacuum triode concept
utilizing paired barium ferrite magnets and resonant circuits.  It should be
noted that in order for the device to work, the magnets were preconditioned by
an undisclosed process.  Devices have been reported and demonstrated to
reliable witness that have produced continuous 6, 500, and 5,000 Watts output
from a nine volt DC battery.  Through Tom's theoretical suggestions, the
circuit was modified to test possible antigravity effects.  The test results
performed by Sweet alone indicated a 90% weight reduction of the device
itself, from 6 pounds to about 20 ounces on a spring scale, when the external
load was increased from 0 to 10 Watts.  To my knowledge, no further tests have
been performed with this device, as Sweet has had severe heath and family
difficulties.

Devices Worthy of Future Study

It is difficult to separate which devices should be considered as more
important or better to research than the others listed in this paper.  All
have potential merit and application.  However;  for a first step, what is
really needed is repeatable experimental evidence of a new potential source,
to produce the so-called zero point energy, free energy, or over-unity
effects.  As funding is presently limited, the lack of resources limits our
research to simple and uncomplicated devices.  I would recommend the following
devices, in order of increasing complexity and financial commitment, as worthy
of careful attention and rapid duplication:

   Kelly's Soviet Resonant Circuit, A Computer Model and Analyses;
   Bedini Free Energy Generator (Brand new motorcycle battery);
   Hickox's Electric Dynamo (US Patent No. 4,249,096);
   Kelly's Soviet Resonant Circuit;
   Russell's Counter-wound Overlapping Conical Coil Designs;
   dePalma's and Valone's Homopolar Polar N-Machine Generator;
   Brown's Radioactive Decay Resonant Circuit (US Patent No. 4,835,433);
   Hyde's Electrostatic Energy Field Power Generating System
     (US Patent No. 4,897,592);
   Sweet's Vacuum Triode;
   McKie's PODMOD Generation Device;  and
   Methernitha's Swiss M-L Converter.

Summary

Of all of the devices reported herein, I know of none that have been
adequately tested and accepted to allow unconditional support of their claims,
nor have any of these devices been replicated or reproduced by another party
to confirm their operation.  The devices that appear most promising appear to
be held as proprietary or secretive for financial, legal, or philosophical
reasons.  This very frustrating situation is being actively overcome by the
creation of a dedicated and growing network of interested scientists and
engineers, that are providing accurate and honest information transfer,
pooling resources, and looking ahead to create, organize, and provide adequate
financial support that works.

Business Plan

What is needed is an international organization that is committed to the study
of these fields and the support of its researchers.  Such an organization
cannot survive within the United States alone.  What is proposed is a three
step plan:  (1)  The creation of an annual advanced energy conference to bring
together those who will openly discuss ideas, experiments, and devices;  (2)
The creation of an international non-profit corporation that would support
these activities and extend and network these conferences internationally;
and (3) The creation of a financial dividend structure that would allow all
participants to gain from the success of others.  Research and advancement
done at the expense of others must become a thing of the past.

Acknowledgments

I thank all of the researchers and authors that have promoted these ideas and
have placed themselves on the line in the face of so-called adversity.  I also
thank the staff and promoters of the IANS for conducting this conference, and
I thank Tom Bearden for allowing me to take his place during this conference
in his absence.  Finally, I thank myself and my higher guides for allowing me
to be able to continue to increase my consciousness, to learn to accept
knowledge without fear, and to accurately transmit that knowledge to others.

INSIGHTS INTO THE PROPRIETARY SYNDROME

By KEN MacNEILL

Cadake Industries
Winter Haven, Florida

To give you some background on myself, I have been interested in the energy
situation since I can remember.  I have built all kinds of devices, solar
energy panels, windmills, photovoltaic arrays, flywheel devices, and also
carburetors of which I will talk on Sunday.  In my background I am an
accomplished tool and diemaker, moldmaker, been involved in Design Engineering
for the past 12 years, primarily in the automation area.

My first real involvement with other people in this alternate energy area was
at the Toronto Symposium in 1981 where I met George Hathaway as well as over
100 other people that believe in the impossible according to orthodox science.
Since that time I have made myself aware of just about everything that is
happening in this field, and believe me there are some really fantastic things
going on.  The rediscovery of some of the technology that was lost in the past
is finally coming to realization, for instance the Tesla technology, the
Hubbard device, the Moray approach to tapping into the free energy supply that
we're sitting in without even knowing it.

A friend of mine gave me a real insight possibly without even knowing it.  He
said the problem could only be solved by just considering the problem of
weighing a glass of water at 500 feet under water.  Here you are under water
with a glass of water:  how do you weigh it???

The analogy is the same for us.  Here we sit in the vastness of the cosmos on
top of one of the biggest magnets known to us and we are like the glass of
water.  We are in the vast ocean of energy.  Look around us and watch just the
weather for instance, the next thunderstorm, think of all the electrical
potential being wasted.  That energy is there;  it is very real.

Tom Bearden, one of our upcoming speakers, may have illustrated it quite well
by the bird sitting on top of the wire with 13,000 volts going through it.  We
all know that it could kill him but it doesn't.  I am positive that within
this group will be the ways and means for making the energy situation of the
future change.

Now to the other side of this coin.  Why has not this technology been allowed
to become established?  We have to look at the 'profit motive' involved.  If
we have free energy, how will they charge for it?  What will happen to the
billions of dollars that the utilities and oil companies and the government
backing these establishments do if we can give the people independence from
the chains of having to pay for energy?

One question that has been uppermost in my mind for the last year has been the
rhetoric given by our elected representatives about the energy situation and
the amount of money given to small researchers who could possibly give us a
viable approach to becoming energy independent.  Who gets the government
money??  Let me get a little audience participation in the question.  How many
of you have all the money you need for research in the energy area?  Everyone
who has please stand!!!!!  Now let me mention a few of the names of the
companies that get the money.  See if you recognize them:  Exxon, Gulf Oil,
General Electric, Westinghouse, TRW, Exide Storage Battery, all manufacturers
or producers of fossil fuel products.  We need to get away from the fossil
fuels for the future and get into something that can indeed give us a future
because we are rapidly depleting not only our natural resources but our air
and water.  All because of burning fossil fuels.  We fund our universities and
colleges in the most directed of ways.  If you want to explore the
possibilities in some of the more esoteric areas, for instance the ones you
will be hearing about in the next three days, there is no money for that.
WHY???  Because of the possibility that we might succeed.  What would our
government do if all the American people could go back and forth to work, heat
their homes, run their businesses without paying taxes on gas and oil?
Consider the fact that all of the gas stations would go out of business or
would have to find other ways of making money.  Many complimentary businesses
would also fold.  But alas, this is America.  What are we here for???  To
perpetuate Big Business, Big Government, or to advance toward the future, not
expending all of our natural resources but to save them to make the goods of
the future.  Coal and oil both can be used for making all kinds of things
besides fuels;  the list is endless.

It is my feeling that the technology may be already here and may have been
shown to the government.  It even may have been introduced to our patent
office and turned down.  Because as you know, there is no such thing as a
perpetual motion device.  And I agree with the premise because forever is a
long time.

But there are surely some of the devices or parts thereof that have been
introduced to the government or to big business in the past which have been
shelved.  Tesla's transmission device is a classic illustration probably best
known to this group.  What happened is that they removed the money from him to
do his research and effectively stifled this remarkable man.  How many other
times has it happened to someone not so well known?  At this moment, there are
over 3,000 devices or applications in the patent office that have been branded
as security or put under wraps by the secrecy order, Title 35, U.S. Code
(1952) Sections 181-188.  What is security?  How is it defined?  I have had
many inventors or other scientists tell me that they did not want to discuss
their invention with me or others because they might lose it to us or we might
tell someone else before they got it onto the market.  Believe me, it won't
get there by going through the patent process.  It is my feeling that if such
a device were introduced at this level, then it would be put under the Secrecy
Act.  I don't know that I am correct in this assumption.  But I cannot imagine
a government like ours wanting to commit financial suicide.  So what better
way than to brand something as a secret?

I would like to read the Secrecy Order to you so that you may better
understand my concern.  Please pay close attention.  I think it is very
important.  To you or anyone!!!  Consider your receiving this:

SECRECY ORDER
(Title 35, United States Code (1952), sections 181-188)

NOTICE:  To the applicant above named, his heirs, and any and all of his
assignees, attorneys and agents, hereinafter designated principals:

You are hereby notified that your application as above identified has been
found to contain subject matter, the unauthorized disclosure of which might be
detrimental to the national security, and you are ordered in nowise to publish
or disclose the invention or any material information with respect thereto,
including hitherto unpublished details of the subject matter of said
application, in any way to any person not cognizant of the invention prior to
the date of the order, including any employee of the principals, but to keep
the same secret except by written consent first obtained of the Commissioner
of Patents, under the penalties of 35 U.S.C. (1952) 182, 186.

Any other application already filed or hereafter filed which contains any
significant part of the subject matter of the above identified application
falls within the scope of this order.  If such other application does not
stand under a security order, it and the common subject matter should be
brought to the attention of the Security Group, Licensing and Review, Patent
Office.

If, prior to the issuance of the secrecy order, any significant part of the
subject matter has been revealed to any person, the principals shall promptly
inform such person of the secrecy order and the penalties for improper
disclosure.  However, if such part of the subject matter was disclosed to any
person in a foreign country or foreign national in the U.S., the principals
shall not inform such person of the secrecy order, but instead shall promptly
furnish to the Commissioner of Patents the following information to the extent
not already furnished:  date of disclosure;  name and address of the
disclosee;  identification of such part;  and any authorization by a U.S.
government agency to export such part.  If the subject matter is included in
any foreign patent application, or patent, this should be identified.  The
principals shall comply with any related instructions of the Commissioner.

This order should not be construed in any way to mean that the Government has
adopted or contemplates adoption of the alleged invention disclosed in this
application;  nor is it any indication of the value of such invention.

It is my feeling that something on the order of a so-called 'free energy
device' would receive this treatment.  My only approach would be to go to the
public domain.  That is, get the information or the device out there to enough
people that they could not stop you.  This group looks like the best group to
give this information to.  Hopefully it will forthcoming in the next three
days.
