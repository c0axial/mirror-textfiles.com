BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to a motive power generating device in which
electromagnets and a combination of a magnetic material and a permanent magnet
are used as a stator and a rotator respectively.

More particularly, the invention relates to a motive power generating device
which transforms magnetic energy into operative energy with maximum efficiency
utilizing a magnetic force inherent in a permanent magnet as an energy source.

Heretofore, it has been known in the art that a motive power generating device
in which electromagnets and a combination of a magnetic material, such as soft
steel, and a permanent magnet are used as a stator and a rotator,
respectively.  Such a device includes, for example, a step motor of a HB
(Hybrid) type......
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Accordingly, it is an object of the inverntion to provide a motive power
generation device in which the occurrence of a force acting in a direction
opposite to the direction of movement of a rotor and/or a stator is prevented,
so as to permit efficient use of electric energy to be applied to
electromagnets, as well as magnetic energy generated by a permanent magnet.

In order to achieve the above object, the first invention comprises a
permanent magnet disposed around a rotational output shaft for rotation
therewith, the output shaft being mounted on a support member for rotation, a
magnetic body disposed in concentric relationship with the permanent magnet
for rotation with the rotational output shaft, the magnetic body being
subjected to the magnetic flux of the permanent magnet, a plurality of
electromagnets fixedly mounted to the support member in such a manner that
they are spaced a predetermined distance around the periphery of the magnetic
material, each magnetic circuit of the electromagnets being adapted to be
independent of one another and the excitation change-over means of the
electromagnets, the excitation change-over means being adapted to sequentially
magnetize one of the electromagnets which is positioned forwardly with regard
to a rotational direction of the rotational output shaft, so as to impart to
the electromagnet a magnetic polarity magnetically opposite to that of the
magnetic pole of the permanent magnet, whereby a magnetic flux passing through
the magnetic body converges in one direction thereby applying a rotational
torque to the rotational output shaft.

According to the first invention, when one of the electromagnets which is
positioned forwardly in the rotational direction of the rotational ouput
shaft, a magnetic field created by the excited electromagnet and a magnetic
field created by the permanent magnet interact with each other.

Thus, the magnetic flux passing through the magnetic body converges toward the
excited electromagnet, so as to rotate the rotational output shaft by a
predetermined angle toward the excited electromagnet.

When the rotational output shaft has been rotated by the predetermined angle,
the above excited electromagnet is de-magnetized, and another electromagnet
currently positioned forwardly in the rotational direction of the rotational
output shaft is excited or magnetized.

Sequential excitation of the electromagnets in the above manner permits
rotation of the output shaft in a predetermined direction.  In this regard, it
is noted that the electromagnets are excited to have a magnetic polarity
opposite to that of the magnetic pole of the permanent magnet and that the
magnetic circuit of the excited electromagnets is independent from those of
adjacent electromagnets.

Thus, the magnetic flux generated by the excited electromagnet is prevented
from passing through magnetic circuiits of adjacent electromagnets, which, if
it occurs, might cause the electromagnets to be magnetized to have the same
polarity as that of the magnetic pole of the permanent magnet.  Accordingly,
no objectionable force will be generated which might interfere with rotation
of the output shaft.

In order to achieve the above object, the second invention composes a
permanent magnet mounted on a movable body arranged movably along a linear
track, a magnetic body mounted on the permanent magnet, the magnetic body
being subjected to a magnetic flux of the permanent magnet, a plurality of
electromagnets spaced an appropriate distance along the linear track, said
electromagnets having respective magnetic circuits which are independent of
one another and excitation changeover means of the electromagnets, said
excitation change-over means being adapted to sequentially magnetize one of
the electromagnets which is positioned forwardly, with respect to the
direction of movement of the movable body, so as to impart to the excited
electromagnet a magnetic polarity opposite to that of the magnetic pole of the
permanent magnet, whereby a magnetic flux passing through the magnetic body
converges in a predetermined direction so as to cause linear movement of the
movable body.

According to the second invention, when the electromagnet positioned forwardly
of the forward end of the movable body with regard to the direction of the
movement of the movable body is excited, a magnetic field generated by the
excited electromagnet and magnetic field generated by the permanent magnet
interact with each other.

Thus, a magnetic flux passing through the magnetic body converges toward the
excited electromagnet, so as to displace the movable body a predetermined
distance toward the excited electromagnet.  When the movable body has been
moved the predetermined distance, the movable body is positioned below the
above excited electromagnet and another electromagnet is positioned forwardly
of the forward end of the movable body.

When this occurs, excitation of the electromagnet positioned above the movable
body is interrupted, and excitation of the electromagnet now positioned
forwardly of the forward end of the movable body is initiated.  Sequential
excitation of the electromagnets in the above manner permits movement of the
movable body in a predetermined direction.

It is noted that no objectionable force which would interfere with movement of
the movable body is created for the same reason as that explained in relation
to the first invention.

Kawai insists that a new form of energy has been discovered - as dohis
colleagues.  Dr. Harold Aspden of the United Kingdom writes in the November
1995 New Energy News;

  "Those skilled in the design of electric motors will soon become wizards as
   they practice the black art of producing motors which are powered by a
   ghost that pure science does not recognize.  It is no longer a question of
   whether or not a motor CAN deliver more mechanical power than it consumes
   as electricity, but rather a question of WHO WILL WIN the race to design
   THE BEST commercial implementation."
