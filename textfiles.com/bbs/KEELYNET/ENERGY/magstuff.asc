The earth's magnetosphere is, in fact, a singularity.  A large particle, as it
were.

The sun blows magnetic bubbles which remain stable for long periods of time.

Actually there is some one hundred and seventy year old mathematics (George
Green) which demonstrate the stability of these closed tubular magnetic
surfaces. More precisely these are toroidal structures.  These toroidal
structures or macroparticles along their poloidal axis create neutrons.

Yes, actually create them by topological transformations of the singularity's
field itself.  It creates little miniatures of itself (which happen to be
neutrons).  And if the magnetosphere is large enough and intense enough they
create tons per second.

As the magnetosphere orbits along the solar equatorial plane (lowest energy
state) the neutrons produced are gravitationally localized by the
macroparticle's (read magnetosphere's) gravitational field.  It is the only
thing that could keep the neutrons localized.  Next, the neutrons break down
into protons, electrons, and anti-neutrinos.  The protons are enriched in the
neutron soup to deuterium, then tritium.

The tritium by beta decay converts to He3 and the He3 gets enriched to He4 and
so on until every species of the periodic table is formed.  Eventually, the
core of the magnetosphere is enclosed by gross matter and you have the early
stage of planetary formation.  At this point it might be termed a proto-planet
or a pre-proto (or comet).  As the magnetosphere continues to produce more and
more mass the planet grows.

After a sufficiently long time one would think that the magnetosphere
(macroparticle) would be used up.  But, just as the earth's magnetosphere can
energetically couple with solar disturbances (which happen to expand the
magnetosphere into an excited state) it can be replenished.  Incidently, the
magnetosphere acts like a giant particle when excited by solar eruptions.

It expands such that radiation belts found normally at 1 radii are then found
at 8-10 radii.  Over days the magnetosphere drops back down (going through
metastable states like a particle) to its ground state.  As it does this it
also emits long wavelength photons from the poles which can have wavelengths
measured in light hours.  Of course, no one saw them.  They weren't looking
for them.  A photon at such an incomprehensible scale would sneak by as a
changing polar electric field (associated with the borealis).

We have some pretty good proof that this model is fundamentally correct.  Ball
lightning (a natural phenomenon) is a smaller more intense version of a
planetary magnetosphere.  However, experimental evidence that it creates
neutrons out of its own field structure is mounting fast.

If you can't begin to get the picture and how this will effect cosmology (as a
new theory) and physics, and eventually (trickling down) geology - then you
are not paying attention or have never been interested in the magnetosphere's
of the planets.  Look up an article in 'science news' about 18 years ago which
stated "The Sun is Forever Blowing Bubbles".

Look up another one which was titled (I think) "What was that, a comet?" Seems
the magnometers on a spacecraft flipped back and forth as the magnetic surface
of an otherwise undectable magnetosphere was passed through.  It seemed like
the bow shock of a comet but no comet was visible (and it should have been
visible).

As the magnetospheres depart the solar atmosphere they are no longer
detectable because they no longer shape or order the stellar plasma flows as
they did when they passed through it (whose photonic emissions make the
structure of the magnetosphere briefly visible).

The moon doesn't have a magnetosphere but evidence shows that it once did.
Uranus and Neptune testify that their magnetospheres are not related to the
spin of the planet, having 60 and 50 degrees (I believe) planet axis tilt with
respect to magnetic axis. And they are not in the center of the planet.

Consider Mercury which doesn't spin fast enough to generate a field but has a
healthy one anyway (which incidently is 1/3 displaced from the physical center
of the planet).  Some planets are dead, no longer growing, because their field
either completely converted into ordinary mass by neutron genesis or was
displaced from the planet by interactions with another planet's field. But at
least get this picture: "The magnetosphere is not generated by the planet but
the planet is generated by the magnetosphere."

Remember the '5th Force' geophysicists thought they found?  It was the
gravitational field associated with the macroparticle.  Each 'live' planet
(one with an active magnetosphere) has two gravitational fields associated
with it.  One associated with combined mass of the elements which comprise the
planet (gross matter) and one which is the gravitational field of the
macroparticle/magnetosphere.

We'll call the field from the macroparticle the Mag/g field and the one from
the raw mass of the planet we'll call the Mass/g field.  The Mag/g field
intensifies with depth while the Mass/g field decreases with depth.  The Mag/g
field acceleration near the planetary core can be so great that very exotic
species of elements can exist as stable elements.

For example, consider a mythical species which I shall call Isaacium which
could have 500 protons and 740 neutrons AW = 1240.  Isaacium could exist as a
totally stable element under a gravitational field that was of sufficient
intensity.

Experiments with atomic clocks in the basement and at the top of a tall
building demonstrated that the clock at the lower level ran slower than the
clock at the top.  Why? Because the acceleration due to gravity was greater
near the surface than at the top of the building.  Time dilation is not
related to the velocity of Special Relativity but rather to the acceleration
normally associated with General Relativity.

Well, in the case of the strength of the gravitational field near the core
(the Mag/g field here) the acceleration could be millions of times what it is
at the surface.  If the magnetosphere were to be suddenly displaced from the
core of the planet it is conceivable that a great deal of matter in the core
could instantly go supercritical which might actually disrupt the integrity of
the planet (blow it up) and scatter it in space.  Holy shades of asteroid
belts!

Here's the deal.  Planets grow.  Read S. Warren Carey's book: Title =
"Theories of the Earth and Universe"  {A History of Dogma in the Earth
Sciences}  Published in 1988 by Stanford Univ. Press.  Cost is about $45
U.S..

ISBN 0-8047-1364-2

S. Warren Carey is the author.  He is Professor Emeritus of Geology at the
University of Tasmania; an Honorary Life Fellow of the Geological Societies of
America, London, and Australia; and former President of the Australian and New
Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science; also Fellow of the Royal
Society, I believe.

He has been collecting the evidence for an explanding planet for longer than
many of us have been alive.

I simply have come up with a mechanism (which was developed before I heard of
Carey's work) that explains his irrefutable expansion data.  He has other
mechanisms which are somewhat plausible even though I tend to favor my own
devices (which have some experimental proof).

If you give an honest shake to Carey's work you also will come away knowing
that planets grow; and not by accretion of interstellar dust.  How anyone can
still believe that utter hogwash is beyond me.  I'm ashamed that I once
believed it.  If you are true men and women you will also be ashamed but at
once delighted that something more plausible has arrived.

Planets do grow - from the inside out!  Carey's work, among other things,
points to the geologically expressed tensional features of supposed subduction
zones. Subduction was introduced because no one could conceive of any
mechanism for planetary growth.  I urge you all to look at the evidence that
Carey and others have collected and then look into your hearts and find the
integrity necessary to no longer go along with the crowd.  You can be part of
a new paradigm that will eventually emerge with or without your assistance.

Truth is suppressible; but only for so long.  It will spring forth in the end.
If we didn't have confidence in that (as scientists) why would we even be in
science?

As I stated, there is a ton of evidence that this is true.  But there is also
a ton and one half of evidence that very few people will believe it to be true
stuck as they are in the rotten tottering paradigms of the past.  Will we, as
Max Plank indicated, have to wait until everyone of the old generation is
dead?  Will we have to wait that long?  Until a new generation comes up that
is familiar with these ideas?  Tell me it isn't true.  Are we unable to
embrace the truth?

This model has explanations for the positive correlation between earthquakes
and sunspots.  It also predicts that we have 'earthspots' where magnetic loops
exit and re-enter the surface (just like on the sun).  Problem is we can't see
the 'earthspots' because there is no plasma (excited gas state) to reveal its
existence.  Rotating 'Indian Ocean Wheel Lights' reported numerous times in
the Marine Observer and elsewhere are examples of those magnetic loops.

The changing magnetic field of an 'earth mag loop' gives rise to an electric
field which stimulates phosphorescent organisms into unique patterns of huge
rotating wheel spokes.  See Rutherford, W.; Marine Observer 30:128-129, 1960
also Pringle, J. Eliot; Nature, 20:291, 1889 also Barth, H.; Marine Observer,
24:74-75, 1954 and Hocking, R. W.; Marine Observer, 7:240, 1930.

Because 'earth mag loops' reflect a disturbance in the magnetosphere's
structure one might consider that perturbations in the macroparticle's field
could give rise to local variations in the gravitational field at depth (read
Mag/g field here). If the field at great depth over some small region were to
suddenly be diminished it could cause some volume of high 'Z' mass (mentioned
earlier and thought to normally be stable due to the intensity of the Mag/g
field at depth) to go supercritical and generate a nuclear explosion which
could be the cause of deep rooted earthquakes.

Nearer the surface we might detect earthquake lights and fast variations in
the surface field or even in the magnetic orientation of surface rocks.  This
was actually seen in California within the last ten years (surface rock
suddenly changing their magnetic orientation - associated with an earthquake).

Fast changing magnetic fields generate huge electric fields which can ionize
the air at the ground level (or higher).  Also, these fast changing fields
could also stimulate some underlying quartz bearing granitic material into
piezo-electrically induced ground motion.

I have fire extinguishers standing by (waiting for your flames).
