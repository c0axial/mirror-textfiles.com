 Dear Alain:

 I have no desire to keep these communications private. If I ever want to send
 something to you privately I will indicate it in the beginning of my text. I
 like to write these letters in Word for Windows so I can run the spelling
 checker. When I am finished I save the file to the CSERVE directory as a Text
 file with Layout. Then in WINCIM (now) I select send file from the mail menu.
 When I write an article I will upload  it  as  a  file  in  the  forum.  Your
 questions and my desire to answer them has led me to open  up  areas  my mind
 that I had  shut off for many years.  I have no problem with writing in ASCII
 format and placing my drawings as GIF files. I will work along those lines.
 Thank you for sending me the papers. I  am  digging  out the Minto Papers for
 you.

 The reason Coanda kept his formulas secret was so that he  could  profit from
 his years of  hard  work.  He had a number of companies and institutions that
 tried to use his discoveries without giving  him  credit  or remuneration. He
 earned his living from his inventions in much the same  way  that  I  earn my
 living.  I have  talked  to  David Cole about my scalar wave receivers and we
 will be testing them out on some dolphins.  I  will  keep  you informed about
 what we find.

 The Minto apparatus  was used to locate schools of fish because  the  antenna
 can be made  very directional. Two ships can therefore locate schools of fish
 by triangulating scalar wave emissions  from  the  fish. We have not idea why
 fish emit scalar  signals.  Every  type  of  fish  tested  had  a  particular
 "signature".  The scalar  signals  were all emitted in the acoustic frequency
 range. It may be that fish use these signals as a form of navigational signal
 in much the same way dolphins use acoustic search signals.

 I met Dr. Motoyama in Tokyo in 1974. He  was using a circuit that was similar
 to my first Neurophone to measure the energy of chakras. The device consisted
 of an apparatus  in which a person stands. A capacitor electrode  arrangement
 moved up and down the body. The capacitor electrodes were measuring the

                                     Page 1




 change in dielectric activity in the body at various locations.

 The chakras produce a dynamic change in the dielectric constant of the air in
 the area around the body. By measuring these changes, you can detect the
 vibration and energy  levels.   By  attaching  appropriate electronics to the
 Neurophone, we could also measure the dynamics of the chakras.

 The Neurophone circuit can be used as a scalar transmitter or receiver.
 Capacitors and the action of energy storage  in dielectrics is not understood
 by people who  work with capacitors every day in electronic  circuit  design.
 The phenomenon of   energy   storage   in   a  capacitor  is  due  to  scalar
 polarization.  The same  thing  is true  of  energy  storage  in  "space"  by
 magnetic fields. By  understanding  the  true nature of "capacitors"  we  can
 unlock the key to using scalar phenomena.

 In 1974, I   also  visited  Shinichi  Seike  who  was  working  on  "tachyon"
 transformers and other devices. The term  "tachyon"  is  simply  another buzz
 word for scalar. Seike's circuits and coil designs were all self canceling
 configurations that neutralized electric and/or magnetic fields leaving the
 scalar vector potential. The entire so-called tachyon devices that are now
 being sold are simply items that have been charged with pyramids and/or crude
 scalar devices.  That's all for now.
                                         Kindest regards, Patrick Flanagan

 Alain,

 Verrry interesting.  Really.   It's been a very long time since I worked with
 analog electronics, so I'm mighty rusty  on  self-cancelling  coil design and
 such.  I also had no idea that there was so much work going  on  in the field
 of electrical signals  generated by living bodies (and fish sounds).  I would
 like to see  a  book  or  something that  details  some  of  the  experiments
 conducted and lines  of  future  research.  I certainly don't  know  much  of
 anything about chakras (except for some mystical stuff).  As you can see, I'm
 pretty much a   neophyte  where  all  this  is  concerned.  But,  boy,  am  I
 interested.

 Dear Dr. Flanagan,

 In case you have not seen the message on the New Age Forum, here one question
 for you from  one  who  would  like to  join  the  discussion.  (Dean  Miller
 75110,3417):

 Is there any  chance  of  sharing  some  of  the  details about  your  scalar
 acoustics?  (At least, that's what I think I read.<g>)

 >> Your questions and my desire to answer them has led me to open up areas
    my mind that I had shut off for many years.<<
    We certainly  welcome  your  participation  on  this forum. You just can't
    imagine how "thirsty" we are of learning  from your lifelong experience in
    "vangard" researchs.

 >> I am digging out the Minto Papers for you.<<
    Thank you very much for your effort. I am really looking forward to learn
    more about the scalar electromagnetic effects.

 >> David Cole (about my scalar wave receivers) will be testing them out
    on some dolphins.<<
    I am so pleased to learn that you are getting all the cooperation that you
    need!

 >> Dr. Motoyama was using a circuit similar to my first Neurophone to
    measure the energy of chakras. The capacitor electrodes were measuring the
    change in dielectric activity in the body at various locations.<<
    That sounds  like  what  someone  else  was doing to detect frequencies to
    which people were "allergic" to.  In  Europe,  people  were  found  to  be
    affected by the 50 Hz of power lines, while in North America,  people were
    affected by  60  HZ  but not by 50 Hz. Have you heard of those? (I believe
    that Dr. Michrowski is quite familiar with those).

 >> By attaching appropriate electronics  to  the  Neurophone,  we  could also
    measure the dynamics of the chakras <<
    That gets complicated! What sort of changes were you detecting?

 >> Neurophone circuit  can  be  used  as  a scalar transmitter  or  receiver.
    Energy storage in capacitor is due to scalar polarization. Same thing
    for energy storage in "space" by magnetic fields. Understanding the true
    nature of "capacitors" can unlock the key to using scalar phenomena. <<
    YES! I CERTAINLY want to know about that. Please tell us more!

 >> Shinichi Seike <<
    Have you got his last edition of "Principles of Ultra-Relativity". I think
    it was published around 1990. (I have the edition prior to that one).

 >> "tachyon" is simply another buzz word for scalar. Seike's circuits and
    coil designs were all self canceling configurations <<
    It was clear that they were cancelling but I had not figured out that his
    "tachyon" buzzword was used to denote scalar properties.

 >> so-called tachyon  devices  now being sold are simply items that have been
    charged with pyramids and/or crude scalar devices.<<
    I guess you don't get as much charge  than  if  you  get  the  real scalar
    field.  I remember reading that you had published and  possibly  done some
    research on the pyramids. Can you tell us some info on that?

 (Personally, my first interest is toward the scalar stuff but there are
 people who are also interested in the other fields of "weird science").

 Dear Alain:

 1. The original  Neurophone  was  a  self-resonant  system. As the dielectric
    constant of the body/skin changes,  the  frequency  shifts. This frequency
    shift can be detected and converted into a variable voltage  that  can  be
    logged on   a   chart  recorder.  The  frequency  shift  can  be  used  as
    information. This is the principle of the Motoyama chakra detector. One of
    the things that has been reported  from  Russian  research  is that scalar
    fields alter  the  characteristics  of  insulators. These  characteristics
    include: change in dielectric constant and conductivity of the insulator.

                                     Page 3




 2. Many years  ago,  I  showed  Dr.  Walter  Stark  of  Lugano, Switzerland a
    phenomena I had discovered. If you  make  a coil of twin lead like speaker
    wire, you  have two wires side by side. The only connecting  link  is  the
    insulation between  the wires. If you connect a battery in series with one
    wire and ground and then connect the  other  wire  to an electrometer, the
    coil acts  as  a  capacitor. The electrometer will measure  the  "leakage"
    current through the insulator. The current will probably be in nanoamps.
    If you then bring the coil in the vicinity of the body, the current will
    increase by  several  orders of magnitude. This is due to the scalar field
    around the body. If the coil is placed  over  the  various chakras and the
    output of the electrometer is connected to a chart recorder  you will even
    be able to record the pulsation of each chakra.
    Dr. Stark  used my idea in the creation of an instrument that became known
    as an aura meter in Europe. It is also  known as an orgone meter. By using
    such a meter, newage scientists can learn a lot about scalar fields.
    In giving these "secrets" away, it is my intention to stimulate  research.
    It is  not my intention to hand all my secrets over on a silver platter. A
    good teacher will stimulate thinking processes.
    I have  built  all kinds of these  "aura"  or  "orgone"  meters.  You  can
    experiment with  different capacitor configurations and  dielectrics.  The
    obvious question  is  --- if you can detect scalar fields with insulators,
    can you generate these fields with insulators?  The answer is a resounding
    yes!
    This goes  back to my earlier statement that capacitors  can  be  used  to
    generate scalar   fields,  traveling  scalar  standing  waves  etc.   This
    research has been used to create many kinds of transmitter and receivers.
    The question of scalar acoustics really invloves the Neurophone.

 Dear Patrick,

 You finally landed in the Forum! Great!  We  should  soon  start  to see more
 participants into the discussion.

 >> frequency shift as principle behind Motoyama chakra detector <<
    Thanks for  the  insight  into  Motoyama's  principle. However,  on  first
    reading, it  sounds  close  to  Dr.  Hunt's  work where she used frequency
    spectrum to  detect  patterns. In  what  way  was  Motoyama's  works  very
    different from Hunt's work?

 >> Russian research in scalar fields on insulators <<
    Could you provide me with a reference paper or at least  a  scientist name
    to look for in order to find more information?

 >> coil of twin lead like speaker wire, <<
    Great! The  first thing that comes to mind is that the capacitive value of
    the body may have been a factor here. However, the pulsation pattern would
    provide a way to identify other causes.  I can just see how scientists not
    conversant with chakras and other mystical phenomena might  overlook these
    pulsations.  Was there ever something published on this?

 >> not my intention to hand all my secrets over on a silver platter. <<
    Hehehe! As  someone  said,  the  information sinks in much better when the
    student has tried to solve the problem  but  hit  a  wall! He will then be
    very receptive to a demonstration of the solution.

 >> resounding yes! <<
    That is why you say that Townsend Brown's capacitor were generating scalar
    fields in  order  to  produce  their  thrust  under  high voltage. An easy
    hypothesis from this would be that  scalar  fields  would  be  the  key to
    finding antigravity  thrust  properties. Have you done  research  in  this
    area?

 >> capacitors can be used to generate scalar fields, traveling scalar
 >> standing waves etc. <<
    I have  always  been  under  the  impression  that  standing  waves do not
    "travel".  What do you mean by "travelling  scalar standing waves" and how
    would you produce them?

 >> research has been used to create many kinds of transmitter and

    I remember  reading  in  a  patent by Gelinas that scalar  fields  have  a
    different speed than that of light and can go through media that EM fields
    can't go  through.  Have  you  done  measurements  of propagation speed of
    scalar fields?

 >> More Later. <<
 Really looking forward to this!

 Patrick,

 I very happy to see that you will be participating in the New Age forum and
 sharing some of your hard-earned experience.  I think a great deal of benefit
 for all can come of this.  I would like  very  much  to  build  a  relatively
 simple device that can demonstrate and/or measure scalar  energy.   It sounds
 as if the  device  you  described  consisting of the battery, the coil of zip
 cord (speaker wire) and the electrometer  is  just such a device.  However, I
 am having a little trouble understanding what is connected to what.

 At first I thought you were saying that on one end of the coiled zip cord the
 positive battery terminal is attached to say the ribbed conductor and the
 negative terminal is attached to the other conductor while a high impedance
 voltmeter is connected  across the conductors on the other  end  of  the  zip
 cord.  But I  think  that  that  would  only  measure battery voltage and not
 insulator leakage current.  So now I am  wondering  if  you meant to have one
 conductor of the  coiled  zip  cord  connected  to the positive  end  of  the
 battery, the other conductor at the same end of the zip cord connected to the
 positive lead of  the  voltmeter, and the remaining negative battery terminal
 connected to the negative lead of the voltmeter  leaving the other end of the
 zip cord unconnected.  Is this what you were conveying or  am  I  missing the
 boat altogether?

 I guess while you are answering questions, here are some others that occur to
 me: is a one layer coil sufficient to make a sensitive enough detector for
 chakra mapping (or  whatever)  or should the coil be multilayered?  Also, can
 the leads be allowed to twist in the coil  or  should  one be careful to keep
 the conductors always alternating?
                                                                  Jonathan

 Dear Alain,

 1. >> frequency shift as principle behind Motoyama chakra detector <<
       The Motoyama detector measures changes in dielectric field resonance in
       the space  around the body. Dr. Hunt uses direct contact EMG electrodes
       as far as I know. The Motoyama signal is due to a change in the spatial
       dielectric constant around the body as a result of the scalar potential
       variation.

                             The Sergeyev Detector

 "The electrical-field activity of excited  cells in the human organism can be
  regarded as  turbulent  low-temperature plasma that affects  the  dielectric
 properties of the environment.

 Experimental investigations of    low-temperature    plasma   structures   of
 biological origin, together with computations  performed by computer, brought
 us (Sergeyev, 1968) to the conclusion that the  energetic processes in living
 organisms are subject to the formal requirements demanded by the
 thermodynamic systems with negative temperatures.

 The Maser effects  of the living organism result in the  emission  of  highly
 concentrated streams of free electrons and protons into free space, which may
 change the local properties of the dielectric properties of the air.

 The above theoretical  prerequisites laid the foundation for the proposed new
 type of detector. The principles of operation  are based on the fixed voltage
 between two capacitive plates, separated by a dielectric with non-linear
 properties.  Polarized barium titanate crystal (BaTiO3) was used as a
 dielectric.

 The voltage of  the  output  of  a  barium  titanate  element  is  of  course
 determined by the formula:

                   4 II d E / E(p) * D1/1 (Acoustic Pressure)

                              E = 10^12 dynes/cm^2
                       d = 1.75 * 10^-6 (Young's Module)
                  E(p) = dielectric constant depending on P -
       the degree of turbulence of the plasma field of biological origin.

 The Sergyev Detector  used  barium  titanate but any insulator will do and it
 does not have to be piezo-electric!

 >> coil of twin lead like speaker wire, <<
    Nothing was ever published on this.  It  was entirely my own research. The
    first "publication" is here in the Forum.

 3. >> can you generate these fields with insulators? The answer is a

       I have succeeded in generating Gravitational Thrust  much  higher  than
       that obtained by Townsend Brown.

 4. >> capacitors can be used to generate scalar fields, traveling scalar
    >> standing waves etc. <<
       A "traveling"  standing  wave  is  generated  by causing a slight phase
       difference between two phase canceled  carriers.  By varying the phase,
       the standing wave scalar field can be caused to "walk"  or  move...  at
       least it looks like it is in motion.

 5. >> research  has  been  used  to  create  many  kinds  of  transmitter and

 Alain  : I remember reading in a patent  by Gelinas that scalar fields have a
          different speed than that of light and can go through  media that EM
          fields can't  go  through. Have you done measurements of propagation
          speed of scalar fields?
 Patrick: This is true the ability of scalar  fields  to  travel through water
          and earth  enables  these  signals  to  be  transmitted  over  great
          distances where  EM fields would be lost. They do travel faster than
          Maxwellian fields because they are not Maxwellian and obey different
          laws. I am really surprised  that  EM  signals  are  being  used for
          submarine communications because scalar waves will do the job in two
          way communications for a fraction of the cost. I think that UFO's or
          ET's communicate  with scalar signals and all the  work  being  done
          with radio telescopes will never get any results. Scalar signals may
          be used  to  modulate interdimensional or inter-galactic waves being
          generated by stellar phenomena.  Radio communications is outmoded by
          advanced technology.

 In my next communique I will give you some of the Minto details.

 Dear Jonathan,

 The Scalar Detector coil is a two wire coil such that the  two  wires are not
 in electrical contact  with  each  other. The wires act as a capacitor, being
 two parallel coils  side  by  side  with   capacitive  coupling  through  the
 insulation.  The positive terminal of the battery is attached  to  one of the
 coils and the  nagative  of  the  battery  is  attacthed  to the electrometer
 ground. The second wire coil (of the  zip  wire)  goes  to  the  input of the
 electrometer.

 The electrometer is   measuring   the  leakage  current  through   the   wire
 insulation.  All so  called  insulators are simply poor conductors,  but they
 are conductors measuring in hundreds of millions of ohms. Scalar fields alter
 the conduction characteristicas  of  insulators.   The  electrometereads  the
 change in current.

 The description I  gave you is a starting point. I have made  detectors  that
 are much better.  You  can wind parallel coils out of thing enameled wire and
 you will get better results. I used #28  wire  for  mine and my coil measures
 two inches in diameter and ten inches long. I was able to  map  chakras  with
 that coil.

    Correct. I could not see anything to the contrary. Maybe I am starting to

 >> thermodynamic systems with negative temperatures. <<
    Negative temperature?  I  guess  you  are talking about the tendency to go
    toward order rather than disorder,  and  by  extrapolation  from  entropic
    rules, you would need a negative temperature to go toward  greater  order.
    Is that what you mean?

    Hmmm! Bearden  was  saying  that  ionized  gases such as a flame, etc, are
    affected by scalar fields. I guess  that  would explain why the human body
    is so much ruled by scalar fields (as you stated it is).

 >> The Maser effects of the living organism result in the  emission of highly

 Dear Dr. Flanagan,

 In case you have not seen the message on the New Age Forum, here one question
 for you from one who would like to join the discussion. (Dean Miller
 75110,3417):

 Is there any  chance  of  sharing  some  of  the  details  about  your scalar
 acoustics?  (At least, that's what I think I read.<g>)

 >> Your questions and my desire to answer them has led me to open up areas my
    mind that I had shut off for many years.<<

                                     Page 8




    We certainly  welcome  your  participation  on  this forum. You just can't
    imagine how "thirsty" we are of learning  from your lifelong experience in
    "vangard" researchs.

 >> I am digging out the Minto Papers for you.<<
    Thank you very much for your effort. I am really looking  forward to learn
    more about the scalar electromagnetic effects.

 >> David Cole  (about  my  scalar wave receivers) will be testing them out on
    some dolphins.<<
    I am so pleased to learn that you are getting all the cooperation that you
    need!

 >> Dr. Motoyama was using a circuit similar to my first Neurophone to measure
    the energy of chakras. The capacitor  electrodes were measuring the change
    in dielectric activity in the body at various locations.<<
    That sounds  like  what  someone else was doing to detect  frequencies  to
    which people  were  "allergic"  to.  In  Europe,  people  were found to be
    affected by the 50 Hz of power lines,  while in North America, people were
    affected by 60 HZ but not by 50 Hz. Have you heard of  those?  (I  believe
    that Dr. Michrowski is quite familiar with those).

 >> By attaching  appropriate  electronics  to  the  Neurophone, we could also
    measure the dynamics of the chakras <<
    That gets complicated! What sort of changes were you detecting?

 >> Neurophone circuit can be used as a scalar transmitter or receiver. Energy
    storage in capacitor is due to scalar polarization. Same thing for energy
    storage in "space" by magnetic fields. Understanding the true nature of
    "capacitors" can unlock the key to using scalar phenomena.<<
    YES! I CERTAINLY want to know about that. Please tell us more!

 >> Shinichi Seike <<
    Have you got his last edition of "Principles of Ultra-Relativity". I think
    it was published around 1990. (I have the edition prior to that one).

 >> "tachyon" is simply another buzzword for scalar. Seike's circuits and coil
    designs were all self canceling configurations<<
    It was clear that they were cancelling but I had not figured out that his
    "tachyon" buzzword was used to denote scalar properties.

 >> so-called tachyon devices now being sold are simply items that have been
    charged with pyramids and/or crude scalar devices.<<
    I guess you don't get as much charge  than  if  you  get  the  real scalar
    field.  I remember reading that you had published and  possibly  done some
    research on the pyramids. Can you tell us some info on that?

 Dear Alain:

 I received your  package  and  would like to thank you for sending it. I have
 not completed it yet. I will comment on it after I have digested it.

 1. It reminds me of some work that was  done  at  Aberdeen Proving Grounds. I
    spent some time there in the 1960's.  They developed a  device  that  they
    called the  "Anal  Sphincter Resonator". It seems that they had discovered
    the mechanical resonance of the average anal sphincter.  There was an off-

                                     Page 9




    Broadway play in New York. It was a suspense thriller. The special effects
    man wanted to play very low musical note when danger was being acted out.
    This note  was to "shake up" the audience and lend some subliminal effect.
    The engineer made a large organ pipe out of sewer pipe. He connected a fan
    to the pipe to provide air flow.  On opening night, they had a full house.
    When the organ was switched on, the entire audience dumped in their pants.
    The show closed on opening night.  The  revue  said  that  it was a crappy
    play.  Aberdeen heard about the effect and developed a "sound cannon" that
    resonated at about 13 Hertz. They tried it and it worked.  They were going
    to use  it  for  riot  crowd control if it was ever needed. They certainly
    could have used it in Los Angeles. No  one wants to march when their pants
    are dirty.  The only problem with the machine was that the operator had to
    were diapers.  The "phased" arrays in the ADEPT seems like it would lend
    itself to producing focused sound waves in any frequency  range. Maybe one
    could be built that was directional.
 2. I have  been going through the Wallace Minto papers and they do not really
    tell how  to generate and receive  hydronic  waves.  They  do  tell  about
    experiments that prove that they are not EM waves. I am  copying  them for
    you and should get them off to you in a day or so.

 3. In the  mean-time,  I  am composing some more data for the forum.  You can
    share the Aberdeen Proving ground data with the forum if you like.

 Kindest regards, - Patrick Flanagan
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 >> Aberdeen Proving Grounds <<
    These are infrasound weapons. There are supposed to be frequencies that
    resonate your spine, some others that  create  headaches,  etc.  They  can
    hardly be attenuated by obstacle. In short, a sort of neutron  bomb. As to
    the anal sphincter resonance, I remember reading that Tesla had fabricated
    a vibration  platform  and invited VIPs for a demo. The mayor had to leave
    suddenly for a trip to the little  corner  when  Tesla  went  through this
    critical frequency in his setups. (Hehehe! re. Broadway  play,  they  must
    have been careful to choose their words to call it a crappy play!).
    I remember  reading  something  about  an  infrasound  canon being made of
    propane burners. I guess the combustion  was  interrupted  to  the desired
    frequency rate like in the pulsoreactors of the V1 (combustion is stop and
    go due to a shutter closing and opening at the front of the reactor.)

 >> focused sound waves <<
    Ziolkowski said that he had tested the result of acoustics  in water tanks
    in the  lab.  So  I would say that they are already directional. But it is
    amazing how extra dimensional variables  can  be  helpful  in  getting the
    results. It's probably why Bearden was enthusiastics with hypernumbers for
    a solution of x^2=0 with x different of zero. This sounds quite compatible
    with the scalar approach of cancelling fields.

 >> Minto papers <<
    The proof that they are not EM waves would be very handy.  As  to  how  to
    generate them,  your story of specially designed horn could point to a way
    to do it.  But it would be unsuitable  in the non-microwave region. Do you
    remember what range of frequencies Minto was using?

 >> more data for the forum <<
    Thank you very much. We are all awaiting your next brief! If you are short
    of ideas, I can prepare more questions from your write ups.

 Best regards, - Alain Beaulieu

 His reply of 20 Aug 03:20:
 Dear Alain,
                                    Page 10




 Minto used frequencies in the audio range to about 50 KHz. He told me that
 he could not generate his "hydronic" signals in the RF range.  I experimented
 first with the  audio  and ultrasonic range (these are not acoustic waves but
 are electrically generated). I then found  out the secret of the antenna that
 I mentioned earlier,  i.e. to make sure and do the opposite  of  calculations
 for EM antennas.  For  example, EM antennas are calculated for resonances but
 the hydronic antenna is out of resonance.

 The tank circuits can be resonant but the antenna is not. The hydronic or
 scalar signal amplitude is not dependent on power it is dependent on voltage.
 The higher the voltage on the antenna, the more powerful is the signal.
 J. Willard Gibbs published a mathematical treatise on a "non Maxwellian"
 signal. See:

 "The Scientific Papers of J. Willard Gibbs", Vol II, Chapter XVIII; Peter
 Smith. (Non Maxwellian transmission of energy. Now known as a scalar
 field).

 The Minto hydronics signal is an exact physical interpretation of the Gibbs
 paper. It is  amazing  that  no  one apparantly  took  Gibbs  seriously.  The
 experiment described by Gibbs works! If you cannot find it, I have the book
 somewhere in my library and can probably find it and copy it for you.

 I have been busy with business for the past few days. I have to work at least
 once a week!  We  have  installed computer language scanner  and  translation
 programs on our  computer  and  can  now  translate  Russian, German, French,
 Spanish and Italian. Chinese and Japanese  are  on  the  way.   I  have  been
 working on some data for the forum and will send it soon.

 Subj:   Hydronic Radiation (Scalar Transmission Through Air and Water)

 In the 1960's,  Wallace  Minto,  a  Florida  inventor developed an underwater
 communications technology based on what  he  called  Hydronic  and  Plasmonic
 Waves.  Using 100  mw  transistor  transmitters,  he  was  able  to  transmit
 electronic signals through  miles  of  sea-water.  The characteristics of his
 hydronic signal fits the present day description of scalar waves.

 These signals were  transmitted  instantaneously  through  water  without  an
 delay. The US Naval Research laboratory published data  on  the  velocity  of
 underwater low frequency transmission:

                        Velocity = 1525 * Sqrt Frequency

                        Velocity is in meters per second

 This means that a 6 KHz EM signal will propagate through water at a rate of

                                    Page 11




 118,000 meters per  second.  Wheras the same EM signal in air would propagate
 at 300,000,000 meters per second.

 This means that  is we were to transmit  one  signal  through  the  air,  and
 another through 100  meters of water, we should be able  to  detect  a  phase
 shift between the  two  signals. The EM signal through water would take about
 0.8 milliseconds while the air signal  would  take  .000033  milliseconds.  A
 phase shift would be easy to detect with a dual channel oscilloscope. The air
 signal was used  to trigger the A channel while the B signal  came  from  the
 scalar receiver. When  the  test  was  conducted, no phase shift was detected
 between the two signals. No test has been conducted at distances great enough
 to detect if there is a difference in transmission speed in air. Data would
 tend to indicate that scalar signals  may  travel  faster  than  EM  signals.
 Scalar signals are non Maxwellian waves and are "tensor" type signals.

 Also, the scalar signal is transmitted with virtually no attenuation.
 The attenuation for an EM signal under water is:

                         Attn (db/meter) = 0.03 Sqrt F

 Therefore, the attenuation for a 6 KHz signal at 100 meters  would be 250 db.
 The receiver had a sensitivity of 10^-9 watts. Therefore, in order to receive
 the signal, an  EM  transmitter would have to have a power of 10^16 watts, or
 more than 10,000 times the power generating capacity of the entire world.

 We were able to transmit signals at 6  KHz  and higher into the 100 KHz range
 over distances of  several  miles.  These feats are naturally  impossible  by
 means of EM signals.

 You can tell  from  the  formulas, the reason the US Government is using very
 low frequency signals in its efforts  at  transmitting  signals  through  the
 eareth's mantle to nuclear submarines. A 30 Hz EM signal would attenuate 0.16
 db per meter. The propagation velocity would be 8 Kilometers per second. With
 scalar waves, you can achieve unlimited distances and you  can communicate in
 both directions!

 Antennae:

 Scalar antennae behave  exactly  opposite  to  EM  antennae. For example, the
 dipole antenna:

 A dipole antenna receives and transmits maximally broadside to the antenna. A
 scalar signal is received and transmitted maximally in the coaxial direction,
 that is where the EM signal is at a null - off the ends of the antenna. An EM
 dipole is resonant at 1/2 wavelength for  maximum  EM signal while the dipole
 nust not be at resonance for scalar transmission.

 We are going  to  use  audio  frequencies  and very short dipoles.  Make  two
 dipoles out of  PVC  tubing. The tubing should be about six feet long. Attach
 metal plates at the end of each tube.  These  can  be  about one foot square.
 Drive the antenna  with coaxial cable in the middle.  Run  a  wire  from  the
 center of each  PVC  tub out to the metal plates.  Run the wire in the middle
 of the tubes.

 Detectors:

 Scalar detection occurs  in  a  non-linear  transistor  amplifier.  The  base
 emitter junction of  a  transistor if properly biased will  act  as  a  great
 scalar detector. The  best  transistors  for  scalar  detection  are surface-
 barrier transistors although other transistor circuits can be made to perform

                                    Page 12




 quite will. When  we are using scalar signals in the audio range, an ordinary
 audio amplifier can be modified to detect scalar signals. Minto connected his
 dipole leads directly to the base and  emitter  of the first input transistor
 of an audio amplifier.

 Transmitter:

 The transmitter can  be  a  simple  modulated  audio oscillator.  The  output
 voltage should be  as  high as possible. (in air, this is no problem) You can
 use a power audio amplifier as a transmitter  and  drive it with a pure audio
 tone to run  your  tests. Connect the speaker output of the  amplifier  to  a
 vacuum tube audio output transformer.  Get one that has an impedence ratio of
 4 ohms to 16,000 ohm sor higher. Connect the output transformer so that the 4
 ohm coil is  connected  to the speaker output terminal. The high voltage side
 of the transofrmer will connect to the transmitting dipole.

 The output signal is a funtion of voltage  and  not  current.  The higher the
 voltage, the stronger  the  scalar  signal. In a EM dipole  transmitter,  the
 energy is transferred  in  the form of current. The scalar system is just the
 opposite.

 The setup I am describing is for air to air transmission. The water and earth
 system require different parameters. This is just to get you started.

 After for successfully detect the signal,  you  can experiment with different
 input circuits to maximize detection. Most commercial audio  amplifiers  have
 sufficient non-linearity to detect the scalar signal from the transmitter.

 Meter:

 You can measure  field strenght at the receiver by connecting a Digital Meter
 accross the output of the amplifier. You  will also want to connect a speaker
 or headphones to the oputput so you can monitor the signal acosutically.

 If you take your receiver down to the ocean and aim the dipole  at  the water
 like a rifle,  you  will  be  able  to detect signals from fish if you use an
 audio amplifier as a receiver. Use headphones.

 Well, that's it for now. The experiments I have described are in introduction
 into scalar communications. We have developed  this system so that it is very
 sophisticated and can generate and receive these siognals  in  virtually  any
 frequency range.

 Let me know how you make out.

    Thanks for  the  hints!  About  the  surface  barrier  transistors, I just
    watched a  4 hour videotape on the  Montauk  project  also  known  as  the
    Philadelphia Experiment revisited. At the end, Preston Nichols goes into a
    "mathematical frenzy"  to  explain  how  the  USS  Eldridge  was  made  to
    disappear. He  explained that the universe was really a torus. The rate of
    time is the motion of the 3-D world along the torus but the time itself is
    a twistor around it which results into  a  helicoidal path around the ring
    of the torus. In short, we live in a 5-D world of which 3 dimensions are

                                    Page 13




    space and  2 dimensions are time. If you can get phased out of the twistor
    time, you can be made to disappear.  He  explained  that  you  needed  SBT
    transistors for  that and that the US Navy was preventing  the  public  of
    having access  to those. It would appear that it is what makes the Stealth
    fighters real stealthy (i.e. one step further than Electronic Warfare).

    Now, in the video, he says that he  found  a  batch of 40,000 of them that
    were sold by Radio Shack and bought them all because  they  are  not  made
    anymore. So  my  question  to you is: Do you know of part nos for SBT that
    are available commercially, and if not available, what olther alternatives
    are there?

    In spite of VERY wild claims in it,  the Montauk story has a ring of truth
    to it so I would certainly enjoy it if you could vision  it and provide us
    with your  comments.  The  tape  is  #610217  and  is  titled  "Conference
    Workshop: Delta t Generator & the Philadelphia  Experiment"  by Al Bielek.
    It sells for $39.95 from The International Tesla Society. It starts by the
    story of  Tesla  (first  1.5  hour)  and then goes into  the  philadelphia
    experiment background (Einstein, Von Neumann, Tesla, etc, and the Advanced
    Study Institute  in  Princeton).  They  also  have  the  book "The Montauk
    Project: Experiment in Time" by Preston  B.   Nichols,  1992,  Sky  Books,

 >> What's a good book to read to get a very basic introduction to what

    That's the problem: there is no one good book. But the  best one I've seen
    is Bearden's  book  titles:  "AIDS:  Biological  Warfare".  I think it was
    chapter 4  which was subtitled Extraordinary  Physics.  Bearden  keeps  it
    mysterious because of non-disclosure agreements that he  had  to sign with
    some researchers but it is a very good start.
