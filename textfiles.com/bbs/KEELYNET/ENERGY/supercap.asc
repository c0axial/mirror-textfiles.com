       Greetz,

       Here's one from  a friend that I met in RURAL Tennessee: When he was
       a kid he and his brother wrapped a HUGE 12" dia.x 12" long condenser
       made of wax paper and aluminum foil.

       He said that they lost interest in  it  and  left  it outside in the
       garage for a week or so and then one of them picked it up to move it
       and was knocked  out  after  hearing  a loud CRACK  sound.  Is  this
       possible?

       Could a capacitor  of  this size accumulate energy without any other
       components? Or could they have accidently  wound  exactly  a certain
       size unit to make this happen?

       It would be nice if this really would be a starting  point  for some
       type of "free energy accumulator"...

       Curiously..this same fellow  and his brother were possibly the first
       to build an induction heated hot dog  cooker using a couple of nails
       on a piece of wood connected to the mains by and old extension cord.
       When you plug each end of the hot dog into the nails and plug it in,
       you've got a HOT hot dog.

       They were later  conned  into signing over the rights  to  the  idea
       before they realized  it  was  worth anything other than a grade for
       their science class..same old story huh?

       Thanx for any ideas regarding this "SUPER CAPACITOR"........
