                A Short Treatise on Alpha, Beta, Gamma Ray Therapy

                             by Dr. Henry Moray - 1946

       Science acknowledges that  bombardment  of  matter  by  swift moving
       alpha particles has proven a powerful  method of studying ARTIFICIAL
       TRANSFORMATION of the nucleii of a number of the ordinary  elements.
       Evidence is also  accumulating  that  by  this method we are able to
       cause a disintegration of a nucleus  of  greater  mass by capture of
       the colliding alpha particle.

       The above law applied to therapy and other scientific  investigation
       is not beyond  possibility.   Through  the treatment of the cells of
       the human body ARTIFICIAL TRANSFORMATION  or DISINTEGRATION may take
       place.

       The DISINTEGRATION of FUNGI and CELLS GONE WILD in  the  body  is of
       value in therapy.   Nature  can then rebuild with new healthy tissue
       and cells.  That is what is attempted  in  Radium  and X-ray therapy
       and would be accomplished if it were not for the DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS
       of radium and  the  fast moving alpha rays as also  gamma  rays  and
       treatment by beta  rays  (which  are  electrical  in Nature) one can
       obtain beneficial effects in many cases.

       Valuable results can be had in therapy  on  living cells IF there is
       no destruction of cells or tissue in trying to effect a cure.

       Because the fundamental radioactive process DOES  NOT  ORIGINATE  in
       the ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE  of  the  SURFACE  OF  THE ATOM, but IN THE
       CENTER OF THE ATOM, deep therapy is  possible  over a long period of
       time with the Moray CosRay applicators.

       It is an accepted fact that the length of day and  night  is  a very
       important factor in  the growth and development of most plants.  The
       more sensitive plants normally attain  their  flowering and fruiting
       stages ONLY when the length of day falls within certain limits.

       Some respond to a long day while others respond to a short day. That
       is why we  have  early  and late maturing species depending  on  the
       length of day to which they are exposed.

       Animal cells react  also  to light rays and to rays BEYOND the light
       rays.  In this fact we have the basis for light and ray therapy in

                                      Page 1





       the treatment of human tissue and cells, the biological effects from
       radiations to both animal and vegetable cells.

       There are also effects from RADIATIONS ON MINERAL MATTER.

       Radiations effect pigments, bacteria, fungi and enzymes.  Radiations
       INDUCE CHROMOSOMAL ABERRATIONS  in  animals.   One  will find a real
       field for therapy advancement in the  study of radiation absorptions
       of tissues and the study of mutations in animal matter.

       Modern living away from natural radiations, because  one  is indoors
       so much of  the  time  away  from  natural  radiations, necessitates
       ARTIFICIALLY supplying various rays.

       In ray therapy, the problem is generally  that  of treating diseased
       tissues BELOW the  skin.  There are two important  problems:  First,
       how to effect  relief  without injury to the skin, healthy cells and
       intervening tissues.  Second, how  to  measure  correctly  the depth
       dose delivered to the diseased tissue.

       With the Moray  CosRay  applicator  one  may  disregard  the  second
       problem because the  problem  does not exist with these applicators.
       The first problem is a question  of  time  as  the  rays  from these
       applicators will penetrate through the human body (proven  by Geiger
       Muller Counter tests).

       These applicators' rays  will  also  penetrate 1/2 inch thickness of
       lead.  The above is given to show  the penetrating power of the rays
       from these applicators, and yet they will not injure healthy tissues
       because of the  INTERNAL  PHANTOM CHARACTERISTICS built  into  these
       applicators as a  PATENTED  FEATURE,  and  the  nature of the ACTIVE
       MATERIAL used.

       The value in therapy of Alpha, Beta and especially Gamma rays in the
       treatment of epithelial cells and  malignancy  is  too well known to
       take the time and space here to go into the subject.

       However, their destructive qualities have been their great drawback,
       destroying the healthy surrounding tissue while treatment  is  being
       made of the ailing cells and tissue.

       No special shielding  protection  is necessary with the Moray CosRay
       applicators.  These applicators may  be had in any shape and size to
       best conform to the application to which they are to be put.

       Too little attention has been paid to the therapeutic  value of BETA
       RAYS.  In most  cases  great care has been used to filter these out.
       The Moray method, by proper application,  MAKES USE in some cases of
       these Beta rays to the value of the tissue under treatment.

       In all forms of gamma ray therapy, doses are expressed  in Roentgens
       or "R".  In  other  words, the QUANTITY OF GAMMA RADIATIONS received
       in one hour at a distance of one  CM.  from  a  source  containing 1
       milligram of radium in a 0.5 MM. platinum envelope  may  be regarded
       as approximately eight roentgens, or eight "R"s.

       Such procedure means  the  application  of such therapy requires the
       close supervision of an expert.  With  the  Moray CosRay applicators
       no close supervision is necessary as these applicators are not so

                                      Page 2





       severe in their reaction, yet they have deep penetrating properties,
       as explained, and  ray  therapy  value  without  the  danger  to the
       surrounding tissue.

       It has been  the  purpose of this  leaflet  to  explain  in  a  non-
       technical way a  little of the science of radioactive  phenomena  so
       that users and  prospective  users  of  Moray CosRay ray applicators
       (CosRay being a trademark name)  will  have  some  idea  of the rays
       these applicators give off.

       In the DISINTEGRATION OF THESE APPLICATORS, ALPA,  BETA,  AND  GAMMA
       RAYS ARE EMITTED.   The alpha and beta emanations are really CHARGED
       PARTICLES, since they  may  be  actuated   (deflected)  by  electric
       fields.

       Gamma rays, like heat, light and X-rays are electromagnetic waves.

       Alpha particles are  positively  charged HELIUM ATOMS,  but  possess
       much greater energies than the ordinary positive particles.

       Beta particles are  the same cathode particles or are ELECTRONS, but
       are much more active, having the HIGHEST VELOCITIES OF ANY SUBSTANCE
       KNOWN.

       The half life of these CosRay applicators  is  about  1600 years, so
       one can see   they   will  be  of  therapy  value  through   several
       generations of mankind  in  the  treatment  of  epithelial cells and
       malignancy where heretofore  Radium   and   X-rays   have  been  the
       recommended treatment.

       These applicators are the discovery and invention of John Eugene and
       Richard R. Moray.   For further information write,  CosRay  Research
       Institute, Salt Lake City 5, Utah.

       Vangard note...

           This sounds  more  like  a  handout for selling a machine and in
           fact it is.  Only this was done in 1946 and the machines are now
           illegal due to the radioactive  nature.  There is a patent which
           is available through the patent office.

           The depth of the information in the paper is not  normally worth
           placing it  on  KeelyNet.   HOWEVER, it is well known that Moray
           used radioactive materials in his work which caused his hands to
           break out with cancerous ulcers.

           His method  of treatment was probably  the  CosRay  applicators,
           although we understand Moray also used the term  "peach  blossom
           violet" in describing the color of ray which he used to heal his
           cancers.

           Our investigation  into the nature of this "peach blossom violet
           ray" matter finds close correlation  with  several other sources
           specifically in regard to this color of light :

       Correlate 1

           The Priore device was said to emit a violet or magenta light and

                                      Page 3





           was inspired  by  observing  that fruit bathed in a violet light
           DID NOT DECAY.  (refer PRIORE1 on KeelyNet)

       Correlate 2

           The work of Dinshah Ghadiali in  his development of the Spectro-
           Chrome system of light therapy.  Dinshah indicates that a violet
           or magenta  light  had  restorative  properties.    (nothing  on
           KeelyNet at of yet on this work)

       Correlate 3

           Violet and  UV  radiations  are  known  to influence tissues for
           destruction and/or enhancement of the transcription process.

           In addition, Ozone generating  devices such as the Master Violet
           Ray and other "blacklight" devices are known to  have beneficial
           effects on the body.

           Of course, we know that UV has ionizing properties which in turn
           increases the  release  of  atomic  oxygen  in  the  body  (free
           radicals).  These are quite biologically active and are believed
           to have  radical  healing  (as  well  as  damaging)  properties.
           (refer AGE5 on KeelyNet)

           A main group involved in collecting and correlating  data on the
           effects of  oxygenation  therapies  is  IBOM (International Bio-
           Oxidative Medical Foundation) located in Fort Worth, Texas.
