This is an interesting thread -- with an interesting twist.

I published a book in 1976 [ modestly :-)  ] entitled Relativity Beyond
Einstein that contained my Dual Velocity Theory of Relativity.

In it I maintained that a better relativity theory could be had by
generalizing Newtonian mechanics (I termed it "creating a bridge between NM
and relativistic mechanics").

Actually, in the beginning, I thought I was going to come up with something
very different than Einstein's SR. As things went along I began to see that I
was developing a parallel theory. Certain reviewers were telling me that I was
saying the same thing in a different way.

But when I finished there were certain differences. For example, in SR we have
the concept of "relativistic mass" that creates quite a bit of controversy and
"un-understanding" -- or *mis*understanding if you please, to wit:

               Momentum is given as P = gamma m, which is often written

                                         mv
                                    P = ----
                                          R
    (R = Lorentz transformation)

It is always assumed that R modifies m, creating the unexplainable -- often
causing problems -- 'relativistic mass'.

As an inherent part of my theory R modifies v (velocity), not m (mass). This
gives us an INVARIANT mass.

But what about the velocity? It is measured as v. The theory is based on
Newtonian velocites with infinity as a limit -- BUT there are *two* velocites,
the c+ velocity is foreshortened in observation and is measured as v.

There is a *mechanical* explanation for this phenomenon.

The theory also reveals a differing Doppler effect (see posting this
newsgroup), a differing addition of velocities (also in this newsgroup) and a
differing rate for time dilation (and compression). The latter dissipates the
twins paradox.

I could go on -- but then I'd be long winded. Just wanted to get my 2 cents in
here.

A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making
them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new
generation grows up that is familiar with it.

Vanguard Note  -  Looking for more details on this theory.  How intriguing,
that mass does not change, just the speed at which the mass is moving, kind of
a turbo boost once the Lorentz transformation kicks in.  Could this be a key
to how to generate the 'wormholes' so prevalent in sci-fi media today?..Jerry
