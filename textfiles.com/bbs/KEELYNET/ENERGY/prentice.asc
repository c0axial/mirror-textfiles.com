  Below is the patent of Frank Wyatt Prentice.  This patent is similar to the
  "one mile wire  experiment"  (see  AETHRTAP.ASC  file  on   Keelynet  BBS).
  Apparently, the number  of  the  patent seems to be wrong.  Sorry for this;
  the first page of my copy in front of me refers to this number (US patent).
  Where is the bug?...

  Anyway, here is the transcript of this  patent.  You will find the drawings
  in the PRENTICE.GIF   file.   If  you  experiment  something   with   these
  informations, let me know your results! (on Keelynet BBS).

  TO ALL WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
  ---------------------------
  Be it know  that  I, FRANK WYATT PRENTICE, of the City of Meadville, County
  of Crawford, State of Pennsylvania, Electrical  Engineer,  having  invented
  new and useful  improvements  in  ELECTRICAL POWER ACCUMULATORS  do  hereby
  declare that the  following  is  a full, clear and exact description of the
  same;

  My invention relates to improvements  in  ELECTRICAL POWER ACCUMULATORS and
  like, wherein the  earth  acting  as  rotor and the surrounding  air  as  a
  stator, collects the  energy  thus  generated  by the earth rotating on its
  axis, utilises the same for power and other purposes.

  In the development  of  my  WIRELESS TRAIN  CONTROL  SYSTEM  for  railways,
  covered by my  United  States Letters Patent Number 843,550,  I  discovered
  that with an antennae consisting of one wire of suitable diameter supported
  by insulating means  three to six inches above the ground and extending one
  half mile, more or less in length, the said antennae being grounded at one

                                     Page 1





  end through a spark gap and energized at the other end by a high frequency
  generator of 500  WATTS  INPUT  and having a secondary frequency of 500,000
  would produce in said antennae oscillatory  frequency  the  same as that of
  the earth currents and thus electrical power

                           FROM THE SURROUNDING MEDIA

  was accumulated along the length of the transmission antennae  and  with  a
  closed oscillatory loop  antennae  18  feet in length run parallel with the
  transmission antennae at  a  distance  of  approximately  20  feet  it  was
  possible to obtain by tuning the loop antennae,

                SUFFICIENT POWER TO LIGHT TO FULL CANDLE POWER A
                   SERIES BANK OF 50 SIXTY WATT CARBON LAMPS.

  Lowering or raising  the frequency of 500,000 cps resulted  in  diminishing
  the amount of  power  received  on  the  18  foot  antennae.  Like-wise the
  raising of the transmission antennae  resulted  in a proportionate decrease
  of power picked up on the receiving antennae and at 6 feet  above the earth
  no power what-ever  was  obtainable  without  a  change  of  potential  and
  frequency.

  It is the objective of my generic invention  to utilize the power generated
  by the earth  by means herein described and illustrated  in  the  drawings.
  The two figures  in  the  drawings illustrate simple and preferred forms of
  this invention, but I wish in understood  that no limitation is necessarily
  made as to  the  exact  and  precise  circuits,  shapes,   positions,   and
  structural details therein   shown,   exhibited  and  herein  described  in
  combination or otherwise and that changes,  alterations  and  modifications
  may be made  when  desired  within  the  scope  of  my  invention   and  as
  specifically pointed out in the claims.

  OPERATION OF THE INVENTION:
  ---------------------------
  Having described the  drawings  will  now  describe  the  operation  of  my
  invention.

  Throw switch 3 connecting feed wires  1  and 2 with transformer leads 6 and
  7, adjust spark gap 10 and condensr 11 so that a frequency  of  500,000 and
  100,000 volts is  delivered  from  secondary  leads  14  and  15 of step up
  transformer 8 of Figure 1.

  Next adjust spark gap 21 of transmission  antennae 14 so that all nodes and
  peaks are eliminated in the transmission of the 100,000  volts  and 500,000
  frequency along said antennae 14, by the surges occurring pass over the gap
  21 to lead  22  to  adjustable condenser 23 to lead 24 to ground 24' thence
  the high frequency current of 500,000  passes  in  return through ground to
  ground 18 tence  up  lead  17 to adjustable condenser  16  to  lead  15  to
  secondary winding 13 of transformer 8.

  The oscillatory current  of  100,000  and frequency of 500,000 being of the
  same frequency as the earth generated  currents  and thus in tune with same
  it naturally follows   that  accumulation  of  the  earth   currents   will
  ASSIMILATE WITH THE  SAME  TUNED  CIRCUITS  and frequency with those of the
  output from transformer 8 along wires  14  affording  a  reservoir  of high
  frequency currents to  be  drawn upon by a tuned circuit  HAVING  THE  SAME
  CHARACTERISTICS of 500,000 frequency capacity which is shown in Figure 2.

  The antennae 25  is  tuned  fundamentally to receive a frequency of 500,000
  which current passes  to lead 26 through  winidng  27'  of  transformer  27
  thence to lead wire 28 through adjustable condenser 29  to  lead wire 30 to
  ground 31.

  The high frequency currents of 500,000 and voltae of 100,000 passes through
  to winding 32  and by adjustable condenser 33 and windings 34 and 35 of the
  frequency transformer 27  is  stepped  down  to  a  voltage  and  frequency
  suitable to operate motor 38 receiving current from leads  36 and 37.  This
  makes available a  current  supply  for  any  purpose  what  ever,  such as
  operation of areoplanes,  automobiles,   railway  trains  and  current  for
  industrial plants, lighting, heating and etc...

  The return of current through the earth from transmission  antennae  14  is
  preferable to a  metallic  return as a higher percentage of accumulation of
  earth currents is noticeable on receiving  antennae of Figure 2 than from a
  metallic return accountable  for  because  of  the  condenser   effect  the
  grounded circuit affords.   I also prefer under certain conditions to use a
  single antennae receiving wire in place  of the closed loop shown in Figure
  2.

  Under certain operation requirements I have found it expedient  to have the
  transmission antennae elevated  and  carried  on  poles many feet above the
  earth and in that case a DIFFERENT voltage and frequency WAS NECESSARY

  Vangard Note

     We should all applaud Louis for this magnificent file.  At the last ISNE
     conference, a  private  conversation  with an old friend brought up this
     story which is related in the file  AETHRTAP.ASC.   Louis  took the file
     down, made the correlation with Prentice out of his  library,  typed  it
     up, drew in the diagram and sent it to us to share with everyone here.

     This is  the  kind  of effort and thoughtfulness that we really must all
     appreciate and copy wherever we can.   Once  it  is  in digital form, it
     benefits UNTOLD other researchers who might not have  ever  heard of it.
