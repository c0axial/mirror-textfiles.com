       Dear Jon:

            Thanks for sending along the extract of comments on the papers.
       Perhaps I can add a thing or two that will shed a little  more light
       on some of  this.  First, let's settle the matter of whether this is
       a scam by persons after money.  It  isn't. There are no stock plans.
       Nobody wants any "investment."  No one would accept  it  if  it were
       offered.  The inventor  presently  has a sufficient small income for
       his small needs.  I work every day as a senior engineer, and support
       myself adequately in that fashion.   I'm  also retired from the U.S.
       Army with the  rank of Lieutenant Colonel.  Also,  it  is  certainly
       quite true that  the  burden  of  proof  is fully upon Sweet and me.
       That proof can   only   be  achieved   by   independent   test   and
       certification by agencies  and scientists of impeccable  credentials
       and with no  formal  connection to the project.  Until that is done,
       we totally accept that what we have  said  will not be believed, and
       should not be believed.  I will say this:  I have absolutely no


                                      Page 1





       control of the  invention,  and  absolutely no say in its direction.
       It is totally Sweet's invention.

            If I  had  had  my  own fervent  wish,  formal  submission  for
       independent testing and  certification  (or  falsification)  by  the
       scientific community would  have  been accomplished in 1987.  Let it
       also be noted that an inventor has  agreements  and/or  (with other)
       parties involved; he is often not legally free to do  exactly  as he
       might wish.  The  best we can presently ask is that the readers keep
       an open but   highly  skeptical   mind,   until   such   independent
       certification is forthcoming.  If it isn't forthcoming,  then  trash
       the whole thing in file 13.

            To try  to  address the gist of many of the other comments, let
       me point out that we are referring  to  two key mathematical papers:
       Whittaker 1903 as cited, and Whittaker 1904 as cited.   Let  me urge
       all persons who  commented  on  the lack of mathematics to please at
       least study those two papers intensely.   Let me summarize what they
       actually show, rigorously.

            In the  first paper, Whittaker shows that, completely  at  odds
       with the present scientific view, the electrostatic scalar potential
       has a totally  unsuspected  and  highly  organized  bidirectional EM
       internal structure.   It's actually  composed  of  paired  EM waves,
       each going in  opposite directions (and in my view,  one  being  the
       phase conjugate of  the  other).    Further, the bidirectional pairs
       are phaselocked and in a harmonic  sequence.   So what the potential
       is actually composed  of  is  a  Fourier-type  harmonic   expansion,
       directly coupled with  its  time-reversed  twin set, in a one-to-one
       ratio, with all the harmonic twin waves phase-locked.

            Normally, in electromagnetics one just gives a magnitude to the
       potential at each point and leaves  it  at that.  However, Whittaker
       shows that the   potential  at  a  point  actually   encompasses   a
       magnificent, hidden, highly  organized  flow  of EM waves and energy
       into and out  of  that point.  Although  there  may  be  no  net  EM
       forcefield at the point, the "hidden interior" energy  flow  through
       the point to and from the surrounding space is filled with EM forces
       and waves in dynamic motion.

            This leads to a real quandary in the assumed nature of a scalar
       potential, in my  view:  Instead of being a passive or simple scalar
       sort of thing that just has a convolution magnitude and sometimes an
       external gradient in that magnitude,  it's a new kind of entity that
       is scalar externally,  with  gradients  between  adjacent   external
       points, but at  the  same  time it's totally dynamic, vectorial, and
       energetically organized "inside."

            "Further, it  would  seem  to  be  in  hidden  hyperspatial  EM
       communication with every other point in the universe,  at  least  in
       the simple case.   The basic thing, I think, is that Whittaker seems
       to delocalize the  notion  of  the   potential,  extending  it  into
       hyperspace with respect to its internal EM energy flow.   If someone
       on the net  could  put  that into more precise language, I'd be very
       grateful.

            In my picture of it, as shown  by Whittaker the seemingly quite
       placid scalar potential is an unsuspecting vector EM  dynamo inside.
       In early 1987 I simply took the Whittaker picture of the potential's

                                      Page 2





       internal bidirectional EM  waves  seriously, and realized that these
       internal hidden EM waves didn't translate  electrons in the electron
       shells of atoms,  but  instead  penetrated to the nucleus  directly.
       That meant that,  in  simply  having  a  stress potential added to a
       material, one effectively had "pumping"  EM waves connected directly
       to the atomic  nuclei  through  hyperspace, bypassing  the  electron
       shells' usual Faraday shielding interaction.

            One can  fairly  readily  build  EM  wave oppositions in proper
       harmonic, phase-locked Whittaker  fashion,  and  so one can make and
       use an EM   gradient-free   potential   construction   entirely   of
       bidirectional waves.  This construction is such that :

            (1)  a  normal electron-wiggle detector instrument doesn't even
                 "see" it,
            (2)  the internal wave EM reaches  directly  to the nucleus and
                 affects it and
            (3)  it  consists  of  EM "pump" waves in the  nonlinear  phase
                 conjugate mirror sense.

       All that was  needed  then was to simply extract the standard pumped
       phase conjugate mirror equations  from  nonlinear  optics  and apply
       them to this "potentialized" or "Whittaker-pumped"  nucleus  of  the
       atom.  That mean  that  the  nucleus  should  now  be a pumped phase
       conjugate mirror.  However, it still needs one small thing
       added.  Sweet did one additional thing:

                he superposed a 60-Hz modulation  on  the  envelope  of the
                Whittaker bidirectional waveset.

       In other words,   the   external   amplitude  of  the   artificially
       constructed stress potential  was  oscillated  at 60 Hz.  [Note that
       the external amplitude of the potential  is  what is in our 3-space;
       the internal Whittaker EM biwaves are BEYOND 3-space. The nucleus is
       a hyperspatial or  higher  topological  entity  when  the  Whittaker
       structures of its potentials are taken into account.]

            Sweet personally  discovered the activation procedure (which he
       still holds proprietary) for causing  this  60-Hz  oscillation to be
       taken up and self-sustained by the barium nucleus  (we  assume  that
       it's the barium  nucleus  involved,  because  it won't work with any
       other kind of  magnet  except  a  barium   ferrite  magnet).   Self-
       oscillation of barium compounds is well-known in the phase conjugate
       mirror optical literature.  However, most of the  papers  I've  been
       able to find  on self-pumping mirrors have achieved the self-pumping
       only at optical frequencies.

            I've not  been  able  to  find   anything  else  at  ELF  self-
       oscillation frequencies.  I will say that, if Sweet's  6-lb  unit is
       not in the  self-oscillation (activated, or self-pumping) condition,
       you won't get a microwatt out of it, no matter what you do!  If it's
       in the self-oscillation  condition   but   at  essentially  "normal"
       nuclear potential, you will only get a few watts out, say, something
       like six watts.

            Sweet increased   the   nuclear   potential   and   its   60-Hz
       oscillation, trapping it  in  the barium nucleus also as part of the
       activation, whereupon much greater  electrical  power is extractable
       from the device.   He also worked out the device design so that its

                                      Page 3





       objective output voltage  was  120 volts, for an input voltage of 10
       volts (at 33  microamps).  This small  1/3  milliwatt  60  Hz  input
       corresponds to the signal wave in PPCM theory.

            The entire  device  is, in my view, just a special  self-pumped
       phase conjugate mirror,  precisely  like  what  is  already  in  the
       standard literature, self-pumping and all.  It's just self-pumped at
       ELF frequencies, and in a very special  manner.   It is being fed by
       self-oscillating hidden EM  biwave (pumpwave) energy  directly  from
       the surrounding vacuum.     [The    EM    energy   of   the   vacuum
       intercommunicates internally through   the   hyperspatial  Whittaker
       channels of the  vacuum.   The  gradient in the potential  magnitude
       represents the EM  energy  entering  our  3-space  by  local  scalar
       interferometry.]

            I also quoted a reference that  shows  that  the  local  vacuum
       immediately around a nucleus is structured by the nucleus and can be
       considered and treated as a special sort of semiconductor.   One can
       visualize, then, that  the 60-Hz trapped self-oscillation is between
       that local semiconductor  vacuum   and   the   potentialized  barium
       nucleus. In other words, in the self-oscillating nuclear  potential,
       it is both the local vacuum and the nucleus that are oscillating, at
       180 degrees phase  from  each  other.   That  means  that there is a
       rhythmic inflow and  outflow  of   potential   (Whittaker   biwaves)
       envelope magnitude gradient, to and from the nucleus,  exchanged  to
       and from the  local  semiconductor  vacuum.  Note what we're talking
       about.

            You've got to get the hyperspatial  EM  energy  exchange of the
       vacuum "gated" or"  shifted"  into  our  3-space,  from  hyperspace.
       Whittaker's 1904 paper  can  be  interpreted as showing that (1) the
       gradient in the potential represents the 3-space aspect, and (2) any
       such potential gradient   in   3-space   is   produced   by   scalar
       interferometry (interference of  the  hyperspatial  vector  EM  wave
       interiors of scalar potentials.)

            So Sweet's   60-Hz   modulation   of  the  nuclear  potential's
       amplitude represents a 3-space oscillating flow of EM vector energy,
       in and out of the nucleus from the surrounding semiconductor vacuum.
       If you properly introduce a signal wave to that "activated" or self-
       pumped nucleus (once it's got a 3-space oscillating EM vector flow),
       then by standard textbook theory you  are going to get out up to all
       the energy in the pump waves, coming forth from the "nucleus-mirror"
       as an amplified phase conjugate replica (PCR) of  the  small  signal
       wave input.

            By the  standard distortion correction theorem,  that amplified
       PCR wave will travel back along the  path  taken by the signal wave.
       In other words,  you've got organized EM energy coming  out  of  the
       nuclei as a  coherent EM wave, through the electron shells, into the
       material lattice, and on out of there into the external circuit.  At
       that point, one simply taps onto it  (e.g.,  by magnetic induction),
       and you can extract and gate the amplified energy wherever  you wish
       in the external  circuit.   Note  that  the  60-Hz  self-oscillation
       energy comes in from the local vacuum  to the nucleus, on the inflow
       or "intake" cycle.   If you gate some of it on out  of  the  nucleus
       externally, instead of   letting   it   flow   back   to  the  local
       semiconductor vacuum, the   adjacent    vacuum    surrounding    the
       semiconductor just promptly replenishes the local vacuum potential.

                                      Page 4





       It has to do so, because of the nonlocal hyperspatial EM energy flow
       in the Whittaker structure of the potential in the first place.  You
       can draw EM  energy  out of those internal EM waves in the Whittaker
       structure of the potential, and the  electrical charges establishing
       that potential will  continue  to  "pump  out" virtual  photons  and
       replenish the potential.

            It can  be  seen  that  the potentials between the self-pumping
       nuclei are self-cohering  (in  their  internal  EM)  throughout  the
       mirror material by  what  is called "self-targeting,"  but  that  is
       another story too  long to detail here.  The second (1904) Whittaker
       paper I cited  is  also  quite revealing.   Here's  what  it  shows.
       Rigorously, you can  replace  all  of classical forcefield  EM  with
       scalar potential interferometry.   Period.   Note  that  this  paper
       actually incorporates the  Aharonov-Bohm   effect,   decades  before
       Aharonov and Bohm's seminal 1959 paper.  It also drastically extends
       it, for it is dealing with macroscopic effects, not just mesoscopic.
       Also, please note that scalar interferometry is not  an  oxymoron,in
       spite of being so labeled by one eminent scientist.

            If you  realize  that the scalar potential is totally vectorial
       in its Whittaker internal composition, and comprised of multiple
       EM waves, then when one interferes  two scalar EM potentials, one is
       simply doing multiple  wave  interferometry  simultaneously.    It's
       perfectly good "wave"  interferometry; it's just a whole bunch of it
       at once.  And the wave interference  actually connects hyperspace EM
       waves with 3-space EM waves.  The hyperspatial EM wave  interference
       creates 3-space EM potential gradients (forcefields), including both
       statics and dynamics.   To  sum  up my view of the Whittaker papers,
       here's what they add to physics:

           (1)  They   add   a  second   and   completely   new   kind   of
                electromagnetics, a    hidden    hyperspatial    EM    wave
                communication inside   the  scalar  potential.   Since  the
                magnitude of  the scalar  potential  from  a  single  point
                charge does  not  reach  zero  until  an  infinite   radial
                distance is  reached,  then  each point charge communicates
                electromagnetically with  each other point in the universe,
                through the hidden Whittaker EM hyperspace channel.
                It communicates via hidden (hyperspatial)  EM  waves that a
                normal EM detector does not even see.

            (2) The  papers  allow  replacing  all  notions of external [3-
                space] EM   force   fields,   waves,   etc.   with   scalar
                interferometry of   potentials   [hyperspatial    EM   wave
                interferometry].

            (3) by  adding  the  "internal"  EM energy and its hyperspatial
                "hidden variable" communication,  the two papers do in fact
                extend each of the three disciplines: classical  EM, QM,and
                general relativity.

       Indeed, they force   consideration   of  a  sort  of  "action  at  a
       distance,"  where by   scalar  interferometry   the   local   vacuum
       potential and the  local spacetime itself are altered  and  interact
       with the system in unexpected manners.

            Since the  Whittaker  internal  EM  energy extension set is the
       same in each case, it is my view that adding the Whittaker internal

                                      Page 5





       EM does unify the three extended disciplines.  Note that it does not
       change the three present subsets.  We might also ask the following:

            Can anyone  show  any  paper  in the literature, other than the
            Whittaker work and the other  two  recent  papers I cited, that
            deals with  this  internal  organized  EM  inside   the  scalar
            potential?  If  so, I've personally been unable to find it, and
            would very much appreciate the reference.

            Does there exist any other paper  in the literature that treats
            the atomic nucleus as a pumped phase conjugate mirror?  I would
            very much appreciate the references, if there are any.

            Are there any papers at all in the literature,  where  research
            has been  conducted  in  actually  making the Whittaker-type of
            simultaneous wave/antiwave structure  as  an  artificial scalar
            potential, in beams, and performing scalar beam  interferometry
            with it  on materials and systems at a distance __ e.g., say at
            three feet in the laboratory?   If  so,  I'd  again  very  much
            appreciate the references.

       It is my strong feeling that we must get such things  looked into by
       the universities and by sharp physicists and graduate students.  The
       Whittaker approach and  the concept of using the nucleus of the atom
       as a pumped phase conjugate mirror  that one can externally engineer
       electromagnetically, do seem to lead to some startling things on the
       bench.  But presently the phenomenology is so completely unknown and
       unexpected that I  fear  we  may  never  have  a  true  science  and
       technology here unless university-level work is done on it.  Indeed,
       it's going to    take    some   good   theorists   and   some   good
       experimentalists both.

            I might add that Sweet is incorporating  the  Whittaker  theory
       into his EM theory of the device, and I expect him  to  publish that
       in the future  for  peer  review  and  examination.   His  wife died
       recently, however, and so that part  of  the effort has been setback
       for a time.   Sweet  is a good theorist (I am not),  and  he  is  an
       especially good magnetics  engineer of high caliber.  He is also, in
       my opinion, a genius on the experimental bench.

          ***  He has other highly unusual EM inventions which may ***
               receive more publicity in the future.

       I believe that, for the quaternions,  the  best  way  to describe EM
       expressed in quaternions (or better yet, in Clifford  algebra) is to
       note that the  EM  thus  expressed  has a higher topology.  It seems
       that you can get EM effects in the  higher  topology that a rigorous
       orthodox EM analysis will never reveal or appreciate.

            A very interesting reference to check in this respect __  by  a
       highly capable scientist, and with all the mathematics  __  is  T.W.
       Barrett, "Tesla's nonlinear     oscillator-shuttle-circuit     (OSC)
       theory," Annales de la Fondation  Louis  de  Broglie, 16(1), 1991,p.
       23-41.

            Indeed, I'm attracted to the notion that my own  concept of the
       nucleus as a  pumped  phase  conjugate mirror could also possibly be
       expressed in terms   of   Barrett's   OSC   exposition.    This   is
       particularly attractive because Barrett points out that in the

       higher topology the  nonlinear  optics  effects  are  achievable  by
       circuits and devices themselves,  without  the  presence  of  laser-
       matter interactions as  such.   He  also  cites  a  document  number
       225395, 1988,  U.S.   Patent   Office,  where  the  OSC  theory  was
       originally disclosed.

            The complete mathematics for decomposition of the electrostatic
       scalar potential into bidirectional  EM wave sets in harmonic phase-
       locked series is  in  E.T.  Whittaker, "On the partial  differential
       equations of mathematical  physics," Mathematische Annalen, Vol. 57,
       1903, p. 333-355.

            The complete  mathematical  proof  that  classical  EM  can  be
       completely replaced with scalar potential interferometry  is in E.T.
       Whittaker, "On an  expression  of  the  electromagnetic field due to
       electrons by means of two scalar potential  functions,"  Proceedings
       of the London  Mathematical Society,  Series 2,  Vol.  1,  1904,  p.
       367-372.

            I believe  Whittaker  actually  orally delivered both papers in
       1903.  Review and commentary from the network scientists on the
       two Whittaker papers,  and  on the  significance  of  the  Whittaker
       papers or lack   of   it,   would   be   most  deeply   appreciated.
       Particularly desired would   be   the  results  of  any  experiments
       performed in scalar potential interferometry,  at  a  mild  distance
       (say, three feet)  where each of the two interfering  potentials  is
       artificially constructed  of multiple phase-locked harmonics
       and their true  phase conjugate waves in one-to-one magnitude ratio.
       We accent that at least one harmonic  interval,  and preferably more
       than that, are essential.

                                                       Sincerely,
                                                       Tom Bearden
