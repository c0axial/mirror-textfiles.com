       The leftovers of nothing

       NOTHINGS ain't what they used to be. By using his air pump -- one of
       the high points  of  seventeenth-century technology -- to remove all
       the air from a cavity, Sir Robert Boyle made it clear to restoration
       England what a vacuum was.

       It was what was left when you took  everything  away: emptiness.  In
       the early twentieth century, quantum mechanics made  everything more
       complicated.

       A vacuum is  still  what is left over when everything is taken away;
       but that no longer means that it is  emptiness. The non-empty vacuum
       plays a fundamental role in the way physicists think about matter.

       Descendants of Boyle's air pump now produce vacuums that are, to all
       intents and purposes, completely free of matter. But  they can never
       be completely free of energy.

       According to quantum  theory,  it  is  impossible  to remove all the
       energy from any system. As in a tin  of  sardines, there is always a
       little bit in the corner that you cannot get out.

       The magnitude of  this  "zero-point  energy"  is  tiny;  as  far  as
       everyday uses go,  it  can be ignored.  Nobody can measure the zero-
       point jiggling of a pendulum caused  by the mote of energy remaining
       in the system when nothing else is left.

       But not all such effects are negligible. Electromagnetic fields also
       have zero-point energies. In the vacuum, every electromagnetic mode-
       -that is, every way in which an electromagnetic field could vibrate,
       if there was one there--has its zero-point energy.

       The energy for  each mode is tiny, but there are  an  awful  lot  of
       modes. Adding them together reveals a vacuum crammed with energy.

       It is surprisingly  hard  to  find  evidence of this sea of energy--
       largely because the level of the  energy  is  the lowest that can be
       reached.  There is no lower level with which it can be compared.


                                      Page 1





       Like sea-level for  land  maps,  the  vacuum energy is the reference
       point above which all else is measured.

       Zero-point effects do  turn  up,  though,  when  matter  and  vacuum
       interact. The first to be recorded was the atomic Lamb shift.

       Atoms are surrounded  by electrons which can have various  different
       levels of energy.  When  an  electron moves from a higher level to a
       lower one, it emits a burst of light  at  a particular wavelength: a
       photon. The wavelength can be predicted precisely from theory.

       In some cases,  though,  the wavelength observed is  different  from
       that predicted. The  difference  turns  out  to  be exactly what one
       would expect from the effects of lots of tiny electromagnetic fields
       working on the electrons--the effect of the vacuum field.

       Not only is  the  wavelength  of  the  photon  dependent  on  vacuum
       effects, so is the fact that it appeared at all. There  are two ways
       for an electron  to unburden itself of a photon and come down from a
       higher energy level.

       If the electron is hit by a photon  of the right wavelength, it will
       be knocked down, and there will be two photons where  there  was one
       before. That is stimulated emission, the principle behind the laser.

       Alternatively you can wait for the electron to jump down on its own,
       giving up its photon by spontaneous emission. When the vacuum energy
       is taken into  account,  the  distinction  between  these two breaks
       down.

       Spontaneous emission can be seen  as  stimulated  emission, with the
       zero-point energy of  the vacuum providing the stimulation.  So  the
       emission of light  does  not  depend just on the atom--it depends on
       the way that  the atom and the vacuum  interact.   By  changing  the
       vacuum, you can change the way the atom emits light.

       A vacuum between two sheets of metal is not the same as one that is
       unconstrained. Some of  the modes of the electromagnetic  field  are
       suppressed--the modes which  represent  waves  in the field that are
       too big to fit into the cavity.

       By changing the size of the cavity,  you  can  lose  certain  modes.
       Groups of scientists around the world have built cavities  that rule
       out certain modes  of  vacuum  energy,  and  thus  stop  atoms  from
       emitting photons at various wavelengths.

       Using a related technique, they have  designed  and  built  cavities
       that enhance the radiation by allowing the atom to  "see" more modes
       of the vacuum radiation than it would if there was no cavity.

       The results of   such   experiments   allow  scientists  to  explore
       otherwise inaccessible areas of quantum  electrodynamics, the theory
       of electromagnetic fields.

       An intriguing theoretical  point about the way that  atoms  interact
       with vacuum has  been  made  by  Dr Hal Puthoff of the Institute for
       Advanced Studies in Austin, Texas.

       For every atom there is an energy level below which the electrons

                                      Page 2





       cannot sink. Dr  Puthoff  suggests  that this is because, at the low
       energy levels, electrons cannot lose  energy  any  faster  than they
       pick it up from a vacuum.

       It is the  vacuum  energy  that  buoys them up, stopping  them  from
       losing all their energy and collapsing into the atomic nucleus.

       That means that  the  vacuum underpins the stability of every atom--
       and thus of almost all matter in the universe.

       Force from nowhere Vacuum zero-point energies can explain effects on
       a larger scale  as well. The vacuum  energy  exerts  a  pressure  on
       everything.  Normally, this  pressure  has little effect,  since  it
       comes from all directions at once and almost cancels out.

       But if two  atoms  are  reasonably  close  to  each other, each will
       shield the other from some of the  pressure.  There will be slightly
       less pressure FROM the direction of the neighbouring atom than there
       is from every  other  direction--so  the  atoms will  tend  to  move
       together.

       This is the  Van  der  Waals  force. Though it is weak, it is strong
       enough to hold atoms and molecules together in gases and liquids.

       There are other ways to describe Van  der  Waals forces, in terms of
       the way the electrons jitter around the atoms, but  they also depend
       on the vacuum; they just come at it in a different way.

       An analogous force  can  be  measured  between parallel metal plates
       which are placed  close  together--say   a   few  thousandths  of  a
       millimetre apart.

       Because the distance  between  the  plates  limits  the  wavelengths
       available for the zero-point energy, there are fewer modes available
       in the vacuum between the plates than in the vacuum outside.

       So the pressure  from  outside is greater, and becomes greater still
       as the plates are pulled together and yet more modes are ruled out.

       This "Casimir effect" may prove an  obstacle  for people who want to
       build machinery ever smaller, since it will tend to  stick  surfaces
       together.

       On the other  hand,  it  may be an opportunity. Dr Robert Forward, a
       physicist who is always ready to speculate  on  the outlandish--from
       antimatter-driven spaceships to  life on the surfaces  of  collapsed
       stars--has suggested a simple, impractical machine that could remove
       energy from the vacuum using the Casimir effect.

       It is farfetched,  but  getting the Casimir effect to do useful work
       by holding things together is theoretically possible.

       There are further  reaches  to  vacuum   energy   ideas   which  are
       controversial, but still  intriguing.  Over many years,  Dr  Timothy
       Boyer of the City University of New York has tried to show that many
       of the results  of quantum physics can be achieved using none of its
       assumptions, provided that zero-point energy is allowed.

       Dr Puthoff has recently revived an idea mooted by Dr Andrei Sakharov

                                      Page 3





       in the 1960s that gravity itself can be explained by vacuum effects,
       more or less as a very long-range version of the Van der Waals force
       between atoms and molecules.   That goes against the grain of modern
       theory, but some  broad-minded  colleagues  see  it as an intriguing
       speculation.

       And there is  the question of the  other  sorts  of  energy  in  the
       vacuum.  Interest has focused on the residual electromagnetic fields
       because there is a successful theory with which to discuss them. But
       there are other types of field--those associated  with  the  nuclear
       forces--that are less well known.

       The way that  quarks  are  bundled together in nuclei may have to do
       with vacuum pressure. There may  still  be  a  lot  of  mileage  for
       physicists in thinking about nothing at all.
