                           Newton - engine follow-up

       How to use a constant force to build a practical Perpetuum Mobile

To begin with this is the second text on the more general Newton Engine
principle. The first text describes an implementation with electronic
components.

The method described in this text attempts to build a case for the Perpetuum
Mobile using no more than Isaac Newton's formulas for Energy and Distance.
Indeed, the very science that holds the Perpetuum Mobile to be impossible,
also use these formulas as fundaments

We will use a standard commercially available bilge pump, a rotor plate of
radius 1/2 meter.

Pump parameters:      Pin = 210 Watts
                        Q = 4000 liters/hour at 2m elevation = 1,1 Liters/sec

                Tube diam = 1 inch = 2,54 Cm = 0,254 dm

All we now have to do is to find the constant FORCE that this pump will give.
Then we place a tube on the rotor so that the water flows radially out towards
the periphery, and finally the tube is bent so that the water is expelled
backwards compared with the direction of rotation. This then produces the
forward thrust we need.

We find this FORCE to be:

    Pressure P = Tube Volume * Water Density / Tube Area
               = Phi * (0,254/2)^2 * 20 dm * 1(Kg/dm^3) / Phi * (0,254/2)^2
               = 20 [Kg/dm^3]

      FORCE  F = Pressure * Area tube = 20 [Kg/dm^3]  *  Phi * (0,254/2)^2
               = 1 Kg  =  10 [N]

This thrust force is a minimum for the pump, because it is calculated for an
elevation of 2 meters, or 20 dm.

Now we can use Newton's formulas to find what amount of POWER we can get
(load) from the rotor at a particular rotational speed:

Kinetic Energy Ek = Force * Distance  =  F  *  S  [Joule]
                S = V * t [m]

               Ek = F * S = F * ( v * t ) = F * v * t

         Power  P = Ek  /  t  =  F * v * t  /  t  =  F * V  [Watt]

From this simple formula we see that with a constant force that does not
depend on the speed, the output Power is directly proportional with the speed
at the periphery.

This is important, because it means that regardless of what amount of constant
input power is required to produce the constant force, the output power can
always be made larger than the input by increasing the speed sufficiently.

At what speed will we have equal output and input power, or 'break-even'?

In our example we have an input power of 210 Watts. Lets do the calculation:

        Po = Pi  F * V = 210 10 * V = 210 V = 210 / 10 = 21[m/s]

We see that it will require a peripheral speed of 21 m/s to 'break-even'. This
equals different RPM's depending on the rotor radius:

         Rotor Radius  0,25 0,5 1 [Meter]
                 RPM   800 400 200 [RPM]

The input power of 210 Watts would have to be supplied all the time.  What if
we supplied it from a generator driven by the spinning rotor?  The 210 Watts
would then have to subtracted from the output power we found earlier:

        Available output Pn = Po - Pi = 10 [N] * V[m/s] - 210
                            = 0,53 * RPM - 210 [Watt]

At 400 RPM's all the output is used to drive the pump. At lower RPM's the
device uses more power than it produces. But, at RPM's above 400 RPM's it will
start producing surplus power whilst being self-supplied with drive power.

E.g. at 800 RPM's it would give 210 Watts available output to be spent, whilst
     at the same time feeding back 210 watts to drive the bilge pump.
