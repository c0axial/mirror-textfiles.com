                       A Description of the Newman Motor
                           by Roger Hastings, Ph.D.

       This  document  is intended to provide information regarding  the
       energy  device  invented  by  Mr.   Joseph  Newman  of  Lucedale,
       Mississippi. I have prepared the material in response to numerous
       requests  for  information.  The  number of  these  requests  has
       increased dramatically since Newman's public demonstration of his
       motor at Washington,  D.C.,  in May,  1985. This paper provides a
       personal history to date of my involvement with Newman,  presents
       data which was taken at the Washington demonstration, provides an
       analysis of the data,  and presents my current thoughts regarding
       a mathmatical description of Newman's motor.

       HISTORY
       I first met Mr. Newman in September, 1981. Newman is an inventor,
       and  he had travelled to Minnesota to present a toy invention  to
       Tonka Toys Corp.  My brother,  John, was at the time in charge of
       new products for Tonka,  and he interviewed Newman.  John and Joe
       wound  up  discussing  their respective theories  of  matter  and
       energy, and Joe's motor. At that time, Joe was looking for people
       to  verify the operation of his motor for the patent  office.  He
       invited John to Lucedale, but John said that his brother (me) had
       a Ph.D. in physics, and therefore better credentials to offer for
       the testing of a motor.

       My first reaction to the news of Newman's energy producing  motor
       was  quite negative.  I had been a professor for four years,  and
       had encountered several people with "world saving" energy devices
       which they wanted evaluated by the University.  In all cases such
       devices  had  proven to be inoperative as net  energy  producers.
       Newman  offered to fly me to Lucedale to test his  motor,  and  I
       responded that he would be wasting his money and our time because
       I would certainly prove him wrong. He insisted, and I complied.

       The  motor that I saw on that first visit was a monument to  Rube

                                      Page 1

       Goldberg, and to an incredible personal effort at building such a
       large  device.  It consisted of five thousand pounds of #5  gauge
       wire  wound  as  a solenoid.  Within the solenoid,  a  600  pound
       ceramic  magnet rotated on questionable  bearings.  The  bearings
       were mounted in a wooden structure. On the shaft of the rotor was
       a mechanical commutator consisting of three home made wheels, and
       brushes  whose  tension  was  adjusted  with  rubber  bands.  The
       commutator  received  its power from a bank of six  volt  lantern
       batteries.  As  the  huge  magnet rotated,  the  whole  structure
       creaked  and  groaned.  At that time,  Newman was  taking  energy
       output  from  a secondary coil wrapped around the  motor  primary
       solenoid. I measured the voltage and current input simultaneously
       on  an  oscilloscope.  The  output load was  a  resistor,  and  I
       similarly  measured the output voltage and  current.  Multiplying
       voltage  and current to find power,  I determined that the  motor
       was about 90% efficient.

       Newman  claimed  that his motor was not performing up to  par  on
       that  day,  and  said that he would ask me back when he  had  the
       device tuned up properly. Although I had proven that the motor at
       that time was not producing a net energy gain, several aspects of
       Newman and his motor were fascinating.  First,  the motor was not
       designed efficiently. Large mechanical losses were evident, and a
       90% efficiency seemed highly unusual. Second, the huge magnet was
       rotating at some 60 RPM with an input power of only a few  watts.
       Finally,  Newman  himself,  while unconventional,  seemed  highly
       intelligent,   definately  a  creative  thinker,   and  intensely
       dedicated  to  his scientific work.  He informed me that  he  had
       evolved  his theory and filed for a patent before he had built  a
       prototype motor. (I will discuss his theory later.)

       I  travelled again to Lucedale and indeed Newman had tuned up his
       motor.   From   that  point  foreward  I  consistantly   measured
       efficiencies in excess of 100%.  At this point I began an  effort
       to attract scientific interest in Newman's motor,  and to aid him
       in  obtaining a patent.  I wrote several affidavits and documents
       describing  my  measurements and  generally  supporting  Newman's
       efforts.  I  have spent countless hours of my spare time over the
       past four years on this effort,  withour renumeration.  It  takes
       little  immagination to understand the benefit to the human  race
       which  would  result  from an economical device  which  generates
       energy with no external input.  In my opinion, Newman's motor has
       performed  well  enough that the scientific community  should  be
       showing great interest.

       Over  the years,  a number of generic questions  have  repeatedly
       been  asked.  Is there a hidden energy source?  The device can be
       viewed from all sides, and there are no external connections. The
       motor has been transported across country, and works equally well
       at all locations.  The motor has been duplicated by at least  one
       other  person,  who  claims that it works.  Newman would  not  be
       acting   in  his  own  self  interest  to  simultaneously  invite
       publicity and commit fraud.  It is generally known that Newman is
       sincere and honest.

       Why  isn't  the  motor  running  itself  without  the  need   for
       batteries?  While  in  concept  the motor should  be  capable  of
       running itself without batteries, the technological problems have
       not  been  solved which would allow such operation.  In a  sense,

                                      Page 2

       however,  the  motor  does run itself.  The motor has  shown  the
       capacity  to charge up the batteries which provide voltage to the
       motor.  Tests have been run in which up to 15 amp-hours of output
       have been drawn from the motor, and in which the six volt lantern
       batteries  powering the motor have shown no evidence of an energy
       loss (the battery condition was verified in the labs of Ray-O-Vac
       Battery  Co.).  Tests  have  been run in  which  apparently  dead
       batteries have been connected to the motor. The motor has charged
       up  these  batteries  to the point where  they  can  power  other
       devices.  The same batteries can be drained down (e.g.  through a
       resistor),  then  be  re-connected  to the Newman  motor  and  be
       charged up while they run the motor.

       Why  isn't Newman's motor powering a home or auto?  In my opinion
       such  a demonstration would convince all skeptics,  and create  a
       great  demand  for  the  motor.  Newman  has  proceeded  in  this
       direction.  He has built at least four prototype motors to  study
       the effect of varying motor parameters.  He has steadily improved
       upon  his large prototype,  and has succeded in generating up  to
       about 200 watts of power.  By contrast,  an average home requires
       one to three thousand watts on the average,  with peak demands of
       up  to 20 thousand watts.  In this regard,  it would be extremely
       helpful for establishments with high tech capabilities to aid Joe
       in scaling up the motor output.  His approach has been to  reduce
       the  physical  size of the motor to make it economical,  and  the
       output  power.  His  greatest  technical problem  has  been  high
       voltage switching.

       Why  does  Newman  keep his  technical  process  a  secret?  This
       question was answered at Washington in May,  when Newman revealed
       the  construction  details  of his motor to the  public.  He  has
       published  a  book  ("The  Energy  Machine  of  Joseph   Newman",
       available  from  Newman  Publishing,  Rt.  1,  Box  52,  Lucedale
       Mississippi  39452),  in  which he describes his theory  and  his
       motor.   Joe   had  kept  the  process  secret  to  avoid  patent
       infringement.  Although his patent is still pending in the  U.S.,
       it  has issued in other countries.  Presumably his patent  rights
       will  be protected in the U.S.,  although it should be noted that
       his  motor  is being copied by others,  so that issuance  of  his
       patent in the U.S.  is of immediate importance. Garland Robinnett
       of  CBS  news  in  New Orleans has run a  number  of  reports  on
       Newman's struggle with the U.S. Patent office.

       I  do not fully understand why the scientific community  in  this
       country has not shown more interest in Newman's motor. He has had
       support from about 30 independent scientists and engineers,  most
       of  whom  own their own engineering or consulting firms.  He  has
       also  received  some  financial  support  from   investors,   who
       represent  a  range of interests,  including oil  and  electrical
       power interests. I know of no one who has observed Newman's motor
       and  taken measurements who has been able to show that his claims
       are invalid. On the contrary, most observers come in as skeptics,
       and  leave  as  believers.  Over the  years  my  colleagues  have
       consistantly  provided me with arguments questioning the validity
       of  my  measurements.  I  have responded to  these  questions  by
       modifying the measurement proceedures and creating new tests.  In
       all  cases  the  Newman  device  has  passed  the  tests  to   my
       satisfaction.  In my opinion, Newman has at least discovered some
       interesting and unusual new phenomena, and at most has discovered

                                      Page 3

       a  process  which  will  end  man's  dependence upon limited  and
       polluting energy resources.
