                      Vacuum, Spacetime, Frame, and All That

       You also  have to make the notion of "spacetime" less mysterious.
       It's just  vacuum, by  the way,  and potential, and energy.  It's
       also used  in two  different senses:   (1)  In  general,  when  a
       specific frame  has not  been imposed  or selected,  and  (2)  in
       specific, when a specific frame has been imposed and selected.

       When the  specific frame  is imposed, you've already assumed that
       you know  the conditions and ordering of the vacuum for the whole
       universe, that  the distance  between every  two points  (and the
       time between  them) has  been rigorously  measured and determined
       and fixed, etc.  You've already assumed the fundamental operation
       of the  entire universe,  its physics,  everything!  So beware of
       thinking just in a fixed frame.  In that sort of thinking, you've
       got a  lot of  built-in, sweeping,  global assumptions  that will
       elude your  recognition unless  you're careful.   Many scientists
       don't realize  this.  They think in one frame at a time, and then
       make  grand   pronouncements  about  the  entire  nature  of  the
       universe, not  realizing that  they already assumed those answers
       in the first place.

       So  watch   out  for  the  trap  of  assuming  that  "space"  and
       "spacetime" and  "vacuum" are  all synonymous  with  "frame"  and
       "spacetime frame."   They're not.  Vacuum per se doesn't have any
       fixed length  and time;  the observer's  mass reaction  with  the
       vacuum potential determines and makes those quantities.

                The Speed of Light Is Not a Universal Constant

       The speed  of light  in vacuum  is also not a universal constant.
       [46]   Sorry about that.  The speed of light in a given, specific
       vacuum of specific potential magnitude is constant.  Note that to
       first order the vacuum is just electrostatic scalar potential and
       therefore just virtual photon flux.  The intensity of VPF flux is
       the electrical charge density.  So the speed of light in a given,
       specific vacuum  of specific  electrical charge is constant.  But
       if you  change the  vacuum's ambient electrical charge density __
       i.e., change  the value  of that  vacuum potential's magnitude __
       you can make light passing through go faster or slower, depending
       upon  whether  you  decreased  or  increased  the  vacuum  charge
       density. [47]
                                    Page 1

       In fact,  you can  make local time go much faster or much slower,
       if  you   take  the  time  to  substantially  activate  the  mass
       potential, because  the VPF  exchange  between  vacuum  and  mass
       (nucleus) is  far greater in the mass potential than in any other
       kind  of  potential.    I  was  once  involved  in  an  unplanned
       experiment where,  after several hours of Frank Golden's charging
       the area  with two  powerful scalar EM wave generators, we messed
       up all  the clocks in the area __ grandfather mechanical pendulum
       clocks, electric watches and clocks, mechanical windup clocks and
       watches,  battery-operated   clocks,  everything  __  because  we
       altered the  ambient "mass potential" of the area.  We charged up
       or activated  all the  local mass, and in doing so we made a zone
       in which  time flowed  at a  somewhat different rate.  There were
       other phenomena  which I  am not  at  liberty  to  discuss.    It
       required four days for the activation to discharge, and things to
       return to normal.

                  The Multiple Nature of "the" Ambient Vacuum

       Another problem  is  that  "the"  ambient  laboratory  vacuum  we
       normally have  or consider  is really  jillions and  jillions  of
       vacua,  simultaneously,   in  interference   with   each   other.
       Spacetime, to  the first  order you  see, is  just  electrostatic
       scalar potential.   (It's  just scalar  potential, to  nth order,
       without restriction  to  considering  just  virtual  photons  and
       electromagnetics.).     Since  that  potential  isn't  adequately
       defined in  physics or  EE either,  I'm sending  some papers with
       proper definitions.

       Actually, scalar  potentials (Vacua!   Spacetimes!)  from charged
       particles __ both static and dynamic __ all over the universe are
       continually  interfering  in  each  differential  volume  of  the
       observer's spacetime.   Whittaker's  first paper tells us how the
       hidden EM energy flows between any point and every other point in
       the universe, right through each of these potentials from distant
       sources.  By Whittaker's 2nd paper (1904), the local interference
       of  these   potentials  generates   continual  scalar   potential
       gradients __  EM forcefields,  if you  will,  when  you  stick  a
       measuring charge  in the  gradient to  provide observable charged
       particle translation [which is what the E-field, e.g., is defined
       in terms  of].   The rapidity  of the  interfering changes in the
       local vacuum  potentials is  phenomenal, but  the interference is
       totally deterministic.  However, all the fine-grained information
       is totally  lost to  the observer.  Hence it appears to him to be
       statistical.

                      Generation of Zero-Point EM Fluctuations

       Note that,  in the differential of local spacetime vacuum that we
       are examining,  "the"  vacuum/potential  is  actually  incredible
       numbers of  dynamically changing vacua/potentials, all in violent
       interferometry a  la Whittaker's  second paper.   In other words,
       "the" ambient  vacuum is  really not  just "a" single vacuum, but
       many,  many,   many  dynamic  vacua  all  at  once,  and  all  in
       interference.   By Whittaker  1904, their interference (as scalar
       potentials) is  what deterministically  produces the local highly
       noisy virtual  EM field  gradients __ the zero-point EM energy of
       the quantum mechanical vacuum.

                   Puthoff's Cosmological Feedback Principle

       Puthoff  referred   to  this  vacuum  situation  of  individually
       deterministic but  conglomerated statistical local EM fluctuation
       effects, from  the potential  energies  of  the  distant  charged
       particles of  the universe, as a cosmological feedback principle.
       You should  also read  Puthoff's articles, as cited in my papers,
       and perhaps  some of  his references  dealing with  the exploding
       field of  stochastic electrodynamics  (SED).   The  only  present
       problem  with   SED  is  that  its  practitioners  have  not  yet
       discovered Whittaker's  two papers (1903 and 1904), and therefore
       do   not   incorporate   nature's   highly   organized   internal
       electromagnetics.

                 Adding a Potential to "the" Vacuum Potential

       When   you    make   "a"   potential,   you   make   "a   single"
       spacetime/vacuum.   That's sitting  on  top  of  (adding  to  the
       magnitude of), or lowered into (decreasing the magnitude of), the
       conglomerated "ambient  vacuum potential"  that  is  the  "normal
       vacuum."   That  added  scalar  EM  potential  is  a  beautifully
       organized,  EM,  spatiotemporal  lattice,  per  Whittaker's  1903
       paper.   It's filled  with  organized,  phase-locked,  EM  energy
       waves; it  is not  a random mishmash at all.  You must understand
       that.   You can organize and engineer local spacetime itself, and
       even do it at a distance.

              Solution to the Missing Chaos of Quantum Mechanics

       In fact,  when you  add a potential to the ambient vacuum (to the
       ambient vacuum  potential), you  add something  that is perfectly
       ordered to  the statistical "ambient vacua."  Thus you have added
       hidden order into the local statistics.  That's the missing chaos
       in quantum  mechanics __  the hidden  order that  everyone's been
       desperately looking for.

                              Spacetime Is Energy

       At any  rate, the ambient vacuum is "spacetime," and is (to first
       order) a  conglomerated scalar  EM potential, of very high value.
       Please read  that statement  again.  Then read the definitions of
       energy, scalar  potential, and  electrostatic  scalar  potential,
       that we  have included  in a footnote to this paper.  Notice that
       vacuum/spacetime is  pure energy  __ and  to first order, pure EM
       energy.   So we  are like  a bird  on an electrical high line; we
       live directly  in an  extremely high  potential,  but  not  in  a
       potential gradient.   That's  a flat  spacetime; it  has the same
       ambient "potential"  magnitude everywhere.   If  you  change  the
       ambient potential  of the local vacuum from point to point in the
       neighborhood, that's  a  curved  local  spacetime.    Imagine  ST
       curvature as  a change  in the  "virtual ambient pressure" of the
       local vacuum.   That  "ambient  pressure"  can  be  increased  or
       decreased, hence  the two "curvatures."  Simple as that.  You can
       curve it in two ways: (1) increase the local ambient value of the
       vacuum potential,  or (2) decrease the local ambient value of the
       vacuum potential.   So  local ST  curvature really  isn't any big
       deal.  And you can do it on the lab bench.

                 Trapped EM Energy Is Gravitational Potential

       As is  well-known in general relativity, it is the trapped energy
       in mass  that is  responsible for  its  exhibiting  gravitational
       attraction.  Again, Einstein's E = mc(exp2) is a prescription for
       the amount of electromagnetic energy that is trapped in a mass m.
       An electrostatic scalar potential is just one where the EM energy
       is trapped  (see the first Whittaker paper, 1903, for the EM wave
       form  in  which  it  is  trapped).    So  if  trapped  energy  is
       gravitational in  mass, it  is gravitational  in the potential as
       well.   In GR,  all potentials  are therefore  gravitational.  In
       fact, there  is no  such separate  thing as  "the"  gravitational
       potential; "the" G-potential is made from a conglomerate of other
       fields/field effects,  which is  Sakharov's hypothesis  [48].  To
       first order,  the G-potential  is a function of the trapped local
       EM energy density of the vacuum.

                  The Quantum Potential: Action At a Distance

       You must also at least get acquainted with the quantum potential,
       and its  place in  hidden variable quantum mechanics theory.  The
       quantum potential  (QP) is  a potential added to the Schroedinger
       potential.   It  provides  an  instantaneous  connection  between
       separated components,  even over great distances.  The QP appears
       to have  no point  source, in  sharp contrast  to  the  classical
       potential.   The QP field is not radiated in the classical sense.
       In general  the QP  between two particles (or two components of a
       system exhibiting  a macroscopic QP) does not produce a vanishing
       interaction  between  the  particles  (or  components)  as  their
       spatial separation  becomes very  large.    The  QP  contains  an
       instantaneous connection  between  separated  components  of  the
       system, rather  than the  retarded  connection  provided  by  the
       classical potential.   Thus  with  a  QP,  two  widely  separated
       components of  a physical  system may  be strongly  and  directly
       connected.   The QP  of a  system depends on the quantum state of
       the system as a whole, even when its parts are greatly separated.
       In  the   case  of  a  QP  established  by  separated  electronic
       equipments, the  QP depends on the "structured graviton" state of
       all the  radiative components,  circuits, devices,  transmitters,
       etc. [49][50]

          As Trapped EM Energy, Mass Is a Special Scalar EM Potential

       Since (see definitions in the footnotes to this paper) trapped EM
       energy is  also a  scalar EM  potential, then it follows that the
       mass (of  the nucleus  or a fundamental particle) can be regarded
       as, and  is, a  special kind  of very,  very  intense  scalar  EM
       potential.   I call  it the  mass potential  to differentiate  it
       because of  its  fantastic  strength.    Not  only  is  the  mass
       potential a  scalar EM  potential, but it is also a gravitational
       potential.   Note that  the concept  of the  mass potential  is a
       unifying field concept, for unifying gravity and EM fields.

       The beauty  of the  mass potential  concept is fourfold: (1)  Now
       mass has  a universal  kind of  organized EM  internal structure,
       given by  Whittaker's 1903  paper, that comprises the mass in the
       first place,  (2) the  hidden internal  EM structure  of the mass
       potential   can    be   changed    and   engineered    at   will,
       electromagnetically, by  external means  and directly, (3) we now

                                      Page 4

       have direct  electrogravitation, opening up the vista of directly
       engineering antigravity  (as Sweet  has  already  proven  in  his
       vacuum triode device) [51], and (4) the internal structure of the
       nuclear  mass   potential  can   be  deliberately  altered  in  a
       nonequilibrium manner  vis a  vis its  virtual photon  flux (VPF)
       exchange with  its local  vacuum, as  can be the VPF of the local
       vacuum itself.   In  that case,  you have  created a local vacuum
       engine in  the altered  Whittaker vacuum/potential,  and you have
       also created  an activated  interacting  engine  of  the  altered
       atomic nucleus  (its mass  potential), fed  by vacuum energy, and
       gating the energy out of the atom to do marvelous things __ to do
       whatever you've  been clever  enough to  design it  to do  in the
       first  place!    You  can  transmute  elements,  materialize  and
       dematerialize matter,  alter and  change a  radioactive nucleus's
       energy balance and characteristics so that it is inert, etc.

                    Gravitational Energy Is Negative Energy

       Finally, you  must be aware that gravitational energy is negative
       energy, since  it is  "withdrawn" from  the EM  scattering energy
       domain, and scattering EM energy has been designated as positive.
       You can  understand that  G-energy is  negative, in this fashion,
       after Nahin  [52]:   If two  like electrical  charges are brought
       together, energy  is required to overcome the repulsion, and this
       energy "goes into the field" to give a positive energy density of
       space.   Two positive  masses, however,  attract each  other;  it
       takes the exertion of energy to keep them apart.  In other words,
       the field energy is negative in this case. [53]  Maxwell was much
       perplexed by  this problem,  as was Heaviside __ and as have been
       many other physicists.

                      Engineering Physical Reality Itself

       In summary  of this  scalar EM  approach, there  are literally no
       limits that  cannot be  overcome.   It just  requires us  to  now
       explore and  develop the  phenomenology, advance  the theory  and
       approach, learn  how to  design and  implement what  we wish  the
       activated mass  and activated  vacuum to  do, etc.  We can change
       the so-called  "laws of  nature" in  an area  __ or  even for the
       whole earth  __ as  we wish,  using this  approach.   It  doesn't
       matter whether  we're ready  for it  or not;  the Creator has now
       laid in  our hands  the power  to  alter  and  engineer  physical
       reality itself, as we may wish.

                             Nonlinear Oscillation

       One also  needs to  be aware of nonlinear oscillator theory. [54]
       One  will  encounter  in  scalar  EM  the  effects  of  nonlinear
       oscillation,  including  harmonic  and  subharmonic  oscillation,
       self-oscillation, etc.   The  organized graviton  structure of  a
       scalar potential is organized (and in fact phase-locked) in terms
       of both harmonic and subharmonic oscillation.

                     Mind and Matter and Their Interaction

       Without further  amplification, we  will also  state  that  mind,
       matter,  thought,  and  the  deepest  living  biological  control
       functions also  utilize the  Whittaker internal electromagnetics,
       and have  done so  since the  beginning.   We now  know where the

                                      Page 5

       software is,  how it is filed, and how to go about engineering it
       directly.   We have  already advanced  the precise  mechanism for
       Sheldrake's morphogenetic field, and explained how it generates a
       change in  a species in a complete evolutionary "jump."  We state
       without further  elaboration that  specific, testable  mechanisms
       for parapsychology  can also  be extracted  from  the  scalar  EM
       approach.  What is involved here is not only a unification of the
       branches of  physics, but  also  a  unification  of  physics  and
       metaphysics.

                 Biological Effects of EM Fields and Radiation

       As is  well-known, the  question of  whether or not EM fields and
       radiation may contribute to incidences of leukemia, brain tumors,
       and other health changes is unresolved.  Four decades of the best
       technical efforts  of many  able researchers,  together with  the
       entire body  of experimental  data they  have gathered,  has been
       unable to  technically and  decisively resolve  the issue.    The
       studies and  experiments have  continued to  be contradictory and
       inconsistent, and  replication of  results has  continued  to  be
       difficult and  often impossible.   What  the experimental results
       actually show  is that  there are  uncontrolled  and  unknown  EM
       variables in  the experiments,  hence in  the experimental  model
       being applied  __ either  consciously or  unconsciously __ by the
       experimenters.

       The  standard   experimental  model   (SEM)  that   EM/bioeffects
       researchers apply,  either wittingly or unwittingly, rests on two
       major postulates,  that: (1)  the present  theoretical  model  of
       electromagnetics is  correct  and  complete,  and  sufficient  to
       characterize both  the EM  stimulus to  the biological system and
       the causative mechanism for biological effects, and (2) the gross
       EM dosage/response  model __  energy  deposition,  or  "heat"  by
       another  name   __  used   in  the   measurement  instrumentation
       adequately characterizes  EM stimulus/bioresponse,  for measuring
       and interpreting the factors and results of the experiments.

       Both fundamental  postulates are  seriously  in  error,  and  the
       standard  experimental  model  is  therefore  seriously  invalid.
       Using the SEM by rote for four and a half decades has resulted in
       the present  state of  confusion, inconclusiveness, conflict, and
       indeterminacy in  the field.   Mostly what the experimenters have
       really shown to date is that: (1) their own experimental model is
       hopelessly flawed, (2) their instruments and instrumental methods
       are inadequate,  and (3)  the classical  EM theoretical  model is
       inadequate for their experimental tasks.

       Living systems  have long  used the internal EM Whittaker channel
       for deep  cellular control of the organism.  By manipulating this
       channel, Kaznacheyev  [55] showed  EM induction of cellular death
       and disease  into environmentally  protected cell  cultures. [56]
       Priore [57]  demonstrated __  under rigorous  scientific controls
       [58] __  absolute cures  of  terminal  tumors  and  leukemias  in
       laboratory  animals.    Popp  [59]  also  discovered  the  master
       cellular control  system, including  its virtual  photon  storage
       characteristics,  without   knowing  of  the  internal  Whittaker
       storage channel and mechanism.



                                      Page 6

       Quantum mechanically  it has  been known  since 1959  that the EM
       potentials are  the primary  causes of electromagnetic phenomena,
       [60] and  the force  fields  are  only  secondary  __  the  exact
       opposite of  what has  been assumed  in the  classical EM  theory
       utilized by  present  experimenters  in  the  SEM.    Whittaker's
       fundamental decomposition  of the  scalar EM  potential  into  an
       internal harmonic  set of  paired bidirectional  planar EM  waves
       provides  a   rich  set   of  experimentally   and  theoretically
       unaccounted and  uncontrolled hidden EM variables involved in all
       EM bioeffects experiments to date.  The scalar EM potential is an
       organized spacetime  lattice  of  perfectly  ordered  EM  energy,
       passing through it in a Whittaker wave structure.  Living systems
       alter this  internal EM Whittaker channel (this spacetime lattice
       structure)  and   communicate  through   it  for  mind,  thought,
       personality, long-term  memory, and  deep control of cellular and
       body functions.   All  the deepest biological control systems are
       in  the   Whittaker  channel.   To  understand   environmental-EM
       bioeffects, you've  got to understand how the local environmental
       EM (both  internal and external) affects and alters the Whittaker
       channel, and hence the deep biocontrol systems utilizing it.

       These hidden  Whittaker EM  variables are  real; that is testable
       and unassailable.    The  unknown  Whittaker  EM  variables  also
       account for most if not all the serious deficiencies and problems
       of the  entire experimental field to date.  Scalar interferometry
       of Whittaker  potentials alone,  e.g., can  reproduce any kind of
       normal EM,  [61] and  the potentials  can pass deep into the body
       before  that   interference  occurs.     So  Whittaker  potential
       interferometry can produce much deeper EM fields in the body than
       present field  theory and  dosimetry would indicate.  Even worse,
       the Whittaker  potentials interact  in the nuclear mass potential
       of the  body __  and that  is where the signals and functions for
       deep cellular  control, immune  system control, etc. are located.
       Interfering EM  signals (multiphoton  effects)  in  the  external
       environment create  sporadic Whittaker  potentials, with  "noisy"
       and  often  abnormally  strong  EM  hidden  variable  structures.
       Repetitious noise  patterns in  the Whittaker  channel  gradually
       "activate" or  "charge up" the Whittaker channel of the organism.
       Thus a sort of long-term "electronic jamming" of the deep control
       systems of  the body  can result.   Gradual  degradation  of  the
       immune system  and of  the cellular  control system  can  result.
       Thus there  does exist  a  mechanism  for  long-term,  cumulative
       damage to  the biological  system..  The basic probability of the
       multiphoton mechanism  occurring for long-term effects cumulation
       and slow  bio-degradation is  primarily a  function of the signal
       density in  the specific  environment, regardless  of  individual
       signal strength  or frequency.   This "electronic smog" effect is
       presently unknown  in biophysics,  and it  has not been accounted
       for at  all in  the present  experiments and  studies in  the  EM
       bioeffects field.   Long-term presence of specific multifrequency
       mixtures then  can produce more specific short-term, medium-term,
       and long-term  effects, in  addition to  the general  degradation
       cumulating from sheer local environmental signal densities.

       Submitted for  consideration to a major 1992 scientific symposium
       is a  paper pointing  out the  fundamental difficulties  with the
       standard experimental  model, and  the exact  Whittaker nature of
       the uncontrolled  hidden variables  responsible for negating over
       four decades  of painstaking  scientific experiments.   Also  the

                                      Page 8

       paper points  out the  precise things  that have  to be  done  to
       correct the  SEM, the  instrumentation, and  the  EM  theoretical
       model, so  that future  experiments will be decisive, consistent,
       and replicable.

       If the  paper is accepted, then in August 1992 we will place into
       the scientific  literature precisely  what is  wrong with  the EM
       bioeffects field  to date, and will attempt to correct the entire
       field by  stimulating it  to account for and measure the internal
       EM  Whittaker   variables   that   are   presently   hidden   and
       uncontrolled.   With such  correction, hopefully we can avoid yet
       another   four    decades   of    indeterminate,    inconclusive,
       inconsistent, and  contradictory experimental  effort,  and  also
       remove much of the present researcher frustration.

            Aristotelian Logic and Excessive Worship of Mathematics

       One will  also  desperately  need  to  change  one's  mindset  on
       Aristotelian logic __ which nature often violates __ and one must
       get  rid   of  the   false  notion   that  "mathematics  contains
       fundamental truth,  a priori."   Mathematics is just a game and a
       model __  though a  very, very useful one __ based on assumptions
       (postulates) which  we ourselves  formulate and  build-in to  it.
       The only real "truth content" of the mathematics is judged by the
       validity of  the postulates.   Mathematics  is no better or worse
       than the  concepts assumed as its basis.  If there's any truth in
       it, it's  only what  we ourselves  have put  into it.  That's the
       reason for  the experimental  method in  science; the  only way a
       theory  can   be  falsified   or  validated  is  by  experimental
       examination and test.

       So get  rid of  the artificial mystique of "mathematics is truth,
       and the  purest activity  of the  human mind."   That's dogma and
       religion, not  science.   It is a must to read Morris Kline. [62]
       Also read  about G. Spencer Brown's extension of logic to include
       complex numbers.  [63]    Then read my own fundamental correction
       to Aristotelian  logic  by  addition  of  a  fourth  law  and  an
       applications rule. [64]  With this background, one should be free
       from the  "Aristotelian trap"  and the  unwarranted  "worship  of
       mathematics" trap.  We need the mathematics as a useful tool; but
       we  must   not  think  that  to  be  highly  mathematical  is  to
       necessarily have  an advanced  grip on  the truth.    In  physics
       today, too  often one  loses the real physics because of the over
       attachment to the beauty of the mathematics.

       The physics  of a  theory is embodied in the fundamental concepts
       associated with the mathematical symbols, not in the mathematical
       manipulation  of  those  symbols.    The  mathematics  isn't  the
       physics; the math is just the manipulation of the physics.  Don't
       confuse the  fundamental physics of a theory with the mathematics
       of the  theory. The  mathematics can  be great,  and the  physics
       still quite wrong.

                         Background For a New Paradigm

       The above  "blast" should  give you  a feel  for my work, and the
       background for  the area.   In your normal studies, you will also
       get a course in special relativity, certainly by the time you get
       your master's  degree.   If you  major in  physics, you will also

                                      Page 8

       take one  or more courses in general relativity in the curriculum
       for the doctorate.  For either the master's or doctorate degrees,
       you will  probably have  at  least  one  introductory  course  in
       quantum mechanics,  or perhaps more.  That's quite sufficient for
       understanding in  this area and working in it.  To assist a shift
       in mindset,  however, one  also needs  to read __ particularly at
       the beginning  __ a  lot of  popularized Scientific American type
       articles on  quantum mechanics,  the vacuum, zero-point energy of
       vacuum, etc.  Also read the popularized books by Heinz Pagels and
       Nick Herbert's  Quantum Reality.  Read them at least two or three
       times.  Read Paul Davies' books; even though popularized, he is a
       master craftsman, and able to clearly state the gist of the broad
       array of  present physics.   In all of your reading, it's just as
       important to notice what is wrong, awkward, assumed, or imperfect
       as it  is to notice what is known correctly.  If you haven't read
       a good  book on foundations of physics, at least read Lindsay and
       Margenau. [65]

                                   Personals

       As far as your career plans, it would be best to either seek your
       Doctorate in  EE as you plan to, with a minor in physics, or else
       major in physics with a minor in something else such as EE.  Just
       keep your  mind open and not brainwashed, in either case.  If you
       stay open-minded,  most of  your learning is going to occur after
       your doctorate anyway.

       Thanks for  your interest, and the best of luck to you.  And yes,
       more and more youngsters,   grad  students,  post-docs,  and even
       a few  senior professors are turning to this scalar potential EM,
       and I'm  absolutely delighted.   As  they  digest  the  Whittaker
       papers and  the other papers, gradually they'll start to work and
       change physics.   That's  the only  way we're  going to get a new
       science.  As Max Planck pointed out, essentially the only way you
       get a  new physics  is when  the old  physicists who so adamantly
       oppose and  block it  die off.   The future will be determined by
       the young.
