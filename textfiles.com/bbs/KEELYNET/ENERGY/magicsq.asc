  The following comments  were removed from an older message base and placed
  in this file.  Based on the idea that  Nature  follows certain geometries,
  it follows that  successful  geometries  would  be  used  most  often  and
  function as amplifiers  of  relatively  minor energy re-directions.  These
  re-directions take place in redundant  patterns  such as that of the magic
  square.

  A better way  of  understanding  can  be thought of as biasing  fields  to
  create interference patterns  with  the intent of affecting energy or mass
  currents with a harmonic or enharmonic action.  Such interferences are the
  basis of how relatively low level energies  can  cause  macro  effects  in
  associated energies.  The  concept of hyperspace and  how  energy  can  be
  removed from there in the form of "cold current" or "negative electricity"
  indicates an opposite spin which can be tapped from a properly constructed
  "gateway".

  Hi Folks!  There is some bizarre research  going  on  with  what is termed
  magic squares.  These are 2 dimensional matrices with  words  or  patterns
  that read the same horizontally and vertically..  They are said to be very
  difficult to create  especially  as  the size of the matrix increases.  It
  seems that when using these matrices  with  electronic  analogues  (coils,
  capacitors, diodes, etc.)  that one can generate anti-gravity  fields  and
  free energy devices  (as  in the Perrigo device, we will place this patent
  online when we get it scanned in).
  A sample of a typical and famous magic square is the SATOR/AREPO square.
  It looks like this   :  S A T O R
                          A R E P O
                          T E N E T
                          O P E R A
                          R O T A S
  The idea is that when specific patterns  are  formed,  they  act  as self-
  reinforcing cymatic type  waveguides  to channel energy  or  gravity  into
  specific directed flows.   The  Perrigo patent shows a collection of coils
  mounted on a matrix of rods.  These rods  are  placed in a perfect matrix,
  yet coils are only mounted on certain rods within that  matrix.  And these
  coils are connected  in  a  specific manner to each other.  We know of one
  person who built the Perrigo device (Dan Davidson) according to the patent
  and it did not work.  There is another  story of a man who was running his
  entire farm using  such a system, but after a public announcement  of  his
  accomplishment, he received a visit from unnamed persons who made it clear
  that he was  not  to  show,  record  or otherwise talk to anyone about his
  discovery.  But Perrigo is a for real patent application.
  What we are looking for is a program that will generate such patterns
  with matrices of various sizes.  In the near future, such info will be
  made available publicly for further research but for the moment it is

  Jerry,

       A good  reference on the mathematics of magic squares  is  the  Dover
  paperback "Magic Squares and Cubes", by W.S. Andrews.  I became interested
  in these in  connection with some basic studies in dimensionality that was
  a part of the analysis of the geometry  of  the apparent ruins in Cydonia.
  So I wouldn't  be  suprised if there are applications  in  vacuum  energy,
  electrogravitics, etc.
                     ----------------------------------------
  (Erol Torun is  the  mathematician who correlated the Mars images into the
  discovery of Tetrahedral geometries  having  a  distinct influence on high
  activity zones.  The basic premise has two patterns.   One  is  to place a
  tetrahedron in any  circle so that the apex (tip) is located at the "north
  pole".  The other  two tips will then  fall  at  19.5  degrees  below  the
  equator if taking  the  equator  as  a zero reference.   By  flipping  the
  tetrahedron upside down  so  that  the single tip is located at the "south
  pole", the 19.5  degree band will located  in  the  upper  region  of  the
  circle.  The tips of rotating tetrahedral geometries can  thereby  act  as
  energy absorbers or  transmitters.  Thus a band of high activity is formed
  which directly correlates  with  anolous   phenomena  such  as  the  Great
  Pyramid, the Bermuda Triangle,...etc.  Although the bands  are  not always
  DIRECTLY over such  anomalous  regions, the preponderance of such areas is
  moreso in the vicinity of these bands than anywhere else on the Earth.)

  Hmmmm,
  Magic Squares.....You might try reading "Magic Squares" by John Lee
  Fults, 1974, Open Court, La Salle Illinois.
    In the book several methods are shown and several formulas for the
  construction of the squares and their reflections are given.  As a side
  note you could construct a magic cube...or any other geometry.
  For example value 369::
                            71 64 69 8 1 6 53 46 51
                            66 68 70 3 5 7 48 50 52
                            67 72 65 4 9 2 49 54 47
                          26 19 24 44 37 42 62 55 60
                          21 23 25 39 41 43 57 59 61
                          22 27 20 40 45 38 58 63 56
                          35 28 33 80 73 78 17 10 15
                          30 32 34 75 77 79 12 14 16
                          31 36 29 76 81 74 13 18 11
  a star could be constructed that when any four numbers are added in a

                                    Page 2





  straight line, the number 74 is obtained:

                     22
               24  14  11  25
                  12    13
                     10
                 26     28

  Hi Bob!  The  idea is that the letters or numbers simply show the validity
  of the structure as a true magic squares...   In  fact,  it  is the use of
  coils, capacitors, etc.    of   different  values  IN   PLACE   of   those
  letters/numbers yet still    forming    a   kaleidoscopic   magic   square
  pattern.....  THIS OFFERS ASTOUNDING POSSIBILITIES!  since this quadrature
  replication of a single pattern (that  works)  would  be  self-feeding and
  self-magnifying....  Awaiting more  info and details on  this  interesting
  subject from our hesitant source...>>>  Jerry
