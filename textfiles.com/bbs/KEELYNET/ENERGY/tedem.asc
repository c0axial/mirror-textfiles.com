       ABSTRACT

       Electromagnetic theory as developed by many great scientists during
       a period of more than two centuries has been very successful. But
       many problems and questions remain unsolved.  Source an origin of
       electro-magnetism is still not fully understood or explained.

       The model here presented will offer a new understanding of electro-
       magnetism. It is shown that electromagnetism is a result of a
       continuous interaction process between matter and the vacuum space.
       Electromagnetism is reduced to a problem which can be described in
       terms of pure Newtonian physics.

                               =====================

       Vacuum, or "empty space" is a concept used when trying to describe a
       void or a lack of matter. However, ever since Maxwell's days, this
       vacuum space has been allotted physical properties by associating
       physical constants to it. Two such constants are Eo, the
       PERMITTIVITY of the vacuum constant, and uo, the PERMEABILITY of the
       vacuum constant, associated with the electrical and magnetic
       properties of the electromagnetic field, respectively.

       When an electric voltage is connected to two plane parallel metal
       plates (a capacitor), a displacement current seems to flow through
       the "empty void" situated between the two plates.

       A current of electrons then flows through the wires connecting the
       two plates from the battery.

       The question we may ask is whether this void between the two plates
       is empty or if there is something hidden there which mediates the
       current?
                                      Page 1




       When the capacitor has been charged, it has stored energy which
       later on can be supplied to an outer user.  Then the next
       interesting question is, WHERE is the seat of this energy?

       A similar problem arises when letting an electric current flow
       through a metallic wire (a conductor). A magnetic field then is
       created, giving rise to a magnetic force on another conductor in the
       vicinity. Even here energy is stored and the question may be
       repeated: where is the seat of that energy?

       In a careful studium we will come to the conclusion that THE VACUUM
       ITSELF is the seat of that energy. That will lead us to a hydro-
       dynamical model of electromagnetism, a model which we shall here
       discuss briefly.
                              **********************

       THE THEORY

       Energy is defined by two main variables, mass and velocity.

       Transmitting these definitions to space we can imagine that property
       of space as a field of an invisible and un-touchable fluidum
       RESPONSIBLE for this energy storing.

       The field may be seen as a pre-stage of what we normally define as
       matter.  Material particles then are parts of this field being
       fluctuations like condensed cores or drops in a cloud of rain.
       Particles interact with this field by exchanging energy and matter
       with it continously.

       As a consequence of these ideas, elementary particles as for
       instance electrons, are built up by stuff of this field but having a
       different and more ordered structure than the field.  This order in
       chaos then makes the difference between matter and the vacuum space.

               q,C           OOOO              q,C
               ------>      OOOOOO      <------
               ------>       OOOO       <------
                             qp,c    External and internal pressure of
                                     particle are the same

       RULES OF INTERACTION BETWEEN PARTICLE AND VACUUM SPACE

         *)  The amount of mass streaming into a particle is the same
             as this mass streaming out from it during the same time.

         *)  Outer impact forces from the field impinging on the limiting
             area of the particle is in balance with INHERENT EXPANSIVE
             FORCES.

         *)  The energy density of a particle is the same as the energy
             density of the outer vacuum field.

         *)  The impulse density of the mass streaming into a particle is
             the same as this impulse density streaming out from it.

       Hence, electro-magnetism is a result of a continuous interaction
       process between particle and space. Mass from the field of density q
       and velocity C streams into the particle which converts it to an
       outstreaming field of another density, qp, and velocity, c. This in

                                      Page 2





       and out-stream of matter we define as the electric field.

       NEWTON'S SECOND LAW OF FORCE

       There is a persistent statement of the modern physic that Newton's
       fundamental laws are limited and partly erroneous.

       That is only true for the approximated case where the mass of a
       moving body is treated as a constant entity. Written in its complete
       form Newton's second law of force is written :

                     (1) ================================
                         F= d/dt(mv) = dm/dt.v + m.dv/dt
                         ================================

       or in words, force is change of impulse (the product of mass and
       velocity) according with time.

       MASS FLOW

       Beside Newton's fundamental laws we also need some other basic
       relations from the fundamental physics.

       From hydromechanics (neglecting vector notations) we get the
       following relation:

                            (2) ======================
                                    m= q.A.t.v
                                ======================

       which says that the inflow mass to and through an area A will be, m,
       during the time, t, if the field density is, q, and having the
       velocity, v.

       Combining results from 1) and 2) then gives :

                            (3) =======================
                                              2
                                     F/A = q.v
                                =======================

       where F/A represents the outer impact pressure, q is the vacuum mass
       field density and, C, the field medium velocity of free field
       entities.

                                ===================

       THE PRESSURE OF VACUMM SPACE

       We study an electron (or proton) as an entity of torus form, having
       a closed area, A. The outer pressure on that area is calculated from
       (3) to :

                            (4) =======================
                                              2
                                     F/A = q.C
                                =======================



                                      Page 3





       where F/A is outer the pressure, q is the vacuum mass density and,
       C, the field medium velocity of free field entities.

       Matter of a primitive particle is a plasma of space field matter.
       With aid of (4) then the internal pressure of the particle then can
       be calculated to :

                            (5) =======================
                                              2
                                    F/A = qp.c
                                =======================

       where, qp, is the particle mass density and, c, is the limit
       velocity of matter (numerically the same as the light velocity in
       free space).

       External pressure of space and internal pressure of particle is the
       same.  Equivalence between (4) and (5) then gives:


                             (6) =====================
                                       2  2
                                  q = c /C  . qp
                                 =====================

       There exists several particles with the same charge but with
       different mass (electron and protons for instance with a mass
       difference of appr. 2000 times). But for reason of limit of space
       here, we limit outself to the electron as our reference particle,
       the electron :

       Relation area/volume: Ka/Kv = 1
           ============================================================

       According to the basic rules of interaction between particle and
       space, as defined above, mass streaming into the particle will be
       the same as the mass streaming out from it, measured over the same
       time.  That gives the equalities :

        (7) ======================

            me= q.A.te.C         The amount of mass streaming IN from
                                 space to the electron during its
                                 converting time



                                      Page 4





            mout= qout.Ae.te.c   The amount of mass streaming OUT from
                                 the particle to space during the same
                                 time.

            ===========================

       The electron converting time is defined as the time it takes for an
       electron to exchange its whole mass content to the outer space
       environment (see definition in figure 3). Then equality between in
       and outflow in formula 7 gives :

        (8) ==================

            qout= c.C/c          The outstream mass density closed to
                                 the particle surface

            ==================

       Because the outflow velocity is c (equal to the inherent limit
       velocity of matter in the particle plasma), the impulse field on
       distance, r, out from the source point is given by :

       (9) ===================
           _           2 _  2
           E  =(q.C).re .n/r     The electric field density in a point
                                 on distance r from the source point
           ===================

       During the electron converting time (see figure 3), the electron's
       entire mass is exchanged to the environment space. Then by combining
       results from (6) and (8), where in and outstreaming mass is equal to
       the electron particle mass, gives :

       (10) =====================

            C = Kt.(Ka/Kv).c      Velocity and density of space

            =====================

       DERIVING THE COULOMB'S LAW OF ELECTRIC FORCE

       Coulomb's law of electric force is the most well-known law of
       electromagnetism. Studying two points containing N1 and N2 electrons
       respectively, the N1 collection will spread a mass impulse field in
       accord with (9).

       This mass impulse is absorbed by the N2 electrons situated in
       another point on distance, r, and re-emitted by the electron's
       inherent spin, giving rise to a counter reaction force, all in
       accord with Newton's basic mass inertial laws.

       Calculating this electric field mass density on distance, r, by
       using (7) and the total mass inflow by (8) gives :

       Using the "charge concept" is the common way to characterize a

       THE ELECTRIC FIELD STRENGTH AROUND A CHARGED PARTICLE

       We have defined the electric field strength around a particle in
       formula (9). Using results from (10) and (13) we can rewrite this
       result to:

       Because the outflow velocity is c (equal to the inherent limit
       velocity of matter in the particle plasma), the impulse field on
       distance, r, out from the source point is given by : (? missing
       reference).

       In an electric capacitor, electric energy is stored in the space
       between the two plates. Our idea is that the hidden vacuum field in
       the space between the two plates is actuated by the free electrons
       on the plates. The matter associated with this field enclosed by the
       two plates is :


       (15) ====================
            Mq = q.A.D                The total field mass enclosed
                                      between the plates in a plain
                                      electric capacitor.
            ====================

       During the electron converting time (as defined in figure (3), N
       free electrons exchange its mass to space. This mass is calculated
       by :

       (16) ==========================

            min= (me.N) = q.A.te.vf

            ==========================

       vf is the effective velocity of the q field driven by the
       interacting process from the free electrons. We solve out this
       velocity to :

       (17) =========================
            vf= me.N/(q.A.te)          The velocity of the q field

       Then, by using Newton's common law for calculating energy of a slow

       THE ELECTRIC VOLTAGE OVER A PLANE ELECTRIC CAPACITOR

       Electric voltage is by common theory defined as the length integral
       of the electric field strength, hence :

       (19) =========================
                s _    _                Electric volatage is defined
            U = I E.ds.n                by the length integral of the
                                        electric field strength
            =========================

       For making it possible to make a comparison by our theory, we use
       the same definition. Then by integrating (9) we get :

       (20) ==================================================
                                       2
                  (Kt.Ka.SQRT(Ka/Kv).re .c.N).SQRT(Ka/Kv)

                                Ka.r

       which can be converted to :

                  Q.D
            U = -------.SQRT(Ka/Kv)
                  Eo.A
       =======================================================

       a result which corresponds with common theory for the case of
       SQRT(Ka/Kv)=1

       ELECTRIC CURRENT - THE ZERO IMPEDANCE OF VACUUM SPACE

       There are two basic ways of defining electric current. In common
       theory current is defined as the amount of "charge" which passes a
       cross area per unit time.

       (21) ===================

            i= Q/t                 Electric current as defined in the
                                   common way
            ===================

       The other way is to define the number of unit charges which passes
       the same cross area per unit time, hence :

       (22) ===================
                                   Electric current as defined by the
            IN = N/t               number of unit charges passing
            ===================    a cross area per unit time

       By using the common definition of impedance, we can calculate the
       space impedance in a capacitor by using the formulae (20) and (21),
       hence giving :

       (23) ==========================

            Z = U/i



                                      Page 8





                  eo.D.SQRT(Ka/Kv)
            Z = --------------------
                     Eo.Ae.eo.c
            ===========================

       Using limit values of the plane capacitor for the voltage (20) and
       the current (21), the zero or limit impedance of space can be
       calculated.

       The limit values are achieved for the case where the capacitor
       consists only by two single electrons with interacting area Ae on a
       mutual distance D=2.re from each other. Using (23) and replacing Ae
       with the electron area gives :

       (24) ===============================

            For D=2.re and Ka= 2.Kt

                  1                            Zo is the zero
            Zo = ----.SQRT(Ka/Kt)              impedance of free
                 Eo.c                          space
            ===============================

       which corresponds with common theory for the case where
       SQRT(Ka/Kv)=1.

       THE CAPACITANCE CONCEPT

       We define a function f(x) which expresses the ability of a capacitor
       to store energy as a function of its geometrical properties together
       with properties of the environment space :

       (25) =======================
                          2
            W = 1/2.f(x).U
            =======================

       Using results from (18) (20) then gives :

       (26) =====================
                      A.Eo            C is the common symbole
            f(x) = ----------= C      of electric capaciatance
                        D
            =====================

       The f(x) is the capacitance of the capacitor, usually denoted by
       letter C, (Farad).

                        ===================================

       THE MAGNETIC FIELD

       When a charged particle moves, the environment void is effected in a
       very special manner. The physical phenomena and properties of the
       space associated to it is known by the concept of magnetism.

       A simple way to distinguish between the electric and magnetic field
       is to say that ELECTRIC PHENOMENA are associated with charges AT
       REST and MAGNETIC PHENOMENA are associated with CHARGED PARTICLES
       WHEN MOVING.

       Our ambition to begin with is to derive Biot-Savart's law for the B-
       field around a conductor, a physical law of similar importance as
       Coulomb's law of the electric field.

       We start from the most simple arrangement, a straight metallic wire
       in which an electric current flows. This electric current consists
       of free charges, carrying the electric current, put forward by an
       external voltage source to the end point of the wire loop.  The wire
       is placed out in an x,y,z coordinate system.

       The current carrying particles - the electrons - are supposed to be
       smoothly distributed over the whole wire length. Hence, in a small
       section, s, there are N free electrons and the number of such
       electrons per length unit are (N/s) being a constant entity, K :

       (27) ===================

            K = Ns/s ; N =ds.K

            ===================

       The statical electric field from these free electrons is arrived at
       by (9) :

       (28) ==================
            _      _        _
            E = qr.c ; qr= /E/c/
            ==================

       It is our purpose to get a physical understanding of the magnetic
       field so we take aid of the figure 6 above. In a point outside the
       conductor, the field mass of the electric field is streaming in and
       out from the free electrons of the chosen segment, ds.  THE INFLOW
       VELOCITY IS FASTER (see 10) than the corresponding outflow velocity
       (being equal to c). The result will be a torsional effect in the
       chosen space point. The angle between inflow and outflow vectors is
       "b" and is calculated by the general sinusial theorem :


                                      Page 10

            c.dt       v.dt
            ==========================================

       which is approximately valid for the assumption that the inflow
       velocity, C, IS MUCH LARGER than the outflow velocity, c.

       Then, the magnetic field strength is the product of the electric
       field mass on distance, r, (8) and this torsional component, sinb,
       hence given by :

       where the time function has been replaced by dt=ds/v, where , v,
       represents the medium current velocity in the conductor.  The result
       of (31) inserted in (30) then gives :

       and by using results of the electric field from (9) and integrating
       along the whole conductor length gives :

       where SQRT(Ka/Kv)=1.

                     HOW AN ELECTROMOTORIC FORCE IS GENERATED
                         BY INDUCTION IN A MAGNETIC FIELD

       When a metallic conductor moves in a magnetic field, an
       electromotoric force is generated, represented by a flowing current
       or a voltage over it.

       The effect will arise mainly by two reasons

         1) if the magnetic field density is changed in accord with time or
         2) if the conductor is accelerated or retarded in the B-field.

       The remarkable thing is that THESE TWO EFFECTS CORRESPOND with the
       two terms in Newton's second law of force. The first term gives :

       (35) =========================

            F = fm/dt.v + m.dv/dt

            F = dm/dt.v
            =========================

       Dividing with a small volume element, dV, gives a term dm/dV which
       is the B-field strength. Multiplying both sides with ds.dt gives the
       unity of voltage, hence :

       (36) ===================================
                    (dm/dV)
            F/dV = ----------.v
                      dt

            F.dt.ds
            ------- = (dB/dt).v.dt.ds
              dV

       For F.dt.ds/dV = U ; v=c and dt=dr/c :

            U = (dB/dt).dr.ds = (dB/dt).dA         Electric voltage by
                                                   induction
           ====================================

       In a similar way we treat the second part of Newton's second law of
       force. Dividing both sides with a volume element, dV, gives the m/dV
       which is the B field strength. Then multiplying both sides with
       dt.ds giving the unity of voltage, hence:





                                      Page 12





       (37) =======================================

            F.dt.ds
            -------= B.(dv/dt).dt.ds
              dV

       For F.dr.ds/dV = U ; dt=dr/c  gives :

            U = B.(dv/dt).dr.ds = B.(dv/dt).dA/c    Electric voltage by
                                                    induction
           ========================================

       The total electromotoric effect then will be the sum of (36) and

       (37), giving :

       (37) ===================================

            U = ( dB/dt + (B/c).dv/dt ).dA

            ===================================

       (The second term is not known by common theory)

       THE FORCE EFFECT ON A CONDUCTOR SITUATED IN A CONSTANT B FIELD

       It is a well known effect that a conductor placed in a constant B-
       field will be effected by a magnetic force. The reason lies in the
       disturbing effect which the B field introduces on the spinning
       electrons in the conductor. This disturbance is represented by a
       mass inflow, min, which in combination with the electron spin give
       rise to a force calculated by:

       (39) ============================================
            min = q.A.t.v

                      2
                 min.c      B.(A0.c.Kt.N).to.c.ds
            F = ------- = ----------------------- =
                  re             re.Kt.to

            B.(Q/t).ds.SQRT(Kv/Ka) = B.i.ds.SQRT(Kv/Ka)

                s
            F =  IB.i.ds.SQRT(Kv/Ka)
       ===================================================
       where the calculated force effect is the same as for common theory
       in the case where SQRT(Ka/Kv)=1.

       THE ENERGY STORED IN A MAGNETIC FIELD

       The energy stored in a magnetic field is a mechanical energy stored
       by moving entities in the vacuum field, hence can be calculated by
       Newtons general laws of non-relativistic mass :

       (40) ========================
                         2
            W = (1/2).m.v
            ========================

                                      Page 13





       The mass M here is represented by the mass in a small volume
       element, dV, outside the conductor, hence :

       (41) ==================

             M= dV.q
            ==================

       If vf is the effective velocity of the current in the conductor, the
       impulse q.vf is transferred to the outside space and converted to
       the impulse of B.c, giving the equality :

       (42) ===================
            _        _
            B.c = q.vf
            _    _
            vf = B/q.c

            ===================

       Inserting result from (41) and (42) in (40) then gives the stored
       energy per volume unit of the magnetic field :

       (43) ===============================
                              2 2  2
            W = (1/2).(dV.q).B.c /q
                          2
            W/dV = (1/2).B /uo
            ===============================

       MAXWELL's EQUATIONS OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD

       The nucleus of James Clerk Maxwell's electromagnetic theory from
       1867 consist of a set of formulae which describe the behavior of
       electric and magnetic field propagation. The theory was from the
       beginning an "aether" or mechanical theory, but this interpretation
       of electromagnetism later on was denied.

       Today only a barren shell of mathematical formalism reminds us of
       the "aether theory" and these do not say much of the cause and
       source of electromagnetism.  The scientific value of these formulae
       therefore may be put into question since they seem to have been
       overestimated in importance.

       However, the most famous are:

       DERIVING THE FORMULAE

       Because of space limitations, 44a and 44b are not derived here.
       However, it is a relatively easy task to get these results, which
       are achieved by deriving the field strength out from an electric or
       magnetic point source in respect to its coordinates, x,y and z.

       Therefore, we concentrate ourselves only on the two remaining
       formulae, which mainly are got by vectorially manipulating the base
       equation (30). (44c) is achieved by taking the time derivative of
       this equation, the (44d) is arrived at by taking the space
       derivative of it.

       LIGHT AND ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES

       Beside these famous equations treated above, historically Maxwell is
       famous for predicting electromagnetic fields propagating in the same
       way as light in free space. The conclusions were made on the basis
       of comparing results from the general wave equation based on how
       sound in air or mechanical waves were propagating in a medium, air
       and water for instance.

       But the modern physics do not confess any existence of a light

       bearing aether, and the contradictory problem in Maxwell's theories
       therefore still remain.  Vectorial manipulations are performed on
       results from (45) and (47) as shown in below.

       The mathematical structure of (48),(49) and (50) is the same and it
       was this mathematical equivalency which gave Maxwell the idea of
       light being a medium carried wave. Since then many experiments have


                                      Page 16





       been perfomed using light, clearly showing that no active light
       aether to exist. Only the mathematical equivalency remains intact.

       DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC CONSTANTS AND UNITS

       As an important consequence of this theory we can establish a new
       dimensional system where even the electromagnetic units are covered
       within the realm of Newton's ordinary units of Mass, Time and
       Length. This unit analysis is presented in a table, being a useful
       source of the TRUE SOURCE source and understanding of
       electromagnetism.

       CONCLUSIONS

       Our analysis shows that electromagnetic phenomena are pure
       mechanical processes of matter on which Newtonian mechanical laws
       can be applied. Space is associated with a very high DENSE MEDIUM,
                                          3

       holding particles and matter together.

       Hence, electromagnetism, seems to be PURE MECHANICAL PROCESSES
       of matter. These new insights will offer a platform for describing
       electromagnetism and other processes of fundamental nature.
