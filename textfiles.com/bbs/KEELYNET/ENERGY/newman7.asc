       Here is an  interesting  (I think) msg I picked up on the internet..
       ..haven't started on the "N"-machine yet, but anyone who is planning
       or working on one might want to contact either Newman, or Kumar.....

                              No More Electric Bills?
                     Lucedale Inventor Wins Patent for Machine
                                By Nancy Jo Maples
                         Mississippi Press Lucedale Bureau

       LUCEDALE - For 15 years Joe Newman  has  been  trying  to get a U.S.
       Patent  for his revolutionary energy machine and NAFTA  has made his
       dream a  reality.
                               (..Stuff deleted...)

       "You'll hook it  outside  your  house  just  like  you  do  your air
       conditioning on a  concrete  platform.   It'll  come  with  its  own
       battery pack and you'll totally disconnect with the  power brokers,"
       he said.

       Well this is  the  problem   with  the Newman machines !  You need a
       battery pack (power supply) for operating  them...   Did Newman show
       how long the battery pack lasts ?

       I have done  about 3 to 4 years of studying the Newman  machines  at
       our University and  rebuilt  2  different Newman machines myself and
       got simular results as Newman described in his book.  But the

                                      Page 1




       Battery pack every time discharged after a while...

       I think maybe only his very big machines have some kind of effect.
       I visited Newman  in  1987  at his lab in Lucedale, but he could not
       show me his big machines, because they were inoperable at that time,
       and he wanted to test some new design...So  I  still  would  like to
       test and measure the first big machine that he invented...

       But nobody has  yet  put  a  Newman machine into a "calorimeter"  to
       measure the total output converted to heat energy....

       This would have  still  to  be  done, before any investor should put
       money into this technology.

       If somebody wants to see my results  on  this technology, please let
       me know.  I  still  have  my  old  Newman  machine   in   my  cellar
       downstairs...

       Newman claims the generator will pay for itself in a 10-year period.
       Does he really  say,  that  the  battery pack lasts 10 years ?  Mine
       discharged after a few hours of running time !

       Notes:
          (The following video and book  are  available  from Joe Newman at
           the stated address should you wish to order them for yourself)
       1.  A videotape describing everything is available for $25.00
       2.  A revised  edition  of  Joe  Newman's book is  scheduled  to  be
           released in May 1994.  It is available for $59.95.
       3.  These are  the  only  information and data available that I know
           of.
       4.  Joe Newman's mailing address is:
                                  Mr. Joe Newman
                                 Route 1 - Box 52
                                Lucedale, MS 39452
       5.  Newman claims the tests the U.S.  government  performed  using a
           model of  his energy device were conducted improperly  and  were
           performed not   in   agreement   with  his  written  and  verbal
           instructions, as per the government testing agreement.

       That is true !
       The NBS (National Bureau of Standards) report was totally bullshit!

       They grounded all the RF-energy by putting a resistor over the coil,
       so that they  canceled all the effects  the  Newman  machines  works
       on....  Never trust the NBS....

       Please respond with any facts you may know about this case.

       The NBS attitude is "We don't care what you think."   Or  "I  have a
       PhD in nuclear  physics  and I can 'think' better than you." We care
       about ABSOLUTE facts.  Let me know your comments....

       Vangard notes

         The mention of the RF energy being  sapped  by  use  of a resistor
         during the NBS test is what makes this particular commentary on

                                      Page 2





         the Newman  machine  noteworthy.  Besides the ambient RF, there is
         always incoming cosmic radiation.  If energy is present, it CAN be
         captured, stored and used, regardless of the source.

         For practical purposes, it is not simply the capturing and storage
         of energy, but the TRANSLATION of  that  energy into mechanical or
         other forms  that  will  yield  WORK  for  everyday   needs.   The
         currently accepted  alternative power methods such as solar, wind,
         geothermal, water and others simply  fail to achieve what has been
         anomalously reported with various F/E or O/U devices.

         We in the alternative science field simply EXPAND  our attitude to
         INCLUDE gravitators   (devices   constructed   of  materials  that
         "resist" the flow of gravity into  mass  structures,  particularly
         large ones like the Earth), ZPE or virtual flux taps  (such as the
         Hyde, Testatika,  Sweet,  Moray,  Hendershott,  Keely, Adams, etc.
         machines) or advanced thermodynamic type heat pumps, among others.

         It IS accepted that we do IN FACT  live in a "Sea of Energy" as is
         so aptly pointed out by T.H. Moray and so we should be able to tap
         into that energy by using various techniques.  When  such a device
         is freely  shared  with humanity at large, society will experience
         major changes, not only economically but also in our relationships
         with each other.  The interests  which  now  continue  to  promote
         energy as  "best"  being  available  through a very  large  single
         source, with  that  energy  then  distributed  to  each  of us and
         charged according to use, will change when the consumer is offered
         a chance to generate his own power INHOUSE for a single purchase.

         Energy consumption then is restricted  mostly  by  the capacity of
         the equipment  and  the  ability of that "locale"  to  absorb  the
         removal of  ambient  energy  from the vacuum.  Such energy removal
         must be carried out at a rate that  will allow sufficient time for
         the recovery/replenishment of "background energy" from the plenum.
         Failure to account for this replenishment results  in  the gravity
         and time  distortion anomalies frequently associated with some F/E
         units.  Or as best described by Keely, "TIME IS GRAVITY".

         As for Newman, his gyroscopic force  translation  theory accounts,
         and allows  for  the  reception and accumulation  of  energy  (RF,
         cosmic, ZPE  and  hyperspatial)  through  the  very motions of the
         atomic structures of the coil.   This  coil contains many miles of
         wire which  to  some  degree functions like Bearden's  "degenerate
         semiconductor", that   is,   it   can   absorb  potential  without
         generating current flow and thus  dissipating  the source, or more
         precisely in  this  instance,  dampening  or sapping  the  ambient
         energy.

         Most of  us in the field of alternative science, especially in the
         realm of free energy, frequently experience an attitude of supreme
         skepticism from those with crystallized  minds.  The best approach
         is not to waste time trying to convince OTHERS.   When all is said
         and done, TRUE SCIENCE is a theory, VERIFIED by an experiment that
         can be  successfully  REPLICATED  by others.  That includes a free
         energy machine, medical advances, whatever.
