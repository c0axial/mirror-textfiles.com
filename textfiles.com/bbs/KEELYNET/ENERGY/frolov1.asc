I think this is a very important and seminal document, please study it
carefully and if you choose to duplicate the circuits, we at Keelynet would
appreciate it if you would share your findings with us, thanks!...>>>  Jerry

This superior file was placed by Alexander Frolov on the InterNet and is the
first detail I have seen of the early experiments of Chernetskii and
Avramenko.  Frolov links the experimental results of these two researchers
with the high voltage stress principles used in the Testatika.

Please note, this is early Chernetskii work, before he creating the cycloid
pattern in the plasma as discussed in PLASMAFE.ASC on KeelyNet.  Avramenko
discovered a means of transmitting power through a single wire.  The wire
could be cut, tied in a bow and power would still move across the wires.

The inventor claimed he used a 'monovibrator' with a transmitter at the power
side and a receiver at the load side.  I have tried to clean up the file to
some degree for a clearer understanding.  It is an excellent file with many
clues.........>>>  Jerry

                              INTRODUCTION

The present article discusses the extraction of excess power by means of an
electric discharge (an arc).  This extraction technique relies on the
application of a field of electric potential (rather than current) for the
creation of power.

                               DEFINITIONS

        Energy is the ability to do work.
        Power is the process of work per unit of time.
        Potential is the value of energy that can be used to make the work.

                               PREHISTORY

It is clear that any experimental data can be interpreted in the light of
different conceptions.   Nikola Tesla's research work for wireless power
transmission from the point of view of energetics can be described as the
transformation of high-voltage and high-frequency electric field energy as
output power to make produce useful work in a load. The direction of some of
Tesla's patent research [1] was the derivation of excess power from electric
discharges.

Towards the end of the 1960s Prof. Alexander V. Chernetsky and Uri A. Galkin,
Institute of Electrical Engineering, Moscow, carried out experiments using
strong arc currents and observed a phenomenon they called, the "self-
generating discharge".  Figure 1 shows the voltage U and current I for this
special case of arc.

                            Figure 1

Note that for part of the cycle the current is increasing while the voltage is
decreasing.
                       dI/dt>0 for dU/dt<0             F.1

Negative resistance takes place

                            R = U/I                    F.2

This fact means that in the process of the self-generating discharge, by
Chernetsky, the power
                            P = I U                    F.3

is the inflow into the system from an outside source.

Detailed description of Chernetsky's experiments were published in English in
[2] and [3]. Power output was up to 500 Kwatts and the proof of a reverse
current from the experimental system into the electric station was detected.

The Swiss M-L converter described in [4] and [5] uses a high potential source
like the Wimshurst machine where it is connected to "spark gap cylinders".
These devices are capacitors which have spires between the cylinders to create
a "slow electrical arc" between the inner and outer cylinders.

                       SCHEMES FOR EXPERIMENTS

Let us find what is the common observations we can extract from all the above
technologies.  Chernetsky's scheme was published in the magazine Energy and
Ecology '86 in Russian, along with the following circuit:

            I           L1             I
            I                          I

          _____  C1                  I   I      (R1 is the Load consisting of
            I                        I   I  R1   5 lamps in series)
            I         arc gap        I___I
            I__________     ___________I

                   I      Sw1  I
                   I____/ _____I

                         Figure 2

A.V. Chernetsky used 5 lamps for 220 AC in series as the load. So, the
stepup transformer was rated at 220/1000 Volt, at 50 Hz.  The discharge gap
had carbon electrodes.  When switch Sw1 is open the power in the load is
increasing.

I used a hand-made stepup transformer rated at 28/2800 VAC at a 5 KHz input
and using a high-voltage lamp as the load and metal electrodes. The gap was 2-
3 mm.  A voltmeter and ammeter were used to check the input power.

You will find in this experiment that the output power is increasing when the
arc is energized, while the power in the primary circuit is decreasing.

You can check that the Conservation Law is right: when Sw1 is closed and the
current of conductivity is in force, the connection to the load will lead to
an increase of the power consumed.

So, the "plasma element" in the circuit allows for the extraction of
additional power from OUTSIDE of the system and NOT from the primary source.

Now let us consider another simple experiment that is closely connected with
the scheme above. A more detailed description of it is published in [6].

Use a high voltage metal piece, for example a screw-driver and create an arc
between the end of it and one wire of a high-voltage transformer.

               I                I
     high      I       L1       I

                ================                ______________[             \
                __/\  /\  /\  ____________     I   metal      [ insulator   /
                    \/  \/  \/             arc I______________[             \
                     L2                                       [_____________/

                               Figure 3

Check the power input and be sure that the power process of the arc is free
from the input source. (I think he means no direct short)  There will be no
power consumption increase despite the powerful arc, which is sufficient to
heat up the screwdriver.

The next version of the experiment is possible if you have a single-polarity
potential at the end of the wire for a pulsed current transformer. You will
note that with a positive potential on one wire the arc is more powerful than
for the other wire.  This difference is not demonstrated using an AC
transformer.  Both ends of an AC coil can be used for creation of the arc.

This difference will show the nature of this type of free power arc.  Positive
potential on the wire will provide for the attraction of free electrons from
the metal of the screw-driver. It is not the current of conductivity that you
are witnessing, but the DISPLACEMENT CURRENT.

Application of the above effect into a useful form can be made like the well
known Avramenko-Zaev-Lisin experiments [7]. The scheme is

                  I    L1        I               VD1
                  I  /\  /\  /\  I             ____|/|_____

                  _/\   /\  /\  /\____________I          I   I
                     \/   \/  \/              I          I   I  R  (load)
                         L2                   I          I_ _I
                                              I____|\|_____I
                                                   |/|
                                                VD2
                        Figure 4

The alternating potential as measured at point A is sufficient to establish a
current of conductivity in the closed circuit of VD1-VD2-R.  This diode pair
configuration is called 'Avramenko's plug'.

I used for this scheme a 30 VAC hand-made generator (variable oscillator) to
supply the input for L1, at a frequency of 10 KHz.  The transformer was rated
at 30/3000 Volts and the diodes rated at 1.5 KV.  The ammeter can be used as
load R. Note that an ammeter placed between the transformer and point A does
not show any current drain.

                           CONCLUSIONS

These circuits have experimentally proved the possibility of producing power
in a load by means of POTENTIAL ONLY!  Using a similar approach, mechanical
motion, rotation and even a propulsion force can be created.

So, free energetics can be formulated as the transformation of potential into
power or Energy-Power Transformation.  Since the power is a process, the
question is the parameters of the process only.

==============================================================================
Vanguard Note...

If what this paper purports is true, then Bearden is correct in his theory
that potential alone can drive a useable load.  Many people have had problems
with this claim, including me, because every power appliance we use requires
current and not just potential (voltage).

From my admittedly limited understanding of the matter, any energy can be
'translated' into a scalar form, which can be thought of as a stress soliton
(bubble) in space, rather hyperspace.

That soliton can simply exist in one location, can be 'thrown' like a ball, or
sequentially streamed in a wavetrain to a given location where a receiver
captures the solitons and translates them back into 3space.

The nature of the energy sent using this method can be totally different from
the nature of the energy received.

Once translated to the 'base medium' of a scalar bubble (soliton), it can be
re-translated from hyperspace to 3space in a form which is determined by the
receiver characteristics.

For instance, you could use magnetic energy to create the stress wave, send it
to a receiver and re-translate it back into 3space IN THE FORM of light,
electrical current, sound, heat, physical vibration, whatever you choose.

To quote from an old book 'Light, when properly resisted, can be made to yield
sound', from 'Dweller on Two Planets', available for about $18 from Health
Research, PO BOX 70, Mokelumne Hill, CA 95245.  Ask for one of their superb
catalogs.

It is interesting to note the work of Hooper, who used a moebius form to
produce what he called a 'motional field', a PURE ELECTRIC FIELD or wave if
streamed in a wavetrain.  Would not a pure electric field be pure potential?

Such a signal is INVISIBLE to matter and normal instrumentation, therefore can
be transmitted vast distances without loss of energy by inductive, capacitive
or resistive sapping.

I think there is a distinct possibility that a pure motional (electric) field
is in fact, a scalar stress bubble!

Our friend Peter Kelly, of Georgia, also indicates this by claiming
'information as energy' where the signature of a mass is held in a pure
electric field.  To alter (transmute) a mass, you must suppress the magnetic
to allow access to the electric.  Once the changes have been made in the
electric field, you restore the magnetic and the mass slowly transmutes to fit
its new pattern.

So, the potential which Frolov refers to, is probably a pure electric field
which is 'translated' from its hyperspace form to CURRENT.  Over the past
couple of years, I have been toying with the idea that electricity is nothing
more than a resistance to the flow of magnetic force and that electricity
simply would not exist without resistance to its flow.  But that's another
tall tale.....have fun and please share your findings should you decide to
experiment in this area!...............................thanks...>>>  Jerry
