                   Aether Engineering - a practical approach
                               by Jerry W.Decker

One of the approaches that KeelyNet has taken in trying to understand vast
amounts of seemingly unrelated information has been that of correlation.
Another is to look for primary claims or observations which could be expressed
in other terms or using other concepts.

The term KeelyNet reflects a reliance on the principles and concepts
discovered by John W. Keely in the late 1800's.  By no means is it to imply
Keely as our ONLY source of information or inspiration.

Another KeelyNet approach is the recognition that scientists, engineers,
academics and other degreed professionals are not the sole source of
inspiration or invention.  To that end, we promote a simplified approach to
science based on natural processes and observations.

As a kind of primer, a file was generated early on called NEUTRAL1 which
expressed the 'basics' of this philosophy.  These basics have been expanded to
include;

   1) ideas about the aether
      a)  it is omnipresent
      b)  it varies in density
      c)  it can be translated from one form to another
      d)  it can be interferred with
      e)  it flows into, creates and sustains all mass and energy
      f)  it flows into a point which exists in all individualized structures
          (mass aggregates such as a rock or a chair, molecules which make up
          the aggregate, atoms which make up the molecule, quarks which make
          up the atom, etc.)
      g)  it is the aether flow which produces gravity and its sister forces
          of electricity and magnetism
      h)  it oscillates at a very high frequency and can be interferred with
          to produce energy, matter and phenomena
      i)  a matrix can be generated to 'manifest' specific structures in
          matter based on E=MC^ yet not requiring high energy 'atomic
          processes'
   2) frequency and wavelength
      a)  everything oscillates based on its physical dimensions
      b)  oscillation produces waves which can be interferred with in a
          constructive or destructive manner
      c)  energy can be transferred via resonance from or to an oscillating
          structure or medium
      d)  a signature or matrix of frequencies can be derived from any mass
          or energy structure
      e)  a signature can be represented in two dimensions as a mandala using
          a vibrating (Chladni) waveplate
      f)  a signature can be projected into three dimensions by use of an
          energized mandala
      g)  resonance can be used to transfer matter or energy between points,
          dimensions or other quantum realities
   3) gravity
      a)  is NOT an attractive force
      b)  IS a repelling force, most easily detectable between celestial
          bodies
      c)  can be interferred with to produce
          1)  other forms of energy
          2)  loss of weight
          3)  negation of weight
          4)  positive thrust
          5)  a reduced aging zone for matter or life
      d)  weight is simply the result of being caught in the flow of aether
          towards the center of a larger mass

The idea that 'weight' can be reduced by redirecting the flow of gravity is a
radical one, yet there are ample indications that it can be redirected and has
been done.  We see it in the large, heavy stones used to build the pyramids.
We see it in StoneHenge, Easter Island, the stela in Ethiopia and other
megalithic constructions.

In modern times, the Farrow device, the Nieper ring and Edward Leedskalnins'
Coral Castle in Homestead, Florida.  Leedskalnin claimed he had figured out
how the Egyptians constructed the pyramids and proved his claims by
duplicating the moving of large stones, single-handed.

There are also the reports of flying machines such as Keely's airship,
demonstrated to the US War Department in 1896, John Searl's flying disk and
more recently the Hummel disk in Canada.  Not to mention Victor Schauberger
and the Nazi experiments which culminated in the Kugelblitz flying machine.

Then we have the Airship sightings in the 1800's, in the United States and
other countries, as well as reports of 'flying men' and 'bat-men' who flew
through the air as if swimming.  Charles Fort also collected some reports on
these types of sightings of flying men and machines well before the advent of
the Wright brothers.

All this leads us to believe that there are people who are aware that gravity
CAN be controlled to a degree sufficient to reduce the weight of a given mass.

Over the last few years, several other pieces of information have been added
to the database that give us inspiration for experiments.  The essential
information comes from;

   1)  the principle of inertial drive to produce a unidirectional thrust
       a)  Cook and Thornsen have developed similar systems to produce such a
           thrust
       b)  the devices generate a cycloidal motion to produce this thrust
       c)  Chernetskii uses an electronic version of this technique to
           generate power from a plasma
       d)  the reaction occurs not against the medium (air, earth, water,
           etc.) but against the mass of the object itself
   2)  the 'ZPE as Inertia' paper by Haische, Puthoff and Rueda
       a)  describes how the ambient aether/ZPE is the source and cause of
           inertia
       b)  by properly interferring with this flow, inertia could be avoided
   3)  the Aspden Effect
       a)  a spinning mass was brought to a specific RPM several times and the
           energy required was always the same, 300 joules
       b)  when the mass was slowed ALMOST to a stop, then brought back up to
           the specified RPM (3250), it only required 30 joules of energy
       c)  the rotating mass was not reported to have been weighed in this
           preliminary test

These three essential pieces of information, derived from modern ideas and
experiments show us that aether/ZPE flows can be interacted with in such a way
as to be useful in modern day life.

The aether, being suffused into mass, can be dissociated or decoupled to
various degrees, leading to phenomena such as weight and/or inertial loss.

Did the ancients who built the pyramids and other such structures have access
to hidden technological advanced devices.  Apparently not, since Leedskalnin
did not, yet he duplicated many of their feats in our time, all the while
claiming that he had re-discovered how the Egyptians had built the pyramids.

Once you reduce the 'weight' of a mass, you could move a large stone around
like a piece of styrofoam, or swim through the air, jump over a building, etc.

All indications point to an understanding of basic phenomena which we
currently overlook.  This includes the use of sound or other energies,
properly introduced into mass, to interfere with the aether flow.

Using the concepts outlined above, KeelyNet and some of its associates feel we
could produce a gravity reduction experiment that anyone could duplicate and
this should be possible within a year or less.  It would take some funding to
provide the time, material, equipment and backing to generate and document the
effort.

This file is being generated not for the express purpose of seeking funding,
but to offer everyone access to our observations as to the most likely
approach to achieve a practical means of gravity reduction.  Based on the
information that comes into KeelyNet, it appears the concepts are out there,
but little is being done in the way of practical research.

It does not matter WHO rediscovers how to reduce the flow of gravity, all that
matters is that it is FREELY SHARED with the world.

The intent is to put the pieces in front of everyone so they will get as
excited as many of us are when realizing just HOW CLOSE we are to a world
where gravity is controllable.
