Hello to all a.s.p.n-t regulars. I have been thinking where can I check
something out all night, when it suddenly occurred to me this may well be the
perfect place.  There will be hard core scientists who post here.

O.K. well the first part of this will cause you all to roll eyes skywards I
know, but please bear with me.

In the sense that I tune in frequently and post very occasionally, I am a
regular on alt.alien.visitors. As you can imagine, that group is full of
people who either believe or want to believe in e.t's and lots of debunkers. I
admit up front that I belong to the former group. As you can also imagine, the
group has been abuzz with the screening of the Roswell incident pretty much
world wide last week, and this 'abuzz' has followed the usual pattern of the
group.

However, yesterday appeared a post dated 5 September 1995 from a James
Stephens, entitled 'GroomLake "Colonel" Reveals All'  Now I don't know what,
who or where Groom Lake is, but I have never seen a post from someone called
James Stephens previously, although there could have been because I have only
been participating since early June. There was no reaction in the group to his
post yesterday, but there may well be today because most of the posters are
northern hemisphere, so they don't show up until the next day here in
Australia, and I haven't checked yet, I decided to post here first.

O.K. this guy James Stephens claims to have worked on the B2 bomber and its
more advanced cousins in the Air Force for twenty years. He says that not only
has there been contact between NASA and aliens, there has been and is advanced
experimentation going on with alien technology.  He gives a few pages of very
technical and very scientific detail of this. I will give just a very small
selection of some of the things he says.

He starts off with a statement 'Excitation and accelerated time, less inertia,
gravity, and mass, are one in the same thing. Ships may travel hundred of
times faster than light without time dilation, and energy needed for this is
very little.  Communications are also FTL.'  The following is some snippets
from the long detailed section that follows: 'Some crafts we have do use
electromagnetism to nullify gravity,.....................(science detail)

This is a relatively simple and straightforward effect. And it is what
Einstein was attempting in Project Rainbow. We desperately wanted radar
invisibility. The Air Force feels it has nothing to worry about because nobody
would believe these things.........based entirely on relativity and simple
elegromagnetic laws.  (Lots more scientific detail)......(pages of it)  Ships
can travel faster than light. Time may be accelerated by excitation four
times. Then when we travel close enough to light, the ship simply regains the
mass or time it originally had, but it is travelling four times faster than
light when that happens.

(lots more) ......NASA's SETI is complete rubbish, coverup at its wrost. They
scan at one to ten gigahertz. No alien transmission occurs above a hundred
cycles and NASA knows this.........(lots more)

....Aliens have given clues along the way. After we conducted THE PHILADELPHIA
EXPERIMENT we were contacted......'Anyone wishing to know how our ships ae
powered would have to realize electrons cross what would in their terms be
millions of lightyears of space, and they leave in their wake a magnetic node,
or vortex.

....(loads more) In summary, the public has been misled contemptously.
.......(more)...Perhaps the United States government has reasons for keeping
this secret, but they are not in my opinion good ones...

O.K. you can see my problem, as a member of the I think and hope it's true
group, this seems so exciting. However, I have read enough scathing debunking
to not get my hopes up too much.  Plus, the whole letter could be deliberate
bullshit. I am no science buff, and can't hope to glean whether there is
anything in this.

So here it is, if one of more of the regulars here could and would check this
out and respond either here or there, as to the validity (if any) of this
posting, I would be exceedingly grateful.

Thanks in Advance

GroomLake `Colonel `Reveals `All

    I tell how:

  *  Excitation and accelerated time, less inertia, gravity, and mass, are one
     in the same thing.
  *  Ships may travel hundreds of times faster than light without time
     dilation, and energy needed for this is very little.  Communications are
     also FTL.
  *  EEG waves from one to sixty cycles ARE telepathy, but they come from fast
     time, so they are compressed in time or bandwidth.  Ordinary radios are
     not quick enough to detect the information.  All we detect is this 60
     cycle signal at lightspeed but information inside travels faster than
     light.   And an ordinary radio will reveal the signal when in an excited
     state.
  *  Man left to himself dreams of a paradise where technology and nature are
     in perfect harmony, where he is immortal and free of disease, needs, and
     wants, and this can be done directly from mind to product this very day
     using lightlines.

    As someone who has worked on the B2 bomber and its more advanced cousins
in the Air Force for twenty years,  I can tell you the whole story is
unbelievable.  Twenty hours is too conservative a time estimate for complete
explanation.  Some crafts we have do use electromagnetism to nullify gravity
and even extract hidden information from EEG waves, but these are not deployed
and will not be until they are needed.  They pump electricity from inside
themselves into a sheet of electricity some distance away, exactly as the
earth is positive "ground" and the ionosphere a negative sheet.  This sheet
bends parallel radar waves around the craft like a water droplet in a rainbow,
or just like the ionosphere bends radio waves, making for long distance
communications.  This is a relatively simple and straightforward effect.  And
it is what Einstein was attempting in Project Rainbow or the Philadelphia
Experiment.  We desperately wanted radar invisibility.  The Germans were
engaged in the same effort fifty years ago.   But electric vacuum, the vortex
field, also causes excitation of atoms in it, which shifts waves in frequency
and accelerates time.  I am willing to reveal all I know about these things
in full detail here.

    The Air Force feels it has nothing to worry about because nobody would
believe these things, even though they require no special admission but are
based entirely on relativity and simple electromagnetic laws.  First,  I tell
how electrons are controlled in electromagnetic fields using physics and
Maxwell's equations.  Then two systems are given for establishing a "permanent
excitation" in a volume.  The practical system uses a magnetic vortex and weak
static field.  Next temporal effects are described by contrasting how people
in gravity and then excitation fields perceive quanta.  Then FTL travel and
communications are discussed, as well as how EEG waves are telepathy, but
information is compressed in time or bandwidth.  By the end you will see there
is much more at stake in the government keeping this secret than gravity
alone.

   There are three fields we can use to set up such an "electric vacuum" with
external electric sheet.  These are

    (1) static
    (2) AC and
    (3) PDC magnetic fields

and we need a description of electromagnetics to understand these.  Imagine a
permanent magnet with north pole out of your monitor.  Its flux can be
imagined as a large number of X marks on your screen.  An electron moves in
the plane of the monitor from left to right.  As it cuts flux Lorentz force F
= qvB deflects it downward.  The electron actually spirals clockwise with
radius r = mv / qB, with B in teslas and all other measures in MKSA units.  If
the electon came from opposite direction it would spiral same direction, or
clockwise as we see it.

   Lorentz force derives from static magnetic fields when there is relative
motion between the field and electron.  No force is felt when motion is
parallel to magnetic flux, only when flux lines are cut.  And this static
field performs no work.  The relevant Maxwell equation here is curl E = -
dB/dt, and since tesla density is static here, dB/dt is zero, curl E is zero,
and the field is by definition conservative.  No work is done on electrons, so
we deduce electrons spiral but maintain the same velocity or kinetic energy.

   Static electrons can also be accelerated by magnetic fields.  In that case
curl E is nonzero and we see electrons must absorb energy, or be accelerated,
by the time-variant magnetic field.  This case is actually the same as the
above case, but as current changes in the coil flux expands or collapses from
the coil.  There is still relative motion and electrons still experience the
same Lorentz force.  For example, sending pulsating instead of direct current
through the same coil in the same direction causes the same spiraling effect
on static electrons as the static field had on moving electrons.  Sending AC
through causes periodic reversals of electrons.  The field around the coil can
be given by E(r,t) = 1/2pir*dF/dt, where F is flux in webers.  The electric
lines form concentric circles about the coil, and another way to say this is E
= f * B, where f is frequency in cps, B is average tesla density of a periodic
current, and E is volts per meter close to the coil.  These three fields,
static, AC, and PDC make for any manipulation of electrons.

   There are two ways to produce the sheet.  Both require pumping electrons
from inside the ship into a sheet of electricity.  The first does this from a
central magnetic pole.  A strong static magnetic field is set up, and PDC is
sent oppositely through the pole to set up circular electric lines about it.
Electrons are accelerated circularly about the pole and as soon as they move
they experience an outward centrifugal deflection qvB.  Each electron which
leaves the center of the ship creates a positive hole, and so there is also an
internal electric centripetal field F = knqq/rr, where n is the number of
electrons removed to the sheet.  Each electron has potential energy - kq/r,
and the ship has the same potential energy, so it is excited, because
excitation is the only way matter absorbs electric energy without heating.
Also, one may view removing an electron from an atom as "exciting it past
ionization potential."  The problem here is electrons are limited to speed of
light, and one may assume they gain lightspeed or close to it instantly in any
tangible electric field (by v=Eqt/electronmass provided collision time is high
enough).  Thus speed of light acts to limit qvB centrifugal force and so limit
power in the field to around 40 megajoules, very marginal.

   Another better way is to use a four-coil, two-phase ring, exactly as in
two-phase AC motor stators.  Its field is in every way that of a real rotating
permanent magnet.  Imagine such a magnet in the plane of your monitor.  We can
show flux cuts electrons in such way Lorentz force creates unidirectional
electric lines through the monitor.  That is, electrons are blown through the
screen as air molecules are blown through a circular fanblade.  Now suppose we
set up the same magnet as above, a coil into the monitor.  Its magnetic flux
is perpendicular to that of the rotating magnetic field.  Electrons are sucked
from in front of the monitor, but since they are limited to lightspeed they
enter the static field only so far before assuming a circular orbit through
Lorentz deflection.  Electrons are pulled from inside the ship parallel to
static lines, but when they begin to cut static lines just below your monitor
screen they spiral out to the same radius as above.  Without velocity greater
than light they can go no farther.  So lightspeed, once our enemy, now means
we can put almost any energy into the field we wish.  No energy is lost in the
field except by collisions, which are minimal at higher electric frequencies,
and zero in vacuum.  Field density is a function solely of magnetic vortex
frequency and tesla density, or electric field strength in volts per meter.
The stronger this electric field the more electrons are stripped from inside
the ship and more dense the electric sheet becomes.   Very little energy is
needed at higher frequencies to produce sheets dense enough to bend light,
even with its high frequency.

   Note here an oblate spheroid sheet of charge is formed which may become
very dense.  Anything in it will be heated electrically.  Inside there are
powerful electric fields, though these are no more dangerous than the 10 kV/m
field under a thundercloud, and there is no internal Joule heat because
electrons are held outside the ship.  Charge in either hemisphere rotates
opposite to that in the other hemisphere.  This can be seen by considering
Lorentz force.  Electrons entering the static field from outside are deflected
one direction.  Those leaving the static field from inside are deflected in
the opposite direction.  This bears similarities to Coriolis force, and if so,
so be it.  Let this be indicative of a gravitational connection.

   We find this field also accelerates time, which can be seen as decreasing
gravity,  mass, or inertia through relativity.  One way to view this is as
follows.  A ship near light has its time slow, and this may happen so much the
universe dies in a blink of these peoples' eyes.  Since time is slower one may
say they see more cycles per second and frequencies are shifted up.  But this
does not happen.  Instead, they are not quick enough to perceive as much
information as we do.  So according to Hartley's law their incoming
frequencies and bandwidths are compressed.  People outside, on the other hand,
see these people moving extremely slowly so more information is available to
them, and they see bandwidth and frequencies boosted.  This is only a relative
effect, because quantum energy is conserved, and so real information and
frequency of light are constants when absolutely figured.  But different
temporal and excitation levels of the observer obviously change frequency
perception.

   Excitation causes shifts opposite to gravity.  For instance, if atoms are
excited electrons are farther from nuclei, and under less electric force.
They are more loosely bound.  Now incoming quanta of the same hv energy cause
greater transistions than before, and so appear to have more quantum energy or
frequency.  Waves from inside seem to be high in energy but low in energy or
frequency to people outside.  Again, like gravity, this is a conservative
field, affecting only perception.  However, its shift is opposite to
gravity's.  Since gravity's effect on frequency derived from slowing of time
what effect other than accelerating of time does excitation derive from?  Note
here excitation does not have to cause actual transistions to higher orbital
to give frequency shift effects.  Given Schrodinger wave constraints such is
not possible.  With electric vacuum suction on electrons incoming quanta still
take less energy to cause transistions.

   The main problem we had was finding means for excitation without
relaxation, which normally releases all stored energy in ten billionths of a
second.  Energy required for any significant frequency shift is enormous.
Setting up a weak static magnetic field allows a sort of resonance effect,
where massive amounts of energy are absorbed by the field without release.
Excitation and resonance are only obtainable when relaxation is eliminated as
it can be in the magnetic vortex system.

   What uses are this?  Ships can travel faster than light (FTL).  Time may be
accelerated by excitation four times.  Then when we travel close enough to
light, the ship simply regains the mass or time it originally had, but it is
travelling four times faster than light when that happens.  Thus any star in
this or any other galaxy are within reach without time dilation and with very
little energy input.  Remember, NO supplemental energy is needed in vacuum due
to infinite collision time.  Another way to view FTL travel is the people in
the ship may accelerate to 200 meters per second in their seconds.  Someone
outside has four seconds for one of theirs, so the ship seems to them to
travel at 800 meters per second to an external observer.

   Faster than light communications are also possible, but not without another
effect.  Suppose we emit a 1 to 60 megacycle signal from a field where time is
accelerated one million times.  This is possible because energy required
decays exponentially for faster times.  The signal leaves and shifts down to 1
to 60 cycles.  Anyone outside sees only this  60 cycle "magnetic wave"
travelling at light.  The information inside is compressed in time or
bandwidth.  But it does penetrate water and other matter very well.  Another
antenna in the same one million field expands bandwidth, or is "quick" enough
to get at the original information.  This again shows the interconvertibility
of time and bandwidth.  And EEG waves from one to sixty cycles contain more
information than presently thought.  The reason for FTL propagation is the
same as a stationary observer looking at light in a lightclock on a
relativistic ship.  Light seems to travel faster in this ship and since
Einstein took lightspeed to be constant, he saw time must slow on the ship.
But this gravity field makes light travel faster relative to the temporal
state of the stationary observer (ref INSIDE RELATIVITY by Mook and Vargish).
In our case, the signal travels a million times faster than light because
gravity outside the ship is a million times greater.

   Aliens do exist, but the public is taken for granted  (to put it mildly).
NASA's SETI is complete rubbish, coverup at its worst.  They scan at one to
ten gigahertz.  No alien transmission occurs above a hundred cycles and NASA
knows this.  They are all compressed in time, like subspace communication on
Startrek.  Nothing else has comparable efficiency.  Light takes perhaps
fifteen minutes to reach another planet, but is all but instantaneous with
compression.  EEG wave telepathy is another coverup, even though brain-related
signals have never been detected anywhere else on our spectrum.  By mutual
exchange of information links can be made through lightlines, which convey
force, energy, or information even through walls.  This gives complete control
over reality itself, and it is hard to overstate its importance. Communication
with the dead, and eternal life are easy, so too manufacturing directly from
mind to product.  Truth be told this planet will be socialist, but only when
matter is so ridiculously easy to manipulate anyone who says "pay me" will
have to mean it as a joke.  Telepathy is only thought from fast time, or
excitation field (as in the brain), while matter is only thought frozen in
slow time, or gravity field; but since gravity and excitation are one spectrum
there is no separation between mind and reality, life or death.

   Aliens have given clues along the way.  After we conducted THE PHILADELPHIA
EXPERIMENT, we were mailed a book THE CASE FOR THE UFO: ANNOTATED EDITION with
quotes written in the margins by philosophical aliens who said: "Anyone
wishing to know how our ships are powered would have to realize electrons
cross what would in their terms be millions of lightyears of space, and they
leave in their wake a magnetic node, or vortex, as this one thing is variously
called.  Realizing this, as Einstein did, it makes it clear how matter may be
made into energy, dissolute, or invisible."  This book as well as George
Adamski's INSIDE THE FLYING SAUCERS were required reading for us in the Air
Force.  Other truthful sources are found in THE FLYING SAUCER READER by Jay
David who said: "You wonder how our ships operate.  They operate in resonating
electromagnetic fields, just as planetary bodies do." and BEYOND EARTH: MAN'S
CONTACTS WITH UFOS by Ralph and Judy Blum, who said "The ship is powered by
reversible electro-magnetism.  Reversing magnetic and electric energies allows
us to nullify gravity and control matter."  The greatest source of information
is Adamski's book though.

   Taking these sources as accurate would have been all the public would have
needed to come to the conclusion excitation nullifies gravity.  Look at it
this way.  If gravity can be electromagnetically overcome, which is our only
practical way to ever hope to overcome gravity anyway, gravity has to be
electromagnetic.  Then it must be acting on some electric or magnetic property
in matter, due to concept of dual poles.  Otherwise no electro-magnetic force
could be coupled.  This reduces the problem to finding the one magnetic or
electrical property intrinsic to all mass, because gravity acts on all mass.
Diamagnetism is that universally intrinsic property, but even that is related
to distance of electrons from nuclei by formula for magnetic moment M=IA, or
moment equals current times looparea.  This does not tell whether proximity to
or distance from nuclei is antigravity, but directly suggests that
correspondence exists.

   In summary, the public has been misled contemptously.  They have told you
aliens are not visiting the Earth and do not exist.  Rather than spacecraft,
people are seeing the whole planet Venus fly across the sky.  Then they start
an "effort" to find signals from intelligent beings, which they have already
detected below 100 cycles.  There have been signals picked up even on the
frequencies they scan for, but all signals aliens normally use are below 100
cycles and can never be picked up with conventional equipment.  Finally comes
the ultimate insult.  The world can be better than science fiction has ever
dreampt of, with devices to beam information directly into brains for virtual
reality, access information from any source, which would make the internet
pale in comparison, derive energy from the sun through its lines, and
literally construct anything as if by magic.  Everyone on this planet who has
died since 1967 did not have to, the only cure for AIDS, cancer, and
particularly genetic diseases lies in these lightlines.  This is what the
public is being kept in the dark about.  Perhaps the United States government
has reasons for keeping this secret, but they are not in my opinion good ones.
Ultimately it is not the Air Force's problem the public does not presently
enjoy these things, if you know what I mean.  To be heard one has to make some
noise.
                                                        Sincerely,

   Is it odd not how doctor Wilst could say what he did?  Hasn't anyone out
there read George Adamski.  Little wonder with the government conspiracy and
Lee Harvey Oswald.  Too little time, Atlantia waters warming, polar ice caps
melting, weather changes, nude beaches, coverup, pole shift inevitable....
INEVITABLE.

   In sum, we reach all stars in this galaxy easier than governers want us to
know, but they know as Einstein did.  And same EXCITATION accelerates time and
allows FTL travel, communications, and upward frequency shifts to boot.  Now
surpise: aliens transmit invariably below 100 cycles despite bandwidth
information constraints, because their waves are compressed in time itself,
and EEG waves from 1 to 60 cycles are telepathy we have never found.  Ordinary
radios in "electric vacuum" fields pick it all out as broadcast, and there are
means I know to raise body frequency and use telepathy / clairvoyance in two
hours mentally, but all things minds can do machines do and vice versa because
there is no division but our belief between realms.

   Something simple as orbital excitation nullifies gravity and speeds up
time.  Three mind-stretching proofs:

   (1) Since our only practical means to nullify gravity is electro-magnetic,
       gravity must be electromagnetic and due to concept of dual poles acts
       on an electrical or magnetic property of mass.  The only universally
       intrinsic EM property of mass is diamagnetism, but even this is related
       to distance of electrons from nuclei (ie; excitation) by magnetic
       moment M=IA.  This logical or Greek method.

   (2) Permeability and permittivity are directly propor. to distance of
       electrons from nuclei, thus allowing external magnetic and electric
       fields to more easily distort excited orbitals and store energy in the
       atom.  But according to Maxwell's Wave Equation speed of light is
       determined by one over squareroot of permeability times permittivity in
       ANY spatial region.  So excitation must affect speed of light just as
       relativistic gravity speeds light.  This EM refract method.

   (3) A ship near light has slow time, or great gravity / mass, than one
       static.  So people inside see the universe die in the blink of an eye.
       How can they be quick enough to get as much information as we get?  And
       does this not through Hartley's Bandwidth=Information Law suggest
       bandwidth AND frequencies have been divided by tau time-dilation?  Aha!
       This clear and present danger ironclad proof.

   Now an excited atom.  Its electrons are farther from nuclei, under less
electric force, and incoming quanta of same E=hv  quantum energy or frequency
now cause greater transistions than in unexcited atoms.  So person in an
excited field perceive incoming waves as higher frequency, and several waves,
boosted in bandwidth or information content as well.  Hartley's
Law===>bandwith=information.

   So since gravity compressed bandwidth by slowing time, excitation here must
be accelerating time, or converting mass into energy.  Here we see excitation
overcomes gravity, mass, and time in not one but THREE independent proofs with
yet another coming later.  But consider great potential use.

   There are several uses for this.  A ship of hydrogen excited into n=2
orbital.  Time accelerates four times using E=hv calculations.  It can now go
four times faster than light before regaining its original gravity or mass!
Proxima Centauri is one year away.  But this takes 1o eV per atom.  With only
3.6 eV more we totally ionize hydrogen (ie; frequency shift it to infinity).
Thus we are not limited by distance or time in travel as Relativity suggests,
because energy needed is not linear but exponentially decays for higher
speeds.

   Or another application based on frequency shift.  We have never picked up
telepathic signals, but have picked up EEG waves at 1 to 6o cycles.  If these
enter an excited region they shift up in frequency (or relatively perceived
quantum energy), expanding bandwidth, and baring their original information
content, beautiful like goat's milk.  This is surprises.  Thought reigns as
physical as we are, but it operates from faster time; likewise, matter is only
thought frozen in slow time.  Thus we shall be using a mental energy before we
can reach the nearest star.   This paragraph alone has significant
implications because

    (1) machines can be built to control reality directly
    (2) the human mind from my experience can produce these fields when
        certain rites of gestured belief are performed and
    (3) if brains produce energy for such great downshift energy to travel
        between stars must be meager indeed.

   All these things derive from excitation, a simple quantum mechanical
occurence, but how do we produce excitation without heat or normal 0.01
microsecond relaxation?  Means to produce permanent electric vacuum is needed,
for as long as the field is applied.  This can be done using two-phase four-
coil system (precisely as in AC motor stator but higher frequency) to create a
rotating magnetic field.  An orthogonal static magnetic field then limits
electron flux to spherical surface some distance from ship, which adds
potential energy to these electrons (and contrawise the ship).  There is no
heating of crew because electron flux is outside ship but they are exposed to
high electric fields as under thunderclouds.

   Earth operates in such magnetic vortex.  It explains the earth's positive
ground charge, its negative ionosphere layer, and Coriolis force.  The last is
explained because Lorentz deflection in above electric vacuum system is in
opposite directions in north and south fieldsphere hemisphere, so electrons in
different hemispheres revolve in opposite directions about the ship.  High
frequencies are needed to provide sufficient voltage and increase collision
time for electrons so energy is not wasted.  Again electrons are responsible
for inertia, causing water to lag in different directions in different
hemispheres.  The electric sheet has force and inertia but the ship does not.
And this is another proof for antigravity.

   Yet another use presents itself.  The ionosphere bends radio waves
depending on their angle and frequency because they travel at different speed
through this highly charged region.  This was alluded to in permeability and
permittivity.  Why not create such intense field around a ship parallel radar
or light rays are bent around the ship, like water droplets in a Rainbow.
This could be done if the field were intense enough and right distance from
the ship.  And it is invisibility, though anyone in such fields could escape
faster than we perceive, because their time is faster.  The science is sound
(more or less).

   Then what are we waiting for!  Let's go find Adamski's Firkon of Mars and
ask directions to the nearest starbase.  I have plenty more rolling around in
my head, and will readily go into fine technical detail in any area
aforementioned.  Give me feedback, most if not all is too technically
abbreviated here to realize without more depth discussion.  They said I was
too unstable, and kicked me out of prison because of my theories, but now my
views are sared.  Join me and the other ben men of the universe to build a
better tomorrow on planet Saras.  And E-mail me at tgrpwe@ix.netcom.com.
