Hi,

Today I was at a meeting of the Berlin, Germany based Workshop for Decentral
energy research lab.

Their head physician Berhard Schaeffer now finally has found the solution to
build a machine that proves, that the second "law" of thermodynamics is not a
law at all, but can be overcome with his special Retrograde Condensation
experiment !

Mr. Schaeffer has build a measurement apparatus, that contains a gas mixture
of 90 % CO2 (carbondioxide) and 10 % N2 (Nitrogen).  This gas mixture is at a
pressure level between 55 to 85 bar and if you measure the pressure versus
volume diagramm at 26 to 29 degrees Celsius you can see, that there is a
positive circular process, which can convert just heat to mechanical energy on
a 100 % conversion process !

This is a heat engine that just needs a hot pole but no cold pole.  Heat is
converted directly to mechanical energy. Carnot equation is dead !

By using this retrograde condensation process it is now possible to build
engines, that just cool down their environment and run on their own energy,
like ships that cool down the seawater to propel themself!  Or think about a
refrigerator that does not need any electrical power to run, but just
generates electrical energy and cools down the food inside it !

Now, after this success in the prototype measurement unit, we need support to
build the final prototype engine to show the effect to the world and to the
many sceptical people, who say, this can't be done.

We need your help. Please try to contact us and let us know, how you could
help to make this engine come true. As we don't get any funding from the
normal research funds we need urgently funding from independant supporters and
we need other universities to verify the results.

Mr. Schaeffer has put about 30 years of his life into this thermodynamic
research and has spent all his money on this invention, so please try to help
us to make it come true.

Please call directly Mr. Bernhard Schaeffer at:

++49 30 802 23 02  (voice)   or
++49 30 821 62 88  (fax)

That's in Berlin, Germany.

Or you can send an email to his son Kai Schaeffer at:

schaeffer@krypta.snafu.de

In January, I will have my new Free Energy WEB server online and then I will
have a full description of all this technolgy and his measurement results
online.  Stay tuned for more !

Regards, Stefan.

I find this very interesting since I had reported here about a year ago that a
scientist at a government lab in Oak Ridge reported that there is similar open
diagram (ie. positive circular process) for steam at higher pressures.

Perhaps this is not as uncommon as one would think.  I had proposed this
effect could be responsible for the excess reported with the Griggs device
last year.
