                        VACUUM ENERGY: A BREAKTHROUGH?

                              By Andrei Samokhin

The model of a plasma generator which can convert physical-vacuum energy into
electricity has been developed under Prof.  Alexander CHERNETSKI at the Moscow
Georgi Plekhanov Institute of the National Economy.  Such generators could lay
the groundwork for the future environmentally-benign power industry.

Classical physics cannot explain what happens when a plasma discharger placed
in the Chernetski circuit is started: for no apparent reason the ammeter
pointer shows triple strength-of-current increase [sic] and energy output is
several times above input.  The plant's efficiency is much more than 1.

No magic is intended.  Additional energy outputs at specific plasma discharges
are fixed in several independent expert reports by the Lenin All-Union
Institute of Electrical Engineering.  This effect has been checked by
different methods.

Whence this mysterious energy?

Self-generating discharge
-------------------------

Prof Chernetski, the author of the first ever study paper on plasma-
diagnostics equipment (he has been in this field fro 40 years now) and 20
inventions, never knew what he was probing into specific unstable plasma
states at strong-current discharges could have led to.

In the early 70s, he and fellow-researcher Yuri Galkin worked on a basically
new type of high-frequency plasma generator which could at high power do
without unwieldy energy converters.  In one test, they discovered input-output
energy gap. [sic]

   "I knew electron drift begins in plasma and sought to deduce a combination
    of variables in which fluctuating plasma instability emerged in
    discharge,"

Chernetski says.

   "Gas discharge was meant to serve as a powerful stimulator of
    electromagnetic modes and, all of a sudden and in defiance of the law of
    conservation of energy, a strange energy imbalance was produced.  Repeated
    experiments with different circuits proved energy output to be always
    greater than input."

The mysterious discharge stimulating additional energy extraction was called
the "self generating discharge (SGD)".  Measurements showed that part of the
discharge power went back into the network as if two series-connected
electromotive forces were at work.

In a bid to try to explain the experimental data, the researchers actually
tried to prove the impossible.  One of their proofs was very "strong".

The one-megawatt substation of the Moscow Aviation Institute, where Chernetski
and Galkin were staging an experiment with a powerful plasma unit, burned out.

When the dischrage currents reached criticality, superstrong current was
"born" in the generator and went back into the network, playing havoc with the
safety devices calculated for short-circuit.

Later on, they read in books that earlier in the century the power plant of
prominent Yugoslav electrical engineer Nikola Tesla caught fire under similar
circumstances in the United States.

Chernetski and Galkin were sure that Tesla was making such experiments, but
did not publish the results.  They are also sure that vacuum energy can
explain this mysterious effect.

A Vacuum-Powered Lamp

The researchers relied on the present-day quantum physics idea of "zero-point
oscillations" in physical vacuum.  Such oscillations signifying the birth and
annihilation of virtual pairs -- the particle and anti-particle, distinguished
from the normal elementary particles by a negligibly short life, a mere 8.10/-
21[sic] sec.

Emerging below the zero energy level from "nothing" and returning to
"nothing", virtual particles appear to defy the law of conservation of energy.

Quantum electrodynamics explains this paradox through the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle.  Under it all the precise particle characteristics
cannot be learnt simulatneously and, therefore, one must not require from
nature "punctual" abidance by the law during such a short time as the life of
virtual pairs.

The observer fails to notice anything, while every virtual pair is more than
real, carrying an energy of more than half a million electron-volts during its
lifetime.  The potential energy in the electric bulb vacuum is enough to boil
the earth's oceans, Americans John Wheeler and Richard Feynman have
calculated.

Until recently the vacuum energy idea was only a daring hypothesis bordering
on science-fiction.  The lamp powered by vacuum in Chernetski's basememt
laboratory in the center of Moscow made it a reality.

This is how he explains his miraculous experiment:

    "The self-generating discharge emerges when the discharge current reach a
     definite critical density, when the magnetic fields they create ensure
     magnetisation of plasma electrons and they begin to perform mostly
     cycloid movements.

     The interaction of currents with their magnetic fields forces the
     electrons to deviate to the cylinder-shaped discharge axis and the
     electrical field emerges.  It has proved to 'switch on' the physical
     vacuum: in this field the vacuum is polarised and consequently the
     virtual pairs begin to move in a definite direction, instead of
     chaotically.  the virtual positrons accelerate plasma electrons, giving
     them part of their energy.

     The current in the circuit builds up and additional energy is discharged
     on the resistor switched into the discharge circuit.  Clearly, only part
     of the tremendous vacuum energy is extracted.

    "We've developed several circuit versions which can find application.  In
     the later experiment with an input power of 700 watts, that extracted by
     the generator loads resistance was three kilowatts, or nearly five times
     more.

     This is by far not the limit and with more powerful plants and the
     corresponding calculations megawatts of free electricity can be produced
     from a minimal power source."

Self-Generating-Discharge Plasmatron and Space Travel

Yuri Galkin looks at the future of their discovery:

    "Its applications are wide-ranging.  For example, engines based on the
     self-generating-discharge plasmatron.  Until now all attempts to use
     plasmatrons as engines failed, because strong electron and ion
     bombardments rapidly burnt out the electrodes.

     Self-generating discharge leaves them intact and such engines can be used
     in aircraft, trains and autos.  It would be logical to create a new
     environmentally-wise power industry.  Portable hydros, wind power plants
     and solar batteries boosted by self-generating discharge could become an
     enormous source of electricity.  With time, they could edge out the
     costly and hazardous fuel-firing and hydraulic [hydroelectric?]
     facilities.

     Already now we can build a plant which would supply electricity for a
     township or factory.  A vacuum power station comparable to giant
     facilities could be designed today.  Our discovery can revolutionise
     cosmonautics."

Laboratory experiments have proved the possibility of using the kinetic effect
of self-generating discharge for accelerating bodies in space.  Galkin has
calculated the parameters of a self-generating-discharge plasmatron that could
serve as the propulsion engine of the future, replacing the present unwieldy
rocket engines.

Powered by a minor ten-volt source, it can deliver power enough for the
takeoff of a large spaceship.  Tapping the ambient space vacuum, it could fly
eternally.

Unknown Waves

"We didn't think of only industrial applications," Chernetski recalls.

    "Self-generating discharge turned out to produce wave radiation which was
     hitherto unknown, but evidently existent at all times.  Like sound waves,
     its waves have a longitudinal electric field component and a high
     penetrability through condcutive mediums, including metals.  It turned
     out that these single waves, 'awakening' the hidden vacuum energy, can
     alster substance structure.

     The experiment staged at the Burdenko Institute of Neurosurgery in Moscow
     several years ago showed that directional SGD radiation accelerated
     nuclear beta-decomposition by 5%-6%.  This is only one example.

     We supposed that, like SGD-generator radiation, longitudinal electric-
     field component waves could also be produced by living beings, man in
     particular.

     Comparative experiments were staged to prove the impact on men with
     extrasensory perception and of our device on different objects.  In both
     cases parallel impact on the high-stability quartz generator made its
     frequency 'drift' by several orders of magnitude.

     The filament resistance of the incandescent lamp decreased considerably.
     Probably we are on the road to explaining such mysterious things as
     extrasensory perception, telekinesis and bioenergy.

Vacuum-Ether

The experimentally-verified concept of Chernetski claims to be a theoretical
breakthrough in the basic quantum-physics idea of the energy structure of the
Universe.  It is generally recognised among physicists that all elementary
particle interactions, and hence every existing phenomenon, occur with the
help of virtual-particle exchange.  How does it come about?

    "Full annihilation of virtual pairs cannot take place in the event of
     partial energy extraction in self-generating discharge, because a
     'certain' virtual dipole must emerge -- two separate charges with a
     common negative energy.  This means that together with energy extraction
     vacuum structurisation and ordering takes place.

     Actually, our concept is a return to the idea of the universal ether at
     an entirely new level.  We say that the ordered dipole vacuum, or ether,
     is an all-penetrating energy medium in which processes occur which are
     related to virtual dipoles and subject to the uncertainty principle of
     modern physics."

Chernetski asks: If vacuum structurisation is a constant process, isn't this
an opportunity to state the law of conservation of entropy in the Universe in
opposition to the idea of its steadfast decrease?

What if this work helps to clear up the nature of gravitation, which is as dim
now as it was in the times of Newton?  What his concept of the vacuum shows
is the road to the long-awaited explanation of the Grand Unification theory?

    "As as experimental physicist I won't say our theory is 100 percent
     correct," Chernetski declares.  "It's much more an opportunity now to
     have indisputable experimental data to prove the opportunity of creating
     a basically new power industry."

Only a rapid switch to new energy can save human civilisation from ecological
catastrophe.  The research program must be developed immediately and a center
set up to coordinate cooperation between world scientists.  Natural and
unlimited vacuum energy is at our doorstep.
