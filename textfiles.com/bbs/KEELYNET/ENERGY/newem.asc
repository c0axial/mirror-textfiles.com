            The article  was  printed  in  the  American Society of Dowsers
                    newsletter and is how it appeared therein.
       Dan says Indy races take BIG BUCKS  to get into, so if this is true,
       someone has some pull or backers with lots of resources.  Discussion
       with other associates remember the entry of turbo-charged  cars into
       Indy which resulted  in  banning  that  type  of entry in subsequent
       races.  No one knew the restrictions  currently  in  effect for Indy
       races so whether or not this kind of car will be allowed  is  up for
       grabs.

       Fuel Free Engine

       (the following article,   from  the  March  edition  of  OMEGA,  was
       submitted by Bob McKusick.  The subject is of particular interest to
       dowsers because of its "scientifically impossible" nature.)

       Veteran Arizona politician Sam Steiger predicts that a revolutionary
       new ELECTRO-MAGNETIC engine will  be  introduced  this year.  In the
       December 31 issue of the Prescott Courier, the controversial  former
       U.S. congressman and  recent  candidate  for  governor  said the new
       engine "will change the course of  man  everywhere  on  the  planet.
       This engine will  rank  with  fire,  the  wheel,  and  the  internal
       combustion engine as a shaper of man's destiny."

       Writing in his  own  column,  Steiger  said,  "The  engine  will NOT
       require fuel, recharging or batteries  to  provide  the  energy that
       drives it.  The oil business will be relegated to the  supply needed
       for the manufacture of plastics, lubricants, and hydraulic fluid."

       "Air travel will  be  revolutionized  because  of its new lower cost
       fares.  High speed trains will not  be  driven  by diesel but by the
       new engine, and will ride on a magnetic field instead of directly on
       the track," he predicted further.

       He claimed that a near-utopia will be created as a result of the new
       engine.  "There will  be  no  more  nuclear  power   sources  needed
       (submarines or electrical  generation)  and the huge hazardous waste
       disposal dilemma becomes manageable."

       "Since the motor will be manufactured  ONLY  in  the  U.S.", he said
       there would be an improvement in the economy.

       Stieger did not  go into detail AS TO HOW this engine worked but did
       say, "This motor  EXISTS NOW.   I  am  a  very  small  part  of  its
       development.  Plans are  being made to enter TWO CARS  in  the  1992
       Indy 500 that  will be driven by these motors.  We are doing this to
       assure that this motor is NOT BURIED,  as  so many other advances in
       energy production have  been  buried  or  pooh-poohed   out  of  the
       market."

       "This will all  happen  in  1992.   This  is  not a guess, these ARE
       FACTS.  There will surely be attempts  made  by  industries that see
       themselves as directly impacted negatively to suppress this advance.
       They can't."

       Vangard Notes...

           Speculation??  Have we heard this before but not quite so bold?
           So what is the basis of this new miracle motor?   Arizona  as  a
           base state, eh?  Now who worked out in that area and the general
           West in the area of engines?

           Well, E.V. Gray died about 2 years ago and he had a phenomenally
           efficient EM engine but it did not power itself.  We at KeelyNet
           and Vangard  Sciences  as well as the majority of our associates
           suspect that  the  miracle  technologies   of  the  future  will
           NECESSARILY be HYBRIDS of different researches.

           Also, the Joseph Papp engine which used a mix of  recycled inert
           gases.  When  mixed and exposed to a high voltage discharge, the
           gases provide an explosion to  separate  the  mixed  gases which
           recombine at   another   stage  of  the  engine.    There   were
           indications that such an engine could provide its own electrical
           power and  being a closed system, require no fuel.  It is not by
           definition an electro-magnetic engine, however.

           My guess would be a combination of the E.V. Gray motor with some
           kind of ZPE vacuum tapping,  possibly  using  a  barium  ferrite
           mechanism as  used  in  the Floyd Sweet device.   Unfortunately,
           this is  the  first  (and  only) piece of info to date regarding
           this project that we have seen,  so  we  would  greatly  welcome
           further info as would our users and associates.
