                                On Michael Faraday
                              by Waldemar Kaempffert

       I (Faraday) once  showed  Mr.  Gladstone  how  an induced current of
       electricity could SPIN  A  LITTLE   COPPER   DISK  WITHOUT  TOUCHING
       ANYTHING.

       "What's the good  of  that?"  he asked.  He was a practical  man  of
       affairs, and I was not.

       So I gave  him a practical answer, "Some day you will be able to TAX
       IT," I said.

       I believe that the practical man  is  OFTEN  VERY  IMPRACTICAL.   He
       wants an invention  or  discovery  that will work -  that  is,  MAKE
       MONEY.

       But the time  comes  when  the  invention fails to meet a new set of
       conditions, so that  the theorist  must  step  in  and  explain  the
       failure and suggest a theory out of which some really practical good
       will come.

       No experiment is worth much unless it is explained by a good theory.
       Great inventions always spring out of good theories.

       I never had  a  systematic education.  As a pupil  in  a  local  day
       school, I learned no more than the rudiments of reading, writing and
       arithmetic.  But I  read  much, especially when I was apprenticed to
       G. Riebau, a kindly bookseller.

       By chance I attended four lectures  delivered  by  Sir Humphry Davy,
       made careful notes,  transcribed them neatly, bound  them  and  sent
       them to him  with  a  letter in which I expressed the hope that with
       his aid I might forsake trade.

       To my astonishment he found a place for me in the Royal Institution.
       There I remained to the end of my days.

       I belong to a small, despised Christian sect called Sandemanians.  I
       believe with them that it is futile  to  bring  religion and science
       into harmony.

       Religion is based  on  FAITH,  science on REASONING.  I ask myself :
       Why am I here?  SCIENCE cannot answer.

       It is not concerned with PURPOSE.   But  religion  IS concerned with
       purpose, and what that purpose is must be a MATTER OF FAITH.

       I believe that without faith man would drift helplessly - that love,
       sacrifice, truth would have no meaning.

       All told I   have   performed  about  2,000  experiments.    Without
       experimentation I am  nothing.   Not  one of my many experiments was
       performed with a PRACTICAL PURPOSE IN VIEW, though many proved to be
       of INDUSTRIAL IMPORTANCE.

       I never patented anything.  I foresaw the uses to which my discovery
       of electromagnetic induction might  be  put,  but preferred to leave
       its APPLICATION TO OTHERS.

       In my earlier years at the Royal Institution I had  to  eke  out  my
       slender salary with  outside work and in that way made a few hundred
       extra pounds a year.

       I soon gave this up.  It is not too difficult to make money if there
       is SELF-DENIAL AND INDUSTRY.  To me  money-making  was an UNPLEASANT
       DISTRACTION.

       It always took my mind off the work that I WANTED TO DO.

       But what was that work?  As I look back at it I see  that it was the
       QUEST OF TRUTH.

       I know that a scientist has no way of recognizing truth when he sees
       it.  But the QUEST GOES ON AND ON.  It must go on.  Without it there
       would be no SCIENCE.

       Suppose that science  had  succeeded  in  creating  a  living  man -
       something that could be accepted as  a counterpart of the men we see
       about us.

       And suppose that this creature could think as we do.   Unless it was
       concerned with the  TRUTH it would never be a REAL man, never a real
       SCIENTIST.

       That much I learned in my experimentation.   I believe that THERE IS
       SOMETHING in the world of experience THAT IS INTENT ON TRUTH.

       The RESPONSIBILITY of the SCIENTIST is a responsibility  to SEEK AND
       PROCLAIM the TRUTH AS HE SEES IT.

       We do not PATENT truths.  We GIVE THEM TO OTHERS.

       It is because   giving  is  part  of  their  creed  that  scientists
       constitute a world-wide intellectual fraternity.

       Religion may PREACH the BROTHERHOOD OF MAN; science PRACTICES IT.

       The lesson is  not  always heeded.   I  believe  that  mankind  will
       prosper the more it WIDENS AND DEEPENS the SCIENTIFIC HABIT of mind


                                      Page 2





       and that the  greatest  of  all  problems  is  that  of  making this
       scientific habit more EFFECTIVE.

       As that scientific mind is acquired  there  will  be  more  and more
       giving.  I BELIEVE in GIVING.

       By giving I mean MORE than presenting a single precious discovery to
       the world.  I mean that NOTHING MAY BE WITHHELD - not  even  a crumb
       of KNOWLEDGE.

       Morse would not have invented his telegraph, (nor Tesla his rotating
       magnetic field motor),  nor  Bell his telephone, nor Edison his many
       electrical contrivances had it not been for MICHAEL FARADAY.

       He was probably   the  GREATEST  EXPERIMENTER   that   ever   lived.
       Electrical engineering as we know it BEGINS WITH HIM.   When  he did
       his work, which  was  largely  in the first half of the last century
       (1800 - 1850), there was not even an electric doorbell.

       There were only TWO SOURCES OF ELECTRICITY.   One  was  the electric
       machine with glass plates that had to be rotated and rubbed with fur
       to produce electric sparks; the other was the battery.

       Faraday was not only an experimenter but a theorist.   As a theorist
       he ranks with   Newton   and   Einstein.   He  belonged  to  a  very
       materialistic period; yet  he   was   a   spiritual   force  in  the
       development of science.

       A devoutly religious man, his profound belief in the  spirit  played
       as much a  part  in  his  scientific  success  as  his skill and his
       industry.  As one of the most distinguished  scientists of his time,
       he made scores of experiments and observations.

       His crowning achievement, the one that enabled society  to pass from
       steam to electricity,  was  the  GENERATION  OF  ELECTRIC CURRENT by
       moving magnets and  coils of wire  relative  to  each  other  -  the
       PRINCIPLE OF THE DYNAMO.

       Faraday lived from  1791  to  1876.   One would call  him  the  most
       remarkable bookbinder who  ever  lived,  for he was trained for this
       occupation and actually practices it for a little while.

       Then at twenty-two  he  unexpectedly   was  appointed  a  laboratory
       assistant of the  Royal  Institute  of  Great  Britain  through  the
       influence of the eminent chemist Sir Humphry Davy.

       Soon he was  to  spend  two  years traveling through Europe with Sir
       Humphry, and he promptly began making his important discoveries.

       Right away he  discovered  two   new   chlorides   of   carbon   and
       successfully liquefied several gases.

       By the time  he  was  thirty  he published a sketch  of  history  of
       electromagnetism and in  that same year effected the revolution of a
       magnetic electric needle around an electrical current.

       He went on to discover the effect of one current on another in terms

                                      Page 3





       of their deflection  and  attraction, and the characteristics of the
       electrical current produced when a  magnet  is inserted in a coil of
       wire.  It was this that led to the development of the  MAGNETO,  the
       DYNAMO and the GENERATOR.
