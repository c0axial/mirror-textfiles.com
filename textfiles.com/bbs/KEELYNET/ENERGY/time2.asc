                         Playing fast and loose with time:
          a new study suggests that time travel is not quite impossible.

                               by William F. Allman

       Time travel has popped from the annals of science fiction into the
       realm of scientific respectability at least in theory, that is.

       By combining two well-established principles originally outlined by
       Albert Einstein nearly a century ago in his theories of relativity,
       three theoretical physicists  have  proposed  a  novel  scheme  that
       appears to permit a limited sort of time travel.

       The scientists' result is not anything  close  to  a  blueprint  for
       building the sort  of time machine that science-fiction  heroes  are
       forever leaping into  to  explore the lives of cave men or peek into
       the future.  But it suggests that  either  Einstein's  equations are
       wrong or that  the  universe  is  governed  by some  very  different
       principles from what physicists have long assumed.

       The notion that the causes of an event taking place in the present
       could be eliminated by traveling into the past and changing history
       has always made physicists (not to mention stock speculators and
       newspaper publishers) squeamish about the idea of time travel.

       Physicists have thus  held  that  there  must be laws that provide a
       kind of "cosmic censorship" that prevents  moving  through time, and
       thus any tampering with the sequence of events.  Various theoretical
       scenarios for time travel have been cooked up in  the  past,  but in
       each case physicists have found physical laws that blocked it.

       The new study, however, appears not to violate any known physical
       laws.  "We're asking, if you take Einstein's equations far enough,
       will they get  you  in  trouble?"  says  Michael  S.  Morris  of the
       University of Wisconsin, one of the co-authors of the new study.

       "We're suggesting that maybe they will, because at some level we may
       have to abandon either Einstein or  causality" - the basic principle
       of physics that one event Time flies.

       The authors' hypothetical  time  "machine"  starts  with  Einstein's
       famous, and apparently  paradoxical,  discovery  that  time  is  not
       constant throughout the universe, but rather varies depending on the
       velocity at which the timekeeper is traveling.

       While to an  astronaut, a clock on board a speeding  spaceship  will
       appear to tick  at a normal rate, to a stationary observer on Earth,
       the clock will appear to be marking time very slowly.  This apparent
       slowing of time applies not only to  clocks but to everything in the
       spaceship, including the astronauts, and has given  rise  to what is
       known as the "twin paradox":

              When the speeding astronaut returns to Earth, he will
              have aged LESS than a twin brother he left behind.

       This bizarre time-slowing    effect   has   been   demonstrated   by
       researchers who synchronized two highly  accurate  atomic clocks and
       then flew one of the pair aboard a high-speed jet for  hours.   When
       the two clocks were reunited, the airborne clock had fallen slightly
       behind its stationary twin.

       The second Einsteinian principle that goes into the time machine is
       the warping of space by gravity.  This idea is often explained by
       analogy to a worm crawling over a sphere.  To the worm, the world is
       flat.

       Crawling from one  spot on the sphere to another in what seems to be
       a straight line,  the  worm doesn't  realize  that  it  is  actually
       tracing out a path that curves in three-dimensional  space to follow
       the sphere's contour.   The  worm also doesn't realize that it could
       take a shortcut by burrowing through the core of the sphere.

       Similarly, what appears  to  us  as   three-dimensional   space  is,
       according to Einstein's  theory  of relativity, bent  in  dimensions
       that we cannot  easily  imagine,  and a "wormhole" could connect two
       seemingly distant points in space.

       To turn a  wormhole  into  a  time   machine,  say  the  physicists,
       technicians in some   "arbitrarily   advanced"  civilization   could
       harness the gravitational  forces  necessary  to make one end of the
       hole move back and forth at extremely  high  speed while keeping the
       other end stationary.

       Like the astronaut in the twin paradox, this rapidly  moving  end of
       the its stationary  counterpart.  By entering the "older" end of the
       wormhole and coming  out  the  "younger"   end,   a   person   could
       theoretically travel from the present to the past.

       Keeping the door open.  While the physicists' calculations suggest
       there's nothing to prevent all this from happening,  they admit that
       no one has actually ever seen a wormhole.

       Calculations by Morris  and co-authors Kip Thorne and Ulvi Yurtsever
       of the California Institute of Technology  imply that a wormhole can
       be kept open only under some strange and exotic physical conditions.

       Phenomena that under   normal   circumstances    exist    only    in
       infinitesimally small particles for infinitesimally short periods of
       time would have  to  exist throughout the wormhole for as long as it
       remained open.
                                      Page 2





       Even if a  wormhole  time  machine were possible, it wouldn't permit
       the kind of time travel fancied by  H.  G. Wells and others who have
       mused on the possibility of traveling far into the past or future.

       Even though members  of an advanced civilization might  be  able  to
       cause one end  of  a  wormhole to age less slowly than the other, at
       best they would only be able to make time stand still at the instant
       the tunnel was created, not move it  back any further into the past,
       and they couldn't move the other end ahead into the future.

       There's at least  some circumstantial evidence that  the  more  far-
       reaching kind of time machines envisioned by science fiction writers
       will never be  created,  even  by  the most technologically advanced
       civilization imaginable.

       If such a machine were ever to be  built, a traveler from the future
       probably would already have shown up here by now.
