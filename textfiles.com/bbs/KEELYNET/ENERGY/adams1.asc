                   The Adams Pulsed Electric Motor Generator
                        a free energy machine at last?

                                THE REAL MCCOY

It is with great excitement, and appreciation to the inventor, that Nexus
publishes the following information on the Permanent Magnet Electric D.C.
Motor Generator of Robert Adams, a former Chairman of the Institute of
Electrical & Electronics Engineers, Inc., U.S.A., (N.Z. Section).

After having his invention suppressed for over 20 years, Mr Adams, at the age
72, has decided to share his design with the world regardless of the
consequences.  Mr. Adams' quest to bring "free" energy to the world has cost
him dearly as it has many other researchers who threaten to bring the
"establishment" undone.

He has survived an attempt on his life by an individual affiliated with the
New Zealand Secret Intelligence Service and the Central Intelligence Agency,
direct suppression of his invention by former (and recently deceased) Prime
Minister of New Zealand, Robert Muldoon, the giant British electronics
company, Lucus Industries, as well as numerous other insurmountable
difficulties that have been placed in his path. All because his invention
worked.  And not only that, it is so simple, any electronics manufacturer or
skilled backyard-home-scientist could build one.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               INVENTORS BEWARE!

In 1978 Mr. Adams discovered that inventors of machines or devices of high
energy efficiency capability ("Free" Energy) are not only refused patents, but
that in most cases, their inventions are classified under the "Military Use
Clause", which is, of course, international. Inventors are prohibited from
publishing details of their devices or promoting them in any manner of their
invention is classified under this clause. In other words, their devices
automatically become the sole property of the "establishment".

The fact that there is an established mechanism to suppress energy inventions
of this nature has been a closely guarded secret for many years.  Many
inventors have made such claims, but the general public remain oblivious to
the fact that they are being deprived of clean and free energy by
organisations that would rather make money and hold power over the public,
that allow such technology to become widely available. Yet another example of
the abuse of power. (No pun intended.)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 "FREE" ENERGY

This motor generator would be called a "Free Energy" machine by most
individuals. It is, in fact, a device that converts the perpetual motion of
sub-atomic particles, known in physics terminology as "particle spin", into
conventional electric power. It is a widely accepted fact of physical law
that sub-atomic particles are in a state of perpetual motion. Anybody who
tells you that there is no such thing as perpetual motion is either ignorant
or a liar. As Robert Adams states, "Our universe is a sea of energy - free,
clean energy. It is all out there waiting for us to set sail upon it."

Adams has built a number of permanent magnet electric D.C. motor generators
based on the principle outlined in this article, some of which have
demonstrated an electrical efficiency of 690% and a mechanical efficiency of
620%. The devices run at room temperature. Any device that doesn't could not
be running at over 100% efficiency, as heat is the major result of hysteresis
losses that are induces in any conventional electric motor or generator.
Radiated heat is a sure-fire sign that a power generator is not running over
unity, as all heat radiated by such a device is wasted energy.

I will remind readers once again at this point that Mr. Adams in not a fly-by-
night, propeller-head, whacko, techno-boffin. He is an electrical engineer
with over 60 years experience in the field of electrical engineering, which
has included designing and building equipment for use in power stations,
broadcasting facilities, airport communications centres, etc. He is a former
Chairman of the Institute of Electrical & Electronic Engineers, Inc., U.S.A.,
(N.Z. Section), and his resume includes personal referees ranging from a
former New Zealand Commissioner of Police, a former Chairman of Air New
Zealand, (and several technical specialists from the airline), as well as an
Ex-NASA scientist.

Nexus would recommend to anybody interest in, or presently building a device
of this nature, to try building a device based on Mr. Adams plans.  His
machines have demonstrated the ability to generate free energy, unlike most of
the theoretical models that are promoted as over-unity devices.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The invention may be broadly said to be, an electric motor and/or generator
comprising a rotor consisting of a number of radially arrayed permanently
magnetised poles, and a stator consisting of a number of radially arrayed
permanently magnetised poles, together with a number of wound poles.

The rotor's permanently magnetised poles use ferrite magnetic cores, and may
comprise any even number of poles. The stator's wound poles employ steel or
iron cores.  The device is essentially a D.C. machine, but may be fed A.C.
input with the use of a solid state converter.  The Rotor uses a number of
similar polarity permanent magnetic poles, i.e., all-south or all-north.

A further set of wound poles are radially arrayed in the stator, and are
arranged in such manner as to be fed energy, that is excited by back E.M.F.
energy, from the poles of the rotor. Associated circuitry is provided to feed
the energy back to the drive poles of the motor.

The resulting characteristics of this design is that once the rotor is moved
from the position of equilibrium, each pole is attracted to, or repulsed by
the stator poles, but at a precise geometrical point with respect to them, the
input current to the drive coils ceases.

As a result, the collapsing field current is in the opposite direction to the
applied force, thus reversing the magnetic polarity of the stator coils. This
forces the rotor poles away (reaction), which is the instantaneous response of
a system to an applied force, and is manifested as the exertion of a force
equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction to the applied force.

Pulsing the D.C. input current, overcomes losses generated in conventional
motors. According to classical electrical engineering theory, efficiency is
greater the more nearly equal the Back E.M.F. (electro-motive force) is to the
applied voltage, i.e. the lower the input current.

Figure 6 shows that there is minimum 100% back E.M.F. relative to the supply
source on input D.C. voltage (according to classical electrical theory), which
virtually depicts a sine wave due to the effect of the collapsing field.

This effect also overcomes the electrodynamic torque problems associated with
conventional motor designs. (As input power varies with the duty cycle pulse;
i.e. the lower the input current, the lower the input current, and the lower
the speed, the greater the torque.) At clip-off, the back E.M.F. ceases, the
collapsing field takes over, opposing the outgoing rotor magnet and thus
increasing momentum.  With this design force is applied twice during each D.C.
pulse, with pulse-on, and with pulse-off.

The timing of the pulses are determined by the dimensions of the motor itself,
i.e. the speed of rotation of the motor's central axle, the position of the
rotor magnets in relation to the stator windings, as well as the distance that
the rotor magnets travel when passing across the poles of the stator windings.
          (See accompanying diagrams ADAMS1.GIF through ADAMS6.GIF).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATIONAL NOTES

Important Factors

  1) Care must be exercised when assembling and wiring the drive windings to
     make sure that their polarities match the rotor magnet polarity.
  2) Common earthing must be avoided in order to preclude voltage and/or
     current loops. (IF a number of drive windings do need to be commoned, use
     very low resistance conductors and employ a transmission type earthing
     system only).

Stator (Drive) winding resistances are your choice. Robert Adams' machines
were built varying from 0.03125 to 27 ohms per set. He has experimented with
two, four, and eight pole machines. Efficiency increases with the number of
wound poles in the stator.

Motor generators with a single, two, or three phase can be built to this
design. A number of rotors may be ganged together on the same shaft in order
to increase power output and does not require the use of any commutator,
brushes or slip rings, all of which contribute to energy losses in ordinary
motor generators.

Unlike conventional Series D.C. machines, this motor can be off-loaded, finds
its own speed, and will run at that speed indefinitely. A conventional DC
motor will run itself to destruction with off-loading. It requires no cooling,
nor any overload protection, even if short circuited.

A number of highly qualified individuals have seen these devices running and
producing energy at well above 100% efficiency. Let's hope that some of you
can achieve similar results.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   GENERAL CONSTRUCTION AND TESTING PROCEDURES OF THE ADAMS MOTOR GENERATOR

An ideal drive winding pole can be very readily available by obtaining some
B.P.O. 3000 type relays (ex Telecom). Simply remove present winding, cut core
in half, re-thread, assemble and fill with winding. This is a quick and cheap
method of obtaining a very high quality non-retentive steel core.  As
aforementioned, winding resistances used by the inventor varied between
0.03125 to 27 ohms.

The above windings described are ample to drive prototypes even in a 180
degree application. You will find speeds up to 2500 rpm with only two of these
windings 180 degrees apart - no problem.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
For AC Output Coil Windings and Core.

Ideal cores can be built cheaply and quickly by dismantling a spare power of
audio transformer and utilising the "I" section laminations, obtain winding
former to fit same and it is ready for winding. Turns and gauge will depend on
what voltage and current you choose. Remember, at this stage, you should only
be building a demonstration model, so to speak.

After a few changes, corrections and/or general modifications you will be
ready to put a mechanical and/or electrical load on the machine. For an
electrical load it is suggested you firstly wire up a bank of 6 - 12 LEDs.
If everything is go, then switch over to torch lamps: Later on with a bigger
machine - car lamps, or maybe household lamps and a mechanical load
simultaneously.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
For Efficiency Testing

Milliamp meters are useless for this machine - do not use for testing.  Use
only high quality digital true RMS meters, with input power, for high
accuracy, use ONLY a high quality electronic wattmeter: These instruments
measure extremely accurately any wave-shape. A good twin-beam oscilloscope is
a must: So too a high quality electronic temperature-measuring instrument with
appropriate probe.

Drill dead centre of one or both cores, as per drawing. Probe must be good
fit. If, after one hour of running on load and temperature is around 40
degrees, that will indicate things are most likely working correctly.

Don't forget your ambient in Australia will be considerably higher than ours.
Read the inventor's rotary and solid state efficiency measurement data sheet.

Rotor-stator air gap is not critical, but the closer the better.

As stated elsewhere, the stator pole faces, if desired, may be reduced to 25%
of the rotor pole face area, hence large drive windings and high drive current
is not required.

With care to detail, correct mathematical calculations and high quality
instrumentation correctly utilised, incredible results can be expected.  Study
data submitted shows those results have been attained on several machines.

Temperature of conventional machines internally reach boiling point after
fifteen minutes running. Check Adams Motor Generator after running on full
load for 48 hours, or after fifteen minutes if you prefer not to wait that
long. You will be very pleasantly surprised - I refer to maximum loading
conditions, not free running.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mechanical Loading Test:

A high quality strain measuring instrument must be used in the universal "pony
brake" method of mechanical load testing.

RPM tests must also be obtained with a high quality tachometer and/or
oscilloscope reading and use the universal equation to calculate mechanical
machine efficiency.

Note: Very Important Factor:

As you increase duty cycle, current input will increase and efficiency will
decrease. From random test sheet results I have chosen it is very clear what
to expect upon increasing duty cycle.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note:

The Adams Motor Generator is so efficient, so simple and consequently it's
construction is such that is surpasses overwhelmingly anything before it, thus
lending itself admirably to mass production.

One of a number of unique features of the Adams Machine is the fact that the
same rotor poles are utilised simultaneously for driving the machine and
generating output energy.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Construction Equation - Adams Motor Generator - 20/12/76

It was found, after considerable development work, that maximum electro-
magnetic effect produced in the stalloy stacked generating pole windings
occurred when the dimension of the mating end of the stacks were four times
greater in area than the rotor magnet's pole area. Hence the overall design
of the machine incorporates this derived ratio of one to four. (The Adams
Equation, as applies only to the Adams Machine).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feedback - 20/12/1976

The feedback, produced by the output generating coil, produces a polarity
reversal normally resulting in large eddy current losses in conventional
machines, but, in the Adams Machine, it is harnessed to develop further
additional torque to the magnetic rotor. The larger the output generating
coils the greater the torque delivered to the rotor.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Power Factor - 1/7/1976

There is no power factor loss because the Adams Machine runs in a condition of
resonance. Therefore, the Power Factor Loss is zero.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

             THE ADAMS PULSED ELECTRIC GENERATOR - The Conspiracy

I have for many years been waiting the opportunity to make a start on writing
about my life as an electrical engineer and inventor, but have been reluctant
to do so because of the possible reaction from one formidable individual who
was instrumental in causing me untold frustration, ridicule, anxiety,
financial problems, and health decline.

With the passing of Rob Muldoon, I now feel more deposed to exposing what he
and his regime subjected me to, and the possible subsequent valuable loss to
our country as a result.  I personally had a meeting with Muldoon and others
at his home office in Tamaki regarding my invention.

The result of the meeting was that he recommended me to the Inventions
Development Authority. In all good faith I duly contacted the inventions
development authority and that folks was the beginning of the saga which was
destined to follow.

The Inventions Development Authority passed me along to DSIR, who at the time
were frantically working on their own energy systems, and assisting Government
with various 'Think Big' projects.

Time rolled on, and DSIR monkeyed me around for several months; there were, as
always, excuses for not proceeding with completion of their strange testing
apparatus to test my machine.

In the meantime, Rob Muldoon appoints himself Minister in Charge of SIS, the
department with world-wide connections to the CIA, ASIO, FBI and Interpol!

I had meanwhile, designed a bigger proving machine and had placed orders
overseas for magnets and devices for pulsing equipment. Time went by, well
beyond expected delivery dates, with no sign of the devices, nor any
correspondence pertaining to my orders to any of the electrical companies.

I lodged person-to-person calls to the people who originally signed the
confirming correspondence to me, to be told that "that person in no longer
with us and we cannot help you any more."

Muldoon had by now, committed the whole country to the New Plymouth Power
Station, Huntly Power Station, Marsden Oil Refinery, etc etc. The Government
signalled its intentions that is was in no way going to let a little outsider
like me come into the act with a revolutionary machine capable of countering
the so-called energy crisis.

Muldoon at this stage, had me well taped up so to speak, My phone, I was
informed, was tapped, my mail was intercepted and I was kept under
observation.

I held a number of meetings with the Chief Post Office Investigating Officer
regarding the matter of mail disappearance and interception, with the same
negative and unsatisfactory answers and results as from other Government
departments. After the lapse of several months, the machine was finally
evaluated by DSIR.

I must mention here an interesting fact regarding the evaluation of my machine
by the DSIR. It happens that a certain electrical engineer that I was involved
with, who incidentally, also evaluated my machine, informed me that the person
designated the role of evaluating my machine in DSIR, was in fact a mechanical
engineer with no background, knowledge, nor qualifications of any description
pertaining to electrical or electronic engineering, and further that the
Auckland Division did not posses a member on the staff qualified to undertake
such a project. This person none-the-less did do the evaluation and indeed
signed the test results.

(You may well wonder how did this independent electrical engineer have such
inside information on the DSIR? Well, it so happened that he himself had been
their one and only electrical engineer in the Auckland Division, and I might
add, a specialist on electrical motors too.)

That an unqualified person was assigned the task of evaluating the
possibilities of a revolutionary motor is further evidence to me of
conspiracy.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    DSIR Evaluation - 5.8% efficiency
    Lucas Industries Evaluation - 100% efficiency!

Other independent eminent engineers' findings, including those of the ex-
electrical engineer from DSIR varied from 96.93% to 100% efficiency!

At this stage, I had unwittingly invited the then chief departmental district
electrical engineer to be present at my laboratory to witness the phenomenon
of one particular model displaying identical input and output wave forms on a
twin beam oscilloscope with the machine windings running at ambient
temperature, a condition which cannot be denied as proof of 100% efficiency,
without any further tests being required.

He conceded there was no doubt whatever what he was witnessing was real, but
like all academics who stick to their ivory tower scientific establishment
beliefs, he said it could not be done.

Upon reading certain of my writings, it will be found that at one time in
earlier years, I disbelieved in any kind of conspiracy regarding inventions
pertaining to energy efficiency, and certain communication installations. I
must now say, having unwittingly got myself into the web of the insidious
conspiracy, through treading the path of an inventor in the field of free
energy, that I now know from personal experience the pitfalls, stone walls,
and blatant obstacles and barriers designed to hamper and silence inventors
with such devices as energy efficient machines.

I decided to investigate the fate of a number of other excellent energy-
efficient inventions, and learned that too many good inventions were never
heard of again. Inventors themselves were turning into hermits, meeting with
unexplained accidents, even totally disappearing. In many cases their
laboratories were searched and ransacked, equipment confiscated and/or
destroyed, and even attempts made on their lives. Others are frequently bought
off in return for silence.

The conspirators, who are also the cartel operators are determined to continue
to make mankind use fossil fuel for all possible energy requirements and will
go to any lengths to achieve just that.

I have since superseded the above machine and have built and proven two
different types of self-sustaining motor generators with efficiency ratings
well beyond unity.
