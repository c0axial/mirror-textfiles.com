       26.  Energy should  not be  defined as  the capacity  to do work;
            that  is   wrong.     Accomplishing  translational  work  is
            something that can be done by dispersing energy (order), but
            that is not its definition.

            Energy is  any ordering,  either static  or dynamic,  in the
            virtual particle flux (VPF) of vacuum.

            Work is  just the scattering of energy __ the disordering of
            this VPF  order.  Note that the present definition of energy
            used in  physics thus  is a  statement that  "order  is  the
            (capacity to  do) disordering  of order."  In that form, the
            illogical aspects of the statement can be seen.  It is still
            correct, however,  to state that "energy has the capacity to
            do work.   Certainly,  if you scatter or disorder the order,
            you will have disorder.  With the word "has" substituted for
            "is," the sentence becomes just a statement about energy; it
            is not posing improperly as its definition.  However, it now
            requires that  a new  definition for "energy" be found.  The
            new definition was presented above.

            Electromagnetic energy  is any  ordering, either  static  or
            dynamic, in  the virtual  photon flux  of vacuum.   In other
            words, for  a field  energy, one selects __ for the ordering
            __ only  the type of particle in the VPF that is the quantum
            particle of that field.

            A potential  is any  ordering, either  static or  dynamic or
            combination thereof, in the virtual particle flux of vacuum.
            Note that, according to this definition, a potential is pure
            energy, a  priori.  It is also totally ordered internally __
            which is a new concept for physics.  But we must be careful.
            Because  of   the  nature   of  the  virtual  particle  flux
            comprising it,  the potential  is  a  collection  of  nearly
            individual  virtual   energies  __   a  collection   of  the
            individual energies of a host of individually moving virtual
            particles.   Each particle  is still almost totally separate
            from each  other, most  of the  time.  In other words, as an
            informal  analogy,   potential   is   a   sort   of   mostly
            disintegrated  energy,  which  only  has  just  a  touch  of
            integration, enough  to allow  it to  be referred  to  as  a

                                      Page 1

            single "collection"  or "ordering."    Note  also  that  the
            ordering itself  is an  open system.   Virtual particles are
            continually entering, leaving, or appearing and disappearing
            in it.   The  ordering is  like a  whirlpool in a river: The
            form or  ordering may be stable, but the water molecules are
            continually passing through the stable, ordered form.

            A scalar  potential is  any static  (stationary) ordering in
            the virtual  particle flux of vacuum.  A vector potential is
            any dynamic (nonstationary) ordering in the virtual particle
            flux of vacuum.  Note that both scalar and vector potentials
            have totally  ordered  interiors.    Scalar  potentials  and
            vector potentials are simply different subsets of the energy
            domain.   And notice  that both are simply stable forms in a
            dynamic medium,  like two  swirls in  a river.  So to speak,
            one swirl  is stationary with respect to the observer on the
            bank; however,  internally it  is quite highly dynamic, with
            water molecules  continually flowing  into and  out  of  the
            stabilized form.  The second swirl is moving with respect to
            the observer  on the  bank; however,  internally it  also is
            quite  highly   dynamic  internally,  with  water  molecules
            continually flowing  into and  out of  the stabilized  form.
            The difference  here is  whether or not there is movement of
            the stable exterior form with respect to the observer.  Both
            are open  systems, continually  being supplied  with  energy
            flowing in, and continually emitting energy.  Also note that
            both  kinds   of  EM  potentials  possess  ordered  internal
            Whittaker bidirectional wave structures.

            An electrostatic scalar potential is any static (stationary)
            ordering in  the virtual photon flux of vacuum.  Its ordered
            structure is  an ordered  lattice of  spacetime/vacuum,  and
            consists of  a Fourier  expansion of  harmonic transverse EM
            plane waves, coupled to the phase conjugate of the expansion
            in 1:1  ratio.   Scalar interferometry  between two  or more
            scalar EM  potentials  is  just  the  multiple  simultaneous
            interferometry   of   the   constituent   Whittaker   waves.
            Incredibly         dynamic          interference          of
            potentials/vacua/spacetimes from  all the  charged particles
            of the  universe is  continually occurring  in "the" ambient
            vacuum __  that is,  in the  quantum mechanical vacuum.  The
            quantum mechanical  vacuum concept  is just the modification
            of the classical "empty vacuum" concept to take into account
            the  spontaneous   creation  and   annihilation  of  virtual
            particles, required  by quantum mechanics and the Heisenberg
            uncertainty principle.

            "A" vacuum  is a  spacetime and,  to first  order, a  scalar
            potential.  "The" ambient vacuum is a violently changing and
            interfering collection  of potentials  from moving particles
            all over  the universe; i.e., "the" ambient vacuum is really
            an incredibly  large number  of  conglomerated,  interfering
            vacua/potentials.     The  conglomeration   implication  for
            vacuum/spacetime of  these definitions,  or of  the gist  of
            them, has  previously been  pointed out  by W.  Misner, K.S.
            Thorne  and   J.A.  Wheeler,   Gravitation,  1973,  p.  399.
            Quoting: "...The  terms 'gravitational  field' and 'gravity'
            refer in  a vague,  collective sort  of way  to all of these
            entities.     Another,  equivalent  term  for  them  is  the

                                      Page 2

            'geometry of  spacetime.'"   Our comment  is as follows:  In
            other words, the notion of the geometry of spacetime is also
            a vague,  conglomerated concept,  and it  also must  not  be
            primary, but  must be  composed of  other field  effects and
            things __  which of  course is  Sakharov's  hypothesis  that
            gravitation is  not even  a primary  field of nature, but is
            always due to interactions and effects of other fields.

            The above  definitions are  all precise.   To the best of my
            knowledge, most  of them  have not  previously  appeared  in
            physics in  such an exact form.  To explain why more precise
            definitions are  so  important,  we  quote  a  statement  by
            Einstein: "...the  scientist makes use of a whole arsenal of
            concepts which  he imbibed  practically  with  his  mother's
            milk; and  seldom if  ever is  he  aware  of  the  eternally
            problematic  character  of  his  concepts.    He  uses  this
            conceptual  material,   or,  speaking  more  exactly,  these
            conceptual  tools   of  thought,   as  something  obviously,
            immutably given;  something having  an  objective  value  of
            truth which  is hardly  ever, and in any case not seriously,
            to be  doubted.   ...in  the  interests  of  science  it  is
            necessary over  and over  again to engage in the critique of
            these  fundamental  concepts,  in  order  that  we  may  not
            unconsciously  be  ruled  by  them."    Quoted  from  Albert
            Einstein, "Foreword,"  to Max Jammer, Concepts of Space: The
            History of  Theories of Space in Physics, Harvard University
            Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1969, p. xi-xii.

            Sands, The  Feynman Lectures on Physics, Addison-Wesley, New
            York, Vol. I, 1963, p. 2-4 for a statement that the electric
            field exists  at a point in the vacuum in the context of its
            potentiality for  producing a  force,  should  a  charge  be
            placed at that point.  Maxwell's original theory was modeled
            on a  mechanical ether,  where  the  ether  was  a  material
            medium.   If that  were truly  the case,  then  force-fields
            would exist in the material-ether medium.  Accordingly, they
            were so modeled by Maxwell.  With the subsequent elimination
            of the  material ether,  Maxwell's EM force-in-the-material-
            ether model  was rendered incorrect, but the model has never
            been recast, to this date.

       28.  Calculations of  the energy  density in  the vacuum range to
            enormous values  on the  order of  10exp100 grams  per cubic
            centimeter, expressed  in mass  units.  To convert this mass
            density to  energy density, simply multiply by the square of
            the speed of light.

       29.  Recall again  Feynman's statement.   In the vacuum, one just
            has a  force-field-free gradient  in the potential until one
            places an  observable charge  in  there  for  the  potential
            gradient to  couple to.   With  such charged  particle(s) in
            place, the  local interaction  and coupling of the potential
            gradient with  the charged particle(s) produces (and in fact
            constitutes) an electromagnetic force field.

       30.  Notice that,  considering the  electron gas  as a  fluid,  a
            longitudinal pressure  gradient does  move nearly  instantly
            down the  wire, without  concomitant  electron  movement  as

                                      Page 3

            longitudinal current.   So  the potential gradient does race
            longitudinally down  the wire at nearly the speed c.  In our
            detectors and  instruments, however,  we  still  detect  the
            lateral electron  precession waves,  however.   Obviously we
            need some instruments of greater subtlety.

       31.  For an  explanation of  the electron drift velocity, see any
            good sophomore  physics text.   E.g.,  see  David  Halliday,
            Robert Resnick,  and John  Merrill, Fundamentals of Physics,
            Third Edition  Extended, Volume  Two, John Wiley & Sons, New
            York, 1988,  p. 649-650.  The effective or averaged velocity
            of the  electrons in the electron gas in a copper conductor,
            e.g., may  be about  1.6 x 10 exp 6 meters per second, where
            the electrons  are considered  as free  particles in  a gas.
            However, when an electric field is applied to the conductor,
            the average  velocity of  the electrons down the wire may be
            only about  4 x  10 exp(-5)  meters per second.  This field-
            induced motion  down the  wire is  many orders  of magnitude
            less than  the average  velocity  of  each  moving  electron
            (without respect  to its  direction).   As can  be seen, the
            electrons just  gradually "drift along slowly" down the wire
            on the  average, fully justifying the term "drift velocity."
            Most of  the movement  of the  electrons in the wire is in a
            radial (precession) direction.

       32.  The change  in potential  that travels  down the  wire is in
            fact a change in the intensity of the local vacuum's virtual
            photon  flux   exchange  with   the  atoms   of  the   wire,
            particularly with  their atomic  nuclei.   It  is  this  VPF
            exchange between  vacuum and  nucleus (and  to a  far lesser
            extent, between  vacuum and  the  electrons)  which  is  the
            "medium" for  the true  signal.  Thus the signal is simply a
            traveling   change   in   the   vacuum/atom   VPF   exchange
            "potential", with  only a  slight delay  due to  interaction
            with the  charges in  the nuclei.  The signal is primarily a
            change in  the virtual  state conditions, rather than in the
            observable state  conditions.   However, to  "observe"  this
            signal, the  embedding  or  "coupling"  interaction  of  the
            traveling potential  gradient with  the conduction electrons
            is important.   This  coupling  produces  translation  force
            fields,  i.e.,   acceleration  changes  in  the  translating
            electrons.   We actually  detect these  electron translation
            changes.   In  other  words,  we  actually  detect  electron
            wiggles, and  infer or  assume what  must have  been in  the
            vacuum to interact with the electron gas and cause its waves
            or "wiggles."   It  is strongly  accented that  any detector
            detects only  its own  internal change;  it detects  nothing
            "external" at all.

       33.  Tesla was  adamant that  EM waves  in the  vacuum  were  not
            Hertzian, but  were waves of rarefaction and compression, as
            are sound  waves.   For example,  see Nikola Tesla, "Pioneer
            Radio Engineer  Gives  Views  on  Power,"  New  York  Herald
            Tribune, Sep.  11, 1932.   Quoting:  "...I showed  that  the
            universal  medium   is  a   gaseous  body   in  which   only
            longitudinal pulses can be propagated, involving alternating
            compressions and  expansions similar  to those  produced  by
            sound waves  in the  air.  Thus, a wireless transmitter does
            not emit  Hertz waves  which are  a myth, but sound waves in

                                      Page 4

            the ether,  behaving in every respect like those in the air,
            except that,  owing to the great elastic force and extremely
            small density  of the medium, their speed is that of light."
            In  a   later  article,   "The  True  Wireless,"  Electrical
            Experimenter, May  1919, p.  87, Tesla wrote:  "...The Hertz
            wave theory  of wireless  transmission may  be kept up for a
            while, but  I do not hesitate to say that in a short time it
            will be  recognized  as  one  of  the  most  remarkable  and
            inexplicable aberrations  of the  scientific mind  which has
            ever been  recorded in  history."   Four years  before  E.T.
            Whittaker's  epochal  1903  paper  describing  the  internal
            structure of  the scalar potential as consisting of a phase-
            locked harmonic  series of special bidirectional EM standing
            waves,  Tesla   experimentally  discovered   the   "standing
            potential waves".   On  July 3,  1899  and  on  through  the
            evening into  the morning of July 4, Tesla observed standing
            potential waves  from a  traveling thunderstorm,  even after
            the storm  had traveled a distance of several hundred miles.
            He recorded  this significant  discovery in  his  laboratory
            notes on  July 4,  1899.  See Nikola Tesla, Colorado Springs
            Notes 1899-1900, Nolit, Beograd, Yugoslavia, 1978, p. 61-62.

            In his  magnifying transmitter, Tesla was not depending upon
            ordinary   Hertzian   waves,   or   earth-ionospheric   duct
            transmission of  power.  These would not allow magnification
            of the  power worldwide.   For example, in Nikola Tesla, "My
            Inventions: Part V.  The Magnifying Transmitter," Electrical
            Experimenter, June  1919, p. 176, Tesla stated that "...this
            wireless  transmitter   is  one   in  which  the  Hertz-wave
            radiation is  an entirely  negligible quantity  as  compared
            with the  whole energy."   On  p. 178  of the  same article,
            Tesla stated  that "The  transmitter was  to  emit  a  wave-
            complex  of   special  characteristics..."    In  "The  True
            Wireless," Electrical  Experimenter, May  1919, p. 29, Tesla
            mentioned  his   use  of  a  unique  form  of  resonance  in
            connection with  his wireless  transmission  of  energy,  by
            stating that  one "...must  not view  it  in  the  light  of
            present day  science."   On p.  62 of  the same  article, he
            stated that  his "...transmission  through the  earth is  in
            every respect  identical to  that through  a straight wire."
            For a  direct and  "uncommon"  explanation  of  how  Tesla's
            magnifying transmitter  actually worked,  see T.E.  Bearden,

       36.  Ironically,  a  world-renowned  Nobel  Laureate  __  whom  I
            greatly admire  and with  whom I interacted face-to-face for
            about three  hours __  was completely  unable to  comprehend
            that a  photon carried  time, even though he was quite aware
            that its  dimensions were  energy multiplied by time!  He in
            fact was  adamant that it could only carry energy, not time.
            Many other  physicists have  exhibited the same bewilderment
            when queried  on this  question.   The point is this:  It is
            not, repeat not, the energy of the photon that is quantized.
            It is  the photon's  overall action/angular momentum that is
            quantized.   Making up  the  photon,  the  energy  and  time
            components are  canonical.    For  stable  rate-of-time-flow
            conditions, the energy and time in a photon are discretized.

       37.  Years ago,  we crudely used this to generate a fundamentally
            new definition  of mass,  and also  to explain the mechanism
            for  the   "flow   of   time."      See   T.   E.   Bearden,
            Quiton/Perceptron   Physics:    A   Theory   of   Existence,
            Perception,  and   Physical  Phenomena,  National  Technical
            Information System,  Report AD-763210,  1973.   The paper is
            crude, and  should be  rewritten when possible.  But it gets
            the main  point across.   It  also derives  Newton's laws of
            motion, relativistic  form; the  square law  of gravitation;
            and a  new defining  equation for  mass in  terms of trapped
            action flux.

       38.  Specifically, the  photon  and  antiphoton  actually  differ
            internally.   The photon  is composed  of (+DE)(+Dt),  or  a
            piece of  positive energy  and a  piece  of  positive  time,
            welded together  without a seam.  The antiphoton is composed
            of (-DE)(-Dt),  or a piece of negative energy and a piece of
            negative time, welded together without a seam.

       39.  Maxwell in  fact writes:   "There are physical quantities of
            another kind  which are  related to directions in space, but
            which are not vectors.  Stresses and strains in solid bodies
            are examples  of these, and so are some of the properties of
            bodies considered  in the  theory of  elasticity and  in the
            theory of  double refraction.    Quantities  of  this  class
            require for  their definition nine numerical specifications.
            They are  expressed in the language of quaternions by linear
            and vector functions of a vector."  [James Clerk Maxwell,  A
            Treatise on  Electricity  and  Magnetism,  unabridged  third
            edition, Volume  1, Dover  Publications, New  York, 1954, p.
            10.]   However, even  though Maxwell  utilized a  mechanical
            model of the ether, he apparently never focused on the exact
            internal vector patterning of a scalar stress potential as a
            highly significant,  engineerable property.   On  page 30 of
            his Treatise,  e.g., he shows three figures illustrating his
            conception of  directional actions  at  a  point  in  space,
            involving vectorial convergence, rotation, and a combination
            of the  two.   However, I  have found  no evidence  that  he
            realized the  significance of  the precise  pattern  of  the
            internal vector  structure of  a quaternion multiplication's
            remaining scalar  component when  the vector  or directional
            components  of   that  multiplication  interact  to  a  zero
            translation resultant.   In  other words, I have been unable
            to find  any recognition  by  Maxwell  that  a  zero-vector-
            resultant  translation   system  was   highly   significant,

                                      Page 6

            particularly in its gravitational implications.  However, my
            search of  Maxwell has  certainly not  been exhaustive,  and
            evidence to the contrary may yet be surfaced.

       40.  Maxwell's  theory   is  actually   some  200-odd  quaternion
            equations scattered  throughout his  1873 book.   See  James
            Clerk Maxwell,  A Treatise  on  Electricity  and  Magnetism,
            Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1873.  The third edition is

       42.  There are  at least  two quite  different kinds of zero, and
            mathematics uses  the zero concept in two entirely different
            fashions.   An example  is in  arithmetic.   When we write a
            number, a  zero in  a digit's  position means the absence of
            any digit  there.   It means  the total absence of any digit
            there.   In other  words, it  corresponds to an "empty set."
            We also use the zero standing alone as "the definite absence
            of any  single number."   However,  here there  is  a  great
            difference,  because   at  the   same  time  it's  also  the
            indefinite presence  of  multiple  numbers.    Specifically,
            e.g., 0  = 3  + 2 + (-5), etc.  In our arithmetic operations
            we regularly  replace the  "zero as  absence of  any  single
            number" by  "zero as  the presence of multiple numbers whose
            sum is  zero."   In other words, this type of zero refers to
            absence only of any singular number.  In this zero case, the
            sum of  a group  of two or more numbers that are present can
            be zero,  while the  numbers still  remain.   In vectors, of
            course, the  directions refer  to translations.   So  a zero
            vector need  not be  an "empty  set."   It's an  "empty set"
            insofar as  use of  any single  finite translation vector to
            represent  the   combined   finite   translations   of   the
            interacting vectors.   None  such can  be there, because the
            overall system  doesn't translate.    But  the  zero  vector
            resultant is  not an  empty set  with regards  to the actual
            continued presence  of  the  multiply  interacting  vectors.
            They are  still there  and, if  they represent  forces, they
            produce  a   specifically  patterned   stress,   or   stress
            potential.   A zero-vector resultant system of finite vector
            components, in vacuum, is a specific template and a specific
            vacuum engine  doing continuous internal work on the medium.
            Simply speaking, the total energy in the stress can be taken
            as a function of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of
            the internal  vector components.   Note  that  the  internal
            energy patterning,  however, is  specific both in individual
            magnitudes and  directions.   So for zero-vector translation
            resultant systems,  the system  is a scalar stress system __
            non-translating __ in terms of its total magnitude, but that
            scalar stress  system is  specific in  terms of  its  hidden
            internal translation vector structure.   Also, note that two
            stress systems  can have  identical stress  magnitudes  (the
            same amount of internal energy), but its internal components
            may vary  drastically, both  in  individual  directions  and
            individual energies directed in those directions.

       43.  Tesla considered  that an  electrical charge  was carried by
            the electron, but was distinct from the electron itself.  He
            considered electricity  to be  a fluid thinner than any form

                                      Page 7

            of matter,  with highly  specific  properties  of  its  own,
            completely separate  from matter.   He considered the charge
            of the  electron to be due to a surface layer of electricity
            covering it,  and it  could receive  many layers,  giving it
            multiple charges,  all of  which could  be dissipated.   See
            John J.  O'Neill, Prodigal Genius, Angriff Press, Hollywood,
            California, 1981, p. 249-250.

       44.  For appreciable  curvature and hence use of the vacuum as an
            appreciable EM  energy source  or sink,  one must  alter the
            mass potential  of the atomic nucleus.  In other words, that
            is where  most of  the potential  energy is,  and it  has an
            internal Whittaker  EM biwave  structure which can gradually
            be appreciably  activated and  altered.   See, for  example,
            Ingram   Bloch   and   Horace   Crater,   "Lorentz-invariant
            potentials and  the nonrelativistic limit," American Journal
            of Physics, 49(1), Jan. 1981, p. 67-75.  When the trapped EM
            energy in  the mass  potential is  altered to  a  degree  of
            notable size  with respect  to the  particle's rest  energy,
            ordinary Newtonian  mechanics and  the Schroedinger equation
            may be inadequate, even if v/c is small.

            Fundamentals of Physics, Third Edition Extended, Volume Two,

            Chapter 2  of Peter Galison, How Experiments End, University
            of Chicago  Press, 1987  for a  detailed description  of the
            Einstein-de Haas  experiment of  1915, and  of  the  related
            experiments that  followed it.   Also note particularly that
            the suspended  static magnet  case does  not appear  to have
            been carefully  examined; instead,  almost all  the work was
            with alteration, or change of the magnetization.  I am aware
            of Soviet  work, however,  that flatly  states that a magnet
            carefully  and   axially  suspended  vertically  develops  a
            macroscopic turning  moment.   See again  Halliday, Resnick,
            and Merrill,  p. 1024.   Is  there  a  cancellation  angular
            momentum  that  cancels  the  macroscopic  angular  momentum
            effect?  If so, from whence does it come?  Can it be evaded?
            Think about it.

       46.  Our approach  to scalar EM requires that the value of c be a
            function of  the VPF intensity of the vacuum.  In fact, some
            of the  very best measurements clearly show this fact.  See,
            for example,  Bryan G. Wallace, "The great speed of light in
            space coverup,"  Scientific Ethics, 1(1), Feb. 1985, p. 2-3.
            According to  Wallace's  findings,  significant  unexplained
            systematic variations  exist in  all measured interplanetary
            radar data,  and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is apparently
            forced to  use empirical  correction factors  to uphold  the
            constancy of  the speed  of light.   See also M.E. Ash, I.I.
            Shapiro, and  W.B. Smith,  Astron. J., Vol. 72, 1967, p. 72.
            Direct experiments  on Einstein's  second postulate,  in the
            1961 interplanetary  radar  contact  with  Venus,  challenge
            whether relativity  is correct.   Variations of over 30,000%
            of the  best possible general relativity fit the MIT Lincoln
            Lab could  generate were  measured.  The variations were not
            random but  contained diurnal,  lunar, and  synodic periodic
            components.  See also Bryan G. Wallace, "The Unified Quantum
            Electrodynamic Ether," Foundations of Physics, Vol. 3, 1973,

                                      Page 8

            p. 381.   Wallace  details measurements strongly challenging
            the Einstein  assumption of  the constant velocity of light,
            and deals  with the nature of the ether.  Wallace's analysis
            of such data strongly challenging the constancy of the speed
            of light  in vacuum  has been  largely suppressed by leading
            scientific journals.

       47.  The huge  collection of charged particles in the mass of the
            earth, and  the local  scalar EM  potential  resulting  from
            them, results  in an  ambient vacuum  potential in the earth
            laboratory that  is higher  in magnitude  than  the  ambient
            vacuum potential  in  deep  space  far  from  planetary  and
            stellar masses.   Just as sound travels faster through steel
            than air, light should travel faster in a hard vacuum in the
            earth laboratory than it does in deep space.  Indeed this is
            true.     See,  for   example,  B.N.   Belyaev,  "On  random
            fluctuations of  the  velocity  of  light  in  vacuum,"  [in
            Russian], Izvestiya  Vysshikh Uchebnykh  Zavedenii,  Fizika,
            Vol. 11, Nov. 1980, p. 37-42.

       49.  Thus the probability that a quantum potential will be formed
            between separated electronic systems, etc., is a function of
            the overall  signal density  of the environment, rather than
            specific signal characteristics.  I have previously proposed
            a self-targeting mechanism that directly creates the quantum
            potential, via  the hidden Whittaker biwave EM communication
            inside  the   scalar  EM   potential.    See  T.E.  Bearden,

            91912, 1991,  p. 33-37.  An example of the quantum potential
            effect also  apparently happened  during the U.S. air attack
            on Libya  in April  1986.  See Mark Thompson, "Mixed signals
            may have  misguided U.S. weapons," The Washington Post, Jan.
            22, 1989, p. A4 for a description of the incident.

            are readily  available.   Our comment  here is  that, in the
            graviton theory advanced in this paper, gravitons comprising
            a scalar  EM potential  are  already  linked  spatially  and
            harmonically/subharmonically, to  compose  a  spatiotemporal
            lattice.

       56.  For decades the Soviets induced anomalous health changes and
            diseases  in  personnel  in  the  U.S.  Embassy  in  Moscow,
            utilizing microwave  radiation.   Studies by  Johns  Hopkins
            researchers established  that the  anomalous health  changes
            only occurred in personnel located in areas that had zero EM
            force fields.   In other words, they occurred only where the
            potentials __  if any  __ would have been gradient-free, and
            hence persistent, and without bleed-off.  Specific Whittaker
            structures introduced  into the  persistent potentials could
            directly  account   for  the  results,  a  la  Kaznacheyev's
            cytopathogenic effect.  Note that, in nonlinear systems, the
            phenomenon  of   nonlinear  resonance   would   imply   that
            subharmonics of  the specific  Kaznacheyev  optical  signals
            from  damaged   cells  could  be  utilized  to  produce  the
            cytopathogenic effect.   In other words, microwaves could be
            utilized to  produce the  same results.   See  T.E. Bearden,

            working with  some of  the finest French medical scientists,

            leukemia,  sleeping   sickness,  etc.   can  be  cured  with
            unorthodox  electromagnetics.     This   was  not  anecdotal
            material,  but   rigorous  scientific  experiments  properly
            performed and  reported in the French medical journals.  For
            a complete  resume of  the Priore  affair,  see  Jean-Michel
            Graille,  Le  Dossier  Priore,  De  Noel,  Paris,  1984  (in
            French).   For a substantial synopsis, see Christopher Bird,

            Machine: A  Scandal in  the Politics  of Science,"  in  T.E.

       58.  As an  example, one eminent French scientist who worked with
            Priore was Dr. Robert Courrier, then Secretaire Perpetuel of
            the French Academy of Sciences, and also head of the Biology
            Section of  the  Academy.    Courrier  personally  presented
            Priore's  astounding   results  to   the   French   Academy.
            Pautrizel was  also another  eminent  French  scientist  who
            extensively worked  with Priore, and wrote several technical
            papers on  the results,  and these papers are printed in the
            standard French medical literature.
