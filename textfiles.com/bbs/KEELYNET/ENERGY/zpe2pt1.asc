             THE DEVELOPMENT OF POST-RELATIVISTIC CONCEPTS IN PHYSICS
                      AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY ABROAD (PART I)

                            Rolf Schaffranke, Dr. h. c.
                                  Member A.I.A.A.

       "Far more is done to the progress of science by skepticism than by
       gullibility". (Dr. Wood,    Director   R   &   D,   McDonnel-Douglas
       Astronautics Div., CA)  NASA - Langley  Research  Center in Hampton,
       VA is named after Samuel Pierpont Langley (1834-1906),  an  American
       astronomer, engineer and architect.

       Langley worked out the aerodynamic principles for manned flight.  In
       principal, his calculations   were   correct;   but  the  structural
       material he used for wings and engines were insufficient.

       In DECEMBER of  1903,  the New York  Times  published  an  editorial
       complaining about his  foolish  dream  and the associated  waste  of
       government money.  The  editorial predicted that: "man would not fly
       for a thousand years".

       Only 9 days after the editorial was  published,  the Wright brothers
       made their first successful powered flight at Kitty  Hawk,  Dec. 17,
       1903.  But, again,   as   late  as  1905,  the  Scientific  American
       suggested the happening was a hoax - two years after the event which
       changed history.  Let's reflect for  a  moment on the fact that only
       in a single  lifetime,  man  has journeyed from Kitty  Hawk  to  the
       surface of the Moon!

       The analogy to   the  problem  of  alternative  energies  and  their
       development is, of course, obvious.  We are to educate the preaching
       orthodoxies.  But orthodox solutions  are  no  longer  enough.   Our
       system of education can only give from the past.  The  present  must
       operate on inspiration and intuition, or the future will be lost.

       The past no  longer has enough of the answers for arising crisis for
       which there are no precedents.  To  keep  pace with the requirements
       of the future, we must begin to teach not only what  to  learn,  but
       how to learn, how to analyze, how to search for the truth.  Only
       then will we   be   able  to  recognize  the  discrepancies  between
       experiment and dogma and to cope with the problems which appear to

                                      Page 1





       be just beyond  the  corner.  History has shown again and again that
       no single individual  can  rise  above  the  species  without  being
       persecuted.  The reasons for that are:

             Some of the most powerful forces in homo sapiens  have  always
             been GREED,  PRIDE,  EGO,  FEAR  and, above all, the DESIRE TO
             CONTROL OTHERS.

       A brand new  German  book titled "Energy  in  Abundance",  which  is
       evidently creating a considerable impact in the European  community,
       challenges the contemporary  high priests of science, the "Guardians
       of the Status    Quo"   and   uncovers    an    almost    incredible
       narrowmindedness and ignorance in science, politics  and  economics,
       "approaching the criminal" as the author puts it.

       The contemporary waste   of   genuine   intellectual  creativity  is
       castigated as a cultural scandal  approaching  barbarism.   The book
       stresses that a  truly  promising  approach to the so-called  energy
       crisis requires a  fundamental  and  thorough  re-evaluation  of the
       theories, dogmas and axioms which  form  the  basis  of  present day
       science and the foundation of out technology.

       As in the past, the formidable inertia of the establishment  is  not
       only based on  inaccurate,  incomplete and outdated information, but
       also requires that we first demythologize  generally accepted claims
       so-called experts of the past.

       An excellent introduction to this problem is the article "Resistance
       by Scientists to Scientific Discovery" by Bernard Barber in Science,
       Vol.  134, pp. 596-602, Sept. 1961, or the paper by Stephan C. Brush
       in Science of March, 1974, titled "Should the History  of Science be
       rated 'X'"?, culminating with a statement of Huxley:

            "Authorities", "disciples",  and  "schools"  are  the  curse of
             science and  do  more  to  interfere  with  the  work  of  the
             scientific spirit than all its enemies".

       The former astronaut, Capt. Edgar D. Mitchell, one of our famous
       contemporaries, also stressed the need for an open mind!

            "History has  shown  time  and again that important  scientific
             discoveries generally  happen  only when someone steps outside
             the limits  of  his  traditional   disciplines  and  looks  at
             something from a fresh point of view.  Then what  should  have
             been obvious all along comes into focus".

       Those of us who are familiar with the pioneering efforts of Dr. Hans
       Nieper of Hanover will Appreciate this statement by an ex-astronaut.

       One of the  most important cornerstones of today's scientific dogmas
       dates back to 1905, more than 3/4 of a century ago.  Lest we forget,
       television and radar, jet aircraft  and  cyclotrons, moonrockets and
       close-up photos of the planets of out solar system  were nothing but
       wild fantasies of science fiction then.

       The speed of  light  was  assumed  to  be  constant  and the maximum
       possible speed in the universe; vacuum  was  to be a total void.  In
       reality, the  speed  of  light  as measured in the Michaelson-Morley
       experiments was not at all the same in all directions.  The "ether

                                      Page 2





       drift" still amounted  to  the  respectable  velocity  of about five
       miles per second, and similar results  were  obtained by D.C. Miller
       in a series  of experiments extending over 25 years,  from  1902  to
       1926.

             "Even worse, the measurements showed such marked discrepancies
              with previous  results  as to occasion a distress call to the
              US Coast  &  Geodetic  Survey,   whose  surveyors  repeatedly
              remeasured the length of the tube and found  no error there,"
              reported the Popular Science Monthly March 1934 issue.

              And it continued: "More recently, speed of light observations
              only emphasized  the  apparent  erratic behavior of the light
              beam that the scientists were  attempting  to  plot.  On some
              days it seems to travel faster than others by  as  much as 12
              miles a second.

              Its speed seems to vary with the season, also in a mysterious
              shorter cycle lasting about 2 weeks.  Finally, the scientists
              ended by taking an AVERAGE of all the readings which has been
              announced as 186,271 miles per second".

       In his paper  "A Critical Look At The Theory of Relativity", Library
       of Congress Cat. No. 77-670044, F.K.  Preikschat  compiled all known
       light velocity measurements during the past 300 years  or  so,  from
       Olaf Roemer in  1676  to  the  Laser  measurements  conducted by the
       National Bureau of Standards (USA) in 1972.

       Of the 27 experiments undertaken in this field, 18 of them after the
       turn of this century, it must be  concluded  that  the  velocity  of
       light as measured  within  the  reference system of  our  Earth  has
       changed as much  as  plus/minus  50  km/sec during the past century.
       Preikschat plotted a  curve  of  these  deviations  and  suggests  a
       possible relationship between sunspot activities and  changes of the
       Earths magnetic field during the time period in question.

       The "universal constancy  of  light" appears, therefore, as somewhat
       shaky "empirical evidence"   for   our   cornerstone   in   physics,
       especially since Einstein himself has gone on record as saying:

            "If a single one of the conclusions drawn from  it (relativity)
             proves to  be wrong, it must be given up; to modify it without
             destroying the whole structure seems to be impossible".
