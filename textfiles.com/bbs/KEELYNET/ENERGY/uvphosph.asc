A Bright Idea that Works: NonToxic Phosphors

The cornfields surrounding Michigan Biotechnology Institute in Lansing are a
font of innovation.  From humble ears of corn, MBI scientists have developed
building blocks for drugs, even a salt substitute, and now a photoluminescent
material.  Research scientist Richard Turk discovered the "lumbinates" when he
was analyzing corn-derived salt substitutes under ultraviolet light: One
GLOWED IN THE DARK.

Most phosphors, used in everything from lasers to laundry-detergent
brighteners, are derived from carcinogenic benzene.  But the MBI phosphors are
biodegradable and nontoxic.  The current formulas glow MOST VISIBLY under UV
light.  That means they could safely be used in packaging and food products as
photoactivated switches in fiber optics.

Turk and his team are working on a formula that would glow well under
fluorescent light, too, for novelty candies and clothing.  So far, some 300
companies are testing the new phosphors, including major cereal and candy
companies.  Chicago-based Ajax Adhesives Industries, Inc., for instance, is
developing a glue with the phosphor.
