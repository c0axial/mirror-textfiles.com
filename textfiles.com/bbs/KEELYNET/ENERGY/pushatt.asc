                      A Pressure/Energy Density Interpretation of
                              Attractive Behavior and Forces

       Newtonian gravitation, and  the  body of theory which developed from
       it, is dominantly expressed in the  language  and concepts of action
       at-a-distance, a practice which, in some ways, is little better than
       saying that ghosts are responsible for physical phenomena.

       It may be  easily  shown,  however,  that  "attractive"  forces  are
       readily interpreted as  a consequence of local cause dynamics, field
       effects notwithstanding. Two examples will illustrate this principle
       and describe the procedure whereby attraction appears in two-body
       interactions.

       The first is drawn from quantum  mechanics  and  treats  in  brief a
       theoretical model of two-body attraction via the Casimir Effect. The
       second example derives   attractive   behavior  from   a   classical
       treatment of momentum currents and stress-tensor analysis, resulting
       in a simple  mechanical representation of gravitational action. Some
       theorists believe that both effects  are  a  reflection  of the same
       process, albeit with some modification in the case  of  gravity,  to
       account for its vastly weaker amplitude.

       The Casimir Effect treats the problem of two conductive (dielectric)
       plates brought into   close   proximity.   In   this  case,  quantum
       fluctuations (zero-point energy)   provide   the  actual  motivating
       source responsible for   the  observed  "attraction",   though   the
       specific mechanisms of this source will not be addressed here.

       The model of  this  action  is  both  simple and straightforward. It
       begins with a  consideration  of   vacuum   fluctuations  and  their
       distribution, which takes  the  form  of  an  isotropic   "sea"   of
       electromagnetic waves filling space.

       Any two bodies  imposed on this isotropic flux immediately alter its
       distribution, creating a form of energy "shadow" between the plates.
       More precisely, the presence of the  plates  alters the distribution
       of modes in  the  vacuum, with fewer modes being maintained  between
       the plates than on their exterior surfaces.

       The ensuing imbalance,  with a greater amount of energy impinging on
       the plates from outside than is contained between them, produces a

                                      Page 1





       "push" on the  plates, which in older terminology would be construed
       as an attraction. The strength of the Casimir Effect is proportional
       to (hc/r^4), where "h" is Planck's  constant,  "c"  is  the speed of
       light in vacuum, and "r" is a unit distance.

       Thus, the interaction  is  proportional  to  the energy  density  or
       pressure created by  the difference in flux on opposite sides of the
       plates. The "attraction" is perfectly  analogous  to what happens if
       two discs, or balls, are placed in the two ends of an empty pipe.

       Were the pipe  to  filled with fluid or high-pressure  gas  at  both
       ends, the discs  or  balls would be pushed together in proportion to
       the pressure of fluid flow. At no  time  does a true attraction take
       place.

       A more explicitly   dynamic   model   of   both  gravitational   and
       electromagnetic "attraction" is  presented by Hermann and Schmid (1-
       4), who treat  field effects as a  function  of  momentum  currents,
       where force results from a flow of (negative) momentum  between  two
       or more bodies,  and  mechanical  stress is a function of (negative)
       momentum current density.

       A useful result of this representation  is  the ability to visualize
       streamlines of momentum flow in such a way as to make tensor effects
       immediately intuitive, thereby  adding greatly to  understanding  of
       the principles involved.

       The starting point  for  study  of  this process is a stress tensor,
       written in Cartesian form,

                   Ó=(1/8„G)( 3(dP/dj)^2*Î-2(dP/di)(dP/dk) )

       where "G" is Newton's constant, "P" is the gravitational potential,
       (i,j,k) are the Cartesian coordinates, or indices, and "Î" is the
       Kronecker symbol. The "d" refers to partial differentiation, and
       the three expresses a sum over the principal axes. This expression
       is essentially the same as the negative of Maxwell's stress tensor
       for electrostatic fields, with the electric potential replacing the
       gravitational potential. The momentum current interpretation treats
       a negative stress tensor as a momentum current density tensor.

       When couched in Cartesian matrix  form,  the  rows or columns of the
       matrix, (i, j,  k)  or  (x,  y,  z),  represent the  vector  current
       densities of the  respective  coordinates.  These  are the functions
       which may be graphed to produce streamlines of the relevant currents
       and forces responsible for gravitational dynamics. (Not shown.)

       Two different flows are produced  and  revealed  by  the  streamline
       pictures. The first is a flow which returns to its  body  of origin.
       This creates a  static pressure on the body which is responsible for
       gravitational collapse.

       The second flow  circulates between  two  bodies  and  relates  more
       dynamical information. In  the x-momentum plane, one  finds  that  a
       body will lose momentum as the currents from a second body flow away
       from it and back to the second body.

       The currents originating  from  the  second body return to it with a
       surplus momentum taken from the first body, and actually increase

                                      Page 2





       its momentum. These  currents  do not take the shortest path between
       the bodies, but instead take wide  loops  around  them. Little or no
       momentum is exchanged in the other two planes between the bodies.

       When this picture  is evaluated in terms of mechanical  stress,  one
       finds that the   bodies   are  not  being  pulled  together  by  the
       gravitational field, but are instead pushed together by the pressure
       of their common field.

       A curious conclusion of this analysis  is  that gravity is shown not
       to act along  the  center line of the bodies; there  is  in  fact  a
       region along the center line where the current density vanishes.

       In the figure  below,  a  yoke  and  spring assembly illustrates the
       basic process of momentum flow and  gravitational  action. Springs 1
       and 2 are  under  pressure,  with x-momentum flowing  from  left  to
       right. Springs 3  and 4, with x-momentum flowing from right to left,
       are under tension. Gravity acts similarly.  Positive  x-momentum  in
       the field translates to local pressure, whereas negative x-momentum
       translates to local tension.

       Both the models discussed here, the Casimir Effect, and the momentum
       current analysis, present a dynamics of attraction which derive from
       a local cause "push" mechanism, contrary to common  terminology  and
       belief.

       This "push" is  a  function of energy density or pressure, described
       by Hermann and Schmid in terms of  momentum density currents, and by
       Casimir in terms of radiation pressure.  Gravitation  is still a bit
       mysterious, as it  lacks  a  clear  source  of energy and medium for
       momentum exchange, in contrast to  the Casimir Effect and well known
       electromagnetic interactions.

       Some theorists, notably   Puthoff,   suggest   that    the   quantum
       fluctuations responsible for  the Casimir Effect are responsible for
       gravity as well. (5) Close approximations  of Newton's constant have
       been derived, based   on   two  forms  of  Casimir  potentials   and
       fluctuation phenomena. (6) If, in fact, quantum fluctuations are the
       energy source of  gravity, Hermann and Schmid's representation would
       not be negated, nor would Einstein's theory of spatial curvature.

       Both employ the language and concepts of tensor dynamics to reveal a
       deeper structure in nature, one that is largely independent of the

                                      Page 3





       detailed qualities of  a  source  or  system. Einstein's theory, for
       example, recreates the dynamics of  a  ball  on  a rubber sheet. The
       method is no  less  accurate for being applied to  gravity,  as  the
       dynamics involved are perfectly analogous to one another.

       Similarly, Hermann and  Schmid's  representation  is  just  as valid
       within its domain of applicability. It has practical usefulness, for
       it explicitly reveals the vanishing  point  of  momentum  flow where
       another body (satellite)  could  be  stably inserted.  By  contrast,
       those models of  gravity  which address its source contain dynamical
       information in more implicit form, removed from easy access.

       The momentum current dynamics of Hermann  and Schmid largely succeed
       because of their  simplification  of  source  details,   which   are
       submerged in the mathematical device of the potential. A hybrid form
       of gravitational theory  would,  ideally,  apply  the information of
       source details to the construction  of more accurate potentials, and
       thereby achieve more exacting control over those processes  effected
       by gravity.

       A potential created   by   Casimir-type  sources  would  necessarily
       involve short-range corrections similar to those suggested by recent
       reexamination of Eotvos' experiments.   Such  corrections  might  be
       negligible at long  range (i.e., for geostationary satellites),  but
       could have observable  effects in low-altitude ballistics (i.e., the
       classified "shortfall" distance of ICBM's).

       Measurements of Newton's constant, in turn, evaluate the total force
       on two bodies at close range, and  usually  fail  to distinguish the
       contribution from Casimir effects, which are far  more  powerful  at
       short distances.  As Hermann and Schmid illustrate, the details of a
       process one observes  are  often  dependent  on  the  technique  and
       qualitative construction one employs.  The  choice  of technique and
       interpretation applied to a given problem depend on  the information
       one requires, and  that  is  always subjective in nature. One choice
       need not negate the other, so long  as one is aware of the strengths
       and weaknesses of the method chosen.
