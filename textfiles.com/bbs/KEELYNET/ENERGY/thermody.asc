NEW BEGINNING FOR THERMODYNAMICS

The reactions and questions received on my articles "Vortex - The natural
movement" and "Understanding Water Power" (both bundled on KeelyNet as
H2OVORTX.ZIP) show that there is much interest in the subject of
thermodynamics.

In fact, the "laws of thermodynamics" have long been the subject of heated
debate, especially between the promoters and the detractors of another field -
that of "perpetual motion".

Joachim Kirchhoff, who has done a thorough research on the development and the
history of thermodynamics (1) has shown that these laws, and especially the
basic assumption of conservation of energy, can be traced back to an
authoritative pronunciation of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris, made in
the year 1775, saying that henceforth, the Academy "will no longer accept or
deal with proposals concerning perpetual motion". Their reasoning was, that
perpetual motion is impossible to achieve and that the search for it is time
consuming and very expensive. According to the members of the academy, those
bright minds dedicating their time and resources to this search, could be
utilized much better in other, more reasonable endeavors.

So the fact that until that time, no one had succeeded in constructing a
workable device of "perpetual motion", was used as the reason to forbid, de
facto, any further research in that direction. The "laws" thus established and
enshrined as the laws of thermodynamics, have entered the official screening
process of all new inventions. Patent offices all over the world have more or
less consistently refused since then to grant recognition to anything that
was, in their opinion, infringing upon these laws.

Herbrand writes (2) that prof. Pollermann of the JÅlich Atomic Research
Institute in Germany, who is an "expert" pre-examiner of patents in the energy
sector, has given a negative opinion on 43 % of the patent applications
referred to him! He reasons that "the natural laws accepted by science must be
followed" and says that many people (in his view irrationally) "wish to make
use of the eternal forces of gravitation and magnetism".

We can see from this how efficient our current patent system is in suppressing
any real renewal in the field of physics. I have written about the subject of
patents in an earlier article (3).

Conservation of energy

There is such a thing as conservation of energy. However our understanding of
the concept is largely incomplete. By negating the idea of an ether, which I
called "space background" (4), we have limited our conception of energy to
that which is observable on the purely physical plane. All electric and
magnetic as well as gravitational phenomena however, are not purely physical.
They require for their understanding a conception of a higher-dimensional
space background, which is, to use the term of Moray, a "sea of energy".

Conservation of energy in the current form of understanding is a useless
concept, as it negates the existence of this giant reservoir of energy, and
does not take into account the constant interchange (through the phenomena of
electricity, magnetism and gravitation), of our world of physical existence
with that reservoir.  Generation of electrical energy through magnetism for
example, is not limited to the mechanical motive power applied to a generator
and the movement of electrons through a wire, but involves a complex exchange
between space background and physical machinery.

In this context, it may be profitable to remember a statement that Robert
Mayer (5) made in connection with the concept of conservation of energy. He
said: "Seeing gravity as the cause of the falling of things, we talk about
gravitation and thereby overlook, that an essential characteristic of any
'force' (energy) is to unify within itself the attributes of indestructibility
and mutability."

This statement should set us thinking. Mayer in fact asserts that energy, in
addition to being indestructible, is also able to change form. This implies
that we can not necessarily think in terms of unidirectional mutability, a
concept which thermodynamics has however maintained since the inception of its
famous "laws".

Now the specific form of energy which is the subject of thermodynamics is
heat.

What is heat?

As a first step in our approach to the understanding of thermodynamics, we
must try to understand what is this substance that forms the basis of the
theory. Heat has at first been imagined to be a fluid and has been given the
name "caloric". Soon caloric theory, which was at the basis of our famous
"laws", gave way to the contemporary understanding, that heat is an excited
state of matter, transferred through direct contact or through the mediation
of electromagnetic waves of the infrared band.

Absence of heat, or the temperature of absolute zero, is defined as a complete
absence of molecular motion.

We shall, for the time being, accept this concept and add some other thoughts:

- Heat is a property of matter. Without matter, no heat.

- The molecular motion that we call heat is a chaotic, a random motion.

- An increase of heat is an increase of randomity in matter. A decrease of
  heat denotes progressively greater order of molecular alignment.

Two kinds of motion

In this universe, we have two basic kinds of motion: centrifugal and
centripetal.

Centrifugal motion is outward directed. It is an expanding, a radiating,
explosive motion. It has a tendency to increase the randomity in matter and
thereby cause heat.

This is the kind of motion we are accustomed to. It has been used in our
technology since the discovery of the fire, and especially since the invention
of the steam engine and the consequent industrial revolution. Our continued
and exclusive use of this motion has given us useful but dangerous machinery,
polluting internal combustion engines, radio and microwave technology that has
definite negative effects on human, animal and plant life and last but not
least the daughter of the atomic bomb, our atomic power plant, which is little
more than a steam turbine using a very dangerous source of heat, radioactive
uranium.

We do not have to look far to see the results of this technology: A rapid and
extensive increase in atmospheric CO2 since the start of the industrial
revolution, a crisis of raw materials and energy of gigantic proportions just
around the corner, and a situation where it is almost impossible today to find
some clean air to breathe or some real fresh, healthy spring water to drink.

Centripetal motion on the other hand is inward directed. It is a contracting,
a gravitative, an implosive kind of motion. It has a tendency to align and de-
randomize the particles of matter and causes a decrease in temperature.

Centripetal motion is associated with the animating force we call life, which
physics in its desire to be "objective" or "scientific" has steadfastly
refused to look at.

Here we have the key to resolving the riddle of thermodynamics. We can see how
nature, using both these types of motion in a balanced way, can ever
regenerate itself. It simply goes, over and over again, through a whole cycle
of
                    chaos  -  build-up  -  decay  -  chaos,

using the centripetal or vortex motion in the build-up part of the cycle and
the radiative, heat generating motion in the decay part.

Entropy

The idea of entropy, of the constant and irreversible winding down of the
universe, was introduced with the second law of thermodynamics. This law is
based on an observation of James Watt's steam machine, which was the only
technological utilization of thermal energy available at the time.

Entropy is associated with radiation. It signifies an ever increasing
randomity of motion, an expenditure of the "innate energy of a system".
According to the current views of thermodynamics, there is no antidote to
entropy. Once expended, energy is said to be lost forever in that giant heat
sink, which we imagine the vast reaches of the universe to be.

One of the great minds of this century, an outsider to established science,
has recognized the folly of this view and coined a term for the antidote. He
calls it syntropy. In his book "Cosmography", R. Buckminster Fuller writes
(6): "The reader will discover that the inexorable course of the gradual
running down of the energy of the universe - that is, entropy - is only part
of the picture. Entropy has a complementary phase, which we designated
syntropy".

We can now assert that syntropy is real, and that it is closely associated
with the second kind of motion discussed above, with the centripetal, the
vortex motion.

While radiation is an entropic phenomenon, gravitation is an expression of
syntropy.

Gravitation

We know much about radiation, but comparatively little is known about its
"negative" twin, gravitation. I am using the term gravitation here in a much
wider sense than is generally done in physics. Gravitation in this context
means an electromagnetic phenomenon associated with a vortex in space
background. It is a twin of radiation, only with the vector inversed.

Gravitation is a pulling phenomenon, and the effect we are most familiar with
is that gravitation keeps us firmly glued to this planet . But gravitation is
more than that. It can manifest itself in just as wide a range of wavelengths
as does radiation.

Gravitation in this extended sense explains for instance the phenomenon found
in most "free energy" devices, which often show a marked cooling effect on
their immediate environment. This is simply radiation in reverse, caused by an
independent source of gravitation, a point of attraction, which causes energy
to "inflow" towards that point, rather than expanding outwards from it, as we
usually observe.

Anti-gravity thereby becomes accessible to engineering. If gravitation is
nothing but an inverse radiation, a pulling phenomenon associated with a
vortex, all we need to do in order to obtain levitation or anti-gravity is to
establish an independent source of gravitation and orient it in opposition to
the gravitation of this planet. Applications in space propulsion would be
comparatively easy to engineer.

How do we establish an independent source of gravitation? We establish, by
whatever means available, magnetic, mechanic or otherwise, a strong vortex in
the background field of space. There are numerous examples of such occurrences
in the tales that surround the field of "free energy", that have not been
understood so far and therefore were incredulously dismissed as the fantasies
of a bunch of loonies.

Maybe we should look at these phenomena again and try to understand them with
the new conception we now have of gravity?

The thermodynamic cycle

The thermodynamic cycle as currently understood is a one-way street. It leads
from a source of heat (fuel) via combustion to motion, but the heat must be
constantly renewed through more fuel, as it is "lost" to the environment in
the process.

In an article based on the research of Viktor Schauberger, regarding the
functions of vortex motion, SchÑffer (7) writes in 1972:

"If the second law (of thermodynamics) does not hold true in the case of
vortex motion, one could postulate the following cycle:

Heat            Vortex            Motion            Friction            Heat

Vortices therefore should be able to change heat energy into motive energy.
This would necessitate an acceleration of flow and a cooling effect. Both of
these can be observed in the case of vortices".

I will not attempt to provide a mathematical description for this circular
process, but in the terms used in this article, I want to restate what has
been proposed by SchÑffer, to put forth a new and radically different
thermodynamic circular process :

 Centrifugal motion
 (expansive, explosive)

 Radiation

 Heat increase

 Centripetal motion
 (contractive, implosive)

 Gravitation

 Heat decrease

This is the natural thermodynamic cycle of this universe.  Using this cycle,
that is, using both the centrifugal and the centripetal part and thus
establishing a stable pulsation, it will be possible to engineer new clean
forms of motion-producing and energy-producing machinery, that do not depend
on fuel such as petrol, coal or gas for their motion. Does that sound like a
perpetuum mobile?

What is a perpetuum mobile?

I think we have to reconsider our strict negation of the possibility of any
perpetuum mobile, which ultimately is based on nothing other than the ideas of
the honorable members of the French Academy of Sciences of 1775. In fact, any
machine which is constructed according to the principles of nature, using the
cycle as described here, will have the characteristics of what used to be
called a perpetuum mobile.

This does not mean, that the law of conservation of energy is violated.

We have simply extended our conception of this law, to include, besides the
immediately visible physical universe, also the "sea of energy" which is the
higher-dimensional space background.

We have found a way, in other words, to tap into the very wheelwork of nature
and utilize its energies more efficiently.

At this point, I would like to thank all those inventors who have encountered
these phenomena in their research and who, despite a completely inadequate
scientific basis, have persisted to make their inventions reality. I would
like to acknowledge that their inventions are real. Despite any refusal of
patent examiners and despite the usual incredulity they have encountered
everywhere.

It should also be said that this article would not have been possible without
the immense work Viktor Schauberger has done in observing and describing the
mechanics inherent in the vortex motion of water, and without those that have
collected and published what was left of Schauberger's writings to keep the
flame of this knowledge alive for future generations.

One last word about thermodynamics: It seems that things went wrong when we
were trying to imagine a closed system. That is something achievable only in
theory. Because every system existing within this universe is in constant and
continuous exchange with the rest of the universe. And how this universe is
made, what it consists of and how it functions, we have not even remotely
begun to understand.
