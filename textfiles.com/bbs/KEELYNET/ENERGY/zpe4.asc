                              Everything for Nothing

                                 by Harold Puthoff

       Classical physics tells  us  that  if  we  think  of  an  atom  as a
       miniature solar system with electronic  planets  orbiting  a nuclear
       sun, then it  should  not  exist.   The  circling  electrons  SHOULD
       RADIATE AWAY their energy like microscopic radio antennas and spiral
       into the nucleus.   To  resolve  this  problem,  physicists  had  to
       introduce a set of mathematical rules,  called quantum mechanics, to
       describe what happens.  Quantum theory endows matter and energy
       with both wave and particle-like characteristics.  It also restrains
       electrons to particular  orbits, or energy levels,  so  they  cannot
       radiate energy unless they jump from one orbit to another.

       Measuring the spectral  lines  of atoms verifies that quantum theory
       is correct.  Atoms appear to emit  or  absorb  packets  of light, or
       photons, with a   wavelength   that  exactly  coincides   with   the
       difference between its energy levels as predicted by quantum theory.
       As a result,  the  majority  of physicists are content simply to use
       quantum rules that  describe so accurately  what  happens  in  their
       experiments.

       Nevertheless, when we  repeat  the question: "But  why  doesn't  the
       electron radiate away its energy?", the answer is: "Well, in quantum
       theory it JUST  DOESN'T".   It  is  at  this point that not only the
       layman but also some physicists begin  to  feel  that someone is not
       playing fair.  Indeed, much of modern physics is based  on  theories
       couched in a  form that works but they do not answer the fundamental
       questions of what gravity is, why  the Universe is the way it is, or
       how it got started anyway.  Surprisingly, there may  be  answers  to
       these seemingly unanswerable    questions.     Perhaps   even   more
       surprising, the answers seem to be  emerging  from  empty space, the
       vacuum, the void.

       In fact, according to quantum theory, the vacuum, the  space between
       particles of matter  as  well as between the stars, is not empty, it
       is filled with vast amounts of fluctuating energy.

       To understand this extraordinary idea, we will have to take a detour
       into the phenomenon  of  "fluctuations"  with  which  quantum theory
       abounds.  Fluctuations arise as one of the most fundamental concepts
       to come out  of the mathematics of  quantum  theory.   This  is  the
       uncertainty principle enunciated by Werner Heisenberg in 1927, which
       says that it is impossible to know everything about a system because
       of what would seem to be inherent fluctuations in the very fabric of
       nature itself.  Indeed,  quantum  mechanics is a statistical  theory
       that deals with  probabilities and it has some profound consequences
       for our understanding of reality.   For instance, we cannot know the
       position and the momentum of an electron at the same  time.   If  we
       know its momentum,  or energy, accurately, then we can determine its
       position only probabilistically.

       This "fuzziness" of  positions described  in  terms  of  probability
       waves gives a measure of the size and shape over which an electronic
       orbit fluctuates in an atom.  It also means that  the  energy  of  a
       particle or system is "fuzzy" and thus there is a slight probability
       of it changing, or fluctuating, to another value.  In fact, a system
       can actually, by  fluctuation,  "tunnel"  through  an energy barrier
       because there is  a  small  but finite  probability  of  the  system
       existing on the other side of the barrier.  I shall  discuss later a
       possible cause for such fluctuation phenomena.

       The adjective zero-point  denotes  that such motion exists even at a
       temperature of absolute  zero where  no  thermal  agitation  effects
       remain.  Although we cannot observe the zero-point  energy  on, say,
       the pendulum of  a  grandfather clock because it is so minute, it is
       nonetheless real.  In  many  physical  systems  this  has  important
       consequences.  One example  is the presence of a certain  amount  of
       "noise" in a microwave receiver that can NEVER be removed, no matter
       how perfect the technology.

       This zero-point energy  is  the  result of the unpredicatable random
       fluctuations of the vacuum energy,  as  predicted by the uncertainty
       principle, which is  zero  in  classical  theory.   In  fact,  these
       fluctuations can be  intense  enough TO CAUSE PARTICLES TO FORM from
       the vacuum SPONTANEOUSLY,  provided   they  disappear  again  before
       violating the uncertainty  principle.  This temporary  formation  of
       "virtual" particles is  somewhat akin to the spray that forms near a
       turbulent waterfall.  (also termed "quantum foam"....Vangard)

       Of all the   zero-point  fluctuation   phenomena,   the   zero-point
       fluctuations of electromagnetic energy are the most  easy to detect.
       Electromagnetic waves have standing, or travelling modes, that are a
       bit like the  various  modes  of  waves  going  along a rope that is
       shaken.  Each set of waves has its  own  characteristic set of nodes
       and crests.  It turns out that even though the zero-point  energy in
       any particular mode   of   an   electromagnetic   field   is  minute
       (equivalent to half a photon's worth),  there are nearly an infinite
       number of possible  modes  of propagation, that is  frequencies  and
       directions.  The zero-point energy ADDED UP OVER ALL POSSIBLE MODES,
       therefore, is QUITE  ENORMOUS.   As  hard as it is to believe, it is
       greater than the energy density in  the atomic nucleus.  And this in
       all of the so-called "empty" space around us.

       Because the zero-point energy of the electromagnetic  fields  is  so
       large, you might  expect  to see its effects easily, but this is not
       the case because its density is very uniform.  Just as a vase

                                      Page 2





       standing in a true void is not likely to fall over spontaneously,
       so a vase  bombarded UNIFORMLY on all sides by packets of zero-point
       energy would not do likewise because  of  the BALANCED CONDITIONS of
       the uniform bombardment.   The only evidence of such  a  barrage  of
       energy might be  minute  jiggling  of the vase.  Such a mechanism is
       thought to be involved in the quantum JIGGLE of zero-point motions.

       There are situations,  however,   where   the   uniformity   of  the
       electromagnetic zero-point energy  is  slightly disturbed  and  this
       leads to effects  you  can  ACTUALLY MEASURE.  One situation is when
       the zero-point energy perturbs slightly  the  spectra  of lines from
       transitions between quantum levels in atoms.  This  perturbation  is
       known as the  LAMB SHIFT, named after the American physicist, Willis
       Lamb.  This work carried out in the  late  1940's,  using techniques
       developed for wartime  radar, showed that the effect  of  zero-point
       fluctuations of the   electromagnetic   field   was  to  jiggle  the
       electrons slightly in their atomic  orbits,  leading  to  a shift in
       frequency of transitions of about 1000 MEGAHERTZ.

       Another, also named after its discoverer, is the  CASIMIR  EFFECT  -
       which predicts that  two  metal  plates  close together ATTRACT EACH
       OTHER.  Consider plates set at a  certain  distance  apart.   In the
       space between the plates, only those vacuum fluctuations for which a
       whole number of half-waves just spans the distance  can  exist, just
       like waves formed  by shaking a rope tied at both ends.  Outside the
       plates, the fluctuations can have  many more values because there is
       more space.  The number of modes outside the plates,  all  of  which
       carry energy and  momentum,  is  greater  than  those  inside.  This
       imbalance PUSHES THE PLATES TOGETHER.   (the metal plates would thus
       serve as a ZPE refractor, see NEUTRAL1 on KeelyNet....Vangard)

       What does this  have  to do with  our  basic  question  of  why  the
       electron in a simple hydrogen atom does not radiate  as  it  circles
       the protons in  its  lowest-energy  orbit?   I  have considered this
       point by taking into account what other physicists have learned over
       the years about the effects of zero-point energy.  I discovered that
       you can consider  the electron as  continually  radiating  away  its
       energy as predicted   by   classical   theory,  but   SIMULTANEOUSLY
       ABSORBING a COMPENSATING  AMOUNT of energy from the ever-present sea
       of zero-point energy in which the  atom is immersed.  An equilibrium
       between these two processes leads to the correct values for the

                                      Page 3





       parameters that define the lowest energy, or ground-state orbit (see
       "Why atoms don't  collapse,"  NEW SCIENTIST, July 1987).  Thus there
       is a DYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM in which  the  zero-point energy stabilises
       the electron in a set ground-state orbit.  It seems  that  the  very
       stability of matter itself appears to depend on an underlying sea of
       electromagnetic zero-point energy.

                       Gravity as a Long-Range Casimir Force

       As well as  providing  new  insights into quantum theory, zero-point
       fluctuations also give  us some insight  into  gravity.   Einstein's
       general theory of relativity describes gravity well  but we still do
       not know its  fundamental nature very well.  The theory is basically
       descriptive without revealing  the   underlying  dynamics  for  that
       description.  As a result, attempts to unify gravity  with the other
       forces (electromagnetic, strong  and  weak  nuclear  forces)  or  to
       develop a quantum theory of gravity  have  foundered again and again
       on difficulties that  can be traced back to a lack of  understanding
       at a fundamental  level.   To  rectify these difficulties, theorists
       have resorted to    ever-increasing     levels    of    mathematical
       sophistication and abstraction,  as  in  the recent  development  of
       supergravity and superstring theories.

       The well-known Soviet  physicist  Andrei  Sakharov took a completely
       different tack to  explain  such difficulties.   He  suggested  that
       gravity might not be a fundamental interaction at all,  but rather a
       secondary or RESIDUAL    effect    associated   with   other,   non-
       gravitational fields.  Gravity might  be  an effect brought about by
       changes in the zero-point energy of the vacuum, due  to the presence
       of matter ("A  key  to  understanding gravity", NEW SCIENTIST, April
       1981).  If correct, you could then  consider  gravity as a variation
       on the Casimir  theme,  in  which the pressures of background  zero-
       point energy were  again  responsible.   Although  Sakharov  did not
       develop the concept much further,  he  did  outline certain criteria
       such a theory would have to meet - for example, predicting the value
       of the gravitational constant G in terms of the parameters  given by
       zero-point energy theory.

       I have studied  Sakharov's  approach  to gravity in detail with some
       positive results.  A particle sitting  in the sea of electromagnetic
       zero-point fluctuations develops    a    "jitter"     motion,     or
       ZITTERBEWEGUNG as German  physicists  have named it.  When there are
       two or more particles, they are  each  influenced  not  only  by the
       fluctuating background field,  but also by the fields  generated  by
       the other particles, all similarly undergoing Zitterbewegung motion.
       The coupling between  particles  due  to  these  fields produces the
       attractive gravitational force.     Gravity   can,   therefore,   be
       understood as a sort of LONG-RANGE Casimir force.

       Because of its electromagnetic underpinning, gravitational theory in
       this form constitutes what is known as an "already-unified"  theory.
       The main benefit  of  the  new  approach  is  that  it  helps  us to
       understand characteristics of  the   way  gravity  works  that  were
       previously unexplained.  These include why gravity  is  so weak; why
       positive but not  negative  mass  exists;  and the fact that gravity
       cannot be shielded because zero-point fluctuations pervade space and
       so cannot be shielded.

                                      Page 4





       So, if we have an explanation for non-radiating atomic ground states
       and for gravity,  do  we  know  where the electromagnetic zero-point
       energy comes from in the first place?   There  are  two  schools  of
       thought.  One is  that  it  is  just simply a part of  the  boundary
       conditions of our   Universe   like,  for  example,  the  background
       radiation left over from the big bang.   The other is that the zero-
       point energy is  generated  by  quantum-fluctuation  motion  of  the
       charged particles of  the  latter.  I assumed that zero-point fields
       drive the motion throughout the  Universe,  in  turn,  generate  the
       zero-point fields in the form of a self-regenerating feedback cycle,
       not unlike a cat chasing its own tail.

       This self-consistent approach  yielded the correct  values  for  the
       zero-point field.  Thus, the zero-point fields observed at any given
       point are due to random radiation arriving from particles throughout
       the Unverse that are themselves undergoing zero-point motion ("Where
       does the zero-point  energy  come from?", NEW SCIENTIST, December 2,
       1989).

       These self-regenerating zero-point  fields also produce the familiar
       properties of quantum theory, such as fluctuation phenomena  and the
       uncertainty principle, for  example.    This  means that it might be
       possible to model many aspects of  quantum  theory  on  the basis of
       self-consistent, random interactions between particles and the zero-
       point fluctuation fields they generate.

       Although a knowledge  of  zero-point  fields  emerged  from  quantum
       physics as that  subject  matured,  Timothy Boyer at City College in
       New York took a contrary view.  In  the late 1960's, he began asking
       what would happen  if  we  took  classical physics  as  it  was  and
       introduced a background  of random, classical fluctuating zero-point
       fields.  Such fields would presumably have originated in the initial
       random processes of the big bang and  then by regeneration as I have
       just described.  Could such an all-classical model reproduce quantum
       theory in its  entirety,  and  might  this  possibility   have  been
       overlooked by the  founders  of quantum theory who were not aware of
       the existence of such a fluctuating background field?

       Boyer began by tackling the problems  that  led  to  quantum  theory
       being introduced in the first place, such as the blackbody radiation
       curve and the  photoelectric  effect.   His  upstart,   neoclassical
       approach reproduced the  known  quantum  results  one  by one.  This
       approach is called STOCHASTIC ELECTRODYNMAICS  (SED), in contrast to
       QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS (QED).   Indeed, Peter Milonni  at  the  Los
       Alamos National Labroratory in the US noted in a review of the Boyer
       work that if  physicists  in  1900 had thought of taking this route,
       they would probably have been more  comfortable  with this classical
       approach than with Max Planck's hypothesis of the quantum.   One can
       only speculate as  to  the  direction  that physics would have taken
       them.

       The list of topics successfully analysed  using  the  SED  approach,
       which produce THE SAME RESULTS as when the QED approach is used, has
       now been extended  to include the harmonic oscillator,  Casimir  and
       van der Waals forces and the thermal effects of acceleration through
       the vacuum.

       Out of this  work  emerged  the  reasons  for  such phenomena as the
       uncertainty principle, the fluctuating motion of particles, the

                                      Page 5





       existence of van  der  Waals forces even at zero temperature, and so
       forth, all show to be due to the influence of the unceasing activity
       of the random background fields.

       There are also some notable gaps  in  the  development  of  SED; for
       example, deriving Schrodinger's equation, as yet turns  out to be an
       intractable problem.  Several  researchers  are  confident, however,
       that this obstacle can be overcome.  Until theory as we have come to
       know it will be entirely replaced  by a refurbished classical theory
       in the near future.

       But regardless of the final outcome, the successes  to  date  of the
       SED approach, by  its  highlighting  of the role of background zero-
       point fluctuations, means that when  the final chapter is written on
       quantum theory, field fluctuations in empty space will  be  accorded
       an honoured position.

       And now to  the biggest question of all, where did the Universe come
       from?  Or, in modern terminology,  what started the big bang?  Could
       quantum fluctuations of empty space have something  to  do with this
       as well?

       Edward Tyron of  the  City University of New York thought so in 1973
       when he proposed  that  our  Universe   may  have  originated  as  a
       fluctuation of the vacuum on a large scale, as "simply  one of those
       things which happen from time to time".

       This idea was  later  refined  and  updated  within  the  context of
       inflationary cosmology by Alexander  Vilenkin  of  Tufts University,
       who proposed that the universe is created by quantum tunnelling from
       literally nothing into the something we call the Universe.  Although
       highly speculative, these  models  indicate  that  physicists   find
       themselves turning again  and  again  to  the  void and fluctuations
       therein for their answers.

       Those with a practical bent of mind  may  be  left with yet one more
       unanswered question.  Can  you  find mundane applications  for  this
       emerging Rosetta Stone  of  physics?  Will it be possible to extract
       electrical energy from  the  vacuum?    Robert   Forward  at  Hughes
       Research Laboratories in  Malibu,  California  has  considered  this
       possibility.  Could the engineer of the future specialise in "vacuum
       engineering" as the  Nobel  laureate Tsun-Dao Lee has put it?  Could
       the energy crises be solved by harnessing  the energies of the zero-
       point "sea"?  After  all,  the  basic form of zero-point  energy  is
       highly random and  tends  to cancel itself out, so if a way could be
       found to bring  order out of chaos,  then,  because  of  the  highly
       energetic nature of   the  vacuum  fluctuations,  relatively   large
       effects could be produced.

       Given our relative  ignorance  at this point, we must fall back on a
       quote given by  the Soviet science  historian  Roman  Poldolny  when
       contemplating this issue.  "It would be just as presumptuous to deny
       the feasibility of  useful application as it would be  irresponsible

       gods, the quantum fluctuations of empty space.
