                                 ALUMALOID SOLAR FILM

       At last! A new development in solar cell technology! A 72% efficient
       film you can  stick  on your window and have solar electricity.  Or,
       buy window panes with the material etched on! For Cheap! It will
       cost pennies per watt.  resent solar technology will produce no more
       than 15% efficiency.

       Dr. Alvin Marks, who used to work  for  Polaroid  Land, who holds at
       least 117 patents, has some experience with photons. His background
       knowledge is in polarizing films. He has created a  solar cell using
       quantum mechanics to  collect  the  energy of a photon at a specific
       frequency.  It is  patterned after  the  photosynthesis  process  of
       plants.

       He uses a  three  dimensional  thin-film array by which  the  photon
       gives up it's energy as it passes a sort of micro-rectifier-antenna,
       called a Rectenna.

       Two layers of  these  antennas  are etched onto a thin approximately
       one micron-thick conductive polymer film. As the light photon passes
       the first layer, it gives up 40% of  it's energy as electricity, and
       at the second layer gives 32% more, totalling 72%!  These principles
       have been well known for some time but haven't to date been used for
       converting light to electric power.

       This technology has  been  patterned  after  the photosynthetic cell
       that has been developed by the French.  It  is tuned to the angstrom
       length of light that contains the most recoverable energy.

       He first developed  the technology in the form of  a  thin  film  of
       plastic, but now  has  also  developed  an electron beam-writer that
       will etch the circuits on glass.  These  are  actually circuits that
       tune into the frequency of the light, and convert it to electricity.

       One hundred square  miles  of  this  glass  would   produce   enough
       electricity to power the entire country!

       His company is called Photo-Therm, reportedly he is selling stock.

            He can be reached at:

            Dr. Alvin Marks
            Photo-Therm
            359 Main st.
            Athol, Massachusetts, 01331.

            They/he are in the phone book also.

            Write there for more information and an informative tape.

       He got his  first  $300,000 funding from private colleges back east,
       but he left it open, (hasn't sold out) because he doesn't want it to
       be bought up by big industry. He is looking for more money. He needs
       $875,000 to do his basic research.

       Patent # is 4,445,050. April 24,  1984.  Device  for  conversion  of
       light power to electrical power.

       PhotoTherm has signed  accords  with  China, to make  Solar  Cooking
       Devices.

       At date of  this  file,  he  has  projected  about 7 months till the
       poduction prototype is set up, and  then  another  8  months  to  do
       production. He is  a  production expert, this is what  he  did  with
       Polaroid. Barring obstruction,  we  are  probably  about a year away
       from pennies-per-watt Rectenna solar film or panes.
