                       Global NRG (Relativity) Challenge
                       ---------------------------------

    Internet (et. al.) used as it should be - a world wide facility to resolve
the problems of the world - a manifestation of the Universal Mind. I have seen
the network's potential to debate and resolve difficult issues by utilizing
global knowledge and skill, and respectfully request the help of each and all
to test a hypothesis.

     I believe that I have found a simple, practical answer to the most sought
after science issue ever - relativity. If my solution is  not correct, it can
go away. If it is true, we can all share in the benefits derived from it's
eventual confirmation.

     The discovery is conceptually obtained by merely multiplying Albert
Einstein's formula for energy  E = M C ^ 2 by " C "  yet one more time to
"cube the speed of light" while dividing by 3 to adjust for the curvature of
space and the effects of relativity.  The resultant unites the gravitation and
electromagnetic phenomena.

     Virtually thousands of problems can be resolved from one physics
statement:

                  Gravity  =  M  C ^ 3 / 3

(which is, of course, also 3 G = M C C C  and  G = E * C / 3).

     This discovery has resulted in a cascade of new knowledge and a vision of
an exponential leap forward in all fields of science.  It appears to set a new
direction for research, promises "clean", "green" energy, and is emotionally
satisfying in that -one- model of cosmology fits all. This solution produces
the "Sacred Geometry" of Nature observable in geology, geophysics,
meteorology, and astronomy.

     The scientific paper detailing this discovery is presently in -draft-
form ( 110 pages double spaced ). It's contents indicate that considerabe
urgency is warranted if the concept is correct.  The abstract and conclusions
are contained in separate postings following, plus details on the "NRG
Research Centre".

     Unless specifially reserved, comments received may influence the finished
paper, (with credit to the writer). All comments are welcome, including all
criticism.

  The following DOS adaptation of the NRG (Relativity) Model is
  provided for your consideration. The NRG Model produces effects
  that can be observed in Nature - astronomy, geophysics, meteorology,
  etc.

  One of the model's most distinctive features is the "Square Corners" in
  the equatorial plane. "Pyramid of Cheops" Geometry provides the precise
  schematic for -Breaking of Symmetry- in the equatorial plane of both
  the main "sphere-mid" and the four fractal corner models.

  This model is important because it provides a framework for the
  examination of -many- issues, which presently have no integrated
  solution.

            Relativity Creates Nature's Sacred Geometry

     Albert Einstein spent his last 30 years trying to find a single
theoretical statement that would explain the behaviour of subatomic particles
and the curved geometry of gravity ( ** National Geographic, May 1989, ppg 576
**). The solution is literally "cast in stone".

     "NRG (Energy) THEORY" considered the rotation of particles using the
edges of energy planes as "guiding centres" in sequential "time slices".
Relativistic acceleration changes the centre's order of symmetry of rotation
and the volume traced, enabling  force / space conversion. Sequential energy
plane "slices" describe a complete, closed cosmological model of relativity.

     This study first reviews NRG Theory. It defines the environment for
relativistic transformation, outlines the principles in physics that comprise
the single unit NRG model, and details the geometric changes caused by
acceleration. It then extends the model to multiplex the fractal assembly of
matter. It cites combinations of the compound model's features that occur in
Nature, thereby solving numerous present mysteries.

     The study develops the conclusion that Einstein's formula for energy
E=MC^2 is one quadrant of one Euclidean "time slice" of a relativistic model
that is not presently documented in science. The "Sacred Geometry" of natural
structures and strong energy events in the Universe visibly demonstrate that
Gravity = M C ^ 3 / 3.

VII)  CONCLUSIONS

     Microwave energy creates the "Sacred Geometry" that is fundamental to
Nature's structures. NRG modelling of the behaviour of microwave energy in
natural particle accelerators reconciles disparate observable natural
structures and events to one single physics model where no other viable
explanations exist.

     Cosmologically, the NRG model is useful for solving abstract problems
such as missing mass, the breaking of symmetry, and the very nature of "time".
It supplies the missing "means" and "method of delivery" for Tectonic Strain
Theory (TST) to interconnect physical phenomena to electromagnetism. The NRG
model's fractal assembly of matter has been found physically "cast in stone".

     NRG Theory relativistically unifies the electromagnetic and gravitation
phenomena into one cosmologic model of energy in a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
environment through a force/space analogy using the ratio  "Gravity : Energy =
Volume : 4 * Area".

     The variables in the analogy can be synthesized to show that Einstein's
Euclidean energy plane should be physically placed into the geometric solution
to relativity illustrated by the NRG Model.

                      -------------------------
     NRG Theory correctly suggests that Einstein's energy formula E = M C ^ 2
should be extended to include gravity G = M C ^ 3 / 3.

GEOPOWER.DOC

                     Geo-Power Project

                            by

                   N R G  Research  Group

What is Geo-Power and When Will We Use It?

 - GeoPower is environmentally desirable "clean, green" electricity
   to be eventually generated from subterranean radio frequency
   microwaves. An interesting new approach to energy, coupled with the
   recent discovery of a testable geophysical site indicate that the
   time has come to develop this alternate energy.

How Does It Originate?

 - GeoPower results from the concentration of energy emitted from
   underground at numerous locations on the globe's surface. The globe
   is the equivalent of a tuned harmonic oscillator. It's surface is
   encased in a grid of active microwave energy. Radially rotating
   energy is converted to angular energy which accelerates as it
   approaches Earth's surface. Preliminary evidence shows that the
   same microwave energy is involved in tectonic faulting, movement of
   ocean currents, and bending of grain into the vastly misunderstood
   "crop circles".

What Is the Scientific Background?

 - This energy source was found by comparing geometric markings on
   planetary surfaces with similar patterns generated in an alternate
   physics theory of energy's structure. The existence of this useable
   energy was copyrighted by Thomas Kukkee in NRG Theory in 1990 and
   registered in the National Library of Canada. He has since
   developed it through three phases - the theory, discoveries of
   numerous physical occurrences, and practical applications research.

Who Else Uses It?

 - No one. NRG microwaves have never been understood. Recently, the
   microwaves have been captured in satellite infrared photography.
   The United Nations has been briefed on the existence of this
   undocumented energy source by a NASA consultant Richard C. Hoagland
   as originating from new unknown physics. He has recognized the
   geometric planetary markings that occur as a result of this energy.

How Are Microwaves Converted

 - Microwaves are condensed in local naturally existing physical
   structures in MHD magnetic fields. Further research is required to
   efficiently interface the microwaves with electrical equipment. The
   conversion of microwaves directly to electricity  is understood to
   be 30 % more efficient if the hydraulic phase is bypassed.

What Scale of Electrical Generation Is Possible?

 - Cells of NRG grids concentrate energy from hundreds of square
   kilometres into local areas. Preliminary indications are that large
   scale power plants could be feasible.

What Are The Environmental Consequences?

 - NRG microwave grids are a natural part of the structure of the
   globe. The globe has cells similar to the surface of a soccer ball
   or facets of  a C60 "buckeyball". Tapping Nature's power grid makes
   more sense than combusting fossil fuels or generating nuclear
   waste. There is no effluent and no byproducts. This natural power
   source is understood to be a nearly massless kinetic energy.

   One site located is in a river bed, found because the silt is
mounded into an NRG-specific pattern. At this site, a female salmon
was spawning, guarded by three males. She was apparently utilizing
the microwaves as an overwintering nursery for her eggs. Only one
other fish was observable within two miles upstream or downstream
from this site even using polarized glasses. The site and the fish
were photographed with both VHS format and still cameras. The point
being, of course, that natural energy does not bother Nature.

     Environmental, scientific, and commercial enquiries are
invited from individuals, action groups, corporations and
government agencies.
