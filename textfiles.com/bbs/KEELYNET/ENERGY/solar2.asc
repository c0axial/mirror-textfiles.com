       This information package is about an invention by Alvin  M. Marks to
       convert sunlight to  electric  power.  A  few  years of Research and
       Development are required to bring  the thin film photovoltaic called
       Lumeloid (tm) into production.

       Alvin M. Marks was on President Kennedy's Power Panel  and  owns 120
       patents. He invented  Polarized  film materials, 3D movie technology
       and co-founded Marks Polarized Corporation.   He  received many U.S.
       Government contracts for alternative energy until the early 1980's.

       Studying the initial  phase  used  in the process of  photosynthesis
       Alvin Marks employed  his  knowledge of polarizing film materials to
       design aligned molecular antennae  and  molecular  diodes to convert
       sunlight directly to electric power.

       Lumeloid's (tm) projected  efficiency is 80%, (many  times  that  of
       conventional silicon photovoltaics)  with  an investment cost only a
       fraction of existing  electric power  sources.   Project  Lumeloid's
       (tm) success will revolutionize the electric power industry with low
       cost efficient benign technology.

       Phototherm, Inc., a  Public  Company, OTC, holds license  rights  to
       Alvin Marks' light  to  electric power conversion patents.  Advanced
       Research Development, Inc. is privately  owned  and has an exclusive
       R&D agreement with Phototherm, Inc.

       Research Institute with   Lowell    University   preparing   special
       materials for Marks' electrically-conducting polarized  film.   More
       funds are necessary to expedite Research and Development.

          << The following article is from the "Entrepreneurship Profile"
                 section of "TAIPAN" (magazine?), November 1990 >>

           SOLAR BREAKTHROUGH - MASSACHUSETTS ENTREPRENEUR POINTS WAY TO
                  PROFITS FROM ENVIRONMENTALLY BENIGN TECHNOLOGY

       In just two  and  a half hours enough radiant energy  from  the  sun
       falls onto the  earth  to  supply  all the energy (from all sources)
       consumed by human civilization in an entire year.

       The light that  falls  on a few hundred  square  kilometers  in  the
       Southwestern desert of the United States is enough  to  power all of
       North America. The  problem, however, has always been how to harness
       it.

       The rap against conventional photovoltaic cells (which convert light
       into electricity) has always been  their cost. Conventional silicon-
       based solar cells convert sunlight to electricity at an average cost
       above US$0.30 per kilowatt hour (kwh). That is three  to  five times
       what an average U.S. household pays for power from the local utility
       company.

       It is precisely  this  cost disadvantage that has limited most solar
       applications to small-scale operations  in  remote  areas  far  from
       commercial power mains.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       -> Massachusetts Miracle

       That is, until now. A 78-year old Massachusetts inventor,  Dr. Alvin
       Marks, has come  up  with  a new kind of solar cell that promises to
       produce electricity for less than US$0.02 per kwh.

       If this is true, development of this  technology  could  potentially
       revolutionize the commercial power generation industry. After all,
       conventional power plants are like prisons.  But  nobody  wants  one
       built in their neighborhood.

       On the other  hand,  a  solar plant produces no radiation, smoke, or
       acid rain. Moreover,  its best location  would  be  somewhere  in  a
       desert -- where nobody lives anyway.

       Marks' cost breakthrough  was achieved by radical  new  design  that
       dramatically increases the efficiency of solar conversion. While


                                      Page 2





       conventional cells are  able  to capture and convert only 10% to 25%
       of the sun's energy, Marks' new designs may capture as much as 80%.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       -> Dinner With Alvin

       The genesis of this breakthrough was a dinner conversation that took
       place seven years ago between Marks  and  the  then  Director of the
       Third World Energy Division of the United Nations, Dr. Usmani.

       After complaining about a photovoltaic test project  in  Africa that
       had to be  abandoned  because  it was too expensive and inefficient,
       Usmani turned to Marks and said something  to  the effect of `You're
       an inventor, can't you invent a better photovoltaic cell.'

       Few people would  be  better  equipped to accept such  a  challenge.
       Marks patented his first invention in January 1938. His early work
       lead to what  the  May  1935 issue of "SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN" termed a
       1,000 to 1  cost  reduction  in  the  fabrication  of  materials  to
       polarize light.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       -> Polaroid Precursor

       This cost breakthrough   was   instrumental   in    the   subsequent
       development of polarized  sunglasses  and  Polaroid  film. (In fact,
       Marks was an early rival of Dr. Edwin  Land,  developer  of the Land
       Camera and founder of the Polaroid Corp.)

       In the early 1960s, Marks was science advisor to the  Kennedy  White
       House. Today, he  holds  a total of 120 patents -- a number of which
       have application to solar power generation.

       Marks new solar designs -- dubbed  LEPCON  (Light  to Electric Power
       Converter) and LUMELOID  --  are  built on an extention  of  systems
       commonly used to  receive  microwave transmissions. (On the spectrum
       of electromagnetic energy,  the difference  between  microwaves  and
       visible light is merely that the latter have a higher  frequency and
       a shorter wavelength.)

       Microwaves -- like  other  radio frequency transmissions -- are best
       received using an antenna tuned to  the  wavelength  of the incoming
       signal. (When an  electromagnetic  wave  strikes   an   electrically
       conductive material, it induces an alternating current of the same
       frequency of the incoming wave.)

       In real-world microwave   applications,   the   efficiency  of  this
       connversion approaches 80%.   LEPCON   consists   of   millions   of
       microscopic antennas (tuned  to  the  wavelengths   of  the  visible
       spectrum) embedded in   a   glass  substrate.   (LUMELOID  use  less
       expensive plastic materials.)
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       -> A Thousand Points Of Light

       With microwaves (as well as with radar and radio), however, the same
       tuned antenna will work as well for transmitting a signal as it does
       for receiving it. Operate LEPCON in  reverse  and it becomes a light
       source.

       Marks calls this  reverse  application ELCON (Electricity  to  Light
       Converter). ELCON elements  in a group become a point of light, or a
       pixel.
                                      Page 3





       The same technology  used  to  pack  millions  of  submicron antenna
       elements in a glass or plastic substrate  could be used to produce a
       new kind of  high-definition  TV  (HDTV)  screen  with  much  higher
       resolution than present technology will allow.

       Conventional U.S. TV  uses  525 scanning lines of pixels per screen.
       The most ambitious HDTV schemes yet  proposed would use something on
       the order of 1,250 lines per screen. Using ELCON technology, screens
       using millions of  lines may be possible -- for an 80,000%  increase
       in resolution.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       -> Phototherm, Inc.

       Virtually all these  ideas  and devices have been patented by Marks.
       But lack of funds for the development  of  commercial prototypes has
       been a serious and continuing obstacle.

       To get LUMELOID  off  the  ground,  Marks  formed a public  company.
       Phototherm Inc. (OTC-pink   sheets).   However,  it  is  still  some
       distance away from  a  commercial   product.   Marks   estimates  an
       additional US$300,000 - US$500,000 will be necessary to get LUMELOID
       to the prototype stage.

       While North American interest in solar power has been sliding along
       with oil prices  since the late 1970s, that has not  been  the  case
       elsewhere. Last year,  Marks  made  a  deal  with a Chinese company,
       China Petroleum Engineering Construction Corporation, to develop the
       LUMELOID prototype.

       Phototherm Bahamas Ltd.  has been  established  to  facilitate  this
       endeavor and Chinese citizens will come to the Bahamas  to learn the
       process.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       -> Genius And Fortune

       Because of the  enormous  breadth  and  depth  of  Marks'  work, the
       "TAIPAN" research department believes no 20th century entrepreneur
       or inventor is destined to have  greater  positive  effects  on  the
       daily lives of millions of people. However, revolutionary  ideas are
       not any guarantee of quick commercial success.

       Because so much work remains before any of these ventures are likely
       to reach the  stage  of  a profit-making enterprise, we suspect that
       attractive returns on Phototherm shares may be distant enough to try
       the patience of all but the most tenacious investors.

       However, if war in the Persian Gulf  leads  to  destruction  of  the
       Saudi oil fields, we think promising technologies such as LEPCON and
       LUMELOID would suddenly become clear leaders on the  fast  track  to
       commercial development.

       In the meantime,  however,  investors and entrepreneurs in search of
       more information should  contact   Dr.  Alvin  Marks,  c/o  Advanced

                   INVESTING FOR A CLEANER EARTH AND BIG PAYOFF

                               By Marshall Glickman

       Would you pay 25 cents for a share of a solar technology for which
       Exxon offered $9 million?

       That's the current   price   of    Phototherm    Inc.,   an   Athol,
       Massachusetts, solar technology company which is developing a new
       ultra-efficient process of harnessing the sun's power.

       The founder and brains behind Phototherm is Dr. Alvin  M.  Marks, an
       octogenarian inventor and  entrepreneur  whose  resume reads like an
       award ceremony. Dr. Marks is the holder  of 120 patents, has degrees
       from Cooper Union Institute of Technology, Harvard  University,  and
       M.I.T., and has  served  as  a  scientific  advisor  to  the Kennedy
       Adminstration. His work on polarizing  film  built  Marks  Polarized
       Corp. into a multimillion dollar business.

       Eight years ago Dr. Marks turned his full attention to improving the
       efficiency of solar (photovoltaic) electricity. His  work  lead to a
       patent (the one  for  which Exxon offered $9 million, according to a
       1986 "NEW YORK TIMES" report) that  claims  to  convert  sunlight to
       energy at 80% efficiency -- a cost of one to two cents  per kilowatt
       hour. That's less  than  a  fifth of the present cost of energy from
       fossil fuels and   about  one  twentieth   the   cost   of   current
       photovoltaic systems (which   are  lucky  to  achieve   15   percent
       efficiency). The cost  breakthrough  is  so  incredible,  that  some
       skeptics immediately dismiss Dr. Marks.

       But Dr. Marks  has  made  dramatic   --   almost   unbelievable   --
       improvements in light  technology  before.  The May  1935  issue  of
       "SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN" noted   Marks   created   a   1,000-to-1  cost
       reduction in the fabrication of materials to polarize light. His
       work with Phototherm has also impressed the Electric Power Research
       Institute, the electric  industry's  research  thinktank.  The  EPRI
       recently backed Phototherm  with  $100,000  and  has  plans  to  add
       another $100,000 soon.

       Before you mortgage  the  house  and whip out the checkbook, keep in
       mind that Phototherm is a highly risky  investment.  And I emphasize
       the word highly.  Even though Dr. Marks is supremely  confident  his
       technologies will work,  it  has  never  been  tested  in commercial
       production. Dr. Marks is also eighty-one years old.

       Even if his  patented  design  is indeed  revolutionary  technology,
       until Phototherm has enough money to hire a team of highly qualified
       research assistants, it may be difficult to carry on his work should
       he become ill (his health is excellent). Interest generated  from  a
       recent "BUSINESS WEEK" story on Phototherm may help get the company
       adequately financed, but until the cash comes through Dr. Marks must
       concentrate on raising   money   instead  of  science  and  building
       prototypes.

       Consider investing in Phototherm as you would give money to

                         ADVANCES BRING SOLAR POWER CLOSER
            Researchers Say Solar Will Take Off In Mid-90s, While Athol
                          Scientist Claims A Breakthrough

                        By David L. Chandler -- Globe Staff

       It's not that there's a shortage of energy. In just  two  and a half
       hours, enough sunlight falls on the Earth to supply all of mankind's
       energy needs --  heat,  light, cooking, transportation, industry and
       every other energy-using activity -- for a full year.

       It's there, the hard part is catching it.

       Finding a practical and economical  way  to  harness  all that free,
       ubiquitous energy has challenged scientists and engineers  since the
       energy crisis of  the  early  1970s awakened interest in alternative
       power sources.

       No major breakthroughs emerged during  the  70s, but researchers say
       new methods developed  in the last few years, and  innovations  just
       now emerging from  the  laboratories, will make solar power -- which
       is already competitive  in  some  applications  --  an  increasingly
       important contributor to the world's energy supply.

       Most people in  the solar energy field expect it will  "really  take
       off in about 1993 to 1995," said electrical engineer Richard Swanson
       of Stanford University,  who  has  developed  what are presently the
       world's most efficient solar cells.

       For a home or farm in remote areas  not  served  by  power  lines, a
       solar-power system "right  now is cost-effective against  a  diesel-
       power system," the  present  standard  in small electric generators,
       according to Satyen Deb, manager  of  photovoltaic  research for the
       federally-funded Solar Energy Research Institute in Colorado.

       And solar cells have always played an important role  in  the  space
       program; they are  the  standard  source of power for satellites and
       other long-term applications. As the US space station takes shape in
       orbit, their role  will become ever  more  important  --  especially
       since the only  real alternative, small nuclear generators,  may  no
       longer be acceptable  because  of  fears  of  what  might  happen to
       nuclear fuel in the event of a Challenger-type launch accident.

       But solar technology  will  really   take   off   when   it  becomes
       competitive with other kinds of power plants that feed  the nation's
       electrical transmission grid. "By the turn of the century, we should
       make a strong  penetration  in  the grid market," Deb predicted last
       week.

       Ways of harnessing  the  sun  span the gamut of technology, from the
       simple to the futuristic, and all have a part to play.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       *** At the  simple  end, there are  already  several  million  solar
           stoves, consisting  of  dish-shaped  aluminum reflectors,  being
           used in  India.  They  have  made  a  dent  in  the  problem  of
           deforestation -- obtaining  fuel  for  cooking  is  one  of  the
           principal reasons for cutting trees in developing countries.

       *** At the  futuristic  end,  an inventor in Athol  has  patented  a
           completely new kind of solar-electric cell that he says could be
           far more  efficient  and far cheaper than the silicon panels now
           in use,  making  solar  power   practial   for  everything  from
           individual homes  and  farms  to  huge  solar installations  for
           utilities.
       *** And in  between,  improvements in silicon solar cells promise to
           bring down costs enough to make this technology competitive with
           other power sources. Prominent  among them is the development of
           "amorphous silicon," a glass-like material that  can  be  coated
           onto a  thin plastic sheet to replace the expensive pure silicon
           crystals of traditional solar cells.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Potentially the most exciting development is the solar cell invented
       by Athol-based Alvin M. Marks, a 77-year-old inventor with more than
       100 patents to  his  name. If his  calculations  are  right,  Marks'
       system could provide  all  of  the nation's electrical  needs  at  a
       fraction of today's cost with the equivalent of a single 100-mile-
       square of solar panels located in a sunny desert area -- eliminating
       the need for  coal,  oil,  or  nuclear  plants  with their attendant
       hazards.

       Marks, who was  an  energy  consultant  to  President  Kennedy,  was
       inspired to develop  his  solar power system during  a  conversation
       about the great  need  for  solar power in developing nations, where
       sunlight tends to be abundant and power plants scarce.

       "About five years ago," Marks said in an interview, "we were sitting
       with an official from the United Nations talking about photovoltaics
       in the Third World. He said,`isn't  there  something  you  can do to
       make them more efficient?'"

       Marks agreed to  think  about it, and before long he  had  concluded
       there was a way. His first solar patent, for a glass-plate collector
       he calls Lepcon  (light  to electric power converter), was issued in
       1984. It was followed in 1986 by a patent for a lower-cost, plastic-
       sheet version called Lumeloid. His  latest  patent  on  an  improved
       version of the technology was granted last month.

       Although some scientists  question  his  figures,   Marks  says  his
       technology could theoretically  have  an efficiency of 80 percent --
       that is, 80 percent of the sun's  power  reaching  the cell would be
       converted to usable  electricity. By comparison, the  most  advanced
       design silicon cell in Swanson's laboratory at Stanford has produced
       about 28 percent   efficiency   and  available  commercial  versions
       average about 10 to 12 percent.

       The basic technology of Marks' cells  is  a  modification of systems
       used to pick   up   microwave   transmissions,  which   do   achieve
       efficiencies of 80 percent in real world applications, not just in

       the lab. Critics,  however,  point  out  that  microwaves  used  for
       communications are all of the same  wavelength,  while sunlight is a
       mixture of many wavelengths, or colors, of light.

       Marks says he has taken this into account, because  his  cells would
       consist of millions  of  tiny  "antennas" of different lengths, each
       tuned to a different wavelength of  light  so  that among them, they
       would pick up light of all colors.

       Some critics also  question Marks' optimism about  how  quickly  the
       technology could be  made  practical for manufacturing in commercial
       quantities. Marks thinks one version  could  be in production within
       two years, while others think it may be quite a few years off.

       No one, however, disputes the principle involved, which  is based on
       well-established concepts.

       Conventional solar cells  generate electricity with an array of tiny
       transistor-like areas of semiconductor  material  on a silicon chip,
       which absorb energy  from light to break electrons  loose  and  send
       them toward one terminal of the cell, producing an electric current.

       Marks' cells will  use  an  array of even tinier metal strips, which
       serve as antennas to pick up energy  from light in much the same way
       that a radio antenna picks up energy from radio waves.

       The current produced in each antenna is intially AC, or alternating
       current, unlike the DC (direct current) of conventional  cells,  but
       tiny diodes --  one-way  electrical  "valves" -- in the gaps between
       antennas would convert the current to DC.

       Lumeloid, the cheaper but less-durable  version of his system, is an
       offshoot of a  polarizing  filter  that was Marks' first  invention.
       His was the   first   man-made  material  commercially  produced  to
       polarize, predating Edwin Land's  polarizing  filters.  One  version
       developed later by  Marks  is  still  in production  for  polarizing
       sunglasses and 3-D movie glasses.

       Light can be  thought  of  as  waves  or vibrations, and in ordinary
       light these vibrations move every which way. In polarized light, the
       vibrations all move  in  the  same   direction   --   vertically  or
       horizontally.

       The production of the polarizing filters, and of Lumeloid,  seems to
       have more in  common  with  candy  making  than  with the high-tech,
       clean-room process used to make silicon cells.

       "You make a syrup," Marks explains,  of  chemicals  called  polymers
       that form long-chain   molecules,   suspended  in  an   electrically
       conductive material.  "You  stretch  it  like  taffy,  and  all  the
       molecules become parallel."  In   a  simple  large-scale  way,  this
       process yields millions of the microscopic chain-like  molecules all
       lined up in  a neat grid that can filter out all the light rays that
       vibrate in one direction, allowing  those  that vibrate in the other
       to pass through  -- producing polarized light. By  simply  adding  a
       different kind of  chemical  to  the  recipe  -- a "donor- receptor"
       molecule -- the polarizing filter  becomes  a solar generator, Marks
       says.

       Marks expects the  lightweight plastic Lumeloid, manufactured by the
       "taffy-pulling" method to be the  first  of  his  solar materials to
       reach the production stage. If he can raise the financial backing he
       needs He is negotiating with state and federal agencies  as  well as
       private investors), he  thinks  a  prototype  could be made in about
       nine months.

       "The reason I'm so sure about Lumeloid,"  Marks  said last week, "is
       because I've been involved in polarizing material for  decades,  and
       the materials are not that different."

       Others are not  so  sure.  Elliot  Berman,  chief scientist for Arco
       Solar company, a maker of silicon  cells,  said in an interview that
       "it's a good idea, I just don't think he can build it."

       "It's not that  it's  impossible,"  Berman  added,  "it's  just  not
       practical at the   present  time.  It's  pretty  far  away."  Berman
       conceded, however, that  he is not  familiar  with  the  details  of
       Marks' manufacturing plans.

       Edgar Demeo, head  of  solar power research for the  Electric  Power
       Research Institute, takes a middle position, saying the Marks system
       is "an elegant  approach  to converting solar energy" and "is a very
       nice idea and is worthy of some basic  research at this point." But,
       he added, it  may  take "a number of years" to become  a  commercial
       product.

       In the meantime, Berman sees other developments that could reach the
       market sooner and   make   substantial   inroads  in  a  variety  of
       applications. "I think  there are  some  substantial  progress,"  he
       said.

       Solar cells have dropped in price from about $20 per  watt of output
       15 years ago  to  about  $5  per watt today, and Berman sees the new
       amorphous silicon cells -- especially  a  version  he  calls "tandem
       cells," where amorphous  (glasslike  instead  of crystalline)  cells
       sensitive to one  color  of light are paired with cells sensitive to
       another color in order to improve  efficiency  -- cutting that price
       in half within the next two and a half years.  That  would  bring it
       close to the  range  of  other  power  sources, which generally cost
       between $1 and $2 per watt.

       When that happens, Berman said, solar  power  will  have reached the
       price level "where  we think this will be practical  for  widespread
       use.
