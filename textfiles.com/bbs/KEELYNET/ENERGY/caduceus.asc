       CADUCEUS WOUND COIL EXPERIMENTS

       Certain experiments, not  as carefully controlled as the above, were
       carried out by  independent researchers  with  caduceus-wound  coils
       (1). This was  also  called a "Tensor" coil by its  main  proponent,
       Wilbert Smith.

       The caduceus coil,  illustrated  in fig.  #1,  basically consists of
       ordinary  insulated  copper  wire  wound in  a double-helix around a
       ferrite core. THIS  COIL  HAS  REPEATEDLY   BEEN  FOUND  TO  VIOLATE
       ESTABLISHED LAWS OF ELECTROMAGNETICS AND HERTZIAN WAVE THEORY WHEN A
       HIGH FREQUENCY CURRENT IS INJECTED INTO IT.

       First. this apparatus has zero impedance - unlike an  ordinary coil.
       when fed electrical  energy the wire in the Tensor coil does not get
       hot.

       Secondly. it has infinite resonance  - unlike an ordinary coil which
       will resonate chiefly  at  its  natural  fundamental  frequency  and
       weakly on the  2nd  or  3rd  harmonic, the Tensor coil is capable of
       resonating strongly on any number  of frequencies randomly spaced in
       the spectrum.  The  signal pumped into  such a coil strangely enough
       cannot be quantified  (detected)  by  standard RF (radio  frequency)
       detection apparatus. Many   "Ham"  radio  operators  and  electronic
       technicians who have used these coils,  are  completely  baffled  by
       them. One radio amateur found that with two such coils,  one used as
       a transmitter and the other as a receiver, the second would not pick
       up the signal from the first unless they were precisely aligned.

       For the signal to be transmitted the alignment had to be as critical
       as that of a laser beam.

       CADUCEUS COIL LEVITATES

       A few investigators  have  also reported unexpected bizarre inertial
       effects in conjunction with these  coils.  One  researcher activated
       his caduceus coil   with   pulsed  bursts  of  microwave   frequency
       whereupon it appeared  to  lift  itself  up  by  its  own bootstraps
       executing a periodic series of little  hops  off the ground. Why the
       coil would jump like this or exhibit the other weird  effects  noted

                                    Page 1

       above, has no explanation under standard electromagnetic theory, and
       must be attributed  to  the field effect produced by the unique coil
       winding.

       CADUCEUS COIL CHARACTERISTICS

       Looking at this   coil  configuration  carefully  we  see  that  the
       oppositely wound wires of the double  helix will cross each other on
       the opposite sides of the core's diameter with each  complete  turn.
       Hence, the coil  will  have  two  rows of bumps formed where the two
       wires cross, the rows placed diametrically  opposite  one another on
       the core.

       Researchers claim that it is important for these crossover  bumps to
       lie in a  straight  line. Now, when the high frequency current flows
       in opposite directions through the  two  wires,  the magnetic fields
       essentially cancel on  the  sides of the coil but  on  the  top  and
       bottom where the  crossovers  are, the fields overlap forming on the
       top magnetic vectors orientated in  one  direction  parallel  to the
       coil axis, and on the bottom vectors of the same magnitude  oriented
       oppositely to those  on top. If we observe the coil from the side we
       then see that the consecutive vectors along the coil axis would form
       several closed toroidal loops circulating  into the ferrite core. As
       we stated elsewhere, Wilbert Smith himself while experimenting  with
       the Tensor coil,  claimed to have recorded time differential effects
       between the coil field and the outer  environment.  This phenomenon,
       as well as non-coupling of signal between coils, may  arise from the
       unique trapped toroidal magnetic field described above.
