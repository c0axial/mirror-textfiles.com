             This fascinating file is from our archives and I finally
            found time to type it up.  We kind of sat on it due to the
            nature but it is definitely Keely-type information since it
               deals with the "centre of gravity" and how it can be
                             "artificially displaced".
             I won't go into the details of that but will leave it to
             the other Keely researchers who understand such concepts.
           We have spoken with several people who felt the Israelis have
        some kind  of "secret weapon" ranging from UFO's to Scalar weapons.
           This is the "hardest" evidence we have found of such claims.
             As always, we would GREATLY  APPRECIATE  the  sharing  of  any
            information related to this file, particularly technically
             based articles or hints of such, if you get the drift....

                              Israel's Secret Weapon?
                  A Toronto inventor may hold the key to Entebbe
                                  by David Jones

       Two books have now been written on the daring raid which rescued 103
       hijack hostages from  Entebbe  Airport  on July 3,  1976.   Numerous
       interviews and official explanations have been given, yet the puzzle
       remains.  How did  the  Israeli  rescue  mission manage to ELUDE the
       radar of six nations lying beneath  or  alongside  the  flight path,
       including that of Uganda.

       The answer to  the  Entebbe  mystery  may  lie  with  a  64-year-old
       appliance repairman and  heart  patient.   The  first  hint  of  Sid
       Hurwich's connection with the raid  filtered  out  last  June  at  a
       ceremony in Toronto's  Besh  Tzedec  synagogue,  where  Hurwich  was
       presented with the  award  of  Protectors  of the State of Israel on
       behalf of the Zionist Organization  of  Canada for a secret military
       device he had given Israel SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.  Six  weeks later an
       item appeared in  the Tornont Star linking the Hurwich device to the
       raid on Entebbe.  The wire services  picked it up and the story took
       off round the world.

       The most DETAILED ACCOUNT appeared in FOREIGN REPORT  (we would LOVE
       A COPY OF  THIS  ARTICLE  at KEELYNET!, HINT, HINT!), a confidential
       diplomatic journal produced  by  England's   prestigious   ECONOMIST
       magazine.  In an  unsigned  article  apparently  based   on  Israeli
       sources, the publication reports that "all that could be learned

                                      Page 1





       officially was that  [Hurwich's]  invention  had  been  used  in the
       Israeli raid at  Entebbe  last  year."    The   article  claims  the
       invention

            "sends out electronic rays to ALTER the NATURAL  COMPOSITION of
             magnetic fields  and CENTRES OF GRAVITY of weapons, instrument
             dials and mechanical devices.

             On the Hurwich principle there was no reason why the new BEAMS
             could not reach and DISABLE  tanks,  ground-to-ground missiles
             and complete radar systems.

             The beams could also be TACKED TOGETHER to form  a SCREEN that
             would make  WHOLE  ZONES  SAFE  from  bombs  or missiles.  The
             Israeli's will NOT divulge  what  tests  have been run, or how
             the Hurwich RAY has been developed."

       According to his  daughter, Sylvia Winkler, Hurwich  "was  around  9
       when he started  buying  broken  bicycles and putting them together,
       and when anybody threw out appliances, he would pick them up and put
       them together."

       By 1934, with no training beyond  high  school,  Hurwich  had  won a
       reputation as the  first  private appliance repairmen  in  Canada  -
       before that only the manufacturers did repairs.  By the beginning of
       the Second World  War  he was known as a man "able to fix just about
       anything."  Ontario Hydro pulled strings to keep him out of the army
       and built a public service department around him.

       Meanwhile, with government   restrictions    on   metals   used   in
       appliances, the repair business took off.  By 1947  he  had built it
       up into Shock  Electric, which remains one of the largest businesses
       of its kind in Toronto.  In another  building, he started SidCo Co.,
       devoted to making  electrical parts.  When a heart  attack  in  1950
       just about killed  him,  he  sold  the  business  and  went  into  a
       comfortable retirement at the age of 36.

       The idea for the Hurwich ray came  to  him one evening in 1969 as he
       read about a rash of robberies from bank night-deposit  vaults.  "It
       just clicked what  to  do," Hurwich says.  "I picked up the phone to
       the police - I knew a lot of the  boys  -  and I told them I think I
       can stop those thieveries in about half a hour."

       Hurwich went to work in his basement with $50 worth  of spare parts,
       and within a  week had assembled a working model to test his theory.
       Inspector Bill Bolton,  then  head  of  the  police  hold-up  squad,
       assembled police and  bank  security  officials at  Hurwich's  home.
       "All I can  recall,"  says  Bolton "is that it was under the table -
       the device, whatever it was - and  there  was  a  bedspread over the
       table.  He FROZE  MY  SERVICE  REVOLVER.   You  COULDN'T   PULL  THE
       TRIGGER, you COULDN'T  LIFT  IT  UP  OFF  THE  TABLE and even on the
       table, you COULDN'T PULL THE TRIGGER."

       Hurwich continues: "And  then I  said  'Now  take  a  look  at  your
       watches.'"  I remember one of them said, "When did this happen?" and
       I said, "The  minute you walked through that door.   You  walked  in
       there about 25  minutes ago.  Now look at your watches.  You're late
       about 25 minutes."

       As the security  officers  filed  out  of  his  home, Hurwich's wife
       overheard one of them suggest that the army should be told about the
       device.  "That was the first time it ever entered my mind for war or
       army purposes or anything like that," Hurwich says.  He went back to
       work in his  basement.   When  he  felt  the  device  was  ready  he
       contacted a brother  living in Israel.  Hurwich has  never  been  to
       Israel himself but  he  felt "they needed it more than anybody, what
       with the Arabs saying they'd push  everyone  into the sea."  Hurwich
       received a visit  shortly  afterward  from two high-ranking  Israeli
       officers.  After a  brief  demonstration  they  walked  out with the
       working model and every plan and design Hurwich had.

       Hurwich insists his device is not  really  an invention.  He says he
       simply "took one of the oldest BASIC principles of  electricity  and
       put it to  a  different use."  Which principle he won't say, just as
       he refuses to  discuss  how the device  works.   It  only  works  on
       objects that WILL CARRY A CURRENT, he says.  It can be aimed and its
       range depends on its power source.

       "Any magnet will stop a watch," explains Dr. Howard White, a Toronto
       consulting engineer.  "It  sounds  to me like a very  high-intensity
       electromagnetic field that  he  is able to PROJECT, but I don't know
       how he is generating it."  White shakes his head skeptically.  "From
       jamming a few guns to jamming electronic  equipment at long range is
       a very  large leap.  But anything's possible."

       Hurwich has never  patented  the  device  -  he doesn't  believe  in
       patents.  "It's so easy to copy," he says.  "I've copied things from
       patents.  Just make  a  few  minor changes where they'd have a tough
       time in court proving I'd broken the  patent."   Nor has he received
       any money for his invention.  Oppenheimer and Co. of  New York wrote
       recently to "offer  any  service  to  assist  you in determining the
       commercial feasibility of your work,  and exploring avenues to bring
       your work to useful commercial purposes."  Hurwich  says,  "at  this
       stage money doesn't enter my mind.  I am not a youngster and I can't
       take it with me."

       Vangard Note

            Assuming Mr. Hurwich is still alive, he would be about 74 years
            old by  now.   We  wonder if he might be willing to discuss the
            device further NOW?  If anyone out there in Toronto wants to
            do some research, we would  all  appreciate  any  feedback  you
            could provide.   Also,  we  understand  that   a  beam  can  be
            projected from   a   POLARIZED   (usually   circular)  antenna.
            However, how it could affect  a field RATHER than just anything
            in its beamed path is curious.
