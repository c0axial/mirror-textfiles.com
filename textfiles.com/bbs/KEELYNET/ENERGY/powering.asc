                                  RINGS OF POWER

       There's been a  nuclear attack.  An incoming warhead has just struck
       a key U.S. defense site and knocked  out  the  region's  power grid,
       leaving the country's  ground-based missile-defense  system  without
       power.  In the  meantime, the United States has less than 10 seconds
       to fire laser weapons at the next round of incoming missiles.  Where
       will the power come from?  An emergency  electrical  generator takes
       15 minutes to  spin  up,  and  power  is  required  instantly.   The
       solution: tap into  giant  energy-storage  rings that can deliver an
       awesome 1,000 megawatts to the lasers within 30 milliseconds.

       These storage rings do not exist  yet,  but  the  Strategic  Defense
       Initiative Organization (SDIO) plans to build a football-field sized
       prototype by the end of 1994.

       The heart of the undergound ring, called a superconducting magnetic
       energy-storage (SMES) ring,  is  a superconducting  coil  cooled  by
       liquid helium to  temperatures  nearing  absolute  zero.   AT  those
       temperatures the coil will have no  electrical  resistance,  and the
       current can be stored almost indefinitely.

       Energy storage rings  could  also  serve  an  important   role   for
       utilities.  By storing  excess power generated during off-peak hours
       and releasing it into the grid during  peak  hours,  the  ring could
       increase utility efficiency.

       Experts believe that a SMES unit could be built almost anywhere, and
       because it would have no moving parts, it would be easy to maintain.
       And if efforts succeed in developng high-temperature superconductors
       [July '87, April '88], refrigeration costs will drop  substantially,
       making a SMES system more practical in smaller sizes.

       "I've been trying  for eighteen years to get funding to build a SMES
       for a large utility," says Roger Boom, director of the University of
       Wisconsin's Applied Superconducting Center in Madison.  A portly man
       with glasses and a fringe of gray-white  hair,  he was not dissuaded
       when the funds  did not materialize.  But then came  SDIO  with  new
       reasons for investing in the technology.

       "We need a system that will provide about one gigawatt of power

                                      Page 1





       available immediately when  the battle starts," explains Capt.  Paul
       Filios, technical adviser to the Defense  Nuclear  Agency (DNA), the
       agency overseeing the  SMES project for SDIO.  "We  can't  get  that
       kind of power straight from the power grid.  For one, the grid might
       not be there  after  an  attack.   And  secondly, we need the energy
       equivalent of what a nuclear power plant produces in a fraction of a
       second."  The actual figures are  classified,  but  a  free-electron
       laser weapon [Dec.   87] would require at least 1,000  megawatts  of
       electricity in 3/100 of a second.

       The heart of a SMES is the current-carrying conductor that is coiled
       around the ring  550  times.  The number of coiled conductors varies
       from one to  four,  depending on  the  design.   Each  conductor  is
       composed of tens of thousands of 27-millimeter-wide  filaments  made
       from superconducting niobium-titanium  alloy and embedded in copper.
       In Boom's design,  these  filaments   are   embedded  in  unalloyed,
       extremely pure aluminum,  a soft material about the  consistency  of
       toothpaste that is    an   extremely   good   conductor.    If   the
       superconductor warms up slightly  and  becomes  resistant, the high-
       purity aluminum will carry the current.

       Keeping it cool

       Another conductor concept being developed by Bechtel National in San
       Francisco uses a ropelike cable of superconducting strands contained
       in a stainless-steel tube.  The voids in the tube  are  filled  with
       liquid helium to keep the conductor at 1.8 degrees Kelvin (minus 456
       degrees F).

       To ward off warm-up in Boom's design, the coil will be surrounded by
       a vacuum vessel   that   acts  like  a  giant  thermos  bottle  with
       superfluid liquid helium inside.   Moving  outward from the thermos,
       several heat shields are cooled to temperatures progressively higher
       than 1.8 degrees K and further protect the coil.

       In November 1987   SDIO   (through  DNA)  awarded  two   $15-million
       contracts to develop  plans for a test SMES unit.  One contract went
       to Ebasco Services  in New York  and  the  other  to  Bechtel.   One
       company will be chosen in the spring of 1990 to build the device. It
       will have a  300-foot  diameter and be capable of storing  about  20
       megawatt-hours of electricity--enough  to power 1,000 100-watt light
       bulbs for 200 hours.  The model  must  operate  in  two  modes: fast
       discharge for the ground-based laser (400 to 1,000 megawatts for 100
       seconds), and slow  discharge  for utility applications  (10  to  25
       megawatts for two hours).

       The design must  also solve less obvious problems.  When the SMES is
       first cooled down to super-low operating  temperatures,  the  entire
       ring, including the coil and aluminum support structure, will shrink
       several feet and tend to move inward toward the ring's  center.  But
       if the ring needs maintenance, the liquid helium will be drained out
       and the ring  will  warm  up,  causing  it to expand.  To accomodate
       strain on the coil, the ring must have some radial leeway.

       One idea championed by Boom's group is to have two conductors and an
       aluminum support structure between  them  ripple radially around the
       ring (see drawing).   "The  nodes  of  the ripple will  be  fastened
       through struts to  the  rock wall," says Boom.  "When the coil cools
       down, those nodes stay fixed while  the  radius  between the ripples
       contracts."

       Terry Walsh, Bechtel's   project  manager,  finds  fault  with  this
       rippled support design.  "As the  coil  cools  down it's going to be
       pulling against the point where it's restrained," he says.  Walsh is
       concerned that these  high-stress points will cause  strain  on  the
       conductor as well  as  dangerous  hot  spots from friction.  He says
       that Bechtel is  studying  an  alternative   approach   in  which  a
       telescoping support structure absorbs coil shrinkage and expansion.

       Ring sharing

       The benefits associated with SMES are wide ranging.  "With SMES, the
       utility can operate all plants continuously at one  hundred  percent
       efficiency," says Boom.   And  in  the event of a generator failure,
       "the power control equipment can prevent a blackout by switching the
       unit from charging to discharging  in thirty milliseconds," he adds.
       Boom also says that SMES could make it simpler for  utilities to buy
       power from intermittent    alternate   energy   sources,   such   as
       cogenerators and wind and solar power plants.

       Where would a  SMES  site  be located?   "It  depends  on  what  the
       facility is going to be used for," says Filios.   Although  a  laser
       weapon probably would  not  be  located  right  next  to an electric
       utility, it would be more economical  if the two shared a SMES.  The
       reason: A SMES  is  only  economical  if  it's  used   continuously.
       Otherwise, the savings  from  generating  efficiency are lost to the
       costs of refrigerating  the  coil.    a   large  5,000-megawatt-hour
       facility would require  a  1-1/2-mile-diameter  exclusion  zone,  so
       populated areas are out.  This is because as the superconductor
       cools down it  generates  strong magnetic forces.  The aluminum ring
       must also be buried in a bedrock trench to counterract these forces.

       Although the free-spending military  has  firm  plans  for SMES, the
       trick in persuading a frugal utility to build is to reduce operating
       costs.  One way  of  achieving  this is with the new  generation  of
       high-temperature ceramic superconductors.    "Without  refrigerating
       cost constraints, smaller  SMES units  could  be  economical,"  says
       Boom.  So far   the  current-carrying  capacity  of   these   warmer
       superconductors is not  high enough to be useful in a SMES facility.
       But the pace of developments in the field lends credence to their
       possible use in the future.

       Boom is optimistic that economical  SMES  rings could have even more
       exotic applications: storing energy for space platforms  or powering
       rail guns or tanks.
