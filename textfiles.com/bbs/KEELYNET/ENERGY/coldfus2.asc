                      Cold Fusion Lecture - broad new theory

       WASHINGTON (UPI) -- Two physicists said Thursday they  had developed
       a theory that   could   explain   some  of  the  puzzling  phenomena
       persistently produced by disputed ``cold fusion'' experiments.

       The experiments did  not  produce   excess  energy  through  nuclear
       fusion, but instead  by  a  new  type  of  nuclear   reaction   that
       scientists say could   possibly   harness  to  produce  power,  said
       Michigan physicists Frederick Mayer and John Reitz.

       The reaction may result from production of a new type of particle
       dubbed a ``hydron,'' which could interract with metal to produce a
       nuclear reaction at room temperature, they said.

       The pair described the theory at  a  news  conference in Boston, one
       day after presenting  a  paper  published in the Journal  of  Fusion
       Technology at a seminar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
       in Cambridge, Mass.

       Lawrence Lidsky, a nuclear engineer at MIT who attended the seminar,
       said the theory  was  interesting  but  needed  to  be  confirmed by
       experiments.

       '`Nobody ran out  of the room screaming,  'He's  got  it,'''  Lidsky
       said.  ``It's interesting but the theory makes a lot  of assumptions
       and requires several leaps of faith.''

       One of the appealing aspects of the theory, however, is that it
       should be able to be tested fairly easily, he said.

       ``There are some nifty tests that could be done to see if the theory
       is correct or not that should be fairly definitive,'' he said.

       Meanwhile, Mills Technologies  of  Lancaster, Pa., (see COLDFUS1.ZIP
       on KeelyNet) also  held  a news conference  Thursday  to  claim  the
       ``cold fusion'' results were actually from a non-nuclear reaction

                                      Page 1





       that produces energy through the contraction of hydrogen atoms.

       Company president Randell Mills said Fusion Technology had agreed to
       publish a paper describing his work, which would be presented at a
       meeting of the American Chemical Society in New York in August.

       Chemists B. Stanley Pons and Norman Fleischmann created a worldwide
       uproar in 1989  when  they  announced that they had produced nuclear
       fusion in a simple experiment at room  temperature at the University
       of Utah.

       Scientists had thought enormous pressure and very high temperatures
       would be needed to produce fusion -- the reaction  that  powers  the
       sun that researchers  have  been  trying  to  harness  as  an energy
       source.

       Pons and Fleischmann's claims largely  have  been  discredited.  But
       some scientists have  continued  to  report  detecting  hints  of  a
       possible nuclear reaction  produced  by  the  experiments  that they
       could not explain.

       Pons and Fleischmann's experiment involved running electricity
       through jars containing rods made  of the metal palladium and a form
       of water that has an extra hydrogen atom.

       The pair theorized the electrical current drove deuterium atoms in
       the water into the palladium until the deuterium became so tightly
       packed the atoms fused -- releasing excess energy.

       In the new theory, deuterium could react with metals like palladium
       to form unstable  neutral particles dubbed ``hydrons,''  which  then
       could react with  the  palladium in a nuclear reaction that produces
       excess heat.

       ``What he's saying is people were looking for the wrong reaction.
       It's not a form of fusion but a form  of  nuclear reaction,'' Lidsky
       said.

       ``If it were true, it would explain a number of phenomena that are
       puzzling,'' he said, adding: ``Can you use this to make power? Lord
       knows.'' Mayer is president of Mayer Applied Research  Inc.  in  Ann
       Arbor.

       Reitz is an Ann Arbor consultant who taught physics at Case Western
       Reserve University from 1954 to 1965.

                                Cold Fusion Lecture
             broad new theory Theory Suggests Cold Fusion May Be Real
                                  by John Travis

       Perhaps rewakening a controversy which stunned the world over two
       years ago, a  Michigan  physicist yesterday at MIT presented a broad
       new theory that may explain the sporadic  and  puzzling  results  of
       cold fusion experiments,   as   well  addressing  other   intriguing
       problems such as  excess  planetary heat and the presence of tritium
       in volcanic emissions.

       In 1989, two Utah chemists shocked the scientific community with
       their announcement of room-temperature fusion-in-a-bottle.

       Attempts to duplicate  the  experiment  proved largely unsuccessful,
       prompting most researchers to dimiss the original report and the few
       others that followed as incorrect.  Still,  in  the  face  of strong
       skepticism and even disdain from the majority of physicists, a small
       band of believers  have  continued to experiment and  have  reported
       some unusual results.

       Speaking before a small audience at a lecture sponsored by MIT's
       Laboratory for Nuclear Science, Dr. Frederic J. Mayer, a plasma
       physicist with his own company in Ann Arbor, MI, detailed a paper,
       appearing in next  month's issue of Fusion Technology, that attempts
       to explain the experimental inconsistencies  that have been observed
       over the past 24 months.

       Fusion, the process  which  powers  the  sun,  has   a   number   of
       established pathways, the  most  common  being  the  collison of two
       hydrogen atoms which produces a helium atom and a burst of energy,

       However, this new theory bypasses  fusion  reactions  and proposes a
       novel energy-producing nuclear reaction that involves a new class of
       atomic particles not yet directly detected.

       Mayer's paper, co-authored with theoretical physicist Dr. John R.
       Reitz, suggests that  the  excess  heat  and other nuclear  products
       detected in various  cold  fusion  experiments are not the result of
       fusion, but instead a reaction involving an isotope switch.

       Isotopes are atoms that are chemically identical, but have different
       numbers of neutrons.  For example,  carbon has a number of isotopes.
       A carbon atom may have up to twelve or more neutrons  in its various
       isotopic forms.

       An isotope that  is  stripped  of  a  neutron, or picks ups one, can
       often release energy. These reactions,  which  Mayer  calls Resonant
       Direct Nuclear Reactions, may be the explanation for the cold fusion
       phenomenon, according to the new theory.

       There are a number of these isotope reactions, many of them occuring
       in metals that  have  been  accused  of  contaminating  cold  fusion
       experiments. Since the level of contamination can vary widely, Mayer
       suggests this may be one explanation for the irreproducibity of many
       experiments.

       "The primary nuclear actions are not the conventional d-d fusion
       reactions, but are RDNRs," Mayer told the gathered audience, "The
       contaminants are driving the system."

       Mayer divides the  RDNRs  into two categories, tritium producers and
       tritium consumers. Tritium  is an  extremely  rare  isotope  of  the
       hydrogen atom which normally has a single proton.

            (An isotope is one of two or more nuclides that  have  the same
             number of protons in their nuclei.
             Atomic hydrogen  has  one  electron  and  one  proton, the two
             "normal" isotopes of hydrogen are Deuterium (mass number 2,


                                      Page 3




             also known as HEAVY WATER) and Tritium (mass number
             3 and radiocative)......Vangard)

       Tritium, in addition to the positively charged proton, has two extra
       neutrons in the  nucleus  and  has  been  accused  of  being another
       contaminant in the experiments.

       In Mayer's isotope  switch,  tritium   is  converted  to  deuterium,
       another form of hydrogen that has a single neutron  plus the proton,
       or vice-versa.

       When tritium is  transformed  into  deuterium,  a  freed  neutron is
       available for a metal atom, creating two isotope switches overall.

       The metal, perhaps platinum or uranium, can also lose a neutron,
       allowing a deuterium atom to be  converted  to  tritium.  It  is the
       isotope switch in the metals that release the excess energy.

       While the process appears simple and obvious, there is an obstacle
       most physicists thought   prevented   such  nuclear   reactions--the
       Coulomb barrier.

       This barrier is  similar to the repulsion that magnets can have with
       each other and occurs when particles  of  similar charge are brought
       together. The tritium, or deuterium, must be very close to the metal
       atoms before they can trade neutrons.

       Yet, the positive  proton  is  repulsed  by  the  large   number  of
       similarly charged protons  in  the metal atoms and the reactions are
       prevented from occuring.

       But, as Mayer explains in the most controversial part of the new
       theory, the proton  in  the  the   tritium   or   deuterium  can  be
       neutralized, which allows the atoms to evade the Coulomb barrier and
       procede with their resonant direct nuclear reactions (RDNRs).

       To perform this magic, Mayer and Reitz have theorized a new class of
       particles they call "hydrons" or virtual particles  (the second name
       is avoided since  it  has  been  used  for other atomic particles as
       well).

       According to Mayer,  a  hydron  is   an  unstable,  compact  neutral
       particle that sometimes  occurs  when an electron interacts  with  a
       proton.

       In effect, the electron and proton cancel each other out, creating a
       "virtual" neutron.  If  the  proton in tritium can be neutralized in
       this way, the Coulumb barrier would  no  longer be an impediment and
       the nuclear reactions would occur.

       However, these hydrons have not been directly observed and many in
       the audience   were   unconvinced   that   such   a  proton-electron
       interaction could exist.  Mayer  could  offer only indirect evidence
       for the hydrons, but pointed out they  provided the best explanation
       for the variety of experimental data.

       "Small compact objects that are neutral appear from  the  data to be
       present in nature,"  said  Mayer,  "A compact object like this could
       solve a lot of problems."

       The absence of certain helium isotopes and gamma radiation have been
       key arguments against  cold  fusion  proponents,  since  the two are
       typically produced in the accepted fusion pathways.

       However, the new theory offers numerous routes in which no radiation
       would be expected, and none of the reactions would produce helium.

       This fact may help solve another, older mystery involving the Earth
       itself.  Only about half of the earth's  interior energy, geothermal
       heat, can be accounted for from measurements of helium.

       Mayer suggested these new reactions may account for the extra heat,
       as well as explaining why the ratio of helium isotopes  is different
       for geothermal gases  than  the ratio found in the galaxy.  Jupiter,
       which emits twice as much heat as  can  be  explained  presently, is
       another area where hydrons may be involved.

       Observations of volcanic  emissions  have also been  found  to  have
       large anounts of tritium, more than can be explained from the normal
       fusion rate at  the volcanoe's temperature.  Tritium-producing RDNRs
       may explain the excess, according to Mayer.

       The broad scope  of  the  theory   is  one  the  reasons  it  is  so
       attractive, said Mayer.  It is not just limited to  explaining  cold
       fusion phenomenon, but many other scientific puzzles.

       In fact, the strongest evidence for the new theory may come from
       other fusion experiments at Brookhaven National Laboratory.

       Scientists there are  studying  a  process  known  as Cluster Impact
       Fusion in which they shoot deuterium atoms at titanium foil. Charged
       particles measured during the experiment  appear to match one of the
       isotope reactions proposed by Mayer and Reitz.

       Another puzzle that may back-up the new theory is the diffusivity of
       hydrogen into metals.   This  is  a  well-recognized   problem  that
       embrittles the metals.

       The hydrons, in  addition to being neutral, would be extremely small
       and could seep into metals much more  effectively than similar atoms
       like oxygen or  nitrogen.   Since the hydrons are short-lived,  they
       would convert back ("go normal" in Mayer's words) taking up a larger
       volume.  And since  the  hydrons  are  now  inside  the  metal, this
       increase could cause  cracking,   a  possible  explanation  for  the
       metal's brittleness.

       Mayer's audience at  the  lecture  included  Peter   Hagelstein,   a
       theoretician at MIT  who  had  provided  one  of  the first possible
       explanations for cold fusion almost two years ago.

       While intrigued with  the  new  theory,   Hagelstein   was  not  yet
       persuaded that hydrons could exist. The mathematical  proof  of them
       would be difficult, he said.

       Mayer agreed but  pointed  out  one  of  the  benefits of the hydron
       explanation was a number of obvious experimental tests that could be
       done to either support or contradict  the theory.  Repeating some of
       the cold fusion   experiments,   with  deliberate   and   controlled
       contamination of the  metals, would be an excellent start, according
       to Mayer.

       Concluding his lecture, Mayer answered what he said was the most
       obvious question --  does  the  theory suggest a large scale nuclear
       energy source. While refusing to  speculate  on  the  actual method,
       Mayer simply responded, "I think there is."
