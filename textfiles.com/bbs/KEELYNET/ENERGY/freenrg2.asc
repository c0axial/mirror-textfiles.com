       What Is Energy In An Electric Circuit?

       Energy in an Electric Circuit:  Here's the principle loud and clear.

       Energy in an electric circuit involves only the potentialization and
       depotentialization of the electron carriers in that circuit.(21)  It
       involves only the  potential  gradient   (the  joules  per  coulomb)
       collected by the circuit to potentialize its electrons, and the

                                      Page 1





       number of coulombs  of  electrons  that are potentialized during the
       collection phase.

       Electric circuits simply utilize electrons as carriers of "potential
       gradients," from the source to the  load,  where these gradients and
       the activated electrons constitute excess trapped EM energy.  In the
       "shocking/scattering" occurring in    the    load,    the    jerking
       (acceleration) of the  electrons  causes  these  activated (trapped-
       energy-carrying) electrons to shuck off their potential gradients by
       emitting them as scattered photons (heat).

       If one is thoughtless enough to allow  the  primary potential source
       to remain in the circuit during the "work" phase, then  one is using
       the potentialized electrons  to also go back into the primary source
       and scatter energy from its internal  resistance  (in  ternal load),
       thereby disorganizing the organization that was producing the source
       potential and energy in the first place.

       If one does  that,  then  all  the  while one is getting  some  work
       (scattering of energy)  in  the  load,  one is also steadily getting
       some work done inside the primary  source  to  steadily  destroy it!
       Literally one is killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.

       Continued Operations:  But back to our circuit.  After  we  complete
       one full collection/discharge  cycle,  we wish to continue producing
       work in the external load.  So we  simply  switch the collector back
       away from the  load and onto the primary source, collect  some  more
       current-free potential, and again independently switch the collector
       with its repotentialized free electrons back across the load.

       We can repeat  this  two-cycle  process to potentialize the external
       load and power it as long as we wish, from a battery or other source
       of potential, and never take any  power  at  all  from  the  primary
       battery.  We do not need to drain the battery or source  at  all, in
       order to power  a  load,  unless  we  attempt  to power it directly.
       Powering the external load is always free!

       Nature has been most kind, and we  have been most ignorant.  You can
       have all the trapped electrical energy you wish, from  any source of
       potential, for free.  You can power all the external loads you wish,
       for free, by  using  a  collector  as a secondary source, and simply
       shuttling potential between the primary  source  and  the collector.
       (22) But you  cannot  have  power for free from (in)  the  potential
       source.  If you allow current flow in your collection cycle, you are
       depleting the separated   charges   inside   the  battery  that  are
       furnishing the source potential.

       The Coal-Fired Locomotive

       Rigorous Analogy of a Coal-Fired  Locomotive.   Now  here's an exact
       analogy, to assist  in  understanding.  Imagine a coal-fired  train,
       and a fireman  shoveling coal.  He has an external load/scatterer of
       energy (the fire in the firebox under the boiler).

       He has a  primary source of potential/energy  (the  coal  car).   No
       fireman in his right mind would ignite the coal in  the chute of the
       coal bin, to  try  and get some heat energy into the firebox!  [That
       is, he would not attempt to extract  power  from  the  source.   Yet
       that's exactly what all we engineers are trained to do at present.]

                                      Page 2





       Instead, the fireman   takes  out  (collects)  a  finite  amount  (a
       shovelful) of coal (trapped energy).   Coal  per  se  (the potential
       gradient) has a  certain  energy  density per unit  volume  (trapped
       joules per unit  volume  of  coal)  and the shovel (collector) has a
       certain volume.  Accordingly,  the  shovelful  of  coal  contains  a
       certain amount of trapped joules of energy.

       In the fireman's shovel (the collector), the energy remains in total
       ly trapped form,  as coal not afire and without its  trapped  energy
       being dissipated as  work.   [He  doesn't act like a fool and ignite
       the coal in the shovel either!]  He  then throws that shovel of coal
       (collected trapped energy)  onto  the  fire (scatterer),  completely
       separately from the  coal  bin/source.   He  continues to repeat his
       shoveling cycle, and  each shovelful  of  coal  added  to  the  fire
       dissipates additional energy, powering the load.

       The Free Energy Principle

       All potential gradient (trapped excess energy density)  is  free for
       the taking.(23)  The  potential  is  due to the violent VPF exchange
       between the vacuum and the separated  bipolar charges furnishing the
       source potential gradient.   The  energy of the entire  universe  is
       flowing through that source potential.  You can have as much of this
       internal VPF flux  energy  (potential)  as you wish, as often as you
       wish, so long as you don't demand  current  (which  is power, or the
       rate at which  the  energy  is  being freed and dissipated.).   It's
       really simple.  You  can  have all the trapped energy you wish, from
       any source.  You cannot connect to the source and start to dissipate
       the energy as power, however, without  starting  to close the "gate"
       from which your free trapped energy is coming.

       In other words, here's the iron rule:  If you draw current, you kill
       the bipolarity gate  furnishing  the potential gradient  (source  of
       energy density).  In  that case, you kill the source.  If you do not
       draw current, you do not kill the  bipolarity  gate  and  you do not
       shut down the source.  In that case, you can continue  to  "use"  it
       and extract trapped EM energy from it forever.

       Definitions Again

       Definitions:  I'll put  down some simple equations, that may help to
       explain it more exactly.  First we repeat some definitions.

       Energy is any ordering imposed upon  the  virtual  particle  flux of
       vacuum.  EM energy is any ordering imposed upon the  virtual  photon
       flux of vacuum.   Static energy is an ordering (a template) which is
       stationary with respect to the external observer.

       Dynamic energy is an ordering (a template)  which is stationary with
       respect to the external observer.

       Potential:  Any ordering imposed upon the virtual particle  flux  of
       vacuum.  Scalar potential  is  an  ordering  (template)  that is not
       moving with respect to the external  observer.   Vector potential is
       an ordering (template) that is moving with respect  to  the external
       observer.

       The scalar EM  potential is any static (with respect to the external
       observer) ordering imposed upon the  virtual  photon flux of vacuum.
       Etc.
                                      Page 3





       Note again that   energy   and   potential  have  exactly  the  same
       definition.  Potential is  in  fact   trapped   energy.   Scalar  EM
       potential is static EM energy (to the external observer)  or trapped
       (collected) EM energy.    In   other  words,  if  one  takes  off  a
       differential of potential onto a fixed number of coulombs, one takes
       off a certain magnitude of trapped  EM  energy.  In other words, one
       takes out a shovelful of coal from the coal car.

       Importance of Separation of Charges

       We Must Not  Dispel  the Separation of Charges In Our  Source:   The
       difference in our   coal-fired  train  analogy  and  our  electrical
       circuit is that, in the coal train,  the coal in the coal car is not
       automatically and continually replenished.  Also,  the  coal  in the
       coal car has  already been collected by the mass of the coal car, so
       it is not infinite.

       In the electrical circuit, the potential  gradient  in  the  primary
       source is continually replenished, automatically, and it is infinite
       (though it has a finite energy density).  The reason  is simple.  EM
       potential (in the  normal  sense)  is actually a virtual photon flux
       exchange between the  vacuum  (the   entire  vacuum,  all  over  the
       universe) and a   charged   particle   or  collection   of   charged
       particles.(24)

       Thus the potential  (gradient)  is a powerful energy flux, pumped by
       the vacuum and the entire universe, that continues automatically, so
       long as we  do not allow the collected  charges  in  our  bipolarity
       source to be dissipated.

       In terms of a battery, we achieved separation of charges  inside the
       battery by chemical  action,  and  we paid for that initially.  Once
       separated, the charges essentially  stay  separated  (because of the
       chemistry) unless we foolishly do something to dissipate  them, such
       as upsetting the chemistry, so they are no longer separated positive
       from negative.

       So if we don't do anything to these separated charges, they continue
       to be driven  by  their  fierce exchange of virtual photon flux with
       the vacuum/universe.  If we then  simply  extract  some of that flux
       exchange, without moving  the  charges,  we  are  directly  "gating"
       trapped EM energy from the vacuum/charged particle VPF exchange.(25)

       The Potential Is Infinite And So Is Its Energy Content

       You Can't Dip  The  Ocean  Dry With a Spoon:  Let's say that another
       way.  The charged  particles  in  our  potential  source  are  in  a
       constant, seething, equilibrium exchange of trapped  EM  energy with
       the entire universe.   That  energy exchange is so enormous that, if
       we gate some of it out to collect on some other "temporarily frozen"
       charges and potentialize/activate them, the vacuum flux doesn't even
       miss it.  It's like dipping a spoonful  of water out of the restless
       ocean.  The hole is instantly filled, and the water replenished.  We
       can dip with that spoon as much as we wish, and the ocean will never
       run dry, but will simply continue to furnish us water,  spoonful  by
       spoonful.

       The same is  true  in  our  electric  circuits.  We can have all the
       potential (trapped EM energy density) we wish, for free, from a

                                      Page 4





       single source, so long as we do not allow work to be done inside the
       source to close off our "gate" and kill our primary source.

       The Twisted Concept of Voltage

       Before We Develop  Some  Pseudo-Equations:  In the equations we wish
       to develop, we have one problem,  due  to  the  lack  of  insight of
       conventional electrical physicists.   That  is, they  have  insisted
       upon "measuring" and   expressing   both   the   infinite  potential
       (nondissipated) and a certain quantity  of potential (dissipated) in
       volts.

       So they say  "a potential of so many volts."  That's  nonsense,  and
       totally erroneous.  Rigorously, a voltage is a drop or a dissipation
       of so much  (a finite amount of) collect ed excess potential/energy.
       You "measure" the voltage in a voltmeter  by  impressing a potential
       gradient upon the electron gas in the circuitry, wherein you collect
       or get in your voltmeter so much [(joules/coulomb) x coulombs].

       A tiny current (coulombs/second) from this internal  collection then
       flows for a finite time through the resistance of the voltmeter.  So
       you dissipate (joules/coulomb)   x  (coulombs/second)  x  (seconds),
       which gives a certain amount of energy  dissipated as work in moving
       the needle of the voltmeter.

       The voltmeter is  calibrated  so that it effectively  indicates  the
       collected energy per  coulomb that was dissipated, and it calls that
       entity voltage.  It involves a finite  amount  of  energy  that  has
       already been dissipated  as work, and it's a measure  of  the  local
       energy density of  the  potential  in terms of joules/coulomb. It is
       not a measure of the potential proper.

       It's after the fact; the extracted (collected) potential gradient it
       actually refers to existed in the past, before the work (dissipation
       of the collected  trapped  energy)   was  done.   To  refer  to  the
       potential before its dissipation as "voltage" is precisely  the same
       as confusing the future with the past.  A "potential (difference) of
       so many volts"  is actually a statement that "a potential difference
       of so much energy per coulomb" could  be dissipated in a load, if it
       were connected to  the load so that a finite amount  of  energy  was
       collected, and this  finite load-collection was allowed to dissipate
       as power (volts/coulomb x coulomb/sec)  for  a finite time, yielding
       work.  It's even worse, but it would take a textbook  to  straighten
       out this one error in EM theory.

       So we'll leave  it  at that, and we'll adapt the notion of potential
       the way it is corrupted in electrical  circuit  theory.   There it's
       used not really as energy, but rather as excess energy  per  coulomb
       of potentialized charge.   I apologize for that difficulty, which is
       not of my own making, but I must use  the  conventional notion if we
       are to greatly clarify the pseudo equations.

       The Equations of Free Energy

       The Pseudo-Equations:  Let  us  use  the  following  subscripts  and
       letter convention, and develop the nomenclature needed:

         T = trapped   d = dissipated or dissipating


                                      Page 5





         m = translated (moving) K = energy

         V =  volts  =  potential  drop (potential dissipated) = previously
           collected potential radiated away as heat in a load, doing work
           on the load in the process.  Unfortunately we shall also have to
           speak of a potential gradient  that  is not being dissipated, so
           we shall  have to speak of "trapped volts" which  is  erroneous,
           but complies with the common usage.

         0 = electrostatic scalar potential.      Coul = coulombs

         i =  amperes  =  Dissipating  potentialized  coulombs  per  second
             flowing, so amps are something  translating, always.  Amps are
             excited coulombs,  per  second,  that  are  dissipating  their
             excitation.  With  superconductivity  excluded,  you only have
             amps when you have a potential drop across a load.  So we will
             speak of  amps as "dissipating,"  meaning  that  potentialized
             electrons are  traveling  through  a  load, dissipating  their
             activation (gradients)  in  the  load  by  radiating scattered
             photons (heat).

         n = number of electrons in a coulomb = 6.3 x 1018electrons/coulomb

       Here are the pseudo equations (superconductivity is excluded):

        ampm  =  could/sec  =  n electronsm/sec = n electronsd/sec   [1]

        delta0 = VT  (as conventionally referred to.  It would be    [2]
             volts if  all  of  it were  dissipated,  but  it  is  not  yet
             dissipated, so it is sort of "trapped volts".   Erroneous, but
             the common  use.  So we will speak (somewhat distastefully) of
             "trapped volts" and "dissipated volts."

        Vd x ampd x sec = watts x sec = power x time = work = Kd     [3]

        Vd x could/sec  x sec  =  (work)  = Kd                       [4]

       In the switching, we switch KT to Kd  so

       KT -> Kd                                                      [5]

       But VT x coulT  = KT                                          [6]

       Or VT = [KT]/[coulT] = trapped energy/trapped coulomb         [7]

       KT = [VT] x [coulT] = amount of trapped energy, each cycle    [8]

       So that's what we were getting at.  The amount of trapped energy you
       can transfer (in  other  words,   how  much  coal  you  get  in  one
       shovelful) depends upon the number of trapped electrons  you have in
       the trapped free  electron  gas  in the collector, and the potential
       gradient you apply to those trapped coulombs to potentialize them.

       Relaxation Time and Semiconductors

       Relaxation Time:  The time it takes  for  the  free  electrons  in a
       conductor (or material)  to  reach  the  skin  of   the  wire  after
       potential is applied, is of course called the relaxation time.


                                      Page 6





       During that time,  the  free  electrons  in  the  gas  are "trapped"
       insofar as producing  current  (dissipation  of  the  potential)  is
       concerned.  However, immediately  after  the relaxation  time  ends,
       current begins and dissipation of the trapped energy begins.

       In copper, the  relaxation time is incredibly rapid.  It's about 1.5
       x 10-19 sec.  However, in quartz it is about 10 days!  So as you can
       see, we need to get somewhere in between these two values, and so we
       will have to "mix" or "dope" materials.

       We must get a sufficiently long  relaxation  time  so  that  we  can
       switch and collect comfortably in cycle one, then switch  into cycle
       two for dispersion of the freely collected energy in the collector.

       However, the relaxation  time  we  get  must also be short enough to
       allow quick discharge in the load,  as soon as we switch the primary
       source away from  the  collector.   Actually  we need  a  degenerate
       semiconductor material instead of plain copper.

       Degenerate Semiconductor Material:    A  semiconductor  material  is
       intermediate between a good conductor  and  an  insulator.   It's  a
       nonlinear material, and doped.  A degenerate semiconductor  material
       is one which has all its conduction bands filled with electrons, and
       so it thinks it is a conductor.  That is, a degenerate semiconductor
       is essentially a doped conductor, so to speak.

       As you can   see,  we  can  increase  the  relaxation  time  in  our
       "conductors" connected to the source  by  making  them of degenerate
       semiconductor material.  What we're talking about  is  "doping"  the
       copper in the wire, and in the collector, so that we can have plenty
       of time to  collect,  and  switch,  and  discharge,  and switch, and
       collect, etc.

       Now in a doped conductor (degenerate  semiconductor),  we can tailor
       the relaxation time  by  tailoring  the doping.  We  must  dope  the
       copper before we  make  the wire.  Why would we wish to do that?  We
       want to overcome the single problem  that so far has defeated almost
       all the "overunity" researchers and inventors.

       WHEN YOU CONNECT  TO  A  SOURCE,  YOU CAN ONLY EXTRACT  CURRENT-FREE
       POTENTIAL __ FREE   "TRAPPED  EM  ENERGY"  __  DURING  THE  ELECTRON
       RELAXATION TIME in the connecting  conductors and succeeding circuit
       components.  AFTER THAT, YOU'RE STEADILY EXTRACTING  POWER,  AND THE
       ENERGY EXTRACTED FROM  THE  SOURCE  IS BEING PARTIALLY DISSIPATED IN
       THE RESISTANCE/LOADING OF THE CIRCUIT,  AND  PARTIALLY DISSIPATED IN
       THE INTERNAL RESISTANCE  OF THE SOURCE.  IN THE LATTER  DISSIPATION,
       YOU'RE ALSO DISSIPATING  YOUR  SOURCE BY DOING WORK ON IT INTERNALLY
       TO KILL IT.

       Good Copper Wire:  Bane  of  Overunity  Inventors:   Many  destitute
       inventors, tinkering and  fiddling with overunity  devices,  finally
       get something (a  circuit  or  device) that does yield more work out
       than they had to input.

       At that point they usually conclude  that  it's  simply the specific
       circuit configuration and its conventional functioning that produces
       the overunity work.  However, usually as soon as this  configuration
       is more carefully  built  with  very good materials, boom!  It isn't
       overunity anymore.

                                      Page 7





       The inventors and  their  assistants then desperately bang and clang
       away, getting more frustrated as the  years pass.  The investors get
       mad, sue for  fraud,  or  get  in  all  sorts  of  squabbles.    The
       scientists who tested  it  and found it wanting, pooh-pooh the whole
       thing as a scam and a fraud, or just  a seriously mistaken inventor.
       Scratch one more "overunity" device.

       Most of these  inventors got their successful effect  (and  possibly
       erratically) when they  were  struggling with inferior, usually old,
       usually corroded materials.   Actually,   the   more  inferior,  the
       better.  The more contaminated/doped, the better!

       The moment you wire up your circuit with good copper  wire connected
       between the battery or primary source and any kind of load including
       the distributed circuitry  loading  itself,  you  can  forget  about
       overunity.  You will lose it in the  copper,  after  the first 1.5 x
       10-19 second!

       Think of a  really good conductor such as copper as  an  essentially
       linear material.  Linear  means  energy conservative.  Overunity can
       only be done with a highly nonlinear  effect.   So your "conductors"
       have to be made of nonlinear materials.  In fact,  they  have  to be
       made of degenerate semiconductor material.

       For the type of circuitry we are talking about, the copper has to be
       doped and then  made  into  "doped copper" wiring.  You also have to
       utilize the primary  battery  only   to   potentialize  a  collector
       (secondary battery/source), and  then  use  this  secondary  battery
       source to conventionally power the load while also killing itself.

       The Wiring And  the  Collector  Must  Be of Degenerate Semiconductor
       (DSC) Material.(26)  A good materials  scientist/engineer,  together
       with a decent electrodynamicist, can readily design  and tailor some
       doped copper wiring  so  that  the  material  in  the  wiring  is  a
       degenerate semiconductor material,    with    a   target   (desired)
       relaxation time.  That's what you should use to make  the  wiring to
       connect up your  source  to  the  collector  with,  and that type of
       material is also what you use in your collector.

       You can use either a coil or a capacitor  as  the collector, but its
       "conductive" material has to be degenerate semiconductor material __
       in short, it must be doped to have the proper relaxation time.  From
       the collector to the load, however, obviously you want to use a good
       conductor material.  Ordinary copper will do nicely there.

       Once you do that, you're in business.  When making the DSC material,
       simply tailor the  relaxation  time  to  something which  is  easily
       switched.  For example,  take  one millisec.  With a relaxation time
       of that long, switching is easy.   In  fact, one could even use good
       mechanical switching.  Or  easily  use  inexpensive  ordinary  solid
       state switching, without  having  to  go  all  the way to nanosecond
       switching.

       Then in the collector you calculate the number of "trapped coulombs"
       you have.  Take  the  "trapped  voltage"  (current-free  potential's
       energy density per coulomb) you extract from the source  during  the
       electron relaxation time after the collector is connected.  Multiply
       the number of  trapped  coulombs  in  the  collector  by the trapped
       voltage during collection, and you have the amount of energy in

                                      Page 8





       joules that you  extract  FOR  FREE, without paying for it, from the
       source during every collection cycle.

       Sources, Collectors, and Power

       Tapping Vacuum Energy.  You're getting  the excess electrical energy
       directly from the  vacuum,  as we briefly pointed  out  above.   The
       vacuum will freely  replenish  all the "trapped voltage" you extract
       from the primary source during the  electron  relaxation  time.   It
       won't replenish a  single  bit of "dissipated voltage"  (power)  you
       extract from the source.

       Note that the  same considerations apply in the collector.  It's got
       to have a somewhat longer electron  relaxation  time.  Its electrons
       stay "unrelaxed" during  the collection cycle, and  allow  for  some
       additional switching time to connect to the load.

       The "trapped voltage"  across the collector multiplied by the number
       of trapped coulombs in it, gives  the  number  of  joules of FREE EM
       ENERGY you extract and get into and onto the collector (the shovel).
       In other words, that's your "shovelful of coal."

       You then throw  the  "shovelful" onto the fire/load  __  you  simply
       disconnect the collector  from  the  primary  source  and connect it
       across the external  load.  The collector  (secondary  battery)  now
       powers the load  and its own internal resistance,  "killing"  itself
       while furnishing the energy for powering the external load as well.

       The Source Can Be Almost Anything:  You can use as a source a simple
       elevated wire, to  "tap"  potential  from  the  200-300  volts/meter
       between earth and  ionosphere.  Here  again,  you  need  to  utilize
       calibrated, doped wire.

       Finally, you must adjust the repetition switching in accordance with
       the discharge time  through the load.  In other words,  you  have  a
       serial process as follows:

          (1)  extract  trapped energy (potential) from the source onto the
               collector, delta t1.
          (2)  Switch the collector off the  source,  onto the load, during
               time delta t2.
          (3)  Wait while the collected energy in the collector  discharges
               through the load, during time delta t3.
          (4)  Switch  the  collector  back  off  the  load  and  onto  the
               potential source, during time  delta t4.  That completes one
               cycle.
       The serial timing simply is

                   [delta t1 + delta t2 + delta t3 + delta t4].

       If you balance  all  the  doping  and  the  materials   design,  and
       correlate the switching, you can get all the free energy you wish.
       Properly utilized, a  single  car  battery  can  be used to power an
       electric automobile indefinitely.  Or even to power a battleship.


       In the real world, of course, you will inevitably have a tiny bit of
       loss as you go, because there's a  finite  (though  high) resistance
       between the two poles of your battery.  Handling that is a piece of

                                      Page 9





       cake.  Simply run  a separate little collection circuit to collect a
       little bit of trapped EM energy from  the slowly leaking source, and
       ever so often  feed the collected energy back into  the  battery  as
       power, to "reseparate"  the charges (charge the battery) and replace
       the small amount of the primary source's potential gradient that has
       been lost.  The battery, load, and  "trickle  charger" then become a
       closed-circuit free-energy source  that  will  last  for  years  and
       years.

       Limited Only By  One's  Imagination:   Of  course  you  can see many
       variants; this is just the "master  key."   You  can  have  multiple
       collectors, collecting trapped energy simultaneously  or in sequence
       off a single  source,  and  pooling  their  collected energy to more
       powerfully power the load.

       You can utilize  a  very  high  "voltage",  such  as  in  the  Swiss
       electrostatic overunity device, to increase the energy collected per
       coulomb in each  switching  (in  each  shovelful)   in  accord  with
       equation [8].

       For a battery  , you can set a separate little collector/load device
       to trickle-charge the battery, overcoming  the small normal "leakage
       current" that does  occur  in  batteries  and in real  circuits  and
       devices.  The opportunities  are  endless.  You can put in a unit to
       take mostly only power-free energy  from  the  "power  line" feeding
       your business or home, reducing your utility bill by __ say __ 90%.

       Or you can simply build a small home power unit to do the whole job,
       for only a few hundred dollars.  This simple secret  can  be used to
       power the world, cheaply and cleanly, and to clean up the biosphere.

       Conclusion

       Well, there you  have  it.   I've  given  you  the  benefit  of what
       required most of  my  adult  life   to  discover.   The  definitions
       advanced in this  paper are rigorous.  It took years  of  sweat  and
       tears to come  up  with  them.  They're simple, but they will change
       your entire understanding  of electromagnetics,  power,  and  energy
       once you grasp  them.   Please read them, and ponder  them,  several
       times.  One or  two  readings  will not be sufficient to fully grasp
       what is said here.

       Also, hopefully by this time the reader  is  beginning to experience
       the same emotions  as  I experienced when I finally  discovered  how
       simple it all  really  was.   First one wants to laugh for about two
       hours at how truly ignorant we've  all  been.  Then one wants to cry
       for about two hours for the same reason.  This could  all  have been
       done a century    ago,    if   we   had   ever   really   understood
       electromagnetics.

       We've had this  electromagnetics   around  for  over  100  years  __
       Maxwell's book was  published  in 1873.  We got it  wrong,  starting
       right with Maxwell  and  his  use  of  the material ether, which was
       almost universally assumed at the time.

       Still, by using quaternions, Maxwell  succeeded  in  packing a great
       deal more in  the model than even he himself recognized.   When  the
       vector aspects interacted  to form a zero resultant translationally,
       those active interactants were still in there and still fighting and

                                      Page 10





       interacting.  The scalar  component  of the quaternion remained, and
       infolded those struggling  vectors  and  functions  of  them  inside
       itself.

       In short, it  captured  the case where the electromagnetic  energies
       are involved in   translation   actions  which  nullify  each  other
       translationally (electromagnetically).   However,  the  energies are
       still in there in the continuing interactants inside the zero vector
       resultant.  As such, they are trapped EM energy.

       And it is the trapped EM energy inside a mass __ not the mass per se
       __ which is responsible for gravitation.  In other  words, Maxwell's
       theory already correctly    captured    the   unification   of   the
       gravitational field and the electromagnetic field in 1873.

       Then Heaviside et  al  forced  Maxwell's   theory   into   a  vector
       framework, throwing out  the  scalar component, and  discarding  the
       unification of gravitation and electromagnetics along with it.

       Serious errors were  made and still exist in many of the fundamental
       definitions; in fact, many of them aren't definitions at all.

       Nearly every engineer and physicist can readily calculate potentials
       __ all, of course, on the "dissipation"  side  where  the potentials
       are actually the  amount  of  potential  that was collected  upon  a
       collector and then   dissipated.   I  could  find  hardly  a  single
       physicist who really knew what a  scalar  potential  was  prior to a
       finite amount being collected and dissipated as voltage.  Yet 99% of
       them firmly believed they understood the potential.

       So now you have the results of this researcher's  long  and  arduous
       quest for the  golden  fleece.   Please  go forward with it, to make
       this a better and cleaner world for everyone.

       Just remember that the control and  use of energy is personal power.
       The control and  use of absolute energy is the control  and  use  of
       absolute personal power.   In  the  old  adage,  power  corrupts and
       absolute power corrupts absolutely.

       Please use it wisely.

            333-355.  Since the scalar potential actually  consists totally
            of a set of hidden bidirectional EM waves, then scalar
            interferometry is  possible,  and  not  just  an oxymoron as it
            would seem without considering  the inner wave structure of the
            scalar potential.  Two scalar potentials (each  of  which  is a
            multi-biwave set)  can  interfere; it is just a special kind of
            multiple wave  interferometry   between   their  internal  wave
            compositions.  This  is  a  major point of profound  impact  on
            physics.  Whittaker  in fact showed that all classical EM could
            be replaced by such scalar EM potential interferometry.

            field due  to  electrons  by  means  of  two  scalar  potential

            Further, scalar interferometry  has  been  proven;  today it is
            called the Aharonov-Bohm Effect.  See Y. Aharonov  and D. Bohm,
            "Significance of  Electromagnetic  Potentials  in  the  Quantum
            Theory," Physical Review, Second  Series, 115(3), Aug. 1, 1959,

            effects of  electromagnetic fluxes," Reviews of Modern Physics,
            57(2), April  1985.   Modern  scientists  have  generally  been
            unaware of   the  inner  wave  structure  of  the   interfering
            potentials and have utilized only quantum mechanical theory for
            the interference.    Consequently,   they  have  been  able  to
            experimentally establish the  AB effect for only a few thousand
            angstroms distance.   With  the Whittaker formulation,  the  AB
            effect becomes   distant-independent,   because  the  necessary
            potentials can be fabricated  as  laser-like  beams,  simply by
            assembling the proper Whittaker multibeam set.

            Also, Ignatovich  pointed  out that the Schroedinger  potential
            can also be decomposed into just such an internal bidirectional
            EM wave   set.    See   V.   K.   Ignatovich,  "The  remarkable

         5. Both  wave  and antiwave co-exist in the vacuum simultaneously,
            forming a stress wave.  The entity that is stressed is the rate
            of flow of time.  In the common  interaction  with  matter, the
            time-forward half  of the stress wave normally  interacts  with
            the electron  shells  of the atom, giving electron translations
            forces.  The time-reversed or anti-wave half interacts with the
            nucleus, giving the Newtonian 3rd law reaction (recoil) forces.
            The so-called "EM wave" in vacuum is a gravitational wave.  It
            is a wave of oscillation of  the  rate  of flow of time.  It is
            rather like a sound wave in air, as Tesla pointed  out,  and it
            is a longitudinal wave, not a transverse "string" wave.

         6. As pointed out by Nikola Tesla.  Tesla was correct, and all the
            textbooks with  their  transverse  "string" waves are in error.
            There are no strings in the vacuum!

         9. Sommerfield's  theory  of  metallic  conduction  was  based  on
            Drude's concept   that   the   outer  valence  electrons  of  a
            conductor, which do not form crystal bonds, are free to migrate
            through the crystalline lattice  structure,  and  so to form an
            electron gas.   At  room  temperature,  by  quantum  mechanical
            considerations these free electrons are moving randomly, but at
            an average  velocity on the order of 106 meters per sec.  E.g.,
            see Martin A. Plonus, Applied  Electromagnetics,  McGraw  Hill,
            New York,  1978, p. 54-58, 62-3, 376-7.  If you  wish  to  know
            just how  much  power exchange is driving the collisions of the
            electron gas in a copper wire, here is an illustration.  In one
            cubic centimeter of copper wire,  the power exchange in and out
            of the  electron gas is some 4 billion billion  watts.   That's
            the equivalent  of  4 billion large electric power plants, each
            of 1,000 megawatt capacity.  And one cubic centimeter of copper
            is a lump about the size of the end of your little finger.

            Feynman Lectures on Physics,  Addison-Wesley, New York, Vol. 1,
            1963, p. 2-4.  In the classical EM theory launched  by  Maxwell
            and later modified by Heaviside et al, this problem did not
            exist for   the  original  theoretical  formulation.   In  that
            formulation by Maxwell, and continued  by Heaviside, a material
            ether   is   assumed   for  the  model.   The  Michelson-Morley
            experiments of 1887 destroyed the notion of the material ether,
            but the   classical   electromagnetics  model  has  never  been
            corrected to rectify its very  serious foundations flaw in this
            respect.

            Physics, Dover  Publications, New York, 1963, p. 283-287.  Note
            on p.  283 that a "field of  force"  at  any  point is actually
            defined only for the case when a unit mass is  present  at that
            point.  In  spite  of  this,  most classical electrodynamicists
            continue to adhere to the notion  that  the  EM field exists as
            such in  the  vacuum,  but do admit that physically  measurable
            quantities such  as force somehow involve the product of charge
            and field.

            E.g., see J.D. Jackson, Classical  Electrodynamics,  2nd  Edn.,
            John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1975, p. 249.  Note  that  holding
            such a  concept  is  tantamount  to  holding on to the material
            ether, and assuming that the  vacuum  itself is "measurable" or
            "observable."

        13. The formula F = ma is simply an algorithm for  calculating  the
            magnitude of  the  force.  It states that "the magnitude of the
            force is equal to the magnitude  of  mass that is accelerating,
            multiplied by the magnitude of the acceleration."   No  such  "
            equals" formula  is  a  definition;  it is only a calculational
            algorithm.

        14. This falsifies one of the assumptions  in  the common notion of
            the scalar potential; that its gradient in vacuum  is  a  force
            field.  Let us falsify another part of the conventional concept
            of the  potential.   Take  the  notion of forcibly pushing in "
            against the field" of a trapped  charge,  a  unit  charge  from
            infinity.  At any point you stop, the work n you  have  done on
            the unit  charge  is equal to the value of the potential, so it
            is said.  Actually, you pushed  in a one-coulomb collector, and
            have collected  and dissipated as work n joules  of  energy  on
            that one  coulomb.   In  other words, the energy density of the
            potential there, if collected and dissipated on a collector, is
            n, where n is joules per coulomb  (NOT  joules!).  To prove it:
            Suppose we go out on 10,000 radials from that  point,  and push
            in from  infinity  10,000 unit charges from infinity.  Then the
            total work done "against the  potential  gradient  ("field," in
            common language) is now 10,000 n.  This makes  no  sense at all
            from the  conventional  view  (which  carefully  refrains  from
            multiple collectors!).  It makes  good  sense  from our view of
            the potential  as having infinite energy but  a  finite  energy
            density.  In  that  case,  the more collectors, the more energy
            collected, for dispersal as work.

        17. The power in the load is always the time rate of dissipation of
            energy that  has  just  been  freely  collected by the load for
            dissipation.

        18. One can foresee a day in the  not  too  distant future when any
            power company continuing to do such an unthinkable  thing  will
            have a class action suit brought against it by its customers!

        20. Precisely analogous to a heat pump's operation  -  which  as is
            well-known can  readily be "over unity" in its efficiency.  The
            maximum efficiency of the heat pump is about 8.22.

            E.g., see David Halliday and  Robert  Resnick,  Fundamentals of
            Physics, 3rd Edition Extended, John Wiley and  Sons,  New York,
            1988, Volume  1,  p.   510-519.   Good heat pumps normally have
            about 4.0 efficiency.

        21. External power in an electric circuit refers to the dissipation
            rate (in  the  circuit's  external   load)   of  the  potential
            gradients on  the activated/potentialized electrons.   Internal
            power refers   to   the   dissipation  rate  in  the  circuit's
            bipolarity source.

        22. We call strong attention to  T.W.  Barrett,  "Tesla's Nonlinear
            Oscillator-Shuttle-Circuit (OSC)   Theory,"   Annales   de   la
            Fondation Louis  de  Broglie, 16(1), No. 1, 1991, p. 23-41.  In
            this important paper, Barrett  shows that a higher topology EM,
            such as  quaternion EM, allows many things to  be  accomplished
            with circuitry  that  are not apparent to a conventional vector
            or tensor  analysis of that  circuitry.   He  also  shows  that
            Nikola Tesla's  circuits  accomplished this higher  topological
            functioning.

        23. It  is easy to test this.  Connect several different wires to a
            single source of potential gradient.   With  respect to ground,
            the end  of  each  one  of those wires has the  same  potential
            gradient as does the original source with respect to ground.
            If you  connect  10  wires  to  a  single  "100-volt" potential
            gradient source, you will have ten 100-volt potential gradients
            appear.  You can use each of these ten potential gradients as a
            primary source.  From each of  these  new  primary sources, you
            can branch ten more, and now have a hundred potential  gradient
            sources.  You  can  treat each of these hundred new sources now
            as a primary source.  To each  one,  you  can  add  a switcher,
            collector, and  external  load, and drive all  100  loads.   Or
            instead, you   can  put  ten  switcher/collector/external  load
            circuits with  each of the hundred  new  primary  sources,  and
            power all 1,000 external loads.  Energy/potential  is free from
            any source,  so  long  as you do not demand power from the same
            source.

        25. We are easily permitted to have  free  energy  and  violate the
            "local energy conservation law for a closed system."   This  is
            because the  two-cycle  system is not closed, and so instead we
            must apply local energy conservation for an open system with a
            hidden source.  In any given  time  interval,  the energy taken
            (scattered) from the system as external work cannot  exceed the
            sum of  the  unscattered  trapped energy that was in the system
            initially and  the unscattered  energy  that  flowed  into  the
            system during that time interval.

        26. You  can  actually  do  away with the separate  collector,  and
            utilize the  doped copper DSC material itself as the collector.
            However, you will not be able  to collect nearly so much energy
            in each collection cycle, for dissipating in the load in the
            subsequent work cycle.
