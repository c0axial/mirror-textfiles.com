       ADDITIONAL COMMENT FROM BEARDEN (pertaining to the release of his
       paper "The Final Secret for Free Energy", listed on KeelyNet as
       FREENRG3.ZIP) :

       The  present  classical  CEM  model  prescribes  closed,  energy-
       conservative type systems. If any electrical device works totally
       according to the accepted CEM model, it cannot and will not ever
       produce overunity. Simply put, you have excluded any hidden EM
       source that is freely replenished, and you have assumed continual
       killing of all energy input sources utilized. On the other hand, if
       one takes the view that the overunity electrical machines are
       possible after all, then __ whether one is consciously aware of it
       or not __ one has implied that classical CEM must somehow be
       substantially flawed. If it's flawed, then __ being a model __ some
       of  its  primary  assumptions  (postulates)  and/or  fundamental
       definitions must be in error.

       The  proper  place  to  go  after  "free  electrical  energy"  is to
       rigorously examine CEM, over and over, until flaws are uncovered
       which allow a hidden, freely replenished source of input energy. In
       other words, one must find a way to "open" the electrical system to
       an in flow of energy from this source, without closing off the
       source.

       Until one finds such an "extension" of CEM, one has no model or
       concept  which  can  reasonably  be  expected  to  provide overunity
       electrical energy output. Note also that, while the majority of the
       EM circuitry of an electrical overunity machine may obey CEM, at
       least one section __ where the source is freely tapped and the
       excess energy extracted __ must violate CEM.

       I have spent many arduous years in this very process, right or
       wrong. The bottom line of my search is this: the only verified (by
       Whittaker and Ziolkowski) (WZ) "freely replenished river" of EM
       energy, that can act as the required "free energy" source for input
       to the would-be overunity electrical system, is the potential. But
       to understand the potential, completely new definitions are required
       for many entities, among them being energy, electrical charge,
       electrostatic scalar potential, voltage, etc. The present so-called
       "definitions" of these entities in CEM are either non-existent,
       entirely wrong, or quite unsatisfactory.


                                      Page 1





       So  far,  the  search  has  uncovered  two  major  ways  to  tap the
       continually-replenished EM energy in the scalar EM potential:

        (1) use of the inner WZ internal biwave structure of the potential
            as pump waves on/to a nonlinear material (such as the atomic
            nucleus), so that the nucleus becomes a pumped phase conjugate
            mirror. Then, by normal phase conjugate optical theory, simply
            inputting a small signal wave will produce an amplified phase
            conjugate replica (PCR) wave emitted from the mirror material,
            and this PCR will precisely backtrack the original input signal
            wave's path (see the distortion correction theorem) back out of
            the nucleus, out of the atom, and into the external circuit.

            There, the amplified PCR wave can be "filtered off" and sent to
            the external load, to power the load. The Floyd Sweet vacuum
            triode works precisely by this mechanism. Note particularly
            that Barrett has shown that higher topology EM (such as the
            original quaternion EM theory) can accomplish such "optical
            functioning" without the use of optical materials.

            To do Sweet's vacuum triode type process is thus theoretically
            possible with electrical circuitry alone, but one must have
            more than the current understanding of CEM, as Barrett pointed
            out. In other words, one can "open" any 4-space system by
            adding hyperspace (or subspace, if one insists on retaining
            Minkowski 4-space). One can thus have a hyperspatial source.
            Indeed, Ziolkowski and others have already pointed out that the
            WZ type decomposition of the scalar potential is essentially
            equivalent to having complex sources.

        (2) The second way is to "trap the electron gas electrons" in a
            separate  collector,  feed  "current-free  potential"  to  the
            collector from a primary battery or other source of potential,
            and  collect  a  bunch  of  excess  energy  (potential)  in the
            collector's "penned up free electron 'horses'" waiting to carry
            the excess energy to the load and dissipate it there, once they
            have been released.

            Then, one switches the primary potential source away from the
            collector, while the "energy-loaded horses" are still trapped
            and straining at the bit, so that no work can be done __ by
            those agitated horses when they stampede out of there __ on the
            internal resistance of the primary source, to destroy or reduce
            it.

            In the same switching action, the collector with its "snorting
            but still trapped electron horses" is switched across the load
            to form a totally separate circuit with it, having nothing at
            all to do with the original primary source of potential.  Then,
            the agitated horses are released, and thunder out through the
            load, scattering their riders (excess energy) in all directions
            in the load, producing work/heat and powering the load. They
            will  also  charge  on  around  to  the  reverse  side  of  the
            collector, and kill its charge separation (kill its potential)
            as well, just as does any ordinary circuit.

            The major disadvantage of method 1, as we presently have seen
            it done (however, check Barrett's demonstration that Tesla's
            patented circuitry is capable of doing it by circuitry alone),

                                      Page 2





            is that time-reversed electrical energy is produced. So Method
            1 has some serious drawbacks. "Time-reversed energy stuff",
            which should stay in the atomic nucleus as Newtonian 3rd law
            reactions and 3rd-law energy exchanges, is dragged out.

            Unusual effects on biological systems can occur. Antigravity
            effects can occur. Other hidden processes in the universes,
            that affect the atomic nucleus, can be gated into the external
            circuitry, causing disaster. Monopoles can be deposited in the
            magnets, causing them to explode like hand grenades. Most of
            the new "massive time-reverse energy" phenomenology is still
            unknown.

            One cannot at this stage of ignorance adequately guarantee
            human safety. I presently don't see just how this kind of
            energy  can  pass  an  Underwriter  Laboratories'  testing  and
            certification, until a lot more exhaustive work is done to
            understand the new phenomenology.

       Method 2, however, yields ordinary, garden-variety, positive-time
       electrical energy. The method presented in the paper is my own
       discovery. No unusual time-reversed phenomena are involved. It would
       appear to be eminently practical to produce and certify power units
       based on Method 2. The phenomenology and risks are the same as for
       ordinary, time-forward power systems.

       Method 2 has another unique characteristic: as a system, all the
       subsystems are already in the literature and validated. They have
       just  not  previously  been  put  together  in  this  fashion. So
       development of the system really represents an "integration" problem
       only,  after  one  first  does  a  little  development  of  a proper
       degenerate semiconductor material (DSM).

       In other words, one first develops (and tests) the exact doping
       materials and percentage, to get a DSM material that is still a good
       conductor but has a relaxation time of __ say __ one tenth of a
       millisecond. One builds the wires from the battery to the collector
       out of this new DSM material. If one uses a capacitor for the
       collector, the plates must be made out of the new DSM material, not
       out of normal "pure conductor" material.

       Then one develops a switcher that switches in one tenth (or less)
       the relaxation time of the DSM, or in this case in one hundredth of
       a millisecond. That switching time, of course, is easy for any
       decent electronic technician or electronic engineer.

       One also develops a timing circuit that will

           (1) sense the status of the discharge of the collector energy
               through the load, and
           (2) trigger the switching at the correct times so that a smooth
               two-cycle (collect, discharge) process results. Note that
               the lengths of cycle one and cycle two are not necessarily
               equal  at  all.  One  may  use  multiple  collectors/loads
               simultaneously, cascaded collectors/loads, etc. Hundreds of
               variations are possible and feasible.

       It is not possible to do anything with this discovery in a normal
       manner. I would dearly like to be economically independent, so I

       could work full time in my efforts on free energy, antigravity,
       extended EM healing, cancer, etc. Many orthodox scientists will also
       fiercely  resist  this  upstart  notion  of  "overunity"  electrical
       machines to the bitter end. When powerful economic interests realize
       one has such things for real, one is certainly going to be stopped,
       jailed, or killed, or he may just "mysteriously vanish" and never be
       seen again.

       So I just freely released and distributed my discovery of method 2,
       in the paper "The Final Secret of Free Energy". It is deliberately
       targeted toward technicians, junior engineers, and educated laymen.
       (The principles and definitions raised, however, can be debated to
       the nth degree by knowledgeable foundation scientists). The paper
       has already been distributed worldwide. Now the principles and
       definitions are available to everyone. If they are in error, shortly
       that will be proven in spades.  If they are correct, that will also
       be established shortly.

       Anyone who wishes can develop and patent a particular application.
       There's no longer any way to stop this information from being
       disseminated and utilized. I hope that a flurry of development and
       patenting activity will result around the world. Get cheap, clean
       electrical energy to everyone. Bring on the electric auto, clean up
       the noxious auto exhausts, get rid of giant oil spills, and clean up
       the biosphere.
