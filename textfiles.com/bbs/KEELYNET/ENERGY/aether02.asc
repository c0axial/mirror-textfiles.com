The following file is from an InterNet USENET response in the alt.sci.physics.
new-theories section.  It provides an interesting exchange on the properties
of the aether as being a solid mass yet laced with interstices where rhombic
dodecahedrons, tetrahedrons and other geometries connect.

Gene, although at one time I did think that a particle model would work
for the ether, I now agree with you that a continuous solid ether is the
preferred model.  My "If the ether was particles" was only to show that
this would clearly have kinematic properties.

Rhombic Dodecahedrons can pack space and are the nearest to spheres.
For this reason I believe that standing waves which are nearly
spherical can pack in that way also.  Buckminster Fuller worked
with tetrahedrons but his writing is very difficult to understand.

Temperature is simply a measurement of the variance of particle
velocities in a small region.  Except for em waves (see below).

The CMBR is electromagnetic waves mainly in the 1mm to 1cm range.
The power in the spectrum has now been accurately determined over a
wide range (it was previously limited by the earth's atmosphere).
I don't know how the detectors work.

The motion of the source is not the significant factor.  The wavelength
in our moving frame of reference is.  According to the measurements of
the imbalance in frequencies of the CMBR in different directions, we are
doing 370 km/s relative to it.  The temperature of the CMBR is really
a measure of the average wavelength, but also defines the wavelength
distribution as it is a blackbody radiation.  It is low (<3K) because
it is the distribution that would result if the radiation was in thermal
equilibrium with matter at the same temperature.

Yes, at the speed of light.  It is standard EM waves.
It cannot exhibit interference patterns because it is not coherent and
has a uniform distribution of frequencies.

I think that this argument is true of many QM experiments, but not of
the CMBR measurements.  I would certainly like to see the raw data of
the Bell's inequality measurements to test David Elm's theory.
