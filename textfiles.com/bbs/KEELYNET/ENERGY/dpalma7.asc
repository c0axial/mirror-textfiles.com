                      An Introduction to Free Energy Physics

                                 by Bruce DePalma

       It should be appreciated here that the ideas which are presented are
       coming from the  mind  of  one  man.   The  mind  of this one man is
       permeated by the  sea of space,  which  is  the  repository  of  all
       knowledge.  What we  see  is  what we get is the substance  of  this
       essay.

       Space, i.e. the  vacuum,  is filled with a sea of particles.  I call
       them Psions.  The Psion flux is responsible for the Brownian motions
       and "zero point  energy" fluctuations.   The  isotropic  Psion  flux
       moves at the speed of light.  The Psions interact with  matter  only
       slightly -- enough to cause Brownian motions and heat transfer.

       The Psion as  an  elemental  particle  principle  is not perfect, it
       contains the defect of weight or mass  which makes momentum transfer
       possible.  Its principle  property is memory.  That  is,  the  Psion
       remembers the material space it has just passed through, and retains
       the impression for  a given (quantized) relaxation time depending on
       the strength of the impression.

       Everyone is under   the   impression    that    antennas   "radiate"
       electromagnetic energy.

       Consider the condition  where  the  electrical  excitation   in  the
       conductors of the  antenna is transported (at the speed of light, C)
       to the observer by the Psion flux.

       The energy absorbed by the hysteresis  of  space, (as Tesla observed
       it), or the imperfection of the Psion interaction.

       The Psion hypothesis offers two great advantages.  The first is free
       energy, and the second is the result of the wish of the desirer, the
       formulator of the experiment.

       The first hypothesis of free energy is:

                   Energy is only created or destroyed, and
                   is not converted from one form to another.

       If all the  energy  liberating  processes  of the material world are
       considered as drawing their energy  from  the  free  energy field of
       space, then the amount of work we expend in liberating  this  energy
       becomes a result of the perfection of our ideas in the resolution of
       an experiment, (i.e. the production of energy).

       The electrical generator does not convert the mechanical input
       to an electrical result.

       The gasoline engine  does  not convert the latent heat of combustion
       of the fuel to visible work energy.  The fuel which is burned is the
       result of the  imperfection  of the  process  for  the  recovery  of
       (energy in this manner) from space.

       A perfect electrical  generator would reflect understanding  of  the
       material universe to  the  extent  that an energy liberation process
       could be materialized (i.e. constructed  in  material  form),  which
       would not consume itself or alter as the result of  the energy which
       was being liberated (from the free energy substrate).

       The proof of   this  idea  resides  in  the  N  machine/Space  Power
       Generators being simultaneously developed  in  the U.S.A. and Indian
       Nuclear Power Board Laboratories in Karwar, India.

       The Psion is so named because it coincides with the intelligent part
       of reality we call the mind.  The mind is a result  of it, and it is
       the result of  the mind.  Descriptive reality can take us no further
       than this.

       The experimenter is  the result of  the  experiment,  is  the  final
       result.  Thus the wish or the desire of the experimenter  is  turned
       into the result of his experiment.

       A man detects particles or waves depending under which hypothesis he
       is operating.

       The impression of  the  light  is brought to the experimenter by the
       Psion flux, the result of his experiment is what he wants to detect.
       If he wants particles he uses a photon  detector,  if he wants waves
       he uses a  diffraction  grating.   This  explains all  particle  and
       nuclear physics.

       Man's role as  creator  can only be elaborated through resolution of
       discipline and related forms.  The  result of the experiment is what
       man wanted so  he must perfect his own principles  and  resolve  his
       thought -- which is what we make into reality, Man and his machines.

       I want to   add   a   thought   about   quantization.    States  are
       distinguished one from  another   by   what   I   call   the   least
       distinguishable thought.  This is reflected in the  decibel scale of
       hearing, and the musical scales of notes.

       After interaction with  a  material  object  the  Psion  retains  an
       impression which has a certain relaxation time.  In general, the

                                      Page 2





       relaxation time must   be   long   enough   to  satisfy  terrestrial
       measurements of the inverse square law; but for intergalactic
       distances the quantum    measurement    effect    of    the    least
       distinguishable measurement would take place so that  at  a  certain
       distance, light would just fade out.

       Thought and time  will  give  many  other  attributes  to  the Psion
       hypothesis.  Has man reached his  limit  or  not.  Every theory is a
       crutch to further-out places.

       A possible thought: A free energy society could create  anything  it
       wanted.  There might be some point in the history of the future when
       man might just forget himself -- and start over again.
