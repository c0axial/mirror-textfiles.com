  "Experiments with a Reich Orgone Accumulator as a Power Generation Device"

  Dedicated to the memory of Dr. Wilhelm Reich

  I reconstructed the experiment XX (originally performed by Wilhelm Reich),
  as best I could. The Accumulator was constructed of triangle cut sheets of
  galvanized iron, 3/16" mahogany plank, lead, wax paper, aluminum and
  radio-ctive source.

  The tetrahedron accumulator was 23" x 23" x 23" exterior dimension standard
  galvanized iron layered 3/16" mahogany for a total of 12 layers of each.
  The next three layers consisted of aluminum, wax paper then lead, the
  inside lead chamber was 4" x 4" x 4".  My experiment mirrored his as best I
  could.  Substitutions had to be made, but I was finally ready to test the
  experiment.  With a brand new geiger-counter and a video recorder we
  (myself and an assistant) were off!

        ---------------------------------------------------------------
         A full account of Reich's Experiment XX is found in Chapter II
            of "The Cancer Biopathy", c.1973. The chapter is titled:

   "Orgone Energy Vesicles (Bions) and the Natural Organization of Protozoa"

       The only thing this dissertation and the experiment have in common
     is that an ORAC (ORgone energy ACcumulator) was used in both.  Reich's
                was a 3 fold (layer) Orac, 1 cubic foot in size.
        ---------------------------------------------------------------

  Upon reaching the selected site, we set up camp and assembled the
  experiment.  Almost  immediately  we  began  to  have  problems  with the
  equipment!  The geiger-counter (which was new) wouldn't work and the video
  recorder was unable to record when we were near the experiment.

  Our portable power generator ran as if the timing was off.  All the
  equipment had been tested prior to our departure and was in perfect working
  order with the exception of the geiger counter (which was new) and I only
  had the nickel sixty-three isotope which I intended to use as a source, but
  no calibration source was available for testing the geiger counter,
  however, it was brand new, and I felt sure it was OK.

  It did register back ground radiation at the lab.  However, radioactive
  detection was negligible from our nickel sixty-three/kn 22 gas filled tube.

  At first I thought it was just coincidence or bad luck.  But when we left
  camp the video recorder began working fine and the generator began to run
  smoothly once again.

  The geiger-counter however, still would not work so I figured it was broken
  and ordered a replacement.  Meanwhile, I borrowed another geiger counter
  from a school and brought it out to the field.  This one also stopped
  working.  So I went once again to a school and again borrowed yet another
  geiger-counter.  This time I kept it on and monitored the readings from

                                     Page 1





  Canton High School to our camp a distance of 7 miles away.  We noticed that
  from 2 miles away, the background count increased slightly, so by the time
  we got back to our camp it had increased by an average of four counts per
  minute for a total of eleven counts per minute.

  Thus we had solved the geiger counter problem and through this method of
  conditioning all three worked fine.  Also, I received word back from Ludlum
  company from whom I purchased the detector and to whom I had sent the first
  one back to for fixing or replacement who indicated he had performed lab
  tests on the geiger counter but found no problems at all, and could offer
  no reason for the unit's failure at our test site.

  From this I deduced the accumulator had directly interferred with the
  detector's operation at the camp location of the experiment.

  So having solved my problems with the detectors, I found that from a
  distance of one hundred feet away from the accumulator, readings nearly
  doubled!  Readings at all locations were substantially lower than at the
  accumulator!  This was most interesting, there was no way the radio active
  (nickel 63) switching tube should be influential since it was covered with
  3/8" inch of lead and 1/8"inches of aluminum.  Added to this was the
  multiple layers of galvanized steel and wood for a gross weight of
  approximately 70 pounds.

  During the monitoring period of the experiment, I noticed that the
  radiation output would gradually increase and then suddenly drop back down
  to nearly zero.  Then the process would start all over each time gaining in
  radio-active output. Prior to this monitoring period some rather unique
  events occurred.

  The first of these was the arrival of mayflies and the breeding activities
  of these insects in the immediate vicinity of our experiment immediately
  following the setting up of the experiment.  This lasted for about 3 hours
  and then they left.

  Following this we observed a bumblebee flying around the experiment which
  suddenly dove straight into the experiment, fell down dead and in less than
  2 hours appeared totally dehydrated and looked as if it had been in the sun
  for days.  Its body was extremely dry and brittle.  Following this, similar
  events occurred with wasps.

  Now during this time the geiger-counter was not functioning and no
  correlation to the radio-activity is definitely known.  However, later when
  the geiger-counter was replaced with one that we had managed to keep in
  operation, I found that the radiation levels would reach a peak and start a
  new cycle.  Many times these peaks would immediately precede some strange
  event.

  An example, on March 26, 1989, about three weeks after I first introduced
  the isotope into the accumulator, I had just finished taking readings on
  the various monitoring equipment at the site of the experiment, when
  suddenly the entire area lit up with a orange cast.  I turned around to see
  its source, and in the sky directly in front of me I observed a bright
  orange-red fireball. This occurred in the evening around 10:45 p.m.

  I estimated this phenomenon to be roughly the size of a basketball, 50 feet
  in the air and moving north to south at approximately 8 m.p.h.  The
  distance from which I observed this was 125 feet.  No noise accompanied
  this nor were there clouds in the area.  This fireball lasted approximately
  5 seconds then disappeared in full view and totally unobscured from sight.

                                     Page 2





  During the field observations there were several times when storms would
  move through the area and also just clouds coming across.  Interestingly
  holes would appear in the clouds as they moved overhead, as if the
  experiment was generating some sort of force field which blocked the
  moisture content of the clouds but after passing through the field the
  holes would quickly fill themselves back in again.

  The most dramatic account occurred when a thunder storm, accompanied by
  strong winds and rain, moved into the area; and even though wind was
  blowing quite hard, and it was pouring down rain all around us, the hole in
  the sky remained and we were able to stay relatively dry.

  After a month of field observations, I moved the experiment back to the
  laboratory where I continued the monitoring of the experiment.  Almost
  immediately upon our arrival, the office computer, phones system and the
  closed circuit t.v. monitors began to malfunction.  The computer would just
  dump and lose all the information that had been typed into it.  This did
  not put me on the programmer's favorite person list and finally the
  computer was just turned off and left off during the remainder of the
  experiment.

  Also the phone system as I mentioned above started to malfunction it would
  have heavy static on the line and would loose connection during a phone
  conversation.  We also experienced a rash of wrong numbers or no answers
  when the phone would ring.

  Customers began to complain that the lines were always busy and they could
  not get through. The phone company sent crew after crew out, but they never
  could fix the problem or tell us why it was happening.  No other businesses
  in the area were experiencing any problems so our equipment was tested and
  was reported to be in perfect working order!

  The T.V. monitoring system was less than 2 months old and was generally so
  full of static that you could hardly tell what you were looking at, it too
  was tested and no apparent reason could be found as to the bad picture on
  the monitor.  However the systems were not always bad; the degree of
  trouble seemed to coincide with the height of the radiation emitted by the
  experiment.

  During the radio-active lulls the equipment would function fine.  One
  Monday morning I decided to clean up my laboratory and after doing so
  returned to the office where the T.V. viewing monitor was located.  While
  watching the different scenes appear on the viewer from the different
  camera locations, my lab appeared on the viewer... the lab appeared just
  like it had before I cleaned and rearranged it.

  I thought someone was playing a joke on me but my lab was cleaned and the
  camera was on but the picture on the monitor was clearly wrong!  I called
  the company that installed the system and they could not explain the
  picture as we had no recording equipment for the system and the rest of the
  cameras were working fine.

  After calling several video experts we found out that this type phenomenon
  was called a "burn-in" which is similar to what happens when a bright light
  is directed into a video camera and the light leaves a trail when it is
  moved away.  However this type was the result of not light but electricity.

  We were told the power required for this type event was generally in the
  kilo-volts or higher and should eventually ware off.  The expert was right,

                                     Page 3





  and the images faded away by the next day, however the question remained as
  to the power source that had caused the problem in the first place?

  A possible solution became apparent about three weeks later.  One evening
  my partner and the secretary were working late and a storm moved into the
  area they noticed that the lightning was unusually heavy and had a variety
  of different colors, red, orange, yellow, green, blue and white.  During
  the storm, they noticed that my lab door was open and the room was filled
  with an electrical type fire, green in color and suspended in mid air!

  They watched this from a distance of sixty feet or so and amidst the light
  show a shadowy figure appeared in front of the door which was about six
  feet tall.  The fire and the figure both remained for about two minutes
  before disappearing.  My partner called me at my house and told me of the
  events that had transpired.

  The next day I found that nothing had been burned and the only evidence
  left was that the T.V. camera was no longer working.  The next day,
  however, the camera once again was working.

  A similar event occurred about 4 weeks later.  I had moved the experiment
  into my office from the lab and one morning while opening the door to the
  office I noticed light coming out from under the door.  When I opened the
  door the room was filled with what appeared to be thousands of little blue
  dots of light about the size of a pin head floating all around the room.

  Within seconds the dots vanished and the room was filled with the smell of
  ozone. ( The same smell produced after a thunder storm or a high voltage
  transformer.) A few weeks later the co-owner of the company was in my
  office discussing a business matter when he leaned against a glass door I
  had covered with a piece of galvanized steel which imparted a sizable shock
  to him and left me quite red faced.

  He thought I had somehow electrified the door and failed to warn him of the
  danger.  I had not electrified the door in any manner and the only
  explanation I could give was that the experimental accumulator was only
  inches away from the door and some how it may have electrified the door.

  After this, it was decided to move the experiment to a back building where
  it would pose no threat to employees or equipment and it could be kept
  separate from the main building as the problems with the phones continued
  to plague our business.  During this time the counts from the geiger-
  counter ranged from 10-120 counts per minute(C.P.M.). Ten C.P.M. being the
  time following the sudden drops from the peaks of which had increased to
  120 C.P.M..

  About three weeks after I had moved the experiment to the isolated building
  the owner, co-owner and myself went to monitor the experiment.  As we
  started to leave, the geiger-counter that had been reading about 78 C.P.M.
  suddenly began registering a rapid climb in C.P.M. until it went off scale.

  Switching to a higher scale we watched in amazement as it proceeded beyond
  the increased counter range.  Once again I switched to a higher range, and
  the counter showed no signs of slowing down.  Now the C.P.M.'s were over
  100,000!  The clicks of the counter sounded like a machine gun and if we
  were measuring radio-activity then the danger to us was becoming too great
  and so we made a hasty retreat.

  The distance away from the experiment we monitored the first onset of the

                                     Page 4





  rapid climb in C.P.M. was seven feet.  The distance away from the
  experiment still reading a climb in C.P.M. was thirty-eight feet!

  We returned to the area thirty minutes later and the C.P.M.'s were down to
  27 C.P.M.  During the next few weeks the peaks topped out around 70 C.P.M.
  and no other extraordinarily high readings were observed.

  I once again moved the experiment. This time I moved it to a location which
  had better accessibility so I could monitor it easier. Three weeks later
  while taking measurements I contracted a headache and became slightly
  nauseous.  After leaving the area the headache and nausea left me as
  suddenly as it has arrived.

  This led me to believe that the experiment was somehow responsible, so I
  called over a lab assistant and asked him to go into the room and retrieve
  my note book.  After doing so he commented on the fact that the room felt
  stuffy and he too had experienced a mild head ache while in the room. It
  was at this point that I decided to stop the experiment. I was satisfied
  that Dr.  Reich's observations in regards to the effects of Orgone
  accumulator on a radio-active isotope had merit.

  I shut down the accumulator by pouring salt-water into the core and
  saturated all the layers with salt-water.  This has effectively stopped the
  effects of the experiment and the isotope has been removed from the
  accumulator.  The conclusions that I reached from this experiment are:

     That Orgone theory is the key as claimed by Dr. Reich in regard to the
     applications he cited.

  I hope others will repeat this experiment and make known the results they
  obtain.  As I have done this experiment only once I do not know for a fact
  that the events I noted were in fact due to the accumulator or were merely
  coincidence.

  But I do know that this was one of the most exciting years of my life.  The
  partner funding my research experienced some financial problems and we will
  continue once funding is available for this venture, but until that day
  arrives I leave this diary of the events.

  Vangard Notes

     Ron McWilliams has been a friend for several years now.  We first met at
     a Star Trek convention in the Dallas area where I was manning a video
     booth for the then MUFON MetroPlex UFO group of which I was President.

     I was showing the Meiers video from Switzerland and Ronnie and I struck
     up  a  conversation.    We  found  many  common  interests, especially
     harmonizing on the intent of technical duplication for useful devices.
     Ron was hesitant to mention any details of his own Reichian experiment,
     but he eventually gave me the inside story.  I then helped him write up
     a research proposal which he used to gain funding for the project.

     Chuck Henderson is our resident Reich Honcho, although I am not
     unfamiliar with the material.  Being aware of Reichs' work, I knew he
     said that Orgone energy attracted moisture and would accelerate the
     decay of radioactive sources.  Bearing that in mind, you can see the
     quite interesting correlations with Ronnie's experiment.

     I must point out that Ron and I had heavy discussions regarding the

                                     Page 5





     dangers Reich pointed out with regard to the production of DOR as
     manifested by radioactive sources.  He insisted that his device was

     designed to absorb those rays before they could escape and reap havoc.

     In fact, now that I recall the ORIGINAL proposal, it was for an Orgone
     Power Generator based on the use of atomic batteries.

     The basic premise was that atomic batteries were available that would
     capture  beta  and  gamma  emissions,  and  convert  those  directly  to
     electricity.

     If a radioactive element was inserted into a properly constructed Orgone
     Accumulator with collection plates to channel the emissions to the
     appropriate battery, then the device would directly produce electrical
     power that would be proportionate to the degree of orgone excitation.

     The use of a pyramidal container was also in the original proposal
     although I felt a spherical container might be more appropriate because
     of  the  lack  of  studies  with  regard  to  radioactive  energies in
     conjunction with pyramid amplification.

     However, it was Ron's idea and I was honored to be in the know about it
     before, during and after the project.  It was kept quiet all this time
     until Ron decided he could do no more with it and kindly sent it to us
     here at KeelyNet.

     Around the time of the project, I received a call from Joel Carlinsky.
     We discussed the project and Joel went BALLISTIC over the phone.  I
     explained that Ron and I had discussed the possible problems and he was
     quite aware of them.

     In an attempt to minimize the dangers, he chose to use a test site that
     is about 45 miles from the Dallas area and about 7 miles from a small
     town (Canton, site of the largest Flea Market in the United States - 1st
     Monday Trade Days).

     This area of research is still wide open and the use of the Orgone for
     power generation is quite intriguing.  I'd like to thank Ron for sharing
     this with all of us.
