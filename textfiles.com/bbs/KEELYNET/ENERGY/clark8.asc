              THE REICH ANSWER TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS, REACTORS AND WASTE

                                        by

                              Richard L. Clark, Ph.D.

       The research of Wilhelm Reich describes the reaction of Orgone
       Energy to nuclear materials -- that is, it increases tremendously
       the rate of decay (half Life) of the nuclear materials.  Thus, a
       nuclear weapons system, reactor pile, or waste area bombarded by
       Reich Orgone Energy would fail safe by losing its radioactivity
       potential and becoming an inert mass.  Fifteen minutes of exposure
       to Orgone Energy would reduce the core of a typical nuclear reactor
       to lead.  This process would normally take millions of years.

       Orgone Energy and nuclear radiation energy are perfect antithetical
       systems  and  cancel  each  other  out  without  harmful  human or
       environmental side effects of any kind.

       The Orgone Energy immersion system that would be most applicable to
       deactivating  nuclear  systems  of  all  types  would  be  the Reich
       Accumulator Cloudbuster System.  (A Cloudbuster consists of several
       long metal tubes, with one end connected with a wire to a body of
       moving water.  For additional details on construction and operation
       of accumulators and Cloudbusters, contact:  Natural Energy Works, PO
       Box  864,  El  Cerrito,  California  94530.    Include  $1.00  for a
       catalog.)

       The range of a Cloudbuster is almost infinite, limited only by line
       of sight problems.  The energy transfer functions are near linear
       unity and not the square of the distance losses of ordinary energy
       systems.

       Simple construction and testing of a Cloudbuster on a nuclear sample
       will convince even the hardest skeptic that there is no real nuclear
       problem.  There was only a technology gap between pro-nukes and
       anti-nukes.  Now that knowledge gap has diminished to zero.

       A secondary issue that portable Cloudbusters would settle is the
       Government's denial of the existence of UFOs, or flying saucers.
       The Cloudbuster can shoot down these officially nonexistent objects
       with ease.  Reich himself proved this fact thirty years ago;  the

                                      Page 1





       Government knows this.  The sauces are very real and very earthly in
       origin.  Their primary power is a nuclear reactor -- thus the
       Cloudbuster can deactivate them.

       The Russian spy satellite with its nuclear reactor powered radar
       over the Malvinas is typical of the nuclear farce.  All the major
       powers are fully aware of the effect of Orgone Energy on nuclear
       material.

       An Orgone Energy shield, easy and cheap to build, would render any
       country invulnerable to nuclear attack.
