       The following is  brief  essay  on  some  thoughts  I've  had  about
       travelling through time.  I would be interested in anyone's comments
       about the possibility. I may be reached at

             Discourse on the likelihood of inventing a "Time Machine"

       Common in science fiction literature  is the concept of an invention
       that would propel the user forward or backward in time.  Though very
       appealing in print,  it would seem to violate at least  one  law  of
       physics and to  necessitate, besides the device to transcend time, a
       second device that would allow symultaneous  movement through space.
       What I would like to do in this short essay, is describe some of the
       difficulties time travel presents.

       The first difficulty I see is one of human recorded  history.  If we
       were to assume  that  at  sometime  in  the  future a device to move
       through time is to be invented, and  that  it will be used, then why
       has not history ever recorded the arrival of a time traveller?

       Given the capability to travel to far off times, what would the time
       traveller's motive be?  To only observe events and  people would, in
       my opinion, be  very a aloof thing to do.  Given the ability to talk
       with people of past times, it would be irresistible not to.

       Why would a time traveller want  to  travel  through  time?   We all
       could make lists of people we would like to speak with  or of events
       we would like  to  see.   But, to my knowledge, there is no recorded
       instance of a traveller appearing  who talked of moving through time
       and left behind knowledge of the future.

       But this "negative  evidence"  is  not  conclusive.   There  may  be
       physical principles at  work  which would prevent the traveller from
       interacting with others.  These physical  principles  would  prevent
       the traveller from ever leaving in the first place.

       Every upper elementary  student,  while  studying science,  has  run
       across the laws  of  conservation  of  matter  and  energy. Each law
       states that matter or energy cannot be created nor destroyed only

                                      Page 1





       changed into a different form.

       Matter is defined  as  anything  that  takes  up space and has mass.
       Matter can be thought of as "the  stuff"  of  existence.   Matter is
       made up of tiny particles called atoms.  There are  about  106 known
       different types of atoms.

       The stuff that  makes  up you or me or anything else in the universe
       is discrete and individual, that is,  it  cannot be in two places at
       the same time nor can two different atoms occupy the same space.

       Now, if time travel were possible, could the following ever happen:

               The time machine is to be tested with a mouse  to  ensure it
               will be  safe  for  human  use.   The mouse is placed in the
               device and it is sent five  minutes  into  the  future.  The
               machine disappears and five minutes later  the  machine  and
               mouse appear.  So far so good.

               It is  now  sent five minutes into the past.  Here the first
               problem appears.  Five minutes before you sent the mouse off
               to the  past  you  did not  notice  a  second  mouse  appear
               securely strapped in a second time machine.   The researcher
               did not see the mouse appear before it has left.

               Even if  the mouse did appear, there would be two mice, each
               composed of the same atoms.    Again, the same matter cannot
               be in two places at the same time.

       The atoms that  make  up  the  time traveller and his  machine  were
       continuously recycled through  past  time.   The atoms in my fingers
       and toes and everywhere in between  were  used by other organisms in
       other times or were locked up in the rocks, water,  and  air  of the
       earth.  If I  were to travel back in time, my atoms would already be
       in use somewhere else.  How could I exist then at that time?

       A second problem to be faced with a working time machine is one that
       involves the addition of movement through space.

       Matter in the universe takes up  space,  that  is,  it  has  length,
       width, and depth.   These  are  the  three  dimensions   all  matter
       possess.  There is also a fourth dimension.  The dimension of time.

       All matter exists in space and moves through time.  You move through
       space as you  go  through  the  day.   The earth and the rest of the
       planets and their moons, moves through space as they circle the sun.

       The sun moves through space as it  moves with the rest of the galaxy
       around the galactic center and, as you can imagine,  the  galaxy  is
       moving through the   universe.    All  this  movement  is  happening
       simultaneously, but we are not aware  of  it  (thank  goodness,  for
       those of us who suffer from motion sickness.).

       The computation of  all this relative movement is  crucial  for  the
       successful rendezvous of  satellites with the planets and moons they
       are to observe.

       The earth and other planets DO NOT RETURN to the same spaces as they
       orbit the sun.  All matter in the universe, when you compute these

                                      Page 1





       motions, are SPIRALING  THROUGH  SPACE.   The  orbits  are  not neat
       ellipses.

       To get back to our time traveller,  as  he  moves  back in time, the
       earth, sun, and galaxy have all moved relative to each  other.   The
       traveller would most  probably  find  himself out in space somewhere
       rather than watching the signing of  the Declaration of Independence
       or being there for Superbowl I.

       The time machine would need some way of computing  where  the  earth
       would be for any date in history and a means of getting there.

       All this is fun to speculate upon.  Though I reckon that time travel
       is not possible,  I'm  not  100%  certain.  I still hold out that at
       some-time in the  future  the  problems   mentioned   here  will  be
       clarified.

       Someday there might be a battered old blue police box like Dr. Who's
       TARDIS, his Time  And  Relative  Dimension  in Space  machine.   The
       Doctor recognized the  difficulties  of  movement  through space and
       time, but only in story can he transport  us  to  any  point  in the
       universe at any point in time.  Until then, I can only wait out time
       and carry myself through space.

       Wait a minute,  what am I doing sitting over there, laughing.

       Vangard Notes...

           In regard to the very outdated concept that atoms are "recycled"
           throughout the  Universe,  evidence,  indeed,  rational  thought
           refutes the  idea.  Matter is converted back into energy and the
           energy is again converted into mass on a continual basis.

           As time   progresses,   ALL   THINGS   CHANGE,   including   the
           morphogenetic fields   which   organize  all   matter   in   its
           characteristic and  uniquely  individual  form.  Keely refers to
           this process by the analogy of stamping out 1,000 coins from the
           same press.

           Each coin  will  be  slightly  different  due  to  the  infinite
           possibilities offered  by the variations in the  consistency  of
           the metal in each coin, slight variations in the pressure of the
           press for  each  coin,  dents,  etc which can further affect the
           "signature" of each coin.  Not  to  mention  the  influences  of
           other waves  ranging  from  sound to light to cosmic  influences
           even unto planetary bodies of the system.

           Indeed, Keely  says that simply touching the coin will alter the
           "signature" of the coin.  The  entire  concept  of  Sympathy  as
           opposed to Resonance can be equated to "fine tuning"  or "coarse
           tuning".   By  this  definition,  Sympathy  tunes  to the entire
           "signature" over  a  wide  range   of   frequencies   and  phase
           relationships, while   Resonance   tunes   to  the   fundamental
           frequency of  the  mass  without  regard  for  the  many  subtle
           harmonics.

           The magic in the phenomena generated  by  Keely  was due to this
           understanding which  allowed  him to build ever  more  sensitive
           mechanisms for   the   analysis   and  tuning  to  such  complex
           waveforms.
                                      Page 3





           Back to  Time  Travel,  Keely states quite matter-of-factly that
           "TIME IS GRAVITY".  He says that  the flow of "gravity" into the
           neutral center of a mass determines the degree  of time to which
           the mass will be affected.

           Note that  the  ruling flows will be those of the greatest mass,
           in other words, the Earth dictates  the primary time flow for us
           with our mass densities presenting the secondary time flows.

           As to the movement of bodies through space, there  is indication
           that the  Aether  drift  of  the  Earth  would  sustain  a  time
           travelling body in such a manner  that  it  would  not leave the
           energy domain of the ruling mass in which it resides.

           Here Aether is seen as the flow of force into the neutral center
           of all  masses  which  serves  to  aggregate  and   sustain  the
           existence of  the  mass in the physical form.  Refer to NEUTRAL1
           for a  better  understanding   of   one   of   Keely's  greatest
           discoveries.

           High intensity  magnetic  (or  other) fields appear  capable  of
           altering the  flow  of  Aether  into the Neutral centers of mass
           which therefore alters time to  some  degree.   At this point in
           time, there is almost no written literature on  this subject nor
           many reports  beyond  the Philadelphia Experiment which indicate
           the dangers or possibilities of such an experiment.

           We have found in the UFO literature some fascinating indications
           that AGING DOES NOT OCCUR or  is  greatly  attenuated for living
           organisms immersed  in an inertial dampening field  which  comes
           with the  territory  of  anti-gravity.   Alleged interviews with
           aliens frequently report a physique  indicative  of  a  20 to 35
           year old, yet the being claims to be in excess  of  1000 of "our
           Earth (note this) years".

           Further questions  on  this  matter  directed towards the beings
           lead to the statement that the  aging  process is greatly slowed
           WHILE IN  THE  PRESENCE  OF  THE  SHIP FIELD and  that  movement
           outside this  field  will  subject  their  bodies  to  the aging
           effects of the planetary body  in  dominion.   Look  in  the UFO
           secion and the BIOLOGY section for further details, particularly
           DNAMAST2.

           We welcome comments on the above subjects as  we  find  definite
           correlations from many diverse (and to some, fantastic) sources.
