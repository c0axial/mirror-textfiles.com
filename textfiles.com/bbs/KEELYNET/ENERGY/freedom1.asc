       The following file  is  one  that  is "in creation" and is dependent
       your feedback, thoughts, ideas and comments.
       The purpose is the creation of an  article that will show WHAT COULD
       BE based on current, near future and far future technologies.
       It should paint a picture of what life COULD BE LIKE  were we to get
       off our butts  and  do  something  constructive, not just sharing of
       information, but also  experiments,   verification   of  claims  and
       working devices.

       from a message on KeelyNet

          Hi John!  You must be reading my mind.....I was  going  to  do  a
          version and  place  it  online  for review by others who would no
          doubt have insights that I would miss, then when we get everyones
          various ideas, make it into a very interesting file....you know,
                        What to expect from all this mess?
          ...something kind of on that order.   In fact, here are the notes
          I wrote up last night as a kind of guideline based  on  the stuff
          that is here NOW or very close...

       Conversion of current vehicle/transport technology in a slow process
       and based on  ideas  as  shown in Back to the Future.  In the movie,
       there were cars  that  converted from  ground  to  flying  vehicles.
       These took advantage  of modified vehicles AS WE CURRENTLY  USE  for
       ground transportation alone.   The  idea  of skylanes which vectored
       into towns, roads or cities was quite inspired.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Industry would phase in with construction  of these various machines
       with the need for replacement parts, repair/maintenance of operating
       units, possibly built-in obsolescence of 5-30 years, power units for
       home Central, automobile,  aircraft,  watercraft,   spacecraft   and
       portable sources.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Future society would  be  based  on expansion of human knowledge and
       arts through fact finding projects, exploration, colonization, trade
       and commerce (exchange of services, goods or credits).
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Individuals, groups, small businesses  and  larger  companies  would
       build products or offer services for small markets  PRIMARILY  on  a
       community based level  as  in  the  age  old free market concept and
       these must comply with basic quality standards.
       Sales of these products, crafts, services,  etc. would be through in
       LOCAL markets or   through  state,  national,  or   world   commerce
       channels.  Communities would become SELF-SUPPLYING with "imports" of
       higher technology goods  from communities that chose to focus on the
       manufacture of such goods.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       One problem that  is a major obstacle  is  how  to  overcome  vested
       interests especially in convincing them that all this  can be PHASED
       IN successfully with  the  absolute  MINIMUM  of  DISRUPTION  to the
       economy or current   technologies.     These    groups,   companies,
       governments or individuals  MUST  change  to  accomodate   the   new
       technologies and freedoms  that  would  NECESSARILY  come  from  the
       gradual implementation of free energy, anti-grav, etc.
       Why should we try to get such companies  or vested interests to work
       WITH this rather than AGAINST us?  Because they are so entrenched in
       the minds of people as well as almost absolute rulers of the economy
       and legal system.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       What options do we have beyond dependency on the open  armed welcome
       of vested interests  who have managed to suppress such expansion for
       so many decades?

       Positives
          1)  We have computer networks
          2)  We have access to photocopiers
          3)  We have newsletters
          4)  We have meetings
          5)  We have multiple level marketing
          6)  We have our own set of contacts (each of us)
          7)  We have friends, relatives and acquaintances
          8)  We have open mindedness to new concepts and ideas
          9)  We understand the concept of  shareware and that the majority
              of people would be more than happy to contribute  to plans or
              machines THAT WORK in a practical sense

       Negatives
          1)  People get greedy
          2)  People  get selfish and seek power or control of a process or
              technology






          3)  Why should people or companies change the status quo for some
              half-baked idea or machine that would REMOVE THE VICTIMS from
              centralized sources  (that  can  be metered and thus the user
              can be charged)?
          4)  We don't have funding for our  plans, machines or research to
              develop those machines
          5)  Inventors/researchers many times get involved with investment
              groups who legally tie up a machine or technology
          6)  Inventors/researchers fear that their discovery will be taken
              away from  them  without  appreciation  or compensation,  why
              should they share their work for free or without GUARANTEE OF
              JUST COMPENSATION?
          7)  Inventors   frequently   die   before  sharing  or  recording
              sufficient information that others may carry on the work
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       So HOW would this phasing in WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEMS take place?

          - taxes must continue to support  government  projects especially
            funding of  technology  or  product invention and  manufacture,
            this includes   basic  R  &  D  along  with  manufacturing  and
            marketing.
            And for  this  we are talking  SMALL  GROUPS  OR  COMPANIES  as
            getting THE LION'S SHARE of the funding as their ideas are more
            radical and  thus far-reaching and closer to  achievement  than
            the overloaded  and  self-impeding  teams  at bigger companies.
            Precision, speed, willingness  to try are the hallmark of small
            companies that are radically successful.
            This funding for companies MUST also include folks  who  AREN'T
            REQUIRED TO  HAVE  A  PHD  or other "accredited" certification.
            Willingness to learn and the optimism of future thinkers...that
            is a PIVOTAL POINT in all this type of research...

          - automobiles  and  trucks  must   be   "weaned"  away  FROM  the
            consumption of  gasoline  TO  the  use  of  HYDROGEN,   through
            conversions of  current  vehicles  to  hydrogen generators that
            would be available from garages  as  a  bring  it in, we do the
            conversion, you pay us and go.
            This conversion could also come in KITS for those  who  wish to
            install it  themselves.   Government subsidies would be granted
            to those desiring this conversion of OLDER vehicles.

            NEW VEHICLES  would have this  ON  DEMAND  hydrogen  generators
            BUILT-IN DIRECTLY and people would again be ENCOURAGED  to  get
            away from  the  older vehicles (even the conversions) and go to
            the new which have ENGINES DESIGNED  TO WORK OPTIMALLY with the
            hydrogen as the combustible fuel.

          - Thermopile/thermocouples could also be attached to the hydrogen
            generators to capture and convert most of the heat into useable
            power

          - for homes, there is the DennisLee heat pump system which can be
            GREATLY EXPANDED to provide local HOT/COLD AIR for the home
            environment, HOT/COLD  WATER  for  home use and  very  probably
            electricity

          - also  for  the  home,  there  is a superior heat pump generator
            which I have seen in action  that  will  operate on temperature
            differentials of as little as 3 degrees F...this  would provide
            motive force for LOCAL POWER GENERATION






          - Atmospheric   Water   Precipitators   that   use   condensation
            "membranes" to precipitate water  DIRECTLY from circulating air
            and which  collects in tanks to be drawn out  as  needed...thus
            water can  be  used  as is or further filtered...this minimizes
            "used" water  that  is  fluoridated/chlorinated   or  otherwise
            contaminated from natural water

          - Health  - where a morning shower/shave entails  standing  on  a
            metal plate  which  uses  HYBRID  TECHNOLOGIES  including  RIFE
            frequencies, MWO frequencies, UV/OZONE to bombard the body with
            signals designed to destroy bacteria/viruses as well as enhance
            the immune system by stimulation
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Industries based ON THE ABOVE would provide ample opportunities for
       forward looking current companies  to  PHASE  in  the newest FREEDOM
       TECHNOLOGIES and yet still make money since these devices have to be
       built, tested, marketed and maintained.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       The problem is how to get it going in a BIG WAY from the "git go" to
       prevent all the  interferences  generated as legal  altercations  or
       other suppressive influences    by    vested   interests   including
       governments, large companies that  rely  on METERED SERVICES as well
       as individuals or  groups  who make large sums of money  daily  from
       people who have   never   been   allowed   the   FREEDOM  of  energy
       independence.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       I feel that networks and multiple  level  and/or mail order will all
       play a significant  part  in  bringing this about....but  the  FIRST
       PRIORITY must be the development or duplication of WORKING DEVICES.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       When people become aware that working systems ARE AVAILABLE and can
       either be bought in KIT form, purchased as OUTRIGHT WORKING UNITS or
       can BE INSTALLED BY "authorized" servicemen...the world will be OURS
       in that we will have achieved a MAJOR STEP in the right direction.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       That is close   to  the  One  World  Order  idea  because  with  the
       achievement of practical levitation, borders will begin to dissolve.
       With cooperation among  nations  and  the  general  raising  of  the
       standard of living of all countries, we cannot HELP but to evolve to
       a more GESTALT  (group  mind)  approach  to  problems  and  solution
       sharing as evinced in Star Trek with the "Federation".
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       With the advent of practical space travel, COLONIZATION will be then
       come into its  own  as  one of the greatest stimuli to the one world
       concept that could ever be, ESPECIALLY  knowing  that one can take a
       portable power plant that uses ZPE (zero point energy),  hydrogen or
       other sources, include  a  maintenance  kit or spare parts, your own
       way to levitate and the universe is your oyster....
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       This is the beginning of a paper to  show  what IS, what COULD BE in
       the immediate future  (should  everyone FREELY SHARE  their  working
       plans) and the  FAR  FUTURE.   The  main  focus  HOWEVER  should  be
       EXISTING devices that  can be combined  in  HYBRID  ARRANGEMENTS  to
       achieve practical results as in our bulletin #3....
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       So, take this information as a skeleton, think about it in light of
       what you know or suspect.  Then you can either upload your ideas for
       inclusion into an article (credit given unless you  do  not wish it)
       for the BBS  and possibly for Borderland or whoever...TO SHOW PEOPLE
       THAT IT *IS* POSSIBLE TO USE THIS  STUFF,  however, it involves time
       and investment using proven workable techniques.




       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       What part can you play in making such concepts a REALITY?

       If you are an inventor or researcher,

           SHARE YOUR  IDEAS  or  PLANS  with others, making sure that your
           papers give you credit for your  work.  In Shareware, the author
           asks that  should  a user find it worthy of use,  that  a  small
           contribution be sent to the inventor/author.

           This SHAREWARE  concept  relies  on  the  basic  honesty of most
           people although there are folks  who  will  take  and or USE the
           technology without  any  feeling of ripping off  someone  else's
           work.  Those  people  will  live  to regret the circle that they
           created and will eventually harvest.   They should be encouraged
           to YIELD to their higher influences.

           Try to  prevent  getting  tied  up  with  investors   who   will
           eventually get  greedy  and  seek  for  the highest payback.  At
           least get a good lawyer and contract.   In  that  process,  your
           work COULD be tied up AND NEVER COME TO PRACTICAL USE!

           Share your  work with AMPLE NOTICE THAT YOU DID  IT  AND  EXPECT
           SOMETHING IN RETURN IF IT IS USED.

       If you are a company or investor,

           Seek out  inventors and researchers of radical technologies, ask
           for a working demonstration (with  non-disclosures EXPECTED) and
           don't worry about the NOT INVENTED HERE mentality.

           Once the  machine  is  proven  to  work  and under  normal  NON-
           LABORATORY conditions,  work  up  kits through separate sources.
           Construct the  machine  in  separate  stages  or  at  a  central
           location.  USE NETWORKS and mailing lists to GET THE PRODUCT OUT
           to as many people as possible BEFORE suppressive influences come
           into play.   Once  a great majority of people  are  USING  THESE
           MACHINES, the opening MUST GROW to allow open sales.

           ALWAYS REMEMBER THE INVENTOR!  He did not necessarily do all the
           work out  of love, but expects compensation so that he can GO ON
           TO IMPROVE HIS INVENTIONS OR DISCOVER OTHER PRODUCTS.

           If you as a business, treat the  inventors well, they will BRING
           YOU THEIR  NEXT  INVENTION.   Be first, be poised  to  strike  a
           receptive market,  get  the  lion's  share  of  the first orders
           BEFORE others  jump  on  the bandwagon,  then  go  to  the  NEXT
           PRODUCT.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       GESTALT IN ACTION with ADAPTIVE RESPONSES should be our way of life
       instead of just some high sounding verbiage...thanks......>>>  Jerry
