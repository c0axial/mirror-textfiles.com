       Description: Tesla coil output connected to matched, coaxial bucking
                    coils.
                    Output measurements  taken  using an analog volt meter,
                    with leads removed, and  placed in the proximity of the
                    coils.
                    Additionally, a NE-2H lamp was used  to  determine  the
                    presence of  radiated  energy,  and a standard AM radio
                    was used  to  "listen"   to  output  variations  during
                    testing.  (see    NEONDET.ZIP,   or    NEONDET.ASC    &
                    NEONDET.GIF)

       Two matching coils were wound, each coil consisting of 3.5 meters of
       75 Ohm coaxial cable.  The core diameter of the coils is the same as
       the diameter of the Tesla coil secondary windings.

       The coils were wound in opposite direction relative to each other,
       with one wound CW and the other wound CCW.  Approximately one inch
       of insulation and shield was removed from the cut ends of each coil,
       and the connector ends were left intact.

       The coils were  placed  next  to each other, and the output from the
       Tesla secondary was connected to  each  of  the  coils at the center
       conductors, and jumpered   to   the   shields  to  eliminate   stray
       capacitance.

       When two matching  coils  of this type are placed along side of each
       other and energized  with alternating  current,  their  fields  will
       "buck" each other,  effectively  cancelling the EM  fields  of  both
       coils.  As such, the "cancelled" energy is combined to form a scalar
       wave of twice the input frequency.  Additionally, it was found that:

          1.  An  energy  "well"  was  formed in the inside diameter of the
              coils, as  detected by testing  with  a  NE-2H  plasma  lamp,
              connected on  one  lead  to a 24" jumper cable.   The  "well"
              appears to  be  in  the  shape  of  an hourglass, with energy
              concentrated at the juncture between the coils.  When the NE-

                                      Page 1





              2H was lowered into the "well", it would illuminate. However,
              if the  NE-2H  was  connected  to  the  Tesla output and then
              lowered into  the  well, it  would  extinguish.   The  "well"
              appears to be a vortex of energy which extinguished  the lamp
              by depleting  the  charge.   As the lamp exited the "well" at
              the lower end, the lamp once again illuminated.

          2.  The Tesla coil output is  effectively  doubled  in  terms  of
              radiated energy,  as  measured  from  the open  ends  of  the
              bucking coils.

          3.  The Tesla coil appears to operate more stably at its resonant
              frequency with the matched coils connected to its output.

          4.  Radiated energy from the bucking coils increases considerably
              with distance from the Tesla secondary.

       Observations:

       Applying a matched  impedance  device  to  a  Tesla coil output will
       improve the stability and output dynamics  of  the coil.  The device
       must be able  to  withstand  the level of output without  dielectric
       breakdown.

       Using bucking coils  is a method for creating scalar potential, thus
       there should exist a scalar potential  in the gap between the coils,
       extending on a horizontal plane.  Therefore, the bucking coils are a
       matched impedance scalar antenna/translator for the Tesla coil.

       The alternate phase inversions should cancel magnetic  fields.   The
       first set of  bucking coils exhibited dual sets of polarized fields.
       After rewinding the  coils more carefully,  the  stray  fields  were
       eliminated.

       An additional set  of  matching  bucking  coils  should  work  in  a
       complementary manner with  the  first  set,  permitting  the  scalar
       energy from each set to translate  back  into  EM  energy, forming a
       "Tesla Shield" in the gap between the coils.  This will be attempted
       next.

       Having wound an additional set of matching coils for the above test,
       it was found  that  the  "Tesla Shield" could not be  created.   The
       added load of  an  extra set of coils saturated the Tesla secondary,
       causing output to drop below measurable  emission levels.  This test
       will be repeated using another Tesla coil of similar  constructionto
       power the extra set of coils.

       Additional test data  concerning  the  Tesla  coil output to bucking
       coils.

       Test Set-up:  Tesla secondary connected  to  twin,  stacked  coaxial
                     coils which  are arranged in a bucking  configuration,
                     so that  the  windings  rotate in opposing directions.
                     At the center of the test stack, a scalar potential
                     should exist which  is  equal  to double the amplitude
                     and frequency of the Tesla secondary output.





       Observations: It was observed that the coils form a "negative energy
                     vortex", which  depleted  the electrons from energized
                     circuits which are placed in the vortex field, causing
                     those circuits to extinguish.   It was also found that
                     the radiated  energy  of the coils,  relative  to  the
                     Tesla coil, was much greater.
                     To fully test the theory of the vortex, one additional
                     test was  required, that being a reversal of direction
                     of the energized circuit into the vortex field.

       Result of Test:

       A NE-2H on a 24" jumper was lowered into the field.  The jumper was
       connected to the Tesla secondary.   Upon  entering  the  vortex, the
       lamp extinguished.  Continuing to lower the lamp until it was out of
       the vortex resulted in the lamp lighting.

       If a vortex exixts, it must be possible to enter the  lamp  from the
       bottom of the  stack,  and see it extinguish where it previously had
       lit, and upon exiting the top, it  should  light where it previously
       had extinguished.

       This test was  performed  successfully  several  times.   It  is  my
       opinion that this  is  due  to  the  direction  of  energies  in the
       vortical flow.  Energy is "pulled"  from  the  lamp as it enters the
       vortex from either direction, and "pushed" into the lamp as it exits
       the vortex.  This test was performed both before and after reversing
       the lamp connection  between  coils,  to  be certain  that  a  phase
       inversion was not  causing the lamp to light or extinguish.  Results
       are identical regardless of which coil is connected to the lamp.

       I would also  like to note that I  have  been  experiencing  fatigue
       since the beginning of this test, which may or may not be related to
       the energy absorption properties of the coils.  I consider the tests
       to be complete at this time.

       If you choose  to  experiment with this device, please  note  Joel's
       comment regarding a  fatigue.   This  could  be  tested  by  plants,
       insects or animals to note reduced  activity when in the presence of
       such a field.   However, please take precautions when  experimenting
       with these unknown qualities.
