       Watson, Jr., in 1985.

       There was no diagram of the device described herein,  only the text.
       The paper came  to  me  via a friend who received it at a local "UFO

                          SPACE CURVE GENERATOR OVERVIEW

       The purpose of this paper is to acquaint the reader with the concept
       behind the Space  Curve  Generator.   First  the   theory   will  be
       presented and then a description of the workings and construction of
       the machine.

       I would like to begin with a portion of a lecture delivered by Tesla
       to the IEEE on May 20, 1891.  He said that the Ether surrounding the
       molecules is under a strain or in motion.

       The spinning of  the  molecules  and their (entrained) Ether sets up
       Ether tensions or electrostatic strains;   the equalization of Ether
       tensions sets up Ether motions or electric currents, and the orbital
       movements produce the effects of electro- and permanent magnetism.

       Another statement made in his paper,  "The Problem of Increasing
       Human Energy", was that a stick of dynamite was like  a "consumptive
       breath" in comparison  to  a  capacitive  discharge.  It [capacitive
       discharge] produces the  most  powerful  disturbance  in  the  Ether
       known.

       This machine produces or takes advantage of this  strain  or  stress
       and uses time as an advantage in prolonging the effects produced.

       The idea is that, when a capacitor is discharged, tremendous energy
       is realized for  a very short period of time.  This energy is in the
       form of BOTH voltage and current;  whereas  in  an inductor both ARE
       NOT PRESENT on discharge.

                                      Page 1





       Even though this discharge is in a pulsed condition it is fed into a
       circuit that takes  the  pulse  and  lengthens the time in which the
       power is realized.

       For instance, if we had a pulse of  12000  volts  and 100 amps, this
       gives us a momentary power of 1.2 megawatts!

       Now even to the average observer the idea becomes clear  in that, if
       there was a way to stretch this action out over a period of time, we
       would realize a tremendous amount of power for an input of 360 watts
       of power.

       The reader should  be aware that this action takes place at the rate
       of 120 Hz, and the output of the  device  is  at 60 Hz, so it avails
       itself to the   conventional  power  transmission   and   means   of
       utilization.

       The principal workings are as follows:

          First a source of outside power is needed to supply the original
          trigger feed   to  the  system.   This  is  fed  into  a  step-up
          transformer and the result is a  high-potential  output.  This in
          turn feeds a capacitive bank and stores the electricity in same.

          Next a  single  cap  is made to momentarily discharge  through  a
          spark gap or a high-speed mercury interrupter.  This impulse is
          a high potential - high current surge and in turn is fed through
          an inductor of very low resistance.  This is in turn stepped down
          through a   special  transformer  sequence  to  obtain  a  usable
          voltage.

          The current  for the most part  remains  constant  and  may  even
          climb.  The  extra  energy  is  realized  as a result  of  taking
          advantage of the first impulse of the capacitive discharge.

            ** (There may be pages missing here, as the next page
                seems to be the start of another brief paper.) **


       The purpose of  this  paper is an attempt to explain the interaction
       of electrical currents and the harnessing of the same.

       If E=mc^2, and the charge on an object  is a stress proportionate to
       the speed of  light,  then  the  vectoring  of  charge   to  current
       propagates at the speed of light.

       By defining current as Ether in motion, and not as charge in motion,
       then it will  be understood that current and charge are separated by
       a definite angle of ninety degrees.

       The charge can be considered spatial  or an incompressible stress on
       mass such as a hydrolic pressure, and this pressure is equivalent to
       the speed of light.  The mass being compressible  at  the  speed  of
       light squared is therefore at half of its energy stress level.

       To explain more clearly:

          if the stress level were increased to the factor of the speed
          of light squared, then the mass would be converted to energy.

                                      Page 2





       This over-stress level  is  most  noticed  in  the permanent magnet,
       where this stress  can  be  re-vectored  into  electric  current  by
       passing a conductor through the area of this stress.

       The stress (stressed Ether) is transferred to the conductor  via  an
       equalization effect created  by  high  and  low  potential  existing
       between the iron atoms and the copper  atoms;  therefore  a  current
       flow is produced.

       A point should now be made clear in that the stress  in  a  magnetic
       field is not  in  the  form  of charge, but is rather in the form of
       orbital condition of the Ether.  Where  charge is a condition of the
       Ether and mass spinning in harmony, the magnetic or  B  field is the
       result of the orbital condition of the mass and Ether spin.

       The curious aspect  is  that  the  iron  atom  is the only mass that
       displays this naturally.   If  we   could  then  take  and  build  a
       condition in which the components of current and voltage  equal  the
       speed of light  squared, and then vector this to total stress on the
       mass of the conductor, it in turn would release the stored energy of
       the mass itself.

       By then converting this released energy  to both current and voltage
       we have increased our overall power output.  Keeping  in mind that a
       capacitive discharge is  not  only  the most disruptive occurence in
       the Ether, but also creates a net  stress  on  the  same, it is seen
       that the capacitive  medium  not  only stores stress  but  also  the
       current is the first component to lead on discharge.

       As was mentioned earlier, if the resultant stress on the mass of the
       circuit were equal  to the speed of light in that this stress was in
       the form of compressive stress on  the  mass, then an energy release
       would ensue.

       This action becomes evident upon the rapid discharge  and opening of
       a capactive circuit  timed  within  the first half of the first time
       constant, where voltage  and  current  are  at  max  for  the  given
       circuit.  In this manner ENERGY MAY BE MINED from mass  in  a unique
       manner.
