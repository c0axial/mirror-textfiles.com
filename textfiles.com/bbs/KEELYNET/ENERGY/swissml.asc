                This file courteously shared with KeelyNet through
                         the efforts of Mr. Brian Prothro.

          It is  a  direct  translation  from  German  to  English  of  the
          Testatika video tape generated by the European Methernitha group.
          The Testatika  is  a free energy  device  based  on  the  general
          principle of the Wimshurst generator.  Two counter rotating disks
          generate high  voltage  which  is  collected and  tapped  off  to
          provide energy  up  to 10KW depending on the physical size of the
          unit.

            This is the Testavistatika, an  apparatus,  with whose help so-
       called "free energy"  can be made usable.  The Testavistatika  is  a
       development of the spiritual union Meterneta, established in 1960 in
       Linden as a  cooperative  society under this name.  A department for
       research, development and electronics within Meterneta has concerned
       itself since its inception with the  problem  of alternative energy.
       This refers to  making the power of nature available  and  unlocking
       energy sources with  suitable  technologies for the greatest benefit
       of mankind without negatively affecting  the  ecological  balance of
       nature in any  way,  for  technology should serve people,  which  it
       cannot do if it is negatively disposed towards nature.

            The research    group   within   Meterneta   works   completely
       autonomously and is  financed with  the  cooperative  society's  own
       resources, without any outside assistance.

            The most efficient use of wind energy possible was the first
       partial goal in the research program of Meterneta.

            Here generators with quick stimulation were developed,  so that
       even lower rotation  speeds  in  connection  with  weak air movement
       charge up the storage battery cells.

            The utilization of energy from  flowing  water  also  kept  the
       research group busy, although more as a hobby.  The main matter here
       was to translate the lower rotation speeds of the water driven wheel
       with as little  loss  of  energy  as  possible  so   far   that  the
       generator's excitation threshold could be exceeded.

            Solar cells  and  solar  collectors  have occupied our research
       group for a long time now.  Nevertheless, superlative work is being
       accomplished in this area from many sides, so that Meterneta has
       concentrated the main effort of its entire research program on the
       utilization of less known (or even unknown) energy sources for over
       twenty years now.   The  result   of   this  research  work  is  the
       Testatika, of which you all will have heard already.

            How does it come to be that Meterneta as a private organization
       is investing so  much  time,  interest,  perseverance,  as  well  as
       financial resources, in  its research?  Research and development are
       integrated constituents of Meterneta's  ideal  fixing  of goals.  In
       order to make  these ideal goals comprehensible, we  would  like  to
       briefly introduce the  spiritual  union  of  Meterneta as a group of
       people living and working together.   Linden  is  a peaceful farming
       community, of which there are dozens in the region of Emmental.  Yet
       a life-style capable of filling more and more people  worldwide with
       enthusiasm and which   continues   to   astonish  by  means  of  its
       functional ability in extremely difficult situations is at home here
       in Linden.

            The genesis of Meterneta is also  to a large extent the history
       of Paul Baumann.  By means of his extraordinary technical abilities,
       as well as his surprising practical wisdom, he acquired  connections
       in every direction  to  people  with  ideals,  and  soon the idea to
       establish a self-help organization took form.

            Like-minded people joined together  in  the  name  of  God  the
       Almighty and founded a cooperative society, which  was  supposed  to
       lay down the spiritual union's basis for existence.  We wish to be a
       united people of  brothers to be divided in no difficulty or danger.
       This is what the solemn pledge says.

            The prerequisites  to  be included  were  the  renunciation  of
       alcohol and nicotine and the will, according to the example of early
       Christian principles, to realize a harmonious community life without
       strife and discord.  Meterneta is the ideal possibility  for members
       to realize a  life  characterized by an active love for one's fellow
       man.

            A workshop building was erected.   One building after the other
       grew up quickly.  The construction was accomplished  by  Meterneta's
       own labor and jointly gained resources.  Meterneta is an undertaking
       with several commercial  operations  and  real-estate worth millions
       today.

            The people who work here are  almost  without exception members
       of Meterneta.  This  blossoming economic development,  however,  was
       never capable of  impairing or even suppressing its ideal setting of
       goals from above.  On the contrary,  all  work together in their own
       interest with diligence and joy in building up and maintaining their
       home, according to the axiom:  "One for all and all  for  one".  One
       can surmount everything  with  this word and the old truths reappear
       and become important again.

            The people here feel like the members of a large family, like a
       community sharing the  same destiny,  as  well  as  proud  and  also
       thankful owners of their own beautiful home, which they are allowed


                                      Page 2





       to fashion in  any way they desire.  It is evident that this form of
       human communal living based on ideals can exist.

            How can the realization of a serious religious concept of life
       reconcile itself harmoniously with  successful  economic management?
       This is not  obvious,  to  be  sure.   Many  people  see  themselves
       confronted with this  genuine  problem  in  their  tight  social and
       economic entanglements and drive for material goods.

            A member of Meterneta's board of directors made the following
       comment in response to this very matter:

           "For me the most surprising thing, which this life-style
            generates, is that the essential  things function automatically
            among us, solely because of our inner conviction  that each one
            cares for  and  is  there  for  the  other.  It is something to
            marvel at."

            And a wonder within Meterneta is also the Testatika, the result
       of over twenty years of research and the secret of all secrets.  You
       see here the members of the research group who have participated in
       its development.  Paul  Baumann,   who   contributed  much  to  this
       invention with his   advanced   abilities   and  his   above-average
       knowledge concerning the  workings  of  the  laws  of nature and his
       extraordinarily fine perception,  also  belongs  in this group.  The
       miracle was lying  in wait within nature.  Nature  is  the  greatest
       force and source of knowledge for mankind and it still conceals many
       secrets today, which  it  surrenders  up only to those, who approach
       and link themselves to it with the  greatest  respect  and  sense of
       responsibility.

            In order to understand nature and to perceive her voice, man is
       directed to quiet and solitude.  And the knowledge required for this
       technology was created there.

            For this reason it has always been a great desire  of Meterneta
       to own sites close to nature in the valley, in the forest and on the
       lake, in order  to  explore  nature  itself  and  the Creator of All
       undisturbed in tranquility and concentration.   This was never quite
       accurately understood by the public.  It was falsely  interpreted as
       seclusion, i.e.  that  we  had something shady to hide.  Yes, it was
       even begrudged us, so that we always  had  the greatest trouble (and
       still do today)  to  be  able to realize in an undisturbed  way  all
       that, which we have undertaken for ourselves.

            What we  learn  in  and from nature is of the greatest use, not
       only for ourselves,  but  also  for   everyone,  because  everything
       positive continues to have an effect on the basis of its inner laws.
       Such research and development work requires a considerable financial
       outlay.  For this  reason  we  have often had to make  do  with  the
       simplest technical resources.

            We collect  those  things  which  the society of prosperity has
       thrown away, and we are establishing  a  corner-stone for new forces
       and truths.  We have been permitted to have the experience  that the
       finest and most  colossal results can be reached especially with the
       simplest means.  We have never demanded  any foreign financial help,
       for we want to remain free Swiss citizens and to not allow ourselves
       to be hindered or even constrained in the realization of our goals.

            Both disks  [2],  which rotate in opposite directions, generate
       an electrostatic charge.  This one disk represents the earth and the
       other represents the  cloud.   The  charge  is  retained  with  grid
       electrodes.  The charge is then collected and regulated contact free
       by the so-called keys.

            The disks  run on their own after an initial  turning  by  hand
       according to the electrostatic laws of repulsion and attraction.  A
       rectifying diode holds  them  in  tact,  because the impulses of the
       forces of attraction and repulsion  change  and the disks would then
       turn faster and  faster.   The  correct  rotation   speed   is  very
       important and the  disks  must turn quite slowly and undisturbed for
       optimal current generation.

            Energy is  stored in the grid  condensers  and  then  uniformly
       released, after which the high voltage is reduced through additional
       equipment and the wattage [3] is simultaneously built up.

            The machine  releases a continuous direct current,  the  output
       capacity of which  is  dependent  on  the  size  of the model.  This
       machine produces a continuous output  of  three  to  four kilowatts,
       depending on air  humidity,  whereby the voltage fluctuates  between
       270 and 320 volts.

            High air humidity prevents the building up of the voltage.  Dry
       air is the  best.  To be sure, a main goal has been reached with the
       already accomplished results.  Free  energy can be made usable.  Yet
       our research projects continue.  Much more work and  time are needed
       until a model is developed, which can be handed over to laymen, i.e.
       everyone, without any danger.

            Much of  this  must  appear  impossible  (even  crazy)  to  the
       educated physicist.  He may not take  exception  to  the concepts we
       have employed to  explain  the  entire project.  We  have  partially
       drawn upon concepts of traditional physical terminology, in order to
       be able to  explain  and  define more closely the manner of function
       and the characteristics of the individual  machine  parts.  However,
       new concepts must  actually be created, as we have already  employed
       one concept, in   that   we   designated   the  contact-less  charge
       collection through grid electrodes as a keying device.

            This machine presents a difficult test for those who have been
       educated in traditional physics,  for  its  mode of operation is not
       explainable (or is at least only partially explainable) by means of
       physical knowledge that has been known and recognized up to today.


            Yet an  educated  expert  should  also remain  free  and  think
       independently, and he  should  not  allow  himself to be limited and
       restricted within the   contemporary    constrained   framework   of
       recognized specialty knowledge.    It  is  to  be  considered   that
       established science has often already found it necessary to amend or
       even give up some of its fundamental theses.

            Let us think about Galileo, to name only one example.  This man
       was nearly burned at the stake as a socerer and magician by society,
       only because a   truth   he  investigated  and  recognized  was  not
       acceptable to the  educational wisdom  at  that  time.   Educational
       teachings are not wrong, but they are incomplete, and for that

                                      Page 4





       reason there is  the  possibility  of drawing false conclusions.  We
       are standing in a new age that brings to light new realizations.

            The clothing of present day science  has  become too tight, and
       it should, as an insect larva, slip off its too tight  skin, so that
       its metamorphosis can  run  its  course.  It should stand one day at
       the boundary (and with it the goal)  of current earthly knowledge as
       a radiantly beautiful  mature  winged  creature,   a  universal  and
       boundless spiritual science,  which  will  bless  and  fill  renewed
       mankind with happiness.

            A universal development of man  is,  however, also necessary to
       that end.  This is only possible, if man again learns  to  recognize
       his place in creation (and with it his duty), for all of creation is
       in a strict  and  tightly joined order, active according to the will
       and word of the Creator.  Thus, man  should  also learn to recognize
       and realize the laws valid for him within all of creation;  but  the
       hard facts show  us  much more how far man has abstinately and self-
       grandizingly departed out of this  divine  order.   With this he has
       become the actual originator of all chaos and evil  on  this planet.
       And the authorities,  who would be responsible for the well-being of
       mankind, work all too often only  towards  the  goal  of  making the
       lives of men  to  an increasing degree difficult and  rendering  any
       free spiritual development impossible.

            Advances in   science   and   technology   are  carelessly  and
       irresponsibly misused for the purposes of destruction and killing,
       instead of for building up and maintaining  life, and these advances
       are becoming the  curse  of  mankind.   A  new  technology   is  not
       sufficient to change  this  situation, no matter how environmentally
       conscious or ingenious it may be.  In order to change this, one must
       seize the evil at its root, which lies in the disposition of man.


            The ancient commandments of God  still  show mankind the way to
       this goal today, for the Prophet Micah says:

           "He has showed you, O man, what is good.  And what does the
            Lord required of you?  To act justly and to love  mercy  and to
            walk humbly with your God." <Mic 6:8, NIV>
