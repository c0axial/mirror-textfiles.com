                                Alternative Energy?
                     What about "those little green granules"?
                                   by Jimmy Ward

       On July 13, 1979, the story of Guido Franch and his "Mota-Fuel" made
       the papers nationwide.  He claimed  he could turn ordinary tap water
       into 105 octane gasoline by merely adding some green crystals to it.
       With a gasoline  shortage  in full swing, his announcement  was  met
       with a great deal of interest.

       Franch, 69, of  Villa  Park, Illinois, had been subpoenaed to appear
       in Federal Court with records "relating to the purchase of any fuel,
       fuel powder, or fuel formula in  (his)  possession  or  under  (his)
       control" since 1968.

       Franch did not  claim  credit  for discovering the mysterious  fuel,
       only for converting  the  formula for use as a motor fuel.  The real
       inventor, he claimed, was Alexander  Craft,  a  german scientist who
       died in 1941.   Kraft  was a rocket fuel expert involved  in  "doing
       research way ahead of his time."

       Franch claimed he  could make one pound of granules out of 25 pounds
       of coal and that it cost him about $100 to make a pound of granules,
       but mass production would drive the cost down to about $4.00 a pound
       or about 8 cents per gallon of gasoline.

       He was later charged, tried and convicted  of  bilking large sums of
       money from his investors who were never allowed to  see  how he made
       his granules or  even  how  he  converted water to "gasoline".  They
       were given containers filled with  a  greenish  liquid  that smelled
       like cleaning fluid  instead.   It  did  burn and even  power  cars,
       however.

       Was he only  a  con artist, or did he really convert water to fuel -
       or both?  It  is interesting to note  that  during  the  trial,  the
       matter of whether  he  actually could or couldn't convert  water  to
       fuel was hardly  mentioned.  More curiously, the allegation that his
       "Mota-Fuel" was a hoax was NEVER mentioned.   In  fact, there was no
       mention of any hoax at all, only that he had "stolen" money from his
       investors.  Does this mean "Mota-Fuel" was real?   And  that  it was
       made from coal-derived granules?

       Actually, this is  not the first time those green granules made from
       coal have turned up.  In the Cincinnati Enquirer for April 25, 1897,
       an aeroship (see Aero files in the Gravity section of KeelyNet), was
       reported to have landed, tha occupants  of which claimed their craft
       used a "volatile  substance"  that  somehow  NEGATED  THE  FORCE  OF
       GRAVITY.  C.A.A. Dellschau died in 1924 leaving behind several books
       of drawings of  strange  looking  airships allegedly designed in the
       mid-1800s which used a gas that negated  gravity  in  order  to fly.
       The gas was  made  by  adding  green  crystals  to  ordinary  water.
       Coincidence?  These crystals were made from coal too.

       Even more bizarre  is the story of one Dr. Rhinelander (apparently a
       pseudonym) who allegedly was contacted  by  aliens toward the end of
       the century.  They  supposedly  gave him plans to  build  an  aerial
       craft which would  operate on a propulsion principle totally unknown
       to him.  He was instructed to collect  scientists  and  migrate to a
       coal mining area  of  the MidWest.  The nearby coal  mines  were  to
       supply the basic ingredients for a new fuel which could be made from
       ordinary water.  Those green granules again!

       More "down to earth" is the story of John Andrews.  In 1917, he used
       a green powder   to   convert  sea  water  to  gasoline  before  the
       astonished eyes of several US Navy brass.  Even though it was tested
       in the tank of a motorboat and proved  more  than  satisfactory, the
       Navy was "not interested".  In fact, he seems to have been unable to
       find anyone who  was  interested!  In 1935, he converted  tap  water
       into fuel before  members  of  the  Bureau  of  Standards and gave a
       demonstration of its power, but they too declined to take action.

       There are other stories of other inventors  who  appear to have been
       able to transform water into something resembling gasoling.   All of
       them have the  same  basic elements :  green granules or powder MADE
       FROM COAL.  Demonstrations are given,  often  before  such people as
       Earl Eisenhower (brother of the president), or large  companies such
       as Ford Motor  Co.  or Standard Oil.  Typically the alleged inventor
       never takes full credit for his discovery  and  declines  to divulge
       the secret process for creating the mysterious granules.

       Fact or fiction?  FOCUS doesn't know either.
