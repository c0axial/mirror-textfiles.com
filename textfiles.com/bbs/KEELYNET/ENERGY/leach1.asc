           The following I received from Chris Tinsley (compuserve)

Back on the original topic (Sam Leach's over unity plasma steam device) have
you found any info on this?  Something ominous is brewing here in Canada.  The
company that bought this thing from Leach is speaking of an imminent news
release or conference at the end of this month where they will demonstrate the
production prototype that they paid 130k$ for.  I spoke with the company pres.
and she seems to be excited on the border of fear for what this thing is going
to do.  She claims there will be no question about the validity of the device
after their release.

This Leach guy seems to have a pretty good record according to her.  He held a
patent on the original 3d process for movies and did quite well when he sold
it to Eastman. He's no spring chicken apparently and just wants to see this
invention in the hands of someone who will run with it.

Apparently, they are real concerned about Mr. Leach's safety.  He's under 24
hour guard.  This is starting to sound like a B-movie!  I'll try to keep you
posted as this thing develops.

I have not even had a chance to investigate. You seem to have learned a lot.
If you communicate with these people, let me make a suggestion. Based upon
what I have seen and heard, talking to the leading people in this field, the
cost of the bodyguards is money well spent. It may sound like a B grade movie
and pure paranoia, but I think it is a darn good idea.  I am sure they have
their reasons and suspicions and I expect those suspicions are justified.

Subj:  LOOSE END
Chris,

Sorry to pester you again, but here's another "loose end" to ponder in the
following message forwarded from the sci.physics newsgroup.

That's ok...at least your flame is polite :-)

 production?

No part of the patent information infers any sort of excess energy or unusual
phenomenon at all.  However, the Canadian rights were recently acquired by a
group in Vancouver, and they are listed on the TSE.  There was a brief blurb
in the Globe and Mail recently, and they mentioned things like "closed loop
operation ...no fossil fuel required...only uses small amounts of water"  The
only phrase they didn't use was "perpetual motion"  They also said that
investors are not responding, which really comes as no surprise considering
the rather incredible claim.

> A tremendous amount of energy is poured into the plasma by the electric arc.
  This dissociates the molecules and ionizes the atoms.  When the atoms
  restablize and the molecules recombine, that energy is returned as heat and
  light. The presence of water vapor or liquid in this formulation changes
  nothing as far as I can see.  I'm not sure what determines the "temperature"
  of the arc, but as long as an arc persists, the process that I described
  goes on.
> The presence of an "electrolyte" in the water is completely irrelevant, as
  an electrolyte is of interest only in the context of electrical conduction
  in a water solution, and I realize that, and I'm sure that's why he adds the
  electrolye.  The arc he talks about is over 7 inches [long] and the voltages
  are only in the 2kV range, so he would need something to encourage
  conduction.

> has no effect in a plasma, where any liquid water is quickly vaporized (and
  dissociated and ionized).
> So again, my question is: why do you think something unusual is happening
  here?> >Dave>

The only reason why I would even consider the possibility of something unusual
here stems from something I recall Harold Puthoff (see the thread on amazing
lightness in this conference) once suggested tapping energy from the vacuum
(30 seconds allowed for laughter to subside).  He suggested that devices
employing cold plasma streams might exhibit vacuum energy effects, via the
"Casimir pinch" effect.  I don't believe this inventor is making any ZPE
claims, but I couldn't help but notice the coincidence.  So now I am just
fishing for any info on this inventor, to see if any similar
claims/suggestions have surfaced down south.

....
The developing story on the Leach device here in Canada is interesting, since
this is a company with public stock offerings, and some respectable papers
have covered it, although interestingly (and undertandably) the market is not
responding.  These are still penny stocks...likely the biggest bargain of the
century if they can deliver.  I spoke with the company CEO and they seem
entirely serious and confident in the technology, although they can't
understand Leach's explanations.  I asked them if Leach ever mentioned ZPE or
vacuum energy, but they have never even heard the term.

I picked up a copy of his patent. He was careful not to say anything relating
to OU energy production in the claims. Interestingly, it is a plasma device,
utilizing water injection which breaks down in the electric arc, so the plasma
is a soup of hydrogen, oxygen and free electrons. I will be following the
development of the Leach device very closely and keep you posted.
