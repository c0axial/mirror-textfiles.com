                                  Sam Leach's Box

       "It's the greatest  thing  since  sex,"  proclaims Patrick McDonald,
       vice president of MJM Hydrotech of  Los  Angeles.  "There will be no
       reason to strip-mine for coal, no reason to run supertankers full of
       oil or build nuclear-power plants."

       The object of McDonald's enthusiasm is a mysterious  stainless-steel
       case, about the  size  of  a  steamer trunk, equipped on the outside
       with six dials and a gas jet.

       It was developed by an equally mysterious  61-year-old  Los  Angeles
       inventor named Sam  Leach, who claims it will do nothing  less  than
       produce combustible hydrogen  from tap water - without any continous
       source of outside energy.

       If Leach is telling the truth, his  hydrogen generator would satisfy
       a dream that scientists have had for decades; an unlimited supply of
       clean energy for homes, autos and industry at practically no cost.

       If he's not telling the truth, it could be the biggest business scam
       since hundreds were  bilked by the promoter of the nonexistent  Dale
       automobile.

       Leach says his device is really quite simple.  Inside the case is an
       UNIDENTIFIED REACTANT METAL.   Tap water is fed into the case and an
       electric charge is applied, turning the water to steam.

       The reactant metal SOAKS UP THE OXYGEN in the steam and the hydrogen
       THUS RELEASED is sucked out of the chamber by a vacuum device.

       Leach says the device needs a small charge of outside power to begin

                                      Page 1





       the conversion process,  but  that  after  that  it powers itself by
       using the heat produced by the chemical reaction.

       Unlikely as all this sounds, Leach  has  some  believers.  Morris J.
       Mirkin, the founder  and  former head of Budget Rent-A-Car  and  now
       chairman of MJM,  and  Randall Presley, president of Presley Cos., a
       California group of home construction  firms,  have  each paid Leach
       $500,000 for "automotive"  and  "residential  application   rights,"
       respectively, to the generator.

       When rumors of  the  device  began  to  circulate,  the stock in the
       Presley Cos. shot from $4.24 a share last December 23rd to $20.25 on
       March 25th.

       At that point,  the  Securities  and   Exchange  Commission  stopped
       trading in Presley  stock  and  launched an investigation  into  the
       possibility of stock manipulation and other violations of securities
       laws.

       Leach commissioned two reputable laboratories to test the generator.
       In press releases  prepared  by  MJM, both were quoted as saying the
       machine worked.  But the testing laboratories  themselves  refuse to
       talk to reporters, saying they promised Leach they would not.

       Skeptics : Leach  also  is not available to reporters,  and  he  has
       little support among  scientists.   Most experts say his description
       of the process violates two laws of thermodynamics.

       "It's ridiculous," snapped a hydrogen  expert from UCLA.  "It sounds
       like a perpetual-motion machine."

       And so far, the U.S. Energy Research and Development  Administration
       also is unimpressed.   "It's possible to produce hydrogen that way,"
       one top ERDA scientist said, "but  we  don't  know what's in his box
       and he won't tell anybody.  If I had to make a guess,  I'd say it is
       a gimmick."

       Whether is is  indeed a gimmick or for real will presumably be known
       when the SEC completes its investigation  -  or  when  one of the 86
       patents Leach HAS BEEN ISSUED in countries around the  world is made
       public.  That may happen early next month.

       In the meantime, the Southern California Gas Co. of Los Angeles, one
       of the firms  approached to use the Leach device to generate gas, is
       keeping an open mind.

       "It seems a little unusual, but [physical]  laws have been broken in
       the past," says Southern vice president Ray Todd.

       But then, Todd   is   willing   to   consider  some   unconventional
       propositions.  Not long  ago,  he was approached by an inventor with
       an idea for extracting methane gas - the chief ingredient in natural
       gas - from chicken droppings.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

                                 Perpetual Motion?

       Last March 28 in Los Angeles representatives of several laboratories
       and some reporters  watched  what  seemed to be ordinary water piped
       into a device somewhat LARGER THAN A BIG TRUNK.

       Knobs were turned and a JET OF FLAME  burst  forth  from  a tube and
       BURNED FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES, until the machine was turned off.

       Samuel Leach, the  61-year  old inventor, claims the  flame  results
       from BURNING GAS  GENERATED  BY  SPLITTING  WATER  into hydrogen and
       oxygen.  Except for the brief electrical  input  necessary  to start
       the process, says  Leach, it is self-sustaining and  derives  (heat)
       from the water itself.

       An inexpensive process  to  separate hydrogen and oxygen would solve
       the world's energy problems.

       For at least 60 years it has been  known that the REACTIONS OF METAL
       AND WATER WILL PRODUCE HYDROGEN.

       One early process  mixed  POWDERED  IRON  WITH STEAM.   The  Chicago
       Institute of Gas Technology has developed a HYDROGEN GENERATOR BASED
       ON CADMIUM.

       But Derek P.  Gregory  of  the Institute, who has led the push for a
       "hydrogen economy," states that NO  KNOWN  SYSTEM  will approach the
       claims made by Leach.

       "If it works  the  way  they  say  it does, it is perpetual  motion.
       That's impossible," SCIENCE NEWS quotes Gregory as saying.

       The apparatus inside  Leach's  CLOSED  STEEL  TRUNK  is  supposed to
       include TWO STEEL TANKS, each holding  GRANULES  of  an UNIDENTIFIED
       METAL that theoretically REACTS WITH STEAM, BINDING  THE  OXYGEN and
       RELEASING HYDROGEN.

       After the oxygen has been bound to the metal, Leach claims the metal
       can BE HEATED TO REMOVE THE OXYGEN AND THE CYCLE REPEATED (using the
       same metal).

       If it is  to  be self-sustaining, the heat given off by the hydrogen
       must be MORE THAN SUFFICIENT to remove the oxygen from the metal.

       The laws of thermodynamics say this is impossible.

       It's easy enough to produce hydrogen  but  some heat always would be
       lost in the process and outside energy would have to be added.

           The following article is from Fate - November 1976 - page 36
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

                                  Tunnel Vision?

       Science regards the  laws of thermodynamics as almost sacred.  A Mr.
       Leach insists that "thermodynamicists follow certain things BLINDLY,
       like TUNNEL VISION."

       Meanwhile investments made in a Leach  invention  by  several  large
       companies are at stake.  The stock of Presley, one  of the companies
       associated with the invention, has jumped from about $2.00 to $20.00
       and 3/8 on  the  American  Stock  Exchange,  and  the Securities and
       Exchange Commission has ordered an investigation.

       One thing seems  sure.   Although   two   laboratories,  Smith-Emery
       Company of Los   Angeles   and   the   Approved   Engineering   Test
       Laboratories of Encino, California, disassembled and reassembled the
       apparatus and say  they  COULD  FIND  NO  HIDDEN  SOURCE  OF ENERGY,
       definitive operating tests by dispassionate scientists have not been
       made.

       Repealing the laws  of  thermodynamics   seems   considerably   more
       difficult than amending the Constitution of the United  States.  But
       wouldn't it be wonderful if Sam Leach has done it.  -  Curtis Fuller

       Vangard notes...

             A picture  of  the  device  shows  the front panel to have two
             large meter type indicators,  3  small  pressure indicators, 1
             large pressure indicator, 3 protruding stops  which  could  be
             needle valve adjusters, and 5 knobs.

             A cutaway  shows  at  least  eleven drip bottles with a common
             input for  each row of bottles.   These  rows  are  apparently
             controlled by a single master needle valve adjustment per row.

             There must be three rows of these drip bottles,  each  row  of
             which can  be fed singly or in any combination and at any rate
             of water.  Apparently, this  water  then  drips  into the tank
             where it is electrified to generate steam.

             The steam is then broken down by the metal in  its  process of
             absorbing the oxygen.

             The device   sounds   simple  enough  and  has  many  possible
             arrangements to enhance the  effect.   At this time, we do not
             have copies of the patents which were said to have been issued
             in OTHER COUNTRIES.

             Those in a position to experiment with various metals might do
             well to check into this phenomena.

             A very  simple  test would be to use a metal  sample  under  a
             glass jar.   As steam was passed over the metal, the hydrogen,
             being a very light gas would  accumulate  in  the  top  of  an
             upside down jar.

             A flame  could then be introduced using a spark triggered from
             a safe distance to check for  ignition.   If the reactant is a
             metal and NOT AN ALLOY, it should be fairly easy  to locate it
             by trial and error using different metals.

             Again, if this inspires you to carry out an experiment in this
             area, we  would  really  appreciate you sharing it with us and
             the people interested in such projects.
