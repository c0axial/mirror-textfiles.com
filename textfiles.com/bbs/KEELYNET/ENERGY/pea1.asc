       B1-B,3    CARBURETION, MOORE
       The most productive in the field of carburetion was George Arlington
       Moore. Out of  17000  Patents,   250   of   them   were  related  to
       carburetion. As far  back as the mid 1920's, Moore  was  capable  of
       virtually elliminating carbon    monoxide    pollution    with   his
       carburetors.  People in the automotive  field considered Moore to be
       a genious and  couldn't  understand  why  the  automobile   industry
       ignored his inventions.

       B1-A,40   GENERATOR, FREE ENERGY, COLER, von UNRUH
       CLASSIFIED BRITISH INTELLIGENC REPORT:  A  German  researcher by the
       name of Hans Coler, was visited and interogated about his "Magneto-
       tromapparat" FREE ENERGY  generator.  The inventor  claimed  to  get
       electrical energy without the use of a chemical or mechanical source
       of power.  This  device  consisted of only permanent magnets, copper
       coils, and condensers in a static  arrangement  and delivered 450 mv
       for a period  of some hours. Coler also claimed his  "Stromerzouger"
       could deliver 6  kw  of  power from the few watts delivered by a dry
       cell.

       J3-C,43   FLYING SAUCER, T. BROWN
       Townsend Brown constructed Flying  condensers shaped like Saucers. A
       high positive charge  on  the  leading  edge  caused  thrust  to  be
       generated in the  direction  of the region of low flux density.  His
       Saucers required no jets or propellers, no moving parts at all. They
       modified the gravity field arround themselves to produce, in effect,
       the incline of a "hill" under the craft, which they slid down like a
       surfboard on a wave.

       The Fish/Kendig Variable   Venturi   carburetors   get   some   very
       interesting mileage figures.  The  Fish  carburetor  even  got  into
       production on a  small  scale,  but  for  some unknown reason, these
       carburetors fade away in the early 1960's.

       J1-A,26   CARBURETION, POGUE
       CARS Magazine states  that in the  opening  months  of  1936,  Pogue
       panicked the Toronto stock exchange and threw fright  into the major
       oil companies. Stock  exchange  offices  & brokers were swamped with
       orders to dump all oil stock immediately.  This  same article states
       that Winnipeg's largest   automobile   dealers  tested   the   POGUE
       carburetor and got results of up to 216.8 mpg!

       The OTC-X1 didn't fly for several reason today: Mr.  Carr was in the
       hospital for eight   days   with   lung   hemorrhage.  There  is  no
       indications of cancer,  TB or other  lung  ailments.  Also,  in  the
       preliminary pre-flight test the accumulator developed  a  leak which
       sprayed mercury all  over  the  inside mechanism.  "We don't plan to
       announce the next pre-flight test  in  advance",  said  Mr. Wayne S.

       Aho announces plans to take the OTC-X1 to the moon at 12:01 a.m. on
       Dec. 7, 1959. He will get there in  5 hours and orbit it for 7 days,
       then he will return to earth. The Carr space ship is 45 ft. in diam.
       and weighs 30  tons  and  is powered by electricity.  Maj.  Aho  was
       formerely an Army  Intelligence  Officer who says he landed on Omaha
       Beach in Europe on D-Day and won  the  Bronze  Star and Purple Heart
       for wounds received in the Battle of the Bulge. He  claims  to  have

       Otis T. Carr told an "open house" audience of 300 people on Memorial
       Day that it is a "treacherous misstatement  of  fact to say or infer
       that we (OTC Enterprises) are coming to California to raise money in
       stock sales". Carr appeared to be planning to sell  rights to build,
       sell or operate   the  OTC-X1  Flying  Saucer  he  claims  he'll  be
       producing at the  former  Osbrink   Plant.   Thus  Carr  would't  be
       violating a feferal  injunction  secured  by  the   U.S.  Securities

       He was using  the  KENDIG  Variable  Venturi carburetor that a small
       company (name unknown), manufactured in Los Angeles for racing cars.
       Within a week the student was told to remove the carburetor since it
       wasn't approved by  the  Air Resources  Board  (ARB).  His  car  had
       reduced pollution and doubled the gas mileage (for that model).

       B1-B,6    GAS/WATER ADDITIVE
       John Andrews, a  Portugese chemist,  demonstrated  a  water  to  gas
       additive before Navy officials which allowed ordinary  water  to  be
       added to gasoline  without  decreasing the combustability of the gas
       and would drive the cost of gasoline  down  to  2  cents per gallon.
       When Navy officials  finally  went to his lab to negotiate  for  the
       formula, they found Andrews missing and his lab ransacked.

       Edwin V. Gray, of Evgray Enterprises,  Van  Nuys,  CA, gets a Patent
       for a FREE ENERGY automobile engine. The engine starts  off  of  two
       car batteries and once it gets going, it recharges the batteries and
       powers the car. Unfortunately, Evgray Ent. has become embroiled in a
       controversy with the  Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which is
       unrelated to the engine itself but has halted the development of the
       engine.

       J2-F, J3-F,48
       Joseph C. Yater  invents  an Heat-to-Electricity convertor  that  he
       says will cost  the  consumer  approx.  $200  and would be up to 90%
       efficient. The device operates by  capturing  "fluctuation  voltage"
       (static noise heard  on radios and amplifiers). The  rooftop  device
       would be heated  by the sun and use millions of microcircuits to tap
       the freed electrons from heated molecules.  Yater took his device to
       the Government, which declared that his device had "real potential".
       After being promised a working model within 6 months  by the Gov't.,
       they came back  to  him  with  the  reply  that  the device would be
       impractical.

       A man-made standing columnar ELF  wave  collapsed  at  Bell  Island,
       Newfoundland, Canada, today. This conclusion was  reached  after  an
       analysis done by  the  Dept.  of  Geology  at Memorial University of
       Newfoundland and with senior officials  of Newfoundland and Labrador
       Hydro.  Affects of  this  wave  collapse  were:  Power   lines  were
       vaporized. A power  surge  was  reported.   A  voltage regulator was
       fused. All fuses leading to the local  power  company's  transformer
       melted, yet the  transformer escaped unscathed. Ball  lightning  was
       seen, rumbling and humming below 60 hz was felt and heard.

       U.S. Government Agency  Restricts  CB  Radio  &  Telephone   Privacy
       device: Four inventors,  Carl Kicolai, William Raike, Carl Quale and
       David Miller of  Seattle,  WA,  developed   a   device   to  prevent
       eavesdropping on CB   radio   and   telephone   transmissions    for
       nonmilitary, nongovernment use. The NSA was quick to issue a secrecy
       order against them. This means they may not talk about the invention
       in any detail  without  risking a jail term!  The order was received
       six months after  a  patent  was   filed   for  the  device.   "Your
       application...has been found to contain subject matter, the
       unauthorized disclosure of  which might be detrimental  to  national
       security," wrote the  Patent  Office.  (This appears to be part of a
       general plan to limit the privacy of the American people.)

       Science and Mechanics magazine interview  regarding the JOHNSON FREE
       ENERGY motor: When asked if he (Johnson) thought  that  the  load on
       his motor might  drain  the  magnetic  spin  (of  the  electrons) he
       replied, "I didn't start the electron  spins and I don't know anyway
       to stop them - do you?" The Johnson Permanent Motor  is  one  of the
       most promising possibilities  in  the  world of "Free Energy". It is
       simple to construct and yields high output.
