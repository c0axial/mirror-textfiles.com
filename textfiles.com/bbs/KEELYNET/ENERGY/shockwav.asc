       Collisionless Shock Waves

       Shock waves resonate   through  the  solar  system,  much  like  the
       reverberating boom from a supersonic jet.  In the latter case, the
       disturbance is caused by an aerodynamic  shock,  an abrupt change in
       gas properties that propagates faster than the speed  of  sound.  It
       had long been recognized that in a neutral gas, such as the earth's
       atmosphere, particles must collide if shocks are to form.

       Beginning in the  1950s,  we  and  our  colleagues  theorized  that,
       contrary to the expectations of many scientists, similar shock waves
       could form even in the near vacuum  of  outer  space, where particle
       collisions are extremely  rare.   If  so,  shocks   could   play   a
       significant role in shaping space environments.

       "Collisionless" shocks cannot occur naturally on the earth, because
       nearly all matter  here  consists  of electrically neutral atoms and
       molecules.  In space, however, high  temperatures  and  ultra-violet
       radiation from hot  stars  decompose  atoms  into their  constituent
       nuclei and electrons,  producing  a  soup  of  electrically  charged
       particles known as a plasma.  Plasma  physicists  proposed  that the
       collective electrical and  magnetic  properties  of   plasmas  could
       produce interactions that  take  the  place of collisions and permit
       shocks to form.

       In 1964 the   theoretical  work   found   its   first   experimental
       confirmation.  Norman F.  Ness  and his colleagues  at  the  Goddard
       Space Flight Center, using data collected from the IMP-1 spacecraft,
       detected clear signs  that  a  collisionless  shock exists where the
       solar wind encounters the earth's  magnetic  field.   (Solar wind is
       the continuous flow of charged particles outward from the sun.)

       More recent research  has  demonstrated  that  collisionless  shocks
       appear in a  dazzling  array of astronomical settings.  For example,
       shocks have been found in the solar  wind  upstream (sunward) of all
       the planets and  comets  that  have  been  visited   by  spacecraft.
       Violent flares on  the sun generate shocks that propagate to the far
       reaches of the solar system; tremendous  galactic  outbursts  create
       disruptions in the intergalactic medium that are trillions of times

       larger.  In addition,  many  astrophysicists  think that shocks from
       supernova explosions in our galaxy  accelerate  cosmic rays, a class
       of extraordinarily energetic elementary particles and  atomic nuclei
       that rain down on the earth from all directions.

       The study of plasmas began in the 19th century, when Michael Faraday
       investigated electrical discharges  through  gases.   Modern  plasma
       research dates from  1957  and 1958.   During  those  years,  Soviet
       Sputnik and American Explorer spacecrafts discovered that space near
       the earth is filled with plasma.  At the same time, till then secret
       research on controlled thermonuclear fusion conducted  by  the U.S.,
       Soviet Union and   Europe  was  revealed  at  the  Atoms  for  Peace
       Conference in Geneva,  greatly  increasing   the   freely  available
       information on plasmas.

       Fusion research focuses  on  producing  extremely  hot  plasmas  and
       confining them in  magnetic  "bottles,"  to  create  the  conditions
       necessary for energy-producing nuclear reactions to occur.  In 1957,
       while searching for a method to  heat  fusion  plasmas,  one  of  us
       (Sagdeev) realized that an instantaneous magnetic compression could
       propagate through a  collisionless  plasma, much as  a  shock  moves
       through an ordinary fluid.

       Magnetic fields that   thread   through  plasmas  make  them  behave
       somewhat like such a fluid.  A magnetic  field  exerts  a force (the
       Lorentz force) on a moving electrically charged particle.  The field
       can be thought of as a series of magnetic lines through  the plasma,
       like the field  lines  around  a bar magnet that can be made visible
       with iron filings.

       The Lorentz force always acts perpendicular both to the direction of
       the magnetic field line and to the  direction in which a particle is
       moving.  If the particle moves perpendicular to the field, the force
       acts like a rubber band, pulling the particle back  and constraining
       it to move  in  small  circles  about  the magnetic field line.  The
       particle can, however, move freely  in the direction of the magnetic
       field line.  The   combination   of  the  free  motion   along   and
       constrained, circular rotation across the magnetic field shapes the
       particle's trajectory into  a  helix  that  winds  around a magnetic
       field line.

       The Lorentz force makes it difficult to disperse the plasma in the
       direction perpendicular to the magnetic field.  The maximum distance
       over which particles can move away from the field, called the Larmor
       radius, is inversely proportional  to  the  field  strength.  In the
       weak interplanetary magnetic  field,  the Larmor radius  amounts  to
       several kilometers for  electrons and several hundred kilometers for
       more massive ions.  These distances  may  seem  large,  but they are
       tiny compared with  the  size  of the region where  the  solar  wind
       encounters the earth's magnetic field.

       The shock that  forms  there,  called  a  bow  shock,  has  the same
       parabolic shape as the waves that  pile up ahead of a speedboat.  It
       stretches more than 100,000 kilometers across.  When  the  scale  is
       larger than the  Larmor  radius  for  ions, the collective motion of
       plasma particles across the magnetic  field actually drags the field
       lines along with it.  The magnetic field thus becomes  "frozen" into
       the plasma.

       In short, a magnetic field endows collisionless plasmas with elastic
       properties analogous to those of a dense gas, and so a plasma wave
       crossing a magnetic field behaves somewhat like an ordinary sound
       wave.  The theoretical analysis of collisionless shocks therefore
       started by following the ideas developed from earlier research on
       aerodynamic shocks.

       Suppose, for example, a sudden compression creates a sound wave in
       air.  As the  wave  travels,  its  shape--that  is,  its  profile of
       pressure and density--changes.  Because  the most compressed regions
       of the wave  move  the  fastest,  the  wave grows stronger  and  its
       leading edge becomes   sharper.    The  great  German  mathematician
       Bernhard Riemann showed how this phenomenon, called wave steepening,
       creates shock waves.

       Ultimately the faster-moving denser  air  behind catches up with the
       slower air ahead.   At this point, the sound wave  behaves  somewhat
       like an ocean  wave  heading  toward  shore.  A water wave steepens,
       overturns and then crashes into foam.

       A sound wave reaches an analogous but different climax.  As the wave
       grows so steep  that  it  is  about   to  overturn,  individual  gas
       molecules become important   in   transporting   momentum    between
       neighboring points in  the  gas:  molecules  from the faster, denser
       region of the  wave  rush  ahead   of  the  steepening  wave  front,
       colliding with molecules in the slower region ahead  of the wave and
       exchanging momentum with  them.   In  this way, the slower molecules
       are brought up to the speed of the moving wave.

       This exchange of momentum is caused by molecular viscosity.  In this
       process, momentum is  passed from  the  overtaking  wave  crest  and
       imparted to the undisturbed region ahead of it, much  as  in a relay
       race a baton  is  passed  from  one  runner  to the next.  Molecular
       viscosity becomes highly efficient  when  the  thickness of the wave
       front shrinks to  the  average distance that a particle  can  travel
       before it collides  with  another, a distance known as the collision
       mean free path.  (The mean free path  of  a molecule in air is about
       one ten-thousandth of  a  centimeter  long.)   At   this  thickness,
       steepening and viscosity balance each other, and a steady shock wave
       forms.  The resulting  shock represents an almost steplike change in
       gas velocity, density and pressure.

       Before physicists knew of a mechanism that could replace molecular
       viscosity in plasmas, it made little  sense  for  them  to  talk  of
       collisionless shocks.  Consequently,  the topic lay  fairly  dormant
       for many years.  Then, in the late 1950s, one of us (Sagdeev) and,
       independently, Arthur R.  Kantrowitz  and Harry E. Petschek, then at
       the Avco-Everett Research Laboratory  near  Boston, suggested that a
       similar sort of momentum relay race could take place  in  a  tenuous
       plasma.  They theorized   that   in  a  plasma,  waves  rather  than
       individual particles pass along the baton.

       The plasma relay race depends on the fact that the speed of a plasma
       wave changes with wavelength, an effect called dispersion.  Indeed,
       whereas in ordinary gases the speed of a sound wave is practically
       independent of wavelength, in collisionless plasma a wave is very
       dispersive.  That is, its speed may  either  increase or decrease as
       its wavelength shortens,   depending  on  the  angle   between   the
       direction of propagation of the wave and orientation of the magnetic
       field.
                                      Page 3





       According to Fourier's    theorem,    a   fundamental   theorem   of
       mathematics, any wave profile consists  of  many superimposed waves,
       or harmonics, of different wavelengths.  (By analogy, white light is
       composed of many  distinct colors, each of a different  wavelength.)
       If the wave  profile  steepens, it excites harmonics of ever shorter
       wavelength.

       For wave propagation  that  is  not  exactly  perpendicular  to  the
       magnetic field, dispersion  causes shorter-wavelength  harmonics  to
       travel faster than  the longer-wavelength ones (negative disperson).
       The effects of dispersion become significant when a steepening shock
       front becomes about as thin as the Larmor radius for ions.

       At this point, the shorter-wavelength  harmonics  race  ahead of the
       front into the undisturbed plasma upstream.  These  harmonics  carry
       along the momentum, like the fast molecules in a sound wave.

       The competing actions of steepening and dispersion yield a series of
       wave pulses that  propagate  in  the  direction  of the shock.  As a
       result, the front acquires the shape of a "wave train."  The weakest
       (smaller-amplitude) waves announce  the  arrival  of  the train, and
       successively stronger oscillations build up until the full shock
       transition arrives.  The length of the train (in  other  words,  the
       thickness of the  shock  front) depends on how rapidly the energy of
       the waves dissipates.

       For waves propagating exactly perpendicular to the magnetic field,
       dispersion causes the harmonic wave speed to decrease at shorter
       wavelengths.  Short-wavelength harmonics now trail behind the shock
       front, and so they cannot affect steepening of the overall wave.  In
       this case, the  shock passes the  momentum  baton  to  a  series  of
       compressional pulses called solitons.

       Solitons in perpendicular shocks are approximately  the thickness of
       an electron's Larmor  radius,  and  they  are  created when the wave
       profile steepens to that scale.   The  steepening  front radiates an
       ordered sequence of solitons, led by the largest (highest-amplitude)
       one and trailed  by successively smaller ones that ultimately  blend
       into the smooth  state  behind the shock.  The length of the soliton
       train depends on  how fast the soliton  energy  is  dissipated  into
       heat.

       Waves on the  surface  of  shallow  water  behave   very  much  like
       dispersive waves in  collisionless  plasma.   The  theory of shallow
       water waves was developed in the late  19th  century, culminating in
       the classic work of Diederik J. Korteweg and G. DeVries  that  first
       described the solitons   that   occasionally  propagate  down  Dutch
       canals.  The seemingly  recondite   analogy  between  shallow  water
       solitons and plasma  solitons  expresses a general  physical  truth:
       solitons can form whenever wave steepening and dispersion compete.

       One implication of  this  fact  is that solitons form even in shocks
       that do not propagate exactly perpendicular  to  the magnetic field.
       The wave pulses  mentioned  earlier  can  also  be   thought  of  as
       solitons, the difference  being  that these solitons are rarefactive
       (low density) rather  than  compressive.    In   this  case,  short-
       wavelength harmonics travel relatively slowly (positive dispersion),
       and the greater the amplitude of the rarefactive soliton,  the  more
       slowly it propagates.

                                      Page 4





       As a result, the wave train terminates with the strongest soliton.
       Surface tension in  water  creates  small  waves  that have positive
       dispersion and rarefactive solitons.   The  physics  of  water waves
       therefore provides an analogy to both types of dispersion  found  in
       collisionless plasma.

       The elegant theory  of  solitons  is  an  impressive  achievement of
       modern mathematical physics.   In   1967   Martin  Kruskal  and  his
       colleagues at Princeton University proved that any wave profile in a
       dispersive medium that  can  support  steepening   evolves   into  a
       sequence of solitons.   By relating soliton theory to the problem of
       elementary particle collisions, which  has  been studied in depth in
       quantum physics since the 1920's, they showed that solitons preserve
       their identities when they collide, just as particles do.

       The understanding of dispersive shocks remains incomplete without a
       knowledge of how to dissipate the energy of waves or solitons into
       heat.  If not  for  the  effect of dissipation, the  train  of  wave
       structures making up the shock front would be infinitely long.  In
       effect, the fundamental question of how collisionless shock waves
       transport energy and momentum has reappeared, but in a new guise.

       In 1945 the  great  Soviet  physicist  Lev  D.  Landau  discovered a
       dissipation mechanism that requires no collisions between particles.
       Among the randomly moving particles  in  a  plasma,  a few happen to
       travel at a velocity that matches the velocity of the  plasma  wave.
       These particles are  said  to  be  in  resonance  with the wave.  An
       intense exchange of energy can take  place  between  a  wave and the
       particles resonant with it.

       In the early 1970s one of us (Sagdeev) and Vitaly Shapiro,  also  at
       the Institute of  Space  Research  in  Moscow,  showed that Landau's
       mechanism damps solitons by accelerating resonant ions.

       Consider, for example, a train of  compressive  solitons propagating
       perpendicular to the  magnetic  field.   Each soliton  generates  an
       electric field parallel  to its direction of motion.  Ions traveling
       close to the  resonant  velocity   move  slowly  compared  with  the
       solitons, and the soliton electric field is able to stop and reverse
       the motion of these ions.  The soliton loses part of  its  energy to
       the ions resonant with it during the interaction.

       The process does  not  end  here, because the magnetic Lorentz force
       curves the path of the reflected  ion  so  that it returns again and
       again to the same soliton.  Each encounter adds to the energy of the
       particle.  The Lorentz force, which grows stronger as the particle
       velocity increases, eventually throws the ion over the top of the
       first soliton.  The acceleration continues as the ion encounters the
       remaining solitons in the wave train.

       The resonant ions gain energy much as surfers gain  speed  by riding
       ocean waves.  This analogy inspired John M. Dowson of the University
       of California at  Los  Angeles  to  design  a  new  kind  of charged
       particle accelerator, which he dubbed the SURFATRON.

       The heating of ions by solitons can  form  a  shock if the number of
       ions in resonance is great enough.  Such is the case if the ions are
       hot.  If not,  the  solitons  find another way to dissipate  energy:
       they themselves generate  microscopic  plasma  waves  that  heat the
       plasma.
                                      Page 5





       Plasma electrons flow  over  ions,  thereby  creating  the  electric
       current responsible for the characteristic  soliton  magnetic  field
       profile.  If the  ions are cold, the electrons can  easily  move  at
       supersonic velocities relative  to  the  ions,  in  which  case  the
       electrons amplify extremely small  scale electric field oscillations
       called ion acoustic  waves.  These waves, which do  not  affect  the
       magnetic field, grow in an avalanche-like fashion.

       The plasma particles collide not with one another but with these ion
       acoustic waves.  After  the  waves  develop,  the  plasma  enters  a
       microturbulent state.

       In 1968 Robert  W. Fredericks and  his  colleagues  at  TRW  in  Los
       Angeles were the first to detect ion acoustic waves in shocks.  They
       made this discovery using instruments on the OGO-5  spacecraft  that
       were designed specifically  to  study  plasma waves in space.  Since
       then, plasmawave detectors have been  included on most space mission
       concerned with solar system plasmas, notably the International  Sun-
       Earth Explorers (ISEE  1,  2 and 3) in earth orbit and the Voyager 1
       and 2 missions to the outer planets.  The late Fred Scarf of TRW and
       his collaborators often played back the microturbulent-wave electric
       fields recorded by  the  ISEE  and  Voyager  spacecraft  through  an
       ordinary loudspeaker.  To   most  listeners,  shocks   would   sound
       cacophonous; to our ears, however, they were a symphony of space.

       Although easy to  record,  microturbulence  has  proved difficult to
       understand completely.  Theorists  turned  to numerical computations
       to help elucidate the behavior of a strongly microturbulent plasma.

       By solving millions  of  equations  of  motion  for  the  particles,
       computer simulation shows  how  ion acoustic waves grow and heat the
       plasma.  Today's supercomputers   are   just   beginning   to   give
       scientists comprehensive understanding  of many different  kinds  of
       microturbulence.

       Even without knowing the detailed nature of microturbulent plasma,
       physicists can deduce its general behavior.  Electrons in the plasma
       transfer their momentum   to  ion  acoustic  waves,  which  in  turn
       transfer it to  ions.   This  process  retards  the  motion  of  the
       electrons in the plasma and so creates resistance  to  the  electric
       current.  In some   shocks,   ion   acoustic-wave  resistance  grows
       sufficiently intense to suppress the  generation  of solitons.  When
       this happens, no  wave  train  forms,  and  the  shock   is   called
       resistive.

       Although both simple dispersive and resistive shocks have been found
       in space, most   shocks   observed  there  have  entirely  different
       characteristics from those  discussed   so  far.   Most  shocks  are
       sufficiently powerful that  neither  dispersion nor  resistance  can
       prevent steepening from causing the waves to overturn.  Overturning
       then leads to a host of new shock phenomena.

       A consideration of   shallow   water  waves,  once  more,  helps  to
       illustrate the process of overturning.   When  a  shallow ocean wave
       grows sufficiently high,  the tip of its wave crest  swings  forward
       through an arc  and  ultimately  collapses under gravity.  The water
       stream from behind the crest collides  with  that ahead, giving rise
       to the foam on whitecaps.  Thus, a large wave crashing  toward shore
       repeatedly overturns, or "breaks."

                                      Page 6





       A plasma wave  also  develops  overlapping  velocity  streams  as it
       overturns.  The fastest stream, which  comes  from  the  wave crest,
       invades the plasma  ahead  of  the shock front.  The  Lorentz  force
       turns the ions  in this stream back into the shock.  These reflected
       ions ultimately mix with those behind  the  front.   If the shock is
       weak, its structure will remain steady.  If the shock is strong, ion
       reflection will temporarily overwhelm steepening; however, the shock
       soon steepens again, and the cycle repeats.

       Recent numerical simulations by Kevin B. Quest and his colleagues at
       Los Alamos National  Laboratory  confirm the idea that  very  strong
       shock waves consist  of  a repeated cycle of steepening, overturning
       and ion reflection.

       The interactions between reflected and flowing ions can also lead to
       microturbulence.  The Voyager  spacecraft   detected   ion  acoustic
       waves, this time generated by ions reflected by Jupiter's  bow shock
       [see top illustration  on page 110].  Near the earth, reflected ions
       generate waves in  the solar wind  at  the  geometric  mean  of  the
       frequencies of rotation of the ions and electrons about  the earth's
       magnetic field; this  mean  is  called  the  lower  hybrid-resonance
       frequency.

       In 1985 the  Soviet-Czech  Intershock   spacecraft  made  the  first
       definitive measurements of lower hybrid turbulence  in  the  earth's
       bow shock.  Around  both planets, the ion acoustic waves take energy
       from ions and give it to electrons.   Some  heated  electrons escape
       forward into the solar-wind flow, others back into the shock zone.

       So far we have concentrated on those shocks propagating more or less
       at right angles  to  the  magnetic  field,  those  physicists   call
       quasiperpendicular.  Plasma turbulence  is  even more important when
       the shock propagates almost parallel  to  the  magnetic  field.  The
       field no longer holds back the fast particles that rush ahead of a
       quasiparallel shock.  These   particles  are  a  major   source   of
       turbulent instability.

       The ability of the magnetic field to channel particle motion along
       field lines creates  a  situation  analogous  to  a  fire  hose left
       spraying water on the ground.  Bends in the hose become increasingly
       curved by the centrifugal force of the flowing water; eventually the
       hose wriggles uncontrollably on the ground.

       The magnetic field channeling the  overlapping  plasma streams ahead
       of a quasiparallel  shock  experiences a similar instability,  often
       called the fire-hose  instability.  The centrifugal force that bends
       the magnetic field lines is proportional to the density of energy in
       plasma motion along the magnetic  field.   Instability  occurs  when
       this energy density  exceeds  that  of  the  magnetic  field.   Many
       physicists conceived of the fire-hose instability independently, but
       the version invented  in  1961 by Eugene N. Parker of the University
       of Chicago was tailored specifically to quasiparallel shocks.

       The plasma fire-hose instability  leads  to  a random flexing of the
       magnetic field lines.   This  kind  of  magnetic turbulence  can  be
       regarded as a chaotic ensemble of "torsional" waves, that is, ones
       that twist the  magnetic  field  lines.   They  are  known as Alfven
       waves, after Hannes Alfven of the  Royal  Institute of Technology in
       Stockholm, who first described them.

                                      Page 7





       Alfven waves, like  ion  acoustic  waves,  can  exchange  energy and
       momentum with ions in resonance with them.  As far as the ions are
       concerned, the interaction with Alfven  waves  mimics  the effect of
       collisions.  Thus, Alfven  waves  limit  how far ions  escaping  the
       shock can penetrate  upstream  and  determine  the  thickness of the
       quasiparallel shock.

       Theory predicts that collisions between ions and Alfven waves should
       be nearly elastic, that is, they should  involve only slight changes
       in energy despite a large change in momentum (for  example,  when  a
       rubber ball bounces  off a hard wall, its momentum reverses, but its
       energy remains essentially  the same).   As  a  result,  the  Alfven
       turbulence inside the  shock  front  should disintegrate  relatively
       slowly.  This notion  led  us to conclude in 1967 that quasiparallel
       shocks could be much thicker than quasiperpendicular ones.

       The very first measurements of the earth's bow shock by the IMP-1
       spacecraft in 1964 hinted at the substantial differences between
       parallel and perpendicular shocks.  The data returned by IMP-1 were
       somewhat puzzling at first because sometimes the shock appeared thin
       and other times it appeared thick.   Three  years later we suggested
       that shock structure  could  depend  on  the  orientation   of   the
       interplanetary magnetic field.

       In 1971 Eugene W. Greenstadt of TRW and his colleagues assembled the
       first evidence that  the  thickness  of  the  earth's bow shock does
       indeed vary with the direction of  the  solar-wind  magnetic  field.
       Since this field constantly changes direction, the regions where the
       bow shock is   locally   quasiperpendicular   and    where   it   is
       quasiparallel are always  moving,  even  if the shock itself remains
       fairly stationary.  Wherever the shock  is quasiperpendicular, it is
       thin; where it  is quasiparallel, it is thick [see  illustration  on
       page 107].

       In the early  1970s  spacecraft  began  to  detect  small  fluxes of
       energetic particles, ion  acoustic   waves   and  Alfven  waves  far
       upstream of where the earth's bow shock was understood  to  be.  The
       ISEE program, which  started  in  1977,  established  that  all  the
       upstream activity is actually part  of  the  extended  quasiparallel
       shock.  The shock  is  so  thick  that  it  dwarfs  the  earth,  and
       therefore earth-orbiting satellites cannot really measure its size.

       Another, larger class of shocks does lend itself to investigation by
       spacecraft, however.  Flares in the solar corona occasionally launch
       gigantic shock waves   that  propagate  through  the  interplanetary
       medium to the  far  reaches  of the  solar  system.   These  can  be
       observed as they sweep by instrumented spacecraft.

       One of us (Kennel), along with colleagues in the ISEE project, found
       that the region  of Alfven and ion acoustic turbulence  upstream  of
       quasi-parallel interplanetary shocks  can  be  more  than  a million
       kilometers thick.

       Alfven waves play a particularly prominent role in the shocks that
       form ahead of comets as they pass  through  the  solar  wind  in the
       inner solar system.  Cometary nuclei are far too small to cause any
       detectable physical disturbance in the flow of the solar wind (the
       nucleus of Halley's  comet,  for instance, measures  only  about  15
       kilometers across), and the nuclei possess a negligible magnetic

                                      Page 8





       field.  Because of  these  properties, comets cannot generate shocks
       in the way  that planets do.  Nevertheless,  scientists  have  found
       that when comets  approach the sun, they create large  collisionless
       shocks.

       Sunlight evaporates atoms  and  molecules  from  the  surface  of  a
       comet's nucleus.  Most of the liberated  gas  is  ionized  by  solar
       ultraviolet light and forms a plasma cloud similar  to  the  earth's
       ionosphere.  The solar    wind   never   penetrates   the   cometary
       ionosphere, and it is not the ionosphere  that forms the shock wave.
       The key players  in producing cometary shocks are  the  few  neutral
       atoms and molecules  that  manage  to escape the comet's ionosphere.
       These, too, are ultimately ionized, but farther out, where they have
       entered the solar wind.

       The newly ionized particles respond  to  the  electric  and magnetic
       fields of the  solar  wind by joining the flow.  They  increase  the
       mass density of  the  solar  wind,  which,  according  to the law of
       conservation of momentum,  decreases   the   wind   speed.   Because
       cometary ions are much heavier than the protons of the solar wind, a
       number of cometary ions can slow the wind appreciably.

       More than 20  years ago Ludwig Biermann of the Max Planck  Institute
       for Astophysics in  Munich suggested that such a decelerating solar-
       wind flow should produce a shock similar  to  a planetary bow shock.
       During its 1986  encounter with Comet Halley, the Soviet  spacecraft
       Vega-1 heard the  plasma  wave cacophony that signaled the existence
       of a shock wave about one million  kilometers  from the nucleus, the
       distance predicted by Biermann's theory.

       The Soviety Vega, Japanese Suisei and the European Giotto spacecraft
       encountered both quasiperpendicular  and  quasiparallel   shocks  at
       Comet Halley.  The quasiparallel shocks were similar to those at the
       planets.  Heavy ions upstream of the quasiperpendicular cometary
       shocks generated intense Alfven-wave turbulence, however, something
       that does not happen around the planets.

       Shocks that generate  Alfven waves can also accelerate a small group
       of particles to high energies.  The  "collisions"  of particles with
       Alfven waves return  escaping  particles  back to the  shock  front.
       Each time they  recross  the  shock,  the  particles  increase their
       energy.  This acceleration mechanism  is  based  on  one proposed by
       Enrico Fermi in 1954.

       In 1986 one of us (Kennel) and his ISEE collaborators  found  that a
       theory of Fermi  acceleration developed for interplanetary shocks by
       Martin A. Lee of the University of New Hampshire successfully passed
       the test of observations.  Yet the  Fermi process develops so slowly
       that the protons accelerated by quasiparallel interplanetary  shocks
       only reach energies  of a few hundred thousand electron volts in the
       one day it takes the shock to travel  from the sun to the earth.  In
       comparison, cosmic rays--energetic  subatomic particles  and  atomic
       nuclei from deep  space--have  energies  up to 100 trillion electron
       volts.

       Exploding stars--supernovas--create  very  strong  shocks that speed
       into the interstellar plasma at tens of thousands of  kilometers per
       second.  We cannot  put a space probe ahead of a supernova shock, so
       we cannot say for sure whether the shock generates Alfven waves and

                                      Page 9





       accelerates interstellar ions.   We can, however, apply to supernova
       shocks the theory  of particle acceleration  that  is  being  tested
       today using solar system shocks.

       Since supernova shocks last about a million years before dying out,
       particles have time to reach extremely high energies via the Fermi
       process.  Working independently,   Germogen  F.  Krymskii   of   the
       Institute of Space   Physics   Research  and  Aeronomy  in  Yakutsk,
       U.S.S.R., Roger D.  Blandford  of   the   California   Institute  of
       Technology and Ian  W.   Axford  of  the  Max Planck  Institute  for
       Aeronomy in Katlenburg-Lindau,   together   with  their  colleagues,
       showed in 1977 that the distribution  in  energy  of  the  particles
       accelerated by collision-less shocks is virtually identical  to that
       of cosmic rays.

       The origin of   cosmic   rays   has   long   been  a  puzzle.   Many
       astophysicists now believe that  they  are  created  when  supernova
       shocks accelerate particles, although it is still not understood how
       the particles reach the highest energies observed.

       Collisionless shocks probably  exist  even  around remote  galaxies.
       Dynamic processes in the centers of some active galaxies (possibly
       involving a massive black hole) create supersonic jets hundreds of
       thousands of light-years long.  Shocks are likely to occur when the
       jets interact with   the   plasma  surrounding  the  galaxy.   Radio
       emissions from the jets indicate that  electrons  are accelerated to
       extremely high energies.  Albert A. Galeev, director  of  the Soviet
       Institute of Space  Research,  suggests  that  a  theory  he and his
       colleagues developed to explain how  lower  hybrid  waves accelerate
       electrons in the  earth's bow shock may also clarify  how  electrons
       are accelerated in galactic jets.

       Contemporary collisionless shock research encompasses phenomena that
       vary tremendously in  scale  and  origin.   The concepts that we and
       others developed 20 years ago have  turned  out  to  be a reasonable
       basis for understanding collisionless shocks.  Spacecraft have found
       individual examples of most of the shock types predicted by theory.
       Still to come  are  refined measurements and numerical  calculations
       that simulate in  detail  the  impressive variety of shocks found in
       nature.

       In most cases, the fairly simple mechanisms  we  have described here
       are intertwined in  fascinating  ways.   Yet even now  collisionless
       shock theory has   enabled   physicists   to   speculate  with  some
       confidence on the physical processes underlying some of the grandest
       and most violent phenomena in the universe.
