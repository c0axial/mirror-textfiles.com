The following is from a personal experience that Bruce had which he wished to
share with others who study such matters.  I made up a GIF image so you can
get an idea of how it works, as far as I can tell from reading the file and
talking with Bruce.  It is a fascinating story and if you choose to experiment
with it, please share your experiences with all of us here at KeelyNet.

Personal experience with overunity toy.

 I grew up on a farm, and I had a great uncle that was a tinkerer.  He lived
on another farm about 10 miles away.  He was the kind of person that would
spend 4 days building something to save 15 minutes once a year.  Like I said
he was a tinkerer.  He also was quite an inventor, although he didn't I think
know it.  He never tried to sell anything that he invented, his thing was
doing it, not to make money, he just enjoyed building things.

 When I was about 7 or 8 years old, we went over to visit with them.  He was
showing my grandfather the new toy that he had built for his boys, he had two
sons that were about 10 and 12 and twin girls about 15 and twin boys about 18.
As best I can remember the toy was about two feet high and about one foot
square.  It consisted of a spiral ramp that I think made about 3 1/2 turns
from the top to the bottom, at the bottom of the ramp was a paddle wheel.

 This was connected through some gears to an elevator that went to the top.
At the top was a hopper.  In this hopper was placed about 10 marbles.  There
was a trip door on the hopper that would only let out one marble at a time.  I
think that it would release so that only one marble was going down the ramp at
a time.  Anyway, he tripped the gate and one marble rolled down the ramp, it
took maybe 3 to 5 seconds to get to the bottom.  It hit the paddlewheel and
spun it causing the elevator to move up a little, this released another marble
which repeated the process, this time the first marble was on the elevator and
was moved up toward the hopper.  I think there was about 5 marbles on the
elevator at a time.  Anyway once he started the toy running, it continued to
run.  He said that you had to have all the marbles in the hopper to start,
once the first few marbles had hit the paddle wheel, it spun continuously.

 We were at their house for about three or four hours, and I spent most of my
time watching the toy run.  One time I touched the paddle wheel and it
stopped.  My uncle came over and scolded me for touching it, he then moved all
the marbles to the hopper and started it again.  It was still running when we
left.

 It was years later before I realized what I had seen, and by then my uncle
had died.  I talked to his sons and they remembered the toy working the same
as I did, but they didn't know what had happened to it, but said that my uncle
had probably taken it apart and used the parts on other of his tinkering. They
said that this was usually what he did, once the boys had tired of one of the
toys he'd built for them, he would take it apart and build something else from
it.

 I don't know if my uncle knew that he had violated any of the "laws" or not
with this toy.  I doubt it, he probably just wanted to make something that
would run without help and so he built it.  I asked the boys if he had built
other toys or machines that ran by themselves, and they didn't know of any.  I
questioned them about if there was a motor or anything on the toy, being I was
young, and may not have been aware of it.  They assured me that there was
nothing on it and the marbles made it run.  They said that it had ran for
weeks at one time and then stopped, and my uncle had cleaned it and it again
worked.  Sitting in an old farm house, I imagine that it got covered with dust
and that increased the friction enough to drop below unity.

 Anyway this experience convinced me that overunity machines can be built.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Note: the spiral ramp is in effect a vortex and it appears that vortexes in
       some way add energy to things, they keep reappearing in many overunity
       ideas.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A little background on me, I am a graduate Electronic Engineer, but I have an
open mind, I have been into alternative energy for 20 years now and I look at
things in this way,

   First I am sure that overunity is possible, because I have seen it.

   Second, I don't believe that the physical laws are all that unforgiving,
   that is I believe that every law has at least one exception, and I really
   believe that they all have several.

So if something doesn't obey a law, I don't get bent out of shape, I just
think, well so it doesn't fit into the conventional theory.....Bruce Welsh
