                        VACUUM ENERGY: A BREAKTHROUGH?

[heading]

By Andrei Samokhin

The model of a plasma generator which can convert physical-vacuum energy into
electricity has been developed under Prof.  Alexander CHERNETSKI at the Moscow
Georgi Plekhanov Institute of the National Economy.  Such generators could lay
the groundwork for the future environmentally-benign power industry.

Classical physics cannot explain what happens when a plasma discharger placed
in the Chernetski circuit is started: for no apparent reason the ammeter
pointer shows triple strength-of-current increase [sic] and energy output is
several times above input.  The plant's efficiency is much more than 1.

No magic is intended.  Additional energy outputs at specific plasma discharges
are fixed in several independent expert reports by the Lenin All-Union
Institute of Electrical Engineering.  This effect has been checked using
different methods.

Whence this mysterious energy?

Self-generating discharge
-------------------------

Prof Chernetski, author of the first-ever study paper on plasma diagnostics
equipment (he has been in this field for 40 years now) and 20 inventions,
never knew what probing into specific unstable plasma states at strong-current
discharges could have led to.  In the early 70s, he and fellow-researcher Yuri
Galkin worked on a basically new type of high-frequency plasma generator which
could at high power do without unwieldy energy converters.  In one test, they
discovered a decided input-to-output energy gap. [sic]

"I knew electron drift begins in plasma and sought to deduce a combination of
variables in which fluctuating plasma instability emerged in discharge,"
Chernetski says.  "Gas discharge was meant to serve as a powerful stimulator
of electromagnetic modes and, all of a sudden and in defiance of the law of
conservation of energy, a strange energy IMBALANCE was produced.  Repeated
experiments with different circuits proved energy output to be ALWAYS GREATER
than input."

The mysterious discharge stimulating additional energy extraction was called
the "self generating discharge (SGD)".  Measurements showed that part of the
discharge power went back into the network as if two series-connected
electromotive forces were at work.

In a bid to try to explain the experimental data, the researchers actually
tried to prove the impossible.  One of their proofs was very "strong".  The
one-megawatt substation of the Moscow Aviation Institute, where Chernetski and
Galkin were staging an experiment with a powerful plasma unit, burned out.

When the discharge currents reached criticality, superstrong current was
"born" in the generator and went back into the network, playing havoc with the
safety devices calculated for short-circuit.  Later on, they read in books
that earlier in the century the power plant of prominent Yugoslav electrical
engineer Nikola Tesla caught fire under similar circumstances in the United
States.  Chernetski and Galkin were sure that Tesla was making such
experiments, but did not publish the results.  They are also sure that vacuum
energy can explain this mysterious effect.

A vacuum-Powered Lamp

The researchers relied on the present-day quantum physics idea of "zero-point
oscillations" in physical vacuum.  Such oscillations signifying the birth and
annihilation of virtual pairs -- the particle and anti-particle, distinguished
from the normal elementary particles by a negligibly short life, a mere
8.10/-21[sic] sec.  Emerging BELOW the zero energy level from "nothing" and
returning to "nothing", these virtual particles appeared to defy the law of
conservation of energy.

Quantum electrodynamics explains this paradox through the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle.  Under it all the precise particle characteristics
cannot be learned simultaneously and, therefore, one must not require from
nature "punctual" abidance by the law during such a short time as the life of
virtual pairs.  The observer fails to notice anything, while every virtual
pair is more than real, carrying an energy of more than half a million
electron-volts during its lifetime.  The potential energy in the electric bulb
vacuum is enough to boil the earth's oceans, Americans John Wheeler and
Richard Feynman have calculated.

Until recently the vacuum energy idea was only a daring hypothesis bordering
on science-fiction.  The lamp powered by vacuum in Chernetski's basememt
laboratory in the center of Moscow made it a reality.

This is how he explains his miraculous experiment: "The self-generating
discharge emerges when the discharge current reaches a definite critical
density, when the magnetic fields they create ensure magnetization of plasma
electrons and they begin to perform MOSTLY CYCLOID movements.  The interaction
of currents with their magnetic fields forces the electrons to deviate to the
CYLINDER-SHAPED discharge axis and the electrical field emerges.  It has
proved to 'switch on' the physical vacuum: in this field the vacuum is
polarized and consequently the virtual pairs begin to move in a definite
direction, instead of chaotically.

The virtual positrons accelerate plasma electrons, giving them part of their
energy.  The current in the circuit builds up and additional energy is
discharged on the resistor switched into the discharge circuit.  Clearly, only
part of the tremendous vacuum energy is extracted.

"We've developed several circuit versions which can find application.  In the
later experiment with an input power of 700 watts, the energy extracted by the
generator load resistance was three kilowatts, or nearly five times more.
This is by far not the limit and with more powerful plants and the
corresponding calculations; megawatts of free electricity can be produced from
a minimal power source."

Self-Generating-Discharge Plasmatron and Space Travel

Yuri Galkin looks at the future of their discovery: "Its applications are
wide-ranging.  For example, engines can be developed, based on the self-
generating-discharge plasmatron.  Until now all attempts to use plasmatrons as
engines have failed, because strong electron and ion bombardments rapidly
burnt out the electrodes.  Self-generating discharge leaves them intact and
such engines can be used in aircraft, trains and autos.  It would be logical
to create a new environmentally-wise power industry.  Portable hydros, wind
power plants and solar batteries boosted by self-generating discharge could
become an enormous source of electricity.  With time, they could edge out the
costly and hazardous fuel-firing and hydraulic [hydroelectric?] facilities.

Already now we can build a plant which would supply electricity for a township
or factory.  A vacuum power station comparable to giant facilities could be
designed today.  Our discovery can revolutionize cosmonautics."

Laboratory experiments have proved the possibility of using the KINETIC EFFECT
of self-generating discharge for accelerating bodies in space.  Galkin has
calculated the parameters of a self-generating-discharge plasmatron that could
serve as the propulsion engine of the future, replacing the present unwieldy
rocket engines.  Powered by a minor TEN-VOLT SOURCE, it can deliver power
enough for the takeoff of a large spaceship.  Tapping the ambient space
vacuum, it could fly eternally.

Unknown Waves

"We didn't think of only industrial applications," Chernetski recalls.  "Self-
generating discharge turned out to produce wave radiation which was hitherto
unknown, but evidently existent at all times.  Like sound waves, its waves
have a longitudinal electric field component and a high penetrability through
conductive mediums, including metals.  It turned out that these single waves,
work to 'awaken' the hidden vacuum energy and can alter the structure of
substances.  "The experiment staged at the Burdenko Institute of Neurosurgery
in Moscow several years ago showed that directional SGD radiation accelerated
nuclear beta-decomposition by 5%-6%.  This is only one example.

We supposed that, like SGD-generator radiation, longitudinal electric-field
component waves could also be produced by living beings, man in particular.
Comparative experiments were staged to prove the impact on men with
extrasensory perception and of our device on different objects.  In both cases
parallel impact on the high-stability quartz generator made its frequency
'drift' by several orders of magnitude.  The filament resistance of the
incandescent lamp decreased considerably.  Probably we are on the road to
explaining such mysterious things as extrasensory perception, telekinesis and
bioenergy.

Vacuum-Ether

The experimentally-verified concept of Chernetski claims to be a theoretical
breakthrough in the basic quantum-physics idea of the energy structure of the
Universe.  It is generally recognised among physicists that all elementary
particle interactions, and hence every existing phenomenon, occur with the
help of virtual-particle exchange.  How does it come about?

"Full annihilation of virtual pairs cannot take place in the event of partial
energy extraction in self-generating discharge, because a 'certain' virtual
dipole must emerge -- two separate charges with a common negative energy.
This means that together with energy extraction vacuum structurisation and
ordering takes place.

Actually, our concept is a return to the idea of the universal ether at an
entirely new level.  We say that the ordered dipole vacuum, or ether, is an
all-penetrating energy medium in which processes occur which are related to
virtual dipoles and subject to the uncertainty principle of modern physics."

Chernetski asks: if vacuum structurisation is a constant process, isn't this
an opportunity to state the law of conservation of entropy in the Universe in
opposition to the idea of its steadfast decrease?

What if this work helps to clear up the nature of gravitation, which is as dim
now as it was in the times of Newton?  What his concept of the vacuum shows
the road to the long-awaited explanation of the Grand Unification theory?

"As as experimental physicist I won't say our theory is 100 percent correct,"
Chernetski declares.  "It's much more an opportunity now to have indisputable
experimental data to prove the opportunity of creating a basically new power
industry."

Only a rapid switch to new energy can save human civilisation from ecological
catastrophe.  The research program must be developed immediately and a center
set up to coordinate cooperation between world scientists.  Natural and
unlimited vacuum energy is at our doorstep.
