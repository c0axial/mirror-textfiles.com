       Abstract: Utilizing fundamental    new   definitions   for   energy,
                 potential, and scalar potential, the mass  of  the  atomic
                 nucleus may  be considered a powerful electrostatic scalar
                 potential, referred to as the mass potential.

                 The Whittaker EM biwave  structure of the scalar potential
                 then becomes a new and universal internal EM structure for
                 mass, including the atomic nucleus.  This structure can be
                 directly manipulated  electromagnetically,   which  allows
                 direct EM  alteration  of  the  mass  potential,  and  the
                 nucleus itself.

                 This totally new class of  nuclear interactions is briefly
                 explored, and several hypothesized mechanisms advanced for
                 neutralizing or  processing  nuclear  wastes.   Additional
                 applications are     hypothesized     for     experimental
                 falsification or verification.

       Abstract: Unrecognized for what it was, in 1903-1904 E.T.  Whittaker
                 (W) published   a   fundamental,  engineerable  theory  of
                 electrogravitation (EG) in two profound papers.  The first
                 (W-1903) demonstrated   a  hidden  bidirectional  EM  wave
                 structure in  the scalar potential of vacuum,  and  showed
                 how to  produce  a  standing scalar EM potential wave--the
                 same wave discovered experimentally  four years earlier by
                 Nikola Tesla.

                 W-1903 is  a  hidden  variable theory that  shows  how  to
                 deterministically curve the local and/or distant spacetime
                 using EM.   W-1904  shows  that  all force field EM can be
                 replaced by  interferometry   of  two  scalar  potentials,
                 anticipating the  Aharonov-Bohm effect  by  55  years  and
                 extending it to the engineerable macroscopic world.

                 W-1903 shows  how to turn EM into G-potential, curve local
                 and/or distant  spacetime,   and   directly  engineer  the
                 virtual particle flux of vacuum.  W-1904 shows how to turn
                 G-potential and curvature of spacetime  back  into  force-
                 field EM, even at a distance.

                 The papers   implement   Sahkarov's  1968  statement  that
                 gravitation is not a fundamental  field  of  nature, but a
                 conglomerate of  other  fields.   Separately   applied  to
                 electromagnetics (EM), quantum mechanics (QM), and general
                 relativity (GR), an extended superset of each results.

                 The three  supersets  are  Whittaker-unified,  so  that  a
                 testable, engineerable, unified field theory is generated.
                 EM, QM, and GR each contained  a  fundamental  error  that
                 blocked unification, and these three errors are explained.

                 The Schroedinger  potential  can  also be  structured  and
                 altered, indicating  the  direct  engineering  of physical
                 quantum change.  Recently Ignatovich has pointed out this

                 hidden bidirectional EM wave structure in the Schroedinger
                 potential, without  referncing  Whittaker's 1903 discovery
                 of the basic effect.  The  potential  for applying the new
                 approach to explain the nature of mind  and  thought,  and
                 providing a   laboratory-testable   theory  for  them,  is
                 briefly noted and indicative major references cited.  Some
                 of the possible implications  for  physics and biology are
                 pointed out.  (Author abstract) 36 Refs.

       Abstract: Based on E.T.  Whittaker's  previously unnoticed 1903-1904
                 papers which  established a hidden bidirectional  EM  wave
                 structure in  a standing forcefield free scalar potential,
                 a method of directly engineering  the ambient potential of
                 the vacuum has been developed and realized experimentally.

                 Adding Whittaker's engineerable hidden variable  theory to
                 classical electromagnetics, quantum mechanics, and general
                 relativity produces  supersets  of each discipline.  These
                 supersets are  joined  by  the  common  Whittaker  subset,
                 producing a unified field theory that is  engineerable and
                 tested.

                 By treating  the  nucleus  of  the  atom as a pumped phase
                 conjugate mirror, several working model energy units
                 have been produced which  excite  and  organize  the local
                 vacuum, increase  the  local virtual photon  flux  between
                 local vacuum   and   nucleus,   establish  coherent  self-
                 oscillations between the  local  excited  vacuum  and  the
                 affected nuclei,  utilize  the  self-oscillating  standing
                 wave for  self-pumping  of the nuclei/mirrors, introduce a
                 very tiny signal wave to  the  mirrors, and output into an
                 extenal load circuit a powerful, amplified, time-reserved

                 phase conjugate  replica  wave  at  60 Hertz frequency and
                 nominal 120 volt sine wave power.

                 Several models have been built, ranging from 6 watts early
                 on to  one  of  5  kilkowatts.   Both  closed  batteryless
                 systems with  damped  positive  feedback   and  open  loop
                 systems with  battery-powered input have been successfully
                 built.  Open loop power  gains  of  from  5  multiplied by
                 10**4 to 1.5 multiplied by 10**6 have been achieved.

                 Antigravity experiments   have   also  been   successfully
                 conducted where  the weight of the unit was reduced by 90%
                 in controlled experiments, with a signal wave input of 175
                 microwatts and an output  of 1 kilowatt.  The basic theory
                 of the  device  is  briefly  explained  and   experimental
                 results presented.

                 In the demonstration session, a videotape of one operating
                 open-loop unit  with  a 1.5 multiplied by 10**6 power gain
                 is planned, as is the demonstration  of  an actual working
                 model closed-loop  system  with a nominal  rating  of  500
                 watts, and  without external power input of any kind.  The
                 units are solid state, with no moving parts.

                 Each of  them comprises  a  unique  form  of  self-powered
                 vacuum triode  of  extraordinary gain, where  the  cathode
                 power and  plate power are freely furnished by the vacuum,
                 and only a small grid signal need be furnished either from
                 an external power source  or  by clamped positive feedback
                 from the device's output.  The output is  negative energy,
                 and some of its unique characteristics are pointed out.

                 Implications of  the experimental application of the Sweet
                 vacuum triode, the Bearden  approach  to  the nucleus as a
                 pumped phase  conjugate  mirror,  and  the  unified  field
                 theory based  on  Whittaker's engineerable hidden variable
                 scalar EM potential theory  are  also  briefly  addressed.
