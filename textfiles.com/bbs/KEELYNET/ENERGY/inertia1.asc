Greetings,

On Mr. Kidd's paper the device is also known as the Mark III A/G thrust unit.

I too had built a "short lived" prototype in the Autumn of '79 of a
precessional torque thrust module that certainly produced a desired and
complete force in an upward direction.

What brought me to such an interest was from a wrist excersizer then known as
the "DynaBee". Unique motions were observed when RPM threshold reached approx.
10,000 rpm. The DynaBee is twisted about where a weighted gyros pivotals rub
on an inner flange after the gyro is started by the user.

This simple little sportsmans accessory is what sparked me off after
repeatedly disturbing its axis thus resulting a force of precessional torque
that I had called at the time as the "prime movement".

The prototype involved two main platforms...one above the other that would
rotate in equal, exact opposite directions. Each of the platforms had three
motor spun surplus gyros pivoted on their own two degree bearings. The third
degree pivot was spring loaded as the main axis influenced by the resulting
thrust force.

All gyros were brought to near 20,000 rpm then the platforms were rotated to
about 45-50 rpm.  The result was a fairly stable upward force.

Note at this point the energy to maintain prime speed was approximately 1/4
that needed to bring all gyros to speed and stabilize.

My budget and lack for proper representation were not at the time.  I am
pleased to see confirmation of Mr. Kidd's work and welcome communications from
him and his peers.

Thank you for your time and look forward to your replies.

                                        V.R.
                                        David A. Duca, KA9JSV

Hi David!

Thank you for an excellent description of your experiments and source of
inspiration for what I consider confirming information about Sandy Kidds
invention.  We were contacted by the TV show Beyond 2000 and they bought a set
of KeelyNet disks...a very nice letter was included saying just from the
information they had downloaded from a friends Australian KeelyNet mirror,
they had enough info to do 2 years worth of shows but wanted the whole fileset
while it was available...about 6 months to 1 year after this, they did a short
video of Sandy Kidd that I have a copy of....it does not actually free
levitate but instead seems to lift against a counterweight....

The other really hot correlations with this are Cook or Thornsens inertial
drives....they use a cycloid motion to produce unidirectionaly thrust without
needing a reaction medium....in other words, they appear to be able to move in
ANY DIRECTION....I wrote this up in one of my past newsletters after seeing
Thornsens video of how he propelled a canoe across a pool at 82 feet/min using
only his inertial driver...no propeller or such touched the water, just these
tiny forward jerks to pull the mass....quite incredible...

The hot correlation that I found energywise is in Russian researcher
Chernetski as detailed in the PLASMAFE.ZIP article on KeelyNet, I will attempt
to send both of these files to you though I've not had much success with file
transmissions on the InterNet...  Thank you very much for letting me know
about your research in this area, I am truly fascinated!!!

There is no reason to negate the possibility of causing the electrons in atoms
to form a cycloid AND with all atoms polarized so that each cycloid is driving
in the same direction, the mass would simply move without all that mechanical
garbage...!!!!  Keely says you can use sound to 'graduate' a mass, causing all
atoms and molecules to polarize (just means line up in this case) into what
has now been actually created in a lab as a Bose Einstein Condensate!!!  Dan
Davidson and I wrote an article predicting this in Oct. of 94 that just got
published in the June ITS (Tesla journal) and just this past week, two
physicists in Boulder actually proved it with the creation of this strange
form of matter...

One other point, Eric Laithwaite did a demonstration in front of Harold Aspden
where he took a heavy metal disk suspended on a bearing and attached to a
shaft.....you hold the shaft in both hands out in front of you and somewhat
close to the body...then while the heavy disk is spinning, you try to life the
shaft upwards......it WON'T GO UP, it goes sideways and up, no matter how much
force you use....successive still photos of this show that the arc prescribed
is 32.8 degrees, (this might not be the EXACT NUMBER, but I am quoting from
memory) which is exactly the angle found in DNA.....Aspden thinks this angle
has free energy and other applications....anyway, thanks again for sharing
your information, I think it will make a wonderful followup file for the BBS
with relation the Kidd type precessional/inertial drives......I will add your
address to my phone book......>>>  Jerry/KeelyNet/Dallas (214) 324-3501

What follows is from the October 1995 Roundtable mailer

October 11, 1994
                 Notice of Vanguard Sciences Roundtable Meeting
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greetings!  This is your reminder for our 24th meeting of the Roundtable.  Can
you believe as of October, 94' this will be two years of monthly meetings?

Something really amazing seems to be congealing in the minds of many people
with whom we all have been in contact or read about.  It relates to what
appears to be a Universal Principle manifesting in nature as a CYCLOID.

KeelyNet has long promoted the idea that geometry, frequency and spin are key
elements necessary to achieve much of the phenomena we are trying to qualify
and eventually quantify through a working and reproducible device.

Victor Schauberger proved the Cycloid form was most easily created by use of
an egg shaped flow pattern.  Rudolph Steiner also said the heart shaped flow
produced an inflowing, life-giving rotation which nature used when building
new life, healing or accumulating energy.  The life-enhancing effects can be
augmented by using magnets, crystals, copper and other elements in the right
combinations.  Now, there have arisen numerous correlations in the field of
inertial and gyroscopic drives from researchers such as Dean, Cook,
Laithwaite, Kidd and Thornsen among others.

One must realize that there is a difference between an inertial drive such as
promoted by Dean, Cook and Thornsen and the precession effects of gyroscopic
drives as investigated by Laithwaite and Kidd.  In the case of inertial
drives, the ideal system involves the creation of a cycloid motion, currently
achieved by a complex mechanical rotation of one or more spinning weights.

The simplest form is a spring with a weight attached to the end of it and
mounted on a rotating disk.  You can see how the weighted spring can be
released at the same point in the rotation of the disk to give a hopping
action in a single preferred direction.

The spring slowly pulls the weight closer to the shaft as the disk spins away
from the direction of the hopping motion, this allows the spring to 'recharge'
during each rotation.  The device then moves in short hops only in one
preferred direction through the inertia of the moving weight when it is
released at the same point during the disk rotation.

In the case for gyroscopic precession, a perpendicular motion in relation to
the angular spin of the gyroscope will also produce a lifting force against
the weight of the gyroscope.  The claims are that weight is not eliminated but
reduced from its norm.  It is felt that further research along this line will
yield a levitating device.

But the reason I'm writing about this, is because of a fascinating discovery
made in Russia by Alexander Chernetski and tentatively called the PLASMATRON.
In our past meetings we have discussed MagnetoHydroDynamics (MHD) and the
possibilities it presented as an over-unity device.  An ionized gas that was
'supercharged' with high density magnetic flux seems to exhibit certain
properties which Chernetskii claims to take advantage of.  His description of
the process;

 "The self-generating discharge (SGD) emerges when the discharge current
  reaches a definite critical density, when the magnetic fields they create
  ensure magnetisation of plasma electrons and they begin to perform MOSTLY
  CYCLOID movements.  The interaction of currents with their magnetic fields
  forces the electrons to deviate to the cylinder-shaped discharge axis and
  the electrical field emerges.  It has proved to 'switch on' the physical
  vacuum; in this field the vacuum is polarized and consequently the virtual
  pairs begin to move IN A DEFINITE DIRECTION, instead of chaotically.  The
  current in the circuit builds up and additional energy is discharged on the
  resistor (that is) switched into the discharge circuit (load).  Clearly,
  only part of the tremendous vacuum energy is extracted."

Note if you will, once the cycloid pattern is achieved, a specific direction
of thrust is generated to force all loose electrons to be thrown off at
whatever happens to be in its path, in the Chernetskii case, an energy
collector absorbs the energy and then switches out the excess energy to a
load, such as a motor, light bulb or other device that performs a useful
service.  So, this is the same process as the inertial drive, except instead
of using the rotation of a MECHANICAL part, we are using the spinning of the
plasma, and instead of a weight, we are using a magnetic flux of a CRITICAL
DENSITY.

John Keely referred to the use of an apsidal motion as a means of crude
propulsion as far back as 1893 and used it to PROPEL his airship in a
demonstration to the War Department in 1896.  Levitation is one thing,
propulsion is quite another.  Once you understand how the cycloid motion can
be used in any rotating mass to produce a linear thrust, you can then extend
it into microscopic reaches to help explain phenomena that borders on magic.

Are not all molecules made up of atoms?  And are those atoms not in turn made
up of electrons spinning around a heavier nucleus?  So, if you could put a
dimple in the orbit of the electron in such a way that it would produce a
minute off balance thrust, you would get a slight deflection as if you pinched
a watermelon seed between your finger and it shot out.  Of course, the amount
of deflection will be very slight but can be amplified by adding to the
'weight' of the electron by increasing it's density.  When it is released at
the maximum eccentric position of the orbit, an inertial thrust is produced.

Keely said that a mass could be differentiated and essentially tuned so that
all components of it would become harmonized to each other.  Once this was
done, they all act as little tuning forks.  Because they are so tuned, you can
change the rotation or properties of one and THEY ALL CHANGE simultaneously.
Thus, you could dimple one electron and all others would also dimple IN THE
SAME DIRECTION to produce a MASS THRUST.  You then have a way of moving mass
without needing a transmission, something to react against or any visible
means of driving it beyond the circuitry necessary to create the effect.  This
could lead to all kinds of new technologies if it could be realized as a prime
mover.  As you can see, the applications of the cycloid motion are manifold
and ripe for further research.

A friend from Houston sent a gift in the form of a book called 'The Celestine
Prophecy".  It offers some unique insights into what is going on with our
modern world and the many odd convergences that we are all being affected by.
Not only are we at the end of the century but also at the end of a millenium
or thousand year cycle.  The book is about an ancient Manuscript that was
discovered in Peru and translated.  It revealed information so shocking that
governments and religious organizations were doing all they could to surpress
it.  It entailed a total of 9 Insights into the nature of man and the nature
of the Universe, why we are here and how everything works together for a
specific purpose.  I have not gotten past the 6th Insight, so can't say much
more about it, but the book is written in such an informative way, that you
will also find it very hard to put down.  It appears to be fiction but the
forward says it relied on many people for the information in the book.  If you
can get a copy, I HIGHLY recommend it.  It was published in 1993 so should be
easy to find.

Got a call from a fellow out in Florida who has been working with a psychic to
locate various treasure sites, ranging from buried treasure on land to sunken
ships.  He says his group is having great success and recommended reading the
book "The Alexandria Project" so I could understand how they worked.  Though
the book is long out of print, a quick trip to Half Price books at Greenville
and Northwest and coincidentally enough, there was the very book I needed to
read! (The Celestine Prophecy would claim this as indicative of an Insight,
things happen via the principle of CONVERGENCE, when you are open and needful
of information or help in the form of a beneficial event, it will 'manifest',
I'm telling ya, it's a POWERFUL BOOK!)

He says he's been working with a psychic who can touch an article, photo or
whatever and pull information from it, even to the point of being able to
converse with people that might be portrayed or described in the information.
Yes, this is psychometry but to be able to make BIG money from it???

The psychic says time is NOT AT ALL SERIAL like we imagine it, but instead all
things COEXIST with each other, using the same physical locations but with
different activities going on in each depending on which TIME PERIOD our
consciousness is aware of.  In this way, you can shift your consciousness
directly to the time period you want to visit or view for any given location.
What a bizarre thought, but this fellow seems to be able to get information on
subjects that just can't be gotten any other way.

Do you remember the FARROW levitating box that was included in a mailer
several months ago?  The psychic read a copy of the original 1911 article and
said he COULD SEE the box lying in an attic TODAY and that he knew where the
family lived.  The location of the family was verified and they were
contacted.  Sure enough, they did have an eccentric inventor uncle who left
some of his inventions.  Most were simple, like a tent or mechanical device,
but one they could not figure out.  It was still in the attic and was a wooden
box, just as the psychic described, obviously hand made and nailed shut. There
were some electrical 'things' attached to the top of the box. My contact
arranged to visit this family and see the machine, with an eye to opening or
photographing the insides of the box.  If this is the same FARROW box that is
seen freely levitating in the same pictures we have, then this could be a
major discovery, especially if it can be made to work or duplicated.

One other point, he says the psychic visited Coral Castle that was built by Ed
Leedskalnin and that much new information came about as a result.  For one,
there used to be wires strung over the entire castle but they were taken down
when the military base was established there.  The coral used was a form
of something called 'oolite' (sp) and that when a certain kind of acid was
applied to this along with an electric signal, the coral would LOSE WEIGHT.
However, if not carefully controlled, the coral would explode in a very
dangerous fashion.  The odd thing, this ONLY occurs AT THIS geographical
latitude and longitude just as Bruce Cathie's Grid Harmonics predicts.  When a
sample of this coral was taken to other areas, nothing happened.  He also says
that recently, the well on the property was lowered to reveal a secret room.
Inside that room were several devices, one of which was a WWII transmitter,
the other some odd kind of barrel or piston driven electro-mechanical
oscillator.  It is believed that the wires and circuits seem to be related to
Leedkalnins ability to lift the stones by himself.  One final point,
Leedkskalnin was no genius.  The psychic says Leedskalnin had worked with a
very advanced scientist in Europe before he came to the United States and
during that time, he had picked up certain ideas and techniques which he later
used in the building of the Coral Castle.  No doubt he was a careful observer
of Nature as well, but beyond that, he was just an ordinary man who'd had an
opportunity to work with a genius.  Well, that's about it for this notice,
just some of what has transpired since the last meeting....see ya there!

                        VACUUM ENERGY: A BREAKTHROUGH?

[heading]

By Andrei Samokhin

The model of a plasma generator which can convert physical-vacuum energy into
electricity has been developed under Prof.  Alexander CHERNETSKI at the Moscow
Georgi Plekhanov Institute of the National Economy.  Such generators could lay
the groundwork for the future environmentally-benign power industry.

[text]

Classical physics cannot explain what happens when a plasma discharger placed
in the Chernetski circuit is started: for no apparent reason the ammeter
pointer shows triple strength-of-current increase [sic] and energy output is
several times above input.  The plant's efficiency is much more than 1.

No magic is intended.  Additional energy outputs at specific plasma discharges
are fixed in several independent expert reports by the Lenin All-Union
Institute of Electrical Engineering.  This effect has been checked using
different methods.

Whence this mysterious energy?

Self-generating discharge
-------------------------

Prof Chernetski, author of the first-ever study paper on plasma diagnostics
equipment (he has been in this field for 40 years now) and 20 inventions,
never knew what probing into specific unstable plasma states at strong-current
discharges could have led to.  In the early 70s, he and fellow-researcher Yuri
Galkin worked on a basically new type of high-frequency plasma generator which
could at high power do without unwieldy energy converters.  In one test, they
discovered a decided input-to-output energy gap. [sic]

"I knew electron drift begins in plasma and sought to deduce a combination of
variables in which fluctuating plasma instability emerged in discharge,"
Chernetski says.  "Gas discharge was meant to serve as a powerful stimulator
of electromagnetic modes and, all of a sudden and in defiance of the law of
conservation of energy, a strange energy IMBALANCE was produced.  Repeated
experiments with different circuits proved energy output to be ALWAYS GREATER
than input."

The mysterious discharge stimulating additional energy extraction was called
the "self generating discharge (SGD)".  Measurements showed that part of the
discharge power went back into the network as if two series-connected
electromotive forces were at work.

In a bid to try to explain the experimental data, the researchers actually
tried to prove the impossible.  One of their proofs was very "strong".  The
one-megawatt substation of the Moscow Aviation Institute, where Chernetski and
Galkin were staging an experiment with a powerful plasma unit, burned out.

When the discharge currents reached criticality, superstrong current was
"born" in the generator and went back into the network, playing havoc with the
safety devices calculated for short-circuit.  Later on, they read in books
that earlier in the century the power plant of prominent Yugoslav electrical
engineer Nikola Tesla caught fire under similar circumstances in the United
States.  Chernetski and Galkin were sure that Tesla was making such
experiments, but did not publish the results.  They are also sure that vacuum
energy can explain this mysterious effect.

A vacuum-Powered Lamp

The researchers relied on the present-day quantum physics idea of "zero-point
oscillations" in physical vacuum.  Such oscillations signifying the birth and
annihilation of virtual pairs -- the particle and anti-particle, distinguished
from the normal elementary particles by a negligibly short life, a mere
8.10/-21[sic] sec.  Emerging BELOW the zero energy level from "nothing" and
returning to "nothing", these virtual particles appeared to defy the law of
conservation of energy.

Quantum electrodynamics explains this paradox through the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle.  Under it all the precise particle characteristics
cannot be learned simultaneously and, therefore, one must not require from
nature "punctual" abidance by the law during such a short time as the life of
virtual pairs.  The observer fails to notice anything, while every virtual
pair is more than real, carrying an energy of more than half a million
electron-volts during its lifetime.  The potential energy in the electric bulb
vacuum is enough to boil the earth's oceans, Americans John Wheeler and
Richard Feynman have calculated.

Until recently the vacuum energy idea was only a daring hypothesis bordering
on science-fiction.  The lamp powered by vacuum in Chernetski's basememt
laboratory in the center of Moscow made it a reality.

This is how he explains his miraculous experiment: "The self-generating
discharge emerges when the discharge current reaches a definite critical
density, when the magnetic fields they create ensure magnetization of plasma
electrons and they begin to perform MOSTLY CYCLOID movements.  The interaction
of currents with their magnetic fields forces the electrons to deviate to the
CYLINDER-SHAPED discharge axis and the electrical field emerges.  It has
proved to 'switch on' the physical vacuum: in this field the vacuum is
polarized and consequently the virtual pairs begin to move in a definite
direction, instead of chaotically.

The virtual positrons accelerate plasma electrons, giving them part of their
energy.  The current in the circuit builds up and additional energy is
discharged on the resistor switched into the discharge circuit.  Clearly, only
part of the tremendous vacuum energy is extracted.

"We've developed several circuit versions which can find application.  In the
later experiment with an input power of 700 watts, the energy extracted by the
generator load resistance was three kilowatts, or nearly five times more.
This is by far not the limit and with more powerful plants and the
corresponding calculations; megawatts of free electricity can be produced from
a minimal power source."

Self-Generating-Discharge Plasmatron and Space Travel

Yuri Galkin looks at the future of their discovery: "Its applications are
wide-ranging.  For example, engines can be developed, based on the self-
generating-discharge plasmatron.  Until now all attempts to use plasmatrons as
engines have failed, because strong electron and ion bombardments rapidly
burnt out the electrodes.  Self-generating discharge leaves them intact and
such engines can be used in aircraft, trains and autos.  It would be logical
to create a new environmentally-wise power industry.  Portable hydros, wind
power plants and solar batteries boosted by self-generating discharge could
become an enormous source of electricity.  With time, they could edge out the
costly and hazardous fuel-firing and hydraulic [hydroelectric?] facilities.

Already now we can build a plant which would supply electricity for a township
or factory.  A vacuum power station comparable to giant facilities could be
designed today.  Our discovery can revolutionize cosmonautics."

Laboratory experiments have proved the possibility of using the KINETIC EFFECT
of self-generating discharge for accelerating bodies in space.  Galkin has
calculated the parameters of a self-generating-discharge plasmatron that could
serve as the propulsion engine of the future, replacing the present unwieldy
rocket engines.  Powered by a minor TEN-VOLT SOURCE, it can deliver power
enough for the takeoff of a large spaceship.  Tapping the ambient space
vacuum, it could fly eternally.

Unknown Waves

"We didn't think of only industrial applications," Chernetski recalls.  "Self-
generating discharge turned out to produce wave radiation which was hitherto
unknown, but evidently existent at all times.  Like sound waves, its waves
have a longitudinal electric field component and a high penetrability through
conductive mediums, including metals.  It turned out that these single waves,
work to 'awaken' the hidden vacuum energy and can alter the structure of
substances.  "The experiment staged at the Burdenko Institute of Neurosurgery
in Moscow several years ago showed that directional SGD radiation accelerated
nuclear beta-decomposition by 5%-6%.  This is only one example.

We supposed that, like SGD-generator radiation, longitudinal electric-field
component waves could also be produced by living beings, man in particular.
Comparative experiments were staged to prove the impact on men with
extrasensory perception and of our device on different objects.  In both cases
parallel impact on the high-stability quartz generator made its frequency
'drift' by several orders of magnitude.  The filament resistance of the
incandescent lamp decreased considerably.  Probably we are on the road to
explaining such mysterious things as extrasensory perception, telekinesis and
bioenergy.

Vacuum-Ether

The experimentally-verified concept of Chernetski claims to be a theoretical
breakthrough in the basic quantum-physics idea of the energy structure of the
Universe.  It is generally recognised among physicists that all elementary
particle interactions, and hence every existing phenomenon, occur with the
help of virtual-particle exchange.  How does it come about?

"Full annihilation of virtual pairs cannot take place in the event of partial
energy extraction in self-generating discharge, because a 'certain' virtual
dipole must emerge -- two separate charges with a common negative energy.
This means that together with energy extraction vacuum structurisation and
ordering takes place.

Actually, our concept is a return to the idea of the universal ether at an
entirely new level.  We say that the ordered dipole vacuum, or ether, is an
all-penetrating energy medium in which processes occur which are related to
virtual dipoles and subject to the uncertainty principle of modern physics."

Chernetski asks: if vacuum structurisation is a constant process, isn't this
an opportunity to state the law of conservation of entropy in the Universe in
opposition to the idea of its steadfast decrease?

What if this work helps to clear up the nature of gravitation, which is as dim
now as it was in the times of Newton?  What his concept of the vacuum shows
the road to the long-awaited explanation of the Grand Unification theory?

"As as experimental physicist I won't say our theory is 100 percent correct,"
Chernetski declares.  "It's much more an opportunity now to have indisputable
experimental data to prove the opportunity of creating a basically new power
industry."

Only a rapid switch to new energy can save human civilisation from ecological
catastrophe.  The research program must be developed immediately and a center
set up to coordinate cooperation between world scientists.  Natural and
unlimited vacuum energy is at our doorstep.

Hi David!

I left you an extensive note that was lost when the computer crashed on me.
Your post is fascinating and the first I've seen where ANYBODY besides
Laithwaite had been working on gyroscopic precession.  Harold Aspden and Eric
Laithwaite had done an experiment where Laithwaite held a rapidly spinning
disk.  The disk was mounted on free spinning bearings on a shaft.  The shaft
was held horizontally while the disk was made to rotate at high speed...the
shaft was then lifted at which it prescribed an arc to one side.  Stop action
photos of this arc showed it to be roughly 32.7 degrees which just happens to
be that of the DNA helix.  Aspden suggests this to be a major angle used by
nature and which might be applicable to free energy/anti-grav experiments.

Joe Newman also has found that a gyroscopic precession has free energy
applications as he explains in his theories about how his invention works.

The 'Dynabee' wrist exerciser you mention is something I never have heard
about, wonder if there is a patent on it with some details?

Possibly worth looking up....I have a video of the Sandy Kidd device from a
short segment done by Beyond 2000.  It does not free levitate but is shown
suspended from a ceiling loop and attached to a bucket with a counter weight.
He uses a small radio plane gas motor to provide the rotation and it does
appear to 'walk' upwards, though it could very well just be due to linear
friction...

Well, just wanted to thank you for the intriguing post with the details, I
don't have anything like it on KeelyNet, particularly in the form of a .GIF
file to clealy show what is going on, but I think it correlates nicely with
the Cook/Thornsen inertial (unidirectional) drive.  Thornsen actually
propelled a canoe across a lake at up to 82 feet per minute, with nothing
touching the water, no propeller, etc...simply this jerking force...the claim
is it is reactionless and with a better design and more power, it could
provide upward thrust...

I added your name to my address book in case anything turns up in this area, I
think it is incredibly useful and important and if you could do some kind of
.GIF or something it might inspire a lot of people to get more into this area
of research....I will check out the patent archives at the Dallas library and
see if there is anything on the Dynabee or wrist excercisers in
general.....thanks again..>>> Jerry/KeelyNet/Dallas (214) 324-3501
