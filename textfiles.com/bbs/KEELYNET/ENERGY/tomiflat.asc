Introduction:

I have been experimenting and conducting research in alternative sciences for
a number of years. For the last few years I have concentrated mainly on
alternative, or as it was most commonly known, 'free', energy research as the
results of such research have far reaching consequences for the future of the
world as we know it and may decide if we have a future or not.

I share the views of most other independant researchers who do not have a
vested interest financially in the results of their research and are of the
belief that only full disclosure of all of our results can prevent any
suppression of this technology that has been taking place for so long.

From a very young age I was always interested in electronics and have built
a great many devices of my own design. It started becoming apparent to me,
whilst studying for my diploma in electronics, that what I was being taught
was established electrical and physical principles that had been worked out
a great many decades ago and all I was being taught was updated uses of what
was basically old science.

It wasn't to long after beginning my research into alternative sciences that
the reasons for this became all to apparent. I do not wish to bore you with
the ignorant politics of the suppression that has been taking place as I am
sure you would be aware of it already. I believe the best way to beat the
suppression is to share the results so that others may duplicate and further
develop the technology and not try to selfishly look to the gain of ones self
at the expense of preventing the gain to a great many.

One of the most important aspects of any device is its simplicity and the
ability for others to duplicate it and its claimed results. One of the best
I've seen so far that meets this requirement is the TOMI device or Theory Of
Magnetic Instability device to which I commend the inventor. This is one such
device that any body new to the new energy seen should build as it definately
shows them something that works and further inspires one to take a serious
look into this type of research.

The purpose of this text is to give to all, my results and modifications to
the TOMI device in its linear form so that it is much simpler to duplicate.

If this is the first time you've heard of the TOMI device, whilst reading
this text, I suggest that you first read the original and other previous
texts written on the device by the inventor (Stewart Harris of Las Vegas) and
his associates.  (see TMIDEVIC, TOMIBILD, TOMIMOTR, & MAGSPIN on KeelyNet)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Flat Linear TOMI Device

After reading and duplicating the original TOMI device, I was intrigued by
the need to have a track that consisted of ramps of inclination and
declination although at the time I percieved that one of the requirements
for the device to work was for it to utilise both gravitation and magnetic
anomalies.

After considerable experimentation I found that I was able to completly do
away with the gravitational component of the device, which held the need for
ramps of inclination and declination, and have a device that was completely
driven by the magnetic anomally itself on a completely flat horizontal linear
track of unlimited length. This makes duplication of the device and the result
almost foolproof.

All one needs to make this version of the device is a stack of button magnets
(I used the round holeless ferrite type- 10mm diameter by 5 mm thick), a role
of double sided tape, a little bit of masking tape and a flat table top. There
is no need to make any special ramped track as the table top is used for your
flat track.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Construction

First make the roller. This is the same as described in the original TOMI
device text and consists of 7 to 10 magnets of the same polar direction stuck
together in a role and held together with a bit of masking tape.

Next lay two parallel and straight lines of double sided tape on the table
top. The distance between the two lines of tape should be the length of roller
plus 1.5 to 2 inches. Peel off the top of the double sided tape and now you
are ready for the most important part, the laying of the track magnets.

This is the most important and unique part that I have developed, which lets
the device work on a flat linear track. The track magnets are not stuck
together but are individually seperated by a gap or shall I say a gap of two
different distances.

Place the magnets one by one on the first line of double sided tape all in
the same polar direction with the polar axis parallel to the tape. In between
the magnets leave a gap of a certain length and then a gap of double the
length for every alternate gap. The gap distance I used for the type of
magnets I had was 5 mm and 10 mm respectively. This alternation of gap
distance is the key to continuous operation on a flat horizontal track.

The gap distance or the fact that one is double the other is not crucial and
is variable. What is crucial is the alternation of the gap distances because
if they were all the same distance, the propulsive magnetic anomally will only
occur at the beginning and the end of the track limiting the length of the
track, this is why a ramped track was necessary in the original TOMI device.

When two alternate gap distances are used, the propulsive anomally is present
throughout the length of the track allowing an unlimited length of track that
is flat and horizontal although it may work on a constant incline of which
depends on the propulsion strength.

To complete construction place another row of magnets on the other line of
double sided tape except the polarities must be opposite that of the first
line of magnets and parallel to the length of the track. Make sure that the
magnets line up perpendicular to the length and in line with the magnets on
the other line of tape.

Now that you have finished the track all you have to do is place the roller
anywhere in the track (perpendicular to the length of the track of course)
and it will roll in its appropriate polar direction till it reaches the end
of the track. The roller may be turned over swapping its own polar direction
and you will find it will also roll in the opposite direction till it reaches
the end of the track.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I also recommend people who have duplicated this device, try and develop it
into some form of rotary rotor type orientation which in effect will make it a
permanent magnet motor requiring now input energy.

I am continuing in this direction myself though at present I make no claims to
having done so and personally do not release any results of my research until
I have a working model myself.

I recommend anyone researching the field of alternate energy to make this
device as I feel that a duplicatable working device is worth a thousand
theories.
