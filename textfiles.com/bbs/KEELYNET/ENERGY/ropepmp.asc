                     From Popular Science, June 1951, page 77
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       The following article  piqued  our interest since we always look for
       low tech ways of achieving what  most  think  REQUIRES  the  use  of
       motors.  It is one of the fallacies of modern thought  that work can
       ONLY be accomplished by relatively complex devices.

       In most ways,  rotary  motion  is  more efficient, yet requires more
       complicated attachments.  So what  if the techinque of accomplishing
       takes a bit  more  energy,  it  uses  less parts and  is  much  more
       reliable as well as being ecologically safe.

       Note that rotary  motion  pumps  still  require impellers, seals and
       custom made chambers, while the following  technique requires only 3
       components, 1) motor, 2) rope, 3) pulley.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

                                 Rope Lifts Water
                                 Without a Bucket

       Now you can pump water with clothesline -

                          NO pipes, NO valves, NO buckets

       - just ordinary rope clothesline sent spinning around  pulleys  by a
       motor.  Two University  of Illinois professors are already doing it,
       raising 12 gallons a minute about  25 feet.  It's not a trick.  They
       foresee many uses for such a cheap, easy-to-rig pump.

       The clothesline just races down and up through the  water at 40 feet
       per second - the speed imparted by a 6-inch pulley at 1,750 r.p.m.

       As the rope  comes  up, friction makes a quarter-inch layer of water
       stick to it.  The water is thrown  off  into  a chute by centrifugal
       force when the rope speeds over the top pulley.

       The reason it  works is the same reason you'd have  trouble  running
       down an UP  escalator.  The water is always pouring down the upbound
       rope, but so long as the rope moves  up  faster than the water moves
       down, the rope wins and water is pumped.

       Actually, rope pumps  are  centuries  old.   Professors   Henry   L.
       Langhaar and William  M.  Owen  ran  across mention of one in an old
       book on hydraulics.  The author didn't think much of the idea, and

                                      Page 1





       neither did the  professors.   But  they  tried  it  -  at  a  total
       expenditure of 98 cents for 100 feet  of  clothesline.   The  1/4 HP
       motor and pulleys were found in the laboratory.  (lying around, thus
       no special purchase)

       To their surprise, it worked amazingly well.  Some  water drops back
       through the rope holes, but this is a minor loss.  Since there seems
       to be NO  LIMIT TO THE HEIGHT of lift, they think it could do almost
       any job, such as raising water for livestock.

       Vangard Note...

           An excellent way of thinking of  this  is that of a Van De Graff
           machine.  If  you  are  familiar  with  this  device,  you  will
           instantly find   the   analogy   helpful.   For  those  who  are
           unfamiliar with  the operation  of  a  Van  De  Graff,  a  short
           description follows :

                Van De Graff Electrostatic Generators use  a  motor, a belt
                with the  ability  to  hold electrostatic charges, a pulley
                and an accumulator.

                The motor  spins at a high  rate  of  speed  to  cause  the
                charged belt to move through a column and  throw  off loose
                static charges.   These  charges  are  centrifugally thrown
                into the inside of an accumulator  which  allows the charge
                to build up on the outside surface.

           This principle  is  the same as the Rope Pump,  though  using  a
           different form of energy.

           In the    accumulation/replenishment   of   energy   (water   or
           electricity), the  primary   question   is   HOW   MUCH  can  be
           accumulated/replenished and over WHAT TIME FRAME?

           Modern times  emphasizes rushing around and the  hurry-up  idea.
           As a  result,  we  think everything should happen instantly.  We
           can attribute  this  partly to  the  many  interests  of  modern
           society and events which constantly draw ones' attention.  Thus,
           we try to cram whatever we can into our available time.

           When times were slower, accumulation of energy  over  long  time
           periods was accepted as the normal course of things.  The actual
           use of  the  accumulated  energy  is  over  a  relatively  short
           duration so the buildup can again resume to the maximum level of
           the storage chamber.

           This simple idea applies to electricity,  magnetism,  gas, fluid
           or any other form of matter/energy and is really  determined  by
           the method  of storage.  Indeed, in a plenum of matter or energy
           the challenge  is  to  come up  with  a  means  of  storing  the
           abundance of   matter/energy   into   higher  potentials   (i.e.
           PUMPING.)

           Of course, this also could be applied to creating a lower energy
           potential which  would  draw from the surrounding environment to
           create a well of negativity.   In seeking equilibrium, either of
           these flows can be made to do work.

                                      Page 2





           So, for immediate concerns we should consider ways of optimizing
           the rope transfer rate.

              1)  A  spongy  texture  would  allow  more  absorption  and a
                  squeegee device  attached  at  the  dumping  stage  would
                  greatly increase the transfer.

              2)  A  polarized material with small cups parallel  with  the
                  length of  the  rope  and  all  facing the same direction
                  would also increase the transfer.

              3)  Multiple ropes to increase the flow.

           The interesting thing about simple  files  like this one is that
           it enables  one  to  appreciate and understand  simple  concepts
           which easily  apply  to  all  the  complexities  of free energy,
           levitation, etc...

           When you consider Zero Point  Energy  and  how to "milk" it from
           the surrounding energy environment, you realize  that since work
           is derived  from tapping into a difference in potential AND that
           the energy environment is relatively  constant,  then  you  must
           create a  "well"  of  high or low energy density  of  a  greater
           accumulated magnitude  than  formal  ZPE  as occurs on the micro
           levels.

           Since formal ZPE involves the  jitter effect from an essentially
           infinite number  of micro energy fluctuations  in  random  (ha!)
           patterns, then a large scale Jitter might be artifically created
           to be tapped for useable "coherent/DC" energy.

           Yes, I  know, this appears to be off the topic of the paper, but
           in truth it is not.  The idea  is  applicable across wide areas.
