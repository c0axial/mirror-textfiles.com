       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       A few months back, we got a call from a friend who had heard of this
       incredible motor that  was  said  to  run itself and generate excess
       useable power.  The details were unclear  at the time and our friend
       gathered more details and we met for lunch to discuss  what  he  had
       found out.  A  scanned  image  of the machine as it was described to
       him with those details will be included  in CLEM2.ZIP (when I get it
       done).  It is NOW done and is CLEM1.GIF, bundled as CLEM2.ZIP.

       As we understand it, inventor Richard Clem died of  a  heart  attack
       soon after the  deal was signed with the coal company.  His workshop
       was raided by  law  enforcement officials  and  all  his  notes  and
       drawings were removed.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       The story as I was told by our unnamed friend :

       A local man  (Dallas)  developed  a  closed system engine  that  was
       purported to generate  350  HP  and  run itself.  The engine weighed
       about 200 pounds and ran on cooking oil at temperatures of 300 F.

       It consisted of a cone mounted on  a  horizontal  axis.   The  shaft
       which supported the  cone  was  hollow and the cone  had  spiralling
       channels cut into  it.   These  spiralling pathways wound around the
       cone terminating at the cone base in the form of nozzles (rimjets).

       When fluid was pumped into the hollow  shaft  at  pressures  ranging
       from 300-500 PSI (pounds per square inch), it moved  into the closed
       spiralling channels of  the  cone and exited from the nozzles.  This
       action caused the  cone to spin.   As  the  velocity  of  the  fluid
       increased, so did the rotational speed of the cone.

       As the speed continued to increase, the fluid heated up, requiring a
       heat exchange and  filtering  process.  At a certain  velocity,  the
       rotating cone became  independent  of  the drive system and began to
       operate of itself.  The engine ran at speeds of 1800 to 2300 RPM.

       Immediately after the inventor had  the  heart attack and the papers
       were removed, the son of the inventor took the only working model of
       the machine to  a farm near Dallas.  There it was  buried  under  10
       feet of concrete  and  has  been  running  at that depth for several
       years.

       In later conversations, our contact  says the engine had been tested
       by Bendix Corporation.  The test involved attaching the engine to a


                                      Page 1





       dynamometer to measure  the  amount  of  horsepower generated by the
       engine in its self-running mode.

       It generated a  consistent  350 HP  for  9  consecutive  days  which
       astounded the engineers at Bendix.  They concluded  the  only source
       of power which  could  generate  this  much power in a CLOSED SYSTEM
       over an extended period must be of an atomic nature.

       Construction of the engine was from  off the shelf components except
       for the hollow  shaft and the custom cone with the  enclosed  spiral
       channels.

       Richard Clem worked  with heavy machinery for the city of Dallas and
       had noticed that certain kinds of  high  pressure pumps continued to
       run for short  periods after the power was removed.   His  curiosity
       into this phenomenon led to the development of the Clem Engine.

                    The following is from a newspaper clipping.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                             The Clem Over-Unity Motor

       In 1972, Richard  Clem  announced  the invention of a way to operate
       automobile engines on cooking oil.

       He's still making that claim today,  even though his first prototype
       motor fell apart  and  he had been "strung along"  by  at  least  15
       companies before he found financial backing.

       Clem, 48, a  heavy  equipment  operator  for  the city of Dallas and
       part-time inventor, says  if  the  automobile  industry  adopts  his
       invention, motorists could change the eight gallons of vegetable oil
       only every 150,000 miles and never buy any gas.

       Clem said he  uses  vegetable  oil  because his motor  runs  at  300
       degrees - a temperature where water has boiled away and conventional
       motor oil breaks  down.  Though he won't divulge many details of the
       engine, a 12-volt battery apparently  is  the  only  other source of
       power.

       When Clem finished his first vegetable oil engine in 1972, he mapped
       a 600-mile test trip to El Paso for the first engine  model  he  had
       financed through his  earnings.   But  he  only  made  it  as far as
       Abilene before the "shafts and everything bent in it."

       He blamed the failure on poor construction,  too  small  a shaft and
       the use of chains instead of gears.  Undaunted, he  decided  to  try
       again, but said, "I needed money to build this thing better."

       Neither the automobile  industry nor the 15 other companies he wrote
       - some as  far  away as Taiwan -  were  interested  in  financing  a
       prototype and then manufacturing it.

       Then last year, he said, a large coal company offered  to  back him.
       Clem refused to disclose the name of his benefactor, but did say the
       coal company had  signed  contracts  to  sell  the  engines to power
       companies for use in pulling turbines.

       Clem said he expects to finish work  on the motor by the end of this
       year.  (1972)

       Vangard Note..

            The above  article  was reported as being generated from Flower
            Mound, Texas  (northwest  of   Dallas   and   slightly   beyond
            Carrollton).  I called the only Clem listed in  the  book as of
            11/20/92 and  they  knew of no other Clem in that area, nor did
            they know of any Richard Clem or his family.

            Two separate visits to the patent section of the Dallas Library
            have not yielded any patents  by  a  Richard Clem involving any
            type of engine.  We are still pursuing for more details.

            As of 12/26/92, I drew up a .GIF file called CLEM1.GIF  that is
            bundled with  this  file  under the name CLEM2.ZIP.  It gives a
            better understanding of how  the  machine  was  constructed, at
            least as it was described to us.

            For those who study such matters, one immediately sees the tie-
            ins with Boundary Layer Drag principles as evinced  in  much of
            Tesla's work.   We  have  noted  something  odd  about spinning
            masses in that at specific velocities,  strange  things  occur.
            The velocities at which phenomena occur are  dependent  on  the
            resonant frequencies  of  the  mass as an aggregate, exactly as
            Keely said.

            The Clem  system  was said to  be  built  with  off  the  shelf
            components.  The most complicated piece of the  entire  machine
            was the  cone.  And based on Boundary layer drag, it would seem
            that the cone was unnecessary.   The  question  with  the  Clem
            device is "Does the extended surface area of  the  cone  add to
            the rotational velocity of the cone, yielding greater pressures
            through centrifugal  force or would flat plates as in the TESLA
            turbine be sufficient to generate the same effect?".

            We continue to look for further  information on this device and
            appreciate your comments or supporting material.
