       Folder : A, "Public Mail"

       We all should thank Joel McLain for finding the 4TH State of Matter
       book and sharing it with us.  I have read the file with a great deal
       of interest since  I  have  been  in  the  past,  and  am  currently
       researching a plasma based system of over-unity power production.

       The KeelyNet was established for the purpose of sharing this type of
       information and provides a channel  of  comments,  observations  and
       often critique.  A sort of peer review on a friendly basis.  The MHD
       application referred to in the 4THSTATE.ASC file  is  not  an  over-
       unity device for  several  reasons  that  I  will go into in greater
       detail as we go along.

       First, the MHD generator produced 30 Megawatts of which 10 Megawatts
       was plowed back into the device to  maintain  the necessary magnetic
       flux densities in  the copper coils.  Nothing is said  in  the  text
       about the energy expenditure needed to heat the plasma nor propel it
       through the flux field to produce a current.

       When we talk  about  the advantages of using superconducting magnets
       in this type of application we must  take  into  account  the  TOTAL
       ENERGEY OUTLAY to determine if we have an over-unity application.

       All we hear  about the Super Conducting Super Collider  is  that  it
       uses cryogenic cooled  magnets  to  control and contain the particle
       path within the 52 mile ring.  Just  think  about  the fact that the
       Cryogenic system to achieve supercondtivity in the SSC would have
       cost over a  BILLON  dollars  for it is an intergral  part  of  each
       magnet section plus  there was going to be built on site the world's
       largest facility for the production  of  liquid  helium  and  liquid
       hydrogen which is the secondary coolant in the system.

       Extensive expense went  into the emergency venting  and  gas  escape
       system needed when the dreaded Quenching problem arises from time to
       time.  Quenching is  the  term  applied to the particle beam getting
       out of it's  containment  field  and  striking  the  magnetic  coils
       causing instant heating and cryogenic gas boiling and expansion

                                      Page 1





       which is the same as the explosive expansion of steam.

       When superconductivity is   mentioned   everyone  thinks  that  this
       phenomena is magical and occurs at no additional cost: WRONG .  The
       cryogenic cost of maintaining superconductivity must be entered into
       the over-unity equation if this is what we are trying to determine.

       If you are a GOVERNMENT project then  totally  disregard  all  these
       trivial expenses.  Do  you  realize  that the Commanche  Peak  Power
       station will cost  more than the SSC and eventually all utility rate
       payers will foot the entire expense through utility rate increases?

       I make the above comments from a very informed basis for in my files
       I have all  of  the  Patents that  apply  to  MHD  power  generation
       including the ones on Plasma MHD.  I also have all  the  Patents  on
       Hot Fussion using  Plasma.   Due  to on line time constraints I will
       share with everyone  some  interesting   experiments   that  I  have
       conducted with MHD in a subsequent message.

       Again, thank you Joel for sharing the 4th State info with us. Your
       friend Norm.

       Sure thing, Norm.   I've always enjoyed  our  conversations,  and  I
       admire the work you're doing.  Some of the other MENTOR  books  also
       might have some  interesting  info, as well, and if I can track them
       down, I'll upload reviews of them as well.

       Hard to say how much MHD has progressed  in  the past 20+ years, but
       I'd guess it's on-line in quite a few places where  cameras  are NOT
       allowed.  CUL (see you later)

       Hi again, Norm.

       I just finished   reading   your  message  at  greater  length,  and
       hopefully, with more understanding.  So, I want to ask your opinion.


                                      Page 2





       I've been solidly  of  the opinion (also from experiments of my own)
       that ANY form  of unity plus would  require  resonance.   The  CLEMM
       engine, which uses cooking oil with a turbine, is a good example.

       He pumped the  oil  until  the  turbine  speed  was   at   aggregate
       resonance, and the oil continued to flow by itself, propelled by the
       heat generated during  the pumping process.  One of these engines is
       still running around Dallas somewhere,  buried  so as to keep people
       from touching it.

       A MHD design  might  also  pump  the plasma to resonance,  and  then
       disconnect the pump/heater, and keep going in the same manner.  I'd
       GUESS that that  is  how  the  Mark  V  (or  its followers) work.  I
       haven't the means  to  build  a prototype  of  this,  but  it  seems
       reasonable.

       What do you think?   The book, as you noted, failed to mention the
       energy required to  maintain  the  pump/heater, but  they  may  have
       stumbled on the resonance principle, as Clemm did.
       CUL

       After a little prompting from Bert last night I will talk about the
       cold MHD experiment that I did several years ago.

       First a little background, I spent  30  years in the military during
       which time I  had  the  opportunity  to visit many  of  the  defense
       manufacturing and R&D  facilities  since  I was working with the R&D
       programs.  While we were working  on  the  ABM Sprint missile system
       back in the seventies I visited the Arnold wind tunnel, NASA Moffett
       Field and the  BRL Hypersonic facility, therefore  have  first  hand
       knowledge of them.

       During my stint  as Director of Research and Development for a large
       energy firm in the Smoky Mountains  (Ashville)  we  researched a low
       temp MHD system  that  would  work on a wood burning  or  gas  fired
       furnace for domestic application.  It was based on an Israeli patent
       for a solar fired freon media system that opperated at 180 F.

       Since high temps  are  really  NOT  necessary for the MHD process to
       work then it follows that maybe a cold process was possible.

       Several years ago I assembled all the parts and put together a table
       top MHD generator that was rather interesting.

       The combination occurred to me after  reading  Joseph Caters "Awsome
       Life Force" in which he differentiated the HARD electrons from SOFT
       electrons noting their different characteristics.

       D.C. Cox of Resonance Research filled me in on the difference

                                      Page 2





       between the soft  electrons that are generated by influence machines
       like Holts, Wimshurst  and other electrostatic  generators  and  the
       Vandegraff machine which  generates or accumulates  hard  electrons,
       since it is  an  ion  seeded  device VS stripping electrons out of a
       dielectric media (wimshurst).

       The Swiss ML  converter works on  the  principle  that  I  will  Now
       describe.

       I built a typical MHD generator channel which is like a venturi with
       a square cross section of one square inch on opposing  sides  of the
       square.  We place  a  North and South pole with approximately 50,000
       gauss magnetic flux density.

       At the adjacent sides of the square  we  have  the  current  pick-up
       plates, at low  temp  I  used  copper.  High  temp applications  use
       tungsten and ceramic construction.  I built a small wind tunnel that
       employed a turbo fan that moved the air around the closed circuit at
       a tremendous velocity.

       On the back  side  of the wind tunnel loop I placed an electrostatic
       grid sort of like a bug eater on which  I put an electostatic charge
       (soft electrons) to  be  picked  up  by my seed material  which  was
       SODIUM POTASSIUM TARTRATE  better  known to non-chemists as ROCHELLE
       SALT.

       By the way, ROCHELLE SALT is the most  electrically  active material
       known in scientific circles.  It can and does have the capability to
       carry tremendous  electrostatic charges.  When the electrostatically
       charged crystals are moved by the air currents through a very strong
       magnetic field the  electrons  are  stripped  out  of the flow at 90
       degrees to the magnetic poles an  are  deposited  as a + or positive
       charge on one  side  of the square and a - negative  charge  on  the
       opposite side of the square.

       With the turbo  fan  screaming  at  12,000  RPM,  dogs  barking, the
       neighbors watched as the meters jumped  off the scale with DC output
       at the pick-up terminals.  I made a long run of the device observing
       the relationship between  the electostatic input VS  the  dc  output
       when all of a sudden my fan made some god-awful noises caused by the
       fact that the  tartrate  crystal have a melting point of 170 F and I
       had exceeded this temp which literally  caused a meltdown within the
       fan.

       I dissassembled the device and tossed the fan into  the dumpster for
       it was totally   destroyed   with   melted   tartrate   crystal  (an
       intercooler would have helped here).  My neighbors asked what I had
       learned, to which I replied "A lot".

       D.C. Cox told me that Ion seeded devices such as Vandegraff machines
       accumulate hard electrons, therefore are very dangerous.  The output
       of these machines can kill you INSTANTLY, therefore he will not even
       sell plans for them.

       On the other hand, electrostatic  generators  work  by  accumulating
       soft electrons, therefore are harmless in the raw form.   Be careful
       for we now  have  an idea as to how to transform soft electrons into
       hard electrons in the form of DC  current  which  is  what is taking
       place in the Swiss ML converter.

       Basic MHD principles  are the key to this energy conversion.  Due to
       on line time constraints( JERRY,  ARE  YOU  READING ?) I have to end
       this session and pick up at a later date with the discussion of the
       CLEM N-MACHINE combo  since JOEL brought it up.   See  Jerry  has  a
       program called MESS-UP  which he is going to install that will allow
       us to word process messages at our leisure, them load them up to the
       board at 9600 baud which will give  us  all  more time to exchange a
       great deal of knowledge.  Thanks again to Joel, Bert  and  Jerry for
       their friendly support.  Your friend NORM.

       Vangard Note

          The following is a very short piece  regarding  an amazing energy
          device called  the MigMa.  It is being included  because  of  its
          claimed overunity output.

          A Bulgarian-born  American  physicist  named  Joseph  Maglich has
          invented and partially developed  an  atomic FUSION reactor which
          he calls "MigMa", which uses NON-radioactive deuterium  as a fuel
          (available in  nearly  UNlimited quantities from sea water), does
          NOT produce radioactive waste,  can  be  converted  DIRECTLY into
          electricity (without energy-wasting steam turbines),  and  can be
          constructed small  enough  to  power  a  house or large enough to
          power a city or spaceship.

          And UNlike the "Tokamaks" and laser  fusion monstrosities that we
          read about, MigMa WORKS, already producing at least  THREE  WATTS
          of power for every WATT PUT IN!
