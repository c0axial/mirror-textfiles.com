       Zero Point Energy is known as an energy that fills the fabric of all
       space.  Technically the ZPE results from an electric flux that flows
       orthogonally to our perceived dimension or reality.  The mass
       equivalence of this energy has been calculated by physicists to be
       on the order of 1093gms/cm3.

       Henry T.  Moray, Walter Russell, and Nikola Tesla described the
       nature of the ZPE and designed and built equipment to engineer its
       properties.  It may be possible to build devices to cohere this
       energy.  This would result in a nonpolluting, unlimited supply of
       virtually free energy.

       Vortex Mechanics are related to the mechanism in which ZPE results
       in the manifestation of matter in this dimension.  These
       interactions are also modeled in the physical universe in the
       actions of plant growth, the formation of mollusk shells, and
       tornados.  Vortices form matter, shape it and hold it together,
       guiding life's process by centripetally charging and feeding growth,
       then, centrifugally discharging it and throwing it back to its
       original essence.

       N-Machines are electromechanical devices related to homopolar
       generators.  Because there are experiments that can be done with
       these machines that bring up possible discrepancies between
       relativity theory and quantum mechanics, they are of interest to the
       alternative energy researcher.  There are inventors and researchers
       who have constructed these devices and have reported anomalous
       energy output including over unity operation.

       Gravitational Effects have been reported by a number of researchers
       working in the fields of high voltage electrostatics and dynamics,
       magnetics design, and in the operation of over unity devices.  The
       field of electrogravitics offers opportunity in advanced energy
       propulsion systems as well as the potential for aiding in the design
       of over unity devices.

       Magnetic Motors are mechanical devices which use the energy
       potentials stored within magnets to produce rotation without
       external input.  Over the past fifty years a number of designs have
       been patented.  There are several motors of this type in development




       which show promise for use in power generation.

       Transmutation Of Elements has been reported by many investigators
       since the turn of the century.  These researchers used the
       electromagnetic principles of vortex mechanics to effect changes in
       matter that are not explained by conventional theory.

       Cold Fusion is an excess energy phenomenon whose explanation lies
       outside the realm of conventional physics.  Because the cold fusion
       experiments were conducted and reported by chemists, the physics
       community who was normally associated with fusion research, took a
       dim view on the reports of those who appeared to be interlopers into
       a restricted territory.  Cold Fusion has also led to the phenomenon
       of the politicization of science.  Cold Fusion research has been
       labeled as "bad research" by the U.S. Department of Energy which
       supports the multibillion dollar efforts of physicist who are
       attempting to produce fusion through other means.

       Scalar Wave Theory involves the mathematics that is used in modeling
       vortex mechanics, zero point energy, transmutation, and the design
       of over unity devices.  It is based on the little know area of
       mathematics known as quaternion theory.
