                        New Automobile runs on Human Urine
                                  by Arky Garber

       An engineering genius who worked for one of the giant auto makers
       in Detroit says  he's  invented  the answer to the energy crisis - a
       car that runs on human urine.

       But Morris Wilhelm, 57, says the  government  and  big  business are
       trying to hush up his plans to produce cars fueld by human waste.

           "I get threatening letters and phone calls every  day  from  the
            big oil companies and auto manufacturers," complains Morris.

            They're scared  to  death of my car because it means they won't
            make billions of dollars any  more.   But  I  want  to help the
            United States.   I  don't  want us to depend on  any  of  those
            Middle East  sheikhs  or  dictators for our energy.  Now we can
            tell them all to go to hell!"

       Morris began working on his "pee-mobile"  auto,  which  he calls the
       Wilhelm, back in  the  late  70s  when the energy crisis  first  hit
       America.  He was  fired  from his high-salaried auto engineering job
       in 1983 by  superiors  who  branded   him   a   "lunatic"   for  his
       revolutionary ideas.

       But he continued on his mission, completing the first  urine-powered
       auto in January.

       "It's really a very simple idea, based on the principles of nature,"
       he says.

           "It's the way the world works.  The waste of one organism is the
            fuel of  another.   Growing  grass  feeds  on steer manure.  We
            breathe the  oxygen that plants  give  off;  they  breathe  the
            carbon dioxide  we give off.  Why is it so far-fetched  that  a
            machine could run on what the human body gives off?"

       Morris' energy-saving engine  feeds  on  the  insoluble  nitrogenous
       acid, salts, pigments and ammonia fumes in human urine.

           "The beauty of this machine  is  its  absolute  efficiency,"  he
            boasts.  "Most people stop at a service staion  to  fill  their
            tanks and  relieve  themselves.   Now this can be done anywhere
            and in one single time-saving action."

       Morris says he's looking for several brave, "environment-conscious"

       financial backers to help him mass produce the Wilhelm.

       He says the   four-cylinder   models  will  sell  for  approximately
       $10,000.
