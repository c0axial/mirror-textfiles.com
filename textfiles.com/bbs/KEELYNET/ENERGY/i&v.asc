       The following is a tongue-in-cheek letter posted to the Tesla BBS in
       regard to turbines and how they would affect society.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

            I'm a bit surprised that the  only info in this BBS (TESLA BBS)
       of TESLA's disk  turbine  that I've found was the TURBINE.ZIP  intro
       blip.  Yea, only  a bit surprised while considering the vast volumes
       on turbines in university and public  libraries  in my area with any
       mention of Tesla totally and efficiently raked out.

            I can't believe that just the enemies of innovation  in  1910--
       inertia and vested   interest,   excuses   the   ignorance  of  this
       technology having EVER  existed.   No,   such   inertia  has  to  be
       maintained and is taking work to mow over grass root  garage  setups
       that occasionally dare  to  replace  a  V-8  with  say a "derby hat"
       turbine. How un-American  this,   dirt,   that  would  threaten  the
       secureness of our industrial complex by stealing its jobs.

            It's bad enough that we didn't successfully squeeze out Tesla's
       push for AC. Thanks to this cult hero we've lost countless  jobs  of
       making up for  energy saved being on a national DC grid.  Heck, we'd
       have power plants in every county. We'd have more cars on more roads
       to maintain more power plants and  we'd all work for power, oil, and
       auto companies. We'd hire the homeless, hire Canadians  and Mexicans
       stuck with AC  and  we'd  be  like  Kuwaities! -- only working for a
       living like Americans, with job security and a robust energy burning
       economy. Burn baby burn! Now that would be growth.

            At least we've been left the  same  basic engine design for the
       past century. As we cave in and inch out just a teeny  bit more bang
       per same old  fuel  to satisfy this environmental cult every year we
       can make it evermore complicated  and  capital  intensive. That way,
       though the Japanese are better at making things complicated, we can

                                      Page 1





       evermore entrench our  job  security  with  patriotism  and a little
       tariff.

            Jobs run the economy which run  the  dollar  whence  all values
       flow from. So  the  ends of keeping national security  through  jobs
       justify any means  because  nothing  is  more valuable than the ends
       which are the essence of value itself.  Our  job  security is just a
       microcosm of American national security as a whole.

            "National security" was also a favorite sound  byte of cold war
       Russia. They're their  own worst enemy. It allows Stalinists' to say
       things like, "3/4 of the population  are  enemies of the state", and
       then secretly kill off more people than Hitler did  without  getting
       the heat.

            But in  America,  only occasionally do ends have to justify the
       means.  The deed is to create need.  The  rest of the time we merely
       maintain this need. If there is none then we'll make  you  some that
       we need.  Need  is  our  business.  Business  IS filling need. But a
       filled need is no business. It was  a sale of it's own elimination--
       can't have that.

            To let the simple technology of this bladeless  turbine  become
       common would vastly  retool  us  down  to  a new level playing field
       approachable by small   business.   Our   waste-energy=make-business
       infrastructure would crumble. The turbine design is too simple. They
       last too long and worse yet are too efficient.

            Our partnership with George Bush's oil conglomerates  in  Texas
       would go down  crick  and  they'd get on us. The bottom line is that
       we'd have massive job loss. And  we'd  have  to  hire  them  into  a
       military state to keep unrest in check and defend...  uh, our way of
       life -- like  the KGB's been doing over there for theirs. This going
       the way of freer energy is in the direction of communist ideals. The
       unemployed, the homeless; that's how communistic we are already.

            How's it go? "The masses would  give  according  to ability and
       take according to need"?  Now where have I heard that before? Was it
       comie-gook Marx?!  How could they give anything if  they didn't earn
       money by selling  energy  to waste and how could they take only what
       they need if we're living proof that  we  excessively grab things to
       waste?

            No--it was Tesla! It went; Designs so simple that  others might
       seize the idea,  patent it, and control a blessing "which he intends
       shall be a free gift to the world."*

            Profitless freedom?! --pie-in-the-sky,  you can't trust anybody
       but us. If anyone should seize these designs it's us since we've got
       government finance to  pay  the highest buy-out and  we've  got  OUR
       engines and can  crowd  out  knowledge of it with our technology and
       sustain the most employment since  we  buddy with oil companies that
       need our cars to milk out all the resources they can find while they
       can.

            The thing is, actually I don't even have a garage.  And I'm far
       from any horse  power  designs.  I build my turbines in my apartment
       out of plexiglass. The duds make OK  sci-fi-art sculptures. I'm sort
       of stuck being an empiricist and have to hack on prototypes and

       experiment.  But I'd like to see some detailed mathematical guidance
       for my plastic as well as explain better what I've made.
