A TOMI track was constructed according to instructions provided by the
inventor, Pat Harris.  This device consists of two cylindrical magnets fixed
on opposite sides of an inclined track and an identical cylindrical magnet
that serves as a roller on the track.

In operation, the roller is placed at the lower end of the track even with the
ends of the track magnets and given the slightest nudge upwards.  The roller
then races up the track between the track magnets and travels beyond their
upper ends with significant kinetic energy.

Measurements were made of the energy imparted to the roller by the track and
the energy required to place the roller at the beginning of the track.  These
two quantities were found to be identical within the precision of the
measurement.

Apparatus

The track and roller magnets were each assembled from 10 annular ceramic
magnets (Radio Shack type) encased in heat shrink tubing.  A long straight
ramp (35" long, 5" wide) was constructed from furniture-grade plywood which
provides a very smooth surface.

The track magnets were clamped to this ramp near its center.

Procedure

For the energy output measurements, this ramp was propped up at a known angle,
typically 4-10 degrees. The roller magnet was carefully introduced to the
lower end of the track and pushed very slowly upwards past the neutral force
point which is located very near the point where the center of the roller is
even with the lower end of the track magnets.

Once the roller has been nudged past this point, it takes off and rolls up the
ramp past the upper ends of the track magnets.  The highest point reached by
the roller was recorded in each test.

Several tests were made at 4 different track angles.  In each case, the
highest point the roller reached was taken as the height value for that track
angle.  The total length of the roll varied between 5" and 10" along the
track.

The sine of the track angle was used to compute the height gain for each test.

The roller magnet was accurately weighed and the output energy was computed
by:
          E = mgh

where m is the roller mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the
vertical height gain that occurred during the roll.

The input energy was measured by numerically integrating the product of force
and distance while moving the roller magnet to the starting point of the track
from a distant location on the entrance side of the track from the (6" away
from the starting point).

The force vs location data for this integration was obtained with a fixture
that held the roller on the track at a specific location.  This fixture
captured the roller in a confined space which allowed a very small amount of
rolling movement to occur.

With the roller thus contained at a known location along the path towards the
starting point of the TOMI track, the ramp was tilted until the angle was
found that generated the necessary gravitational force resultant (in the track
direction) to balance the magnetic repulsion force.

The sine of the track angle was used to compute the force resultant.  These
force determinations were made at 1/2" intervals over the first four inches,
1/4" intervals over the next inch, and 1/8" intervals over the last inch of
the path.

Results

The output energy measurements:   track angle (degrees)   E (millijoules)
                                       4.86                   31.8
                                       6.07                   33.0
                                       8.73                   34.0
                                       5.05                   32.2

The mean output energy was 32.8 millijoules and the observed standard
deviation was .001 millijoules...about 3% relative.

The input energy measurement consisted of 18 separate data points taken as
described above.  The sum of F*dx was 32.9 millijoules.

Since this procedure was conducted only once, an observed standard deviation
cannot be computed.  However, an estimate of the error in determining the
correct track angle for each location along the path indicates that the
relative error in the integration result is probably about 2%.

The ratio of the measured output energy to the measured input energy is 0.99.

The errors in each measurement are independent and combine in quadrature to
yield an overall expected error of 3.6%.

In other words,    Eout
                 -------   =   0.99  +/- 0.0036
                   Ein

Conclusion

Within the measurement precision of this experiment, the energy required to
place the roller magnet at the start of the track is equal to the energy
delivered to the roller when released from the start of the track.

The apparent anomaly in the TOMI track is presumably due to the difficulty one
has in correctly perceiving the work done on the roller when it is placed at
the start of the track by hand.

The maximum repulsive force that occurs as the roller is placed is only about
1/2 the weight of the roller.  Thus the roller only seems to get a little
lighter as it is placed.  When the roller is released, the output energy is
dramatically demonstrated by the motion of the roller.

As a result, the TOMI device appears to involve an energy gain but these
measurements show that it does not.

It is possible that the TOMI device exhibits a small anomalous behavior that
would not have been detected by these measurements.  With the precision
obtained in these tests, such an anomaly would have to be less than 5%
relative.
