The following is a compilation of 3 files from the alt.sci.physics.new-
theories USENET.  It all started with the suggestion that time might be
analog and the Niels Bohr Institute response by Viggo Simonsen followed about
one month later.  They all deal with the possibility that time is a repeating
wave and possibly speeding up as it advances.

Hi Colin!

There is a fellow named Terence McKenna who has evolved a theory that time
speeds up the closer we get to the year 2012.  He has a computer program and a
book which helps to understand his theories.  He bases it on the Mayan
calendar and some other items relating to sacred geometry as well as chaos
theories.  Quite fascinating material overall despite the new age
connotations.

McKenna claims time is a wave that consists of 'structure-breaking' and
'symmetry-making' periods.  'Structure-breaking' is when patterns are unstable
and subject to collapse from certain stimuli.

'Symmetry-making' refers to periods where new patterns are formed and locked
into reality.  We at KeelyNet have found this work to be coincidental with our
radionics researcher and friend, Peter Kelly.

Pete has come up with a theory he calls 'energy as information.' Matter is
formed according to a signature (many interrelated frequencies) which are held
in an electrical form.  Magnetism is what holds the matter in a stable form.
So, to change the properties of matter, you must reduce the magnetic field,
alter the electrical signature to your will, then restore the magnetic field.
The sustained new pattern will transmute the matter.

The way this correlates with McKenna is that the Earth has a waning and waxing
magnetic field which is partially recharged by the magnetosphere of the Sun.
So, over time, the earth and all on it are subjected to this magnetic
weakening to allow 'structure-breaking' when the electrical signature is most
subject to change.  This is the time when radical changes appear in our
society, wars are waged, territories change, new discoveries are made, etc....

As the earth's magnetic field increases in strength, the sustained patterns
will become locked in and remain in control ('symmetry-making') until the
electrical signature is again allowed to change from a reduction in magnetic
force.  During this time, few new ideas surface and conditions akin to those
of the 'Dark Ages' are in control.  It would therefore seem desirable to
produce the best possible conditions before the increase in magnetic field
strength.

This all ties in with your idea of time possibly being an analog wave.
McKenna says the same wave is repeated OVER and OVER as we draw ever closer to
this 'strange attractor' which is pulling us all toward the year 2012 (as per
the Mayans and McKenna's calculations).

As the time waves repeat themselves, they get smaller and smaller, hence your
idea that they would reproduce in ever smaller increments.  McKenna says that
by studying the WAVE itself, we can determine WHEN these points will appear to
take advantage of them in everyday life when conditions are subject to
building or destroying.  Intriguing concept, eh?

Thank you for the interesting thought....if you wish, we have 3 web sites,
best of which is   http://www.eskimo.com/~billb   Bill runs an excellent
alternative science web page and lists many of the KeelyNet files under weird
science.  You can also call the original Dallas board at (214) 324-3501 when I
get the hard drive repaired.  All access and downloads are free as we exist to
exchange information and promote alternative thinking and experiments.

                              CYCLIC TIME PHYSICS

              by Viggo Simonsen, Niels Bohr Institute, Copenhagen

How would physics look like if Time was cyclic, i.e. if all spacetime events
were to repeat identically an infinite number of times?

In 1949 Kurt Godel came up with a solution to Einsteins field equation with a
metric that implied existance of closed timelike curves. His as well as
others' solutions have been rejected on the basis of physical absurdities,
such as the posibility of traveling back in the past and killing your mother
before she gave birth to you. This clearly violates causality, since the very
cause for one's birth is now removed.

My feeling however from discussions and the literature that I have come
across, is that the issue and implications of cyclic time have not been
properly understood. Cyclic time as envisaged by the ancient hindus and greeks
or even by a modern philosopher as Nietzshe meant closure of Time itself and
thus a recurrence of all events in history, not local timeloops that would
allow for individual timetravels. Furthermore the period of the timecycle was
thousands of years, so no human being could possibly meet his mother before he
was born.

Closed timelike paths (CTP) in General Relativity (GR) are generally
considered to be pathalogical because they imply logical absurdities of the
kind mentioned above.

Clearly such possibilities are unacceptable, and in fact the whole debate of
CTP and causality violation is more of a philosophical than of a physical
interest. The problem doesn't become less confusing by the fact that the very
nature of time is so poorly understood and is treated ambigouisly in the
literature. On the one hand, time in GR is still the real number "t",
appearing in all the dynamic equations, and this mathematical definition of
time serves excellently on a locally flat spacetime, where time can be
considered as linear and uniform.

GR is a local theory with no a priori constraints on the global topology, but
it is absolutely unclear how "t" should be interpreted with a global topology
that admits CTP. What does it mean that a traveller moving on a non-geodesic
path enters his own past? What does it mean to say that t has assumed its
original value? Mathematically it is clear, but physically it is a pretty
confusing situation. If I go back into the past once, I will be doomed to do
it for eternity, because by definition the past is closed, that is, no event
that has already taken place can be changed - the past is fixed once and for
all. And thus I will inevitably come back to the time when I made the
timetravel before and do it again and again, ad infinitum - simply because all
events up until and including my departure are fixed. But by the same token my
future will thus be closed, or rather my history becomes perfectly cyclic.

The ambiguity of time in physics comes about, because we use it as a kinematic
parameter as well as a label for "historical" events. If the kinematic time
along a worldline due to some odd topology happens to repeat we infer that the
travelling observer is actually coming back to a set of past events. And
because we somehow  still attribute a free will and an open future to the
traveller, we allow him to alter the past. It is very tempting to apply GR on
Cosmology, but I am afraid it allows for completely nonsensical inferences. GR
is a local theory based on the pragmatic time t, that of a clock, so to say.
Of course we can always integrate the field equation with some odd metric,
but the meaning we attribute to time then, is completely ill-defined.

Despite all this, the concept of Cyclic Time in physics, as mentioned above,
is not at all meaningless or absurd, as long as it doesn't violate the
principle of a closed past.  It is perfectly possible, at least from a logical
point of view, that all observers move continuously into their own past in the
course of time, in which case we could have a closed and finite history that
repeated infinitely. Such CTP's obviously have a minimum length, they will
have to exceed at least the lifespan of the observer. (How can a CTP possibly
exceed de lifespan of the observer? Think about it!) But apart from that there
are very few restrictions on them.

In principle such a CTP could coincide with the lifespan of the observer and
death could act as a wormhole to bring him back to his own birth N years
before. His eternity would then be an infinite number of identical lifes, and
he would never be able to know  whether his life was a particular or an
eternal event, or rather he would always experience it as the only one.

This is just an extreme gedanken experiment, but it is mentioned as an example
of CTPs that do not conflict with causality, or they are at least free of
logical absurdities, though they do seem to challenge our notion of an open
future (notice, that here past and future refers to the same set of events).
Even the overall history of Cosmos could be cyclic, which is precisely what
was believed in archaic cultures prior to modern man.

It would be interesting to see how physics based on such a constraint on time
(periodic boundary conditions) would look like. Tacitly we take time to be
linear, and our cosmological models reflect this view (Big Bang theory) but we
really don't know if it's true. If on the other hand Time is cyclic, it is
bound to affect a whole lot of our contemporary theories, notably the 2. law
of Thermodynamics.

If there is anyone who has been thinking about these issues, I would greatly
appreciate sharing your ideas and/or objections.

Vanguard Note...

Another file makes mention of a phenomenon which directly affects the concept
of accelerated time.  It is called ALTSCI1.ASC on KeelyNet and states that
frequencies are compressed when in the presence of an excitation field.

If McKenna is correct, that time is a wave that repeats at ever smaller
wavelengths (higher frequencies), then does this mean the Earth is really
passing into some higher energy zone?  As is postulated in the idea of the
Photon Belt which claims we MUST evolve or die because the Earth is moving
into an 'enriched' zone.  The same principle applies to 'nuclear genesis'
where an enriched environment can literally grow new elements, see the superb
file MAGSTUFF.ASC on KeelyNet for details about this concept.
