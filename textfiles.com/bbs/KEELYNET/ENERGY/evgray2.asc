                         EMS - Electronic Power That Could
                     Change The World's Economic Power Picture

       Though harassed by  the  authorities,  under-financed and ignored by
       science, business and industry, Edwin  V.  Gray, a self educated Los
       Angeles inventor has developed a revolutionary electromagnetic motor
       that promises to greatly improve conditions for the world.

       A vast new technology is opening because Gray invented  a motor that
       delivers super-efficient horsepower at lower cost with less wear and
       tear than any  other  device known. His EMS motor takes a giant step
       closer to the  magnificent,  whirring  power  plants  visualized  by
       science fiction writers.

       Implications for the  auto  industry  alone  are  staggering:   Gray
       appears to have the answer to Detroit's dilemma involving practical
       electric vehicles.

       Ed Gray's name  may  well  go down in history alongside the likes of
       Edison, Marconi, Goddard and Bell  -  that  is, if the establishment
       will get off his back.

       A social quality known as "resistance to change" and  another called
       the "economic status  quo"  have  made  his  motor  a tale of bitter
       frustration. Most people would have quit in despair long ago.

       However, tireless experimentation  and remarkable determination have
       paid off in  a  technological  triumph  that brings  the  heretofore
       untapped source of static electricity into the workhouse of man. Any
       expert can tell  you  "static electricity will not do work." Gray is
       slowly and doggedly proving the experts wrong.

       His battle is not over, but perhaps  the  tide is finally turning in
       his favor. His  corporation,  EvGray  Enterprises,  is  seeking  the
       necessary financing to further develop the motor. His efforts were
       thwarted by serious legal problems which recently were resolved when
       he agreed to enter a guilty plea to a minor Securities and Exchange
       violation.




                                      Page 1

       Thus nearly two  years  of legal entanglements came to a close.  The
       legal costs alone have been near ruinous. He's won some important
       battles, but he could yet lose the war.

       Gray's start in life wasn't promising. He was one of six children of
       a poor Washington, D.C. family and  grew  up  in  the  streets.  Few
       suspected he had  the  stuff  of a genius. Like many  kids,  he  was
       fascinated by engines  and  motors, but his thinking about them went
       far beyond normal curiosity. He wanted  to  know more than just what
       made them run.

       Gray dropped out of school at 14 and began tinkering with ideas.  He
       was so lacking in formal education that he did not  realize for some
       time that his thinking was both original and far advanced.

       Three things about electricity fascinated him:

            (1)  a capacitor can store an electric charge and release it on
                 demand,

            (2)  pulses of electricity can be sent out and brought back,

            (3)  lightning  bolts  seem  to be more powerful when closer to
                 the earth where the atmosphere is heaviest.

       These were facts  known  to  every   physicist.  But  to  most  such
       scientists, they were  unrelated  facts.  Ed Gray's  genius  was  in
       correlating this knowledge into new technology.

              "I remember   getting  a  shock  when  I  grabbed  a  charged
               capacitor off a work bench,"  he recalled. "That simple fact
               never left  my  mind.   Then I watched when  the  government
               people were testing the first radar across the Potomac River
               - it  stuck  in  my mind when one of the men explained it as
               `pulse out, pulse back.'

              "And I've always been a nut about thunderstorms. I watched
               lightning by the the hours.  I  noticed how much stronger it
               appeared to be when closer to the earth and  just  naturally
               concluded that more air had something to do with it."

       These three principles,  plus a super secret means of generating and
       mixing static electricity, make up Gray's EMS motor.

       Gray grew to adulthood, married, divorced and married again.  For 22
       years, the idea of a special new kind  of motor turned over and over
       in his mind. Meanwhile, he had moved to Southern California where he
       maintained a workshop  and  sought the advice of knowledgeable  men.
       Bit by bit, his ideas began to take shape.

       By 1973, Gray  was  ready  to  demonstrate  his  motor to the world.
       Wisely, he had incorporated himself  to  prevent  the EMS motor from
       being gobbled up by some industry giant who might want to suppress
       it.

       As early as  1957, Gray was pounding the pavement seeking  financial
       backers. Over the  years  he picked up 788 stockholders, all friends
       or friends of friends. This fact was to stand Gray in good stead


                                      Page 2

       later when the  Los  Angeles  County  District Attorney hit him with
       questionable charges of fraud.

       From 1957 to 1972, Gray raised about  $2  million  to  make  the EMS
       motor a reality. That same year he incorporated and built the first
       working model.

       Still, more money was a big need. He approached top  electronics and
       automotive firms such  as  General Dynamics, Rockwell International,
       Ford, General Motors and the like. Usually he was turned away. "When
       they did listen to me and got a little  interested,  it  turned  out
       they wanted 90 per cent. Then it was I who did the turning away," he
       said.

       Gray had interested some top experts, though, men  who  offered  the
       benefits of their  knowledge  to  his  fledgling firm. They included
       Richard B. Hackenberger, an electronics engineer who had served Sony
       and Sylvania, as  well  as  Fritz   Lens,  a  master  machinist  who
       understood what Gray was trying to accomplish. In spring, 1973, Gray
       and his associates unveiled the EMS motor to the world.

       In the workshop,  a  six-volt car battery rested on  a  table.  Lead
       wires ran from the battery to a series of capacitors which are the
       key to Grays's  discovery.  The  complete  system  was  wired to two
       electromagnets, each weighing a pound and a quarter.

       The first demonstration  proved   that  Gray  was  using  a  totally
       different form of electrical current - a powerful but "cold" form of
       the energy.

       As the test started, Gray said: "Now if you tried  to  charge  those
       two magnets with  juice  from  the battery and make them do what I'm
       going to make them do, you would drain the battery in 30 minutes
       and the magnets would get extremely hot."

       Fritz Lens activated the battery. A voltmeter indicated 3,000 volts.
       Gray threw a switch and there was  a  loud  popping  noise.  The top
       magnet flew off with powerful force. Richard Hackenberger  caught it
       in his bare hand.

       What happened was  that  Gray  had  used a totally different form of
       electrical current -  a  "cold"   form  of  energy.  The  fact  that
       Hackenberger caught the  magnet  and  was  not burned  was  evidence
       enough of that.

       It was a  moment  in history perhaps as important as the day in 1877
       when Thomas A. Edison threw a switch  which lit up a glass bulb that
       continued to glow all day and part of the next.

       The demonstration was  witnessed  by two unbiased  experts  and  the
       author of this article, who later printed the story of what he had
       seen in a national publication.

       "The amazing thing  is  that only a small per cent of the energy was
       used. Most of it went back into the battery," Hackenberger said.

       Actually, two "improbables" had  been  demonstrated  that  day.  The
       second was characterized  by  the  lack  of  heat generated  in  the
       magnet, excessive heat being one of the big drawbacks in utilizing

                                      Page 3

       electronics advancements. The successful test seemed to be Ed Gray's
       big break. In reality, his real troubles were just beginning.

       The publicity about the test brought Gray to the attention of a firm
       in Denver which  agreed  to  back  him  with  several million in new
       capital over a period of a few years.  At  the time, Gray planned to
       test market the EMS motor in a radically new auto  body  called  the
       "Fascination," developed by Paul Lewis of Sidney, Nebraska.

       The first prototypes  were  due  on  January  1,  1974.  But by then
       mysterious things had started to happen - misfortunes Gray suspects
       were created by   persons   working   to   undermine   his   motor's
       development.  The Fascination trial was dropped.

       In July, 1974,   raiders  from  the  Los  Angeles  County   District
       Attorney's office descended  on  Grey's  plant  in  Van  Nuys.  They
       confiscated plans, records and the  latest  working prototype of the
       motor.

       Investigators for the D.A. threatened to file a variety  of  charges
       against Gray, ranging  from  fraud to grand theft. Yet months passed
       and no charges were brought. The investigators  defied  all attempts
       by the inventor's lawyers to get the confiscated materials returned.

       Meanwhile, the D.A.'s men sought out Gray's investors  and  tried to
       convince them to prefer charges against him. All refused.

       Finally, eight months  after  the  raid, the D.A.'s office brought a
       series of charges against Gray, including  grand  theft, by claiming
       he had raised money from investors by means of a hoax.  But  all the
       serious charges were  dropped  when  it when it was proved they were
       unfounded.

       Remaining were two  counts of violating  SEC  regulations.  In  late
       March, 1976, Gray pleaded guilty to these misdemeanors,  paid a fine
       and was freed.

       The long-drawn legal  hassle  had  other  serious consequences.  The
       major financing promised by the Denver firm was cut off after only a
       fraction of the money had dribbled in. Fortunately, there was enough
       to enable Gray to build a second prototype engine.

       Today Gray is very careful in the  claims  he  makes  for his motor.
       Even to discuss  that  which  has  already  been   proved   to   the
       satisfaction of skeptical scientists could bring the law down on his
       head again.

       "There has been a lot more to the suppression of my ideas than meets
       the eye," he said. "It is a wonder we have survived."

       But survived he  has  -  and  if some big vested interest was indeed
       behind all his woes, it may be too late for such a force to stop an
       idea whose time may have come.

       Powerful allies are now rallying to his cause. For example, Gray was
       nominated for "Inventor  of the Year"  by  the  Los  Angeles  Patent
       Attorney's Association last February.

       Two highly respected scientists, Dr. Norm Chalfin and Dr. Gene

                                      Page 4

       Wester of California Institute of Technology have publicly endorsed
       Gray's motor.

       Dr. Chalfin was  present  when  Gray demonstrated the latest working
       model in front of a stockholders' meeting.

            "There is no motor like this  in  the  world," Dr. Chalfin told
             the group.  "Ordinary  electric motors use continuous  current
             and constantly  drain  power.  In  this system, energy is used
             only during a small fraction of a millisecond. Energy not used
             is returned to an accessory battery for reuse.

            "It is cool running," Dr. Chalfin  added,  putting  his hand on
             the motor. "There is no loss of energy in the system."

       Dr. Chalfin has placed his own considerable prestige  on the line by
       writing the text  for  Gray's  patent  applications,  the uneducated
       inventor finding the technical writing task beyond him.

       At the same meeting, Dr. Gerald Price,  Gray's  patent counsel, told
       the stockholders: "For  discovering  and  proving   a  new  form  of
       electric power, Mr. Gray has been nominated for the annual award
       presented by the patent lawyers of Southern California."

       Looking forward to  prospects  of  a  brighter  future, Gray says he
       wants to get  the  EMS  motor  into  production  and  prove  he  has
       discovered more than even his backers understand.

       Gray is advised  by  his  lawyers to make no claims.  However,  this
       reporter who has  followed  Gray's  work  closely for four years has
       seen and heard enough to feel safe  in  saying that the inventor may
       be unlocking the key to a natural phenomenon referred to as "ball
       lightning."

       With the combined use of capacitor discharge and  spikes  of  energy
       made up of  mixed  static and direct current, Gray conceivably could
       get more out of a battery than a  battery  has  stored in it, simply
       because he is also tapping the huge reservoir of static  electricity
       in the atmosphere as his motor runs.

       Scientists balk at  this  theory,  but someday Ed Gray may back them
       down another notch. He has already  proved right about the capacitor
       discharge motor idea. With that, his motor already  is revolutionary
       - it runs  cool.  That  in  itself  could  solve  a  myriad of heat-
       resistance problems for  industry.   Cool   running   parts  do  not
       experience the intense friction and wear out a quickly as overheated
       parts do.

       If Ed Gray's  motor  makes  its  final breakthrough  and  goes  into
       general production, it may make the one time dropout into a giant in
       history. It also could be a massive boon to mankind in the following
       ways:

          *  It conceivably could power every auto, airplane, truck, train
             and ship  without using a drop of gasoline, kerosene or diesel
             fuel.

          *  It could cool or heat every American home at a fraction of the
             present day cost.

                                      Page 5

          *  It could power the engines of all heavy industry - likewise
             cheaply.

       And it could accomplish all this without spitting a single speck
       of pollution into the earth's atmosphere.

       One question remains:  How  did  Edwin Gray, an unschooled tinkerer,
       bring together certain facts of technology  and nature into a device
       beyond the capabilities of brilliant, richly subsidized scientists?

            "Someone trained in electronics simply would have looked at the
             concept and said it cannot work," Dr. Chalfin  said. "Gray did
             not know this, and he made it work.

            "As a result, he has provided the world with a totally new and
             exciting technology."
