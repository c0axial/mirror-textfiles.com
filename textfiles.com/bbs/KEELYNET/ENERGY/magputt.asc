         it. May make for some fun experiments connected with cavitation,
         steam, and O-U. Gene Mallove*********************************

I am posting the following for a friend who does NOT have access to Internet.
Comments welcomed.

NOTICE : The prupose of this notice is to place into public domain something
         which I invented so that it may be patented and in order to prevent
         it's use from being restricted in any way.


The device is an engine in which small quantitites of water are turned into
steam by the use of a magnetron (as found in microwave ovens).

Interested parties may wish to try this test:

    Place a few drops of water into a clear plastic 35mm film roll holder and
    put the cap on the film roll holder.

    Place in a microwave oven and turn the oven on.  The 'pop' is the result
    of the water turning suddenly into steam.

The engine I have invented is far more efficient than any other steam engine
because the efficiency of the magnetron in turning water into steam.

In fact, the water droplet 'explodes' very much like air/gasoline explodes in
a conventional internal combustion engine.This engine was first tested in
1992.  I am however unable to invest the required capital to produce a more
sophisticated model and therefore unable topatent it.

Even though I may not be able to profit from this technology, it is too good
to be kept to myself and I would like to spread it around so that others may
be able to use it.

The following is an outline of how to construct the device and a few cautions:

PARTS NEEDED:

   1.  Magnetron from medium power microwave oven.
   2.  Small 4-stroke single cylinder lawn mover engine or similar engine with
       'old style' points and ignition system.
   3.  Automotive alternator with built-in rectifier and regulator, also a 12
       volt auto battery.
   4.  "Trigger" mechanism from an aircraft "strobe" landing light.

INSTRUCTIONS:

   1.  The magnetron fits into the spark plug hole.
   2.  The distributor points are modified so that the contact is closed when
       the piston is at the top dead center and this contact is used to
       activate the aircraft strobe mechanism.
   3.  The high voltage from the strobe is connected to directly fire the
       magnetron which in turn produces steam which moves the piston.
   4.  The engine turns the alternator which keeps the battery charged, which
       supplies the electrical power for the magnetron.

CAUTION AND TIPS : WARNING!!! DANGER!!!!

   1.  Be careful around the magnetron.  KEEP IT SHIELDED WITH METAL.  IT CAN
       CAUSE SEVERE BURNS THAT MAY NOT BE READILY VISIBLE WHEN THEY FIRST
       OCCUR.
   2.  The 'strobe' trigger delivers a very high voltage which can jump to
       ground.  WEAR RUBBER SOLED SHOES AND INSULATE WELL.
   3.  Be sure to modify the distributor points so they close at the top dead
       center. Timing advance depends on the power of the magnetron used and
       the amount of water. Try different carb jet sizes -- drill out if
       needed.
   4.  Due to variables, don't expect high engine speeds without a little
       experimentation due to variables.
   5.  Start with a fully charged battery or your alternator won't work.
   6.  The energy produced is in excess of the power required to run the
       alternator but until you get the RPM up, and the parts wrking in
       harmony, it may be best to use a battery charger instead of an
       alternator.
   7.  An easy way to measure net power output after you have the alternator
       on line is to run a few 12 volt lights from the battery.  You will see
       that the battery stays charged even with the lights on and the motor
       keeps on going.
   8.  Although I have not tried it, the idea of vaporizing water with
       microwaves should also work well in a converted turbine.
