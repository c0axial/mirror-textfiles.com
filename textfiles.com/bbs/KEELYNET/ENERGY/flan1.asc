 Here a repost of messages about the neurophone. Dr. Flanagan has given me the
 permission to re-echo some of the messages that we had in E-mail. I re-edited
 them slightly to keep only the "good stuff":
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dear Dr. Flanagan,

 I have started to read the files that your uploaded in the library and of
 course, I have some questions. I figure that many other people also have
 questions but just don't dare to start. <g> By the way, before to go further,
 I have noticed that your replies appeared  to  be  the start of new topics in
 the forum. This  would  tend  to indicate to me that you are  composing  your
 messages on-line and  that  is  a costly way to do things.  If you don't have
 one of the navigation software, download the file AUTOP.INF in library #1. It
 describes the different software to read  and write messages off-line. If you
 already have one, then you're in business and can disregard this paragraph!

 You say that the art of production of a true neurophone was not contained in
 your patents. The first thing that comes to my mind is that if you found the
 effect with simple circuitry, then reproducing one should be relatively easy
 (although it would not produce optimal results). Is that a safe assumption?

 You also say  that  you  were  able  to stimulate visual phenomena  when  the
 electrodes were placed over the occipital region of the brain. Where these
 phenomena simple light spots, shades, or something else? Did you notice what
 changed their forms or colors (maybe types of modulation?)

 Re: Dr. Coanda.  Is  there  any truth to the rumor that he would have found a
     way to reproduce the aerodynamic flow  of  flying  saucers (i.e. no sonic
     bangs at supersonic speeds)?

 About dolphin research, there is one member overhere who is involved in that
 too. He is mostly looking at EEG and got hold of one of your neurophone a few

                                     Page 1




 months ago. His name is David Cole [70515,1161].

 >>encoding mechanism used   by  human  to  decode  speech  intel  patterns...
   mechanism used by brain to locate sound  source in 3-D space... holographic
   sound system<<
   This sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about it (in  addition to the
   fact that  it  acts like a Whitehouse coorelator with time encoded ratios)?
   Does it have anything to do with the 44 bit code of Lisitsyn (sp?) that Tom
   Bearden is  pointing at? Do you know  of  any  reference  describing  these
   mechanisms?

 >>man-dolphin translator<<
   You say that when the dolphins whistled, the speakers output  human  speech
   sounds and  you  developed a joint language. I guess that once both parties
   can interact, you can expect a language  to  develop  for  things for which
   none of you had names before. But can you tell us what  this  dolphin-human
   sound sounded  like,  and  also  to  what foreign language did your dolphin
   language sounded the most alike?

 >>digital neurophone... never published algorithms...<<
   Do you intend to publish it one day?

 >>Vidiophone in the future<<
   Near or long future? That would certainly  be impressive. In the mean time,
   it seems  that not too many people have heard of the neurophone.  Are  they
   still manufactured  and  sold?  If  yes,  would  you  mind pointing us to a
   source?  Also, in these days of walkman, subliminal tapes and machines, why
   did the neurophone never take off? (too  expensive? simpler to use a normal
   tape recorder? Else?)

 What are your opinions regarding holographic brain theories? I have read the
 book "The Holographic Universe" by Michael Talbot and it seems to me that
 holographic approaches are  the  most promissing leads to  understanding  the
 keys of the  universe. It is probably why David Bohm had such an affinity for
 them!  And last (for now!), I was impressed  with the fact that you were able
 to transmit clear voice over 1000 miles using mW power. Can  you tell me more
 on how that was done and where I could find information on that? It has some
 similarity with electromagnetic   missile   (also  called  EDEPT)  and  their
 acoustic cousins called ADEPT which are  ways  to  direct energy and were the
 results of research done on SDI and published in IEEE magazines.

 1. Thank you  for the info on navigation software, I currently  use  CIM  and
    have ordered WINCIM.
 2. Neurophone &  Visual  Phenomena:  The  visual  phenomena consisted of wavy
    lines and phospene type phenomena. W  Grey Walter in his book: "The Living
    Brain" states that certain clues indicate that the scanning  mechanism  in
    the brain  is  in  a  spiral  pattern.  Therefore any attempt to stimulate
    coherent imaging  will  have  to  have  a  spiral  scan  rather  than  the
    horizontal X-Y  system  used  by  television.  We have used  some  various
    methods of generating Circular Polarized Neurophone signals with some very
    interesting results.  Unfortunately  the Neurophone would require a really
    large research budget to really investigate these phenomena.
 3. Dr. Henrie Marie Coanda had over 500  patents  but  most of the data about
    the actual curves of the Coanda devices was trade secret. He taught me the
    math that  he  used  in  the devices. I witnessed a torpedo  traveling  at
    speeds of 100 MPH under water. These torpedoes created no wake or pressure

                                     Page 2




    waves but  were  "sucked" through the water by means of the Coanda Effect.
    In 1918, Dr. Coanda built a saucer  that  was 12" in diameter. This saucer
    was able to lift an 800 pound Nitrogen tank off the ground.  The  lift  to
    surface area  ratio  was  outstanding. His work may have been picked up by
    the Nazi's but Coanda did not work with  them. He was arrested in Paris by
    the Gestapo  when they found out that he was drinking  coffee.  Since  the
    only coffee was available by Black Market, they thought he was a spy. They
    refused to go into his green house where he grew coffee. He was eventually
    release  when they "lost" his file by means of bribery.
 4. The Man-Dolphin translator was able to translate English or any other
    language into whistles. The Dolphins then imitated the whistles and the
    translator would put out perfect English or whatever. We were able to come
    up with  a  35 word vocabulary before the project was disbanded due to the
    death of my partner, Dr. Dwight Wayne  Batteau,  the  head of the project.
    Before then end of the project, the dolphins were able  to  create  simple
    sentences on  their  own.   This should not be surprising because Apes are
    taught to  communicate by sign language.  Dolphins  and  whales  are  much
    smarter than apes.
 5. The Algorithm of the Neurophone is based on the time- ratio  encoding that
    is used by all of nature. Time-ratio encoding is independent of frequency.
    That is  what  is wrong with the vocoder. It depends on frequency. A child
    has a much smaller vocal cavity than  an adult, the frequency of its voice
    is much different but we can understand what children  say  because speech
    is time  ratio  encoded.   Ratio  encoding  is  used throughout nature for
    example Euler's number 2.718..., PHI  1.6180339889, etc. These ratios have
    meaning. The   visual   system  recognizes  ratio  encoding   for   object
    identification and  the hearing system uses time- ratios between wave form
    events. As far as I know, no one else  has  ever used time-ratio encoding.
    The original Dolphin translators and Neurophones used discreet components.
    Today, a computer can perform all kinds of mathematical algorithms on wave
    forms. A NEW Neurophone will use these capabilities. I hope to get one out
    early next year.  We produced several thousand Neurophones  that  sold for
    $1000 to  $1500. My goal is to manufacture a really slick one that will be
    like a Sony Walkman and will sell for a few hundred dollars, but the money
    required set up production will be pretty high.
 6. The Neurophone proves that the brain is holographic. The other theory is
    that the brain is hard-wired. If the  brain was hard-wired, the Neurophone
    would not work by alternate neural pathways. We have  shown  that  we  can
    hear through the optic nerve, the facial nerve and the trigeminal nerve.
 7. The MW power transmission over 1000 miles was by means of using my
    time-ratio encoding to produce a narrow bandwidth transmitter. Distance at
    low power  is  a  signal  to  noise ratio problem. By narrowing bandwidth,
    distance is increased because the ratio is improved.
 8. ADEPT and EDEPT: I would like to know how I can get copies of that data. I
    was not familiar with it. I also worked  on Scalar wave communications and
    built scalar  wave transmitters and receivers. We were  able  to  transmit
    intelligence over  several  miles  under  water and through the earth. The
    original ideas came from Wallace Minto  in  a  system  he  called Hydronic
    Radiation.

 Here's the continuation:

 Thank you very much for your reply. However, I am sure that many lurkers
 (bystanders) were looking forward to your reply too. Unless you had specific
 areas that you  want  to  keep confidential, your reply would  be  much  more
 useful if it  was  made  public  (but addressed to me) in the New Age Science
 section.  Here are further questions that  I intend to repost in the NAF (New
 Age Forum) once you repost your answer overthere.

                                     Page 3




 >> spiral scan of brain <<
    Has its scanning period been identified?
 >> would require  a  really large research budget to really investigate these
    phenomena. >>
    Of course, but would it not be easier today now that you can build almost
    everything in a programmable way?

 >> The data that you have on Dr. Coanda is impressive: 12" diam capable of
    lifting 800 lbs! Wow! When you say that  his curves were trade secrets, do
    you mean that he died with it or was it transfered to some corporation or
    government? What was special about the math that he used?

 >> dolphin-language<< OK. I see. It is somewhat similar to what they did to
    teach sign language to chimpanzes, but in acoustic.

 >> Ratio encoding is used throughout nature for example Euler's number
 >> 2.718..., PHI 1.6180339889, etc. These ratios have meaning.
    So those  ratios would be used and reused to encode the  signals,  like  a
    sort of chaos encoding?

 >> We produced several thousand Neurophones that sold for $1000 to $1500. It
    is amazing  that  you  succeeded  to  sell  thousands at that price! It is
    rather hefty for the typical consumer.  I agree that a few hundred dollars
    would make  it more palatable (and you could also use  the  fact  that  it
    won't disturb  your  neighbors as much as Walkman's earphones playing loud
    music inside a bus!)

 >> money required set up production will be pretty high.
    It depends on the complexity of the  device but I would think that if they
    can crank  out  walman's  type  of devices and still be  profitable,  that
    should not  be  a  major  problem.  You  could likely find many electronic
    manufacturers just  looking  for something  else  to  do  of  their  spare
    manufacturing capability.

 >> Neurophone proves that the brain is holographic. Tom Bearden says that the
    brain is holographic but his main argument is that someone who was
    hydrocephalic obtained a Mathematical degree, thus IQ  is  independant  of
    brain size.

 >> mW transmission   at   1000   miles<<   Yet,   for  it  being  transmitted
    acoustically, (it was acoustically  transmitted,  wasn't it?), it is quite
    remarkable. Any documentation available on it?

 >> ADEPT/EDEPT<< I  have  a  copy of a very illustrated description  in  some
    paper published  by  the Lawrence Livermore Lab which is less mathematical
    than the others. I live in Canada and I don't have American stamps to make
    a SASE in order to be on your distribution list. So I will send you a copy
    of it in exchange of being on your distribution list. (If that's all right
    with you.)   However, if you want to get started right away, you can check
    out "Localized  Wave  Representations   of  Acoustic  and  Electromagnetic
    Radiation" by Ziolkowski, R.W., Besieris, I.M., Shaarawi,  A.M. affiliated
    with Dept  of  Elect  &  Computer  Eng,  Arizona Univ, Tucson, AZ (I guess
    that's relatively close to you!), published  in  Proceedings  of the IEEE,
    Vol.79, No.10, Oct 1991, p.1371-1378.

    Hydronic Radiation?  As  to  scalar  wave  comm,  did  you mean the Rogers
    communication system  or something  really  scalar  like  Tom  Bearden  is
    advancing? Also,  can  you  tell  me  more on how I can  find  information
    (keywords for searches, etc.) on these scalar comm devices?

 Dear Alain:

 Thank you for  your recent epistle. You can upload these letters to the forum
 if you like. Also, I already put you on my mailing list. The same is true of
 everyone who has responded. The SASE  is  to  help  offset  cost  but  I  put
 everyone on anyway.  I am looking forward to the info on the ADEPT and EDEPT.
 The spiral scan frequency of the brain has not been measured to my knowledge,
 however the "flicker" persistence of vision known and used by film makers may
 be a clue.

 1. More Information on time-ratio encoding: Audio Encoding for 3D Sound in
    Space (Holo -sound)--------
    The brain  is able to detect phase differences of 1 microsecond  or  less.
    This was  found  in  our research at Tufts University. The Pinnae or outer
    ear is a "phase encoding" array that  generates  a time-ratio code that is
    used by the brain to localize the source of sounds in  3-D  space. Some of
    the localization time ratios are around one microsecond. A person with one
    ear can localize sound sources (non-linear) to a 5 degree angle   anywhere
    in space. You can test this by closing your eyes and while having a friend
    jingle keys  in  space  around  your  head.  With your eyes closed you can
    follow the keys and point to them very  accurately. If you try this with a
    sine wave from a speaker you cannot locate it at all.  You   can  localize
    the sine  wave if the speaker has a non-linearity or distortion. The brain
    will focus on the distorion and use  it  to  meausre  time ratios.  If you
    distort your Pinnae by bending the outer ears out of shape, your ability
    to localize  the sound source is destroyed. The so-called  cocktail  party
    effect is  the ability to localize voices in a noisy party. This is due to
    the brain's ability to detect phase  differences and then pay attention to
    localized areas in 3-D space. A favorite "intelligence"  trick  is to have
    conversations in  "hard"  rooms with wooden walls and floors. A "bug" will
    pick up  all  the  echoes and will  scramble  the  voice.  If  you  put  a
    microphone in the room with a duplicate of the human pinnae  on top of it,
    you will  be localize the speakers and tune out the echoes - just like you
    were at a party. We used metal ears  18" in diameter that were attached to
    hydrophones. When  these  were  placed  under  water,   we  were  able  to
    accurately localize underwater sounds in 3-D space. We used this system to
    localize whales  and  dolphins. Sound travels 5X as fast under water so we
    made the "Pinnae" larger to give the  same time encoding as we find in the
    air. We also made large plastic ears that were tested  in  Vietnam.  These
    ears were  of  the  same  proportions  as  real ears but were larger. They
    enabled us to hear distant sounds  with  a  high  degree  of  localization
    accuracy in the jungle.
    We were also able to take any sound and encode it so that it was perceived
    as coming  from a specific point in space. Using this technique  we  could
    spread out  an  orchestra and make you think you were in the concert hall.
    As far as I know, this information has never been used commercially except
    in one instance when I allowed the  Beach  Boys  to  record  one  of their
    albums with my special equipment.
 2. Dr. Coanda found that certain curves were better at entraining airflow for
    "fluid amplification".  His  patents  gave designs but  the  actual  curve
    formulas for  maximum efficiency of air entrainment were a secret. He gave
    me his formulas. They were given in confidence so I have  never thought

                                     Page 5




    about revealing  them.  The  curves  are everything. The efficiency of his
    saucer is an example. Any curving  surface  will  entrain  air.  The right
    curve will  entrain  100%  of  the  primary air flow which  then  captures
    secondary flow.  This  is  the  secret  of fluid amplification and airflow
    surface design. The so called Coanda  surfaces  currently used in jets and
    helicopters are really a joke. The curves are not very efficient.
 3. IQ. --- In past years, I was involved in the development of a device known
    as a Neural Efficiency Amplifier. This device measured the efficiency with
    which the brain conducts a light pulse applied to both  eyes  back  to the
    optical centers.  It  was found that IQ is a measure of Neural Efficiency.
    This was  reflected  by  phase  difference  between  the  left  and  right
    hemispheres of  the brain. The high the IQ the less phase  difference.  We
    discovered that the Neurophone usage increased the Neural Efficiency.
 4. Wallace Minto  was  an  inventor  who worked with scalar waves but did not
    know it. He sent me some of his experimental  papers.  I will dig them out
    and share them with you. He may still be around. He  was  in  Florida  the
    last time  heard  from him. He is/was a brilliant scientist. He found that
    he could transmit "electrical" hydronic  waves  through water and that the
    signal in water was not delayed. The same signal passing  through  the air
    by radio  carrier  was  compared  with a signal transmitted through water.
    There was no phase difference.  Theoretically  electrical  signals  travel
    slower in  water  than they do in the air. With his system  there  was  no
    phase difference.  Since  there  was  no such thing as scalar back then he
    called his signals hydronic waves.  He  could only generate them in water.
    He was able to show that certain kinds of fish send out  hydronic signals.
    You can identify the species and locate them in the same way you use radio
    direction finders.   He tried to interest the NAVY but no one would listen
    to him so his ideas died away. I duplicated  all  of  his  experiments and
    went beyond. I discovered  the "secret" of the hydronic  signal  and could
    create the  signals  at  any frequency and could also generate and receive
    these signals in the air. Minto was only able to generate and detect these
    signals in the audio frequency range.
    Whether scalar or not, we have detected these signals from the human body.
    Each "chakra" oscillates at a different  frequency.  The  body  is able to
    detect and  radiate  these signals. The original Neurophone  is  a  scalar
    device. It  does  transmit  both  EM  and  Scalar  signals but the body is
    responding mostly to the scalar component.
    Bearden makes  things  too complex.  He  is  brilliant  and  his  math  is
    excellent.  But he gives no guidelines for experimental  work.  Generation
    and detection  of scalar signals is really simple. The antenna designs are
    exactly the  opposite  of antenna that  are  designed  for  EM  radiation.
    Perfect 1:1  standing wave ratio antennas do not generate  scalar  fields.
    The so called mis-matched antennae work great!
    By the  way, did you know that the angle of the Great Pyramid is such that
    the apex is a perfect match to the impedance of free space? The angle of a
    horn antenna affects its apex impedance  at  resonance.  By  changing  the
    angle, the  matching impedance varies. Back in the early  days  of  radio,
    people had  to  experiment  to  find  the  rules  of  antenna engineering.
    Engineers developed geometries that  maximize  EM  radiation  and minimize
    scalar power. By reversing the process we were able to maximize scalar and
    minimize EM.
 5. T. Townsend  Brown  was a friend of mine way back. His  "gravitators"  and
    other anti-gravity  devices  are  scalar antennae. I think that people are
    missing the boat on looking at EM effects  on  the body. The living system
    is infinitely more responsive to scalar signals.

 That's all for now! Kindest regards, Patrick Flanagan <<>>

 >> I am looking forward to the info on the ADEPT and EDEPT. <<
    Good! One  more  copy  to  do and I'll send it tomorrow, By the way, ADEPT
    means Acoustic Directed-Energy Pulse  Train, and EDEPT is the same but for
    the electromagnetic form.

 1. Ear models: interesting. I remember hearing something about Coke or Pepsi
    trying to do an ad with a special sound encoding process.  Was  that  this
    one?  (I'm sure it did not have anythingto do with the Beach Boys). By the
    way, do you know which song or album it is the Beach Boys used your device
    to record?

 >> The so called Coanda surfaces currently used in jets and helicopters
 >> are really a joke. The curves are not very efficient. <<
    Interesting! So  you  are  essentially  saying  that  Coanda's secret will
    disappear with you? What a loss. Imagine  how  more  efficient helicopters
    could be made, or even made into flying saucers!

 >> Neural Efficiency  Amplifier,  Neurophone increased Neural  Efficiency  <<
    Wow!  You should suggest that device to the Mensa group! <grin>

 >> certain kinds of fish send out hydronic signals. <<
    Hmmm! Interesting!  Do  you  know  why  these fishes were capable of these
    signals? (i.e. where they mostly fishes  defending  themselves  against  a
    prey, or some other correlation?)

 >> and could create the signals at any frequency and could also generate
 >> and receive these signals in the air. >>
    That's where it gets really interesting for me! If your phase was measured
    with reference to the airwave, how did you know that  it  existed  in  the
    air?  I.e. how did you transmit and receive them?

 >> whether scalar or not, we have detected these signals from the human
 >> body. Each "chakra" oscillates at a different frequency. <<
    That's what  Dr. Valerie Hunt of UCLA is claiming too. I don't remember if
    I already  asked  you  the question,  but  did  you  read  the  book  "the
    Holographic Universe" by Michael Talbot? That's where I  saw it mentioned.
    There was also some holographic effects measured (something like a thought
    pattern measured from a limb, or something like that).

 >> The original Neurophone is a scalar device. It does transmit both EM
 >> and Scalar signals but the body is responding mostly to the scalar

    From looking  at  the patents, that does not seem obvious. Can you tell me
    how it was transmitting a scalar signal? Would it be when the audio signal
    gets modulated  on the carrier? (i.e.  a  negatively  going  audio  signal
    cancels out some part of the positively going carrier  wave?)  And how did
    you determine  that the body respond mostly to the scalar component? (That

    Tell me about it! I have read almost all of his papers. I have even posted
    one of his most recent one in the library  overhere (with his permission).
    However, I  understand that the guy is under non-disclosure  rules  so  he
    obviously cannot  give  details.  The  superficial  stuff  is  nonetheless
    interesting but it is not sufficient  to  convince old-fashioned R&D folks
    that scalar  waves can be used to have effects at distances,  etc.  It  is
    like cold  fusion,  or  as the Japanese call it, New Hydrogen Energy (i.e.
    not necessarily fusion), the establishment  refuses to believes that there
    is something there!

    That's what  they  say  about Tesla: he was aiming at imperfect VSWR. Have
    you detected a different speed of propagation  (than  the  speed of light)
    for these scalar waves?

    I remember  having  read  that  somewhere.  I thought  that  it  was  only

    Especially if the Ark of the Covenant was reproduced (from the scriptures)
    and found to generate lethal high voltages.

    How smart! Thanks for the hint.

    The book "The Vindicator Scroll" by Stan Deyo describes  some  movie  tape
    from his  devices. The author says that Brown was trying to build a device
    approximating the shape of a saucer seen by Adamski. Is there any basis to
    that?

 >> The living system is infinitely more responsive to scalar signals. <<
    That's what Bearden is saying. Mitogenetic radiations et al would rule the
    body. He also says that some cells which died where revived with phase
    conjugated mitogenetic radiations, only if they had not been exposed to UV
    light in the mean time.

    Oh Yes! And there's more to come! (I'll  repost your messages and this one
    and hopefully, we'll get a few more participants to the  discussion in the

 Alain - I  got a copy of the Ziolkowski paper you told me  about.  This  data
 looks very familiar,  it  seems that others are also working in this area and
 getting some interesting results. The information I sent you last night about
 time encoding for  3-D hearing and Scalar  signals  from  fish  fit  in.  The
 equipment that we  used  was  very  simple,  I  could  easily  draw  up  some
 experiments that anyone  could  perform  to  create  their  very  own  scalar
 comminicators. The text would have to  be  in Windows WRI or Word for Windows
 format because I would have to make some drawings.  The drawings  I have seen
 that have been rendered in ASCII are really crude.  I really look forward to

 04-Aug-93 - To: Alain Beaulieu/SL9 - From:  Patrick Flanagan
 Subj:  Neurophone & uclusters
 Dear Alain:

 I get carried  away  with  my  writing  and  tend  to put out information too
 rapidly without ancillary backup.

 1. EAR: I cannot remember what album  it  was,  it  was recorded in or around
    1973 or 74.

 2. I do not intend to die with Coanda's secret, I have thought  about it and
    see no problem in revealing the curves. Interestingly  they  are  directly
    related to  Vortex  curves.  I  need  to  write an article  about Coanda's
    "nozzles". The problem is that the people  who could use the data probably
    will never see the data no matter how we publish it.
 3. According to  Minto,  the  fish  appear  to  be  using  these  signals  to
    communicate. He  used  the  system to locate schools of fish for fisherman
    (in some trials). I worked with these detectors after we finished our NAVY
    work.  My intention is to put together  some  receivers  and  travel  to a
    dolphin research  facility  and  see  if I can record these  signals  from
    dolphins.
 4. The phase test was made by transmitting one signal through the air by EM
    waves while  simultaneously  transmitting  the  scalar  signal through the
    water.  The test was to prove that  the  water  signal  was indeed scalar.
    Minto had a few detractors who said that the water signal  must  be  an EM
    signal. If  it were an EM signal, the transmission of an EM signal through
    water is much slower than the transmission  speed through the air. So much
    so that the time difference could be easily measured  by  a  dual  channel
    oscilloscope. (Of  course  we  all know that EM signals do not travel long
    distances under water anyway). The test proved that the signal traveled as
    fast through water as it did through  the  air.  This  indicates  that the
    water signal  is  not delayed or slowed down by denser  media  as  are  EM
    waves.
 5. Valerie Hunt's work bears no resemblance to our chakra work. The closest
    work was done by Dr. Hiroshi Motoyama in Japan.
 6. The NEUROPHONE as SCALAR DEVICE: The original Neurophone output was an
    amplitude modulated  30  -  50  KHz  signal with a voltage at resonance of
    about 3000 peak to peak. The output  electrodes  were capacitor disks made
    of copper and these were about one inch in diameter. The copper disks were
    covered by  thin  mylar  film  (1/2  mil).  The head and  its  distributed
    dielectric qualities  was  the  dielectric  of a higher voltage capacitor!
    Since the left and right Neurophone electrode signals were 180 degrees out
    of phase with respect to each other,  the  EM  signals canceled each other
    somewhere in the middle of the head.  Since the EM signals canceled we had
    a powerful scalar vector left over right where we wanted  it,  inside  the
    brain!
 7. BODY RESPONSE  TO  SCALAR  FIELDS:  In 1974, I created a device called the
    Earth Resonance Generator. It was an  8 Hz pulse generator. The purpose of
    the device was to create a Zietgeber or biological clock  to  balance  the
    energy centers of the body - Schuman Resonance Device. We used acupuncture
    meters and a crude scalar detector and a ballistic kinesiometer to measure
    the effect of the ERG on the body.
    We first  used  magnetic  coils as an output the switched to mobius coils.
    The magnetic pulse had very little effect  on our measurements. The mobius
    coil (scalar coil) output had a powerful effect. If the  mobius  was  left
    hand wound, the effect was balancing and positive while a right hand

                                     Page 9




    mobius coil produced illness, i.e. nausea and headaches.
    We marketed  the  ERG and sold about 40,000 of them between 1974 and 1980.
    TWA airline crews purchased a lot of them because they prevented jet-lag.
 8. PINK NOISE NEUROPHONE: In 1976, we put a device on the market that was
    called the Pink Noise Neurophone. It was not for listening to music, but
    produced a pink noise scalar wave.  The  device  was really kind of like a
    Scalar Wave  Lakhovsky  oscillator. Once we found that  scalar  waves  are
    acted on  by the body, it seemed like the best thing to do. The PNN worked
    so well it put all the acupuncture  meridians  into  balance  in  about 20
    minutes of use.
 9. Scalar waves seem to be propagated instantly but my  mind  tells  me  that
    this must not be so. The test under water would indicate that scalar waves
    propagate faster  than  EM  waves  in certain media. It may be that scalar
    waves can be propagated instantly is  they have a tensor vector, i.e. they
    modulate a tensor vector in the space matrix.

 10. Townsend Brown found that the saucer shape was the best for a gravitator
     vehicle. He found this shape by itself, and did not as  far as I know get
     it from  Adamski. He and discussed the shape and he told me he came on it
     himself.

 Alain, I am enjoying our exchange. Most of this stuff has been buried in my
 brain while I have worked on the water. It seems that we were a little bit
 ahead of the rest.  I am enjoying digging  it out because I would like to put
 it all together and write a book about all these things,  a  -- how to-- book
 that experimenters can use to create their own equipment.

 Until next time, Patrick Flanagan

    Hmmm! That's  not  evident. Can you explain a bit?  I will be mailing your

    Why's that?  Would  it be because the type of "peer review" journals would

    it would be published in a non-field-related paper?

    Huh? Do you mean that he could pick  up  "gossips"  from the fish to point
    out an area of fishing to stay away from (from the point  of  view  of the
    fish)?

 [Post-Ed: I did not know then that a "flock" of fish was called a "school" of

 >> comparison of EM in air with scalar in water<<
    My question  was  aimed at comparing EM in air with scalar in air. In what
    way did you detect that they were different?

    I'll get back to you after verification on that.

 >> The head and its distributed dielectric qualities was the dielectric

    Why are you saying "of a higher voltage"?  I  can  visualize that you have
    two capacitors on a capacitors, and that the signals would  have  a  phase
    inversion because of the different polarity. Is that what  you mean?

    That sounds  like  what is being sold today as the Teslar. It was designed
    by Dr.  Puharich I believe. Are these  ERGs  still  being manufactured and
    sold today?  What about the Pink Noise Neurophone?

 >> Scalar waves seem to be propagated instantly but my mind tells me
 >> that this must not be so. <<
    If they are the primary field, they should be able to change the boundary
    conditions of the "conventional" electromagnetism. According  to  Bearden,
    you can  accelerate  the  speed of time with scalar fields, so indirectly,
    that would affect the speed of propagation.  Dr.  Aspden  mentioned that a
    fellow by the name of Wiener found that time was affected  in  a  standing
    wave, That  was  approx.  3  years  after the Michelson-Morley experiment.
    Aspden claims taht it is one of the  reason  why M-M experiment was faulty
    (it had standing waves in it).

    Definitely!

    That would be EXTREMELY interesting! I was myself thinking of sorting out
    through the stuff and writing something that sounds like Scalar EM 101 but
    I am a bit rusty in my math, and some of the math that  I have seen in the
    EDEPT paper  are  enough to stop me dead in my track! Let me know if I can
    help.

 By the way, do you know Dr. Michrowski of the Planetary Association for Clean
 Energy? He has writen of bibliography  of  all  the "new energy" publications
 and papers related to these weird topics.

 Incidently, is there a reason why you prefer to discuss the neurophone by
 E-mail rather than via the New Age Forum? The practice is  that  we  normally
 keep the E-mail  for  confidential matters but post the other messages in the
 forum of interest so that more people can  interract. That is why I requested
 your explicit permission  to repost most of our private discussion  onto  the
 forum.  So I assume that you still don't have any objection to myself

 >> Valerie Hunt's work bears no resemblance to our chakra work. The

    You are  right  about  Dr.  Motoyama.  The  book says that he successfully
    developed a technique for measuring  the  electrical  presence of chakras.
    But it does not say how. (p.190) [The Holographic Universe]
    As to Valerie Hunt, Talbot says that she discovered that the electrodes of
    the electromyograph could pick up a field of higher frequencies  than  the
    highest component  of  the  heart rate (averaged between 100 and 1600 cps,
    but sometimes higher). But the fields  were  found  to be strongest in the
    areas associated with the chakras. (p.175) She did not  measure  them with
    moebius sensors  so  she  did not measure the scalar component but she did
    detect the chakras.  Your method was  done  using  moebius sensors so your
    work is definitely different than hers but I don't know how much different
    Motoyama's work is from yours.

 (The book did not have enough details to sort out all of this without your
 explanations).
