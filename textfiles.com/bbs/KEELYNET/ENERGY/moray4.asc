                                  Radiant Energy
                        For Beyond the Light Rays Lies the
                              Secret of the Universe
                                   and the Atom
                    The Evolution and Transmutation of the Atom

                                Dr. T. Henry Moray

                    The words "Radiant Energy" and "Dr. Moray"
                  have been synonymous for the past twenty years.

       The reader should  bear  in mind that most of the ideas as set forth
       in the following pages, as also at a later date, were first given to
       the world by Dr. Moray from 1911  to  1931,  and therefore should be
       read with that thought in mind.

       In the past we permitted ourselves to be put on the defensive in our
       attempts to prove our stand.  This was a mistake,  as  TRUTH  should
       never be put on the defensive.  The system of instruction of the Far
       East rather than  that  of  the  Western  World  should  be  used in
       advancing new discoveries of truth.

       The message is delivered WHETHER HIS HEARERS AGREE WITH HIM OR NOT.

       He does not care whether they all  agree  with  him  or  not, for he
       feels sure those  who  are  ready  for  the  truth he  teaches  will
       recognize it, and  for  the  others,  if  they  are  not prepared to
       receive the truth, no amount of argument  will  help  matters.   The
       Eastern teacher knows that much of his teaching is  but the PLANTING
       OF SEED  (as  in  KeelyNet)  which will GROW and be recognized after
       the lapse of time.

       We do not  mean  that  anyone  should   BLINDLY   ACCEPT  EVERYTHING
       presented to him,  but history, repeating itself,  does  prove  that
       mankind goes on  from  one generation to another blindly closing its
       mind to new lines of thought only  because  he  does not or WILL NOT
       UNDERSTAND or grasp the situation and the laws involved.

       Just as those who should have known better rejected the telephone as
       impossible because, to  quote,  "It is impossible  to  transmit  the
       human voice over  a  copper wire."  That was true when the telephone
       was discovered by Josia Coppersmith, it is true today and it will


                                      Page 1

       always be true.  It is impossible to transmit the human voice over a
       copper wire.  Yet in spite of that, the telephone DOES WORK.

       One might even  go  so  far  as to state there is no such thing as a
       human voice, yet man transmits his  thoughts  to one another by what
       we commonly refer to as "speech" and "hearing" in spite  of the fact
       that man's vocal   chords   are   not  transmitters  of  other  than
       MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS and all the  so-called sound ORIGINATES in the
       skull of the hearer and NOT in the vocal chords of the speaker.

       As we asked  the  question over fifteen years ago,  we  repeat  that
       question now: "Why  should  man waste his time and efforts in trying
       to split the atom when nature is doing it all the time for us OUT IN
       SPACE?"

       Why not use the energy offered us  in  place  of  worrying about why
       grass is green in the hope it will discover for us  a  new source of
       energy which has  been  sitting  on  our  doorsteps  since the World
       began?

       The salt of the earth is ENERGY and  the evolution of MATTER and the
       evolution of FORCES (is carried out) in the process  of the creation
       of all things.   That  is something we all agree can be done, but do
       we understand that man can by the proper use of these same laws take
       energy and REVERSE ENERGY and CHANGE ENERGY INTO MATTER.

       It is not a question of finding new  elements,  but of being able to
       use energy and  matter  in  whatever  wave length  or  frequency  by
       letting nature do  our  "atom  splitting"  for  us.   It is cheaper,
       faster, more sure, and the potential  possibilities  far  exceed any
       puny efforts of man.

       I say puny,  for,  while  man  may  discover  new means  of  causing
       explosions and of  creating  explosives, he HAS NOT and CANNOT SPLIT
       THE ATOM.  It is merely a question  of  A  CHANGE  IN  FORM, no less
       matter and no less energy.  We separate energy only  to have it join
       elsewhere.

       If we can split the atom actually, we will have split the chain that
       holds the cycle  of  the  Universe  together  and,  like one drop of
       gasoline exploding all the other drops  of gasoline near it, so will
       the chain of atoms, go right on splitting EVERY OTHER  ATOM  of  the
       Universe, and that  CANNOT  BE  DONE  any more than one can compress
       water.

       In the laboratories of the Universe  we  find the uranium and radium
       series CHANGING from uranium to radium, radium into radon and radium
       A, B, C, C1, D (radio lead), radium E, F, and finally into lead, and
       if we follow the process, lead into gold and so on.

       In the laboratory WE HAVE CHANGED LEAD INTO GOLD  and  by  REVERSING
       THE PROCESS changed  lead  into  polonium or radium F.  If this step
       can be taken  EITHER WAY, is there  any  reason  why  further  steps
       cannot be taken?

       This is NOT  a case of splitting the atom, but merely  of  addition,
       multiplication, division and  subtraction of the COMBINATIONS OF THE
       ATOMS, but not the BREAKING into of the chain of the Universe.


                                      Page 2

       It is PLAIN EVOLUTION OF MATTER and EVOLUTION OF FORCES and there is
       no need in  highly  overestimating  the  accomplishment  under false
       interpretation of the facts.

       As frequency or oscillations is the  basis  of  the existence of all
       animal, vegetable and mineral matter, ONE COULD EXPLODE  MATTER FROM
       ANY DISTANCE to  which  the PROPER OSCILLATION could be transmitted.
       Our experiments have proven to our complete satisfaction that stores
       of ammunition on the land, in the  air  or  on  the  sea can be thus
       destroyed.

       Our experiments have also satisfied us that gravity  is  akin to, if
       not an electrical  oscillation  so  well balanced that we might, for
       the lack of a better name, almost call it a "Wattless Current" until
       some force is  exerted to OPPOSE  its  potential  and  then  GRAVITY
       OPPOSES SUCH FORCE.

       This means gravity can be CONTROLLED and unlimited  advancement made
       in air navigation,  with  the  only concern left being air speed and
       momentum.

       There is much of value to be developed  in fields that have not even
       been touched and about which very little is known in research in the
       atomic nucleus.  We  have  made  some  astounding   discoveries   in
       ARTIFICIAL RADIOACTIVITY set  up,  not by the usual expensive method
       with the cyclotron, but by the Moray method.

       A new world is to be entered through  ULTRASONICS,  HYPER  and ULTRA
       HIGH FREQUENCY CURRENTS  created  through the use  of  certain  tube
       discoveries working in IONIZATIONS as well as ELEC RONIC ACTION.

       Too little work  has been done with rays or frequencies around 10 to
       the 6th (10,000,000), through 10  to  the  5th  (1,000,000) Angstrom
       Units (A.U.).,  (one  AU is 10 to the 18th HZ or 10,000,000,000,000,
       000,000 HZ) no  doubt,  because the mechanical means used in working
       in this field has been attempted with  practically  the same type of
       equipment used in  the one-meter field.  We might  as  well  try  to
       carry water in a sieve.

       It is my  belief  that  Television  also  will  never  be a complete
       commercial success until the method  of  approach  is  changed  to a
       celestial wave rather than the present approach.

       One should not  enter these experimental fields in  the  GAMMA  BAND
       without the PROPER  PROTECTION,  for one will be risking his life in
       this work without a PROPER ABSORBER.

       Water, the common means of protection, has proven of little value as
       an absorber in most of our investigations.   Neither  has boric acid
       water or hydrogen gas proven too satisfactory as an absorber.

       In September, 1943,  a letter was written by us on transmutation  of
       metals to some  parties  interested  in mercury experiments, part of
       which letter follows :

         "In the reducing of colloids from  a  non-crystalline  state  to a
          crystalline state, the current and rays used must  be  such as to
          produce a  SYNCHRONOUS  ACTION.   It  is well know that colloidal
          "solutions" DO NOT OBEY SOLUTION LAWS; the alterations of the

                                      Page 3

          boiling and  freezing  points  are  inappreciable and the osmotic
          pressures very small.

          A colloidal solution is, in reality,  a DISPERSIVE SYSTEM, and in
          the case  of  attempting  to "knock down" the suspended  metallic
          colloid one  must  cause  what  might  be  called  COAGULATION or
          PRECIPITATION of  the  metallic   colloid   found   in   metallic
          sulphides, chlorides  or  salts  of a metal in a  NON-CRYSTALLINE
          FORM to a COAGULATED or CRYSTALLINE STATE.

          Now, whatever  frequency  of  current is used and whatever ray or
          rays are used, the frequency  of  the  current  and  of  the wave
          length of the ray or rays used SHOULD HARMONIZE so as to BLEND or
          SYNCHRONIZE with  the  NATURAL FREQUENCY or WAVE  LENGTH  OF  THE
          SUBSTANCE treated  so  as  to produce the SYNCHRONOUS ACTION that
          will set up a vibration for which  we might "coin" an experession
          and call this action a "SUPER-ULTRA SONIC REACTION"  between  the
          frequency of  the  current,  the  wave length of the ray, and the
          VIBRATORY RATE of the substance  treated  to  cause  the  desired
          METABOLIC or  CATALYTIC  REACTION  which will  result  in,  I  am
          convinced,  A COMPLETE CHANGE IN THE MODE OF MINING.

          That the  mining of the future will NOT be done in the crude ways
          of the  past.   Man's  work  with  animals,  vegetables,  fruits,
          flowers, and  all sorts of animal and vegetable  life  has  shown
          that he can improve on the things that nature produced.

          Man must  FIRST  go to Nature to LEARN, but then he must learn to
          IMPROVE over Nature's ways.  I  am  positively convinced that man
          can improve nature's mineral deposits by making  "colloids" grow,
          if one  does  not  object  to  such  an expression.  Or, in other
          words, SPEED UP NATURE'S ACTION  and  obtain  the  same or better
          results in a FRACTION OF THE TIME taken by nature.

          In the catalytic production of metals from colloids  one must not
          confuse this  process  with  the  evolution  of  forces  and  the
          evolution of matter, the former  being  the  process of "growing"
          from colloids,  the  latter  is  the actual phenomena  of  energy
          BECOMING MATTER  and matter, energy.  This still is not a process
          of splitting the atom, but CHANGING THE ARRANGEMENTS OF THEM.

          The real test of science in modern  destruction  lies  not in the
          explosion by  matter or matter by energy; but energy  BY  energy,
          "super" ultra sonics AGAINST the vibrations of matter.

       Vangard Notes...

          We have  noted  a most interesting series of parallels with other
          literature regarding  the  manifestation   and  transmutation  of
          matter which  seem  to  verify what Dr. Moray hints  at  in  this
          paper.

       Correlate 1

          The work  of Louis Kervran with the transmutation of calcium from
          food which had all the calcium  removed.   This  is a most famous
          experiment involving two groups of chickens.  One group was fed

                                      Page 4

          food with  absolutely  NO  CALCIUM, the other was fed normal food
          rich in calcium.

          The chickens eating the calcium  depleted  food  gave LARGER eggs
          with THICKER SHELLS than the ones who had normal calcium levels.

          The natural function of the chicken in the production  of the egg
          caused a  metabolic  fissioning  process to transmute the calcium
          from what was available.

          Kervran did many other experiments with other materials and found
          distinct progressions from one  element  to  another, both up and
          down the periodic table of the elements.

          Refer to the book, "Biological Transmutations" by Kervran.

       Correlate 2

          In an  occult  book  written  in the late 1800's  via  "automatic
          handwriting", mention  is  made of a process whereby aluminum was
          transmuted from clay.  The technique  required  the  clay  to  be
          "excited", presumably electrically, to the point of luminscence.

          The claim is that the "milepost or marker" which  causes the mass
          to take   on   the  characteristic  of  aluminum  is  temporarily
          "suspended".  At this time, the  "milepost"  of aluminum could be
          artifically broadcast INTO the "excited clay".

          As the mass was cooled, the mass characteristics would conform to
          those of  the  stronger aluminum marker and retain  that  pattern
          even after the excitation energies were removed.

          Refer to the book, "Dweller on Two Planets" by Phylos.

       Correlate 3

          Yet another interesting story is that of "Telluric Currents".  In
          the Middle  Ages,  it was believed that there were earth currents
          which carried vibrations characteristics  of  certain minerals or
          metals.  These  vibrations formed NODES in the  earth  where  the
          energies conjugated to form gold, calcium, copper, whatever...

          Owners of  mining  properties  would  deplete  the mine only to a
          certain extent, then seal it up  for at least 100 years.  When it
          was opened up 100 years later, the mineral or metal  veins  would
          have "re-grown" through the influence of the Telluric currents.

          Refer to  various  books  recounting  dowsing  stories as well as
          superstitions prevalent during the Middle Ages.

          Walter Russell went through a  30  day  period  of "illumination"
          during which  he  received  a  tremendous  amount   of   material
          regarding the Universe and its construction.

          He found  that  ALL  MATTER  followed  an  OCTAVE PROGRESSION and
          showed how music could be used to understand the various elements
          and their relationships.

          Refer to  the  books, "the Universal One" and "Atomic Suicide" by
          Walter Russell.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       The manifestation of matter from energy  and  back into energy again
       is a cycle which all Nature undergoes.  Einstein  was  far  from the
       first to recognize  this  in his famous E=MC2 formulation.  Everyone
       stands on the  shoulders  of  many   others   who  have  worked  and
       sacrificed for the  advancement  of human knowledge  throughout  the
       ages.

       Individual researchers do  much  to add to the overall knowledge but
       the TRUE BREAKTHROUGHS  come  from  the  ability  to  see  seemingly
       "unrelated" patterns across broad spectrums of information.

       This "hybridization" of  information  to  create something  FAR  and
       ABOVE any of  the  single  points below is well worth cultivating in
       one's personal life.

       Again, we see  the  wisdom  of  the   Divine   Tetractys.   How  the
       heterodyning of individual  actions  can  yield   both   a  sum  and
       difference action generally  on  a  higher order than the individual
       actions.  Thus, ESCAPE  TO  A  HIGHER  ORDER  takes  on  continually
       greater meaning.
