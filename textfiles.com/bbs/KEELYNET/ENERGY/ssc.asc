                                  THE DESKTOP SSC
               Scientific Speculation By Frederic B. Jueneman, FAIC
                  From Research & Development - Oct. 1987 Pg. 15

       Recent news about  the  53  mile circumference superconducting super
       collider has me  wondering  if particle  physicists  aren't  rubbing
       shoulders with the  astronomers.  It  seems  that  for  decades  the
       astronomers were the only group who had a firm grasp on megalomania.

       Even more recent  news  has  me thinking that solid state physicists
       are sharing some  schnapps  with the  genetic  and  recombinant  DNA
       community in contemplating the minuscule.

       Within the past   year  the  phenomenon  of  superconductivity   has
       captured the imagination of the global scientific community, and
       the media in  turn  have  infected  the  public  at  large  with the
       excitement of these  viral  discoveries.   And   now   solid   state
       aficionados are saying that future superconducting  super  colliders
       could share space on your desk next to the IBM "PC".

       As a practicing chemist for the better part of the past 30 years, my
       own druthers have  tended  towards  the  "small is beautiful" dictum
       because, as an analysts, my focus  has  been most naturally on atoms
       and molecules. Of  course,  I  hasten  to  add that  these  Notebook
       entries have acknowledged   from   time   to  time  somewhat  larger
       scenarios than the four walls of a laboratory.  But, the point being
       that I have built in empathy with the solid-staters.

       Last month I reiterated a 15 year  old  thought which suggested that
       an isotopically pure hexagonal crystal would present  to the view of
       an electron -  or  perhaps  another  charged  particle  - a coherent
       matrix of tunnels.

       And if an electron beam were passed  through  this  matrix symmetry,
       the array of atoms in the crystal lattice would act  as  waveguides,
       and what we  would  have  then  is  the  makings  of  a  solid state
       accelerator. In other words, a merging  of  particle and solid-state
       physics.

       For some years  prior  to 1972 I had been convinced  that  hexagonal
       crystals would exhibit  some  physical property that would be unique
       and separate from that of cubic crystals, which claim

                                      Page 1





       superconductivity as one    of    their    own    unique    physical
       characteristics.

       This new physical property of hexagonal  symmetry might be something
       never before observed in electron behavior in a lattice  matrix. And
       after a broad, albeit sketchy, search of the literature, I concluded
       that this new   characteristic  might  well  be  an  enhancement  of
       coherent dia-magnetism, or  - in  current  parlance  -  dia-magnetic
       amplification by stimulated  electron  emission  and   phased  array
       channeling. (However, it's   admitted   that  the  acronym  daseepac
       doesn't have the selling power of laser.)

       The history of  channeling  in crystals  goes  back  to  1912,  when
       Johannes Stark of  Germany  suggested  that  hydrogen   ions   would
       penetrate deeper into a lattice when directed from certain favorable
       angles.

       But Stark's concept  toward  elucidating the structure of matter was
       overshadowed by the coincidental discovery  of  x-ray diffraction by
       another German physicist, Max von Laue. And it wasn't  until some 40
       years later that Stark's idea ushered in the era of ion implantation
       in solid-state devices, where the theory was put into practical use.

       In the March 1968 issue of Scientific American, Werner Brandt of NYU
       described experiments with channeled proton beams, experiments which
       were originally initiated  by  Karl  Ove  Nielsen  and associates at
       Aarus, Denmark, in 1964. These experiments  showed  that "channeling
       resulted from the  correlated  deflections of the particles  in  the
       electrostatic-force field of  the  orderly  array  of  atoms  in the
       crystals". Resonances were found  at  distinct  proton energy levels
       and, as the energy was increased, the gamma-ray yield  rose  in  the
       channeling direction.

       Late in 1979  it  was  announced that Fermilab physicist Tim Toohig,
       and Edward Tsyganov of Dubna, near  Moscow,  collaborated on sending
       proton beams through   channels   in   monocrystals   grown   in   a
       microgravity space environment by cosmonauts. They found that if the
       crystals were also  very  carefully  bent, the proton beam - of tera
       electron volt (10E12) energy - would follow the curvature.

       This was the first demonstrated example  of  the waveguide nature of
       individual atoms in a coherent crystal lattice, and  the  initiating
       experiment into the   era  of  solid-state  accelerators.   But  the
       silicon, germanium, and silver crystals  used at Dubna, and grown in
       the Salyut space  laboratory,  are  commonly  cubic   in  form,  and
       therefore the lattice  structure symmetry may not be critical to the
       process of channeling as I had once  thought, although the hexagonal
       form should enhance this effect.

       Also, late in  1979,  a  team of scientists from Lawrence  Livermore
       National Lab, Stanford  Univ.,  and  Oak Ridge National Lab reported
       the tunable channeling  of  x  radiation   by  an  intense  beam  of
       electrons, using a silicon crystal.

       The x rays  are generated by the electrons as they undulate  through
       the channel lattice, and the x rays, themselves, are emitted only in
       the direction of electron travel.

       And what happens to the atoms in the crystal matrix during these

                                      Page 2





       high-energy excursions by  subatomic  particles?  Part of the answer
       might be contained in a note I wrote  to myself almost 20 years ago,
       in that "orientation  of  orbital electrons in a phased  matrix  may
       radically change the  structure of the crystal array by altering the
       quantum effects of the binding energy.  The crystal may become fluid
       in a quantum sense while retaining the relatively solid structure of
       a crystal matrix."

       And what this means is that there should be altered states of matter
       which are metastable while high-density particle fluxes  are passing
       through, probably pulsating  at  high frequencies with a concomitant
       distortion of space and time within discrete interatomic volumes.

       Taken as a whole, this is a mass effect,  whereas  the phenomenon of
       super-conductivity is a peripheral effect which does  not  penetrate
       very much below  the  surface of a conductor.  And as a mass effect,
       it would take  full  advantage of  incremental  space  described  by
       interatomic voids, whereas   contemporary   particle    accelerators
       utilize rather large evacuated chambers which approach free space in
       volume.

       A desktop super  collider  might  not  be  de rigueur for everyone's
       office, but it  would be a mite less  expensive  than  the  17  mile
       diameter variety and one heck of a lot more fun with  which  to play
       around.
