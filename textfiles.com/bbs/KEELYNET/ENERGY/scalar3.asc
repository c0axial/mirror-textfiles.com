     Vangard note...

         The following  file  deals with what is termed a "scalar" detector.
         We urge everyone to build this  circuit  and  share  your findings,
         observations and ideas as Joe has done.

         For those  of  us  who  have  been studying Free Energy  and  other
         phenomena for  so many years, it is refreshing to find someone like
         Joe who is willing to share some of his own experiments.

         Based on recent events, we expect  to see the free release of major
         discoveries in the field of tapping the virtual field In the next
         2 years OR LESS.  So, the following file is....ONLY THE BEGINNING.

         Many people are investigating this subject through  correlation  of
         textual and  historical  information,  while  a  few  are  actually
         building machines.   We urge the  release  of  the  information  no
         matter how it is derived, but with appropriate CAVEATS and warnings
         DESPITE the dangers inherent in CERTAIN VERSIONS.

         We also  URGE  that groups and individuals WORK TOGETHER  to  share
         their findings  with the express intent of releasing their findings
         to the public for verification on A LARGE SCALE.

         Please note  that  many seemingly  miraculous  machines  have  been
         invented and operated in the past 100 years that have ended up LOST
         because the inventors became overcome by EGO, POWER  OR  GREED,  or
         any combination  of  these  all  too common human traits.  Many say
         there are conspiracies and covert forces at work and that inventors
         will be killed should they "release" their information.

         With the  advent  of  computer   networks,   we  have  the  PERFECT
         DISTRIBUTION MECHANISM   that   will   within  minutes   put   this
         information across the globe.  TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT!

         One final point, if you want credit for your work, PUBLISH IT!

         Don't you  think  that  investors  will  look at your work, usually
         achieved while working on a financial  shoestring,  and wonder WHAT
         COULD THAT PERSON DO IF HE/SHE WERE BACKED WITH A REAL LAB???

         One other option, try the SHAREWARE approach.  Put out the plans,

         copyright to  prevent  alteration,  put in a "registration" fee and
         suggest that if the user finds these  plans of use, please register
         for $20  or $50.  People would be MORE than APPRECIATIVE  for  your
         work, knowing that you will continue your efforts with the incoming
         funds and sharing it with others because YOU ARE BEING COMPENSATED!

         So, if  you choose to build the following circuit, please share any
         anomalies, findings or ideas you  might have with us in the form of
         uploads or  messages.   You can upload files to KeelyNet,  you  can
         leave messages  to  ALL or to any specific person (Joseph Misiolek,
         not just JOE), voice or FAX transmissions to (214) 324-8741.  Thank
         you for your comments and ideas.

       Re:   Opto-Isolator IC SEP Detector
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     This device is a variant of the non-linear junction type detectors.  It
     has a few surprises that you will (hopefully)  discover  when you build
     it.
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

          1       Opto-Isolator IC (NEC PS2501-4)
                  16 pin dip
                  isolation voltage 5000
                  current transfer ratio 80%-600%
                  BVCEO 80 min.
                  ton = 3 usec.
                  toff= 5 usec.

          1       16 pin DIP socket
          1       BATTERY POWERED variable DC power supply (regulated)
          1       Oscilloscope
          1       Circuit board
          1       metal box (suitable for housing RF circuits)
          2       RCA phono jacks (shielded)
          2       RCA phono plugs (shielded)

          misc.   coax cable, solder, etc.

     Put the whole  thing into the shielded box.  There should  be  no  gaps
     where the box halves join or anywhere else that vector EM signals might
     leak through to  the detector.  It must be completely shielded from all
     vector EM radiation.  Connect the  IC  to  RCA  type  jacks using short
     pieces of coax.   Follow  the  connection  scheme  below.    Use   good
     construction practices (short leads, well shielded and good solder
     connections are a must.) Plug coax into the jacks and run the cables
     out to the power supply and scope as shown.

     Theory of operation:

     As you may  well  know,  non-linear  mediums  will translate scalar EM.
     This can be exploited in most semi-conductors  due  to  the highly non-
     linear junction region present where N and P type materials interface.

     We have three such junctions in this detector.  One junction in the LED
     and two in the phototransistor.  When the LED is biased  just enough to
     put it into  'starvation mode', electrons begin their quantum tunneling
     across the junction.

     Scalar wavefronts passing through the junction translate into vector EM
     which couples with the tunneling electrons altering their quantum wells
     in the P type material they 'fall in'  radiating their excess energy in
     the process.

     The photons emitted contain the scalar information which coupled to the
     electron during the tunneling process.  This information  is carried by
     the photon to  the  base  of the photo-transistor where it is converted
     into a vector EM signal and sent to the scope for analysis.

     Enterprising researchers may want to amplify the signal before sending
     it to the scope.  This is up to you.  If you do decide to try this, use
     high-impedance JFET input op-amps for the task.

        ÈÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼

           Operation:

         Start with the power supply at  zero  volts  dc and the scope sweep
         rate somewhere   around  10  KHz/cm  on  the  scale.    Set   scope
         sensitivity to highest range (.01 v/cm or better.)

         Slowly begin  raising  the dc bias to the LED keeping careful watch
         on the scope.


                                      Page 3





         At the point where the LED just starts to conduct (starvation mode)
         you will  begin  to see signals on the scope.  Adjust dc bias until
         you get the best detection.

         Adjust the scope sweep rate until you see the most signal detail.
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Observations:

     1. You will note that the signals  are  not  vector  EM for THEY CANNOT
        penetrate the shielded box to interact with your detector.

     2. They are not the result of a ground loop because you are running
        from batteries.

     3. They are not from the battery supply because there is 5000 volts
        of isolation between the emitter and detector portion of the IC.

     Here is the BIG TEST.......

     This device will operate for approximately 10 minutes before failing.
     You will notice however that the IC will still function as an opto-
     isolator when placed into a conventional circuit.  It simply won't
     detect anymore.

     Anyone here who can adequately describe in a private letter to me why
     this is so will be given the next detector plans which are quite a bit
     more advanced.

     Good luck to all!
