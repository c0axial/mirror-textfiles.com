THINK BIG

Imagine a sort of ideal gas made of one size of particles.  Suppose that it
has been all stirred up and contains lots of waves and vortices.  The vortices
themselves can also behave like particles and can propagate waves too, but
this is a second order effect and the velocity will be lower than the waves in
the gas itself.

It is further possible for the waves in the vortices to produce further
vortices and again the velocity will be slower.  This process can occur
without limit if we have enough gas and enough time to stir and observe.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE AETHER

Now I want to suggest that the universe is filled with a gas which is
something like this and I will call it the aether.  This aether will have a
wave propagation speed of about 10^15 cm/s which is very much faster than
light.  The field which is represented by the pressure of the aether is I
think the gravitational field of GR.

Note that I am suggesting that gravity waves propagate at a much higher
velocity than the conventional idea, but there is no observational evidence
that this is wrong, and it is in good agreement with the commonsense
observation concerning the direction of the gravitational field.  The
traditional view of this is different in theory but not in practice.

The locations that we observe to have matter are actually low density aether
regions.  A black hole would be an aether vacuum.  This is similar to a
tornado having a very low internal pressure and density.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE ETHER

The vortices which exist in the aether can interact also and as a result they
make another field.  I will call this the ether.  It will be the ether of
Maxwell's theory that carries the elctromagnetic fields.  It has a propagation
velocity that we call the speed of light, but does vary from place to place
depending on the density and pressure of the aether.  This is why space is
considered bent by gravity in GR, but it is better to think of space as
straight and the velocity of light as variable.

Note that the spelling of Aether for grAvity and Ether for Electromagnetism
was chosen as an easy memory aid.

The subject of vortices and the equations which apply to them were fully
calculated by Kelvin in 1880 and lead to exactly the correct equations for
electromagnetism as explained by Paul Stowe in a recent post.  He also reports
that this is covered in "A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity"
by E Whitaker, Dover, 1989.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MATTER

When the ether forms another level of vortices it produces what we call
matter.  Matter can also support travelling waves which we call sound, and
again the speed of propagation of these is very much less than for the level
above which is light.

It is interesting that matter comes in different states of solid, liquid and
gas which relate to the degrees of freedom that each particle has for its
motion.  One wonders whether the ether can also have such different states
under different conditions.  We may only have ever observed one of these in
our part of the universe.

When we talk about pressure and temperature we mean these to apply to matter,
but the ether and aether would also have these properties.  Evidence of this
is the already mentioned variation of c near massive bodies.  The speed of
propagation of waves depends on the temperature of the medium.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MORE LEVELS

There is evidence for a further level of slower waves below sound.  Heat
travels at a much slower speed and may be considered to be the next property
in the sequence: gravity, light, sound, heat.  It is probable that matter
would need to be in an extremely energetic environment for the next level of
substance to fully manifest itself.

Such conditions do not exist on earth but might do so inside stars.  If they
did then we would expect another much slower oscillation in the sun than the
ones related to sound which take minutes.  The sunspot cycle is of the right
order of length.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VARIATIONS WITHIN LEVELS

The speed of light is not a constant.  Each substance has a different speed
for light and this is usually expressed (inversely) as the refractive index of
the substance.  There are concentrations of different speeds for light around
certain values which are in simple ratios to the speed in vacuum.

For example, the refractive index of water at 18 degrees is 1.3333 or 4/3
while many substances have refractive indices near 1.50 and 2.00.  The rule is
not absolute, but may be considered to be a bit like Dalton's atomic weights
which tended to be integers but were complicated by isotope mixtures.

Again, the speed of sound in different materials clusters around certain
velocities that are also in simple proportions to each other such as 12, 6 and
3 km/s.  Interestingly these are some of the same velocities as reported in
redshift quanta and seem to also be related to typical stellar velocities and
planetary velocity quanta.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RATIO STRUCTURE

A similar structure is found for the speed of heat in different materials.
Furthermore the ratio of velocities light/sound and sound/heat are of the
order of 10^4.5 to 10^5 which is a similar ratio to the scale difference of
the distances between many structures in the universe in the sequence:
observed universe, galaxy, star, planet, moon and also atom, baryon.

Both the existence of this large ratio and the small ratios of speed in
different substances are consistent with my Harmonic theory predictions for
spacial and time structures and suggests that a common cause such as the above
explanation does exist for all these phenomena.  See my WWW pages for a
description of the Harmonics theory (URL below).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPEED OF GRAVITY

If the structure found in the velocities is indeed based on the Harmonics
theory then it follows that light cannot be the fastest thing.  It seems that
the step faster than light should be gravity.  Its speed can be calculated as
about 1x10^15 cm/s.  It seems very likely that gravity is the first order
component of these vortices as it has a different and simpler form.  Therefore
I expect that there are no more faster levels, but this could well be wrong.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BASIS OF CHARGE

Because matter is made of vortices of vortices in this proposition there will
be more possibilities than for the first level of vortices.  The way that the
larger and smaller vortices align or not could be the basis of charge.  It
would be interesting to know whether phonons also exhibit some more
complicated quantum properties as a third level wave.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VORTEX OR SOLID AETHER

It is also possible to consider the aether as being solid.  A similar
structure can be determined as waves and waves of standing waves.  This
account should be considered as possibly applying to either, but because the
mathematics of the vortex theory has been proven to fit EM theory that option
was chosen for this article.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FASTER THAN LIGHT

But hasn't it been proven that nothing can go faster than light?  No it has
not.  It has been proven that no electromagnetic influence can go faster than
light.  This is a consequence of Maxwell's equations which apply only to the
second level of the aether/ether field.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ETHER REST FRAME

If I have correctly identified the highest level aether as the medium for
gravity then it might be possible to send signals faster than light by using
gravity waves.  If only we could detect them.  Perhaps existing experiments
are looking at the wrong frequencies or wavelengths because of using the wrong
speed for gravity?

Again there is the question of whether faster than light travel would violate
causality?  The answer is that it would not, provided that there is a
preferred reference frame in which the faster velocity occurs.  There is.  It
is the ether rest frame.  Note that even if we could detect the ether rest
frame we could not detect the aether rest frame.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RELATIVITY

There is nothing in the above which disagrees with the predictions of
relativity except perhaps whether gravity travels at more than c.  However it
is worth mentioning that special relativity is really based on
electromagnetism in the form of Maxwell's equations and general relativity
includes the form of gravity but is not dependant on its velocity which it
just assumes to be the same.

So the above should all be consistent with existing theory.  However it does
open up the possibility of extending theory into new areas.  It also allows
the possibility of uniting gravity with electromagnetism.
