The following file relates to the possibility of dimensional and time travel
such as in INCUNAB1, INCUNAB2 and ONGSHAT on KeelyNet.  It is odd that topics
we talk about on the computer networks wind up on TV or as movies within 6
months to 2 years of the discussion.  Many people have been opening up to the
possibilities of these multiple 'quantum realities' that CO-EXIST with us.

If that is the case, we should be able to transport there and return.  Tom
Beardens' 'Excalibur Briefing' calls such transports 'tulpoids' as they are
energetically linked to their 'homeworld' or 'space-time', thus returning when
no longer energetically excited at the level needed to create and sustain the
transport.  We continue to collect information in this area that will be
provided as files and email........................................>>>  Jerry

Subject: 4-D :: NOT on Behalf of the Government
Date   : Mon, 20 Mar 1995 19:50:42 GMT

Does the idea of a Galactic Federation sound cozy to you?  It's meant to.  The
notion was generated out of whole cloth by some government psy-contractors,
including the Commander X stuff and all the rest.

Like Mssrs. English, Lear, et al, these things are entirely diversionary and
meant to keep your eyes glued to the "page" rather than looking at reality.
"Psyops has more eyes than cyclops." Their motto.

The same with this photon belt stuff, and all the other pet discussions that
take up so much of your conscious time.  Many, many abductions have been
staged by perfectly human aliens administering potent drugs and adjunct
hypnosis, to keep alive enough of the discussion to make a mockery of the
subject.  Anything to keep you from looking at the skies, and especially the
moon, with any serious regularity.

My friends, these people are not amateurs.  They are professional enough to
know that it isn't quality, but quantity that works for them.  And they make
no secret of it, if you just look with an open mind.  But they are counting on
cultural boundaries to make sure that anyone with an open mind finds
themselves on the wrong side of the tracks to be taken seriously.

Cover up?  Not really.  Reality spin, they call it.

Now I am going to tell you about the nature of the aliens, and what their
presence means to us specifically, rather than go into the history of their
doings during our past.  The aliens are immortal.

That's the KEYWORD: immortal.  Taste it.  Feel it.  Breathe it.  Their
psychology does not operate on the same lines as ours because of this
incomparable difference.  Maybe that's why they count as aliens, eh?  And it
was this little notion that was the source of some of the content of the movie
Cocoon.

But stop and think about this: if everyone could be immortal, what would be
the point of just about everything we now do as a culture?

Everything in our culture is geared to the transmission of information past
the barrier of death, from one generation to another.  Suppose that were no
longer necessary?  And imagine the population issues, not to mention who gets
the alien elixir of life and who doesn't.

Who owns what when no one ever dies?  How does a growth economy shape up in
the long run when there are enough people living to shake out the lies and see
the inequities?

You get the picture, I am sure.  The alien technology is almost superfluous
when compared with this root condition.  The disinfo put out about the Dulce
facility toys with this: body parts floating in tanks, etc.  Yes, you too can
live forever (you do anyway, but at the moment you've forgotten), but you
can't keep your human body.

The aliens have the technology to join mind to matter, to perpetuate the
transmission of consciousness through extremely refined methods.

But individual bodies don't matter [pun, :)].  They come and go, like you and
I buy clothes, and the embodied consciousness simply migrates. That is the
deal,and the "threat."

Now, the technology.  What the government has in its possession are devices
related to the warping of time and space.  JUST COINCIDENTALLY, (yeah, right),
they have discovered that these devices INFORM consciousness.  Well, surprise.

Pure organic process philosophy is about the most ancient thing on this
planet.  What this means is that it is possible for you to be anywhere,
anytime, anything, all relatively speaking.  You can get lost down through the
ages, and more than one of our service "voluteers" has.  There is an "edge"
beyond which human consciousness cannot go without losing touch.

Flying saucers floating between the stars?  I liked sandboxes when I was
young, too.  These devices are not about going to Sirius, though you could if
you were silly enough to want to waste the opportunity.

And that's what the military has been doing!  Treating these things as
transportation devices, which is like using the transporter on the Enterprise
only to deliver your morning paper.  But they don't have the mind
consciousness that the aliens have, the ability to recognize timelines the way
an immortal being does.  So they push the engines laterally, so to speak.

What you saw in the movie My Science Project was no joke, but yet another
carefully crafted revelation of information, as was the Philadelphia
Experiment flick.

That bit in the movie Navigator when the kid's brain is loaded with
starcharts?  Same old, same old.  Just "coincidentally" the movie ends with
the kid traveling back through time (it's hard on him!) to an alternate
outcome?  These are not cinematic fantasies, but carefully projected in-
formations.  And what devices do you suppose they are using to put the ideas
out into the ether?!

This is what is out in the Nevada desert, up in Alaska, Idaho, Texas (the
supercollider wasn't cancelled for no reason, like SETI), and even a few
selectively purchased remote areas of foreign countries.  What tune is the
Taos hum humming?

There is even physical proof of the use of this technology, all over the
place.  Find a human tooth encased in a virgin piece of coal?  Find a
sparkplug in a geode?  Find anachronistic pieces of technology beneath a lava
flow that is 10,000 years old?  And so on.  The early experiments with the
"engines" caused these "fragtures" as they are called in the jargon.

Little rips in time/space from a linear point of view.  Trying to be in two
places at once, from the 4-D view.  And people just didn't come back. Put a
happy face on that!

The really tough part is that they cannot control this.  They turn it on and
hope for the best, basically speaking.  What they have only begun to realize
is that the earth "science" they grew up with is hopelessly inadequate to
develop the true potential of something that seems to create reality.

It doesn't really, but it requires a broader consciousness than they have had
at their disposal!  And now they are about to turn it on again, bigtime, in
Alaska (HAARP?).  And the people working on this don't even understand what
they are doing except following "the professor's" instructions.

Part of their reticence about broadening intellectual access is that they
themselves can't understand it, and they sure as hell don't want somebody off
the street to do better.  Also, it has been an article of faith that nations
excluded from this would go to war out of sheer effrontery!

And, if there is any curiosity, I'll extend this further.  If I am allowed to.
How can I recognize that what I see is not an effect of the machinery?  You
learn the taste of the "pressure" to believe.
