   phase-conjugate mirror                   (more below...)


   Hi Jerry--    Message  #4167  from  Dillon  Ridgward  got me thinking about
   Phase-Conjugate reflection again...  If  it's a REFLECTION, and must always
   re-CONVERGE at its source, how can we possibly use it as a beam generator?

   Well, maybe  all  we  need  to do is stick a beam-splitter  (a  transparent
   mirror) in  the  path  so that some of the PC reflected beam gets reflected
   out at 90 degrees.  Then, since it would soon converge to a focal point, we
   need to DIVERGE it a bit with a diverging  lens,  so that the beam can stay
   straight for a distance. Perhaps it could converge, say,  100 feet away and
   burn a  time-reversed  hole  in your mother-in-law's bloomers, or something
   similar.

   Maybe this is simple to you but it hadn't occurred to me until now how
   we would get that beam to come out of the thing!

   Dillon's message was about doing this at RF frequencies, but you get
   the point.
