                BACKGROUND FOR PURSUING SCALAR ELECTROMAGNETICS

                                 T. E. Bearden
                                 February 1992

                                     Note

       This informal  paper is  augmented and adapted from a letter to a
       young senior in EE, who was planning to pursue his doctorate, and
       asked for  advice in  understanding the  scalar  electromagnetics
       area and  choosing either  physics or  EE as  a major.  The reply
       back to  the student  enclosed several  formal background papers.
       [1][2]  This paper is a sort of "executive summary" of scalar EM.

                               To Correspondent

       Delighted to  see you  are interested  in the  material  and  the
       approach; I  will try to give you some quick answers to your main
       questions.

       Best is to simply start with my latest book, Gravitobiology, from
       the Tesla Book Co., POB 12183, Chula Vista, CA 91912, phone (619)
       426-8213.

                         Two Kinds of Electromagnetics

       Specifically, you must understand that there are two kinds of EM.
       One is  flawed and in the normal textbooks, and you will study it
       in your  education process.   The  other  kind  is  not  in  your
       textbooks at all, but it is in some good technical papers, if you
       know what  they are,  what to read, and how to put them together.
       By  the   time  you   get  your   doctorate,   hopefully   scalar
       electromagnetics will  be in  fashion  at  most  of  the  leading
       universities.

       For the  second, unknown  kind of  EM, you  should read  the  two
       Whittaker papers  bound in as Annexes to the Gravitobiology book.
       [3][4]  They give you the basic theory you need, for the internal
       EM and  for scalar EM potential interferometry.  Study them until
       the material is coming out of your ears in your sleep.

                 Internal EM Structure of the Scalar Potential

       Briefly, Whittaker  shows you  that  a  scalar  EM  potential  is
       comprised of  bidirectional EM  wave pairs,  where the  pairs are
       harmonics  and   phase-locked  together.      In   each   coupled
       wave/antiwave pair,  a true  forward-time EM wave is coupled to a
       time-reversal of  itself __ its phase conjugate replica antiwave.
       The two waves are spatially in phase, but temporally they are 180
       degrees out  of phase.   That  combined energy  thus stresses the
       "time dimension',  and in  fact alters  the local rate of flow of
       time itself.   Please  note how  fundamental that  statement  is.
       Everything may be said to exist in time, or "move along in time,"
       or to "be in linear motion along the time axis."  When you stress
       and alter  the rate  of flow  of time,  you also affect all those
       time-present things  such as  inertia of  an object,  mass of the
       object, its  angular momentum,  clock rates,  etc.   You directly
       engineer local  general relativity,  and you  electromagnetically
       curve local spacetime.

                  Time Reversal and the Time-Reversed EM Wave

       You must  understand time-reversal  and the time-reversed EM wave
       [5] itself,  including the  theory of  the phase conjugate mirror
       and of the pumped phase conjugate mirror (from nonlinear optics.)
       Yariv  [6]   Chapter  16  and  Pepper  [7][8]  are  key  to  that
       understanding.  Study these references also until the material is
       coming out of your ears in your sleep.

       Also study Sachs' overview of time reversal in physics. [9]  Here
       you will  find that  time-reversal still isn't well understood at
       all, but  Sachs does  a marvelous job in presenting what is known
       and used.  You should also realize that a time-reversed (TR) wave
       is seen by the observer in his own "forward time."  Hence he sees
       the wave spatially reversed.  In short, he sees the same thing as
       he would  see if  a movie  __ of  the wave expressed as a forward
       time wave __ were simply reversed.  So the TR wave ever-converges
       on its  course, rather  than diverges.   Convergence is the time-
       reversal of  divergence.   Apply similar  TR processes  to  other
       characteristics of  a normal  wave, by letting the movie film run
       backward in  your mind.   Notice particularly what happens to the
       forward-time entropy  of scattered waves __ it becomes negentropy
       when you  time-reverse the  scattered waves.    You  can  recover
       "order" or  "energy" even after it's been scattered in performing
       work, by  phase conjugate  reflection.   And then  you can use it
       again.   Remember, every  system is  driven, with continual input
       and output  of energy.   We are not violating the conservation of
       energy of  a closed  system, because  we are  not talking about a
       closed system.

                        Destroy the Mystique of Entropy

       Remove in  your mind  the neo-religious  mystique built up around
       the entropy  concept.  The two serious postulations (assumptions)
       of entropy  are (1)  every component  is a  forward-time critter,
       with no  time-reversed critters  allowed, and (2) random variable
       statistics is assumed a priori.  With the Whittaker decomposition
       of the  scalar potential  into a surprising and perfectly ordered
       set of  harmonic biwave  pairs, you  have blown  away the  random
       variable  statistics  assumption.    By  phase  conjugate  mirror

                                      Page 2

       production of  time-reversed EM  waves, you  have blown  away the
       forward-time assumption.   So  entropy isn't  what it used to be,
       and  the   second  law  of  thermodynamics  is  not  a  mystical,
       irrevocable law  of nature  at all.   To  believe that  it is, is
       dogma, not  science.   Entropy can  be transformed  directly into
       negentropy, and  negentropy can even be amplified.  Specifically,
       the pumped phase conjugate mirror does exactly that.

                   Statistical Gravitons and Coupled Photons

       Then consider  the Whittaker EM biwave structure of the potential
       again, from the particle viewpoint.  The wave is made of photons,
       and the  antiwave is  made of  antiphotons.   Since the  wave and
       antiwave in  each set  are perfectly  correlated, so  must be the
       photons/antiphotons.   The waves  are passing through each other,
       so to  speak, in  the time  dimension only.   They  are perfectly
       coordinated spatially.   Thus so are the photon/antiphoton pairs.
       That is, the photons and antiphotons are continually coupling and
       decoupling,  in   each  wave/antiwave   pair.     Since  all  the
       wave/antiwave sets  are phase-locked,  then one  has the  unusual
       feature that  this potential  in the local spacetime has formed a
       spacetime  lattice,   perfectly  organized   both  spatially  and
       temporally.   Further, when  a photon and antiphoton are coupled,
       the resulting  system has  helicity-2.   This spin-2  entity is a
       graviton.   However, it  is not  a hard  particle, because  it is
       continually forming  and unforming.   Hence  it is  a statistical
       graviton.     Occasionally,  more   than  two   photons   couple;
       occasionally  the   coupling  opportunity  is  missed.    We  are
       interested in  the average  coupling's spin  value; that  may  be
       either  integral  or  fractional.    What  is  happening  in  the
       Whittaker  spacetime  lattice  __  with  respect  to  the  photon
       coupling and decoupling __ is that energy is oscillating back and
       forth between  expression as  EM energy/order (photons decoupled)
       and expression as gravitational energy/order (photons coupled).

       The statistical  graviton process  is not  confined to helicity-2
       gravitons, since  the spin-2  value just  represents the  average
       coupling.   Spin-2 statistical  gravitons represent  or produce a
       flat local  spacetime,  since  the  lattice  has  no  surplus  or
       shortage of either photons or antiphotons.  Indeed, we may regard
       the coupled  photons and  antiphotons as a special sort of "Dirac
       sea," similar  to the  Dirac sea  of negative  energy  electrons.
       Depending upon  the helicity, the spacetime may have an excess of
       deficiency of  photons, in  which case  it is  said to be curved.
       Also, it  can thus  serve as  a source  or a sink, depending upon
       whether the hidden photon sea has a surplus or a deficiency.

                   Graviton Helicity and Spacetime Curvature

       Note that  we are  often using  the term "photons" to mean either
       photons or antiphotons.

       If in the statistical graviton we increase the photon coupling to
       __ say  __ 2.1  photons average,  then this provides gravitons of
       spin 2.1.   In  this case the local spacetime is curved, since it
       has an  excess EM  energy density,  as compared to normal ambient
       vacuum.   It has  an excess of photons, so to speak, and can thus
       serve as  a photon source (an EM energy source).  If the averaged
       coupling is  1.9, say,  then the local spacetime is curved in the

                                      Page 3

       opposite direction.   In  that case,  the vacuum  is deficient in
       photons, and can act as a sink for EM energy.

              An Asymmetrical Vacuum Violates Local Conservation

       In a  locally curved  spacetime, then,  one may  have  either  an
       energy source  or an energy sink, depending upon how one makes or
       engineers  this  local  vacuum/spacetime.    In  a  curved  local
       spacetime, the  local vacuum/spacetime  interacts directly with a
       system placed  there, and  it can  be designed  to produce either
       extra energy  in the  system or absorb energy from the system.  A
       curved local spacetime is a locally asymmetrical spacetime.  With
       this violation  of symmetry, most of the conservation laws can be
       broken locally.  One can readily have magnetic monopoles also, in
       such a  locally curved  system. [10]  These violated laws include
       conservation  of  energy,  electrical  charge,  magnetic  charge,
       momentum, etc.   The  vacuum itself becomes an engine, to perform
       work upon the system.

                  Using the Inner Hidden EM Order of Entropy

       With the pumped phase conjugate mirror concept, you can decompose
       negentropic EM  scattering stress energy (even heat) into ordered
       bidirectional sets  of Whittaker waves, use these Whittaker waves
       as  pump  waves  inputting  to  a  phase  conjugate  mirror(PCM),
       "tickle" the  PCM with  a very small "signal" wave input, and get
       out all  of the  entropic pump energy back in perfect order, as a
       powerfully amplified  time-reversed phase conjugate replica (PCR)
       of the little signal wave.

       If you  look in  that fashion  at Tesla's  magnifying transmitter
       that he  built on  Long Island,  you will  see that  he really is
       treating the earth itself as a pumped phase conjugate mirror, and
       he is  using his  transmitter to provide a stimulus wave into the
       earth.   When things are done right (there's also one or two more
       requirements),  when   so  stimulated  the  scalar  EM  potential
       represented by  the heat  and  pressure  energy  of  the  earth's
       interior will  partially organize  itself internally  as sets  of
       Whittaker  pump  waves.    The  combination  of  these  Whittaker
       bidirectional EM  waves and  the highly nonlinear material of the
       earth  then  become  a  pumped  phase  conjugate  mirror  (PPCM).
       Tesla's transmitter  is furnishing  the "stimulus"  wave to cause
       internal Whittaker bidirectional self-ordering to occur (actually
       through nonlinear harmonic and subharmonic resonance).

       Now suppose  the earth has been "stimulated" in this fashion, and
       has become a PPCM earth.  By standard, orthodox, nonlinear optics
       theory, proved  by thousands  of experiments  and papers  in  the
       literature, you  can then  input a  small "signal  wave"  from  a
       distant transmitter  anywhere on  earth, at the distant locality,
       and there  you will receive back from the PPCM earth an amplified
       phase conjugate  replica (PCR)  wave, with  far more energy in it
       than you  put in,  in your  signal wave.   So you can use Tesla's
       approach to  directly organize  the enormous  heat  and  pressure
       energy of  the  earth,  forming  them  (considered  as  a  scalar
       potential) into  a giant  "standing Whittaker  pump wave"  in the
       earth, and  tap that  Whittaker wave  anywhere else  in the world
       that you  transmit in  another little signal wave.  In late April
       to early  May of  1985, Frank  Golden detected  and measured  the

                                      Page 4

       Soviets doing  precisely that,  on  27  pairs  of  EM  pump  wave
       frequencies,  12   kilohertz  apart.   [11]    Almost  incredible
       electrical power  was being  extracted from  the earth,  to power
       enormous Soviet  directed energy  weapons as  part of the May Day
       celebrations for  the 40th anniversary of the end of World War II
       against the Nazis.

               Pumped Phase Conjugation as a Negentropic Process

       In other words, you can defeat entropy disordering by this pumped
       PCM means.  You do it by turning positive (scattering) (entropic)
       energy of  the pump waves into negative (gathering) (negentropic)
       energy of  the amplified  PCR wave.  Note that almost all of what
       you were  taught about entropy assumes that all components of the
       entropic system  are time-forward  components, and  that none  of
       them are  time-reversed components.   It  would be  nice  if  the
       leading thermodynamics  experts would do some real hard work with
       Whittaker potentials,  internal EM  biwave structures  of  scalar
       potentials,  PCMs,   pumped  PCMs,  and  time-reversed  waves  in
       general, not  just at  optical frequencies,  and  not  just  with
       obscure electro-optical devices.

                   Time Reversal and Correction of Disorder

       Be sure  you  understand  Yariv's  statement  of  the  distortion
       correction theorem.  [12]   The principle is awkwardly named, but
       it contains the gist of engineerable negentropy.  Read it and say
       it  over   and  over,   until  your  mind  grasps  its  fantastic
       implications.   You can  easily make  a wave  that  will  restore
       former order  after the  scattering of  that order.  Realize also
       that the  time-reversed wave  is a  general solution  to the wave
       equation.  Any kind of wave __ EM, sound, mechanical, whatever __
       can be phase-conjugated/time-reversed in this manner.  In his New
       York  lab,   Tesla  apparently  did  it  first,  with  mechanical
       vibration waves,  before the turn of the century. [13]  His later
       telegeodynamics  [14]   actually  envisioned  the  use  of  time-
       reversed, laser-like  mechanical waves  that traveled through the
       earth's crust  to a distant point.  He also understood the use of
       two such  beams from separated separate transmitters, so that the
       beams met  and crossed  at that distant point, to reproduce __ by
       scalar interferometry  __ the  mechanical effects desired at that
       point.  Whittaker's 1904 paper will show you that interference of
       two such  scalar potentials  will indeed  produce ordinary  force
       fields in  the interference zone.  You can fairly readily produce
       force fields  at a  distance.   By calculation  of  the  form  of
       potential needed,  you can  even produce  them in  the  geometric
       patterns and  directions you  wish.  Ball lightning, e.g., is one
       of   nature's   ways   of   using   distance-independent   scalar
       interferometry to produce such stabilized geometrical forms of EM
       energy.  Try finding any other laboratory-testable explanation of
       ball  lightning   in  the   physics  and  electrical  engineering
       curricula!

                    Whittaker and the Aharonov-Bohm Effect

       You must  also understand  what the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect is.
       Read carefully  the cited  AB 1959  paper. [15]   You  must  also
       comprehend the  fact that  Whittaker's work  in 1903 and 1904 had
       already anticipated  the AB  effect, and  drastically extended it

                                      Page 5

       engineerably and  in  a  distance-independent  manner,  into  the
       macroscopic world,  far beyond  the several thousand angstroms to
       which it has now been laboriously proven by modern physicists.

                      A Basic Knowledge of Atomic Nuclei

       You  need  to  know  a  little  something  about  atomic  nuclei,
       isotopes, isomers,  etc.    A  variety  of  introductory  nuclear
       physics or  nuclear engineering books have the necessary material
       in a few chapters.

                     Vacuum Is a Plenum, Not an Emptiness

       You need  to also  understand what  the vacuum  is.  My own later
       work will  give you  an overall  grasp of  that, and  for  deeper
       understanding you  can check cited references that appeal to you.
       [16][17][18][19][20]     I  warn  you  that  we've  all  been  so
       conditioned  to   think  of   the  vacuum  as  "nothing"  and  an
       "emptiness," that  it takes some doing to overcome that deep-set,
       unconscious bias in one's own thinking.

                The Major Physics Disciplines Are Inconsistent

       You need  to be  aware  that  there  are  serious  conflicts  and
       inconsistences    existing     between    general     relativity,
       electromagnetics, and  quantum mechanics.  [21]   Physics is  not
       unified, and  it is  not even  consistent.   No one, for example,
       even knows  what a  photon really  is. [22]   It  is not  just  a
       localized particle,  that much  is sure;  it's more  like a delta
       appearing in the calculated constant of each frequency term in an
       infinite Fourier  expansion series.  In fact we've got four major
       photon models, all different, and we just plug in whichever model
       has been  found to  give  the  right  answers  for  a  particular
       application. [23]  As another example, the field concept is known
       to be  fundamentally in  error, but  it  is  so  useful  that  it
       continues to be widely utilized. [24]

                        Force Fields Versus Potentials

       The conflict  between QM  and  EM  is  particularly  poignant  in
       regards to  what causes  electromagnetic phenomena  in the  first
       place.  [25]     In  classical  EM  theory  the  forcefields  are
       considered the  primary causes,  and the potentials are just sort
       of mathematical conveniences.  In quantum mechanics, however, you
       have exactly  the contrary  view.   There, the potentials are the
       primary causes,  and the  force  fields  are  secondary  effects,
       created in the charged particle system itself by the interference
       there of the potentials.  Vacuum is pure potential, nothing else.
       [26]   The forcefields  do not even exist in the vacuum, but only
       in  the  charged  particle   system  itself,   with   which   the
       potentialized vacuum interacts.

       You cannot  have the  classic EM  force field  in the  vacuum,  a
       priori.   You can't  and don't have a force field except when you
       introduce a charge into a potential gradient.  There's never been
       an E-field  or a  B-field in  the vacuum as such; never has been,
       and never will be.  The classical EM model is flat wrong on that.



                                      Page 6

       Even Feynman  pointed out  in his  three volumes  of physics that
       only the  potential for  the forcefield exists in the vacuum, not
       the forcefield itself. [27]  You've got to understand this point.
       The inclusion  of vacuum  forcefields  is  a  major  screw-up  in
       classical EM  that prevents  real understanding  of the  vacuum's
       potentialization and local interaction with physical systems.

       Take the  definition of  an E-field:  E = F/q, where q is charged
       mass.   If you  don't have  any charged  mass, you can't possibly
       have any  force per  unit charged  mass, from  the  definition  a
       priori.   Try an analogy where E is the number of fish per bucket
       of water,  F is  the number  of fish in all the buckets of water,
       and q  is the number of buckets of water.  If you have no buckets
       of water  at all,  for example, you cannot possibly have any fish
       per bucket of water, a priori.  If you have a lot of fish around,
       but no buckets of water, however, you have the potential for fish
       per bucket  of water,  should you  bring in some buckets of water
       and couple the fish to them (put them in the buckets of water).

                         The Quantum Mechanical Vacuum

       To understand  what is  in the vacuum, you need to appreciate the
       quantum mechanical view of the vacuum.  In that view, spontaneous
       creation and  annihilation of  particles occur  at an  incredible
       rate.   Each particle is formed, then disappears, so quickly that
       it cannot  be individually  observed.  But it is real while it is
       existing, because in quantum field theory the exchange of virtual
       particles generates  all the  forces of  nature.   We call such a
       fleeting or  ghostly particle  a virtual particle.  Of particular
       interest is  that enormous numbers of virtual photons continually
       appear and  disappear in the vacuum.  The vacuum is thus a fiery,
       seething cauldron  of incredible  EM energy, but the EM energy is
       essentially disintegrated.   At any rate, electromagnetically the
       quantum  mechanical   vacuum  to   first  order  consists  of  an
       incredible flux of virtual photons. [28]

       So to  be more  precise, in  the quantum mechanical vacuum you do
       not have observable charged mass, but you do have virtual charged
       mass.   So you can have a virtual E-field in the vacuum, which is
       just a  potential gradient  without the  presence  of  observable
       charged mass particles. [29]  Let's look a bit deeper:

                Detected EM Waves Are Electron Precession Waves

       Because of  the spin  of the  electron/particle,  that  potential
       gradient in  the vacuum __ that interacts, e.g., with an electron
       in a  detector probe wire __ is actually oriented longitudinally,
       at right  angles to  the present  notion of  a  transverse  wave.
       Let's see why:  The conduction electron in the wire is relatively
       constrained [30]  by all  the other conduction electrons ahead of
       it pushing  back when  it tries to accelerate.  Being constrained
       longitudinally  but  spinning,  it  acts  then  as  a  gyro,  and
       precesses  laterally   (from  the  direction  of  the  disturbing
       "force".   If a  vacuum potential gradient "virtual force" pushes
       on that  spinning electron  gyro in  a wire  probe, the  spinning
       electron must  move at  right angles  to  the  direction  of  the
       virtual force, because its movement is mostly precession.



                                      Page 7

       Conduction electrons  thus  don't  move  down  the  wire  at  the
       "disturbing  force's"  signal  velocity;  instead,  they  precess
       sideways, and  occasionally "slip"  forward down  the wire  a bit
       during their  precession.   They thus "drift" along down the wire
       at centimeters  per second  or so  __ not  even  approaching  the
       signal velocity (i.e., the velocity of the change in potential as
       the change  moves down  the wire).   The signal velocity down the
       wire is  only slightly  less than  the speed  of light in vacuum,
       which is  about 300,000,000  meters per  second.  [31][32]    The
       lateral or  transverse EM  forcefield waves  we  measure  in  our
       probes and  instruments __ and erroneously model in our theory as
       existing in the vacuum __ are actually electron translation waves
       in the  charged particle  system  (the  detector).    Since  that
       translation is  precession, the  measured EM transverse waves are
       actually electron  precession waves.  They are not at all what is
       in the  vacuum.  Instead, they are what is in the electron gas in
       the wires and circuits of our detectors and instruments.

                    EM Waves in the Vacuum Are Longitudinal

       Since the  interacting/disturbing virtual  E-field (the  massless
       potential gradient)  "force" in  the vacuum  must be  oriented at
       right  angles   to  the   detected  precession  movement  of  the
       electrons, then  the EM  waves in  vacuum are  actually "waves of
       potential gradients"  and are  longitudinal.    It  appears  that
       Nikola Tesla  was quite  correct on  this, you  see, and  all the
       modern textbooks are quite wrong. [33]

       So you  cannot have an observable E-field in the vacuum, contrary
       to what  classical EM  theory and  your physics  text  prescribe,
       because it  would require  the  presence  of  observable  charged
       particles, none of which are there.  It would in fact require the
       presence of  the mechanical  ether, a  notion that  was destroyed
       before the turn of the last century.  You do have virtual charged
       particles present  in  the  vacuum,  and  the  gradients  in  the
       vacuum/virtual domain are longitudinal, not transverse.

                    Why Maxwell Assumed Transverse EM Waves

       When Maxwell  wrote his theory, he used a mechanical model of the
       ether. [34]   In  that model, thin but observable mass "fluid" is
       assumed to  comprise and  fill the  vacuum.  Accordingly, Maxwell
       assumed observable  forcefields and  transverse EM waves to exist
       also, since  that is  what is measured in the electron gas in our
       probes and  detectors.   The electron had not been predicted yet,
       and electricity  was considered  to be  a thin material fluid, as
       was the  "luminiferous ether."   Decades  later, the  notion of a
       mechanical ether was destroyed experimentally, [35] but Maxwell's
       mechanical-ether-based  EM   model  __   as  by  then  long-since
       "interpreted" from  quaternions into  vectors, by  Heaviside  and
       Gibbs __  was not  changed accordingly.  With respect to the form
       of EM  waves in vacuum, the Heaviside/Gibbs vector interpretation
       model has been in error a long time __ just as was its Maxwellian
       quaternionic predecessor  __ and it's still in error, contrary to
       what they taught you in your textbooks and classes.

                   There Is a Mechanism for the Flow of Time

       Note in  passing that  the scattering interaction of the external

                                      Page 8

       EM with  the electron shells of atoms primarily creates the basic
       quantum changes that in turn create and control the nature of the
       macroscopic flow  of time.  In other words, a quantum consists of
       action, or  "energy times  time."  It carries not only a piece of
       energy, but  also a piece of time. [36][37][38]  Keep that firmly
       in mind for the following:

       A photon is freed EM energy.  Its thing is to travel at the speed
       of light.     Mass is  trapped EM  energy.   Its thing is to trap
       photons and  sit there  and hold  them as  a densely  packed mass
       potential.  (more on that later).

       In the  ubiquitous photon  interaction  with  mass  __  continual
       photon absorption  by matter  and photon  emission from it __ the
       energy portion  in the  absorbed quantum (photon; free EM energy)
       turns into  mass (trapped EM energy).  Simply divide the photon's
       energy by  c-squared to  get the  amount of extra resulting mass.
       However, absorption  of the  energy portion  of the photon leaves
       its "time  portion" or "time tail" attached to the "excited" mass
       that absorbed  the photon.   Thus  that (formerly)  mass __  that
       absorbed the  energy portion  of the  photon __ is now "masstime"
       and not mass.

       Note that  mass does  not exist  in time.   Masstime  does.  Each
       constituent particle  of the atom thus is alternately existing as
       mass, masstime,  mass, masstime,  etc.   Or in  other words, it's
       flipping between  atom, atom-time,  atom, atom-time, etc. states.
       Think deeply  about that.    Things  don't  "flow  through  time"
       continuously in  the manner  universally assumed.   To  the macro
       observer, of  course, the flipping is so rapid that he cannot see
       it.   So he sees the macro world as solid and continuous.  At the
       micro level,  physical reality  is being created and annihilated,
       quantum by quantum but at an incredible rate.

       Shortly after  absorbing the  photon, photon  emission from  that
       excited atom-time  occurs, and a bit of the atom-time's mass (the
       trapped EM  energy) is reconverted back to a new energy part of a
       photon (freed  EM  energy).    In  the  photon  freeing/formation
       process, this  freed "photon  energy part" absorbs/joins the time
       tail of  the atom-time  as part  of itself.  The emission of this
       photon "tears  off and  carries away  the  time  tail"  from  the
       mass/atom-time,  leaving   behind  mass/atom   again,   and   not
       (mass/atom)-time.    So  a  mass  is  continually  changing  into
       masstime, then  mass, then  masstime, then  mass, etc.   The mass
       "moves through time" in little jumps, so to speak, at a very high
       "jumping rate."

       The result  is that the "time dimension" connected to the mass of
       the observer  or instrument is not continuous, but discontinuous.
       It's rather like a switch being repeatedly thrown back and forth,
       between off and on states.  A mass's "passage through time" is in
       that vein.  The "time dimension" is continually being created and
       destroyed, for  each particle of mass in the observer/instrument,
       by photon  interaction.  By the creation portion, things exist in
       time, producing  causality and  a future  and a  past.    By  the
       destruction portion, the future and the past are disconnected and
       "lost."   That's why  you can look in a corner, and see the three
       length (spatial)  dimensions, but try as you will, you cannot see
       the time  dimension at right angles to them.  It doesn't exist as

                                      Page 9

       a continuous  dimension; otherwise,  you could  see into the past
       and into the future.

       Play around  with multiple  masses and multiple time flows a bit,
       and you'll  discover that  there are ways to "see into the future
       and the  past," but's that's way beyond the scope of this present
       discussion!   [Suffice it  to say that I know one physicist (PhD)
       who has extensively experimented with that, and another scientist
       who has  also experimented  with it,  but I  am not at liberty to
       discuss the results.].

                    External and Internal Electromagnetics

       But to  return.   To understand  scalar EM,  as we said, you must
       understand that there are actually two kinds of electromagnetics.
       One is __ so to speak __ only on the external "surface magnitude'
       of the  vacuum potential, and the other is in the interior of the
       vacuum potential.   The  exterior kind  is spatial in nature; the
       interior kind is hyperspatial in nature.

            (1) The  exterior kind  of  EM  is  caused  or  due  to  the
            potential magnitudes  and their  gradients, interacting with
            charged particles   (forcefields); that's the "normal" kind.
            In that  kind the  theoretical EM  model's focus  is on  the
            forcefields as  causes, with  the potentials themselves just
            regarded  as  mathematical  conveniences.    Certainly  that
            "normal" EM  does not  contain  any  sort  of  organized  EM
            structure inside,  and composing,  the scalar  EM potential.
            It just  models  the  scalar  potential  at  a  point  as  a
            magnitude,  and  the  vector  potential  at  a  point  as  a
            magnitude and  direction.   Notice it thus models only local
            action; it  does not model any sort of action at a distance.
            The  EM  action  is  considered  __  and  described  in  the
            classical EM  model __  as existing  at a point in space and
            time.  Further, the local spacetime itself is considered not
            to have any direct causative EM interaction there.  In other
            words, there are assumed to be no local vacuum engines __ no
            Whittaker activation of mass or the local vacuum.

            (2) There's  also an internal EM, normally completely inside
            the scalar  potential, which  exists as  "infolded" harmonic
            sets of EM antiparallel wave/antiwave pairs.  Whittaker 1903
            describes that  kind  of  EM.    This  internal  EM  was  in
            Maxwell's  original  quaternion  equations,  hidden  in  the
            scalar  component   resultant   that   remained   when   the
            directional components  of quaternions  interacted  to  form
            directional zero resultants.  The scalar component resultant
            of the interaction often still remained, and infolded inside
            itself (i.e.,  it  then  consisted  of)  scalar  and  vector
            functions  of   the  yet-present-and-interacting   component
            vectors. [39]

            Today that part of Maxwell's original theory just appears in
            classical  EM   Heaviside/Gibbs  theory  as  a  vector  zero
            resultant, which  is erroneously  discarded as  if it were a
            complete absence  of EM.   It is no such thing; it is merely
            the absence  of EM  translation of  charged particles.    It
            indeed is  a patterned  EM-induced gravitational  stress  in
            local spacetime,  and it is a little "vacuum engine" capable

                                      Page 10

            of working  directly on  the atomic nucleus.  If you want to
            know  what   all  the  fuss  about  the  difference  between
            Maxwell's 200-odd  quaternion equations  EM theory  [40] and
            the     Heaviside/Gibbs      four      vector      equations
            curtailment/subset, just  look at  the difference  between a
            zero  vector  result  and  a  quaternion  resultant,  in  an
            interaction where  the vector  resultant  is  zero  but  the
            scalar  component   of  the  quaternion  resultant  remains.
            Specifically, look mathematically at the internal functional
            nature of that remaining scalar resultant __ the part that's
            thrown away in the present theory.

            (3) Note  that the  internal EM is more than just a model of
            conditions at a point.  In addition to that, it prescribes a
            hyperspatial,  bidirectional  flow  of  EM  transverse  wave
            energy at  the point,  into and out of it, into it from afar
            and away  from it  back to  afar, on  an infinite  number of
            phase-locked frequencies.   In  other words, the internal EM
            energetically  connects   conditions   at   a   point   with
            essentially all  the other points in the universe.  And when
            we interfere  two such  scalar potentials,  we are  actually
            interfering both  of those  sets of  an infinite  number  of
            bidirectional EM  waves.   (See  Whittaker's  second  paper,
            1904). [41]   It  doesn't matter where the interference zone
            occurs; it  can be  a million  miles away,  or a  light-year
            away.    The  interference  accomplishes  "outfolding,"  and
            creates "normal" or "exterior" EM effects.  Specifically, it
            creates force fields and patterns of them __ both static and
            dynamic __  on charged  particle systems.   The  internal EM
            thus  prescribes  and  models  action  at  a  distance,  and
            incorporates the  "normal" exterior  EM as a special case of
            local scalar  interferometry.   Whittaker rigorously  proved
            this mathematically.

                   Zero-Translation-Vector-Resultant Systems

       You must  also do  some thinking about the scalar envelope nature
       of a  series of  finite, nonzero, interacting translation vectors
       which result  in a  zero-vector resultant  for translation.  They
       still form  an internally  active system, and their action cannot
       be ignored if one is to grasp the total physics of the situation.
       Not all  vector zeroes  are equal  __ it  is a serious fallacy of
       vector analysis to equate them, and also to equate all of them as
       "total absences." [42]  There's a great deal of difference in two
       identical tanks,  one of  which is  truly empty, and one which is
       filled  with   a  gas   under  enormous  pressure.    Neither  is
       translating, but  which one  would you  prefer to cut into with a
       cutting torch?   As  an example,  the  resultant  system  of  two
       equally forceful  elephants pushing  fiercely against  each other
       may not  translate, so  they will do no external translation work
       on an  external system.   But  they do  struggle fiercely against
       each other,  and put  a lot  of stress  in  there,  and  each  is
       constantly working  furiously. The  system isn't  doing  external
       translation work,  but it's  doing a  whale of  a lot of internal
       work, of  one elephant  on the  other.  [That, after all, is what
       internal stress  is __  it's a  condition of  internal work being
       continually performed  on the parts of a system, without external
       translation of the system.]

                 Internal EM Energy As Continual Internal Work

       Now two  matched fleas pushing together would be the same sort of
       "zero vector  translation" system  as the  system of  two matched
       elephants.  But if one thinks that all vector zero resultants are
       really equal, and really are the total absence of work and force,
       just try  standing between  the elephants  and then  between  the
       fleas, and  compare your  two  experiences.    I  think  you  can
       immediately see  a great  difference in  the two systems!  I also
       think you  can see that you really shouldn't neglect the internal
       energy trapped  in that  zero-translation-vector  system.    Many
       learned professors challenged with standing between two straining
       elephants, to  test their notion that the zero vector system is a
       "total absence  of force"  type of  zero  and  is  to  be  simply
       discarded, just  don't seem  to see the humor in the issue posed.
       Instead, they  are quite  apt to  become rather  furious  at  the
       suggestion  of   putting  the  issue  to  such  a  practical  and
       definitive test.   Ah,  me!   They really  will not  submit their
       pronouncements to  scientific verification  or  validation  by  a
       simple experiment!   [I  am particularly  fond of challenging the
       ones who  call me  all the  dirty names,  to test it with the two
       elephants.]

       But in a physical system, you might ask, how can the system, just
       sitting there doing nothing externally, be continually performing
       internal work,  which requires  continual  scattering  of  energy
       inside itself?   Simple.  All systems are open, driven systems __
       driven by  the VPF  of vacuum.   Such a system, in equilibrium in
       its  driving  flux  exchange  flows,  can  easily  be  constantly
       performing  internal   work.     Again,  it's   like  sticking  a
       paddlewheel in  a river,  without connecting any external load to
       the shaft.   The  system will  just sit  there and continually do
       internal work,  but it will not be doing any external translation
       work.   Nontranslating systems  are just  "idling" systems, so to
       speak, driven by the VPF exchange with the vacuum.  The vacuum is
       driving everything, everywhere, anyway.

                       What Electrical Charge Really Is

       Nowhere in  classical EM  does it tell you what electrical charge
       is or  what causes  it.   For that question, you will have to dig
       the answer  out of  quantum mechanics  and quantum  field theory.
       Briefly, the  electrical charge  of a  mass is really its violent
       exchange of virtual photons with the vacuum.  The charged mass of
       the particle  is continually  absorbing virtual  photons from the
       surrounding vacuum,  and re-emitting  them back  to  the  vacuum.
       Actually, the  magnitude of  the electrical  charge is  simply  a
       measure of  the volumetric  intensity of this virtual photon flux
       (VPF) exchange.   Also,  it is  fixed only for a fixed vacuum VPF
       intensity, in  which it  is embedded.   It's really discrete, not
       quantized.  If you change the local vacuum VPF flux intensity (by
       simply adding,  e.g., a positive or negative electrostatic scalar
       potential), you  create a  "locally excited  vacuum," a  "locally
       curved spacetime,"  and an  altered magnitude  of the charge on a
       fundamental   charged    particle   located   in   that   excited
       (potentialized) vacuum.   If  you want to get a Nobel prize, then
       perform some experiments along this line, to demonstrate that the
       electrical charge  of a  particle is discretized as a function of
       local vacuum VPF intensity, but it is not quantized, and write it

       up and publish it in a leading journal.  Of course if you do your
       experiments in an unexcited (i.e., normal ambient) vacuum, you'll
       get the  same answer  everyone  else  has  before  you.    Tesla,
       however, certainly held a very different view, and considered the
       electron as  having a  variable charge.  [43]  A lot of things in
       your EE book were simply assumed, back there at the beginning.

               What Unorthodox Researchers Mean By "Free Energy"

       Regarding your  present "free  energy is  impossible"  education,
       don't believe  a lot  of what you were told.  If they didn't even
       get the  definition of  energy correct __ and they didn't __ then
       you might  suspect they really are not too sure just what kind of
       energy is free for the taking and what kind is not.  Many of them
       certainly don't seem to recognize that there's absolutely no such
       thing as  a closed  system, anywhere in the universe.  Everything
       is open  to a virtual particle flux exchange with the vacuum, and
       every system  is driven  by that  flux and  its energy.   Indeed,
       every system  is just  a complex order in equilibrium in that VPF
       of vacuum,  with violent  input and  output continually.   All we
       mean by  "free energy  device" is a device that incorporates some
       sort of  "gating mechanism" to gate out a bit of that violent VPF
       energy circulation  in and  out of  the system.   We just wish to
       gate some  of the  vacuum energy  that runs  in to the nucleus __
       catch it  there before it runs back out to the vacuum, and "gate"
       it out  to the external circuit and the load before it is allowed
       to scatter  and run  back permanently  to the  vacuum.   It's  no
       different than  wishing to  put a  paddlewheel in a river, with a
       sluice-box arrangement to divert some of the river's water to the
       load (the  paddles) and  get shaft  power from the rushing water,
       before the  water is  allowed to spill off the paddles and return
       permanently back to the river.

            Local Energy Conservation Can Be Legitimately Violated

       "Conservation of  energy" ruthlessly  depends upon time symmetry;
       if    time     stress    is     made    asymmetrical    (as    in
       potentialization/curvature  of  the  local  vacuum/spacetime  and
       deliberately  altering   its  Whittaker  structure),  then  local
       conservation of  energy is  violated, and  the local  vacuum will
       serve as  a sink  or a  source, depending  upon  which  way  it's
       potentialized.   You can  easily violate  local  conservation  of
       energy by  curving local spacetime, if you understand Whittaker's
       two papers.  [44]  He already shows you that, in the potential at
       a point, you've got bidirectional EM wave flows of energy, in and
       out, from  all the  rest of  the vacuum  in the  universe.   That
       exchange of  the vacuum  is mostly  with the nucleus of the atom,
       for that's  where most of the mass potential is.  If you "gate" a
       little bit  of the  inflowing EM Whittaker wave energy out to the
       external circuits of a device, you will extract and use EM energy
       directly from the vacuum source.  As I showed in the Sweet vacuum
       triode write-up,  there's at  least one  major way  of doing just
       that sort of gating __ and the device proves it.

                   On Self-Powered Permanent Magnet Devices

       And they told you a magnet won't turn itself, didn't they?  Well,
       that's  not   always  true.    They  never  heard  of  a  kinetic
       (activated) magnet, which by definition traps-in a special vacuum

                                      Page 13

       engine function  to drive  it.  Floyd Sweet activates the magnets
       in his  vacuum triode  by a  special proprietary  process,  after
       which it can gate energy out of the vacuum into the external load
       circuit.     Until  the  nuclei  are  activated  to  function  as
       controlled vacuum  engines, the  device is  just an  inert, solid
       state pattern  of materials,  and quite  useless as  a generator.
       Also, check  the Einstein-de  Haas effect  for rigorous  proof of
       additional considerations in a magnet other than magnetic forces.
       [45]   In the  standard Einstein-de Haas experiment using a coil,
       substitute the  linear field region between two permanent magnets
       for the  coil's field  region, and you will see what I mean.  The
       Einstein-de Haas  effect is  only a  little bitty white crow, but
       it's quite sufficient to prove that not all crows are black.  But
       what if you could make the crow grow?

       Further, Howard Johnson goes after a self-powered permanent motor
       in a slightly different fashion.  Imagine a "rotary wheel" motor,
       where one  permanent bar  magnet is  used on the rotor and one on
       the stator.   Suppose the stator magnet has its north pole facing
       the rotor,  and the  rotor  magnet  has  its  south  pole  facing
       outward.   As the rotor magnet's south pole approaches the stator
       magnet's north pole, it is magnetically attracted and accelerates
       toward  it,  producing  forceful  torque  and  shaft  horsepower.
       During the  approach phase,  energy is  stored in the flywheel as
       mechanical energy.   Now  just as  the magnetic south pole on the
       rotor is  passing the  stator's  north  pole,  suppose  you  have
       cleverly produced or "activated" a little region of time-reversal
       on the  back side  of the  stator's "north"  pole.   In the time-
       reversed region, the north pole of the stator functions precisely
       as if it were a south pole, to an external observer (to the just-
       departing rotor  south pole,  for example.).   Consequently,  the
       rotor finds itself repelled on away from the stator, accelerating
       yet again  in the  same rotational  direction as  before.    This
       stores additional  energy in  the flywheel.   As can be seen, you
       are now  in an  "over-unity" condition,  and  you  can  power  an
       external load continually.

       In a  real-world device,  you may  not get total time-reversal at
       the backside  of the stator magnet's north pole, but only partial
       time reversal.   So  to the  departing south  pole of  the  rotor
       magnet, the  north pole backside of the stator magnet will appear
       to be  a much-weakened  north pole.   It  will still extract back
       some of the shaft energy previously stored in the flywheel during
       the approach phase, but not all of it.  Hence the device is still
       in an "over-unity" condition, and energy __ though not as much as
       before __  can be  continually extracted  from  it  to  power  an
       external load.

       In both  cases, using  time-reversal we  have created a region of
       local time  asymmetry, so  we can locally violate conservation of
       energy.   In this fashion, you can legitimately build a permanent
       magnet motor  that appears  to be  "self-powered."    The  entire
       secret is  how you  achieve the  time asymmetry  in  the  exactly
       needed place.   But  even with this over-unity condition, you are
       not violating  overall conservation  of the  universe as a whole.
       Remember, all  systems are  driven.   This self-powered permanent
       magnet motor  is actually  extracting and  gating energy from the
       local now-asymmetrical  flux exchange  of the atoms/nuclei of the
       magnet material  with the  vacuum.   It's still a special sort of

                                      Page 14

       paddlewheel in a special sort of river.  Time asymmetry, achieved
       by using  a time-reversing  material and  process, furnishes  the
       stream __ and standard techniques will furnish the "paddlewheel."

       Remember the principle: Conservation of energy ruthlessly depends
       upon  time   symmetry.    If  you're  going  to  locally  violate
       conservation of  energy, you  must establish  and utilize a local
       time asymmetry.   And  that can be done; at our present elemental
       level of  knowledge of vacuum engineering, it's quite tricky, and
       everything must  be precisely  so and  highly nonlinear __ but it
       can be  done.   And it's  really no  more mystical than putting a
       sluice-box arrangement in a flowing stream, diverting some of the
       water to a waterwheel, and extracting shaft horsepower.

       We emphasize,  however, that  you cannot,  cannot, cannot  make a
       self-powered permanent  magnet motor  with "ordinary" magnets and
       an "ordinary"  time-symmetrical vacuum,  no matter how strong the
       magnets, or  what exotic  form you twist them into.  You can make
       one with  activated magnets  and  an  extraordinary  asymmetrical
       vacuum, which have locked-in time asymmetry regions.
