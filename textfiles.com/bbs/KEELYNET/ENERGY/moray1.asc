         This article  was in Fate Magazine, in September of 1956.  It is
    just one of the stories that was  dug  up  from  the Vangard Sciences
    archives.   It entails some of the work that Mr. Thomas  Henry  Moray
    was doing in  attempting  to  tap into cosmic energy.   Mr. Moray was
    developing an electric motor which  would  be  able  to  run off this
    cosmic energy.  Some  of the devices he developed apparently  worked,
    using silver and  copper  bars.   This is very similar to some of the
    work John Keely had done with his Compound Disintegrator.

         This electromagnetic zero-point  energy  is  also  known  as the
    Casimir effect, named after researcher Milonni.   The  Casimir effect
    refers to an  attractive  quantum  force between closely-spaced metal
    plates.

                                ALCHEMIST 1956

                              By Gaston Burridge

        A salt Lake City man claims discovery of a new form of energy
                with which he performs metallurgical miracles.

         Legend, if  not  history,  has  it  that the alchemists  of  old
    searched for two   things;  how  to  make  gold  from  baser  metals,
    especially lead, and how to produce an elixir of life.

         Some persons believe the alchemists were not searching for a new
    formula for making  gold, but rather  looking  for  information  they
    believed was once known, then lost.

         Gold has  intrigued  the  minds of men since history  was  first
    recorded. In several  lands  gold  was called the "sun metal". It was
    used in worship and to decorate holy places.

         Modern scientists are not adverse  to  the  idea  that  gold and
    other metals can be transmuted from materials not containing  gold as
    we recognize it.

                                    Page 1




         In fact,  scientists  already  have  transmuted  gold!   It is a
    terribly expensive process and the amount of gold is tiny, but it has
    been done.  In addition, this man-made  gold  is radioactive and thus
    unstable.  That is, it does not remain as made for very long. Rather,
    it changes into something else or just disappears.

         This brings us to Thomas Henry Moray, of Salt  Lake  City, Utah,
    who claims to  have made gold which is stable and long lasting enough
    to be assayed by the ordinary methods  used to determine the presence
    of gold.  He  says  his  process  uses no cyclotron  or  other  atom-
    smashing device.

         Not only does Moray say he has transmuted gold, but he writes me
    that he has produced, or perhaps "treated" is a better word, ordinary
    lead, "Pb", in  such  a  way that it will not melt under 2000 degrees
    Fahrenheit!

         Common lead  melts  at about  625  degrees  Fahrenheit.    Moray
    writes, "I mean  2000  degrees,  not 2000 degrees Fahrenheit!."   So,
    there is no question of a misplaced zero here!

         Going into  this  matter of metallurgy still further, Moray says
    he has treated copper, "Cu", so it  does  not melt under 3000 degrees
    F.  Ordinarily copper melts at about 1980 degrees F.

         Moray also wrote me he has produced an alloy which will not melt
    under 12,000 degrees  F.!   This  figure has been checked.  He  says,
    "Hundreds of persons have seen and tested these metals."

         One ounce  of  lead  treated  by  Moray's process, and afterward
    assayed by the Boaz Mine Laboratory,  Norris,  Mont., showed 35 cents
    in gold.   Five ounces of soil, which assayed no gold  at  all before
    treatment, after Moray's  treatment, assayed gold content at the rate
    of $122.50 per ton.

         Another interesting test was  made  by  the  Union Assay Office,
    Salt Lake City  on about 50 c.c. of artesian water  which  showed  no
    trace of gold  before  treatment.   After treatment it assayed at the
    per ton rate of $10.50 in gold and $2.63 in silver!

         It should be understood these  experiments  were  not  done on a
    commercial basis, but  as  a laboratory experiment.    It  should  be
    remembered too, these  metals  did  not "vanish" after the experiment
    was concluded but remained stable  at  least  long  enough  to be run
    through standard assaying processes.

         Mr. Moray  has  experimented  along  lines  of   increasing  the
    radioactivity of certain already radioactive minerals by his process.

         He says  he has increased the activity of carnotite, uranium and
    other radioactive substances, including  a  combination of copper and
    lead!

         Immediately, one  is  anxious to know how such wonderful  things
    are accomplished.   Therein,  lies  a set of secrets known completely
    only to T. H. Moray.

         It would appear they may involve  a whole new concept of things.
    Whether these concepts coincide with present scientific  concepts  of
    atomic structure I do not know.

         T. H.  Moray  is  an electrical engineer, born and brought up in
    Salt Lake City,  Utah.    Who's  Who   in   Engineering  carries  the
    following information concerning him.

             "Born August 28, 1892, Educated, public schools,  Salt  Lake
              City.  Graduated  from  The  Latter  Day  Saint's  Business
              College there: completed  an  Electrical Engineering course
              with International Correspondence School:  Took  his  E. E.
              degree, University of Upsala.

             "Moray has held the following positions: Electrical Engineer
              and designer,  Utah  Power  &  Light  Co.,  and the Phoenix
              Construction Co.;  Assistant   Chief   Engineer,   Arastard
              Construction &   Engineering   Co.;   Division   Electrical
              Engineer, Mountain  States Telephone & Telegraph Co. He was
              also a consulting engineer in private practice."

             "Moray has written articles for several publications dealing
              with electrical engineering  matters.    For many years now
              he has  devoted much time to experimenting  and  developing
              what he chooses to call "the field of radiant energy".

         It is  through  the  application of this "radiant energy", then,
    that Mr. Moray  stakes  his  claim   for   his   many   metallurgical
    accomplishments.   Within this realm lie his secrets.   Perhaps, like
    Sir Issac Newton, Moray is ahead of his time.

         Just what is radiant energy?  Where does it come  from?  How may
    it be used  by  man?   These  and  a  host of other questions must be
    answered.

         Unfortunately much of this information  is  held  secret  by Mr.
    Moray.  Even if it were available it would require a  large volume to
    cover it.

         However, we  can  make  a  beginning.   Mr. Moray believes there
    exists a band of vibrations or waves  "beyond the light rays".  These
    vibrations come in  surges or groups like ocean waves  -  a  powerful
    first surge, followed  by  other  less  powerful and graduated surges
    which finally fade to nothing, only to begin over again immediately.

         I have understood, not from Moray, that he first became aware of
    these strange surges early in his career,  as he sat through the long
    nights, his car  headlights  "glued"  to  a silent set  of  telephone
    lines.

         Here he  first  beard  the  regular  but oscillatory "cadence of
    sounds" and wondered  what produced  them.    During  his  search  he
    discovered this force he chooses to call "radiant energy."

         Moray has  come to believe this force pervades  all  space.   He
    believes one may  tap it on the Moon, on Pluto, at the farthest point
    of the Milky Way, or anywhere between, as well as on Earth.

         While Mr.   Moray  does  not   believe   in  "perpetual  motion,
    perpetual light or  perpetual  power", he does think  the  supply  of
    radiant energy is ample for all mankind's power needs indefinitely.

         One of  Moray's  adherents  wrote  me,  "I think Moray's radiant
    energy is the  greatest invention  of  our  time.  Atomic  energy  is
    `peanuts' by comparison."
                                    Page 3




         One may  think  as  he  pleases,  of course, but it seems such a
    statement is a bit over-optimistic at this time.  Nothing approaching
    so vast an accomplishment has been demonstrated thus far.

         However, Nikola Tesla never made  known  all  the results of his
    Colorado experiments and it is quite possible he learned something of
    a potential force similar to radiant energy but thought the world not
    ready for it.  It is known that Moray is a close student  of  Tesla's
    work.

         On the  other  hand,  Moray gradually has perfected his device's
    output from a capacity to light one  small incandescent light bulb to
    a present capacity  claimed  to  be  50  kilowatts.  Fifty  kilowatts
    represents bout 67 horsepower and, certainly, 67 horsepower is not to
    be disregarded.   Many  small  factories  do  not  use  as much as 67
    horsepower.

         According to Moray, one of his  present  units  can be built for
    about $800.   Mass production methods might cut this  price  in half.
    Under these circumstances,  a  unit  in  a  home  would bring about a
    substantial saving in power bills over several years time.

         As many   as   100  persons  have   witnessed   radiant   energy
    demonstrations.   Radiant energy,  as  it  emerges   from  the  Moray
    apparatus, may be  considered  a  form  of  electricity.    It  is an
    alternating current, but  an  alternating   current   of   very  high
    frequency or cyclage.

         This current will light ordinary incandescent light  bulbs.  The
    light which comes  from these bulbs is called "pure white on the blue
    side, not on the yellow side as light  given  off when the same bulbs
    are lighted with commercial currents."

         This light  possesses  high actinic qualities,  which  means  it
    affects photographic films quickly and powerfully.  Photographers who
    have exposed films  in this light have found they are forced to "stop
    way down" to prevent over exposure.

         If a photograph of a single bulb  lighted with radiant energy is
    taken the print shows a large, dark ring, perpendicular  to  the base
    of the bulb.    This  ring  looks  like a circle of translucent black
    fog.  It seems the light somehow  reflects  itself  on  the  air,  or
    projects a shadow of itself there.

         Some persons who have seen radiant energy power  lights  say the
    bulbs look as  if  they  were filled entirely with white light, as if
    the gas itself which fill the bulbs  were  fully incandescent.  Moray
    believes this to be true.

         Radiant energy   will  heat  electric  flat  irons   and   other
    electrical heating devices.    It  is  claimed heating capacities are
    reached much more quickly with radiant  energy  than  with commercial
    currents, and are considerably hotter than when powered with ordinary
    electric energy.

         The high  frequency of radiant energy is responsible  for  this.
    Moray SAYS HE HAS LEARNED THE EXACT FREQUENCY OF RADIANT ENERGY
    but he will  not  disclose  it.   Further,  he  says  voltmeters  and
    ammeters used to measure commercial  alternating  currents  will  not
    measure radiant energy.

                                    Page 4




         Electric motors wound to turn on commercial electricity will not
    operate on radiant  energy.    He  says,  "Motors wound to accept the
    frequency of radiant energy will operate."

                  (Morays' energy machine would only operate
                       RESISTIVE DEVICES......VANGARD)

         However, I  learned  elsewhere,  that  while  such  motors  will
    operate they are  not  as  efficient  as motors running  on  ordinary
    commercial currents.   Moray  says when his motors are running in the
    dark they glow with a violet aura.   His motors run cold!

         The speeds  of  the  radiant energy  motors,  as  reported,  are
    fantastic.   Moray wrote  me  they  turn  over  better   than  36,000
    revolutions per minute, more than 600 per second!

         When I asked where he gets bearings to withstand such phenomenal
    speeds, Moray replied  that he makes them.   Thus I learned about his
    metallurgical work.

         What sort  of an apparatus is  Moray's  Radiant  Energy  Device?
    Briefly, it would  appear to be similar to a radio receiving  set  of
    power proportions.

         It is  composed  of  two  coils  of  wire, or inductancies.   It
    contains several condensers, or capacitors, of different sizes.

         There is  a  detector  tube,   or   electronic  valve,  and  two
    oscillator tubes.  Added to this is a "bar of silver  and  a  bar  of
    copper", a starting  device,  and a step down electrical transformer,
    reported to be 1000-to-1, primary to secondary.

         All of this is enclosed in a box  measuring about 30 inches long
    by 16 inches  wide  by  16 inches high.  It weighs about  50  pounds.
    There are no   moving  parts.  Moray  says  there  are  no  dangerous
    radiations surrounding the box when it is in operation.

         Many persons have looked inside  the  box.    Several  have made
    more than a  cursory  examination of its contents -  except  for  the
    detector tube!

         The inductances  are about eight and 10 inches in diameter. They
    are composed of several layers of wire.   The diameter of the wire is
    much smaller than necessary to carry  anything  like  50 kilowatts of
    ordinary commercial electricity.

         Probably, there is a direct relationship between the size of the
    wire and the number of turns of it on each coil.  Further,  it can be
    assumed the distance  separating  the two coils is important, as well
    as the direction in which the coils are wound.

         Moray is silent as to the materials  used  in  his capacitors or
    condensers.   Neither does he tell their capacities.    They  vary in
    size but this is not indicative of capacity!

         If one  part  of  the apparatus is more important than another I
    would conclude it is the tubes or  valves.    Moray will not say much
    about these.   He  admits they do not contain an electrically  heated
    filament whose radiations  provide  the means of carrying currents to
    different parts of the tube and which produce the valve action.

                                    Page 5




         How, then,  is this valve action produced?   Moray does not say.
    I have learned,  from  other  sources,   of   Moray's   purchase   of
    radioactive materials.

         I have  been  informed  by  one  source  that Moray  uses  these
    radioactivities as the "carrying-currents" within his tubes.  Exactly
    what the radioactive materials may be, I have not learned as yet.

         Some say  it  is  a uranium compound; others deny this.  What is
    more, we do not know whether the detector  tube  and  the oscillators
    use the same materials.

         Being cold tubes, it can be assumed they are not  vacuum  tubes.
    However, Moray does  have  vacuum  pumps in his laboratory. The tubes
    may be filled with gas.  But if they are filled with a gas, what gas?

         These tubes, especially the  detector,  seem  to  be the weakest
    links in the chain of parts in the Moray system.  By  far the greater
    number of times  the  demonstration  apparatus has stopped because of
    troubles, it appeared the trouble lay in the detector tube.

         Moray does  not  allow  anyone   to  see  the  detector  tube  -
    apparently the big secret of the device lies there!

         At the same time, the least understood of the device's mysteries
    is the function of the bar of silver and the bar of  copper  set side
    by side.

         Are they "true" copper and silver?  Or are they alloys -possibly
    treated with the  very radiant energy they may help to produce?  Have
    they been transmuted in some way?   Are they only decoys?  Are they a
    special type of   air   condenser?    Are   their  lengths,   widths,
    thicknesses, as well  as  their  distance  apart, important?   All of
    these questions, and many, many more,  flood  into  one's  mind - and
    remain unanswered!

         Early in his experiments Mr. Moray used both an  antenna  and  a
    ground connection.   He  no longer uses either.   This eliminates the
    possibility that he taps either current  from  power  lines  or  from
    radio transmitters.

         The longest  known continuous run of the apparatus  has  been  a
    little over 57  hours.   It has been run nearly three times that long
    with short shutdowns for inspection of different parts.

         Such long test runs pretty well  spike  any  idea that Moray has
    batteries in the box. If he does have batteries in  the  box  he  has
    something new in batteries!

         Even if  Moray's  device were a commercial item today - which it
    most certainly is not - it would  be  years  before  our  present-day
    electrical power would become obsolete.

         Perhaps it  might  never become outmoded. It is  quite  possible
    many uses made  of  commercial  electricity  could not be supplied by
    radiant energy.

         We are quite sure radiant energy  does  not  transmit  well even
    over short distances.   It seems quite possible that  definite limits
    exist on the size of radiant energy units.  There is some question as

                                    Page 6




    to how many  such  units  could  be  operated  within any given area.
    Further, what effect would radiant energy devices have upon radio and
    television reception and transmission?

         It appears long research will be necessary before radiant energy
    can be more than an "interesting matter  to  ponder!"  And within our
    lifetimes other forms of power generators may be commercialized.

         Already we begin to hear of electricity so cheap  it will not be
    metered!  But little  either comes or goes in a day.  As always, time
    is both our enemy and our friend.
