                                  NEWMAN'S THEORY

                               By Roger Hastings PhD
                      Transcribed By George W. Dahlberg P.E.

       I  do not intend to recapitulate the theory presented in Newman's
       book,  but  rather  to briefly provide my interpretation  of  his
       ideas. Newman began studying electricity and magnetism in the mid
       1960's.  He  has a mechanical background,  and was looking for  a
       mechanical  description of electromagnetic fields.  That  is,  he
       assumed that there must be a mechanical interaction between,  for
       example, two magnets. He could not find such a description in any
       book,  and  decided  that  he  would  have  to  provide  his  own
       explanation.  He  came to the conclusion that if  electromagnetic
       fields  consisted of tiny spinning particles moving at the  speed
       of  light  along  the field lines,  then  he  could  explain  all
       standard  electromagnetic  phenomena through the  interaction  of
       spinning particles.  Since the spinning particles interact in the
       same  way  as  gyroscopes,  he called  the  particles  gyroscopic
       particles.  In  my opinion,  such spinning particles do provide a
       qualitative  description of electromagnetic  phenomena,  and  his
       model  is  useful in understanding complex electrical  situations
       (note  that  without a pictoral model one must rely  solely  upon
       mathematical equations which can become extremely complex).

       Given that electromagnetic fields consist of matter in motion, or
       kenetic  energy,  Joe decided that it should be possible  to  tap
       this  kinetic energy.  He likes to say "How long did man sit next
       to  a stream before he invented the paddle wheel?".  Joe built  a
       variety  of  unusual  devices  to  tap  the  kinetic  energy   in
       electromagnetic  fields  before he arrived at his  present  motor
       design.  He likes to point out that both Maxwell and Faraday, the
       pioneers of electromagnitism,  believed that the fields consisted
       of  matter  in motion.  This is stated in no uncertain  terms  in
       Maxwell's book "A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field".
       In  fact,  Maxwell  used a dynamical model to derive  his  famous
       equations.  This  fact has all but been lost in current books  on
       electromagnetic   theory.   The  quantity  which  Maxwell  called
       "electromagnetic  momentum"  is  now refered to  as  the  "vector
       potential".

       Going  further,  Joe  realized  that when  a  magnetic  field  is

                                      Page 1





       created, its gyroscopic particles must come from the atoms of the
       materials  which  created  the field.  Thus he decided  that  all
       matter  must  consist  of  the  same  gyroscopic  particles.  For
       example,  when  a voltage is applied to a wire,  Newman  pictures
       gyroscopic  particles  (which  I will call  gyrotons  for  short)
       moving down the wire at the speed of light.  These gyrotons  line
       up the electrons in the wire. The electrons themselves consist of
       a  swirling  mass of gyrotrons,  and their matter fields  combine
       when lined up to form the magnetic lines of force circulating
       around  the wire.  In this process,  the wire has literally  lost
       some of its mass to the magnetic field, and this is accounted for
       by Einstein's equation of energy equals mass times the square  of
       the  speed of light.  According to Einstein,  every conversion of
       energy involves a corresponding conversion of  matter.  According
       to  Newman,  this may be interpreted as an exchange of gyrotrons.
       For example,  if two atoms combine to give off light,  the  atoms
       would  weight  slightly  less  after the  reaction  than  before.
       According to Newman,  the atoms have combined and given off  some
       of their gyrotrons in the form of light. Thus Einstein's equation
       is interpreted as a matter of counting gyrotrons. These particles
       cannot  be  created  or destroyed in Newman's  theory,  and  they
       always move at the speed of light.

       My  interpretation of Newman's original idea for his motor is  as
       follows.  As  a  thought  experiment,  suppose one  made  a  coil
       consisting  of 186,000 miles of wire.  An electrical field  would
       require  one  second  to travel the length of  the  wire,  or  in
       Newman's language, it would take one second for gyrotons inserted
       at one end of the wire to reach the other end.  Now suppose  that
       the  polarity of the applied voltage was switched before the  one
       second has elapsed, and this polarity switching was repeated with
       a  period less than one second.  Gyrotons would become trapped in
       the wire,  as their number increased,  so would the alignment  of
       electrons  and  the  number  of gyrotons in  the  magnetic  field
       increase. The intensified magnetic field could be used to do work
       on an external magnet,  while the input current to the coil would
       be small or non-existant.  Newman's motors contain up to 55 miles
       of  wire,  and  the  voltage is rapidly switched  as  the  magnet
       rotates.  He elaborates upon his theory in his book,  and uses it
       to interpret a variety of physical phenomena.

       RECENT DATA ON THE NEWMAN MOTOR

       In  May  of  1985 Joe Newman demonstrated his most  recent  motor
       prototype  in Washington,  D.C..  The motor consisted of a  large
       coil wound as a solenoid, with a large magnet rotating within the
       bore  of the solenoid.  Power was supplied by a bank of six  volt
       lantern batteries.  The battery voltage was switched to the  coil
       through a commutator mounted on the shaft of the rotating magnet.
       The  commutator  switched the polarity of the voltage across  the
       coil  each half cycle to keep a positive torque on  the  rotating
       magnet.  In  addition,  the commutator was designed to break  and
       remake  the  voltage contact about 30 times per cycle.  Thus  the
       voltage to the coil was pulsed.  The speed of the magnet rotation
       was  adjusted by covering up portions of the commutator  so  that
       pulsed voltage was applied for a fraction of a cycle.  Two speeds
       were  demonstrated:  12 R.P.M.  for which 12 pulses occured  each
       revolution;  and  120 rpm for which all commutator segments  were
       firing.  The  slower speed was used to provide clear oscilloscope

                                      Page 2





       pictures  of currents and voltages.  The fast speed was  used  to
       demonstrate  the  potential power of the  motor.  Energy  outputs
       consisted  of  incandescent bulbs in series with  the  batteries,
       flourescent  tubes across the coil,  and a fan powered by a  belt
       attached to the shaft of the rotor. Revelent ,otor parameters are
       given below:

       Coil weight    :  9000 lbs.
       Coil length    :  55 miles of copper wire
       Coil Inductance:  1,100 Henries measured by observing the current
                         rise time when a D.C. voltage was applied.
       Coil resistance:  770 Ohms
       Coil Height    :  about 4 ft.
       Coil Diameter  :  slightly over 4 ft. I.D.

       Magnet weight  :  700 lbs.
       Magnet Radius  :  2 feet
       Magnet geometry: cylinder rotating about its perpendicular axis
       Magnet  Moment of Inertia:  40 kg-sq.m.  (M.K.S.) computed as one
                                   third mass times radius squared

       Battery Voltage:  590 volts under load
       Battery Type   :  Six volt Ray-O-Vac lantern batteries  connected
                         in series

       A  brief description of the measurements taken and distributed at
       the press conference follows.  When the motor was rotating at  12
       rpm,  the average D.C. input current from the batteries was about
       2  milli-amps,  and the average battery input was then 1.2 watts.
       The  back  current  (flowing against  the  direction  of  battery
       current) was about -55 milli-amps,  for an average charging power
       of  -32  watts.  The  forward and reverse  current  were  clearly
       observable  on  the  oscilloscope.  It was noted  that  when  the
       reverse  current  flowed,  the  battery voltage  rose  above  its
       ambient  value,  varifying that the batteries were charging.  The
       magnitude  of the charging current was verified by heating  water
       with  a resistor connected in series with the  batteries.  A  net
       charging  power  was the primary evidence used to show  that  the
       motor was generating energy internally,  however output power was
       also  observed.  The 55 m-amp current flowing in the 770 ohm coil
       generates  2.3  watts of heat,  which is in excess of  the  input
       power. In addition, the lights were blinking brightly as the coil
       was switched.

       The  back  current from the coil switched from zero  to  negative
       several amps in about 1 milli-second, and then decayed to zero in
       about 0.1 second.  Given the coil inductance of 1100 henries, the
       switching  voltages were several million  volts.  Curiously,  the
       back  current  did  not switch on smoothly,  but increased  in  a
       staircase.   Each  step  in  the  staircase  corresponded  to  an
       extremely  fast switching of current,  with each increase in  the
       current  larger  than the previous increase.  The  width  of  the
       stairs was about 100 micro-seconds,  which for reference is about
       one third of the travel time of light through the 55 mile coil.

       Mechanical  losses  in the rotor were measured  as  follows:  The
       rotor  was  spun  up by hand with the  coil  open  circuited.  An
       inductive  pick-up  loop  was  attached to a  chart  recorder  to
       measure the rate of decay of the rotor.  The energy stored in the

                                      Page 3





       rotor  (one  half the moment of inertia times the square  of  the
       angular velocity) was plotted as a function of time. The slope of
       this curve was measured at various times and gave the power  loss
       in  the rotor as a function of rotor speed.  The result of  these
       measurements is given in the following table:

            Rotor Speed       Power Dissipation    Power/(Speed Squared)
            radian/sec             watts           watts/(rad/sec)^2
                 4.0                6.3             0.39
                 3.7                5.8             0.42
                 3.3                5.0             0.46
                 3.0                3.5             0.39
                 2.1                2.0             0.45
                 1.7                1.2             0.42
                 1.2                0.7             0.47

       The data is consistant with power loss proportional to the square
       of the angular speed,  as would be expected at low  speeds.  When
       the  rotor moves fast enough so that air resistance is important,
       the  losses  would begin to increase as the cube of  the  angular
       speed.  Using power = 0.43 times the square of the angular  speed
       will  give  a lower bound on mechanical power dissipation at  all
       speeds.  When the rotor is moving at 12 rpm,  or 1.3 rad/sec, the
       mechanical loss is 0.7 watts.

       When the rotor was sped up to 120 rpm by allowing the  commutator
       to  fire on all segments,  the results were quite  dramatic.  The
       lights  were  blinking  rapidly and brightly,  and  the  fan  was
       turning rapidly. The back current spikes were about ten amps, and
       still  increased  in a staircase,  with the width of  the  stairs
       still about 100 micro-seconds. Accurate measurements of the input
       current  were  not obtained at that time,  however I will  report
       measurements communicated to me by Mr. Newman. At a rotation rate
       of  200 rpm (corresponding to mechanical losses of at  least  190
       watts),  the  input power was about 6 watts.  The back current in
       this  test was about 0.5 amps,  corresponding to heating  in  the
       coil of 190 watts.  As a final point of interest, note that the Q
       of  his  coil  at  200  rpm is about  30.  If  his  battery  plus
       commutator  is  considered as an  A.C.  power  source,  then  the
       impedance of the coil at 200 rpm is 23,000 henries, and the power
       factor is 0.03.  In this light,  the predicted input power at 700
       volts is less than one watt!

       MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTION OF NEWMAN'S MOTOR

       Since  I am preparing this document on my home computer,  it will
       be  convenient to use the Basic computer language to  write  down
       formulas.  The  notation is * for multiply,  / for divide,  ^ for
       raising  to  a  power,  and  I  will  use  -dot  to  represent  a
       derivative.  Newton's  second law of motion applied  to  Newman's
       rotor yields the following equation:

            MI*TH-dot-dot + G*TH-dot = K*I*SIN(TH)      (1)

       where     MI = rotor moment of inertia
                 TH = rotor angular position (radians)
                  G = rotor decay constant
                  K = torque coupling constant
                  I = coil current

                                      Page 4





       In  general the constant G may depend upon rotor speed,  as  when
       air resistance becomes important. The term on the right hand side
       of the equation represents the torque delivered to the rotor when
       current  flows  through the coil.  A constant friction  term  was
       found through measurement to be small compared to the TH-dot term
       at  reasonable speeds,  but can be included in the "constant"  G.
       The equation for the current in the coil is given by:

            L*I-dot + R*I = V(TH) - K*(TH-dot)*SIN(TH)      (2)

       where          L = coil inductance
                      I = coil current
                      R = coil resistance
                      V(TH) = voltage applied to coil by the
                              commutator which is a function
                              of the angle TH
                      K = rotor induction constant

       In   general,   the  resistance  R  is  a  function  of  voltage,
       particularly during commutator switching when the air  resistance
       breaks  down  creating a spark.  Note that the constant K is  the
       same  in  equations  (1) and (2).  This  is  required  by  energy
       conservation    as   discussed   below.    To   examine    energy
       considerations, multiply Equation (1) by TH-dot, and Equation (2)
       by I.  Note that the last term in each equation is then identical
       if  the K's are the same.  Eliminating the last term between  the
       two equations yields the instantaneous conservation law:

       I*V=R*I^2 + G*(TH-dot)^2 + .5*L*(I^2)-dot =.5*MI*((TH-dot)^2)-dot

       If  this equation is averaged over one cycle of the  rotor,  then
       the  last  two  terms  vanish when steady  state  conditions  are
       reached (i.e.  when the current and speed repeat their values  at
       angular  positions which are separated by 360 degrees).  Denoting
       averages by < >, the above equation becomes:

            <IV> = <R*I^2> + <G*(TH-dot)^2>         (3)

       This result is entirely general,  independent of any  dependences
       of  R and G on other quantities.  The term on the left represents
       the  input  power.  The  first term on the  right  is  the  power
       dissipated  in  the  coil,  and  the second  term  is  the  power
       delivered  to  the  rotor.   The  efficiency,  defined  as  power
       delivered to the rotor divided by input power is thus always less
       than one by Equation (3). This result does require, however, that
       the  constants K in equation (1) and equation (2) are  identical.
       If  the constant K in equation (2) is smaller than the constant K
       appearing  in  equation (1),  then it may be  varified  that  the
       efficiency can mathmatecally be larger than unity.

       What do the constants,  K,  mean?  In the first equation, we have
       the torque delivered to the magnet,  while in the second equation
       we  have  the back inductance or reaction of the magnet upon  the
       coil.  The equality of the constants is an expression of Newton's
       third  law.  How  could the constants be  unequal?  Consider  the
       sequence  of  events  which  occur  during  the  firing  of   the
       commutator.  First the contact breaks,  and the magnetic field in
       the  coil  collapses,  creating a huge forward spike  of  current
       through  the  coil and battery.  This current spike  provides  an

                                      Page 5





       impulsive  torque to the rotor.  The rotor accelerates,  and  the
       acceleration  produces a changing magnetic field which propagates
       through  the  coil,  creating  the back  emf.  Suppose  that  the
       commutator  contacts  have separated sufficiently when  the  last
       event  occurs  to prevent the back current from  flowing  to  the
       battery.  Then  the back reaction is effectively smaller than the
       forward  impulsive torque on the rotor.  This suggestion  invokes
       the finite propagation time of the electromagnetic fields,  which
       has not been included in Equations (1) and (2).

       A  continued  mathmatical  modeling of the  Newman  motor  should
       include the effects of finite propagation time,  particularly  in
       his extraordinary long coil of wire.  I have solved Equations (1)
       and  (2) numerically,  and note that the solutions require  finer
       and  finer step size as the inductance,  moment of  inertia,  and
       magnet  strength  are increased to large  values.  The  solutions
       break  down such that the motor "takes off" in the computer,  and
       this  may  indicate instabilities,  which could  be  mediated  in
       practise by external pertubations.  I am confident that Maxwell's
       equations  ,  with  the proper electro-mechanical  coupling,  can
       provide  an explanation to the phenomena observed in  the  Newman
       device.  The  electro-mechanical coupling may be embedded in  the
       Maxwell  equations if a unified picture (such as Newman's picture
       of gyroscopic particles) is adopted.
