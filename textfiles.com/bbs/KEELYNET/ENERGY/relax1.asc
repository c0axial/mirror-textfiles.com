       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       This file is  a  collection  of  observations and conclusions that I
       have made and come to after reading  most of the files on the energy
       directory and Beardon's last collection of free energy papers.

       Beardon says that you have to charge a collector then  discharge it.
       The trick however  is  to  charge  the collector without letting any
       current flow from the electron source, the negative terminal, to the
       sink, the positive terminal.

       Because of the speed of the electrons  traveling  in  a copper wire,
       this is almost an impossibility. He claims that you  have  to  use a
       conductor that has  a  relaxation  time  that  is  longer  than  the
       relaxation time of copper. His suggestion  is that you have to use a
       xxx conductor.

       Here in lies the problem and I believe at the same  time the answer.
       Consider for a  minute the speed of electrons in a copper conductor.
       Right, about 1 nanosecond per foot.  So,  if we run the math on this
       basic number we find the following:

                         Length       Time
                           1 ft       1 ns
                          10 ft      10 ns
                         100 ft     100 ns
                       1,000 ft       1 us
                       2,000 ft       2 us
                       5,000 ft       5 us
                      10,000 ft      10 us
                      50,000 ft      50 us

       What we see  here  is  that we can, with very long  runs  of  copper
       conductor, increase the  time  delay  that it will take the electron
       flow to reach the other end. With  a spool of thin copper conductor,
       say 20 or 30 gage, the type used for wire wrapping,  we  can  fairly
       easily come up with a device where we can turn on the current from a
       battery and turn  it  off  again  without  any  current ever flowing
       through the circuit.

       For example, using the above numbers,  one  could assemble a circuit
       (figure 1) that can switch the collector (the spool  of  wire)  into
       the battery circuit  for about 40uS then switch it to a resistive

                                      Page 1





       load for a  time  period  longer  than  40uS.  We need a longer time
       period to dischare the collector than  we needed to charge it. Using
       Beardon's logic that you can have as many collectors  as  you desire
       running off of the same source, we could have two or more collectors
       that are alternately switched between the source and the load.

       When you look at this, it seems obvious as hell. The problem Beardon
       points out is  a  problem  only  because  of  the  switching  speeds
       associated with relatively short  conductors.  A  coil of copper (of
       any gage thickness)  that  is  say a hundred feet long,  will  allow
       electrons to flow   from  the  negative  terminal  to  the  positive
       terminal in about 100 nanoseconds.

       Most of us do not have the facilities  or the resources to construct
       a switching device that can switch a coil quite that  fast.  Most of
       us however could,   using   basic   Radio   Shack   parts,  build  a
       multivibrator (a single   chip)    that   uses   optically   coupled
       transistors that could switch a 50,000 ft coil to and  from a source
       and load at say a 40 microsecond rate.

       There may be a fatal flaw to this logic but I don't think so. Having
       spent 25 years  in  the  computer business with 13 recent years as a
       consultant and now the director of engineering, I have observed that
       most successful solutions are actually  quite  simple. When the dust
       from our most  recent  reorganization  settles,  I'm   going  to  be
       completing the switch  and  buying  a  few  large rolls of wire wrap
       wire.

               a & b are optical coupled transistors. Typically,
                     these are low power devices but should be able

                     to support a couple of hundred milliamps of
                     current.

       The trigger for  a  and  b  would be the outputs from a free running
       unbalanced multivibrator. Unbalanced  means  that one side will stay
       on longer than  the  other.  Matching sets of transistors  are  used
       because we do not want the electrons from the collector to return to
       the positive side of the battery after they pass through the coil.

       If the positive  side  of  the  collector  remains  connected to the
       positive side of the battery we may run the risk of having an analoy
       of a capacitor in the form of a coil.

       The beauty of the multivibrator is that when one side is conducting
       the other is off. The frequency that these devices run at is easily
       controlled and is within the engineering skill set of hobbists.
