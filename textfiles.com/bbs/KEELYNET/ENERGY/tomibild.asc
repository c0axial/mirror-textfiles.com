The following file contains construction details for the device described in
the original file TMIDEVIC.  It was built from a dream back in 1978 by Stewart
Harris of Las Vegas.  The principle has now been demonstrated by several
KeelyNet Associates, all of whom are very excited with the prospects.
Needless to say, everyone agrees that a circular version would allow tapping
of energy from the magnetic drive.

The TMIDEVIC file was sent to KeelyNet by Glenda Stocks and first proven by
Norman Comparini.  Norm called me and said his model worked.  I then built
one and it too worked.  From that point, several e-mail exchanges got others
involved and now it is taking off bigtime.

This past year, John Searle spoke at both the ISNE (International Society for
New Energy out of Fort Collins) and ITS (International Tesla Society out of
Colorado Springs).  He made reference to his circular track demonstration
which could be demonstrated on a desktop.

As I understand this circular track, it consisted of hills and valleys on
which was placed a 'roller magnet'.  The roller magnet would then begin to
circulate around the track under its own power, gaining speed with each
revolution.  This is the basis of Searl's SEG (Space Energy Generator) and his
flying disk.  Many KeelyNetters who have duplicated the initial Harris linear
magnetic drive also have seen the correlation with the Searl circular track.

The TMIDEVIC file was a general description, this file TOMIBILD (for Theory of
Magnetic Instability) will provide complete details to test it yourself.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stewart Harris had a dream back in 1978 which showed him how to make a
magnetic track that would power itself.  He built it the next day  using
cardboard, scotch tape and off-the-shelf disc magnets from Radio Shack.  It
worked just as he saw it in the dream.

Attempts to patent it were unsuccessful, causing Stewart to put it away since
1978.  Within the past couple of years, Stewart decided to put it out on the
networks and see what came of it.  The concept was mercilessly flamed
(insulted and made fun of) on the InterNet.  This was from people who did not
try to comprehend what was claimed or to duplicate the device.  Stewart was
very disappointed in the reactions.

Back in early January 1995, the TMIDEVIC file was sent to KeelyNet.  It was
constructed by several KeelyNet experimenters and found to WORK just as
described.  The inventor has been notified of our successes and is very much
enthused by such positive feedback.

The device is quite simple and has numerous possible configurations.  It is
based on an anomalous effect relating to the instability of joined magnets.
There is a thrust from the magnetic fields causing the moveable roller to push
up and over a ramp.  Gravity then causes the roller to move down the decline.

It is believed the device can be configured in a circular, see-saw or zig-zag
track to run on its own power.  By the time you read this, it will hopefully
be in production as a novelty toy and probably have been arranged to rotate a
shaft for power transfer from the magnetic repulsion.

By all means, do not let this stop you from experimenting with it.  The cost
will range anywhere from $10 to $30 for the magnets.  We here at KeelyNet want
everyone to be aware of this, please experiment with it and share your
findings with others.

This is a MAJOR DISCOVERY that anyone can build from off the shelf Radio Shack
magnets.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To construct your own TOMI (Theory Of Magnetic Instability) device;

    1)  For the ONE ramp test
           Buy 30 circular magnets (with the hole in the middle) from Radio
           Shack, these cost $1.69 for 5 magnets, so the magnets will cost
           about $10.00
        For the TWO ramp test
           Buy 50 circular magnets (with the hole in the middle) from Radio
           Shack, about $17.00
    2)  Take some stiff cardboard and make two hills (each hill consists of an
        incline and a decline, experiment with the angle, about 30 degrees)
    3)  Make three rolls (or five rolls if you are using 2 ramps) of 10
        magnets each (connect the magnets to form 10 magnet stacks, kind of
        like a roll of Lifesavers
    4)  Tape these magnets together with scotch tape
    5)  The ones for the side of the ramps are called RUNNERS, one other 10
        magnet roll is used as the ROLLER that moves up the incline between
        the RUNNERS
    4)  On each ramp (incline), you attach one roll of magnets running up each
        side, so that's two magnet rolls per incline and NONE on the decline
    5)  The RUNNER magnets on the sides should arranged to be of opposite
        polarity, that is, North at the top on one side, South at the top on
        the opposite side
    6)  The ROLLER should be placed at the base of the ramp with its poles
        facing like poles on the RUNNERS, since LIKE magnetic poles REPEL,
        this will provide the repulsion you require to make the ROLLER move up
        the incline between the RUNNERS.

For the Harris device, the 'over the hump' necessary for any perpetual motion
device is provided by the downward push of gravity on the roller as it moves
down the decline.  The inertia of the moving roller must be sufficient to get
it past the attractive end of the guide magnets and over the apex of the
incline/decline.  This is something you will have to provide for in other
configurations if you want to make it 'perpetual'.

One other tip, the more magnets you stack together, the weaker will be the
overall force.  A common idea is to create a circle of connected magnets that
will provide a continuous acceleration.  It sounds good, but in fact will not
work, so don't go out and buy $100s of bucks worth of magnets.  Try it
yourself by stacking 20 or so magnets together and see how the field weakens.

The following diagrams show how simple it is to reproduce, experiment with it,
have fun and we would all appreciate being informed of any improvements you
might make.
