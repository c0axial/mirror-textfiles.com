The following file is the most fascinating information that has come out in
dozens of years with respect to some of Henry Morays' experiments with the
production of electrical energy using cold cathode chemical reactions.
To get up to speed about Moray's work, please refer to the files MORAY1.ASC
through MORAY4.ASC on KeelyNet.

If you contact Bruce Perrault based on information specified in this document,
please mention you got it from the KeelyNet file COLDFISS.  Bruce is looking
for confirmations and people serious about not only duplicating the tube but
EXPANDING the power output. Thanks!!

Bruce Perrault has been experimenting with what he calls COLD FISSION for
several years.  His experiments were first brought to the attention of the
International Tesla Society which led to a one hour interview by ITS President
J. W. McGinnis.  The following is how Bruce's work came to the attention of
KeelyNet;

Did you hear the Extraordinary Sciences Hour on November 12th?  There's a guy
named Bruce Perault (guessing at the spelling here) who has built Moray-like
devices using ionized chlorine tubes and iron pyrite as the detector.  He said
Moray used molybdenum sulfide, but iron pyrite is the second-best thing.  The
ITS is selling plans for $39.95, for a device that will cost about $500 to
build.  He says he's getting 50KW out of a device weighing about 60 pounds.

Hi Folks!  After reading a public message (1443), I was so fascinated I had to
call JW McGinnis and find out the truth about it.  So here's the story (but
first read message 1443);
...
A fellow named Bruce Perrault claims he has discovered how to build a 'cold
cathode' vacuum tube, similar to the one developed by Henry Moray.  Perrault's
tube uses CHLORINE and he claims he has a WORKING prototype which produces 250
Watts.  He believes it is scalable and has plans detailing one that might
produce the 50KW which Moray achieved.
...
The plans are being distributed through the International Tesla Society for
$39.95.  The order number is 700032.  Their voice phone is 719-475-0918, or
800-397-0137 and their FAX is 719-475-0582.
...
JW says this guy contacted him and explained his device, from there JW invited
him to be interviewed on the Extraordinary Science hourly show.  He has NOT
seen a working model of this device and the inventor sends the plans to ITS
where they sell them for him.  JW says this device will be in the next
Extraordinary Science Journal and they might even do a video of it kind of
like the one Bearden did with Sweets device, where everything is shown,
measurements are made and various devices operated from the produced power....
...
So, if you are interested, go for it, DESPITE what Don Lancaster says, we
CAN'T waste ALL of our time on this 'pseudoscience' stuff....>>> Jerry
                   ----------------------------------------
I ordered the plans from ITS and they arrived this past Thursday.  They
consist of a stack of papers about 3/4" thick in a loose folder.  Many are
patents relating to energy tapping from the air, thermal and other processes,
a 1956 FATE magazine article about Henry Moray's Radiant Energy Receiver and
how Moray could do transmutations!!!, and the inventor's (Bruce Perrault)
patent for his energy generation system.

At the end of the folder are several papers showing diagrams of how the device
is constructed, another paper describing how the parts are assembled and a
resource list to buy the parts necessary.  Though I did not see any power
claims (JW said 250 Watts), it is a fascinating compilation of information to
backup why Perrault's invention should work.

The device consists of an evacuated cylinder with an anode on one end and a
cathode on the other, both separated by sand.  The unit is filled with
chlorine gas and ionized by a 4KV pulsetrain.  The pulsetrain can be adjusted
to set the frequency of the device, from DC to as high as you want.  I suggest
you order the planset, if for no other reason than to support the inventor in
further experiments which he plans to share for quite nominal fees.  If there
is sufficient demand, he may even offer kits, maybe even with preconstructed
cylinders, you just attach an ionizer and boom, power comes out of it.

Oh, by the way, he says you just have to tickle it with the high voltage to
begin the pumping action.  Once it gets going, the thing runs on its own.
Perrault also indicates power production will degrade over time and the
cylinder will need replacement or rebuilding, although possibly a shot of
fresh chlorine gas might make it run a bit longer.

I thought it VERY SIMILAR to Chernetskii's PLASMATRON, which also uses a
plasma that is pumped with high density magnetic pulses to produce over-unity.
The addition of the chlorine gas is a twist and the inventor indicates these
cylinders can be ganged or scaled up for higher power levels.  GET A COPY!

Coincidentally, on Friday, 12/14, I got a phone call from Mr. Perrault because
Bruce Meland, publisher of 'Electrifying Times' (keeps abreast of current
research/technology relating to electric cars and road rally events where they
are tested) (503) 388-1908, had sent him one of the KeelyNet Roundtable
newsletters.  That newsletter was VSRTNOV.95, and intrigued Mr. Perrault
enough to want to get a copy of that paper.  The quote from the newsletter
follows;
                       > > > > >              < < < < <

  ...this was preceded by a short review from the Borderlands Journal of the
  discoveries of Nathan Stubblefield with 'earth batteries' and how they could
  be used to provide electrical energy directly from the earth....Stubblefield
  routinely powered a SCORE of CARBON ARC LAMPS 24 hours per day from this
  earth battery system.  There are numerous other interesting statements in
  the article that report on devices which are even now unknown and
  misunderstood.  Gerry Vassilatos did a marvelous report that could easily be
  expanded into a full book to include all the details and pictures that are
  still available.   If you might want to read this full article and/or
  subscribe to Borderlands, backissues are $6.95 and a yearly subscription is
  still only $25.  Phone (707) 825-7733 or FAX (707) 825-7779.  While you are
  at it, ask if they might be able to run off a copy of the Farnsworth FUSOR
  article published earlier this year.

  ...Another recent Borderland article from a few months back dealt with the
  Farnsworth FUSOR and Multipactor.  This unit multiplies electrons by
  extracting space energy from the environment for power accumulation.  A
  recent packet of amazing material was sent to Keelynet, courtesy of Mr.
  Steve Hall.  Steve works with Charles Yost at Electric Spacecraft Journal
  (704) 683-0313, FAX (704) 683-3511, subscription $24 per year.

  This incredible information (written by Rodney Sego in May 1981) correlates
  the Multipactor with the Moray power generating system.  The packet had a
  document that I never knew existed and which consisted of an interview with
  a close Moray family member (believed to be Chester Todd) who recounted all
  that he had seen from the original Moray experiments to the final version.
  As a result, this document will wind up as a new Moray file to be placed on
  KeelyNet and transferred to the InterNet for Bill Beaty's Science page.

  The document provides details on power generation by the use of radioactive
  elements to produce an ionized area from alpha emissions and in conjunction
  with electron multiplier technology as used in the Multipactor.  Everything
  points to a means of using an extremely minute excitation current to
  stimulate a very large power production.  Floyd Sweets VTA also used this
  phenomenon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I find it REMARKABLY coincidental how the Moray document, kindly shared with
KeelyNet by Steve Hall and bearing a November 3rd postmark, preceded the email
comment by Jim Shaffer letting us all know about the November 12th Perrault
radio interview with ITS president J.W. McGinnis.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the VSRTDEC.95 Roundtable newsletter;

Mr. Perrault says he has successfully operated his energy tube for 7 months
outputting 200 Watts before it gave out.  A platinum wire was used as the
resistive element to load the circuit.  Bruce says it is a slow fission
process and has given KeelyNet FULL permission to post his plans online as
well as pass them to computer networks through the country.  A very nice guy
and we are exchanging information and contacts that will be shared with
everyone.

Bruce says he just wants the plans out to everyone and they will soon be
selling the tubes, beginning with basic low energy versions and slowly
progressing to more powerful versions as people get involved in experimenting
and supporting this type of research.  The advanced tube construction will
remain a trade secret and available through a future distribution network.

The main thing now is to let people know what is going on and how the thing
works, with support from others who have duplicated it.  An excellent
approach!  Speaking just for myself, I think Bruce would appreciate some
donations to help him along.  He is very sincere and when you see the info,
YOU WILL BE IMPRESSED, especially as others post their successful
replications!!!

Abstract

A method is disclosed for generating electrical energy, including a new and
novel device.  The device includes electropositive and electronegative
electrodes.  The electrodes are provided with electrical connections leading
to the electrodes.

A sufficient amount of radiant energy applied to a reactive gas causes the gas
to react ELECTROCHEMICALLY with the electropositive electrode.  This causes an
electrical current to flow between the electropositive and electronegative
electrodes.  An electronic circuit is used to absorb and convert the generated
electric current.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
METHOD OF UTILIZING A RADIANT ENERGY FOR THE GENERATION OF EFFICIENT
ELECTRICAL ENERGY AND DEVICE

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a device for the conversion of radiant energy
to electrical energy and more particularly, to the utilization of GAS
IONIZATION to effect an electrochemical reaction.  This device absorbs radiant
energies emitted by natural or synthetic reactions, more particularly to a
device and method that provides improved performance over prior art converters
that convert radiant energies into electrical power.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are devices that convert radiant energy to electrical current, with poor
results.

U.S. Patent Nos. 685,957 and 685,958 issued both patents on November 5, 1901,
utilizes air-borne ionized particles to charge an electrical capacitor.  The
accumulated ions jump a spark-gap and discharge through a load.  One
difficulty known to exist with this system is the low useable energy that
develops.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
U.S. Patent No. 1,540,998 issued June 9, 1925, calls for increased collecting
surfaces of electrical capacitors, in an attempt to capture more energy.  Yet
another method converts high voltage and low current strength to voltages more
suitable and of greater current.  This system is impractical because of the
required cumbersome balloons and collectors involved.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Atomic batteries generate electric currents by the disintegration of
radioactive substances.  William R. Corliss discusses the direct use of
ionized particles expelled by radioisotopes in his report; Direct Conversion
of Energy (1964) pp. 28-29.  In this report high-velocity ionized negative
particles emitted by strontium-90 creates a current of ionized particles.

The charge on the particles becomes neutralized by a metallic cylinder.  The
neutralized particles will find their way back to the strontium-90 becoming
again ionized.  This cycle repeats itself so long as the strontium-90 remains
radioactive.  The power generated by this method does not create USEABLE
amounts of electrical energy.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thermionic and thermoelectric energy conversion are discussed in U.S. Patent
No. 4,368,416 - James, deceased January 11, 1983.  One limitation known to
exist with converters of this type is the relatively large heat source
required to produce electrical power.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nuclear reactors generate heat by burning UO2.  This material is sensitive to
X-ray energy.  When the UO2 is exposed to X-ray energy it emits
photoelectrons.  The photoelectrons cause a chemical reaction.  Present day
nuclear reactors use a natural source of X-ray energy, called U235.  This
reaction produces heat.  This heat boils water that produces steam.

The steam powers a turbine which in turn generates electricity.  This type of
energy generator requires complex building materials that make this method
quite costly.  Consumers have paid billions of dollars to build these power
plants.  Furthermore no one seems to know what to do with the waste products
produced by these power plants.  The U235 breaks up forming highly toxic
radioisotopes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Despite the prior art that exists in this technology, it is believed that
previously there has not existed a small, compact electrical device capable of
generating usable levels of power.  It is the object of this invention to
provide a method embodying an improved device to furnish efficient electrical
power to a load.

The present invention removes limitations of past attempts to harness radiant
energies.  Toxis radioisotopes are not formed in the present invention.  The
primary object of the present invention is to provide a direct method for
converting radiant energy to electrical energy, and a new and novel device fo
converting radiant energy with high efficiencies.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Thus in accordance with the present invention, there is provided a method of
utilizing ionized particles for the generation of efficient electrical energy.

In the present invention, new and novel improvements are apparent.  The need
for an enormous collector surface no longer exists.  Transistors can now
replace the outdated spark gap and or high vacuum transmission tubes.  The
present invention efficiently converts ionizing energy to voltages suitable
for practical usage.

A source of X-ray energy is provided by the present invention.  This source
can be artificially generated and will not produce toxic radioisotopes.

Converted energy in the present invention may be directly available for
driving motors, lighting, production of heat and used in electrochemistry.

The method of the invention includes, means for exposing a REACTIVE GAS, such
as CHLORINE to a source of ionizing energy.

Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent
from the following description of the preferred embodiment of the present
invention, with references to the attached drawings, in which:

  Fig. 1 is a block diagram of the present invention;

  Fig. 2 is a diagram showing the present invention being exposed to a source
         of ionizing energy of extreme voltage and of short duration.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS

Thus in accordance with the present invention, there is provided a radiant
energy converter comprising a first metallic electrode made of ZINC METAL and
a second metallic electrode made of IRON SULFIDE nested parallel to the first
electrode.

A number of electrode couples may be used and still not depart from the spirit
of this invention.  The inter-electrode spacing contains the reactive gas
CHLORINE.  A number of gasses MAY BE USED and still not depart from the spirit
of this invention.  Means are also provided, at the end of the electrodes, to
provide external electrical leads from the electrodes to a load circuit.

The method to generate electrical energy also includes, with a device just
described, means for exposing the internal reactive gas to a radiant energy
source of sufficient strength.

The conversion of radiant energy to useful electrical energy is apparent.  The
small solid-state components of this apparatus make it a practical compact
unit.  An electronic circuit effects energy absorption.

The electronegative electrode may contain oxygen gas in the form of a solid.
Manganese dioxide may be used for this purpose.  The electropositive electrode
may contain hydrogen gas in the form of a solid.  Lithium hydride may be used
for this purpose.

The gasses react when the inter-electrode spacing of these electrodes is
subjected to radiant energy pulses.  The gasses become SUPER CONDUCTIVE.  This
causes the oxygen and hydrogen gasses to react chemically with minute energy
loss.  Chemical energy is now converted to electrical energy with extreme
efficiency.  Furthermore,  an electrical transformer can be utilized to
transform this electromotive energy to a usable voltage.

Referring now to FIG. 1 of the drawings,

(1) consists of a gas tight vessel.  Provision is made for an inlet tube (2)
to introduce chlorine gas (3).  Provision is made for iron sulfide electrode
(4) and zinc electrode (5).

ANY NUMBER of electrode couples, or gas combinations may be utilized and still
not depart from the spirit of this invention.  A source of ionization (6) is
provided.

The chlorine gas (3) must become ionized in order for it to bombard the
electrode (5).  When the chlorine gas (3) is ionized it becomes a conductor,
its conductivity is a measure of its ionization.

There are a number of ways to ionize the chlorine gas (3).  X-ray energies
emitted from the sun will ionize the chlorine gas (3).  Radioactive materials
will ionize the chlorine gas (3).  Pulsating high-voltage produced by an
electrical transformer will ionize the chlorine gas (3).

Any number of ionizing sources may be utilized and still not depart from the
spirit of my invention.  I stake my claim to the method of power generation.

If an electronic ionizing source (6) is used, once started, the energy
produced by said invention will keep the electronic circuit energized.

Initially the electronic circuit must be PRIMED by an outside power source
(7).  When said invention begins generating electrical energy the external
source (7) IS NO LONGER NEEDED.  A small rechargeable battery may be used as
the external source (7).  Said invention will keep the external source (7)
fully charged.

Greater amounts of energy can be stored in a compact manner than any
previously known electrochemical system.  Furthermore, if radiant energy is
used as the ionizing source its energy is converted into electrical power.

The voltage from said invention is very stable.  The output can be varied from
a non-pulsating, direct current, to a high frequency pulsating output.  The
output pulsation rate is varied by the rate in which the electronic ionizing
source (6) pulsates.

The pulsation rate of the ionizing source (6) is determined by its circuit
characteristics.  These characteristics are well known in the engineering
field.  Any number of known electronic circuits may be utilized for the
electronic ionizing source (6) and still not depart from the spirit of said
invention.  If the ionizing source comes from radiant energy the pulse rate is
a factor in the decay rate.

 *  This invention may use a resistant FABRIC dielectric woven to serve as a
    strong mechanical separator, at the same time sufficiently porous to
    PERMIT CIRCULATION of the gasses between electrodes.  Fabrics made of
    borosilicate (PYREX) fibers are particularly suitable for this invention.

In an additional phone conversation with Bruce on Friday, December 15th, he
said the pulses were very sharp spikes and occurred 20 times per second.  This
is based on a comment by Henry Moray in his book "The Sea of Energy".  These
spikes are necessary to maintain the fission reaction.

 *  I have found it advantageous to introduce CHLORINE GAS to the tube.  A
    high voltage electrostatic field renders the tube CONDUCTIVE.  When the
    tube becomes conductive, it PRODUCES ENERGY.  -- November 20th, 1992
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONSTRUCTION DETAILS

Radiant Energy tube Ionizer

Assemble as shown in the circuit diagrams.  The auto ignition coil as a
transformer and choke.  A choke will store energy in its windings as a
capacitor does.

In this device the ignition coil absorbs energy when a xenon flash-lamp is
triggered into conduction.  The flash-lamp behaves like an open circuit with
infinite resistance until it is triggered.  The flash-lamp is triggered by way
of a small, lightweight transformer that supplies a 4,000 volt pulse to the
lamp.  This pulse is capacitively coupled to the xenon gas inside the lamp.
This pulse initiates lamp conduction.  The xenon, once ionized by the 4KV
pulse, suddenly behaves like a switch of only a fraction of an ohm.  This
allows the coil to energize.

When the 4KV is removed the flash-lamp returns to its infinite resistance
state, it is again an open switch.  Energy that is stored in the ignition
coils primary windings discharge across the lamp.  This results in a moving
magnetic field that induces a series of high voltage surges from the secondary
windings of the coil.

This is an electronic device that generates AT LEAST 250,000 volts.  DO NOT
HANDLE this device unless you are familiar with high-voltage safety
precautions.  This device is POTENTIALLY dangerous.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Radiant Energy Tube

Dimensions of these tubes are NOT critical.  However, you must PACK DOWN the
powders HARD.

I have found that raw iron pyrite ORE serves well as the collector (anode) of
energy in these tubes.  Platinum and Palladium absorb MORE energy but they are
too expensive.  Iron pyrite ore works quite well and is inexpensive when
bought in bulk.  Pure zinc metal serves well as the emitter (cathode)
material.  Magnesium will work better but it is UNSTABLE and probably will
explode.  Do not use magnesium metal as your emitter material.  Lithium
Hydride as the emitter material will work best but it is expensive.

Chlorine gas is added to the tubes LAST.  You must make the tubes AIR-TIGHT.
All the air must be sucked out before the chlorine gas is introduced.  This
vacuum is not critical.  The chlorine gas is now allowed to fill the vacuum
tube.  Ambient pressure is fine.  Make sure the tubes are SEALED WELL.

You can buy bottled chlorine gas but be prepared to go through bureaucratic
red tape.  To avoid this hassle you must generate this gas yourself.  Calcium
Hypochlorite (swimming pool chlorinator) will release chlorine gas when water
is added to it.  Make sure that you are working in a well-ventilated area when
generating this gas.

Chlorine gas can accumulate in your lungs forming hydrochloric acid.  This
would cause SERIOUS lung damage.  Severe exposure could BE FATAL.  So take the
proper precautions and respect this material.  You must contain the Calcium
Hypochlorite in a closed vessel.  This vessel must have a valve and small
diameter rubber delivery hose that connects to the tubes.

I have used pvc-tubing as my containing vessel.  Make sure that you have a
pressure gage built into your gas generating container.  Pvc-tubing should not
exceed 100PSI of pressure.  This is the limit established by the manufacturers
of pvc-tubing.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Priming your Radiant Energy Converter

You may prime this device a number of ways.  You can use a 110 volt to 220
volt step-up transformer supplied by a 110 volt wall outlet, or you can build
the 12 volt DC inverter circuit and power it with a car battery.  You may even
prime the circuit with static electricity.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Replacing the Radiant Energy tubes

How long will the tubes last?  This will depend on the type of emitter
material used.  A new shot of chlorine gas MAY bring them back to life.  There
is no doubt in my mind that one of you will find better materials to lengthen
the life of the tubes.  There are materials that I would like to try but
finances have not permitted this at this time.

Hopefully there will be enough interest in this power generator so that I may
continue my research with the device.  I am confident that the tubes could be
made to last a long time before needing to be replaced.
