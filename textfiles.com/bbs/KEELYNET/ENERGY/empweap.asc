Hi Rich!

RB> I would be interested in hearing more about the High Power Microwave (HPM)
RB> weapon system: how it works, power output, narrow or wide beam
RB> application, range, deployment status, etc.

The HPM demonstrator we built consisted of basically two sections. A so-called
Marx generator, which produces a very brief, very high voltage, high current
pulse, and a magnetron/antenna assembly, which converts the pulse current into
an intense burst of microwave energy and then directs it towards a target.

The demonstrator was housed in a trailer which had its own 15kW diesel
generator, and they used to tow it out to the desert to test it. The testing
was done at the Cibola Range of the Yuma Proving Ground near Yuma, Arizona.

A commercial 100 kV DC power supply was used to charge the 20-stage Marx,
where it charged its capacitors in parallel, and then via a series of spark
gaps discharged them in series.

With the power supply set to 27 kV, the Marx would output a 265 kV, 3500
ampere, 21.4-nanosecond pulse. The spark gap array was pressurized with air,
and the air pressure was regulated so as to control the point at which the
Marx would fire.  This allowed the system to operate over a range of output
power levels.

One megawatt was a typical pulse-power output, and with typical 50% magnetron
efficiency, a half-megawatt RF pulse could be achieved. The negative-polarity
output pulse from the Marx was coupled to a rather large, cold-cathode
magnetron tube equipped with a superconducting magnet.

The magnet was cooled to superconducting temperatures by liquid helium, and
the magnetron itself was evacuated by a small vacuum pump. A specially-
designed magnet power supply (1 volt, 70 amperes) was used to energize the
magnet assembly.

A waveguide couples the resulting microwave energy (4.4 GHz) to a 10-foot
diameter dish antenna, which was mounted several feet above the trailer.

Precautions were necessary around the operating equipment to protect
personnel.  Strong magnetic field, X-radiation from the magnetron, and RF
hazard from the antenna all had to be considered.  A zone of "denied
occupancy" was set up in front of the antenna, which was basically a 12-degree
cone which extended some 800 meters out in front of the antenna.

The most intense part of the beam occupied a 6-degree angle, and in the center
of the beam at a range of 30.5 meters, 9.85 watts per sq cm was developed. I
never went out to the test range myself, but the guys who did told me they
used to set up electronic equipment downrange, and try to destroy it.

Apparently it worked great!   They mentioned personal computers, and LCD
wristwatches, amongst other things. If they tested it on any military
electronics, I was not told specifically what type of equipment.

I did hear, however, that an Army land mine was detonated at a distance of
two miles. I was told by one person who had been with the company a long time,
that there was a videotape floating around someplace that showed a rat inside
a waveguide with a clear window on the side. The rat was then subject to ever-
increasing HPM pulses, which caused him to experience (apparently) great pain,
and then death.

I do not know the power levels used in this experiment, and I never heard
anything about this particular demonstrator being used on any humans or other
biological specimens.  The date of all this was 1987 to 1989. The company had
some old photos of other HPM and EMP simulation equipment, which to me looked
like they could have been taken in the 1960s.

In approximately 1990, the company built a two-man carried portable HPM
generator.  One guy carried the Marx generator (sulphur hexaflouride gas
insulated), high voltage supply (50kV) and battery pack on his back, and the
other carried the magnetron tube and antenna.

The two were connected together by a high voltage coaxial cable. Apparently,
this device was a complete failure. It only produced a 300-watt output,
probably due to not having a strong enough magnet on the magnetron. Since man-
carrying a Dewar full of liquid helium was out of the question, they used
barium-ferrite permanent magnets.

I remember them taking a photograph of it before turning it over to the
government sometime in 1990. As far as current deployment status, I really do
not know. I do know that the Army was very pleased with the HPM demonstrator
(trailer-mounted version), but shortly after all this, the HPM division of the
company was sold to General Atomics Corporation, the four guys and all the
equipment then being transferred there.

Up to that point, it was obvious that the HPM/EMP research had been going on
for many years, and it was very well funded.  The huge screen rooms they had,
and all the state-of-the-art analysis and data logging equipment was testimony
to that. That Marx generator was truly a work of art!

RB> Also, I have been shown by a retired air Force Colonel a photo of an
RB> Electro-Magnetic Pulse weapon. Am also interested in power output, target
RB> types, range, and deployment status.  I believe one was used near Eglin
RB> Air Force Base/Hurlburt Field USAF/CIA/Special Forces headquarters near
RB> Mary Esther, Florida Panhandle. What do you know about Florida and New
RB> Mexico sites specifically?

Earlier this year, I spoke to abductee Leah Haley on the phone. She was very
gracious in her information, and sent me a color Xerox of a supposed EMP
weapon located on the beach at Eglin in Florida. Maybe you've heard her story
of how the alien spacecraft she was in was shot down there on the beach by
such a weapon. How she and her alien (and human???) captors were taken into
custody by military personnel.

She sneaked back there on the beach at a later time, and photographed the
device. I have a couple of .GIF images of it on my BBS at (619) 635-8685. They
are HALEY1.GIF and HALEY2.GIF in the misc image files area. There's also a
text file, HALEY1.TXT in the misc textfiles area, which contains her story as
related on Art Bell's radio program.

I would be curious as to whether or not it looks like the photo you saw of
such a device. I don't know too much about EMP weapons specifically.  I did
speak to an engineer who works for a high voltage power supply company in New
Jersey a few months ago.

We got into talking about some kind of high-power switch device he built
specifically for EMP generation.  Apparently, EMP generators (the electrical
kind as opposed to the nuclear kind) also discharge a high voltage pulse via a
fast switch, like a spark gap.

The current pulse is delivered to an exotically-designed sort of a Tesla
coil, but the device resonates at several frequencies, from a few MHz to
over 100 MHz. The output from this exotic transformer is delivered to a
spherical, ball-like electrode which is located in the center of a huge (30'
or more?) dish antenna.

He told me that the DIA discovered several years ago that EMP was the way to
go as opposed to HPM, because of the wide frequency output spectrum developed
by an EMP device. This means that it is much more difficult for an enemy to
design their electronics to withstand a hit by EMP.

HPM, on the other hand is easier to guard against, if you know the single-
channel output frequency of the device. He told me that the largest EMP
generator in the U.S. is located at Kirtland AFB in New Mexico. The work he
did for the DIA was apparently 5-6 years ago, and his PFN (Pulse Forming
Network) generated a 400-nanosecond pulse, quite a bit longer (and therefore
possibly more devastating) than the 20-nsec pulse of our HPM demonstrator.

He mentioned Electromagnetic Missiles were something they were developing,
which used some technique called Brittingham-wave generation.  Something about
a paper written by a T.T. Woo of Harvard some 5-12 years ago.  As far as EMP
weapons at Eglin, he did confirm that is where a significant ammount of pre-
deployment testing of energy weapons is done.

I asked him specifically about the possibility of shooting down UFOs with such
a weapon. Although he said he had no knowledge of such an application, he did
believe UFOs were real, as he saw one about 30 years ago himself.  He was
familiar with the Biefield-Brown effect, and did indicate to me that such a
weapon could likely interfere severely with the operation of such a device.

On a slightly related issue, last spring I visited a sister company, who had
developed some kind of adaptive-mirror telescope imaging equipment for the
(get this) BMDO (Ballistic Missile Defense Organization), the keepers of the
mysterious Clementine spacecraft moon mapping mission.

BMDO was plastered all around this place. This telescope is basically a
reflector-type, but the reflector is made up of zillions of 1/4" hexagonal
segments which move rapidly under computer control. A laser beam measures
atmospheric turbulence in the viewing angle of the mirror, and adjusts its
many segments rapidly, so as to cancel the effects of the intervening
atmosphere.

The end result is that images of space rivaling those obtainable outside the
atmosphere, are obtained from the ground. Now here's the clincher: The people
there told me that the equipment was being tested at Eglin!  And, a little
model of it in a glass case in the lobby of this company looks EXACTLY like
the truck-mounted dish thing in Leah Haley's photograph!

The people at this company told me that the BMDO will use this telescope to
accurately track and target incomming nuclear missiles, so they can shoot them
down. But wait, I thought that Star Wars was cancelled! Maybe they're tracking
and targeting UFOs with this device, and then shooting them down with EMP
weapons.

Perhaps Leah Haley's photo is only of the telescope device site, and she did
not see the actual EMP weapon, which could easily be located at a different
location.

RB> BTW, Hurricane Opal smashed right through Eglin/Hurlburt, and even set off
RB> a tornado which took out Eglin's water tower plus other damage.  Gaia
RB> karma?  Sounds good to me!

Rich, do you have a photo in your posession of the EMP device you mention?  I
would really like to see it. I have a copy of the Operations and Maintenance
manual for the HPM demonstrator, and would be glad to mail you a copy. Please
give me your address again, and I'll send it off to you. Regards, Chris
