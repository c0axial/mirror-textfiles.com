                              Emerging Energy Science
                                + D A T A B A S E +

       The National Research Council of Canada demanded:

       Examine and describe  the  theory,  rationale, research, experiments
       and devices -- whether theoretical or actual -- of what might become
       future energy science and technology.

       More than 300 researchers in the  Planetary  Association  for  Clean
       Energy's International collaborative scientific network responded.

       The exercise has  grown into an electronic database.   Included  are
       verified items from   English,  French,  German,  Russian,  Italian,
       Spanish and Japanese sources --all  in  a classified format for easy
       sifting of useful information.

       In updates, included   will  be  key  documents  of   latest   world
       developments in this  domain  --  all edited from an independent and
       advanced scientific perspective.

       Features

       References are given  by  author,   title,   bibliographic  details,
       specially edited annotation of content,  interpretive commentary and
       by descriptors derived from a list of over several hundred.

       Searches can be  made  by  record  number  and  by   title;  through
       annotations and commentary  (up to 16 kb text) ; by descriptor tags;
       and, finally, by  first letter of  author  or  title.   It  is  also
       possible to sift files.

       Updates on quarterly and annual basis.

       Note:  If you  think  that this price looks high, please give Andrew
       Michrowski a call.  I have gone through  a  considerable  amount  of
       grief over it.  When I first put the thing together, it was with the
       understanding that my labors went into something that  anybody could
       afford.

       I have heard  no  word  from  Tom  Bearden  on  this, even though he
       supposedly supplied a great deal of the data.

       Also, I had hopes that this database would be expanded into a true
       Encyclopedia of Energy, including  the  actual  articles  instead of
       just the bibliographic references.  Since the book  version  of this
       has been published,  there  has  been  at  least  20,000  additional
       references that could have been added,  but  haven't been because of
       lack of sales (I wonder why?).

       If there's anybody out there who would like to drop either Andrew or
       Tom Bearden a line concerning this, that's fine with me.  Go for it.

       Personally, I'm pretty disgusted with the whole situation  and ready
       to let go of it.  If you want to drop me a line, my address is:
