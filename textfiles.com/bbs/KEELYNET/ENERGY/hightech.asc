       Stan Deyo was one of many Air Force cadets during the 1960's who
       dreamed of serving his country as an Air Force pilot.  That was,
       until Deyo learned that something strange was going on in the Air
       Force Academy where he was stationed.
            "Because of what he discovered while an unwilling 'guinea pig'
       in certain experiments that were secretly being conducted by a
       covert organization working within the military, Stan Deyo had to
       flee the United States for a new home half way around the world.
       Running as far as he could, the bearded scientist ended up in Perth,
       Australia, where he surfaced to tell his incredible saga of a
       conspiracy so sinister that it doesn't seem possible that something
       like this could actually transpire in the birthplace of George
       Washington, Abe Lincoln or John F. Kennedy.
            Deyo had enlisted into the United States Air Force and was sent
       for special training to the highly prestigious Air Force Academy
       located in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
            "...We  were  the  elite  from  all  over  America,  especially
       selected for a secret purpose we knew nothing about," he told PEOPLE
       MAGAZINE, an Australia weekly news magazine not to be confused with
       the celebrity profile magazine of the same name published in the
       U.S.
            "They got control of our minds when we were asleep and fed us
       the most advanced physics for months on end.  Then some of us began
       to realize something was happening to our minds and we rebelled.
            "After two years, they failed the entire class--180 of us.  We
       knew too much.  I'm speaking out now because I believe the world
       should know what they are up to, as well as for my own protection."
            As Deyo explains it, the Sixties were a turbulent period even
       as far as the U.S. government was concerned.  For some unexplainable
       reason, Stan Deyo found himself along with his classmates in the
       middle of an "intelligence war" between the FBI and the CIA, with
       the CIA bound and determined to keep the lid on a brand new form of
       technology directly related to UFOs.
            The CIA in conjunction with military-industrial "big business"
       has for a period of several years been in collusion, Deyo alleges,
       on findings that center around the development of a type of disk or
       saucer-shaped, antigravity machine that originated out of 'alien'
       technology.  According to Deyo's scenario, the U.S. is worried that
       sooner or later they will run out of conventional fuel sources and
       that the 'elite' and powerful will need a revolutionary technology

                                      Page 1





       in order to survive, and no doubt maintain their control over the
       populations of the earth.  So they contacted General Electric,
       Sperry Rand and Bell Aircraft to spearhead a drive to develop this
       new  technology,  which  can  whirl  a  disc-like  craft through
       interplanetary space at thousands of miles a second using the minds
       of the craft's crew members to navigate the Earth-made UFOs.  This
       is where Deyo's training was supposedly to come in handy.  Because
       of his intelligence level, he was to be made one of the ship's
       pilots as soon as his mental capabilities had been 'stretched'
       through hypnosis and an advanced form of electronic 'mind control'.
            Anonymous deep-level 'Intelligence' insider 'Commander X',
       while referring to Stan Deyo's experiences, stated:
            "...One of the most astounding things Deyo said--and this
       was almost ten years ago (i.e. around the late 1970's and early
       '80's - Branton)--was that he felt one of the staunchest
       supporters of this radically new anti-gravity technology was none
       other than the late William P. Lear--John Lear's father!
            "At the time, Lear Sr. was quoted by the Associated Press as
       having said: 'I can't help but feel flying saucers are real,
       because of numerous manifestations over long periods of time with
       many simultaneous observations by reliable observers.'--And this
       is the clincher: 'THERE ARE NOW SERIOUS EFFORTS IN PROGRESS TO
       PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF ANTI-GRAVITATIONAL FORCES AND TO CONVERT
       ATOMIC ENERGY DIRECTLY TO ELECTRICITY...'
            Commander X continues: "For those who hold suspicions that
       John Lear might--at least sometimes--be responsible for dealing
       from the 'bottom of the deck'--providing as much in the way as
       'disinformation' as valid 'information'--we can't help but
       theorize about the significance of the above quote attributed to
       his father, and the possibility that some of what John Lear is
       telling us is meant to steer our attention toward 'aliens',
       rather than look right under our very noses at an Earthly
       technology that may be advanced beyond what we are currently
       taught is achievable through modern day science.
            "We wonder if perhaps there isn't to be found substantiation
       behind the rumor that Lear Aircraft Company (a firm that John's
       dad founded) is directly involved in some sort of research and
       development project(s) involving anti-gravity and the
       manufacturing of UFOs made right here on Earth.
            "One possible scenario is that John Lear found out about
       this Top Secret project--perhaps while eavesdropping--and this is
       his way of 'spilling the beans' without implicating his father or
       anyone else as the source."

       In 1990, researcher Val Valerian released a peculiar document
       which was sent to him by another researcher.  The document is
       actually a list of several military personnel; however, the
       strange thing about this document was the title-heading.
            Some researchers believe that the deepest levels of the
       Government are involved in an on-going 'covert space program'
       utilizing some very remarkable aerospace and propulsion
       technologies.  However, the very nature of this program, the
       clandestine (and possibly illegal) means by which it is funded,
       as well as possibly the means by which they came across this
       'technology', has apparently led the 'Secret' Government into
       keeping these activities one of the world's top secrets, and

                                      Page 2





       apparently they have enforced this cover-up with 'deadly force'.
       But perhaps one of the most important reasons for the secrecy is
       the allegations that SOME groups within the secret government
       have allegedly in the face of 'superior alien technology', in a
       sense 'surrendered' to a malevolent alien race and have become
       their 'agents' on earth.
            Is it also possible, as many researchers and prominent
       military, government and industrial personnel are actually
       confirming, that the 'secret government' is utilizing this
       advanced super-technology which they have hidden from the public,
       to carry out a clandestine space program involving not only
       manned flights to the moon, but also involving manned BASES on
       the moon and, some claim, Mars as well?  There appears to be
       enough evidence mounting to cause the public to at least consider
       these claims.  Actually, if one carefully examines all of the
       various claims and how they merge together, and if one studies
       the various theories and arguments concerning Einstein's 'unified
       field' theory and the apparent underlying connection between
       electromagnetism and gravity waves, etc., such a scenario would
       not be outside the realm of possibility.
            The document referred to contains in the title heading both
       the terms 'Starfleet International' and 'United Federated
       Planets'.  Why would such a statement appear on a military
       document?  Could it be that, although perhaps somewhat
       presumptuously, a secret group of 'astronauts' constantly travel
       back and forth from ultra secret bases on or below the earth, the
       moon, and mars; and have in anticipation of an ever-growing
       interplanetary network named this organization 'Starfleet
       International' and/or the 'United Federated Planets'?
            Val Valerian gives the following 'introduction' and story
       behind the document:
            "...Researcher George Andrews forwarded this puzzle to us.
       From the introduction, it might seem that this thing was complete
       bunk.  There it might have stayed, except that WE TRACED 11
       PEOPLE ON THE LIST TO ACTUALLY BEING IN THE MILITARY.  What does
       it mean?"
            The following introduction is given by George Andrews: "A
       friend who wishes to remain anonymous, who lives in a large city,
       recently woke about 3 A.M. with a strong but apparently
       irrational impulse to get dressed and to go to an all-night
       photostat place.  As she was entering, she noticed a man dressed
       in a Navy officers uniform who was just leaving, who threw some
       papers into the trash barrel near the door.  She made her copies
       and was about to leave and had another impulse to retrieve what
       the Navy officer had thrown away.  She came up with these pages.
       Under normal circumstances, the news that the Unites States Navy
       has a flying disk named the U.S.S. Excalibur (and U.S.S. Concord?
       - Branton), operated by a crew of four, would be cause for
       celebration... however (unless) this achievement is the result of
       the collaboration of the 'Greys'..."  Andrews goes on to suggest
       that they might, because of their collaboration with the 'Greys',
       be forced to take part in offensive attacks against the 'Blonds',
       who have allegedly had ancient conflict with the Greys.
            The introduction goes on to state that those names which
       appear with an (x), are actually people that are in the military.
       Take special note of names like Ferguson, Caskey, Taylor,
       Burrall, Stevens, and Miller which are repeated more than once.
       Possible signs of Nepotism?
            George Andrews suspects that 'Starfleet International'

                                      Page 3





       consists of human-military personnel only, while the 'United
       Federated Planets' may somehow tie-in with the non-human
       'entities' such as the 'Serpent Race' or the 'Greys'.  Below is a

       PEA Research (105 Serra Way., Ste. 176., Milpitas, CA.  95035)
       made the following comments in one of their 'Files' (collections
       of large amounts of documents, research and other informations
       related to UFO's):
            "...Ramifications of MJ-12.
            "If the U.S.A.F. test-flew a disk and was successful, what's
       to prevent them from using the same saucer to transport men and
       materials to the moon and mars?  They would also be in a position
       to exploit the archeological artifacts of the pyramids and sphinx
       in the valley of Illysium on Mars.  Also they could recover
       artifacts of previous races on the surface of the moon.  With the
       aid of NASA satellites they could map and mine the rare earth
       (Moon,Mars) minerals at the expense of the tax payers while at
       the same time claim that we have nothing better in our technology
       than space shuttles (rocket power).
            "In the Canadian Geomagnetic project was successful with
       their free-energy geomagnetic motor, then why haven't we seen
       free-energy engines for the home and auto instead of hearing
       about oil shortages?
            "If the President of the USA is allowed only certain
       appointed staff by the Constitution and Congress - are the
       members of MJ-12 outside of the limits of the Constitution or did
       Congress give the President the power to set up a Secret
       Government (non-elected) without the public right to vote on this
       choice of the governing of the various military and non-military
       branches of the united states?
            "When the MJ-12 use non-appropriated funds for their Secret
       operations are they using money from the Black Budget?  If so,
       when did we cast a vote stating that ANY branch of the Government
       can use the taxpayers money without giving an account or being
       held accountable for it?
            "When MJ-12 refuse to grant FOIA requests because of
       National Security reasons, is it because the USA won't be secure
       against foreign earthly powers, alien powers or against the wrath
       of a misled and deceived United States public (the Voters)?
            "Can laws be passed to Guarantee that various branches of
       the Government will be held accountable for shredding of
       classified documents?  How about passing laws to guarantee stiff
       jail sentences for underlings (secretaries, lower rank personnel)
       that carry out the command to shred confidential files?
            "If the top of the mountain is corrupt, what about the
       foundation that was later raised under it.  If a Secret
       Government is illegal, what about all of the secret projects it
       started and maintains control of?  It's one thing to classify
       advances in technology as SECRET, but it's it quite different to
       classify non-elected government as SECRET.  When that
       nonaccountable Government (nonaccountable by reason of being
       SECRET) passes military laws that affect all branches of
       Government (military and non-military) are the laws legal or non

       Constitutional?
            "If the JMP (Justice for Military Personnel) letter is true,
       are the actions of the CIA legal as used AGAINST citizens of the
       USA?  Isn't the purpose of the CIA to protect citizens AGAINST
       foreign threats?
            "If the MIBS exist according to the documents, what has
       happened to the Conscience of the Military Personnel that carry
       out false ID missions against private citizens?  Why are Military
       Personnel carrying out higher up orders to impersonate branches

       In June of 1992, Associated Press Writer Ike Flores wrote the
       following in an article titled 'COLD FUSION MAY STIR SCIENTIFIC
       REACTION'.  One might wonder if anything will come of this
       'discovery', or if the multi-billion-dollar oil barons (whose
       very livelihoods would be threatened by such 'cheap' energy) will
       get to him first?  Some accounts state that these power-mongers
       have crushed the inventions and inventors of 'free energy'
       magnetic, etc., devices in the past, and that they might attempt
       to do so in the future:
            "ORLANDO, Fla. -- An Orlando scientist awaits the reaction
       of his colleagues worldwide to an announcement that he's
       developed a laboratory cold fusion process that can be repeated
       on demand.
            "Dr. Nelson Ying, a nuclear physicist, announced Friday that
       he is getting up to 100,000 TIMES more energy from a tabletop
       apparatus than he applies to it, and that he can repeat the
       procedure at will.
            "A workable cold fusion process -- that can be used to
       produce cheap electric power -- has been touted as a solution to
       the world's energy problems.
            "He began his work in November 1989 after two University of
       Utah chemists and others claimed to have discovered cold fusion.
            "However, scientists worldwide had spotty results to
       duplicate the work of the chemists Stanley Pons and Martin
       Fleischmann.  Even those that did obtain positive results had
       difficulty repeating the process, and no one has been able to
       obtain cold fusion on demand.
            "But Ying's announcement may reopen the controversy over
       similar claims that have never been fully substantiated.
            "'We are sure we have obtained cold fusion which we can
       initiate on demand,' Ying announced at a news conference after a
       demonstration at the Orlando Science Center.
            "'This is subject, of course, to the rigorous review of my
       peers,' added Ying, who is an adjunct professor at the University
       of Central Florida and president of Quantum Nucleonics Corp, of
       Orlando.
            "He said he and a co-worker, Charles W. Shults III,
       developed the process over the past three years and have
       conducted 102 successful experiments.
            "'We are able to get much more heat than we put in,
       repeatedly,' Ying said after the demonstration observed by U.S.
       Rep. George E. Brown Jr., D-Calif., chairman of the House
       Science, Space and Technology Committee.
            "Brown and U.S. Rep. Jim Bacchus of Orlando, a member of the

                                      Page 6





       committee, said they were hopeful that Ying's process could be
       scientifically proved.
            "'I will probably assign some of our best staff people to
       this right away,' said Brown, who was surprised by the disclosure
       while on a visit to Orlando with Bacchus."
