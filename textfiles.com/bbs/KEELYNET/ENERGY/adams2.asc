                       Adams Breaks the Gravity Barrier

Inventor Robert Adams appears to have broken the gravity barrier, with his
advanced Adams Electric Motor Generator operating in a high state of resonance
and apparently tapping gravitational energy.

"During the later months of 1992, I derived what I considered to be an
equation for possibly the ultimate in rotary motor generator design.  The
purpose of this exercise, was to ascertain whether further unconventional
design features of the machine parameters, using this equation, proved certain
theories which I had previously discussed with Mr. Bruce Cathie, an
internationally recognized New Zealand researcher in this field.  (Cathie is
the 'father' of grid harmonics)

Upon applying the 'equation' to the machine parameters and testing it, there
was no doubt the machine was running in a higher state of resonance than
previously obtained.

It had been arranged beforehand between myself and Mr. Cathie that, should the
results of this test be of some substance, Mr. Cathie would travel from
Auckland to Whakatane specifically to check the machine parameters with his
'harmonic equations'.  These results confirmed the theory which we had
previously discussed and planned to implement.

The results of these first trial tests have been SUPERCEDED, with the new
figures obtained being found beyond anything that is known of in the present-
day field of free energy research.  There is every possibility that these
latest figures, also, will be surpassed in the near future.

The equations and how they are applied are hidden within certain parameters,
and, to this end, it could be said that to reach the ultimate in rotary over-
unity devices is not possible without the correct application to all
parameters of the machine using the 'Adams Pulse Method' and the Adams-Cathie
equations.

The above methods and results give us a valuable lead in the realm of solid-
state gravitational energy research.  The equations and methods of application
in design procedures, however, remain, at this stage, secret.  The efficiency
figures possible from the device are such that they simply cannot be
published.

I wish readers to refer further to the following discussions on Wilhelm Muller
and Dr. Rolf Schaffranke, the general content of which relates to my discovery
of the mysteries of magnetism some twenty-four years ago."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Adams Pulsed Electric Motor Generator:

On Wilhelm Muller

"Reference to an article authored by Tom Valentine, California based freelance
journalist, in regard to claims by Wilhelm Muller and his magnet
manufacturers.

I must take Muller and his magnet manufacturers to task on their statement
that "magnets can do a tremendous amount of work" - this is not so.

In an over-unity rotary machine, the magnets are 'assisting' to run the
machine, but they are not generating the extra energy beyond the reaching of
100% efficiency.  The magnets are not doing actual work, as such, beyond that
point.

It is likely Muller's machine is operating, according to the efficiency figure
Muller quoted, somewhere on the near lower end of a positive resonance curve.
From the generally known information on his device, this would be the likely
area in which it is operating.  If this is so, then the chances of greater
efficiency are slim, particularly on account of it appearing to be operating
in a positive mode.  For the rotor magnets to operate as a gate to harness
gravitational energy beyond unity, it must be in a negatively resonant mode
and not operating in a closed magnetic circuit system.

Bruce Cathie and I spent an entire day together in January 1993 going over his
harmonic equations in regard to my advanced machine, and confirmed that it was
running in an advanced state of resonance, harnessing gravitational energy and
demonstrating evidence of the magnets forming a 'gate' to harness one half-
cycle of the gravitational pulse, but doing no actual work over and above the
100%.

In regard to another claim by Muller that he had to use powerful neodymium
magnets, this also is contrary to our findings.  It matters not whether you
use standard off-the-shelf 'alnico' magnets or powerful magnets, the results
are no different.  It is not necessary to use powerful magnets to prove if a
machine can be constructed with over unity capability.  This fact has been
shown repeatedly with the Adams machines, using small and weak magnets.

The inference also that Nikola Tesla might have required today's advanced
magnetic materials to achieve over unity results, is also totally wrong.  The
only difference between using ordinary magnets like 'alnico' and, for
instance, 'samarium cobalt', is that you get greater energy output from the
stronger magnets by way of their ability to detect and amplify this energy on
a greater scale; and, therefore, upon utilizing the Adams pulsing system, you
can have a device using any ordinary magnets capable of not only 100%
efficiency, but also of being tuned into operating as a gate in detecting and
delivering gravitational energy.

As for the establishment's texts stating that "magnets do NO real work", the
establishment, for once, is correct.  It is, however, interesting to note that
this is a very 'convenient' fact for the establishment to expound upon - there
could be an underlying inference here that magnets are useless for machines
designed to achieve beyond unity results.

Permanent magnets and their place in science today need to be more fully
understood."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
On Dr. Rolf Schaffranke

"Reference to an article written by Dr. Schaffranke in THE MANUAL OF FREE
ENERGY DEVICES AND SYSTEMS, VOLUME TWO, published by D.A.  Kelly, in which on
page 7, paragraphs 7 and 12, Dr. Schaffranke erroneously maintains it is
NECESSARY to use super magnets to tap gravitational energy.

I found that my original 1970 open magnetic circuit motor generator is
superior to my 1976 closed magnetic circuit model in regard to the results of
obtaining and maintaining a correct harmonic vacuum oscillation and so tapping
gravitational energy during one half-cycle of the gravitational pulse wave.

People who make such claims regarding the use of super magnets, obviously have
little or no experience in the realms of rotary free-energy devices using
permanent magnets.  Over twenty years ago, I proved that even tiny weak
magnets bought off the shelf and incorporated into my machines yielded
efficiency into the hundreds of per cent over unity.

A permanent magnet is an entity unto itself.  It is no different in any way
whatsoever from its brothers made of different materials; it is still a
permanent magnet irrespective of its gauss rating.

These claims are tantamount to saying that you can get more than 2.2 volts out
of a lead acid cell simply by increasing its ampere hour rating, or
conversely, you use a ten horsepower motor to run a machine that only requires
one horsepower.

I reiterate - the sooner science rejects conventionalism, the better for
humankind.

If indeed magnets were doing a tremendous amount of work, they certainly would
not last long in any machine.  There are secrets and mysteries surrounding
magnets and collapsing field energies, and only after exhaustive studies of
these two phenomena in practice, do these mysteries unravel themselves and
emerge in their glory, and, correctly applied through the use of the required
mathematics, pave the way to tapping gravitational energy in astronomical
quantity.

For high-power rotary machines, however, super magnets are the obvious choice,
for reasons of higher power capabilities, reduced weight and volume.  When
installed in an 'Adams' machine, these super magnets enable the opening up of
clearances between rotor and stator without appreciable loss due to the high
overall efficiency of this machine.

If indeed it were possible to induce magnets to do a tremendous amount of
work, as claimed by the aforementioned people, then I claim that the magnets
must first have very substantial energy imparted to them to undertake the task
ahead.  Secondly, when reaching this 'tremendous' state, they would start
heating up and continue to do so until they reach the point whereby their
magnetism would begin disintegrating, and continue to do so until the machine
would eventually come to a halt, unable to start again.

There are a lot of people out there striving for the ultimate in rotary
electrical machines.  They all have my personal blessings for their
endeavours, but may I hasten to add for those who make such claims, that they
exhibit a lack of experience and knowledge of the capabilities of permanent
magnets in rotary electrical machines.

But don't be disappointed, readers, as I assure you that permanent magnets are
indeed the answer to free energy.  Correctly adapted to a rotary machine they
are the 'gateway' to harnessing gravitational energy.

With the application of the 'Adams resonant pulse frequency equation' and the
'Cathie harmonic equations' combined with the 'Adams Pulsed EMG System',
incredible energies can be very easily and cleanly made available.

I wish to state to all readers at this particular stage, that I have only, in
the past year, made the decision to publish certain aspects from my twenty
years work in the field of free energy research.

There are no doubt many other researchers who, for various reasons such as
lack of finance, fear, suppression and very many other barriers, have not had
even a chance to be heard.  It is to be hoped the day will soon arrive when
all can benefit from our work."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
           The Adams Pulsed Electric Motor Generator - January 1993

"An explanation to readers on matters pertaining to hysteresis loss, eddy
current loss, magnetic drag.  Also some advice regarding further information
required from enquiries received to date by interested parties :

I would first like to state that it has been made clear that this machine has
been proven to be capable of over-unity performance, plus the fact that it has
proven itself capable of returning energy to its supply source.  So we now
come to the matters mentioned above.

If a machine is to run at unity or better, it must first 'overcome' those
problems found in the conventional machine, which, of course, are principally
those of magnetic drag, hysteresis loss and eddy currents, all of which waste
energy in heat and hence require a cooling fan - with its attendant losses as
well.

As explained previously, the Adams machine runs cool in comparison to the
conventional machine and does not, therefore, require a cooling fan.  Now
these factors surely speak for themselves.  It must also be borne in mind by
the reader that in the conventional AC or DC machine, the internal heat of
windings and stators reach boiling point within fifteen minutes.  The Adams
machine does not have this problem.

Given thse salient factors, which in themselves are a starting point for those
of you who are forward-thinking, I feel I have provided sufficient hints,
information and guidance to enable those astute enough to realize the
potentiality of the principles given, to build a machine for themselves
according to their own leanings as well as along the lines of the Adams
machine.

Most of you know of the manual which has been published and distributed by
NEXUS Magazine.  My purpose in compiling this manual is to give those
interested an insight into the principles of the mysteries of my machine, and
I expect those interested, patient and persevering enough to accept that they
must work out and work with these mysteries and to, like myself, to battle to
get there.  Only then will true understanding and enlightenment reveal itself
and true reward, however slowly, be theirs.

Notwithstanding these statements however, I submit here a few further valuable
recommendations for readers, and as time progresses, and as time permits, some
further such tidbits of information will be drip-fed through NEXUS as a form
of encouragement to all concerned.

I would like to inform readers at this point in time that, because of the
steady flow of response I have had since publication in NEXUS, by enthusiasts,
interested parties and investors alike, it is no longer possible to address
enquiries of the nature of those above individually, other than on a
consultancy basis.  Although I will continue to contribute certain articles to
NEXUS as long as I am able, and will continue to personally reply to all mail,
I ask readers to kindly understand that a good deal of my time is involved in
consultancy already on my advanced projects, so my free time is somewhat
limited.  I encourage readers to keep their eyes on NEXUS as I intend to
remain as loyal to them as they are to me.

Here, then, are those few further recommendations to readers.

If contemplating the construction of a proving machine - note as follows :

1)  Don't purchase expensive powerful 'neodymium' or 'samarium cobalt' magnets
    without first having experience with cheap easy-to-get 'alnico' magnets,
    for if you commence with powerful magnets you will find yourself facing
    powerful problems.  More information on this matter of 'powerful magnets'
    will be found in the article referred to as "The Adams 1992-1993 Christmas
    New Year breakthrough" (refer to NEXUS - VOLUME 2, NO.11 - see ADAMS1.ZIP
    on KeelyNet) and in the article written by the inventor referred to as "On
    Wilhelm Muller" (dated 1 February 1993).  Using powerful magnets will not
    prove anything beyond what alnico will do.  However, given this, if you
    feel you MUST choose powerful magnets, for whatever your reasons, take
    heed -great care is required in the handling of them to preclude personal
    injury.
2)  For a proving machine do not use less than 10 ohms each for two stators at
    180 degrees apart; recommend series mode for first attempt.  Don't be
    concerned about start windings initially and, remember, what can be
    achieved MICROscopically can be achieved MACROscopically and so I strongly
    suggest - walk before you run.
3)  Should you experience any difficulty in designing and constructing the
    tapered disc contactor (machining, etc.) then use electronic switching,
    i.e. photo, Hall effect, or inductor effect, with switching current
    transistor, etc.  The machine, correctly constructed, should still deliver
    a minimum 107% efficiency.  The charging effect will, of course, be lost,
    and the input current to supply the electronic switching will raise the
    total input quite steeply.  The point to be made here is that in using
    electronic switching, in a larger machine, the degree of loss due to this
    use of electronic switching is negligible.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, for those who are seeking greater efficiency figures, it is advised
to stay with the tapered disc contactor method and build a small wattage unit,
i.e. 0.25 to 1 watt.  This is the area of power rating within which you will
gain quicker and better results which, in turn, will provide the necessary
experience for designing and building a larger unit.

Once again the inventor cannot stress the importance enough, for those who
wish to construct a successful device, to start at the bottom rung and listen
to what the device is saying to you as you go along.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note for the Curious

I have received a lot of requests regarding an explanation accounting for such
low temperature operation on full load.  This one fact alone is indisputable
evidence of a very high efficiency rating.

I have therefore decided to make up a set of drawings which will explain to
the reader the questions regarding hysteresis, eddy current and magnetic drag
losses, as well as temperature ratings, etc.

These drawings will be accompanied with written explanations concerning the
'how'and 'why' of certain factors.

These drawings and their accompanying information will be available directly
from the inventor at the address given below at a cost of NZ $20.00 including
postage.

Meanwhile, for further information on the 'Adams and Cathie' projects, you'll
find it all in your future issues of NEXUS."

Vangard notes

   The Adams machine was quite the topic of discussion at the April 1993 ISNE
   conference in Denver.  It was first broken to the public attention by NEXUS
   magazine, published in Australia.

   We have had contact with Duncan Roads, editor of NEXUS, for about two years
   now and they have used several of our files as source material or verbatim
   from the board.

   NEXUS covers a broad range of topics and always has several interesting
   articles that make it worth subscribing to.  And Duncan also believes that
   information should be as freely shared as possible, and so recommends that
   folks copy and pass around information from NEXUS, just as KeelyNet, now in
   its 4th year, has done from day one.

   As to the ADAMS motor, I am a bit puzzled with the comments that
   gravitational energy is somehow used in the machine.  From my admittedly
   limited understanding, it simply appears that he is using the back EMF to
   give additional thrust and thus a much higher efficiency.

   With the use of the back EMF, there would be little if any hysteresis from
   the "collision" of the forward EMF with the back EMF and thus the reduction
   in heating.

   We at KeelyNet would greatly appreciate reports from anyone reading this
   who might choose to build or otherwise experiment with the principle.  You
   may upload as a text file or send a photo copy to the Vanguard Sciences
   address at the top of the document.  Thanks....>>>  Jerry
