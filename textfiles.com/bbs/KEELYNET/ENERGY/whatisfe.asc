                              WHAT IS FREE ENERGY
                                 by D.A. KELLY
            (taken from The Manual of Free Energy  Systems Vol. II)

The term " free energy"' , is considered to be the net EMF yield, or energy
differential between the input to an electromagnetic unit or system and the
output EMF  produced by it.

Some electromagnetic machines produce an output "slightly" above unity, while
others have produced outputs of about three-to-one. Lately, the output ratios
have been rising, with a recent unit providing about five-to-one, The
prospects are quite good for a continuing and steady increase in these
input/output ratios.

The concept of electromagnetic "free energy" should not be considered to be
the same as natural free energy sources such as solar-wind, hyrdo or
geothermal energies, because these new E/M machines usually require an input
energy in order to obtain an increased energy output, which the natural
sources do not require.

Several years ago there were only a few ""free energy"" devices which appeared
to offer hopeful opportunities for development, but today there are AT LEAST
FIVE significant individual projects which are operating at varying degrees of
over-unity output.

While these various machines or devices in both rotating and solid state
classes are based on classic Faraday/Maxwell principles, they achieve their
over-unity output by the ENHANCED ELECTROMAGNETIC ACTIVITY WITHIN THE UNIT
or system.

It must be noted that some senior physicists, in an attempt to discredit some
free energy researcher's projects are proposing the discarding of Maxwell's
mathematics with their new theories and operating machines.  After a thorough
review of each researchers work it was found that rather than the discarding
of Maxwell's equation principles, these various machines actually supplement
or enhance the electromagnetic functioning in each case, based on Maxwell's
Second equation.

Since this attempted discrediting has occurred in two distinct cases it
appears to be a planned and contrived approach to putting down "free energy"
efforts.

One of the major reasons that establishment physicists resist the Concept of
"free energy" is that the tachyon field concept goes against the Special
Theory of Relativity which limits particle speeds to the speed of light. The
tachyon concept (fast particles) has been proven valid based on the findings
of Professor Gerald Feinberg at Columbia University in 1967.  Several of these
new over-unity output machines have established the reality of the tachyon
field as witnessed by the individual researchers.

In addition to Professor Feinberg's findings on the fast particle concept, a
U.S. Naval research team which was running various experiments during the
1950's recorded a spot indicator moving across a CRT scope screen at a speed
of 202,000 miles per second, which could not be explained. These tests results
were noted as the interaction of particles moving at about 16,000 mites per
second.

Aware of the constant of 186,000 speed of light standard, these experimenters
rechecked their test setup, but again recorded the same results of the 202,000
mps particle speed. Since none could offer an explanation of these findings,
the test results just went into limbo and were noted as an unexplained
phenomena.

The result of the "Saganac Experiment" in 1913, also has never been
satisfactorily explained by contemporary physicists. In this experiment two
simultaneous light sources were sent in opposite directions around a closed
path, and photographic plates recorded the impingement of the light sources.

If the basic beliefs of relativity "were correct" both light signals would
have traveled these equal closed, circular paths (equal to the distance around
the earth's surface) in identical times. The results disclosed that they did
..not! We must conclude that a modification to Special Relativity is needed!
