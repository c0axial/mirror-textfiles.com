                        Our Ref:  ***********

       Dear Mr. **********,

             After we spoke over the telephone today, I received a letter
       from my client, William Hyde, in response to your letter of ********
       **, 1991.
             Mr. Hyde has asked me to convey to you his willingness to
       grant a non-exclusive license under the captioned patent for $5.5
       million plus two dollars per device manufactured.  Mr. Hyde's
       instructions are that this proposal is not negotiable.
             If your people wish to pursue this matter, please get back to
       me.  If not; and on behalf of Mr. Hyde, thank you for your
       interest.

                                                         Sincerely,
                                                         Ronald D. Cohn
