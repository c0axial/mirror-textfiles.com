              This file courtesy of Double Helix BBS at 212 865 7043.

          This is a short paper on my (author) own view of the universe.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

           The universe,  as  we  know  at the present time, is composed of
       many units ranging in size, for  as  far  as  we  can  tell,  from -
       infinity to +infinity.

           Units like galaxies and clusters of galaxies  are  some  of  the
       larger units we  know  of.  Towards the smaller end of our knowledge
       are the atoms,  made up of protons,  neutrons,  and  electrons,  and
       interacting with countless  other  particles  such   as   neutrinos,
       mesons, and baryons.   Most of these particles are even smaller than
       any of the components of the atom.

           In fact the only limitation to the size of the particles we find
       seems to be  in  the resolving power  of  our  instruments  and  the
       Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

           This seemingly endless range of universal units leads us to ask,
       "What is the universe made of?", "Is there any really  basic element
       that composes all  that  we  know as the universe?". These questions
       will be extremely hard if not impossible to answer.

           My idea  of  the universe is quite  simple,  particles  ARE  NOT
       particles at all.   Einstein  gave us the theory of  relativity  and
       gave us the  idea  that  one of the basic forces of nature; gravity;
       can be explained as the curvature of spacetime around an object.

           Well, what if the object, be it  a  planet or a Quark, is not an
       object at all but simply a "bump" in spacetime?  Then  the curvature
       of spacetime is  no  longer  around  that object, it IS that object.
       (from a Keely  viewpoint,  this "bump"  is  a  NODE  generated  from
       interference patterns in the AETHER.....VANGARD)

           What if  all  the units in the universe are composed  of  simple
       distortions in the spacetime continuum?

           All universal  units have charge, but the most charged in either
       direction are the subatomic particles.

           Well, what if these charged particles  were  simply  vortexes in
       spacetime, the size of this vortex being proportional to the mass of

                                      Page 1





       the particle, spinning  clockwise  or  counterclockwise depending on
       the charge?  (refer  to  the  work  of  VICTOR  SCHAUBERGER,  Walter
       Baumgartner, Walter Russell, John W. Keely)

           This would allow for attraction between two vortexes spinning in
       opposite directions (opposite   charges  attract),   and   repulsion
       between vortexes spinning   in  the  same  direction  (like  charges
       repel).  Well, what  about the fact  that  these  particles  CAN  be
       broken down into other particles?

            Not a problem when you consider the behavior of  eddys.  When a
       spinning eddy is  disrupted  by  some  other  object  or  eddy  in a
       specific way, IT BREAKS UP into smaller  swirling  eddys,  hence new
       particles are created.   (destructive  interference  and  parametric
       resonances.....VANGARD)

           Magnetism can  also  be  explained if you consider the fact that
       many vortexes spinning in the same  direction,  will cause a general
       flow of fluid or spacetime or whatever to flow around them.

           Larger units like planets need not be single huge  vortexes, but
       may simply be  MADE  UP OF MANY SMALLER VORTEXES, I'd even go as far
       as to say that THE NUCLEUS OF THE  ATOM  is  made  up  of  different
       vortexes.  (Keely says  these vortexes occur in multiples  of  three
       throughout all mass and energy manifestations....VANGARD)

           Maybe in  the  atom  there  are  vortexes  spinning in different
       directions, not just the positive  direction  (the  protons),  maybe
       these other vortexes  cancel  out the power of some  of  the  proton
       vortexes thus making them "neutrons".

           Very much  like  the  proton  in  every  aspect  except size and
       charge, neutrons are just a little  heavier  than  the protons, this
       difference is about the weight of two electrons.

           I'm still thinking about this theory, I don't know enough to try
       to prove it or even to know whether I missed something  or  not. I'm
       still thinking about  this  theory and the nuclear forces but I like
       this idea and there doesn't seem  to  be  anything  wrong with it so
       I'll keep thinking about it.
