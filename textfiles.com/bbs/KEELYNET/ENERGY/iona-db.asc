                 THE DIAMOND BODY: BUCKMINSTER FULLER & THE QABALA
                             by Iona R. Miller, c1992


       IO [I/O] is  the  cry  of  the  lower  as OI [O/I] of the higher. In
       figures they are 1001, in letters  they  are  Joy.   For when all is
       equilibrated, when all is beheld without all, there is joy, joy, joy
       that is but  one  facet of a diamond, every other facet  whereof  is
       more joyful than joy itself.

       SACRED GEOMETRY:

       According to most  creation  stories, out of primal Nothingness, the
       All or Everything   emerges  or  emanates   forth.    Paradoxically,
       everything seems to  come  from  nothing.  How does  nothing  become
       something?

       Energy "crystallizes" into  matter  in  the  womb  of empty space, a
       dynamic Void.  Mass is simply a form  of  energy.   This  process is
       structured by an   underlying,   invisible,   geometrical   lattice.
       Actually, it is  pre-geometric.   Because  it  has  no true physical
       existence, it is metaphysical (beyond  physics).  This  threshold of
       matter, where nothing  becomes something, is of great  philosophical
       interest.

       Actually, materialism (a   natural   philosophy)   is  a  theory  of
       metaphysics.  It is metaphysical thinking  to consider static matter
       as a primary  reality. In fact, any attempt to describe  reality  is
       metaphysical speculation. In  its  dynamic  form  matter  cannot  be
       separated from energy.

       Energy is a property of matter, which  can  be  considered potential
       energy. The mystic believes in matter, but believes  it is more than
       science has yet  discovered.   Even  before  Western  science began,
       mystics believed that mind, consciousness,  or  spirit is a property
       of matter. It hardly matters, philosophically, if you consider it as
       manifesting force or manifesting spirit.

       The nature of reality is that matter-energy must be taken together.
       The theory of  relativity  conceives  of  this single substance as a
       distortion of the structure of space.  Physicist Ian Barbour writes
       that,

            "...in quantum theory, separate  particles seem to be temporary
             and partial manifestations of a shifting pattern of waves that
             combine at one point, dissolve again, and recombine elsewhere;
             a particle  begins  to  look  like  a local outcropping  of  a
             continuous substratum of vibrational energy."

       That vibrational energy is governed by the laws of probability.

       But what subtle  forces  underlie matter-energy and space-time?  All
       form and power are latent within the void.  The Heart Sutra tells us
       that, "Form is not other than Void,   Void  is not other than Form."
       This implies that  our  human  form  is  not other  than  void,  and
       biophysics shows this to be true.

       Our physical makeup  is largely emptiness. If we conceive  of humans
       as being most  fundamentally electromagnetic  entities,  instead  of
       chemical beings, we can imagine our finer existence  as  wave-fronts
       in space. Our  personal  "space" is not utterly empty, but cannot be
       conceived apart from  our matter  exhibiting  itself  in  particular
       ways, i.e. as "waves."

       Yet, the void  state,  or  primal  matrix,  is  "cosmic  zero,"  and
       proportionately our most  fundamental  reality.   It  is part of the
       surrealistic quantum realm. It lies within us all, for the relative
       space between our atoms is astronomical.   This  is the ground state
       of existence which mystics seek in their meditation,  moving  beyond
       mind and maya.   It  is  that  state  of  consciousness  where outer
       perceptions cease, and consciousness is free to simply be.

       Throughout the centuries,  various   geometrical   forms  have  been
       revered as expressions  or  metaphors  of  higher spiritual  truths.
       These sacred forms  and symbols are a natural part of the collective
       consciousness which emerges in every  generation.   We  project them
       outwardly from within our psyche because they are so  fundamental to
       our existence.  That  apprehension  is  intuitive.  Certain  typical
       forms recur in meditation and ceremonial practice, worldwide.

       When something emerges from nothing, it does so via non-Euclidean
       geometry, coming to occupy space/time.  Einstein used non-Euclidean
       geometry to explain the relativity of time and space as the geometry
       that is produced by matter or matter by geometry.  The perception of
       the transcendental or metaphysical aspects of geometry is intuitive.
       There are examples   of  philosophical   geometry   or   geometrical
       philosophy from around  the world.  These traditions  are  found  in
       India, China, Egypt, and Great Britain, to name a few.

       Plato, Archimedes, and   the   Pythagoreans   based  much  of  their
       philosophical speculation around  the  nature  of  geometrical form,
       suggesting that mathematics  and  structural  forms   had   ultimate
       status.

       Our modern science has never forsaken the tradition of seeking the
       understanding of forms that provide shape and meaning to physical
       reality.  Euclidean geometry describes the nature of the human

                                      Page 2





       scale, but non-Euclidean  models the cosmos and microcosm.  More and
       more intricate forms  of  measurement   became   the  basis  of  the
       scientific method.  Eventually,  this  led  to modern  topology--the
       study of those  properties of geometric figures or solid bodies that
       remain invariant under certain transformations.

       Heisenberg explained that,  "The   elementary  particles  of  modern
       physics can be  transformed  into  each  other  exactly  as  in  the
       philosophy of Plato."   In  "sacred topology", the relationships are
       more than metaphorical. Metaphysical and physical reality coincide.

       This is abundantly   illustrated    in   R.   Buckminster   Fuller's
       geometrical tour de force, SYNERGETICS I & II. Fuller  demonstrates,
       via synergetics, that  the  whole  is  greater  than  the sum of its
       parts, because of the relativity of forces.

       In our universe,  as  more  complex   systems   are  built  up,  new
       properties appear that  were  not foreshadowed by the  parts  alone.
       These emergent properties  include  life,  conscious  awareness, and
       beauty.

       Plato's Academy in Athens had a  policy:  "You  are  not  allowed to
       enter here, unless you know geometry." In the dialogue,  Meno, Plato
       describes Socrates teaching  geometry  to a slave.  In true Socratic
       form, he does  not  instruct  him   directly.   Rather,  he  elicits
       knowledge from the  slave which he did not know he  possessed.   The
       diagrams themselves elicit the buried intuitive knowledge of a world
       inhabited by the gods and by the divine "Forms."

       In Plato's view,   before   birth   we  were  familiar  with  purely
       mathematical "objects" and relations,  as  well  as  moral ideals or
       values.  He alleged that we lost this knowledge at  birth,  but  can
       recover it through  revelation.   For  Plato,  the  virtues paled in
       comparison with the highest capacity  of  the  soul,  which  is  the
       mystical beholding of the eternal.  Mystics tell  us  the  divine is
       formless.

       Actual space is  not  empty,  but  the possibility has always been a
       controversial problem in philosophy.  Aristotle found the concept of
       a total void unacceptable. Scientists  still  cannot  make a perfect
       experimental vacuum.  Astronomy  shows us that matter  is  averagely
       distributed, with roughly  as much matter between the stars as there
       is within them. Yet, there are large  voids  in  space,  with  stars
       clustered on the  outer  edges  of  these  bubbles   of  void.   The
       preponderance is of volumes of empty space over volumes of matter.

       So, the characteristic  feature  of  the universe is not matter, but
       empty space. Again, most of the interior of the atom is empty, as is
       the space occupied  by the galaxies,  and  the  vast  regions  which
       separate them. Stars, atoms, and the vacuum are a seamless whole.

       The notion of the eternal nature of sacred emptiness  is  echoed  in
       modern quantum theory.   This  is  not  ordinary,  but  dynamic  and
       receptive emptiness.  The central concept in Quantum Field Theory is
       that of the field, which exists everywhere  and  everywhen.  It is a
       field of curved  space/time.   Matter  is  not  separate   from  its
       surrounding space.  The  field  can  take  the  form  of  quanta  or
       particles.  It is the fundamental physical entity, the only physical
       reality.

                                      Page 3





       The field contains  the  potentiality  of  all  possible  states  or
       conditions in the universe.  Of these  states,  the most fundamental
       is the Ground State, (or "vacuum  state").  Matter  is  rare  in the
       universe.  Most of  it  consists  of a very volatile, excited, ionic
       plasma.  Only 5% of matter is neither  too  hot,  nor too dilute, to
       congeal as a solid, liquid, or gas.  This form of matter  is so rare
       it has been described as 'trace contaminants.'

       Yet, some form  of  matter is essential to all activity.  All matter
       is in motion.  Activity is the essence  of  being.  From the "cosmic
       zero", everything -- the totality of "excited  states"  -- arises by
       creative processes.  It  is  also  the  state  into which everything
       subsides by absorption processes.  The ground state is characterized
       by the fact that it stretches to infinity, uniform and changeless.

       It is the same everywhere and everywhen  because  of the identity of
       space/time.  Within the  universal field the values  of  the  ground
       state and excited  states  are  all  one.   An  unlimited  amount of
       particles come into being and vanish  endlessly.   Matter  is thus a
       temporary manifestation of the Void.

       The so-called  "cosmic  zero"  was  modeled  by geometer/philosopher
       Fuller in the figure he called Vector Equilibrium, (V.E.).  It might
       actually claim to  be  the first "Buckyball," the one Fuller himself
       described.  This geometry is the  precursor  of  the  new  elemental
       'Fullerenes.' The V.E. geometry has been recognized for a long time.
       It was one of the thirteen Archimedian solids, the cuboctahedron.

       But the Greeks were fascinated with regular forms whose  faces  were
       all the same,  such  as  the  cube.   They  failed to understand the
       delicate balancing act the cuboctahedron symbolizes. They simply did
       not notice that Vector Equilibrium  is  pristine  equanimity because
       they were looking  elsewhere.  The Greeks never really  comprehended
       the energic or  energetic  properties  of  Vector  Equilibrium, i.e.
       dynamic stability.  They  had  a static,  non-relativistic  view  of
       natural philosophy.

       It remained for Fuller to assert that,

            "zero pulsation  in  the  Vector  Equilibrium  is  the  nearest
             approach we will ever know to eternity and god."

       (ABSOLUTE stillness..see Russell on the Magnetic Shaft of Stillness)

       The conceptual model is the closest our minds and senses can come to
       that cosmic realization,  short  of mystical revelation.  Mind alone
       cannot fathom the depth of this Void.   Geometry  is  a construct of
       the intellect.

       The V.E. center is primal "emptiness."  It is a mathematical anomaly
       where the normal laws of the space/time continuum break down.  It is
       not a symbol  of  ultimate  order.  It looks like a  very  rational,
       orderly system, but  it  is  ultimately irrational. It defies logic.
       V.E. is the  breeder  of  wave-particle   duality,  the  uncertainty
       principle, and non-locality at the quantum level.   It  is a zone of
       neutral resonance where   waves   can  pass  through  waves  without
       interference, according to Fuller.   Yet, it never physically exists
       as a structure, since nature abhors a vacuum.


                                      Page 4





       In  quantum mechanics  a  system can never have an energy of exactly
       zero.  There is no such thing as absolute  emptiness.   However, the
       minimal motion of the ground state is called zero point  energy,  or
       zero point motion.

       Cosmic zero exists,  paradoxically,  in the realm of the psyche (our
       conceptualization) and in quantum  reality  in  the  atomic  nucleus
       expressed as force.   It  is  the  form  of formlessness,  the  root
       metaphor. It also  forms the roots of the cosmic Tree of Life, since
       there is a fine-to-non-existent line  between  organic and inorganic
       matter on the quantum scale.

       Physics is the patterns of organic energy, all of which are dynamic,
       alive.  Mass is energy, so the subatomic world is always  restlessly
       in motion. Inert  matter  is  full of motion when we look closely at
       it.  The activity of matter is its essence.

       Vector Equilibrium emanates/condenses   from   a  center  in  twelve
       fundamental directions.  This emergent energy moves  outward through
       space/time in the  form  of  a  cuboctahedron,  alternating with its
       mathematical reciprocal, an octahedron-within-a-cube.

       It is a truncated cube with 50 symmetrically  positioned topological
       features.  Vector Equilibrium has the same surface area as a sphere,
       yet contains no volume, i.e. it contains "nothing."

       The Vector Equilibrium  system has 12 vertices, 8 triangular  faces,
       24 edges, and   32   planes.   It  is  omnidirectional  equilibrium,
       symbolically and physically speaking.   As  such,  it  is  a perfect
       symbol for "holding the tension of the opposites,"   or "uniting the
       opposites."

       Yet, it is  more  than  a metaphor.  It is an archetypal image which
       bridges the macrocosm  with the microcosm.   It  is a living example
       of the Hermetic Axiom, "As Above, So Below," uniting  spiritual  and
       literal reality.  V.E.  makes  it possible to make conceptual models
       of other dimensions (hyperspace), mathematically and mystically.

       In the V.E. figure, equilibrium between  positive  and  negative  is
       zero. It is   the   equalization   of  the  forces   of   push/pull,
       radiation/gravitation, or tension/compression.  Fuller alleged it
       "represents the limits of the mind's ability to conceptualize 'in'."

       For Fuller, all  of  space/time  is  undergird  with a pre-geometric
       matrix, which is an infinite field  of vector equilibria.  An entire
       universe can be seeded from one V.E., self-generating  to  fill  all
       space/time.  There may  be  no  ultimate  physical building-block of
       matter, but there is one single entity  that undergirds and composes
       everything in the universe, according to Fuller. The  basic  element
       of the universe is dynamic patterns.

       This  field constitutes a "cosmic blueprint" which Fuller called the
       Isotropic Vector Matrix   (I.V.M.),   a   living   continuum.    The
       allocation of divinity to this "mother  of  all  fields"  marks  its
       archetypal character.  As  a  variation  on the theme  of  Celestial
       Goddess, it symbolizes  the  embodiment  of  nature.   Like a modern
       Isis, it iterates the theme of the  underlying,  inseparable  cosmic
       web or net,  connecting  all.  The living Void gives  birth  to  all
       phenomenal forms. It pulsates with the rhythm of creation and

                                      Page 5





       destruction of material  particles.   Another  goddess, Nuit, is the
       essence of Infinite Space.  She is infinite energy density pervading
       the entire cosmos.   She is the  receptivity  of  the  void  to  the
       wavelength of radiation.   Adjusting  the  geometry   of   the  void
       influences the propagation  of  radiation.   The  goddess  Ma-at, or
       Balance, is another expression of the same universal V.E. energy.

       The Upanishads identifies Brahman with the void:

             Brahman is life. Brahman is  joy.  Brahman  is the Void.  Joy,
             verily, that is the same as the Void.  The Void,  verily, that
             is the same as joy.

       The geometry of Vector Equilibrium is inferred from that of closest-
       packed spheres of  equal radius.  It just happens to be the geometry
       which underlies all matter since it  is  found in the nucleus of all
       atoms as sub-atomic  force.   Here, in the interior  of  the  atoms,
       Newtonian physics does  not apply.  This is a probabilistic, acausal
       world. Here synchronicity prevails over chronicity.

       This uniform geometrical  field,   with   the   property  of  Divine
       consciousness, is the  basis  for  a  geometrical model  of  reality
       spanning the abyss between the metaphysical and the physical.  It is
       not the first  model  in  history  to attempt to do so.  There is an
       ancient geometrical model which shares  a  common framework with the
       Vector Equilibrium.

       THE GEOMETRY OF THE QABALA

       The ancient mystical system of the Qabala is formulated  around  the
       geometrical glyph known  as  the Tree of Life.  This sacred geometry
       system came down to us through Judaism  and Hermetic Philosophy.  It
       is one of  the  main  currents  of  thought  in the  Western  Occult
       Tradition.

       A mathematically accurate   image   of  the  Tree  of  Life  can  be
       constructed by dividing a vertical  line into four equal lengths and
       filling in four intersecting circles, using a fourth  of the line as
       radius.  The nexus  points  are the positions of the 10 spheres, and
       connecting paths join the centers of the spheres.

                                   (Add Drawing A)

       The spheres represent states of  consciousness  or  ways  of  being,
       while the paths are ways of transition or change.  It symbolizes all
       ways of being  and becoming.  Like the quantum  field,  it  contains
       the potentiality of   all  possible  states  or  conditions  in  the
       universe.  It is just the ancient way of saying it, and it turns out
       to be physically provable. The ancient  model  coincides with state-
       of-the-art physics.  The 10 spheres and 22 paths yield a total of 32
       planes of reference, like the Vector Equilibrium.

       This "tree" was  first described in writing in the Sephir  Yetzirah,
       or The Book of Formation. Legend says the book came to Abraham, from
       God, through an angel. Today, we might say it was "channeled" from a
       divine source.  Jewish  scholar,  Gershom  Scholem  dates  the  work
       around the third  to  sixth  century.    However,   there   is  some
       astronomical evidence that  the system does date from  the  time  of
       Abraham, approximately 4,000 years ago.

       Whether the patriarch  was  the  first to receive the revelation, or
       not, this archetypal consciousness map encodes a system of spiritual
       wisdom and  growth in geometrical  form.  It describes the nature of
       the universe, consciousness,  and the creation.  It  seems  to  have
       intuitively anticipated the  discovery  of  the  physical  nature of
       reality.

       The glyph itself was used as a meditation  devise by students of the
       Qabala, an oral wisdom tradition. One aim of the  qabalists  was  to
       see the Tree  always,  everywhere, in everything.  Another essential
       doctrine of Qabala is that humans  possess  a "spirit body" that can
       detach itself from the physical body and ascend to higher planes.

       Most modern students  of Qabala are familiar with  the  standard  2-
       dimensional representation of the Tree, which is drawn "flat," even
       though the circles are always conceived of as spheres. There is also
       a long tradition  of a so-called 4-dimensional Tree of Life diagram,
       based on The Book of Formation.  This geometrical figure consists of
       two interfacing pyramids  surrounding  a  central  core,  within  an
       enclosing cube.

       This octahedron-within-a-cube happens to be the crystal structure of
       diamond, a face-centered-cubic lattice. Recalling  that  Abraham  is
       also the patriarch  of  the  Moslems,  it  is  interesting  to  note
       reference to a spiritual body, a "diamond  body",  in the writing of
       Shaikh Amad Ahsa'i from the  13th century.  Speaking  of a substance
       akin to that  of  the  medieval  Philosopher's Stone, he equated the
       "diamond body" with the "Resurrection Body" of the faithful believer
       in the Paradise of the future Aeon.

       For the Qabalists, meditation on  this  figure  provided  a mystical
       body as a vehicle for consciousness in imaginal space.  This diamond
       body was used  during  meditation  to  enter  the   inner  court  of
       Divinity, symbolized by   the   center  of  the  figure.   Here  the
       Beginning and End of time are co-temporaneous,  space ceases to be a
       hindrance, and the mystic beheld the ecstatic vision  of the Lord on
       His Throne.  The  geometry  was  a "gateway" to another dimension of
       experience.

       This Alpha-Omega point has all the physical qualities of Vector
       Equilibrium.  The ancient meditation  practice was known as Merkabah
       mysticism, and those who practiced it called themselves,  "Riders in
       the Chariot."  They claimed to see into the future.  This insinuates
       that the figure  is  a  "vehicle"  for  moving consciousness through
       imaginal time and  space.  It  seems  to  be  a  metaphysical  "time
       machine," or inter-dimensional gateway.

       As in most design or mandala meditations, the aspirant  pictures him
       or herself at  the  center  of  the  figure  through  visualization,
       contemplation, and identification.    Through    this   process   of
       centering, these mystics came to know themselves and  God.   Perhaps
       they learned, as  Fuller  later discovered, of the unusual anomalous
       conditions of perfect  equilibrium.    This  meditation  provided  a
       specific technique for  escaping  from time.  Its realization  meant
       instantaneous enlightenment, a  paradoxical  leap  out  of Time.  It
       yields transcendence.

       Occultist, Paul Foster Case published  an  array of this type in his
       book, The Tarot (1947).  Aware of the ancient mystic practice, he

                                      Page 7





       included the figure  in  his study of Qabala, calling it alternately
       the Key of the Cosmos and Numbers,  or the Cube of Space.  Again, we
       have the form  of the octahedron-within-a-cube.  Vector  Equilibrium
       and the Cube  of Space are mathematical duals, or reciprocals of one
       another.  They "jitterbug"  back  and  forth  as  the  figure  grows
       outward to fill  all  space.  They are two ways of  looking  at  the
       same geometrical phenomena.

       Case pointed out  that its construction was based on the six-pointed
       Star  of David, (or Shield of David), also known as "The Star of the
       Macrocosm."  His descriptors   of   zero   as   a   sacred,   empty,
       consciousness field reiterate the qualities of Vector Equilibrium.

       Zero is a symbol of the absence of quality, quantity,  or mass. Thus
       it denotes absolute freedom from every limitation whatever.  It is a
       sign of the  infinite and eternal Conscious Energy, itself No-Thing,
       though manifest in everything. It  is  That which was, is, and shall
       be forever; but  it  is  nothing we can name.  Boundless  infinitely
       potential, living light,  it  is the rootless root of all things, of
       all activities, of all modes of consciousness.   In  it are included
       all imaginable and  unimaginable  possibilities, but  it  transcends
       them all.  The  Qabalists call it:  (a) No-Thing; (b) The Boundless;
       (c) Limitless Light.   Pure  Conscious  Energy,   above  and  beyond
       thought, to us it is Superconsciousness.

       With their fascination  for completely regular figures,  the  Greeks
       devised a way of establishing XYZ coordinates within a cube.  Our
       science and method  of  orientation  has  been stuck with that model
       ever since.  However, nature's own  most  economical coordination is
       in triangles and tetrahedra, rather than squares or  cubes.   Vector
       Equilibrium is more  in  line  with modern Quantum Mechanical models
       than the Newtonian XYZ. It expresses more degrees of freedom.

       So, close examination of the underlying geometry of the Tree of Life
       reveals that the ancients were not  lacking  a  very  deep intuitive
       awareness of the  true  structure of matter and the  universe.   The
       underlying geometrical matrix  of  the multi-dimensional Tree is, in
       fact, Vector Equilibrium. To find  the commonality -- the harmony --
       the figure of  the  V.E.  must  be  subjected  to  a  transformation
       process, i.e. rotation.

       To bring the two figures into synch, simply rotate the V.E. to any
       edge of its  containing  cube.   If  the 3-dimensional V.E. is drawn
       flat, the inherent  geometry of the  Tree  of  Life  is  immediately
       revealed, including some of the so-called "hidden" paths.

       A symbolic representation  of  the  optimal union of  opposites,  it
       means in psychological   terms,   "holding   the   tension   of  the
       opposites."  This is the essence of  the Tree of Life.  The theme of
       union of opposites has reverberated down through the  ages.   It was
       the process/goal of alchemy, creation of the Philosopher's Stone.

       Now, Jungian psychology  carries  the  torch  of  this philosophical
       pursuit.  Both Vector Equilibrium  and the Tree of Life express this
       most elegantly and   economically   in  terms  of  minimal   graphic
       elements.

       By combining the  vectors  of  a  V.E.  nested  within a cube, it is
       possible to derive the nexus points on which to construct the entire
       Tree of Life. In The Anatomy of  the  Body  of  God,  (1925), Frater
       Achad, (magickal name  of  Charles  Stansfield Jones),  revealed  an
       amplified Tree of Life projecting from a center in six directions.

       Rather than a  flat depiction, his revelation showed Trees radiating
       in the four cardinal directions, plus  up and down.  This is another
       variation on the theme of XYZ coordinates.  Yet, V.E.  can be shown,
       once again, to  be the skeletal matrix on which the figure congeals.
       The geometrical duals yield all the  necessary  nexus points to form
       the entire Tree of Life, including the 11th mystery  sphere,  Daath.
       Achad's advice for  modern  Qabalists  says,  ...since the "Tree" is
       everywhere the same  in  every  part  of  space,  once  its  general
       attributions are fixed  in  the  mind,  it is not  well  to  confuse
       ourselves by too  much  attempt at progressed expansion of the idea.
       Rather we would return and contemplate  the  Centre  from  which All
       proceeds, thus obtaining the Pure Essence Here and Now.

       This concept of   a   self-generating,   self-iterating,   all-space
       filling, crystalline system  seems to herald the modern discovery of
       the fractal nature  of  the  universe.   Whether   we  look  at  the
       macrocosmic, mesocosmic, or  microcosmic  level, we  find  the  same
       principle operating.  By  following any portion of the consciousness
       map "backwards" and "downwards" to  the center, we have a conceptual
       means of entering  that  most pristine state of consciousness  where
       All becomes No-Thing.

                                   (Add Drawing C)

                                       V.E.

       GEOMETRICAL IN-SIGHT:

       These systems are  virtually  pre-geometrical.   They  don't  really
       exist in nature, per se. Yet they are the invisible lattice, or bare
       bones, of our  physical  and  spiritual   life,   of  all  life  and
       manifestations.  In this  pre-geometry we have a blueprint  for  the
       formation of all matter, all form.  This is the geometry of closest-
       packed spheres in the nucleus of the atom.

       Yet,  Vector Equilibrium  is  more  than  an  expression  of nuclear
       forces.  It is "an endlessly interlinked  chain  of atomically self-
       renewing links  of  omni-equal  strength or of an omni-directionally
       interlinked chain matrix of ever renewed atomic links, "according to
       Fuller.  No single  configuration  of  matter persists indefinitely.
       All is change and recombination.  V.E. describes the most economical
       lines of movement within the atomic  nucleus.   And,  it also is the
       structural matrix of a very ancient and sophisticated consciousness-
       changing technology.  Through it we remember deep knowledge  of  our
       true nature.

       Noting the metaphysical  aspect of physics, physicist Wolfgang Pauli
       said,

            "We should  now  proceed  to  find  a  neutral,  or  unitarian,
             language in which every concept we use is applicable  as  well
             to the  unconscious  as  to  matter, in order to overcome this
             wrong view that the unconscious  psyche  and  matter  are  two
             things."
                                      Page 9





       We have, in  the  V.E.  model,  a  language  or information transfer
       system that bridges  both the physical  and  the  spiritual,  Fuller
       says, "In this model the physical and metaphysical  share  the  same
       design."  The mundane  and  supernatural  share the same design: "As
       Above, So Below."  It  creates a mystical  revelation  described  as
       ecstatic, blissful, joyful, transcendental.

       Goethe's Faust opens with the mage contemplating the qabalistic,
       geometric design of the Macrocosm:

                What jubilation bursts out of this sight
                Into my senses--now I feel it flowing,
                Youthful, a sacred fountain of delight,
                Through every nerve, my veins are glowing.
                Was it a god that made these symbols be
                That sooth my feverish unrest,
                Filling with joy my anxious breast,
                And with mysterious potency
                Make nature's hidden powers around me, manifest?

                Am I a god? Light grows this page--
                In these pure lines my eye can see
                Creative nature spread in front of me.
                But now I grasp the meaning of the sage:
                "The realm of spirits is not far away;
                Your mind is closed, your heart is dead.
                Rise student, bathe without dismay
                In heaven's dawn your mortal head."

       (He contemplates the symbol.)

                All weaves itself into the whole,
                Each living in the other's soul.
                How heaven's powers climb up and descend.
                Passing the golden pails from hand to hand!
                Bliss-scented, they are winging
                Through sky and earth--their singing
                Is ringing through the world.

       In Aion, psychologist  Carl Jung reiterates the identity  of  psyche
       and matter:

       Psyche cannot be  totally  different  from matter, for how otherwise
       could it move matter?  And matter cannot be alien to psyche, for how
       else could matter produce psyche?   Psyche  and  matter exist in the
       same world, and each partakes of the other, otherwise any reciprocal
       action would be impossible.

       To know ourselves is to know the nature of cosmos.   The  yogis  and
       masters tell us  that  matter  is  mind or consciousness at its most
       fundamental or gross level.  From  the  dawn  of history mankind has
       employed sacred geometries for metaphysical orientation and creating
       consciousness maps.  Most  maps  of  the  psyche imply  a  "journey"
       either to the  heights or depths of experience.  Long ago Heraclitus
       alleged, and mystic artist William Blake agreed, that the way up and
       the way down are one and the same.

       Metaphysical models usually speak of an ascent to utopian heights or
       "inner planes."  Psychological models are usually concerned with

                                      Page 10





       descents into the  subconscious depths and use subterranean imagery.
       These depths were the familiar territory  of  shamans for millennia.
       Both the occult and transpersonal psychology models  include heights
       and depths of  human  experience.  Maslow  introduced the concept of
       "peak experiences" to psychology.

       We may have the erroneous idea that  peaks,  or  heights, or "highs"
       are "good."  This  is mainly because we are enculturated  to  strive
       upward.

       This is only  one  of  a  myriad  of states of consciousness, and it
       belongs to manically   over-achieving    heroic   ego.    Negatively
       directed, this same  energy  can  produce  an  all-time  high  in  a
       sociopath or criminally insane personality, during a heinous act.

       All that is  "up"  is  not  "good";   and, all that is "down" is not
       "evil."  This misapprehension  is  the  root  of  the  notion  of  a
       spirit/matter duality, where  all matter is inherently  "evil".   In
       this belief system,  "we  exist:  therefore we are sinful." Yet, our
       heights and depths  contain  the first-hand  experiential  knowledge
       that 'we are one.'

       This old system of orientation and modeling the universe,  with  its
       ascents and descents  of  the  soul,  was  adequate  for many years.
       However, for the modern individual, with a consciousness that is not
       earth-bound, the old  hierarchical  model  is  no  longer  the  best
       metaphor.  Today we  are  not confined to the spectrum   of  reality
       dictated solely by our finite senses.

       We are directly  aware  of  physical realities ranging from the sub-
       atomic to the cosmic. Our perceptions are amplified with technology.
       New ways of seeing lead to new philosophical  perspectives.  We  can
       align our mystical worldview with physical reality.  The true nature
       of physical reality remains a mystery.  Even for physicists,  it has
       an elusive quality.   No  one  really  knows  just what a quantum, a
       photon, or an atom "really is"  or  what  it is doing when we're not
       looking at it.

       Physics is another interpretation of reality.  We have  become aware
       of a vast  physical  dimension  without and an equally vast realm of
       psyche within.  They are available  for  exploration.  And there are
       ancient and modern  technologies  which aid us here.   In  terms  of
       modern orientation and   consciousness  models,  an  omnidirectional
       system allows more  degrees  of   freedom.    This   freedom   is  a
       conceptual, imaginal, and physical reality.

       Buckminster Fuller said  that  in whole systems the  directions  are
       always out and  in.  "In and out are the relevant directions, not up
       and down."  Models or maps based  on  "in  and out", rather than "up
       and down", allow us to conceive of particular states  or conditions.
       As a metaphor, "in and out" is a typical characteristic of the phase
       states of matter.    It   is   either   in   or   out  of  phase  or
       synchronization.  During observation,  matter  is  either  in  solid
       physical existence (particle)  or  out  of solid physical  existence
       (wave).

       This wave-particle duality  exists  within us all.  This uncertainty
       surrounding substantive existence leads to paradox.  We cannot grasp
       one part of nature without another part slipping through our

                                      Page 11





       fingers.  Photons, neutrons,  and  even  atoms have no definite form
       until they are measured.  Wave-particle duality is a mystery.

       However, this primal  characteristic   of   atoms,  and  the  energy
       exchange in their  cores,  is  the basis of our physical  existence.
       The emergence of stable matter requires  the balancing of tendencies
       toward implosion and  explosion.   This  is  the  function of Vector
       Equilibrium.

       Physicist David Bohm modeled an "in  and  out" universe of implicate
       (in) and explicate  (out)  order.  Yogis focus on  the  in  and  out
       breath during pranayama,  and  the  experience  connects  them  with
       cosmic time.  The   psychological   tendencies,   introversion   and
       extroversion, express the polarity in ways of being.  In cybernetics
       there is input  (I)  and  output (O), the direction  of  the  signal
       determining if it is I/O or O/I.

       Vector Equilibrium is  the  most  economical model using geometry to
       express the ultimate  union  of   the   opposites.  It  creates  the
       paradoxical state that is neither in nor out, up nor  down,  neither
       this nor that.

       For Fuller, the  balancing  of  the  tension  of  the  opposites was
       achieved in his tensegrity sphere.   It is stabilized dynamically to
       neither explode nor  collapse.   This  original  "Buckyball"   is  a
       tangible example of Vector Equilibrium.

       According to Fuller,  "matter"  itself is a contained explosion, and
       the Vector Equilibrium is its austere  image.   It is a system not a
       structure.  It underlies  structure or formation of  something  from
       apparent "nothingness."

       Vector Equilibrium is  the  lattice  or invisible framework, and its
       blueprint is the cuboctahedron.   Its  explicit  form  can enfold on
       itself until it   compacts   down   into  an  octahedron,   then   a
       tetrahedron, the prime  geometrical  form.   This is accomplished by
       doubling up on  the  vectors  on   the   edges.   This  creates  the
       difference, for example, between carbon, diamond, and silicon atomic
       structures.  They are    all    face-centered    cubic     crystals.
       Coincidentally these elements  are  symbolic  icons  in our culture.
       They are the hallmarks of technology.

       A simple way  to visualize the Vector  Equilibrium  is  through  the
       closest packing of spheres which underlies the geometry  of  crystal
       formation.

       Imagine a cluster  of  ping  pong balls glued together, 12 around 1,
       then building out  further  and further.   If  you  imagine  vectors
       connecting the centers of each ball, IN THE THIRD LAYER you can find
       the Vector Equilibrium.

       The vectors that radiate out from the center are  exactly  equal  to
       the vectors that  bond  the faces.  No other structure can make this
       claim.  This is the symmetry the  Greeks  missed,   because it is an
       energetic process, manifesting force, not a thing.

       Vectors are not points in space traveling through time.  Vectors map
       energy events.  Time determines a vector's length  --  the  time  it
       takes an energy event to happen.  There must be time for wave

                                      Page 12





       functions to propagate.  We  know  a  musical  note requires time to
       exist,  because a note is nothing in an instant.

       Time is a duration.  If we ask ourselves  "a  duration of what?", we
       can only answer "...of nothing, or something."  All "somethings" are
       composed of matter,  and the nature of matter is consciousness.   So
       time becomes a  duration  of  consciousness.    Energy is substance.
       Substance is energy at the quantum  level.  Our substance is energy,
       and consciousness is fully capable of quantum leaps.

       Fuller's energy mapping  uses energetic triangles,  in  which  three
       lines are not  just  lying there but are busy stabilizing the angles
       opposite them.  Fuller describes the  dynamic domain of "reality" as
       a broad spectrum of energy events, across a small portion  of  which
       our senses can "tune."

       Vector Equilibrium allows  us  to  conceptually, metaphorically, and
       spiritually bridge the abyss between  the  mystical  and  scientific
       perspectives through sacred geometry.  It is a key  to the implicate
       and explicate order.
