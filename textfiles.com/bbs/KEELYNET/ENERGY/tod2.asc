       Dear Jerry,

       The enclosed copy is to keep you up-to-date on my activities with
       regard to the capture of 'space energy'.

       I started my work on the Bearden switching circuit in order to be
       prepared when the critical semiconductor material is made available.
       By much trial and error, my discovery, not invention, is only a
       small introduction.

       The content of the enclosed contains important correction and update
       of my earlier releases.

       Please call if there is any question or you would like an updated
       complete copy of the circuit and description.

       Sincerely,

       Hal Fox, Editor
       New Energy News
       P.O. Box 58639
       Salt Lake City, UT 84158

       Dear Mr. Fox,

       Thanks to the advice of Dan Davidson, I recently went to Santa Maria
       and met Walt Rosenthal.  I have personally experienced the quality
       of this man's experience and his reputation for being the final
       authority on electrical and electronic measurements.  With his
       modern  and  high-tech  equipment,  he  patiently  and  meticulously
       checked every point of data on my version of Bearden's theoretical
       switching circuit.  (See "Current News on Current Gain", New Energy
       News, Feb. '94,  p.15.)
                                      Page 1




       Every one of his measurements validated my data.  In conclusion,
       however,  the circuit effects a large current gain but there was no
       power  gain.    Walt's  current  probes  and  high  resolution  test
       equipment were able to measure the input power during the short
       pulse of the primary circuit.  When this measured power is averaged
       over the period of the complete cycle, it matched my calculations.

       My calibrated analog dc milliammeters represented a true average
       current value and so they represented the corrected ON time of the
       primary circuit.  My error was to apply ON time adjustment to the
       "potential"  source  when  the  average  measured  current  already
       contained, in effect, that adjustment.

       There are still rays of hope.  Some "space energy" theory relates
       directly  to  this  circuit  and  its  present  performance.  (See
       supplement.)   A couple of experienced "space energy" researchers
       are puzzled by the circuit's non-conventional features.  I and
       others have gained much experience and knowledge.  By the content of
       this letter, the two supplements, and past correspondence (see also
       KeelyNet files TOD*.*.), my "gain" has been fully shared with many.

       When the required 'special semiconductor material' shows up, many
       more people will now have an easier time in checking out Tom
       Bearden's theory, method #2.

       In the meantime, there is still much to learn.  Why does this simple
       circuit perform as a current amplifier?  Why is the current
       discharge  so  incredibly  slow  for  an  extremely  low  circuit
       resistance?  Why is there so little variation in the performance of
       the circuit when the coil "collector" parameters are adjusted over a
       wide range?  Why is the high current gain limited to a small range
       of on-off ratio and frequency?  Why does the circuit not work with a
       variety of power MOSFETs, even when listed by NTE as equivalent?

       Thanks  for  your  vote  of  confidence  by  publishing  my  earlier
       experience with the Bearden circuit.  It strikes me as a remarkable
       coincidence that the coverage of space energy and a preliminary
       investigation of Bearden's free energy circuit were in the same NEN
       newsletter, and exactly one year after the release of Bearden's
       "The Final Secret of Free Energy".

       There is still a need to test the circuit with Bearden's mysterious
       "degenerative semiconductor material" in the 'collector'.  I have
       found a source of gold ribbon alloy with 12% germanium.  There is
       another source for anodized aluminum foil for testing a capacitor
       'collector'.  Neither source is willing to provide enough sample for
       test and the minimum order for both sources far exceeds my limited
       budget.

       I will keep you posted.  Please let me know if there are any
       questions.

                            The Bearden Circuit and the
                     View of "New Energy News" on Space Energy

       I believe space energy characteristics are behind Bearden's simple
       "free energy" switching circuit.  Here are some NEN comments on
       space energy which relate to my current version of Bearden's
       theoretical switching circuit.  All references are from the Feb.
       '94 issue of New Energy News.

       Space energy is fundamental in stabilizing all matter (pg. 3, col.
       2, para. 1) and is all-pervading without regard to temperature or
       vacuum. (pg. 4, col. 1, para. 4; col. 2, para. 3)  It is from "zero-
       point fluctuations of the background vacuum electromagnetic field".
       (pg. 3, col. 1, para. 3)

       Space energy can be tapped without limit (pg. 4, col. 2, para. 3)
       from an accelerated frame of reference. (pg.9, col. 1, para. 2)
       Electric current through a coil exhibits an aligning effect upon
       space energy.  The process of modifying the alignment of space
       energy couples space energy into electrical coil thus inducing an
       electric current.  Electric induction can therefore be attributed to
       changes in the alignment of space energy. (pg. 9, col.  2, para. 1)

       Solutions for Measurements and Replication

       This version of Bearden's switching circuit presently shows very
       little power capacity but a significant current gain (now up to
       200).  This is without the use of semiconductor material or the use
       of a super high speed switching rate, i.e, 10E-19 sec.  And so we
       are only at the beginning of our potential!  Even though there is
       presently a small current in the primary loop (the ideal is none),
       the switching circuit demonstrates a large current gain when there
       is a sharp pulse (at least on the trailing side), a switch ON of a
       few microseconds to a wire "collector", and a low circuit resistance
       in both the primary and secondary loops.  The "collector" needs to
       be at least 30 feet of 22 gauge.   Longer and larger is okay.

       The ideal measurement tool is a low level DC current probe and a
       digital scope.  When using series in-circuit milli-ammeters, they
       need to have less than 2.0 ohms internal resistance.  These are not
       common.  And so add a shunt to quality low level m icro or milli-
       ammeters.  However, low resistance DC ammeters have difficulty
       reading the low current values in the primary loop.  Determining
       these low values is critical for proper calculation of gain.

       Caution:  A pulsed DC current is not the same thing as an AC signal.
       Many RMS meters are for common AC or AC on DC patterns.  Many
       digital ammeters do not take a fast enough sample or take enough
       samples to integrate a one microsecond pulse that is ON only 0.2 of
       1 percent of the time.  A little arithmetic and a simple series DC
       circuit with an electronic switch will provide ample demonstration.

       Start with a low frequency and an ON OFF ratio of one.  Apply the
       meters and gradually increase the frequency and then gradually
       increase or decrease the ON OFF ratio. This will verify and provide
       a calibration for the meters.

       When there is a very short ON time of a DC pulse relative to a long
       OFF time and when the values are very low on the scale, an extreme
       ON OFF ratio can factor a major significance in determining current
       or power gain.  However, the meter scale can be calibrated by
       substituting a known resistor in the "collector" position.  The
       fixed and known voltage of the Bearden circuit primary loop divided
       by the resistor value times the ON/(ON+ OFF) time will establish the
       correct current value for the scale.

       Calculation of power out is by the current squared times the load
       because  the  high  impedance  of  voltmeters  prevents  them from
       providing an average value with the same relative reference.  Low
       resistance  analog  electromechanical  DC  ammeters  can  provide  a
       reasonably accurate average current value.  This is proven by the
       meters indicating the same current in both loops when using a
       capacitor "collector over a wide range of frequency and ON OFF
       ratios.  This is also proved by a consistent battery time-energy
       drain curve for the same wide range of frequencies and ON OFF
       ratios.  This is for the situation of a load in the secondary loop
       when compared to the same load on a direct battery connection.

       However, there is a limit and be sure to note the caution above.

       In addition to measurement problems, the lack of replication of a
       current gain appears to stem from substituting components with high
       internal resistance, slow switching rate capability, or not matching
       impedance to maintain a sharp pulse.  Even a small signal general
       purpose high frequency FET in only the inverter stage degrades the
       performance.  There are chips and boards especially designed for
       driving power MOSFETs.  And still yet to be tested are those power
       MOSFETs which have a hundred times less internal resistance.

       A recent KeelyNet file called ZPETEST offers additional insight and
       improvements.   (KeelyNet is a free BBS, datum 214-324-3501.)  This
       file suggests my circuit is similar to a conventional flyback
       converter.  The circuit is similar but not equal.  There is no
       evidence of current or voltage leaking from either of the batteries
       into the load.

       The circuit will support additional parallel "Bearden portions" with
       practically no additional burden on the switch and inverter stage.

       Questions?

       Why does this simple circuit perform as a current amplifier?  Why is
       the current discharge so incredibly slow for an extremely low
       circuit resistance?  Why is there so little variation in the
       performance of the circuit when the coil "collector" parameters are
       adjusted over a wide range?  Why is the high current gain limited to
       a small range of on-off ratio and frequency?  Why does the circuit
       not work with a variety of power MOSFETs, even when listed by NTE as
       equivalent?
