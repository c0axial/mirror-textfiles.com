            This SUPERIOR  file  shared  with  KeelyNet  courtesy of fellow
                    researchers Lee Trippett and Dan Davidson.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Lee received a set of KeelyNet files  several  months  back.   After
       studying various files,  he  decided to work with  the  concepts  as
       described in Bearden's paper on "The Final Secret of Free Energy".

       The following description  requires  the  schematic  file TOD.GIF so
       that you can also build and experiment  with this apparent overunity
       device (approximately 1:25 gain).  We here at KeelyNet  urge  you to
       please share your  findings  and  resist the temptation to patent or
       otherwise control free energy technologies.

       Such devices have been discovered  many  times  in  the past and the
       main reason we don't have them in practical use TODAY  is because of
       secrecy, greed and/or  ego.   Some  were  anomalous  or unstable and
       difficult to reproduce but would  it  not  be  to  the  world's best
       interests that what IS known should be available to everyone so that
       we could quantify and improve on it?

                              written by Lee Trippett

       My experiments with  Tom  Bearden's  switching  circuit  theoretical
       concepts seems to  show  a significant power gain.  This is supposed
       to be against all the textbook rules which are currently in vogue.

       With the my version of Bearden's  switching  circuit  it  is easy to
       show a dramatic increase in current through a fixed load, even while
       the battery current  decreases.   This  gives  the   impression  and
       calculation of a power gain but there are other considerations.

       Many major national  suppliers  of  electrical  conducting wire have
       been called and not one had any wire  with  a specification relating
       to relaxation time,  i.e. the time it takes for electrons  to  start
       moving after a  potential  is applied.  (This is not the same as the
       time for a signal to travel along the circuit.)

       The "Handbook of  Chemistry  and   Physics  1993"  and  "McGraw-Hill
       Encyclopedia of Science   and  Technology"  were  checked,   without
       success, for a listing of relaxation times for various conducting

                                      Page 1





       materials.  Therefore, I  tried  to  simulate  a  delay  by  placing
       silicon diodes or a very long wire  between the battery, switch, and
       'collector'.

       These two 'delay  items'  were  placed  in  a synchronized  flexible
       switch circuit which  was developed according to the Bearden circuit
       requirements.  (See Bearden's KeelyNet file 'FREENRG4.ASC' method 2,
       datum 1-214-324-3501. This is a free  BBS.   Other related files are
       Sweet*.*, ZPE*.*, Reply*.*, & Polarize.*)

       A sharp (20 nanosecond rise/fall time) ON switch  pulse  of  1  to 5
       microseconds is directed  to  a  power MOSFET (Q2) between a battery
       (V2) and 'collector' with a following synchronized ON pulse directed
       to Q3 which is up to 10 times greater than the time constant between
       the 'collector' and load. (See schematic.)

       Data has been plotted for the current,  voltage,  and time of carbon
       zinc batteries.  These  are  cheaper  and quicker to  run  down  for
       measuring energy loss.

       Bearden's theory requires  very fast switching times.  Anything less
       than one microsecond is very expensive.   This is where I decided to
       try Mr. William Price's suggestion of 1500 feet of solid copper wire
       (see KeelyNet file 'RELAX1.ASC').

       This length should  give  a  delay  of 1.5 microseconds.  The  first
       observation was a  reverse  in  the direction of current in the load
       circuit (mA3) and it (this reversal)  was much more than the battery
       current (mA2).

       Regardless of the   switching   rate,   on/off   ratio,    capacitor
       'collector' size, or  presence of diodes the 'energy loss' curve for
       these 9V batteries is remarkably consistent when the average current
       is held constant.  (40ma for a 9V  carbon zinc battery seems optimum
       for an energy curve that is consistent and can be  seen  in  a short
       time of 20  to  30 minutes.) For a wire 'collector' the energy drain
       for the battery  (V2)  is  considerably  less  for  a  40  ma  'load
       current'.  (See chart.)

       For a wide range of on/off ratio and frequency the  current  in both
       loops is always the same when any size ordinary capacitor is used as
       the 'collector'.  This  is  for fixed resistor loads of 1, 2, 4, 12,
       33, and 190 ohms.

       For Bearden's portion of the circuit,  the computation of 'power in'
       by V2 x  mA2 x (on time)/(on plus off time) is always  greater  than
       the computation of 'power out' by mA3 squared times load resistance.
       (I have no  means  for  measuring  average  voltage  for  a  complex
       waveform.)

       With a dual trace scope on the 'source'  of  Q2  and  Q3 one can see
       clearly the  synchronized  switching action and the charge-discharge
       curves.  The 'energy'  drain  on the battery (V2) is always directly
       related to the average pulsed current  in the battery circuit.  This
       is equivalent to the energy drain for the same current in a directly
       connected non-switched load to the battery.

       For a wire 'collector' and a rather narrow range of  pulse width and
       frequency (see schematic notes) the current in loop Q3 reverses

                                      Page 2





       direction and can  be  more  than  40  times the current in loop Q2.
       (I've measured as much as a 60 to 1 ratio.)  Note: The wire does not
       need to be in a coil form.

       The circuit represents a 'current (and power?) amplifier' for a wire
       'collector' and a 'power control' for a capacitor 'collector'.  This
       conclusion is based on a measured  1  ma,  8  volt  value in loop Q2
       which calculates as 8 mw.

       The corresponding values in loop Q3 can be up to 40 ma through 1 ohm
       which is 1.6  mw  for a significant power loss instead  of  a  gain.
       However, when the input power computation is adjusted for the actual
       'time-on' for the  battery  (V2)  there  is  a computational show of
       power gain by as much as a factor of 25.

       However, actual current flow is not  only  determined by the voltage
       and load but also by:

            1) pulse width for both loops;
            2) time constant for both loops; and
            3) on-off period (frequency).

       For a dramatic visual demonstration of a 'current gain', do this:

            set a  specific  value  of  pulse  width and frequency  for  an
            ordinary 1  uf metal film capacitor 'collector' so that current
            in both the Q2 and Q3 loops is 4 ma.

       When a wire  coil of 40 ft. #22 solid  magnet  wire  is  substituted
       without changing anything else the current reverses direction in the
       Q3 loop, the current in loop Q2 drops to 1 ma, and  the  current  in
       loop Q3 increases to 40 ma.

       How can 40  ma (10 times more output current with 4 times less input
       power) be pushed through exactly the  same load by simply (and only)
       replacing a capacitor with a chunk of wire?

       Because a 1 ohm load for a 9 volt source should theoretically  allow
       9 amps.  It  is  the  switching  characteristics, time constant, and
       frequency which have a greater control on the resulting current than
       does the load or supply voltage.

       The attached battery energy drain  curves look like a very promising
       'power gain' but can be easily misinterpreted for the  reasons  just
       stated.   (By the  way, the current in mA1 remains unchanged in this
       switch of passive nonlinear 'collector' components.  This current is
       about 10 ma and could probably be  much less by using a small signal
       FET inverter stage.  This current is the same without any connection
       to the two FET's Q2 and Q3.)

       When using a  wire  'collector' the current ratio increases  as  the
       voltage for V2   increases.    This   seems   to  confirm  Bearden's
       theoretical discovery but the surprising  results  I  assume are the
       result, in part,  of  an  autotransformer effect by  means  of  self
       induction.  The current ratio decreases as the load increases.

       The current ratio  increases  as  the  'coil  collector'  resistance
       decreases.  The load current increases  as  the period of the on/off
       cycle decreases.

       Two experienced electronic   engineers   are   convinced   there  is
       something wrong with the circuit  or  instruments  and  that  it  is
       impossible to have a power gain.  They are unwilling  to  admit that
       the vacuum of the universe is indeed a plenum full of energy.

       It will be  hard for many to realize that it is impossible to have a
       'closed system' with the new insight of reality as summarized by Tom
       Bearden.

       Potentiometers R1 through  R6  should  be  set  at   the   following
       approximate values and  should  be adjusted for the maximum gain for
       your circuit, they adjust the on/off time of the 555 timer :

            R1 -  ~7K resistor
            R2 - ~100 ohm resistor
            R3 - ~470 ohm resistor
            R4 - ~190 ohm resistor
            R5 - ~190 ohm resistor
            R6 - ~2.2Kohm resistor

            (These initial values may vary depending on the Qn MOSFETs)
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       The Power MOSFETs are used as high speed switches.

       The Load is a 1 to 4 ohm fixed resistor.   Greater  resistor  values
       will reduce the current ratio when using a wire coil as a collector.

       Current is always a function of the settings for R1  and R2.  Adjust
       the frequency to   about   3kHZ  with  a  pulse  width  of  about  2
       microseconds for a current amplification  of  at least 40 to 1 which
       translates to a 25 over-unity gain in power out.

       The "collector" is  a wire coil.  Coils which give  similar  results
       are ;

            (1) 500 foot coil of solid core, 12 gauge copper wire,
            (2) 100 foot coils of 22 gauge solid hookup wire, and
            (3) 40 foot coils of #22 magnet wire.

       The important thing to note is the inverter should be setup so Q2 is
       ON and Q3  is  OFF and vice versa and the pulse shapes are preserved
       as much as possible going into Q2  and  Q3.   The  MOSFETs  must  be
       REALLY OFF or parasitic current losses will occur.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       The following is  an excerpt removed from the file  FREENRG4.ASC  as
       written by Tom Bearden.

          (2) The second way is to "trap the electron gas electrons" in a
              separate  collector,  feed  "current-free  potential" to the
              collector from   a   primary   battery  or  other  source  of
              potential, and   collect    a    bunch   of   excess   energy
              (potential) in  the  collector's  "penned  up  free  electron
              'horses'" waiting  to carry the excess energy to the load and
              dissipate it there, once they have been released.

              Then, one switches the primary potential source away from the
              collector, while the "energy-loaded horses" are still trapped
              and straining at the bit, so  that  no work can be done __ by
              those agitated horses when they stampede out  of  there __ on
              the internal  resistance of the primary source, to destroy or
              reduce it.

              In the  same  switching  action,   the   collector  with  its
              "snorting but  still  trapped  electron horses"  is  switched
              across the  load  to form a totally separate circuit with it,
              having nothing at all to do  with the original primary source
              of potential.   Then, the agitated horses are  released,  and
              thunder out through the load, scattering their riders (excess
              energy) in  all  directions  in the load, producing work/heat
              and powering the load.  They  will   also  charge  on  around
              to  the  reverse  side of  the collector, and kill its charge
              separation (kill  its potential) as well, just  as  does  any
              ordinary circuit.

              The major disadvantage of method 1, as we presently have seen
              it done (however, check Barrett's demonstration that Tesla's
              patented circuitry  is  capable  of  doing  it  by  circuitry
              alone), is that time-reversed electrical energy is produced.

              So Method 1 has some serious drawbacks. "Time-reversed energy
              stuff", which should stay in  the atomic nucleus as Newtonian
              3rd law  reactions and 3rd-law energy exchanges,  is  dragged
              out.

              Unusual effects on biological systems can occur.  Antigravity
              effects can  occur.  Other hidden processes in the universes,
              that affect  the  atomic  nucleus,  can  be  gated  into  the
              external circuitry,  causing  disaster.  Monopoles   can   be
              deposited in  the  magnets, causing them to explode like hand
              grenades.  Most  of  the new  "massive  time-reverse  energy"
              phenomenology is still unknown.

              One cannot at this stage of ignorance adequately guarantee
              human safety. I presently don't see just how this kind of
              energy  can  pass  an  Underwriter  Laboratories' testing and
              certification, until a lot more exhaustive  work  is  done to
              understand the new phenomenology.


                                      Page 5





       Method 2, however,  yields  ordinary,  garden-variety, positive-time
       electrical energy. The method presented  in  the  paper  is  my  own
       discovery. No unusual  time-reversed  phenomena  are  involved.   It
       would appear to  be eminently practical to produce and certify power
       units based on Method 2. The phenomenology and risks are the same as
       for ordinary, time-forward power systems.

       Method 2 has another unique characteristic:  as  a  system,  all the
       subsystems are already  in the literature and validated.  They  have
       just  not  previously   been   put   together  in  this fashion.  So
       development of the system really represents an "integration" problem
       only,  after  one  first  does  a  little  development  of a proper
       degenerate semiconductor material (DSM).

       In other words, one first develops (and tests) the exact doping
       materials and percentage, to get a DSM material that is still a good
       conductor but has a relaxation time of __ say __ one tenth of a
       millisecond. One builds the wires from the battery to the collector
       out of this new DSM material. If one uses a capacitor for the
       collector, the plates must be made out of the new DSM material, not
       out of normal "pure conductor" material.

       Then one develops a switcher that switches in one tenth (or less)
       the relaxation time of the DSM, or in this case in one hundredth of
       a millisecond. That switching time,  of  course,  is  easy  for  any
       decent electronic technician or electronic engineer.

       One also develops a timing circuit that will

           (1)  sense the status of the discharge of the collector energy
                through the load, and
           (2)  trigger the switching at the correct times so that a smooth
                two-cycle (collect, discharge) process results. Note that
                the lengths of cycle one and cycle two are not necessarily
                equal  at  all.  One  may  use  multiple collectors/loads
                simultaneously, cascaded collectors/loads,  etc.   Hundreds
                of variations are possible and feasible.

       It is not possible to do anything with this discovery in a normal
       manner. I would dearly like to be economically independent, so I
       could work full time in my efforts on free energy, antigravity,
       extended EM healing, cancer, etc.

       Many orthodox scientists  will  also fiercely  resist  this  upstart
       notion  of  "overunity" electrical machines to the bitter end.  When
       powerful economic interests realize  one  has  such things for real,
       one is certainly going to be stopped, jailed, or killed,  or  he may
       just "mysteriously vanish" and never be seen again.

       So I just freely released and distributed my discovery of method 2,
       in the paper "The Final Secret of Free Energy". It is deliberately
       targeted toward technicians, junior engineers, and educated laymen.
       (The principles and definitions raised, however, can be debated to
       the nth degree by knowledgeable foundation scientists).

       The paper has already been distributed worldwide. Now the principles
       and definitions are  available  to  everyone.  If they are in error,
       shortly that will be proven in spades.   If  they  are correct, that
       will also be established shortly.

       Anyone who wishes can develop and patent a particular application.
       There's no longer any way to stop this information from being
       disseminated and utilized. I hope that a flurry of development and
       patenting activity will result around the world.

       Vangard Note

          The above  information  relates  to  Bearden's  observation  that
          potential can  be  trapped  in such a way as to avoid the flow of
          current.  It is easy to think of this in the following manner:

          Current flows on the surface of conductors, not on the interior.
          When voltage is applied to a conductor, it must "fill it up" from
          the inside  out.  That voltage  "filling"  effect  is  where  the
          circuit is coming to unity with the voltage source  and  so, in a
          manner of  speaking,  is  creating  a "well" or hole that must be
          filled.

          There is no current actually passed  OVER  the  surface UNTIL the
          conductor has  filled  FROM the inside TO the outside.   At  that
          point, the voltage "translates" into current.

          It is at this point, that the voltage (potential) must be removed
          from the circuit, that is, BEFORE current actually can flow.  The
          relaxation time  of  the  conductor is thus how long it takes the
          conductor to fill up.

          The circuit must be timed so  that  the  potential  fills  up the
          "collector" (coil  of  wire), then is rapidly switched  INTO  the
          load where  it  dissipates  in  the  form  of  heat or work.  The
          collector is then switched back to again "fill up".

          information or research results and we wish you  success  in your
          experiments.
