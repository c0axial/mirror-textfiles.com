THE MYSTERY OF "FREE ENERGY": WHERE DOES IT COME FROM?
By Rolf Schaffranke
(taken from The Manual of Free Energy Devices and Systems Vol. II)

Since major breakthroughs in the physics of non-conventional energy generation
and energy conversion have already been made in several countries, it seems
appropriate to present the main points of the ongoing changes in research in a
convenient Question and Answer format which allows a selective overview of the
highlights of newly established facts and observations.

Please remember that big name, long established companies have long abdicated
the main part of their research initiative to government planners and we no
longer can look to them for leadership.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:  "Where does the energy potential for the operation of the new
            'converters' actually come from?"

Answer:   The energy is extracted from the G-Field, formerly known also as the
          Ether-Field, identifiable today as a real acceptable, sub nuclear
          and sub-quantic medium" In the past, this medium was given various
          names, such as PRANA, by the Indians; ORGONE, by Dr., Wilhelm Reich;
          ODIC FORCE, by Baron Von Reichenbach; ANIMAL MAGNETISM, by Franz A
          Messmer , MUMIA, by ParaceIsus ; BIO-COSMIC ENERGY, by Dr. Brunler;
          ELOPTIC ENERGY, by Dr. Hieronymus; X-FORCE, by Dr. Eeeman (UK )

          Today, it is commonly referred to by one of the following definition
          NEUTRINO SEA, by Prof.  P.A.M. Dirac; RADIANT ENERGY, by Dr.  T.H.
          Moray, FERMI SEA; PRIMARY ENERGY; TACHYON FIELD, Prof. G. Feinberg;
          ZERO POINT ENERGY; GRAVITY FIELD ENERGY. or G-FIELD;  SPACE ENERGY,
          all merely euphemisms..... what Aristotle once chose to call
          "ETHER".

Question: "What is the magnitude of this field energy potential?."

Answer: The energy content of the G-Field was calculated as
             (1)  l0 ~33 cm3 by Sir Oliver Lodge, England,
             (2)  8.8x10~8 volts/cm by Prof. S. Seike Japan,
             (3)  250 billion Joule/ml by Rene L. Vallee, France.

        To repeat a popular conversion figure published in Switzerland, the
        energy content of One Liter of SPACE is about equal to the energy of
        5000 Liters of gasoline.

        A remarkable confirmation of the claims of Nicola TESLA who, more than
        100 years ago, expressed his belief that "before many generations will
        have passed," mankind will be able to extract unlimited power at any
        place,"

 Question: "Which scientists of repute (Nobel Prize winners) are, or were in
            favor of the 'ETHER' (G-FIELD)?"

Answer:  Some of the world renown scientists who affirmed their belief in the
         existence of a universal ETHER Or  Force field are;
         JAMES CLERK-MAXWELL: "'A material substance of a more subtle kind
                               than visible bodies, supposed to exist in those
                               parts of space which are apparently empty,"
         Prof., Paul DIRAC, N.L, 195 1, deBROGLIE, N.L.  1959. MICHELSON: "
                              "Even if relativity is hereto stay we don't have
                               to reject the 'ETHER' ".
         Sir OLIVER LODGE: "The Ether is a physical thing, we can only get it
                            electrically"
         STARK, N,L,;
         ARRHENIUS, N,L,;
         A, H.  COMPTON, N, L., P,E:
         A.  LENARD, N.L.;
         H.  UUKAWA, N.L.;
         F.  SODDY, N,L..
         Albert EINSTElN: ""There are weighty arguments to be adduced in favor
                            of the ether hypothesis. To deny the ether is
                            ultimately to assume that empty space has no
                            physical qualities whatever, The fundamental facts
                            of mechanics do not harmonize with this view...
                            According  to the General Theory of Relativity,
                            space is endowed with physical qualities ; in this
                            sense, therefore, there exists an ether.
                            According to the General Theory of Relativity
                            space without ether is unthinkable. ."

The above quote by Dr. Albert Einstein was published in 1920, based on
Einstein's speech at the University of Leiden, Holland, (May 5, 1920).

The publication was in German, and translated by Sir Oliver Lodge into
English, quoted from his book, "Ether and Relativity" (1925).  However
practically all textbooks in physics omit this fact,  Einstein himself has
gone on record stating on his 70th birthday .

   "Now  you think that I am looking back at my life's work with calm
    satisfaction. But, on closer look, it is quite different. There is not a
    single concept of which I am convinced that it will stand firm and I am
    not sure if I was on the right track after all:"

Question: "What about conservation of energy law pertaining to the operation
           of cosmic energy converters and motors? "

Answer: ".. every emission or absorption of virtual particles already accepted
         to totally violate conservation of energy. That is, emission
         represents the sudden appearance of extra energy in the ordinary
         universe, and absorption represents the sudden disappearance of some
         energy from the ordinary universe  Every charged particle in the
         universe constantly does both processes, Even the neutron is
         continually breaking into different virtual, charged particles, So
         every piece of mass in the universe, ACCORDING TO ORDINARY Y PARTICLE
         PHYSICS-is already violating conservation of energy on the micro
         level...

         ...a strong magnetic pole represents an additional stress in space-
         time, (the G.Field, R,S.) as does a strong static electric charge.
         Either of these situations warps and twists space-time itself, This
         in the region of a magnetic pole or of a strong static charge,
         conservation of energy need not apply, Specifically, for large,
         massive atoms of some heavy elements violation of ordinary ""linear"
         magnetism-and hence of the linear conservation of energy law-has
         already been noted.

This is particularly interesting since, with a permanent magnet, one can apply
spatiotemporal (G-Field) stress in a locality without any further input of
energy. The entire business of using this produce a free energy device depends
simply on the cleverness of the inventor.

It is also possible to time the applications of both effects-static electric
stress and magnetic monopolar stress  with an ordinary electromagnetic rotary
device to produce seemingly ""Free" energy. And so the potential is there for
free energy. To the question, "Can it in principle be done?', we must
definitely answer, ""Yes, if we believe our present physics "

The second question, ""How difficult is it to do?", can be answered in several
ways; possibly the best is: ""if one is clever and gets back to absolute,
simple fundamentals, it may be possible to do it cheaply and in a
straightforward, practical manner,"

Question: "Operation of such a G-Field or Tachyon Field energy converter would
           be in violation of the scientific fact that a perpetual mobile is
           clearly impossible, Any comments?"'

Answer:  This applied only to so-called " 'closed systems" in our technology,
         like turbines, combustion engines, steam engines, etc.

Nature shows that the movement of electrons around the atomic nuclear, planets
around the suns, etc., are indeed all genuine "'Perpetual mobiles" since they
represent " open systems," interacting with various fields of electrical,
gravitational etc., nature

Examples of Perpetual Mobile Actions are, among others:
     A) the Bessler Wheel (1712 to 1717),
     B) The Foucalt Pendulum (France) both are powered by the rotation of the
        earth, " The earlier, original concept of perpetual motion refers
        merely to any device that does work in excess of its energy input.
        This does not exclude an unseen energy source (such as the G-Field!)
        as the input to a perpetual motion device. lt is this that separates
        practical perpetual motion from the laws of thermodynamics!"

published in PROCEEDINGS of the First International Symposium of Non
Conventional Energy Technology, October 2324, 1981, University of  Toronto,

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question: "Why are permanent magnets so important in connection with design of
           G-field converters?"

Answer: Permanent magnets act as 'cosmic energy pumps' or 'gravitational
        diodes.' The space energy or GField can be concentrated, focused
        magnified and compacted by strong magnetic fields. The development of
        very strong magnets, so-called 'Super Magnets' (NIB's) made from
        exotic alloys makes GField converters and generators possible.

QUOTE: "I think it is possible to utilize magnetism as an energy source But we
        science idiots cannot do this; this has to come from the outside. "

   (Werner Heisenbert  Nobel Laureates as quoted in the book: "Energie im
    Uberfluss" by Hilscher 1981.

Question..  "What are the prerequisites for successful R & D efforts leading
             to mass production and licensing of G-Field converters? "

Answer: 1) Identification and refinement of the best developed, most
           economical, most promising conceptual approach.
        2) Close international contacts to assure a flow of up to date
           information about all new developments in this technology area in
           order to avoid dead-end approaches.
        3) Follow the newly developed super magnet technology in all countries
           with special emphasis on samariumcobalt and neodynium compounds
           (neodyniumironboron) and other new materials.
        4) application of vortex technology within the known laws of fluid
           dynamics and nuclear dynamics.
        5) Sufficient long-term funding for success by attracting venture
           capital, by offering of tax write-offs plus an inflation proof
           potential return. (As a tax write-off  it can be more attractive to
           an investor than giving to a favorite charity  Note: Over 100% in
           the U.S.A.)
        6) In general  logical thinking and ethical handling of the project in
           question by all partners will assure success.

(Note: In reference to Item 5 above): Since the IRS Vs SNOW case of 1974, it
is held that a new limited partnership organized for the purpose of financing
the development of a new process or product is entitled to deduct research
experimentation and development costs.

It is of course extremely difficult to put a price tag on the results of R & D
in an area of revolutionary technology.

However there is no doubt whatsoever about the feasibility of the technology
as such.

Quotations:  R. Buckminster Fuller
      1) "There isn't any energy crisis. It's simply a crisis of ignorance"
      2) "It is amazing that in the sub micro world of the atom quantum
          physics requires the perpetual motion of particles both as to spin
          and orbital motions. In the macro world, science is based on the law
          that a perpetual motion machine is absolutely impossible. "
