       Vangard note...

          This file  recounts  experiments  in which the author (unknown to
          us) believes to have mentally  influenced  the  images  on  a  TV
          screen through a closed loop system.  They are reminscent  of the
          phenomena
          recorded by  the  Fishbach  family  in Germany using expanded EVP
          techniques.  Our friend Dr. Walter  Uphoff,  director  of the New
          Science Frontiers has been investigating these experiments.

          The Fishbach  family claims to have used a B&W  TV  which  had  a
          video camera  aimed directly at the screen.  The output from this
          video camera was sent into a video  recorder  in  the record mode
          and which then sent the recorded image back into  the  TV.   This
          made for a closed loop system.  It has been estimated that proper
          conditions will  yield  visible  images  of  ghostly images, many
          times known to those present.   The startling thing is that these
          are RECORDED for later analysis on the tape.

          We have  been fortunate to see some of these video  segments  and
          they show  the  formation  of  a  snowy  ball of light which then
          gradually forms into a human shape  or  face.  Some of these have
          background images also, that is one showed the Fishbachs deceased
          daughter of 7 years running on a beach.

          Note that  most successful EVP requires a high noise  environment
          to allow  for  the  suppression  and enhancement of those signals
          that can be so "modulated" as to  impart  information in the form
          of speech or images.

          Of course,  the  usual  suspicion  is  that of stray  signals  or
          outright fakery yet steps have been taken to prevent this.  It is
          definitely an area worthy of further experimentation.

          Interestingly enough,  Keely  says  that  the formation of such a
          closed loop created what he called  a  "sensitized  center"  that
          then became exquisitely sensitive to any outside vibrations.

                   Successful Recreation of IdEAL ORDER Psychic
                    TV Luminescence Using Home Video Equipment

       One of the main problems with proving that IdEAL ORDER Psychic TV
       was an actual and scientifically testable phenomenon was the

                                      Page 1





       procurement of broadcast video equipment for a test that was
       personally affordable.  Because the effect had previously relied
       solely upon the use of professional equipment, a working
       relationship with the television media was a necessity and an
       unworkable problem.  (Since 1982 I have used this phenomenon as a
       device to create havoc in the incipient mind of the corporate
       televised media.  I have requested help in this testing from
       several television stations with little avail. ;)

       In early 1984 we contacted the CSICOP through Mr. Richard Busch
       to attempt to gain their help in this testing.  He recommended I
       recreate the effect through a closed circuit video system.  I
       found such a system at Loyola University in New Orleans and
       proceeded to attempt to recreate the luminescent phenomenon.  It
       did not work.

       When I reported the findings to Mr. Busch he remarked that there was
       evidently no effect.   (He  should  have  talked to Dan Rather about
       that!)  I commented that the effect  had  never  worked  in a closed
       circuit environment and that it would seem to require  some  form of
       broadcast to enable  its recreation.  He repeated his assertion that
       there was no effect and insisted I never bothered him with it again.

       Last September, through the use of home video equipment (obtained
       through the DAK catalog), I recreated the flickering luminescent
       phenomenon inside the lens of an 8mm camcorder.  The video equipment
       I used is usually employed to broadcast  home  video  signals  to  a
       video receiver for  the  purpose of the expansion  of  home  viewing
       possibilities.  The broadcast   equipment   consists   of   a  video
       transmitter and a video receiver designed  to broadcast no more than
       100 feet.

       I connected an  8mm  Sony  camcorder to the home transmission  unit.
       The receiver unit  was  connected  to  a  videotape recorder and its
       output displayed through my television set.

       I placed the camcorder directly in  front  of a mirror in such a way
       that the camcorder was only recording images of its  own  lens.  The
       video signal was transmitted approximately 2 feet and there was no
       electronic connection between the camcorder and the television.

       I partially darkened  the  room (a small amount of ambient light was
       needed in order to keep the camcorder  recording)  and  proceeded to
       meditate upon the received broadcast.  This was difficult  as  I was
       not accustomed to "zapping" a 19 inch image of a lens.

       Usually when I  use this phenomenon it is for the purpose of shining
       light on a person; a transmission  of luminescent consciousness; not
       for the mere creation of light.  There was no effect  for  about  15
       minutes but finally, there appeared a tiny flickering light near the
       lower middle of  the  lens of the camcorder.  This tiny dot of light
       changed size and  intensity  continuously   and  would  reappear  in
       different parts of the camera lens.

       It was interesting  in that I could feel a correlation  between  the
       luminescence and my  mental  states.  I am presently determining the
       possibility of controlling electronic music systems with this effect
       by means of a computer genlock syncing to the video signal.


                                      Page 2





       For over 40  minutes  I  recorded  this  phenomenon and continued to
       attempt to amplify the effect (with some small success).  It appears
       that because of  the small size  of  the  lens  and  of  the  light-
       receptive surfaces on the camcorder that this effect  will  continue
       to be slight   when   created   using   home  video  equipment,  but
       nonetheless real and repeatable.

       I therefore insist that the CSICOP discontinue its attempts to deny
       the phenomenon its legitimacy and grant me a public testing date.
