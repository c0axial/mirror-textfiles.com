       Vangard Notes >>>

            We of  Vangard  Sciences  highly  recommend  that everyone read
            David Fasolds' book "THE ARK  OF NOAH." I know that some of you
            are going  to wonder why should they should take  the  time  to
            read about Noah and the Ark of Man.

            In Mr.  Fasolds'  book he covers many things that have happened
            in the past that can be related  to  our present as well as our
            future.

            Jerry Decker  and I - Ronald Barker have had  the  pleasure  of
            meeting Mr.  Fasold  on  several  occasions,  and found that he
            tells you all the true facts  and leaves out the BS, just as he
            does in his book.  He gives you the information to back up what
            he says.

            Mr. Fasolds' discovery of the ARK of Noah has  been verified by
            some of  the  top  scientists  in the field. Mr. Ron Wyatt from
            Madison, Tennessee one of the  top scientists in the country on
            sub-surface radar  research,  Dr.  John  Baumgardner  from  Los
            Alamos research   center,  Mr.  Vendyl  Jones  (A.K.A.  Indiana
            Jones)., and many others who we will not list.

            David makes no claims as to actually  discovering  the Ark.  He
            rediscovered it after many other researchers had pronounced the
            site as not the remains of a ship, but a geological formation.

            The true discoverer of the Ark is a Turkish farmer named Reshit
            Sarihan.  An  earthquake  occurred  in 1948 which  shifted  the
            ground where the Ark had rested all these centuries.

            At that  time,  not  much notice was taken of the exposed shape
            until a military photo reconaissance  overflight  took pictures
            which showed the shape of a very large ship.

            However, David  did  make  the  contacts  and   do   the  quite
            incredible amount  of  research  necessary to locate and verify
            his site as the TRUE ARK of NOAH.

            He has spent over $100,000 of  his own money and in excess of 6
            years on  the  ARK  project.   We consider ourselves  extremely
            fortunate to  have  been allowed to meet such a fascinating and
            capable researcher as David  Fasold.    His  work  is currently
            unappreciated and not even suspected by the masses.

            It seems  orthodox  Christianity MUST FIND THE ARK ON THE MOUNT
            OF ARARAT TO VERIFY THEIR FAITH.  In truth, the translations in
            the Bible have been so in error  that many people searching for
            these wonderful historical treasures have been led astray.

            The primary  problem  has been their failure to  consult  other
            ancient texts concurrent with the event.  Corruption of records
            takes on an almost logarthmic certainty as time passes.

            Each ruler  wants  history  to  begin with him or to alter past
            history to his views.

            This is one of the things we  most  admired  about  David,  his
            tenacity and his wide ranging research efforts.   He  consulted
            dozens of  texts  including  the  Torah, the Koran, the Epic of
            Gilgamesh and many others to piece together the true location.

            If you ever get a chance to hear  him speak or to meet or speak
            with him, DON'T PASS IT UP!  He will hypnotize and enthrall you
            with his anecdotes and the recounting of his discovery  of  the
            ARK.

            I -  Jerry  Decker,   had  the  privilege of attending the 1989
            International Geophysical Symposium  as a guest of Vendyl Jones
            and David Fasold.

            Both gave presentations which simply mesmerized these Engineers
            and Scientists from all over the world.  It was  truly  amazing
            to see  how these people clustered around both David and Vendyl
            to ask questions about their researches.

            Another thing that David has  noted  which  we  all  find  very
            interesting is that the day of the earthquake  in  1948  is the
            same date  that  Israel  became  a  nation, just as in Biblical
            prophecy!

            The following story is taken  from David Fasolds' book "THE ARK
            OF NOAH", published in 1988 by Wynwood Press of New York.

            The ISBN  number is 0-922066-10-8 and it can  be  ordered  from
            most book  suppliers  such  as  Taylors  or Waldenbooks.  David
            tells us it is soon to come out in paperback.

                      The hardback version sells for $18.95.

                     BUY IT, you will not regret the purchase!


            To give you an idea of what  is  in  his  book  we  include the
            Preface written  by David Fasold, the introduction  written  by
            Charles Berlitz  and  Chapter  2  pages  52  to  56  title HOMO
            IGNORAMUS.

            The chapter points out that in  pre-flood  times, the calendars
            registered 360  days per year.  After the flood  the  calendars
            changed to 365 days a year.

            David found  an interesting Egyptian myth which tells the story
            of how the Moon was coerced into sharing some of its light.  In
            fact, it had to do with a slowing  down of the Earth's rotation
            which, since  it is a giant armature, necessarily  reduced  the
            magnetic field.

            Zecharia Sitchin's  excellent books also give many translations
            relating to events in pre-dawn times.

            Also why did people live such  long life spans as compared with
            people of today.  Is it possible that the slowing  down  of the
            Earth's rotation  caused  a change in the human body's electric
            field due to the decreased magnetism?

            Is this why the Dinosaurs died out?

            Or could it be that one who had eaten of the "AMOMUM" root (the
            root of Youth) as mentioned in the Epic of Gilgamesh:

                " Its name is The Old Will Be Made Young. "

                  I too will eat it, and I will return to
                  What I Was In My Youth."

                ( These are some of the questions into which we of
                  Vangard Sciences are interested and looking into.)

       Mr. Fasolds' book can be purchased  at  any  book  store  or you can
       write to him.

                                   Brief Review

                                  THE ARK OF NOAH

                                        by

                                   DAVID FASOLD

       --------------------------------------------------------------------


            The Ark  of  Noah  is  the  story  behind  one  of the greatest
       archaeological finds of the century.  Read  either as an astonishing
       story of archaeological detection, or as an undeniable  confirmation
       of the Old  Testament  account of Noah's Ark, this book is important
       beyond question.

            David Fasold  had  become  fascinated  with  the  centuries-old
       mystery of Noah's Ark and decided to search for it himself.  Heading
       one of the  last  teams  allowed  excavation rights  in  Turkey,  he
       deduced the Ark  landed  not  on Mount Ararat, as had been popularly
       thought, but on  Mount  Mahser Dagi  (the  Doomsday  Mountain)  some
       seventeen miles south of the traditional site.

            An outlined structure had been uncovered on  Mahser  Dagi  in a
       1948 earthquake, but  geologists  had  reckoned  it  to be a natural
       object. David Fasold's  translations   and  interpretations  of  the
       Sumerian accounts of  the  Great  Flood led him inexorably  back  to
       Mahser Dagi. He  uncovered stone sculptures previously thought to be
       totem or steles dating from the proper period. In fact, these carved
       monoliths were deemed anchors from a seagoing craft - a craft Fasold
       determined to be the Ark of Noah.

            Fasold's team ascended Mahser  Dagi  and found the remains of a
       boat whose dimensions exactly matched those given in Genesis. To his
       surprise, drilling samples revealed the boat to be made not of wood,
       as was commonly supposed, but of reed and pumice (gopher  wood), and
       constructed using techniques historically coincident to Noah's time.
       After the discovery,  Fasold's  site  was  sealed off and officially
       declared the landing place of Noah's Ark by the Turkish government.

            Filled with incontrovertible  photographs of the actual Ark, as
       well as documents of the material analysis, David Fasold's  The  Ark
       of Noah is  a  compelling and controversial addition to the world of
       popular archaeology.

            David Fasold is a former merchant  marine  officer.  Nearly two
       decades as a marine salvage expert provided him with  the background
       and knowledge that proved indispensable to his later expeditions.

            "The usual  pattern  for  searches  to take place only on Mount
       Ararat has been changed by the exploratory  investigations  of David
       Fasold."

                                    The Preface

                                  by David Fasold

                          from his book "The Ark of Noah"

            In an  attempt  to  establish  the origin of modern man and the
       seed that has germinated into the  flourishing of civilizations, the
       archaeologist has lifted his brush from the sands of time to paint a
       portrait of the   ancient  Near  East  splashed   with   colors   of
       enlightenment.

            For his   devoted   labors   in  illuminating  these  areas  of
       understanding, we are grateful. But  it  remains  a  painting poorly
       executed, for the artists of anthropology have not  yet succeeded in
       producing within that  balance of shadow and light any expression of
       harmony that allows the viewer to envision from whence he came.

            This painting remains muddled  by  a  modern-day  myth that the
       legends burned into the memories of the ancients and  impressed onto
       tables of clay were not actual records of an historical event.

            Thus the  historians have failed to reclaim from obscurity that
       dark "land of the crossings" from  which  the  settlers  have  come,
       survivors of an advanced culture that was cleaved  by  an  event  of
       such catastrophic proportions as to literally divide history and the
       development of man into a new age.

            This experience  of an overwhelming deluge still remains as the
       most solemn and awesome recollection of the human race.

            My portrayal,  then  is  the  fertile  crescent  born  anew,  a
       rejuvenation of civilization reawakened from a slumber  of  the dead
       by the descendants  of  this  past age, borne upon the survival ship
       that traversed the eras in a voyage  of  circumstance and necessity,
       the descendants of Noah and progenitors of modern man.

            In the attempt to retrace our ancestors' footsteps  to the door
       of the Ark itself, however attractive such a mission might appear, I
       have failed to   interest   the   Academic  community  at  large  in
       participating.

            Understandably, such a proposal raises serious doubts. But when
       an invitation is  extended  to view  the  tangible  remains  of  the
       antediluvian vessel high upon the mountains of Urartu,  the response
       of science should be investigation pure and simple, not ridicule and
       scorn.

            Perhaps reluctance  on  their part is the only safe ground, for
       should this prove  to  be  the  most   controversial  artifact  ever
       recorded, the legend is exonerated and the biblical Flood is true.

            Even their high towers of "qualifications" will  not  save them
       from the deluge of error.

            Does the  theory  that  man  has come from the lowest depths of
       humanity to his present elevated position have validity?  Is it time

                                      Page 5

       for the history  of  man  to  be  rewritten,  this  time  with  more
       foundation and truth?

            Or is it time to return to the original accounts, and read them
       with the seriousness they deserve?

            For those who have always believed, I claim no discovery and my
       hope that it will be greeted as representing the first confrontation
       with a startling  new body of evidence  and  a  sense  of  what  the
       discovery has meant to those explorers who experienced it.

            To those for whom a devotion to truth and understanding bring a
       spark of life... welcome aboard the mother ship of mankind, built to
       bridge two worlds, which rode upon that cataclysm of old and bore us
       to our new beginnings.

                       INTRODUCTION to David Fasolds'  book

                                  The Ark of Noah

                                        by

                                  Charles Berlitz

       --------------------------------------------------------------------


                        Has Noah's Ark finally been found?

            The location  of  the  legendary Noah's Ark on Mount Ararat has
       been reported a number of times in  antiquity and the Middle Ages by
       such travelers as  Marco  Polo  and  other  merchants  and  pilgrims
       following the caravan  trails.  It  has been reported seen in modern
       times by mountain  climbers, shepherds,  fugitives,  and  explorers,
       religious and laic.

            Some climbers claim not only to have seen the  Ark  but to have
       touched it and even taken wood from the giant hull.  Since World War
       I it has  sometimes been sighted by aircraft pilots from military or
       private planes. It has been reported on the mountain in World War II
       and in the subsequent Cold War period.

            The problem  has  long been  how  to  positively  identify  it,
       inasmuch as climbers or viewers of Mount Ararat may be influenced by
       seeing something where  the  Ark  is supposed to be.    Pictures  of
       something which might  be  the  Ark  have  been  taken  from a space
       capsule at seven hundred miles altitude  over  the mountain, but the
       shape loses its cohesion when subjected to magnification.

            Other photographs  taken from planes seem to  have  been  lost,
       sometimes in mysterious circumstances. Further, photography from the
       air or on  the  side  of the mountain near the Russian border, where
       the Ark is supposed to be frozen most  of the time under the ice, is
       presently not only  difficult  but,  like reported photographs  from
       high-altitude spy planes such as the U-2, dangerous.

            When one  climbs to the upper reaches of Mount Ararat one risks
       being struck by lightning, falling  into deep crevasses through thin
       ice over glaciers, blown off the mountain by unexpected  winds,  hit
       by stone avalanches,  attacked  by wolves or wild dog packs, or shot
       by bandits or rebels.

            The dedication of the climbers, many of whom feel they are on a
       religious mission, is a definite manifestation  of  the power of the
       belief that Noah's Ark is waiting to be found on Mount Ararat.

            But the Bible never mentions Ararat specifically,  rather  "the
       mountains of Ararat,"  Ararat  being  a  form  of  the old word form
       Armenia-Urartu.

            The fixation upon Mount Ararat  itself  is  anciently  based on
       Saint Jacob's testimony. He said that an angel carried  him  up  the
       mountain to show him the Ark, and then took him down again.

                                      Page 7

            Explorers and  searchers  for  the Ark must face the element of
       popular disbelief in the very presence of such an artifact on Ararat
       as "How can you find something that dies not exist?"

            The popular legends concerning Noah's Ark, the enormous size of
       the ship allegedly built by Noah and  his  three sons, the gathering
       in and feeding of the horde of animals that were  summoned,  two  by
       two of each  species,  and finally, the illogicality of a flood that
       could cover the whole earth, may be based on the memories of a great
       flood but are certainly difficult  concepts  for  the nonbeliever to
       accept.

            But there  are  startling  indications  of a catastrophe  which
       affected the whole  earth ten  r eleven thousand years ago. This was
       a combination of  earthquakes, volcanic  eruptions,  cosmic  storms,
       sudden changes in sea level and climate.

            We are  now  able  to  ascertain  that  catastrophic   flooding
       occurred in different  parts of the earth as large areas of the land
       and water changed places. To many  of  the  earth's inhabitants, the
       world seemed to be drowning in a great flood, from  which only a few
       "chosen" people escaped.

            The legend of the Flood and the Ark is older then Greece, older
       then Egypt, older the Babylon and the cultures that preceded it. The
       memory of the  Flood, as this world disaster appeared to most of the
       ancient peoples inhabiting  the   earth   at  that  time,  is  still
       preserved in national and tribal traditions throughout the world.

            Only the  name  of  each local survivor varied  in  prehistoric
       northern Europe, East Asia, the American continents, Africa, and the
       Pacific.

            In the   ancient  Middle  East,  although  the  name  Noah  was
       antedated by other local names, the  story is the same. Noah's name,
       common to the great religions of Christianity, Judaism,  and  Islam,
       is now the most famous name among the ship captains who survived, as
       is the place of salvation - the mountains of Ararat.

            During the last few years, the search for the Ark of Ararat, on
       the high icy plateau, in crevasses, and even under the ice, has been
       intensified.

            The usual  pattern  for  searches  to  take place only on Mount
       Ararat has been changed by the exploratory  investigations  of David
       Fasold, a deep-sea  diver  and holder of a master's  ticket  in  the
       merchant marine.

            Fasold has   dedicated  years  of  his  life  and  considerable
       personal funds to long explorations  of  the  Ararat  area, with the
       premise that Noah's Ark has already been found.

            The true Ark, he claims, was photographed from  the air in 1959
       after a mud  slide  uncovered a stone formation closely resembling a
       ship.  This stone shape of a ship  is not on Ararat but twelve miles
       away on a lower range.

            The dimensions of the ship are almost identical to the biblical
       description of the Ark: approximately 450 feet, 75 feet wide, and 45

                                      Page 8

       feet high-except for  the  height-but the stone ship is still rising
       from the enveloping solidified mud.

            Fasold claims the stone form is a real ship, not fossilized but
       made of reeds covered with cement.   As we now know, cement was used
       thousands of years  before  Rome in different parts  of  the  Middle
       East.

            During his   year  of  on-the-spot  research,  Fasold  has  ben
       assisted by scientists who include  a  Los  Alamos  specialist and a
       radar field technician.  They  have  used the most  sensitive  radar
       devices that can  detect  formations  and  mineral content, not only
       under water but under land, up a depth of forty feet, as well.

            Starting with   frequency   generators   to   determine   metal
       concentration of spikes inside wooden beams, he traced thirteen bow-
       to-stern interior  divisions  and nine interior bulkhead-to-bulkhead
       supports.

            A more detailed search with subsurface interface radar revealed
       clear outlines of  closed sections, beams and cross beams, collapsed
       decks, iron and  other  metals   used   in   clamps,   and  pins  at
       approximately eighteen-to twenty-inch intervals.

            The discovery  of  the  inner  plan  of the stone  shape  of  a
       gigantic ship could  not  have been ascertained without digging into
       the shape except by using the subsurface radar.

            Here we have an example of advance technology revealing history
       that has not been generally accepted  as  such, obscured up till now
       by the mists of legend and time.

            The huge drag stones used on ancient ships have been found on a
       plateau several miles  away, possibly dropped there  when  the  ship
       started to go  aground.  The  Ark  survived  because  of  its cement
       covering and lay under layers of  frozen  mud  until  it surfaced in
       1948.

            The discovery of this stone ship and ongoing  tests  over,  and
       soon inside, the  vessel have created a world sensation, not only in
       archaeology but also in Middle East  politics  and  the study of the
       world's lost history.

            If this  is  indeed the Noah's Ark of the Bible,  its  complete
       appearance and identification  may  cause  many  to entertain somber
       reflections.

            Colonel James Irwin, an astronaut  who  walked  on the moon and
       who has long  searched  for  the  Ark,  has  expressed   what   many
       fundamentalists feel:

               "... the  finding  of  the  Ark  could  very well herald the
                return of the Messiah and the end of the earth."

            If the appearance of the Ark  is  a  warning, one must admit it
       comes at an appropriate moment in world history.

            The Turkish Ministry of Culture has now made  the  remains  the
       focus of a national park, and Turkish archaeologists, hopefully with

                                      Page 9

       international collaboration, will    continue   the   investigation.
       Meanwhile, a sign indicates the direction to the ship. It says:

                                   NUH'UN SEMISI
                                   (Noah's Ark).

            It is an interesting coincidence  and historic justice that the
       ancient ship, unrecognized  since 1948 by formal archaeologists  and
       religious searchers, should  finally  be  identified by a fellow sea
       captain - a professional colleague  and  ideological  descendant  of
       Noah.

                                  HOMO IGNORAMUS

                 Chapter 2 Pages 52 to 56 From David Fasold's Book

                                  The Ark of Noah


            There are other inconsistencies in the authorized  account that
       are easily explained  by  this  new sequence of events. The crow and
       the dove take on more significant roles and are explained in a later
       chapter.

            Where the olive leaf came from  which  obviously could not have
       drifted, taken root, and sprouted in only seven days and the purpose
       of the seven-day  wait between the sending forth of  the  dove,  the
       period of time  between the coming to rest and the ground being dry,
       is also answered by discovery of the drogue anchors.

            But could the idea of an earlier  period comprised of a shorter
       year be acceptable?

            Attempting to reconcile the pre-Flood ear and  that  period  of
       time shortly thereafter  with our present system of 29 1/2 day lunar
       months and a solar year of 365 1/4 days may not be realistic.

            Immanuel Velikovsky  compiled   vast   material   from  various
       cultures that concludes  there have been occasions of  perturbations
       in the vault of the heavens and the earth, during which the moon has
       receded to an orbit of 35 to 36 days' duration.

            The Flood  was  the result of an event that changed everything!
       Peter relates the ancients' understanding  that  for  the most part,
       the world is turning its back on today regardless of the evidence.

            For this they willingly are ignorant of,
            that by the word of God the heavens were of old,
            and the earth standing out of the water



                                      Page 10

            and in the water... But the heavens and the
            earth, which are now, by the same word are
            kept in store, reserved unto fire against
            the day of judgment...
                                                   2 Peter 3:5,7 KJV

            Are we  willingly  ignorant that the old heavens as viewed from
       our planet have passed away with  the  land  that was standing above
       the water of the prediluvian period?

            Portions of that landmass sank beneath the waters  and  through
       tectonic upheaval little  of the old world remains beneath our feet,
       while the heavens that are above us now in this new elliptical orbit
       of 365 1/4 days is reserved for a  future  time  when  it, too, will
       change.

            John speaks of this in a foreseen future event  when there fell
       great stones out  of the heavens preceded by an earthquake "such was
       not since men were upon the earth,  so  mighty an earthquake, and so
       great" that "every  island  fled  away, and the mountains  were  not
       found" (Revelation 16:18,20 KJV).

            Peter precedes  these  comments  by stating that we should know
       this first, that there shall come  in  the  last days of our present
       system scoffers, saying, "Where is the promise of  his  coming?  for
       since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from
       the beginning of the creation" (2 Peter 3:4 KJV).

            It is  here  that  Immanuel  Velikovsky begins to take a rather
       hard look at Homo Ignoramus.

            The sun  rises in the east  and  sets  in  the  west.  The  day
       consists of 23 hours, 56 minutes. The year consists  of  365 days, 5
       hours, and 49 minutes. The moon circles the earth's terrestrial axis
       points in the direction of the polar star.

            After winter  comes  spring,  then  summer  and fall. These are
       common facts, but are they invariable laws? asks Velikovsky.

            What single spectacle impressed  itself  upon  the  mind of man
       that evoked the astonishment of the survivors, but  a  change in the
       order of the universe, and it caused the Flood!

            Today, the willfully ignorant discredit traditions of upheavals
       and catastrophes by  the  shortsighted  belief  that no forces could
       have shaped the world we live in that are not now at work.

            In my opinion, this belief,  which  is  the  very foundation of
       modern geology, may have been a proud ship at her launching,  but it
       is now full of so many holes it doesn't float!

            There is no law of celestial mechanics that says the earth must
       have this particular  rate  of  rotation.    The  earth's equator is
       inclined to the plane of its elliptic at an angle of 23.45 degrees.

            This causes the change of the seasons during the earth's annual
       revolution around the sun. It is not  necessarily a general law that
       a planet must be so, and from my reading of the account  in Genesis,
       there had been a change.

                                      Page 11

            For the  theologian,  the reason for the Flood and the cause of
       the Flood are two entirely different matters.

            The mechanics of the event may  never  be fully explained as to
       an outside influence disturbing the earth, which caused the tilt and
       change in orbit, resulting in a total breakup of  the  crust,  or if
       the earth received  a  direct  impact,  as  the  Book  of Revelation
       predicts, it will in future form the star Wormwood.

            An immediate change in the atmosphere  is  noted by Noah at the
       first sighting of a rainbow and his mention of seasons  of  heat and
       cold.

            In the  years  thereafter  there appeared to be a decreasing of
       longevity, especially in the succeeding  generations,  and an abrupt
       change during the days of Peleg.

            The oldest  account of this phenomenon is recorded  by  Emperor
       Ho-ang-ti who, according   to   the   chronology  of  China,  was  a
       contemporary of Reu.

            In his medical book he proposed  an enquiry "whence it happened
       that the lives  of  our forefathers were so long compared  with  the
       lives of the present generation."

            All was  not peaceful on the earth when Noah stepped out of the
       Ark.  The readjustments of tectonic plates caused by the oblation of
       the earth at its new equatorial zones  since the axis shift may have
       still been causing havoc during later generations.

            If we are to accept the Masoretic text as accurate,  my figures
       would have Peleg  living  from 101 post-Flood to the year 340, but I
       have doubts as to this early date.

            Nahor, Terah's father, died  approximately  the  same  year, so
       there may be indications of another catastrophic event.

            Genesis 10:25  relates that during Peleg's day  the  earth  was
       torn asunder by a violent upheaval. He may have met his death during
       this event.

            Peleg's name  is  not  in  itself  a  proper  name. It means "a
       division." There are about thirteen  verbs translated "divide," each
       with a different shade of meaning.

            The popular explanation is that the world was divided among the
       various companies of  people  and  that  this  coincided   with  the
       dispersal from the Tower of Babel. If this was the meaning, the name
       is derived from palag "to divide by cleavage."

            The Egyptians,  too,  have recorded this event when the earth's
       crust was rent during Peleg's time  as  the work of the Lord (Thoth)
       Tehuti pens ta, "cleaver of the earth." During more  stable times he
       was remembered as Thoth-Hapi-Tem neb Xut, "Lord of the Horizon."

            This brings to mind Isaiah 24:1 KJV:

                 "Behold, the  Lord  maketh  the earth empty, and maketh it
                  waste, and turneth it upside  down, and scattereth abroad
                  the inhabitants thereof."
                                      Page 12

            Babylonian tablets  record  actual  dates  such as "the thirty-
       third day of the month" during that period.

            The abrupt decrease in longevity,  according  to  the Masoretic
       text, can be seen by the graph on the following page.

             In summation of this chapter, I am proposing  that  the  solar
       year prior to the Floor was undergoing a slow change, something that
       is alluded to  in  the study of the calendar at the Tiahuanaco ruins
       on the Alti Plano in South America,  which  in  my  view must now be
       considered the remains of a pre-Flood city.

            I have attempted to show that the solar year  of  the  Flood as
       described in the  Genesis  account  is  referring to a year of three
       hundred days.

            In the following chapter about the pre-Flood kings, my proposal
       coincides with the  biblical  account  of  the  reigns  of  the  Ten
       Patriarchs as listed in the Genesis account before the Flood.

            Could it be possible that the orbit of the earth  was disturbed
       by outside influences  passing  through  our solar system, causing a
       change in the earth's orbit around  the sun to an elliptic path of a
       longer year?

            Would the axis shift be a result of this disturbance,  or would
       the shift itself be the cause of the change?

            If all  things have remained the same, what then are we to make
       of the orbiting satellite, whose  distance  from  the  earth was 5.9
       terrestrial radii, that made 447 revolutions around  the  earth in a
       year ancient Americans?

            If the interpretation of these ancient calendars is valid, then
       perhaps we should  apply a shorter year to the pre-Flood accounts of
       the Mesopotamians.

            Here is a list showing the decline  in longevity from pre-Flood
       patriarchs through the post-Flood generation, finally  reaching  the
       life expectancy of today.

            The tradition  of  longevity  in ancient man is recorded by the
       following historians:

           Manetho,  Berosus,   Mochus,   Hestiaeus,  Hieronymus,   Hesiod,

            Hecataeus, Hellanicus,   Acusilaus,   Ephorus,   Nicolaus,  and

                                     Josephus.

       Vangard Notes >>>

          Is it not interesting how the lifespan of Man decreased so
            rapidly after the Flood, from 1000 years down to 70 ??
           It makes us wonder what happened after the Flood to cause
                  such a radical change in Mans' metabolism.
             Is it because of the loss of the "Amomum" or "youth"
              root of Noah, or perhaps because of something else
       which occurred to pollute the atmosphere or water of the planet,
          such as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah with what has
                 been suspected of being atomic explosions ??
