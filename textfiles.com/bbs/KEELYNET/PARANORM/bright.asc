                     Geological mystery lies deep below state

       Deep, very deep, in the heart of South Georgia, miles beneath the
       tiny crossroads town   of   Surrency,   lies   a  mysterious,  newly
       discovered geologic formation never  detected  anywhere  else in the
       world.

       Geologists say the "Surrency Bright Spot," nine miles beneath South
       Georgia's piney woods, may be an ancient reservoir of water or other
       fluid formed more  than  200 million years ago by the  collision  of
       North Africa and North America.

            "It's big,  and we've never seen anything like it before," says
             Dr. Larry Brown, an associate professor of geological sciences
             at Cornell University, who was  part of a scientific team that
             discovered the formation.

       Brown, a director of the Cornell-based Consortium for Continental
       Reflective Profiling (COCORP),  which  is  developing   a   detailed
       picture of the Earth's mantle, says the formation - "bright" only in
       terms of the  way  it  reflects  sound waves - is about two miles in
       diameter and appears to be shaped like a contact lens.

       If it is a subterranean pool of water or other fluid, it could force
       physicists to revise models of the  Earth's crust. Until now many of
       them felt the heat and pressure at those depths were  too  great for
       fluids to exist.

       Nine miles down, temperatures are nearly 500 degrees Fahrenheit and
       pressures are great  enough  to  flatten  the sturdiest truck like a
       pancake.

            "We really don't have a good idea what the object the formation
             is composed of," says Brown. "If it is water, it would upset a
             lot of scientific theories,  and  it would cause us to rethink
             our ideas  about  the  role  of water in forming  the  Earth's
             mantle."

       Brown says it might be a liquefied gas, such as carbon dioxide or
       methane, or something  more  exotic,  such  as liquid helium. But he
       says because of  the  tremendous pressure  and  temperature,  it  is
       probably not oil. Even if it were, it would be impossible to recover

       from such a depth, miles deeper than the deepest oil well.  Surrency
       Mayor Stanford Tillman,   first  informed  of  the  unique  geologic
       feature last week, has his own theory.

            "It might have something to do with Surrency's ghost," he says.
            "If this town is known for anything,  it's  for  the ghost that
             supposedly haunted the old Surrency house owned  by the family
             for whom the town is named during the 1870s and 1880s."

       Tillman says inhabitants of the house reported dishes flying off
       shelves, logs jumping  off  the  fire  and bricks coming through the
       walls.  The "ghost" became so famous that people rode the train from
       Atlanta just to see the "haunted"  house,  which  burned down at the
       turn of the century.

            "A lot of us also suspect that the goings-on had  something  to
             with unusual  magnetic  activities in our area," says Tillman.
            "The discovery of this object  formation  is  very  exciting to
             me."

       Brown's interest in the discovery is of a more scientific nature.
       The geologists were looking for the long-sought "suture" between the
       North African and North American continents when they  got the first
       hint of the  existence of a massive formation in 1985.  Recent tests
       confirmed the existence of the "bright spot," and Brown says details
       will be published soon in a scientific journal.

            "Finding the suture between  the  continents  was exciting, but
             the fact  that  we  found  this  bright  spot   is  even  more
             exciting," says Brown.

       The discovery is part of an ongoing effort to develop a detailed
       picture of the  Earth's  crust,  which  extends  20  miles below the
       planet's surface.  The scientists beam sound waves deep underground.
       When they are reflected back to the  surface, they are recorded on a
       graph, giving scientists an idea of the formations  far  below.  The
       system helped to  determine that the suture between North Africa and
       North America runs in a broad, gentle  arc  from  Brunswick  through
       Americus and on to the Alabama border.

       About 500 million years ago, the two continents collided, forming
       the Appalachian Mountains. When they pulled apart 180  million years
       ago, a piece  of North Africa remained lodged against North America,
       a continental fragment  that  now   is  beneath  Florida  and  South
       Georgia.  Sometime during that collision, geologists  say,  water or
       some other fluid  may  have  trickled deep into the zone between the
       continents, forming the Surrency Bright Spot.

       Vangard Note...

           We must  bring  up two interesting  points  in  regard  to  this
           article.

           The first  is  in  reggrd  to  the  Hollow  Earth  theory.   The
           observation was  that  it  was  9  miles  down,  at  500 degrees
           Fahrenheit and  (according  to  modern  theories)  subjected  to
           tremendous pressures.

           In regard to the Hollow Earth theory, specifically from the book

                                      Page 2





           "Etidorpha", mention is made of a shell of energy surrounding a
           central point.  This shell attracts on both sides (i.e. from the
           outside surface  towards  it and from the inside surface towards
           it). Matter  is aggregated from  space  and  from  within.   The
           sphere of energy is hundreds of miles in diameter  inside with a
           glowing sun  at  the  center.   Many  legends speak of caves and
           tunnels deep within the earth  leading to Shamballa and Agharta.
           These are  where the most advanced of the surface  dwellers  are
           sometimes invited   to  reside  with  the  inhabitants  who  are
           descendants of  devastated  cultures  such  as  the  Mayans  and
           Atlanteans.

           The point is that the book Etidorpha says that  there  are  many
           entrance points  leading  to  caves  and tunnels which go almost
           directly to this mirror image  of  the  surface.  These entrance
           points are many especially in the Southeastern  section  of  the
           USA.  At  one  point  in  the book, the travelers crossed a huge
           lake of very still water, since there was no wind to disturb the
           surface for the creation of waves.   An  unmoving  surface would
           interestingly enough  reflect sound waves much  as  the  article
           mentions.  Very  curious,  despite  the  incredulous reaction of
           those who refuse to look into such things.

           The second observation from this  article  is the mention of the
           "ghostly happenings" at the turn of the century.  Aside from the
           more likely probability of poltergeist activity (which in itself
           might be the same thing), could this not be the  actions  of the
           DERO which Richard Shaver and Ray Palmer wrote about in the 50's
           and  60's.  The DERO are the "evil twins" of the TERO.  Both are
           said to  be  descended  from a race of surface dwellers who were
           forced to  move  underground  when  the  Sun  began  giving  off
           radioactive and deadly radiation.

           However, the beneficent radiations emanating from  a  normal Sun
           soon caused  mutations  and  the spawning of the DERO.  The TERO
           were the  ones who managed to  remain  relatively  free  of  the
           mutations but  were  affected  by sickness and  loss  of  mental
           ability.

           When this  race  moved  underground, they took with them many of
           the advanced  machines which  were  developed  on  the  surface.
           According to Shaver, many of these devices still work though the
           devolved races have forgotten how to repair those  which  don't.
           Many of  the  machines are said to project rays which can affect
           the minds of people, teleport,  give  intense  pleasure or pain,
           cause levitation or movement from a distance, etc...   The  DERO
           delight in the use of such devices to torment surface dwellers.

           Of those  who  buy  the  SHAVER  story,  some think that the ray
           machines could explain some of  the  "ghostly  happenings" which
           have occurred  for  centuries  all over the world.   Who  knows?
           Possibly there  is a link with the article somewhere in all this
           smoke.
