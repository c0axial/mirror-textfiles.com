                a clipping taken from the LA Times, March 15, 1982

                            Ark of the Covenant FOUND??

       Tom Crotser, leader of a recent expedition to uncover the Ark of the
       Covenant, says his   find   has   been   supported  by  a  Jordanian
       archeologist.

       Samir Ghisan said he knows of the  corridor  on  Mount  Pisgah  that
       Crotser claims leads to the chamber containing the fabled Ark.

       Ghisan, now at  Loma  Linda University in California,  formerly  was
       regional director for the Museum at Madaba, Jordan.

       Crotser, of Winfield,  Kansas,  claims to have discovered the golden
       box (the Ark) that is said to contain  the original Ten Commandments
       and the Rod of Aaron.

       But he says he won't release his photographs until  he can show them
       to European financier  David  Rothschild,  who,  Crotser  says, will
       rebuild the Temple of Jerusalem.

       In the case of the Rod of Aaron, there are many references which all
       seem to be related to the original STAFF OF MOSES as found in Exodus
       and Numbers.  We  must  also  realize  that  Moses  and  Aaron  were
       brothers.

       Now there is specific mention of  the  STAFF  OF  MOSES.   It  is in
       Exodus where Moses first countenances God in the form  of  a Burning
       Bush.  At that  time,  Moses  is instructed to "take that STAFF, for
       you shall perform wonders with it."  The  staff is called the ROD OF
       GOD in its first occurrence.

       Moses complains that  he  is not the best choice to be the spokesman
       for the EVER-LIVING.  At this time,  God  instructs Moses to solicit
       the aid of  his brother Aaron, the Levite.  In another  verse  Moses
       says he is  slow  of  tongue, to which Pharoah will not listen.  The
       EVER-LIVING replies,

            "See, I will make you like a  GOD  to  Pharoah,  and Aaron your
            brother shall be your RECITER. "

            The EVER-LIVING  spoke  to  Moses and Aaron, saying,  -  "Since
            Pharaoh has said to you "Give us an Evidence (that your God has
            power and is thus real)",

            Instruct Aaron,  "Take  YOUR  ROD (GOD'S ROD now transferred to
            the control of Aaron in the function  of  high priest)and throw
            it down before Pharoah and it shall become a serpent."

       Then follows the ACTUAL meeting of Moses and Aaron with Pharoah.

            Moses and Pharoah therefore went to Pharoah,  and  did  as  the
            EVER-LIVING commanded,   and  he  threw  down  HIS  ROD  before
            Pharoah, and before his ministers, and it became a serpent.

            But Pharoah summoned the scientists and chemists, and they also
            did it, assisted by the engineers  of  the  Mitzeraim, by their
            delusions.

            For each  of  them  threw  down  THEIR  RODS! and  they  became
            serpents, but  the  ROD  OF  AARON  (now  GOD'S  ROD  is  fully
            identified as AARON'S ROD) swallowed their rods.

            The EVER-LIVING then said to  Moses,  "The  heart of Pharoah is
            decided not to let the people depart.  Confront  Pharoah in the
            morning, when he goes to the bath, and stand to meet him at the
            band of  the  river, and take the ROD which turned to a serpent
            in your hand.

            Then say to him, "The EVER-LVING GOD of the Hebrews has sent me
            to you to say, 'Let My People go and serve Me in the desert.

            But if you will not listen to  that, thus says the EVER-LIVING,
            by this you shall learn that I am the MASTER: -

            When I STRIKE WITH THE ROD which is in my hand  upon the waters
            which are  in the river, they shall turn to blood! And the fish
            which are in the river shall  die;  and  the river shall stink;
            and the Mitzerites shall loathe to drink of  the  water  of the
            river!"

            The EVER-LIVING  also  said  to Moses; "Say to Aaron; Take your
            ROD (note again God instructing  Moses  to instruct Aaron about
            the use  of HIS (AARON'S) ROD) and extend your  hand  over  the
            waters of  Mitzer;  -  over  the  streams, over the brooks, the
            pools, and over all the reservoirs  of  water;  and  they shall
            become blood; and they shall be blood in all  the  land  of the
            Mitzerites, both in wood and in stone."

       Again Pharoah refuses  to  allow  the  Hebrew  people to go into the
       desert to make sacrifice to the EVER-LIVING.

                                      Page 2





            Then the  EVER-LIVING  said  to  Moses,  "Command  your brother
            Aaron; 'Extend your hand WITH  YOUR  ROD  over  the rivers, and
            streams, and lakes, so that the frogs may come up over the land
            of Mitzer."

       Still Pharoah refuses,

            Consequently the  EVER-LIVING  said to Moses;  "Say  to  Aaron,
            'Extend YOUR  ROD, and beat the dust of the Earth, and it shall
            become lice in all the land of the Mitzeraim.'"  And he did so.

       Now comes an interesting turn of events,  Moses now takes command of
       the situation at   God's   instruction.   This  occurs   after   the
       affliction of boils.

            The EVER-LIVING  afterwards said to Moses, "Extend your hand to
            the skies, and there will come  hail  in  all  the  land of the
            Mitzeraim, upon man, and upon beast; and upon  all  that  is in
            the field, in the land of the Mitzeraim."

            So Moses  extended  HIS  ROD  to the skies, and the EVER-LIVING
            uttered His voice; and fire ran along the ground, and the EVER-
            LIVING poured hail upon the land of the Mitzeraim.

            And there was hail, and continuous  FIRE  mixed  with the hail,
            very cruel, such as had never been like it in  all  the land of
            the Mitzeraim from when it had become a nation.

       Pharoah begs that it be stopped wherein Moses replies,

            "When I  am  outside of the city, I will spread out my hands to
            the EVER-LIVING, WHEN THE VOICES  WILL CEASE, and the hail will
            not continue...."

       Next comes the plague of Locusts.

            So Moses  extended HIS ROD over the country of  the  Mitzeraim,
            and the  EVER-LIVING  drove  an  east wind over the country all
            that day and all the night until the morning came, and the east
            wind carried the locusts...

       Then comes the EXODUS wherein the Red Sea is parted.

            The EVER-LIVING then said to  Moses;  "Why  do  you  cry to Me?
            Command the children of Israel to march.  And  you,  RAISE YOUR
            STAFF, and  extend  your  hand over the sea, and it will divide
            itself, and the children of  Israel  can  go through it as upon
            dry land...."

       The people then  experience  the phenomenon of the  Mana,  which  is
       followed by a period of drought.  Here we come to the miracle of the
       water which comes from the rock...

            the EVER-LIVING  says  to Moses; "Pass along before the face of
            the people and take with you  the  Magistrates of Israel.  Take
            also in your hand THE ROD with which you shall  strike upon the
            rock, and water shall come out from it, and quench the people."



                                      Page 3





       Another mention is  made  of  the water being removed from a rock in
       Numbers.

       It is brought out after the children  of Israel are marched into the
       Wilderness of Tzin, where they settled in Kadesh.  Water in the area
       was deficient for the needs of the nation and the people  complained
       about the hardship induced upon them by the command of the Lord that
       they should move to such a barren wilderness.

            Then the EVER-LIVING spoke to Moses, commanding; -

            "Take your  STAFF,  and convoke the Parliament,  - you and your
            brother Aaron, - and command  the  rock  in their sight, and it
            will give  them water; and bring out water for  them  from  the
            rock, and quench the thirst of the people and their cattle."

            Moses therefore  took  his STAFF FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE EVER-
            LIVING, as he was commanded;  and Moses and Aaron addressed the
            crowd before the rock, and said to them ;

            "Listen now you rebels!  out of this very rock water shall come
            for you."

            Then Moses raised his hand, and struck the rock  with his staff
            twice, and a rush of water came out, and quenched the thirst of
            his people and of their cattle.

       God later instructs  Aaron  and  Moses  to ascend to the Peak of the
       Highlands, where Aaron removes his  robes,  and  clothes Aliazar his
       son with them, and Aaron died there on the top of  the  Peak.   Then
       Moses and Aliazar  came  down from the Peak.  And all the People saw
       the death of Aaron, all the house  of Israel; so they wept for Aaron
       for thirty days.

       As to the  tablets  of  the  Ten  Commandments,  the   Bible   quite
       specifically states that  the Ten Commandments are in the Ark of the
       Covenant.  It is interesting that  there were TWO sets, the first of
       which was destroyed  by  Moses  on  finding  his people  engaged  in
       blatant idolatry.

       This is shown by the following verse from Exodus,

            The EVER-LIVING afterwards said to Moses, "Cut for yourself two
            tablets of  stone,  LIKE THE FORMER ONES, and I will write upon
            them the  Commandments which  were  upon  the  FIRST  THAT  YOU
            BROKE..."

       The proof of that the tablets of the Ten Commandments are in the Ark
       are shown by  this  verse  from Deutronomy (the speeches  of  Moses,
       which form the  Moab  additions to the original Covenant made in the
       land of Horeb, this one being Speech XII before Moses dies).

            The EVER-LIVING says to Moses,  "Now  that  your  days approach
            death; summon Joshua, and station him in the Hall  of Assembly,
            and I will instruct him..."

       When Moses had finished engraving the commands of this Law (the Moab
       additions) in a  record  to  its  end,  he commanded the Levites who
       carried the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, saying;

                                      Page 4





            "Take this  Book of the Law, and place it INSIDE THE ARK OF THE
            COVENANT of the EVER-LIVING, your GOD, and it shall be there as
            a witness  to you, that I knew  your  rebelliousness  and  your
            stiff neck..."

       And the EVER-LIVING says to Moses,

            "Go up the hill by the ford, - to Mount Nebo,  and  survey  the
            land of Canaan, which I will give to the children of Israel for
            possession; and  you  SHALL  DIE  UPON  THE  MOUNTAIN  THAT YOU
            ASCEND, and be added to your people, as Aaron your brother DIED
            ON THE HILL OF HILLS..."

       We called Winfield, Kansas in the  hopes  of  locating  Tom Crotser.
       The operator says  no  one  by that name is listed  in  their  phone
       directory.

       The next step was to try Loma Linda University in San Diego.  A call
       was placed on  Saturday morning which amazingly enough was answered.
       A search of  the University directory  showed  no  GHISAN,  although
       there was an astronomer with a name something like Gazelle.

       We definitely plan to try the University again next week.  This file
       has been uploaded  to the ICJR BBS which is the direct  organization
       which is headed  by Mr. Vendyl Jones.  Vendyl is the man on whom the
       character "Indiana Jones" was modelled.

       Vendyl and his group have been actively searching for the Ark of the
       Covenant and the Ashes of the Red  Heifer  for many years now.  John
       Hill works with Vendyl and is the Sysop of the ICJR BBS, they are at
       1-817-346-1038 in Arlington, Texas.

       This is yet another interest of ours here at Vangard  Sciences.   We
       have several files  relating to these topics which currently include
       NOAHLAW, NOAHARK1, HEIFER1, INDY1 and now ARKCOV1 (this file).
