                       SPACE PROGRAM PROVES THE BIBLE RIGHT

               (Permission has been granted to reprint the following
          report by Mr.  Harold Hill, a consultant in the space program.)

       (Edited by Larry Turnage)

       "I think one  of  the most amazing things that God has for us today,
       happened recently to our astronauts  and  space  scientists at Green
       Belt, Md. They  were  checking  the position of the  sun,  moon  and
       planets with a computer program.

       It's imperative to  know these positions 100 and 1000 years from now
       so we don't have a satellite crash into something later on in one of
       it's orbits. We have to lay out the  orbits  in terms of the life of
       the satellites so that the whole program want bog down."

       "They ran the   computer  measurement  back  and  forth   over   the
       centuries, when suddenly  the  program  came to a halt and sent up a
       'red flag'. There was either something  wrong  with  the information
       fed into the  computer  or  with  the  results  as compared  to  the
       standards. They called  in  the  service department to check it out.
       They said they could find no reason  for  the  problem.  The head of
       operations said, 'What's wrong?'

       Well, they found that there was a day missing in  space  in  elapsed
       time. Everyone scratched  their heads and torn their hair. There was
       no answer!"

       "One of the chaps on the team was  a  Bible  student  and he finally
       remarked, 'You know,  once  when  I  was  in Sunday  School  it  was
       discussed that once in olden times the sun stood still.'

       Well, no one   would   buy  that  but  since  no  other  answer  was
       forthcoming someone finally asked,  'Show  us  where?.'   They got a
       bible and the religious chap went to the book of Joshua,  where they
       found a statement  that 'seemed' to be a pretty ridiculous statement
       for anyone to believe who had any 'common sense.'


                                      Page 1




       The Lord is  speaking to Joshua and says, 'Fear them not: for I have
       delivered them into thine hand: there  shall not a man of them stand
       before thee.'

       Joshua was concerned because he was surrounded by the  enemy  and if
       darkness fell they  would  be  overpowered  by a superior force.  So
       Joshua asked the Lord to make the sun stand still!

       That's right---'the sun  stood  still,  and  the  moon  stayed...and
       hasted not to go down about a whole day.'

       (Joshua 10:8, 12-13)  The  modern spacemen, said,  'Well  there's  a
       missing day alright.'  They  checked  the computers, going back into
       the time it was written and found  it  was  close to correct but not
       quite close enough.  The elapsed time that was missing  in  Joshua's
       time was computed  at  23 hours and 20 minutes---not a whole day, 24
       hours.  They reread the scripture  and  and  there  it  was---'about
       (approximately) a whole day.'"

       "These little words in the Bible are extremely important.  Yet  they
       were still in trouble because if you cannot account for 40 minutes ,
       you will be  in  trouble  in the future due to multiplication of the
       error many times over in the intervening years of mega-orbits."

       "This religious fellow once again  came  to  the  rescue and said he
       remembered somewhere in  the  Bible  where  it  said  the  sun  went
       BACKWARDS!  He was told he was out of his mind.

       Still they took  out  the  'Book'  once  more and found in II Kings:
       Hezekiah, on his death bed, was visited  by  the prophet Isaiah, who
       told him that he was not going to die.  Hezekiah  asked  for  a sign
       from heaven as proof.  Isaiah said, 'Do you want the sun to go ahead
       ten degrees?'

       Hezekiah said, 'It  is nothing for the sun to go forward 10 degrees,
       But let the shadow return backward 10 degrees.' (II Kings 20:9-11)

       Isaiah spoke to the Lord and the Lord brought the shadow 10 degrees
       backward!  This according to scripture.   Ten  degrees is exactly 40
       minutes!"

       "Twenty-three hours and twenty minutes in Joshua, plus 40 minutes in
       II kings makes 24 hours.  Twenty-four hours are missing  in  elapsed
       time!  The Space  travelers  had to log in the logbook that this was
       the missing day in the universe!"

       "Isn't that amazing?"

       October, 1970)
