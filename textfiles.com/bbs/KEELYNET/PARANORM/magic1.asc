                         A Partial History of Experiments
                in Occultic Practices and Religious Belief Systems

                                by Jerry W. Decker

       In my early  teens,  my  family  was  Pentecost.   As  I became more
       exposed to literature, science and  other  belief  systems,  I found
       myself asking why were we not allowed to do some things.   There was
       no logical reason presented.

       For instance, people  were  not  allowed  to  dance,  women were not
       allowed to wear  makeup and all were  forbidden  from  doing  things
       which either beautified or gave great enjoyment.

       I then attended  other  churches,  Baptist,  Protestant,   Catholic,
       Jehovah's Witnesses, Methodist, etc..and found similar but different
       prohibitions.  Again, no  congruency though many used the same bible
       as a source of guidance.

       Since the study of occultism seemed to be expressly forbidden by all
       of the versions of Christian faith  into  which  I looked, it seemed
       that investigation into this area might shed some light.

       This all congealed between the ages of 11 to 13. From  that point, I
       refused to attend  church of any kind unless I so desired.  It was a
       great problem at  first, but eventually  my  family  yielded  to  my
       refusals.

       My first field of study involved simple witchcraft.   This  included
       the verbalization of  spells  and  chants, candle-burning for mental
       concentration and focalization of  emotion.   Then  followed Voodoo,
       Romany/Gypsy magic and finally Ceremonial Magick.

       Of course, divination  in  the  form of cartomancy (cards),  scrying
       (crystal gazing), Tarot,    Ouija,    seances,    amulets/talismans,
       hypnotism, Hexerei (Pennsylvania  Dutch  hexes),  UFO's,  telepathy,
       astral projection and  other  metaphysical or unexplained  phenomena
       all came under investigation also.

       It might be  of  interest to recount some experiences which actually
       happened during the course of my investigations.

       On one occasion during my studies  in  hypnotism  at  about 14-15, a
       group of kids  and  I  were at a friend's house.  They  knew  of  my
       interests and just thought them weird.

       Dirk Blacksher was the friend who allowed me to use him as a subject
       for hypnosis.  He was not the only one, just the most spectacular. I
       brought him under and we tried various experiments.
                                      Page 1





       One suggestion informed  him  that he was in icy cold water at which
       his skin became cold, he evinced shivers  and  showed a mild version
       of chills.

       The next suggestion informed him that he was in a steamy hot area at
       which he began  to sweat.  This was followed by having  him  lift  a
       "balsa-wood" desk with  one  hand.   When he was conscious, he could
       only lift the desk with both hands  and under some degree of effort,
       hypnotized, it was effortless.

       We also did  the  pin-prick  test,  to which he showed  no  pain  or
       recognition on the insertion of the pin.

       His mother then  called  us downstairs to send him to the store.  We
       all went down with Dirk still under.   Of  course, everyone told his
       mother (Jan) that he was hypnotized at which she simply  laughed and
       began giving instructions as to what she wanted.

       When Dirk showed  no recognition of her and she could not awaken him
       (his eyes were open), she became mildly hysterical, demanding that I
       bring him out of it.

       After failing to  calm  her,  I brought  Dirk  out  by  a  backwards
       countdown to wakefulness.   He  remembered  nothing  of  the  entire
       episode.  My friends  and  I  were  elated  with  the experience but
       Dirk's mother had somewhat different feelings in the matter.

       She would not allow me to come to  their  house for almost 3 months.
       This included forbidding  her two sons from talking  or  associating
       with me.  We did so on the sly anyway.

       While studying Romany  (Gypsy) magic at about 15, I found mention of
       a god known as Jandra - God of Fire.   A friend, Randall Nail, had a
       reputation of being a major moocher.  He would also say things about
       people behind their backs and deny them when confronted.   Well,  he
       did this to me one too many times.

       It just so  happened  that  I  found  a spell calling upon Jandra to
       punish anyone who told lies behind  your  back.  This punishment was
       to take the form of sickness, though not specified  as  to what kind
       of sickness.

       Randall had a brother, Wayne, who was also a friend of mine.  I told
       him I was  planning  to  teach  Randall a lesson and test the Jandra
       spell at the same time.

       About 3 PM on a pleasant summer day, we went into an abandoned house
       and burned a newspaper in the kitchen  sink.  The fire was to invoke
       Jandra as a  fire  elemental  who  would then carry  out  the  spell
       against the perpetrator of the lies.

       After we finished  about  3:45,  we wandered around the neighborhood
       and endedup at  Wayne's house about  6:30  PM.   We  then  sat  with
       Wayne's family (mother, 2 brothers and a sister present) watching TV
       and talking.  Wayne's mother asked what we had been  doing and Wayne
       promptly told her about the casting of the spell.

       He then said  that  Randall was supposed to get sick if he told lies
       about someone.  She laughed as did  the  rest of the family and they
       kidded us about believing such nonsense.
                                      Page 2





       Well, about 7:30, we heard a strange noise outside the garage of the
       darkened house.  When it persisted, we turned on the porch light and
       found Randall leaning  against the garage and throwing up.  His face
       wa  very pale and he said he felt terrible.

       Randall's mother then gave me a very  mad  look and told me to leave
       and not come  back.  I was banned from visiting or associating  with
       them for over  2  months.  At school, we found that Randall had been
       with one of our other mutual friends.

       We asked that friend what had gone  on  and  he told us the lie that
       Randall had spoken  against me that afternoon after  the  spell  had
       been cast.  Coincidence?    Maybe   so,   but   a   most  gratifying
       experience, all in all.

       Another time, at about the age of  15, I was studying Voodoo.  There
       was a man who I did not like at the time.  I will not write his name
       or relationship as people still live who would be upset by this.

       The instructions called for a potato to be carved into  the shape of
       a human body.   A  witness  in  the  form of hair, spittle, sweat or
       other body material OR failing that, their signature or name written
       on a piece of paper OR a photograph.

       The term witness refers to a resonant link with the targeted object.

       I performed the ritual and consecrated  the  effigy  (the potato) in
       the victims name.  Pins were then stuck in the heart of the effigy.

       Up to this  time,  the  targeted  victim  had  no history  of  heart
       problems and was  in the peak of health.  I placed the effigy in the
       top of a darkened closet after completing the full ritual.

       No one was  told of this at the time.   About  two  weeks  later,  I
       answered the telephone and was told that this person  had suffered a
       critical heart attack.   He  had  mounted  a horse and seconds later
       fell off.  The doctor said he was dead before he hit the ground.

       I immediately ran to the closet and  took  down the effigy.  All the
       pins were removed  and  the  effigy was burned but  of  course,  the
       damage was done.  Needless to say, I was quite shaken.

       Later studies led  to true Ceremonial Magic using geometric patterns
       and the Names  of  Power.   Nothing   astounding   came  from  these
       experiments possibly because I could find no one to participate.

       Ceremonial Magic is difficult to perform alone, but  I did manage to
       carry out a  few  experiments.   The multiplication of psychic force
       comes from either blood sacrifice  and/or  the  addition of focussed
       thoughts and emotions as clearly specified in the Bible.

       Hexerei involved the  focussing  of  concentration   on  clouds  for
       dispersion or accumulation.   I  found  that I could make it rain or
       rain harder by intense concentration.  My boss, Mr. Dabbs and I used
       to bet that the rain would not get  worse.   I  won about 90% of the
       bets but sometimes at the expense of a headache.   This  was  at the
       age of 12-14.

       Another odd thing  happened  which borders on the witch's concept of
       the "familiar."  Familiars are spirits,  elementals  or  demons  who
       assist the witch to carry out their activities.

       Compensation comes from psychic energy or a direct  drain  of  blood
       through an appendage  known as a "witches tit".  This tit is said to
       most commonly be located under the  left  armpit, although it can be
       anywhere on the body.  The familiar suckles from the  tit  to absorb
       lifeforce in the form of blood.

       As a further  point  of  interest,  there  is another type of demon,
       sometimes helpful, sometimes disastrous,  known  as  the  incubus or
       succubus.  These creatures come in the night to absorb the lifeforce
       which is carried in sexual fluids.

       They intentionally excite the victim to the point of ejaculation.  I
       have not personally experienced this particular type  of  entity.  I
       believe incubi are male and succubi are female.

       Although I never  had such an appendage as a witches tit, I did have
       a strange experience in the form  of  a  crow as a pet.  This animal
       might have been likened to a familiar though in truth, I don't think
       he was.

       My brother and   I   used   to   sell   Christmas  cards,   magazine
       subscriptions and things of that nature door-to-door.  About the age
       of 12, I went to the house of Mrs. Wallis and while talking with her
       I heard a  strange noise.  On inquiring what that was, she showed me
       a crow in a bird cage which she said  had  been stealing pecans from
       her pecan trees.

       One thing led to another and I convinced her to give  him  to me.  I
       promptly clipped his  wingtips  and  named him Bill.  My brother and
       sister were interested but not as fascinated as I with the bird.  He
       seemed to be extraordinarily intelligent  and his eyes sparkled with
       mischief.

       Once he trusted me, I let his wings grow to their fullness  and  let
       him loose in  the  house.   That  was  followed by a tether outside,
       which later was discarded.

       Bill stayed on top of my grandmother's  house  and would come when I
       called.  He would be high in the sky and I could hold up my forearm,
       pat it and call "Come Bill" and he would swoop down  and  land on my
       arm.

       At that time,  I was in the 5th and 6th grade and had bought a Vespa
       motorscooter from Sears.  Bill would  fly over me wherever I went in
       town or country.  The neighborhood kids thought it  wonderful  and I
       enjoyed him immensely.

       We lived one  half  block  from  school  and  Bill would come to me,
       flying over the playground at recess.   He  then  somehow located my
       classroom and would  land  on  the  sill and march  back  and  forth
       wanting in.

       Mrs.  Storm would finally ask me to please remove my pet, at which I
       had to go  outside  and  explain to him that he must not disturb the
       class.  He would not repeat this for some time after.

                                      Page 4





       The strange part  about this crow was that he learned to talk! I did
       not believe it at first until the  neighbor  kids  told  me they had
       heard him talking.

       My brother and  sister and friends used to sit on  my  grandmother's
       porch during the  summer  and  eat watermelon and candy.  Bill would
       sit on the fence and watch us.

       We would throw him a chunk of melon  which  he  would catch and eat.
       Sometimes we would give him candy which he liked very much.

       One day we  were eating candy in the form of a cinnamon  cube  on  a
       stick and Bill  was  obviously  wanting  to try that.  I broke off a
       small piece and gave it to him.

       He ate it and shook his head during the process.  After he finished,
       I noticed blood in his mouth and around his beak.

       He then flew off and was gone for  several  days.  When he returned,
       nothing appeared to be different and I inspected his mouth which was
       now perfectly healed.

       About two weeks later, my friends told me the bird could talk.  This
       sounded too impossible, so I just laughed and said so.

       One Saturday morning  the week after hearing this,  I  was  sleeping
       late and heard someone outside call "Jerry, come out and play!"

       I thought it  was  one of the kids from the Wright family and stayed
       in bed.  The neighborhood kids would  say  this phrase whenever they
       came over during the summer or the weekends during school.

       After hearing this several times, I noticed it sounded strange, kind
       of tinny or mechanical.  I opened the door and no one was around.

       This time I clearly heard the mechanical voice say, "Jerry, come out
       and play!" and it came from the roof.  I stepped  outside  and  Bill
       peeked over the edge of the house.

       I then called  him  down  and  tried  to coerce him to speak while I
       watched.  To my knowledge, he never  spoke  when he knew someone was
       watching.

       The local vet told me that birds which don't normally  talk could be
       made to do  so  by slitting their tongue.  He said this is what must
       have happened with the sharp edge of the cinnamon candy.

       Needless to say, I gained somewhat  of  a  reputation in my hometown
       during that time.   The  bird  simply added to the  mystique.   Bill
       disappeared after about 2 years and was never seen again.

       My sister knew  of  my  magical experiments and we talked about love
       potions, spells and philtres.  She was interested in this one guy in
       school and he would not even pay her  any  attention.  Well, I did a
       spell for her using candle-burning techniques.

       Within the next  two  weeks,  she was dating the guy.   I  did  this
       several times and  was  always  amazed at the success of the ritual,
       particularly since it did not involve  me getting emotionally worked
       up for the psychic discharge.
                                      Page 5





       I can only assume that it had something to do with elementals, since
       it used the  flame of a colored candle (orange for love, not red for
       lust).  The fire elemental was "emotionally  flavored"  by the color
       of the candle and the text content of the operational spell.

       Another quite interesting experience occurred while  I  worked  as a
       cook at a truck stop on the night shift.  This was after high school
       about the age of 21.  I knew most of the waitresses quite well.  One
       waitress named Maureen  was  desparately  in  love with a driver who
       lived in Fort Worth and came through about once per week.

       Maureen had suffered some problems and I liked her so several times,
       I would take them into the country  for  a rendousvous and pick them
       up later.

       The guy would not commit to marrying her even though  he was free to
       do so.  It was really hurting Maureen emotionally.

       Well, Maureen knew of my early experiments and had discussed some of
       the successes with  my  sister.  She asked me to do a love spell for
       her and this guy.

       I informed her that I would rather  teach  her  how to do it and let
       her own energies  and  obviously powerful emotional  attachments  be
       directed to accomplish her ends.

       Anyone who has  looked  into  magical  practices, either low or high
       magic, should be aware that your instruments are a psychic extension
       of yourself.

       Once they have been consecrated,  they  become  attached to you as a
       wire to a power source.  This warning is repeated over  and  over in
       authentic magical treatises.   The  idea  is  that you MUST NOT LOAN
       YOUR MAGICAL INSTRUMENTS TO ANOTHER.   If  you do so, then they have
       full control of your psychic energy with your full consent.

       Well, my instruments were consecrated and used ONLY  by  me  over  a
       period of several  years and with modest success.  Each use added to
       the overall psychic charge of the instruments as well as "tuned" the
       instruments to my energy field.

       Maureen did not have the money to buy her own and so coerced me into
       loaning her my instruments.  Against my better judgement, I gave her
       written instructions and the instruments.

       I heard nothing from Maureen in the  next few weeks.  About one week
       after the loan of the instruments, I became extremely ill.

       I came down with a major fever, loss of appetite and  energy and was
       TOTALLY BEDRIDDEN for  almost  seven  days.   During  that period, I
       could only drink water and sleep.   I  went  from  205 pounds to 180
       pounds!  It was as close to DEATH as one could come.

       After the seven  days,  I  began to be able to eat  again,  but  had
       massive weakness due   to  the  atrophying  of  muscles  during  the
       illness.

       One night about two to three weeks after the illness, I saw Maureen.


                                      Page 6





       She told me  she  had  carried  out  the  candle-burning ritual as I
       instructed and would return my instruments within the next few days.

       About a week after that, I got a phone  call from Fort Worth, it was
       a very ecstatic Maureen.  She told me she was now married to the guy
       and that my equipment was at her mother's house.

       ONLY THEN did I realize what had happened.  Her successful use of my
       magically consecrated instruments had absorbed so much  energy  from
       my system that I became deathly ill.

       It could only  be  so,  since I had ABSOLUTELY NO KNOWLEDGE that she
       had carried out the operation OR achieved  such a resounding success
       at my expense.

       On retrieving the  instruments,  I destroyed them  and  performed  a
       banishing ritual to  dissolve  any  lingering  patterns.  I have not
       performed candle-burning since that  time, though I would do so if I
       felt it necessary.

       After the Voodoo  experience,  I still tried minor  experiments  but
       nothing aimed at  harming anyone.  There is no doubt in my mind that
       there will be repercussions somewhere in my future experiences.
       The Law of  Compensation (or Retribution)  cannot  be  cancelled  or
       ignored.

       Science fiction had  also been of interest and it  is  here  I  came
       across the Hieronymous Box in a story by Campbell.

       Once I found  that  a  picture  could  be  taken of the person to be
       affected, placed in a machine and  tuned to that person's body field
       to pick up or transmit patterns, I felt that was the best way.

       From there, science  was  the  predominant  ruler with  a  secondary
       interest in religion,   magic   and  metaphysics.   There  are  many
       relationships as one can see when  studying multiple disciplines.  I
       always remember that "Magic is Science of a very high order."

       In my studies,  I  found  many things which Christians  believe  yet
       which have no  basis  in fact.  Modern Christians are so polluted in
       thought that they can only resort  to one source of information, the
       King James bible.

       I have found  that  particular  version  to be so corrupted  through
       mistranslation, miscopyings and  intentional distortions that anyone
       who uses it as the sole basis for  discussion self-cancels their own
       "stated beliefs."

                 NO ONE has the right to TELL YOU WHAT TO BELIEVE!

               NO ONE can tell you that you will "go to Hell" if you
                     do not believe their particular ideology!

               ANYONE who tells you such things or forcibly attempts
             to coerce you by such threats is not worthy of your time.

                              Walk away, dissociate!

                         You must discover your own truth!

       I recommend that  you  consult the widest possible range of sources,
       collate what matches and that which you feel most comfortable with.

       Only after you have done all that  you can to find the truth on your
       own, then ask for guidance.

                      That guidance should come from within.

       The "tele-evangelists" are   the  most  despiccable   of   the   new
       preachers.  They use  the very powerful form of television to elicit
       funds for their own use.  When one looks at any video screen, within
       a period of  30  seconds, the person  enters  a  state  of  alpha  -
       acceptance to input.  This is how many people get "hooked"  on  this
       bullshit which these people flavor to their particular whims.

       People are allowing  themselves  to  be  subjected  to  mind control
       techniques which are further detailed  in  the  MIND1 to 4 series on
       KeelyNet at 214-324-3501.

       In time, the simple Law of Compensation will pay back  these people,
       but look at  the  damage they will inflict in the meantime.  Look at
       what happened to Bakker, Roberts and Swaggart.

       The Catholic church uses the concept  of  guilt with the requirement
       that you MUST  ask  forgiveness in the form of intervention  from  a
       properly authorized human (priest).

       Of course, churches  and  priests must have support from the tithes.
       This is true  for all organized Christian  religions  which  I  have
       encountered.

       In the first few hundred years of this millenia, Anno  Domini, there
       were three truly   advanced   groups   which   the  Catholic  church
       completely destroyed.  The  Albigensians,   the   Cathars   and  the
       Gnostics.

       What was the  primary "heresy" which these groups committed  against
       the Church?  The  simple  belief that prayer is something to be done
       in private.  Communion with the EVER-LIVING is to be done by you and
       you alone, without the presence of others to see your belief.

       The best source for this guidance  is  from  the  book of Matthew as
       follows,

                                    How To Pray

            "And when  you  pray,  do  not  follow  the   example   of  the
             hypocrites; for  they  delight  to pray STANDING IN THE CROWDS
             and at the corners of the squares, SO THAT THEY MAY BE SEEN BY
             MEN.

            "I tell you, however, that they  receive their wages.  But when
             YOU pray, enter your chamber, and having shut  your door, pray
             to your  Father  in that privacy; and your Father, seeing into
             that privacy, WILL RETURN TO YOU OPENLY.

            "But when praying, make use of NO BABBLE, like the heathen; for
             they imagine that they will  be  listened  to because of their
             volubility (great flow of words).

            "Do not  therefore  imitate  them;  for  your Father knows your
             necessities BEFORE YOU CAN ASK HIM.

       Being an AGNOSTIC (one who believes  it  impossible  'at present' to
       KNOW that GOD  exists,  the proof is not all in), I  don't  consider
       myself to be "religious".

       From the many  things  I have seen and experienced, there is without
       doubt some greater power and many lesser powers.

       The closest analogy  I  can  find   is  that  of  the  gestalt  -  a
       combination of smaller  energies  to  yield  a  far   greater,   yet
       functioning as one,  single  energy.  Therefore, we are all cells in
       the mind of GOD.

       To me, the  closest  thing to making  sense  is  that  of  the  Huna
       philosophy of the  ancient  Hawaiians.  They follow  a  very  simple
       teaching,

                                  "Hurt No One."

                   For my own practices, I have modified that to

                            "Hurt no one, WITH INTENT."

       This paper is  being  placed  on  KeelyNet  for two purposes, to let
       people know that there is without  doubt  in  my mind, MAGIC, and to
       show that there   are  other  ways  of  acquiring  information   and
       understanding.

       Science can be  "organic" and juicy, not dry and sterile.  The files
       on KeelyNet show that there are EXCITING  things  coming.   We  have
       made many contacts with others who see the truth of  this  and share
       information as we do.  Thank you for listening..........Jerry
