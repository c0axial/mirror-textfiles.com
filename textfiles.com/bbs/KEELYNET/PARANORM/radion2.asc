       After following the  previous  column  of  mine  introducing  you to
       'Radionics' I am sure many of you  who  completed the experiments in
       that column have many questions about Radionics.

       In order to  establish  an  operating  basis  for   discussion   and
       experimentation, I feel  it  is  necessary  to  include  a  list  of
       retailers that can furnish you with  the  materials that will enable
       you to discover for yourself the 'miracles' of Radionics.

       So I have compiled a list of retailers for you below.

       This is a small list of merchants that carry materials and books on
       Radionics. This list is by no means complete...there are undoubtedly
       other places where you can recieve these materials.

       I am not  affiliated  with  any  of these merchants,  so  I  am  not
       recieving any financial  'Kickbacks'  from  them...  These  are just
       sources that I have uncovered in  the  past  year  or  so  that have
       proven to be 'reliable'.

       I have tried  to  include  all  the  essential information  on  each
       supplier.

       HEALTH RESEARCH, Box 70, Mokelumne Hill, California.95245

           This is a fine source to find books that are nolonger in print.
           They sell BY MAIL ONLY, they DO NOT have a walk in store.
           Their catalogs  were  once  free  but  they  now charge for them
           (refundable upon purchase). Catalogue  1-A is for Health Books &
           Associated Subjects.

           It's price is $2.00. Catalogue 2-A is for Occult, Metaphysical &
           Religious.
           It also is $2.00. Each catalogue is approximately 100-200 pages.
           It is  well worth the $2.00. Many other fine features  from  the
           business make  it  a  worthwhile  experince..Highly reccomended.
           Both catalogues   together   costs    $4.00....(refundable    on
           purchase).
           (Catalogue 1-A is the catalogue for books on Radionics etc.)
           You may also just request a flyer on their Radionics books (free
           of charge), just include a SASE* and tell them  you  would  like
           more information about radionics.

           Active R  &  D  has  many  of the more 'time honored'  radionics
           devices for  sale,  along  with  several  'new' devices that are
           superior to the 'older generation'  models.  They sell Plans for
           the devices  as  well as the allready assembled  'black  boxes'.
           Newsletters are  also  available  to  stay  'up  to date' on the
           latest discoveries and develpoments.
           Their catalog is $1.00, complete  with diagrams and descriptions

       LOR'D INDUSTRIES LTD.  Box 14511, West Allis, WI. 53214-0511

           This is  a  mail  order book store for books on the 'unusual' as
           well as an outlet for Radionics devices. They sell many of the

                                      Page 2





           'traditional' radionics  devices  as  well as the ELF (Extra Low
           Frequency) Generators.
           Service through this outlet was  rather  slow  and  tedious, but
           this supplier  explained  to me that they assemble  the  devices
           themselves and  sometimes  that  have  a 'back log' of orders on
           hand, so please be patient with this supplier.
           Send $1.00 for their 'Alpha....and  beyond' catalog. It has most
           of their books as well as their devices listed inside it.

       LIFE UNDERSTANDING FOUNDATION.  Box 30305, Santa Barbra, CA. 93015

           This is  a  outlet  that  deals  exclusively with  Pyramids  and
           Pyramid energies. If have have been curious about the aspects of
           pyramid energies...  this  supplier  has  all  that  you need to
           perform experiments with pyramids. This is a simple and easy way
           to get yourself oriented in the  use of pyramids. They also sell
           books on the subject. As far as I know, the catalogue  is  free.
           But postage  isn't....  so send a SASE to them, or send 50 cents
           to cover postage and handling.

       As more supplier/retailers of Radionic and Psychotronic devices
       become know to me I will update this list from time to time. But for
       now, these retailers have all that is needed to explore the 'new'(?)
       science of Radionics. Hope this list is helpful for you.
