       The story of Vendyl Jones

       Vendyl M. Jones,  a  native of Sudan, Texas, has been excavating the
       Caves of Qumran beside the Dead Sea for over twenty years.

       Vendyl and his Jewish wife, Zahava,  live  in  Qiryat Bialiq, Israel
       and have their  U.S.  Office  in  Arlington, Texas.  He  holds  both
       American and Israeli  citizenship  although  he  is  a Christian and
       holds degrees in Divinity and Theology.

       In 1977 Randolph Filmore, a free  lance  journalist  volunteered  to
       work at Jones' Qumran Excavation. He wrote a script  about Jones and
       the excavation "In Search For The Ashes of The Red Heifer."

       The script came  out  in  the form of the movie "Raiders Of The Lost
       Ark" with another "Indiana Jones."

       "That is a great movie," says Vendyl.  "The  main difference is that
       the show was really a drag as compared to our excavation.  More than
       anything else, that was `fiction' while our excavation is fact."

       In April, 1967,  Vendyl moved his late wife, Lois, and five children
       to Israel so  he could enroll in  Hebrew  University  Department  of
       Jewish Studies.

       His studies were interrupted in June '67 by the Six  Day  War.  June
       16, 1967 issue of TIME magazine featured Jones "as the only American
       to fight with the Israeli Army."

       Though color blind,  he  volunteered  as a forward observer and in a
       matter of minutes on the front lines he spotted four Jordanian anti-
       personnel bunkers and sixty-six anti-tank  bunkers  that the Israeli
       Army had not seen.

       "I had a ring-side seat for half the duration of the war --- three
       days." He also served in the 1982 conflict in Lebanon.

       He remains active in high tech Israel defense projects,  but refuses
       to discuss their particulars.

       The Israeli Government  commissioned Jones to do a texts information
       for the Israel tour guide course at  Hebrew  University. The project
       was extended to  his being appointed as Southwest  Director  of  the
       Government Tourist Office  to  develop  college  consortium programs
       between the Americans  and Israeli  universities  in  archaeological
       excavations in the Land.

       Jones is considered  as  a  foremost authority in Judaism as well as
       the geography, history and archaeology  of  the  Land  of Israel. In
       addition to his studies in Judaica at Hebrew University,  he studied
       in the Lubervitchur  Chabad  Yeshiva  and in Beit Kabballah, the two
       most Orthodox Rabbinic schools in Israel.

       He pioneered the concept of Covenant  Plurality  which has of recent
       been accepted in  three  major  denominations. "Covenant  Plurality"
       says Jones, "is  very  simple. You simply interpret the Bible in the
       plain, ordinary, simple and normal  meaning  of the words. Don't add
       unstated meaning or `spiritualize' the passages.  Define  the  words
       based on the root of the original tongue.

       Interpret the words  based  on  the hermeneutical principles of each
       particular level. Do not conjure  theological  expressions  into the
       text that are not stated.

       If one follows these principles he will conclude that every covenant
       God made with mankind is eternal and as valid today  as  when it was
       spoken."

       "Jesus did not  alter  one  jot  or  tittle of the Law and Prophets.
       Therefore, the church had no right  to do so four centuries later as
       the Byzantine church fathers did. Nor do we have the  right to do so
       today. If Jesus  did not change it, theologians have no authority to
       do so."

       "Covenant Plurality" means, that when  God makes a deal He keeps it,
       and he did not put all his eggs in one basket.
