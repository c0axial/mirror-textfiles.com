       Vangard Notes >>>

             In 1948, an earthquake in Turkey disgorged the remains of what
             is believed to be the original Ark of Man - Noahs' Ark.

             A military  overflight taking photographs of the landscape for
             reconaissance purposes noted a strange new pattern in the form
             of a giant ship.

             David Fasold, an ex-Merchant  Marine  and amateur archeologist
             heard stories  about  the Ark and became intriqued  with  this
             particular one.   After  years  of  research  and  spending in
             excess of $150,000 of his own  money, David has confirmed that
             this is the true ARK of Noah.  A book is currently  out,  "The
             Ark of Noah", published in 1988 by Wynwood Press of New York.

      ü      The ISBN  number is 0-922066-10-8 and it can  be ordered from
             most book   suppliers   such   as   Taylors   or  Waldenbooks.
             David tells us it is soon to come out in paperback.

             The hardback version sells for $18.95.

                     BUY IT, you will not regret the purchase!


             Mr.  Fasolds' discovery of the  ARK of Noah has  been verified
             by some of  the  top  scientists  in the field.  Mr. Ron Wyatt
             from Madison,  Tennessee  one  of  the   top scientists in the
             country on sub-surface radar  research,  Dr.  John Baumgardner
             from  Los  Alamos  research     center,   Mr.   Vendyl   Jones
             (A.K.A.  Indiana  Jones)., and many others  who  we  will  not
             list.

             David makes  no  claims  as to actually  discovering  the Ark.
             He rediscovered it after many other researchers had pronounced
             the site  as not the remains  of  a  ship,  but  a  geological
             formation.

             The true  discoverer  of  the  Ark is a Turkish  farmer  named
             Reshit Sarihan.   An   earthquake   occurred   in  1948  which
             shifted  the  ground  where  the  Ark  had  rested  all  these
             centuries.

             At that   time,   not  much notice was taken  of  the  exposed
             shape until  a  military photo reconaissance  overflight  took
             pictures which showed the shape of a very large ship.

                                      Page 1





             However, David  did  make  the  contacts  and   do   the quite
             incredible amount   of   research   necessary  to  locate  and
             verify his site as the TRUE ARK of NOAH.

             He has spent over $100,000 of   his own money and in excess of
             6 years  on   the   ARK   project.    We  consider   ourselves
             extremely fortunate  to   have   been  allowed  to meet such a
             fascinating and capable researcher  as  David   Fasold.    His
             work  is currently unappreciated and not even suspected by the
             masses.

             It seems   orthodox  Christianity MUST FIND  THE  ARK  ON  THE
             MOUNT OF   ARARAT  TO  VERIFY  THEIR  FAITH.   In  truth,  the
             translations in the Bible have  been  so  in  error  that many
             people searching for these wonderful historical treasures have
             been led astray.

             The primary  problem  has been their failure to  consult other
             ancient texts  concurrent  with  the  event.    Corruption  of
             records takes  on  an  almost  logarthmic  certainty  as  time
             passes.

             Each ruler  wants  history   to   begin  with  him or to alter
             past history to his views.

             This is one of the things we  most  admired  about David, his
             tenacity and his wide ranging research efforts.   He consulted
             dozens of  texts  including  the  Torah, the  Koran,  the Epic
             of Gilgamesh  and  many  others  to  piece  together  the true
             location.

             David visited with us in October  of  1989 in Dallas.  We were
             with him  on several occasions while he lectured  with  Vendyl
             Jones at   various   engagements   around  the  country  using
             Arlington (Vendyl's home) as a base.

             David is so fascinating that  we had to have a mini meeting of
             interested friends  and  associates  to  share   some  of  his
             experiences.  He  brought  with him maps, 2 pieces of the ARK,
             many photographs and some videotape  of  his  discovery.   The
             pieces of the ARK were most interesting as  they  were  almost
             petrified wood  with  highly  oxidized  iron fragments.  David
             said these came directly from the ARK site.

             David has  been  working  in   conjunction  with  the  Turkish
             government to arrange summer tours for those who might wish to
             visit the Noah's Ark site.

             If you  ever get a chance to hear  him speak  or  to  meet  or
             speak with  him,  DON'T  PASS  IT  UP!   He will hypnotize and
             enthrall you with his anecdotes  and  the  recounting  of  his
             discovery of  the ARK.

             I -   Jerry   Decker,   had  the  privilege of  attending  the
             1989 International Geophysical Symposium  as a guest of
             Vendyl Jones and David Fasold.

             Both gave   presentations   which   simply   mesmerized  these
             Engineers and Scientists from all over the world.  It was

                                      Page 2





             truly amazing  to  see   how  these  people  very  technically
             oriented clustered  around   both  David  and  Vendyl  to  ask
             questions about their archeological researches.

             Another thing that David has  noted  which  we  all find very
             interesting is that the day of the earthquake  in  1948 is the
             same date   that   Israel   became   a   nation,  just  as  in
             Biblical prophecy!

             David found   an  interesting  Egyptian  myth  which tells the
             story of how the Moon was coerced  into  sharing  some  of its
             light.  In  fact,  it had to do with a slowing   down  of  the
             Earth's rotation   which,  since   it  is  a  giant  armature,
             necessarily reduced  the magnetic field.

             Zecharia Sitchin's    excellent    books    also   give   many
             translations relating to events in pre-dawn times.

             Also why  did  people live such  long life spans  as  compared
             with people  of  today.  Is it possible that the slowing  down
             of the Earth's rotation  caused   a change in the human body's
             electric field due to the decreased magnetism?

             Is this why the Dinosaurs died out?

             Or could  it  be that one who had eaten of the  "AMOMUM"  root
             (the root of Youth) as mentioned in the Epic of Gilgamesh:

                    " Its name is The Old Will Be Made Young. "

                      I too will eat it, and I will return to
                             What I Was In My Youth."

                  ( These are some of the questions into which we of
                    Vangard Sciences are interested and looking into.)

              Mr. Fasolds'  book can be purchased  at  any  book  store  or
              you can write to him.

                        N O A H ' S    A R K   U P D A T E

       We have been in communication with Dave Fasold. He has sent some
       very interesting information. Following is a letter and selective
       comments. I want to thank Dave for his support and encouragement.

       12/14/89

       Dear Dave and Sandra,

       Rushing this off to you as promised, as I have a busy schedule this
       weekend.  Have to go up to LA and do some voice overs for the PBS
       film which looks like MARCH airing.  Also meeting with two tour
       companies for the Ark trips and both want exclusive!

       Enjoyed your latest  GAP  and  keep  it  up.  I'll  try  to write on
       something else next time. Wearing  my  Tennessee T-shirt proudly and
       thinking of you both. Keep researching....edit away at my article!

       Your shipmate aboard the mother-ship,

       Well it's that time of year again folks. The perennial seeding
       of Mount Ararat with sightings of the Ark left to germinate over
       the long winter months.

       For those Boob-Tube  Believers  who  like  to split  their  offering
       between the Fund-O-Faith Growth and Income Network and the Cathedral
       of Reciprocity looking  forward  to their Seeds of Faith Multiplying
       into getting that cruise and Mercedes,  it  may  not leave much left
       over to support the Ararat Groups in their yearly mountian  climbing
       v cation at Christendom's  expense,  but that's what they are crying
       for again.

       The latest sighting was announced  in  the  TURKISH DAILY NEWS under
       the headline of "Turks angered by Americans' claim  of  discovery of
       the Ark."

       ANKARA- Agri Governor  Rasim Bas and a Turkish scholar exploring for
       the legendary Noah's Ark disputed,  Friday,  claims by two Americans
       that they have discovered Noah's Ark on the southside  of Mt. Ararat
       in eastern Turkey while flying over it in a helicopter.

       "What the two  said  to reporters have no connection whatsoever with
       science and have  no scientific value,"  the  angry  governor  said,
       adding that it was impossible to announce a discovery only by taking
       photographs and flying over a region.

       What had Church Aaron, the pilot said? Aaron said, "We are 100% sure
       this is the Ark."

       Atatuck associate professor   Salih   Bayraktutan,   who   heads   a
       commission exploring Noah's Ark said the sole "scientific data" at
       hand shows that remains at the Uzengili village (my site) which
       have been place under state protection were the remains of the Ark.

       He said the physical findings and scientific report on the issue
       will be published in 1990.    Bayraktutan went on to say that
       "Americans were trying to prove the variability of the Holy Bible

                                      Page 4





       against the Holy Koran by finding the Ark and displaying `how
       correct' the Bible was.

       Many Christian fundamentalists  who  interpret  the Bible literally,
       believe the Ark must be on Mt. Ararat."  He also said "Americans are
       exploiting the issue," and that  "all  foreigners  who  claim  to be
       looking for the  Ark  have  a Christian fundamentalist  organization
       supporting them."

       As always with these kind of articles, reporters find someone with a
       sheepskin in earth sciences and quote him saying my site is nothing
       but a rock formation shaped by thousands of years of erosion.

       I would lay  five  to one odds that this geologist has never been to
       my site, would dispute there ever was a flood or even care to know
       that the object has been exposed for a MERE 41 years!

       Another Turkish newspaper picked up  the  flurry and said tongue-in-
       cheek that now Turkey boasts TWO ARKS, and provides  a verG detailed
       list of Christendoms'  false  claim  of discovery over the past 140
       years.

       Believe me, the issue is not whether the Ark can be in two places
       at once or the possibility of two Arks. It runs much deeper than
       that.

       Before leaving Turkey, Aaron and  Garby  implored  the  Minister  of
       Antiquities to insure  that the area of the find be  protected  from
       any disturbance whatsoever, possibly relating their fear that George
       Vandeman might attempt  to dislodge pieces of gopher wood by blowing
       the sides out with dynamite (AON, p.33)

       Now how do I feel about this?  For one thing, befuddled that after
       four years of on site research with geologists and geophysicists 17
       miles south, and 27 years in the maritime industries, the claim
       that I am on a shipwreck is thwarted by an astronaut who says, "I'd
       like it looked at by experts" suggesting my opinions are impetuous
       and premature, but let a pharmacist and pilot  hang out of a
       helicopter and peer into an ice cave formed by a lava vent and it's
       acceptable to say "We are 100% sure" we are looking into the bowels
       of the Ark!

       While my site has been officially declared by the Turkish Government
       as the remains of the Ark, Irwin calling  for an expert's opinion at
       this late date seems a little odd.

       Soon after leaving the conference, Vendyl was good  enough  to share
       his podium at the fifty-ninth Annual International Meeting  and
       Exposition of the Society of Exploration Geophysicists at the Dallas
       Convention Center with  me,  where  I gave a luncheon address on the
       discovery of the remains of the wreck.

       Stressing the scientific data and the instrumentation put to use, it
       was well received, and I continue receiving mail on the subject.

       I feel that if one can pass scrutiny  of  THESE  EXPERTS  as well as
       convince the  Turks,  I  should  have  proved  my case....astronauts
       opinions not with-standing.


                                      Page 5





       Never the less,  the  December issue of the Bible-Science Newsletter
       heralded the discovery complete with  a  photo  of  the `Ark' on the
       southside of Ararat.

       I was surprised  to  see  it was the prominent outcropping  of  lava
       easily seen through binoculars from the roof of the Isfahan Hotel.

       Christendom's explorations are  going  high-tech  now,  with whirly-
       birds at $500.00 an hour (it costs  $8,000  just to get it to Ararat
       and back) and  the  two  are seeking funds ($30,000.00)  to  get  an
       airborne radar, so  this  is  a  desperate appeal to prove the Bible
       true.

       There are a number of guides who have  sat on this lava balcony, and
       even been inside  the  depression (a small cave of  sorts,  not  the
       insides of the Ark) leaving me wonder "why the charade?"

       Within this bunch,  there  is  a  kind  of  pecking order, a sort of
       jockeying for position of Inspector  #  12,  you  remember the Hanes
       underwear factory...if its not passed by #12, it ain't Hanes?

       Well, John Morris had held this position for  years,  chiefly due to
       his status as vice president of Creation Research and Creation Life
       Publishers.

       If you want  to  fill  the  heads  of  little children with Biblical
       truths such as "All of the various  kinds  of land dinosaurs were on
       the Ark with the rest of the animals" (Noah's Ark and the Lost World
       by John D. Morris, 1988 page 17) or publish your own pet theory as a
       tenant of Christian faith, then one should go along  with  Morris as
       the expert.

       He took a look at the site and said, "I don't really think it is the
       Ark." His traveling  companion was Grant Richards, another geologist
       that after viewing the site from the  air  said, "it appears to be a
       volcanic feature," following up with it was "an unusual feature!"

       Now folks! I  know  it  is  unusual  to  find volcanic  features  on
       volcanic mountains, and  I'll  admit  I'm mystified myself, but I am
       taking bets at five-to-one odds, that  this (lava vent) isn't Noah's
       Ark, and furthermore I intend to stay in Turkey all  summer  of 1990
       taking tours to  the  REAL  ARK waiting for these vicars of truth to
       prove me wrong!

       Let me repeat, that it is not a biblical truth, that the Ark is on
       Ararat. Ararat is a land and a kingdom by biblical definition, and
       a very mountainous land and kingdom, and any mountain will do.

       I challenge anyone to show me a document written prior to the 12th
       century C.E. stating the Ark is on Ararat.

       This is Armenian/Christian nonsense  and  for  those  who believe in
       such things, they should study the letter by Sbgar, king of Armenia,
       to Jesus, the  benevolent  Savior,  and  his reply,  penned  by  the
       Apostle Thomas (Bishop  Ukhtanes  of  Sebastia's HISTORY OF ARMENIA)
       for a better laugh!

       It is here we can see so clearly, that history is a myth agreed upon
       that for a great part is accepted without any substance or evidence.

                                      Page 6





       A hodge-podge of  theol gical  nonsense that has been building since
       Constantine's time and carried around  as  so much Byzantine baggage
       by believers without any critical examination as to the truth of it.

       The most faith shaking study of all, is the history  of  the  church
       since those times,  and  with  it  has  taught us to accept these as
       tenets of the Christian faith.

       The emphasis here for the continued  search  for  the Ark on Ararat,
       has been correctly deduced in the Turkish Press by Bayraktutan.

       Bayraktutan sees    this    quest   as   Christian   fundamentalists
       capitalizing on the search as an evangelical tool, to bring millions
       to Christ.

       It is my  view  that  Christendom wouldn't recognize the Ark if they
       were standing on it or Christ, if  they  came  face to face with the
       long lost Rabboni Yeshua Ben Yosef.

       Let me say  in  closing how much I enjoyed being the  guest  of  the
       Emmanuel Baptist Church   and   David  and  Sandra  Davis  over  the
       conference period.

       You all have been most warm in receiving me and my heretical notions
       and I am proud to feel that I am one  among  you during these trying
       times of religious  fictions  that understandably are  driving  many
       rationally-minded people out of religion altogether.

       I support the  line-upon-line  examinations  of David Davis and Jack
       Saunders and dearly hope that Rabbi  Katz  will continue to guide us
       along the path of the righteous Gentile.
