       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       A very interesting  letter appeared in a Dear Abby column concerning
       the subject of DEISM.  This rings so true with the principles we try
       to practice here at KeelyNet and Vangard  Sciences  that it deserves
       inclusion on the board.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Dear Abby :

          I recently saw an item in the RICHMOND TIMES-DISPATCH, written by
       Stan H. Covington Jr., which read

            "The Associated  Press reported that during an  interview  with
             CBS, Saddam Hussein said,

                    'God is  on  our  side, and Satan is on the side of the
                     United States.' "

          I wonder where Saddam received  his  "revelation."   Perhaps he's
       holding Adolf Hitler's old astrologer hostage, also.

          During World War II, while I was serving with  the  3rd  Army  in
       Germany, I removed a belt buckle from the uniform of a dead soldier.
       The lettering on the buckle read:

                        "  Gott Mit Uns  (God is With Us) "

          That started  me  to  thinking:  Can  religion  be taught without
       teaching bigotry as well?  If one  teaches, for example, that having
       a particular faith  MAKES ONE A BETTER PERSON, is  the  teacher  NOT
       ALSO IMPLYING THAT THE NON-BELIEVER IS AN INFERION ONE??

          An experienced  and motivated teacher might be able to do so, but
       how many parents or members of the clergy have BOTH THE WILL and the
       SKILL TO DO SO?

          Teaching "tolerance" alone is INADEQUATE in that it STILL IMPLIES
       that the other fellow is WRONG, but should be TOLERATED ANYWAY.

          As long as the "true believer"  is  taught  that he is in any way
       SUPERIOR to the non-believer, he is well on his way  to  becoming  a
       qualified BIGOT, RELIGIOUS FANATIC or member of one of the many HATE
       GROUPS that have been spawned by such teachings through the ages.

          To the extent that your column encourages readers to THINK FOR
       THEMSELVES and to  realize  that  there  is  nothing more wrong than
       SELF-RIGHTOUSNESS, you will have  again  performed  a  great  social
       service.

          Having only  recently  learned  of  its  definition   and   noted
       adherents, please sign  me  "A Deist," and let your readers research
       the term for themselves.  -  A Deist in Mollusk, VA.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Dear Deist:

          My research begins with the dictionary,  and  it  tells me that a
       deist is one who believes in the EXISTENCE OF GOD on the evidence of
       REASON and NATURE, with REJECTION of SUPERNATURAL REVELATION.

          We are a nation of people living together with varying religions.
       Our Constitution allows us freedom of religion, which  includes  the
       freedom NOT TO BELIEVE.

          So, be  advised that atheists and non-believers are also regarded
       as FULL-FLEDGED CITIZENS.  That's what freedom is all about.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       I was not aware of this belief system  of  DEISM until this article.
       My dictionary shows the following :

          de-ism  -  a  movement  or  system of thought advocating  natural
                     religion based on human reason RATHER than revelation,

                     emphasizing MORALITY,

                     and in  the  18th  century DENYING THE INTERFERENCE OF
                     THE CREATOR with the Laws of the Universe.

       The DEIST conception is very appropriate  to  the  Keely  system  of
       Harmonies within Nature.    All  that  IS,  is  manifested   through
       harmonies and disharmonies.

       This includes the GESTALTIC (group-mind) concept of a superior order
       resulting from a  combination  of lesser components which singly and
       separately could not possibly evolve to such a high level.

       The Greek idea of the Sacred Tetractys  best  describes  how  lesser
       forms unite to create more complex and thus more organized forms.

       To best explain this, an excerpt is included from the  file NEUTRAL1
       on KeelyNet :

       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                         ***  TRINITY AND SIGNATURES  ***

         A fundamental  frequency  is  generated and sustained by two other
         frequencies which each in turn are  generated and sustained by two
         other frequencies, ad infinitum..



                                      Page 2

                                    Fundamental
                                2                3
                              4   5            6   7

         This pattern  continues throughout the physical and energy body of
         an individualized  structure  and  is  the  basis  of  the  SACRED
         TETRACTYS of the Greeks.

                               * < --------  Fundamental
                              * * < -------  Harmonics
                             * * * < ------  Harmonics
                            * * * * < -----  Harmonics

          We can now  see how tuning to the Fundamental will give a certain
          degree of "sympathy" to a mass aggregation.

          This appears to be the basis for the trinity as  manifest  in all
          creation in the physical forms of PUSH, PULL AND BALANCE.

          As we tune to successively finer frequencies IN ADDITION to those
          preceding, we find progressively more precise sympathetic linking
          to allow   remote   stimulation   and   control   of  the  target
          aggregation.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Interference on the part of the creator (or any other entity capable
       of comprehending and  altering  energy  flows)  would  constitute  a
       warping of the natural order of the Universe normally  based  on and
       ruled by the laws of Harmony.

       I heretofore considered  myself an Agnostic, of the opinion that God
       is unknowable to the mind of Man.  Gnostic being to know from direct
       experience, Noetic being to know from abstract inspiration.

       This Deist concept  merits more study.   It  "resonates"  with  that
       special ring of truth.  Definitely worthy of more study.
