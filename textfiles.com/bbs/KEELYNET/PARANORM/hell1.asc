         This is  part  of an article that appeared in the March/April 1990
           issue of THE END TIMES AND VICTORIOUS LIVING, VOL. 4, NO. 3,
          a publication of the Paw Creek  Church  of  God, 1209 Little Rock
                            Road, Charolotte, NC 28214.
              It is a translation of an article from a Finnish paper.
                The fact that it is a translation accounts for the
                      bad grammar and unusual use of phrases.

          "The following  article  comes  from  a  Finnish   monthly  paper
           entitled, "Ammennusastia,"  published  in August 1989, by Suomen
           Jengi, ja Katulahetys r.y., Levasjoki 29880, Finland.  the phone

                          SCIENTISTS WERE AFRAID BECAUSE
                        THEY HAVE OPENED THE GATES OF HELL

       Geologists drilling a 9-mile deep hole into the earth's crust, claim
       to have heard human screams.  The  screams  of  the  condemned souls
       have been heard coming from the world's deepest hole,  and  now  the
       scientists are afraid  that  they  have  released the evil powers of
       hell to the surface of the earth.

       'The information that we are gathering is so surprising, that we are
       honestly truly afraid  of  what we  might  find  from  down  there.'
       explains Dr. Azzakov, the director of the project designed  to drill
       a 9-mile (14.4 Km) deep hole in distant Siberia.

       Geologists were dumbfounded after drilling many miles, when the bore
       drill started to spin wildly.

                                THE EARTH IS HOLLOW

       The only explanation  is  that  the  center  of  the earth is hollow
       explains Dr.  Azzakov.  The second  surprise  was  the  extreme heat
       that was noticed in the depth of the earth.

       'Our calculations indicate  temperatures of 2,000  F.  (Almost  1100
       C.).' points out  Dr.   Azzakov.   'This is 10 times higher than was
       anticipated.'

                                      Page 1





       It almost seems  that a fiery inferno is raging in the center of the
       earth.  The last discovery was so  incredible  that  the  scientists
       were afraid to continue the project.

       They attempted to listen to the movements at different layers of the
       crust by highly  sensitive  microphones that were lowered  into  the
       drill gorge.  What   they  heard,  changed  the  logically  thinking
       scientists to shaking ruins.

       'There was a faint, high sound that  we  thought  was  cause  by our
       equipment.' explains Dr.  Azzakov,  'But  after   some   tuning   we
       perceived that it  really  came  from  the  center of the earth.  We
       could hardly believe our ears.'

                                      VOICES


       What we heard,  was  evidently a  human  voice  screaming  in  pain.
       Although one voice was distinguishably separate, we  could  hear the
       screaming of thousands  or  maybe millions of tortured souls, in the
       background.

       After the terrible  discovery, half  of  the  scientists  have  quit
       because of their  fear.  'Hopefully what we found  there  will  stay
       there.' adds Dr.  Azzakov."

       ********************************************************************

       This is very  interesting,  especially considering some of the other
       files on Keelynet which contain ideas about the earth being hollow.

       However, a second article refutes  the  claims of the first one.  It
       comes from a paper called PROPHECY that is published  by Thy Kingdom
       Come Inc., P.O.  Box 580580, Tulsa, OK  74158.  Part of this article
       reads:

         "The story  was being circulated  by  a  Texas  evangelist  and  a
          national Christian television network....Leaders need to get into
          the habit of checking things out before they pass them along.

          It has astonished me and my staff to see how many people consider
          a story  'documented'  as  long as it appeared in  print  or  was
          broadcast on the air.

          A good example is the story of the Siberian drilling operation.
          When I  asked  the  Texas  evangelist's office what documentation
          they had, I was faxed two pieces of material.

          One was a copy of a Finnish article.  The other was a letter from
          a man in Norway, which had been sent to the television network.
          First, the  article.   It  was  not  from  a  'respected  Finnish
          scientific journal' as had been alleged.

          It was  from  a  newsletter  published  by  a  group  of  Finnish
          missionaries.  We  contacted  the  missionary group in Finland to
          ask where they got the story.   A  staff member said she had read
          it in a newspaper, and an editor there told us that the Siberian
          drilling story  was not a new article but had been  in  a  letter
          from a reader.

                                      Page 2





          We tracked  down the reader, who told us he remembered seeing the
          story in a Christian magazine published in Helsinki.

          The editor of that magazine said he got the story from an elderly
          man who translated it from English  and  thought he got it from a
          Christian newsletter from California.  So far, that's  where  the
          trail ends.

          The letter  to  the  Christian television network from the man in
          Norway said that he had seen the  Siberian  drilling  story  'all
          over the  papers' in Denmark and included a clipping  along  with
          what he said was a translation.

          We followed  up  on  the  letter  and  contacted  its author, Age
          Rendelin, a school teacher outside  Oslo.   I asked him if he had
          any way of knowing whether any of it is true.

          'Yes, I  do,'  Rendelin  answered.   'None  of  it  is  true.   I
          fabricated the  letter  and the translation is fiction, too.  The
          article I  sent  is  a  feature   about   a   Norwegian  building
          inspector.'

          Rendelin explained that he has been visiting California  and  had
          seen the   coverage   of  the  Siberian  drilling  story  by  the
          evangelist and TV network.

          It was  obvious  to him that neither  had  worked  very  hard  to
          substantiate the  story.   He  thought that if  he  sent  them  a
          fictitious letter they would use it, and he was right."

       The reader can  make  of this whatever he/she wants.  These articles
       were brought to my attention by a  friend  and  I  thought they were
       interesting and worth  sharing.   I  also  thought   it   would   be
       interesting to see  the  comments of other Keelynet users concerning
       this subject.
