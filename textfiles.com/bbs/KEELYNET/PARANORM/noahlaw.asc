             This non-profit group is headed by Mr. Vendyl Jones
            (inspiration for the movie character - Indiana Jones).
          The IJCR seeks to establish a mutual understanding between
         followers of the Jewish traditions and Christian traditions.

    The Laws of No'ach (Noah) preceded the New Testament and are the basis
         for the Ten Commandments later given to Moses on Mt. Sinai.

                         We wish to thank Mr. David Fasold,
                  discoverer of the true site of the Ark of Noah,
                      (as verified by the Turkish government),
                   for acquainting us with Vendyl and his group.

        Mr. Jones and a dedicated group of fellow researchers are currently
           (as of November 15, 1989) in Israel in search of two items,
             The Ashes of the Red Heifer and the Ark of the Covenant.

       The Ashes of the Red Heifer are the remains of a ritual sacrifice
           which are used to purify water and those who have been in
              physical contact with the dead, among other things.
           When the original Ashes are recovered, it will signal the
         re-establishment of the Sanhedrin (the Jewish ruling council)
               as well as spur the building of the Third Temple.
          The Ark of the Covenant is the "abode of the Living G-d".

      There has been much speculation about the Ark throughout history but
         especially in modern times as Man's understanding of electricity
         and nuclear forces increases.  The Bible is quite specific in the
       construction details of the Ark and there are reports that a copy was
    built by a northern university, (we have heard the University of Michigan).
         That copy was destroyed shortly thereafter due to the accumulation
           of lethal voltages.  George Van Tassel based his "Integratron"
           in Arizona after the Ark.  Van Tassel believed that his device
                 will rejuvenate the body and possibly alter time.
         It is currently still after construction following Van Tassels' death.
             The Ark of the Covenant appears to be a very large Leyden jar.

                         Other possibilities include :
             1)  an Orgone box (possibly to accumulate and store the
                 life force of sacrifices made in its presence),
             2)  a free energy device (based on a radioactive nature as
                 depicted by the infliction of boils and pyles on the
                 Philistines)
             3)  or a radio communication device with some higher/other
                 race or being.

    We will provide more details on these subjects as our understanding evolves.
