                               The End of the World
                          a commentary by Jerry W. Decker

       Amid recent world  events,  many  people we know and come in contact
       with have voiced concern that the  end  times  might  be  upon us as
       predicted in the biblical chapter of Revelations.

       The invasion of Kuwait by Iraq with the subsequent  increase  in oil
       prices brought on  armed responses from the majority of world powers
       directed at Iraq and the actions of Saddam Hussein.

       These armed responses have included trade embargoes and is likely to
       lead to a condition of war, not  yet  decided  at  the  time of this
       writing.

       As a matter  of  curiosity,  I  dug  out some information  regarding
       Revelations and a  relatively  successful  "modern"  seer  known  as
       Nostradamus.  It seems timely to  include  this  on the KeelyNet for
       those who might find it of interest.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       The Biblical reference to the Four Horsemen of the  Apocalypse tells
       what will precede the final days.

               And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on
               the throne a book written within and on the backside,
               sealed with seven seals.

       The book could  only  be opened by he who was worthy and that person
       proved to be the Lion of the Tribe  of  Judah,  the  Root  of David,
       known as Jesus Christ.

       Apocalypse came from the Greek word "apokalyptein  -  to  disclose".
       It is defined  as ANY revelation of a violent struggle in WHICH EVIL
       WILL BE DESTROYED.

       As the seals were broken, the following events transpired :

         Seal One    -  A white horse sprung  forth,  bearing a crowned man
         CONQUER        holding a bow.  His task was to CONQUER, a distinct
                        indication of war.

         Seal Two    -  A red horse sprung forth, mounted  by a man holding
         POWER          a  great  sword.   He had POWER and his task was to
                        take peace from the earth, that men should kill one
                        another.


                                      Page 1





         Seal Three  -  A black horse sprung forth, mounted by a man
         FAMINE         holding  a  pair  of balances in his hand.  A voice
                        said, "A measure  of  wheat  for a penny, and three
                        measures of barley for a penny; and  SEE  thou hurt
                        not the oil and the wine."  This can be interpreted
                        as FAMINE.

         Seal Four    -   A  pale horse sprang forth, mounted by Death, and
         DEATH          Hell followed with him.  Power was given to them to
                        kill with sword,  hunger  and  death,  and with the
                        beasts of  the  earth.   Here  we have  Pestilence,
                        disease and death.

         Seal Five    -  Released were the souls of them who were slain for
         REST           the word of God.   White  robes  were given to them
                        and they were told to rest yet awhile longer, UNTIL
                        THEIR FELLOW-SERVANTS AND BRETHREN SHOULD BE KILLED
                        AS THEY WERE (now).

         Seal Six    -  A great earthquake was released which  blotted  the
         EARTHQUAKE     sun  and  darkened  the  moon.  The stars of heaven
                        rained down onto  the  Earth  as if shaken from the
                        sky.  Heaven  rolled  back and every  mountain  and
                        island moved from their places.

       Prior to the  opening  of  the Seventh Seal comes the time which the
       Pentecost faith terms the "Rapture".   Rapture  defined is the state
       of being carried away with joy, love, etc. - ecstasy.

       Rapture in a  biblical  context begins when God instructs  the  four
       angels standing on  the  four  corners  of the Earth to hurt not the
       Earth, neither the sea, nor the  trees,  till  we  have  sealed  the
       servants of our God in their foreheads.

       This is where the number 144,000 comes in taken from  the  tribes of
       the children of Israel.  12,000 from each of 12 tribes.

       At this event,  are  large numbers of people dressed in white robes.
       These are they which came out of the  great  tribulation (exacted by
       the Four Horsemen), and who have washed their robes  to become white
       in the blood of the Lamb.

       All those before  the  throne  of  God shall hunger no more, neither
       shall they thirst, neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat.

       Only after the Rapture is the Seventh Seal opened, which we will not
       pursue.  Our main concern here is  the Four Horsemen and what threat
       they might represent to our future.

       The celebrated seer Nostradamus was born in December,  1503, in Remy
       De Provence, in  the south-east of France, even as a child he showed
       pronounced intellectual and precognitive powers.

       Although qualified as  a doctor,  he  was  powerfully  attracted  to
       astrology or what he called "the celestial science".

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       In 1555, after  months of seclusion in his secret study, Nostradamus
       published the first of ten books, ALL simply titled Centuries.  Each
       volume contained 100  prophecies,   all  written  in  an  enigmative
       verse-form.  They covered every country, every period in time, every
       individual of note - born or unborn.

       In Quatrain Three  of  Century  One,  he  says,  "The   litters  are
       overturned by the whirlwind and faces are covered by cloaks, the new
       republic will be  troubled by its people.  At this time the reds and
       whites will rule wrongly."

       This was seen as a prevision of the  1789  French  Revolution,  when
       what Nostradamus called "The Common Advent" - or the  seizing of the
       power by the mob - took place.  The 'reds' referred to the colour of
       the bloodthirsty Revolutionaries,   led   by  Robespierre,  and  the
       'whites' to the colour of the overthrown Bourbon rulers.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       The unsuccessful flight  of  Louis   XVI  and  Marie  Antoinette  to
       Varennes in 1791 was graphically described in these words :

              By night will come through the forest of Rheines
              Two partners by roundabout way;
              The queen, the white stone,
              The monk-king dressed in grey at Varennes,
              The elected Capet causes tempest, fire and bloody slicing.

       The king, of  course  was  a  member of the Capet royal  line  while
       'bloody slicing' was the guillotine.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       In the same way, he predicted Napoleon:

              An emperor will be born near Italy,
              Who will cost the Empire very dearly.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       And the emergence of Adolf Hitler (referred to as 'Hister') :

              In the mountains of Austria, near the Rhine
              there will be born of simple parents
              A man who will claim to defend Poland and Hungary
              And whose fate will never be certain.
              Beasts wild with hunger will cross the rivers,but
              The greater part of the battlefield will be against Hister.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       The Great Fire of London was predicted in this verse :

              The blood of the just will be demanded of London
              Burnt by fire in three times twenty plus six.

       Italians had a  habit  of  leaving  out  the  first numeral on dates
       giving us 3 X 20 + 6 = 666 or 1666.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                                      Page 3





       Before the Great  Fire  was  the  Great  Plague,  predicted  by  the
       following :

              The Great Plague of that maritime city
              Shall not cease till death is avenged;
              For the  blood  of  the  just  taken  and  condemned  through
              innocence
              And the Great Dame outraged by feigning saints.

       'Feigning saints' is a reference to the Puritans  while  the  'Great
       Dame' is St. Paul's Cathedral, which was destroyed in the fire.

       Other interpreters have  seen  the  Great Plague as a form of divine
       retribution targeted the masses who  did  nothing when Charles I was
       murdered.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       When King Edward  VIII  abdicated in 1936 for the love  of  American
       divorcess, Mrs. Wallis Simpson, Nostradamus predicted :

              For not wanting to consent to the divorce,
              Which afterwards will be recognised as unworthy,
              The king of the islands will be forced to flee
              And one put in his place who has no sign of kingship.

       King George VI  was  crowned in his brother Edwards' place, although
       he had no  experience or training  in  kingship.   George  was  also
       physically frail and stuttered.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       One of the lines seems to indicate the nuclear bombing  of  Nagasaki
       and Hiroshima :

           Near the harbour and in two cities will be two scourges
           the like of which have never been seen

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       During the war,  the  Nazis  rewrote certain verses of the Centuries
       volumes which mentioned Hister.  These doctored versions were spread
       as leaflets over France with the intent  that they would play on the
       superstitious and natural distrust of the British.

       In a turnabout ploy, British Intelligence favorable rewrote sections
       to their benefit and distributed thousands of copies  in the form of
       a German astrological  magazine  called  ZENIT.   This  magazine had
       ceased publication in 1939.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       What of our  times?   Specifically  the  years  preceding  the  long
       foretold end which is said will come in the year 2000.

       A third war is clearly foretold in the Centuries and is predicted to
       begin before the year 2000.  When two great powers unite in a common
       alliance against the East.

       Here we see  a  seeming  fulfillment through the unfolding of recent
       events.

       Specific events:

             1)  Russia releases its hold  on  many of its countries and is
                 becoming more friendly with America.

             2)  China,  seemingly on the verge of democracy,  is  suddenly
                 pulled back into the Communist grip.

             3)  Iraq invades Kuwait and calls for a Jehad or religious
                 war to call forth the faithful to destroy the unbelievers.

             4)  South Africa continues in its efforts to destroy apartheid
                 which has resulted in tens of thousands of useless deaths.

             5)  Latin   America  and  the  Philippines  continue  to  have
                 problems with the formation  and  stability  of  their own
                 government.

             6)  Japan  continues  to increase its outside  investments  as
                 well as fortify its financial position worldwide.

             7)  The  reunification  of  the  two  Germany's for the Fourth
                 Reich is imminent.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       What among these recent happenings  does  our friend Nostradamus see
       as representing the greatest danger?

              When those of the Northern Pole are united together
              In the East will be great fear and dread....

              One day the two great leaders will be friends,
              The New Land will be at the height of its powers,

              To the man of blood the number is repeated.

       The unification of  the countries of the Northern  Pole  could  mean
       either the Germany's  or  the  agreement  of  America  and Russia to
       achieve common goals.

       The East could mean the Arabs or the  Chinese, although at this time
       August 25, 1990,  the  Arabs present the greatest and  most  obvious
       threat.

       The New Land is a common name which Nostradamus uses for America.

       The 'man of  blood'  is  identified as the world's third Anti-Christ
       (with Napoleon and Hitler being the  1st  and  2nd).   This man will
       emerge from China.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------





                                      Page 5





       We have 9  years  until  the  century mark of 2000.  Nostradamus has
       given what he sees as the precise date of the final destruction :

              In the year 1999 and seven months

              From the sky will come the great King of Terror...

              Before and afterwards WAR reigns happily...

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       July 1999, the precise date of the Final War.

       Who is this King of Terror?  There are no other clues regarding this
       person or event in the Centuries.

       Will it be an invasion from another country or from an alien race?

       We continue to come across indications of technologies or principles
       which could lead to advanced technologies.

       However, FUNDING IS ALL in this reality.

       Will we be in a position to defend  ourselves?   Will our technology
       at that time have grown sufficiently to match the King of Terror who
       will descend from the skies?

       Who knows?  Perhaps if we can motivate, focus, organize  and give of
       ourselves for a  common, more universal good, we can yet thwart this
       prediction.
