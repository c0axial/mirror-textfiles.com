                           Contact Lenses for Hens?

    Wellesley, Mass. -  Randall  E.  Wise  had  it  all-a Harvard M.B.A., a
    profitable computer software company.  But he sold his firm to follow a
    dream, a dream to one day supply contact lenses to all the world's egg-
    laying chickens.

    Mr. Wise's contact lenses are already  on  100,000 chickens nationwide,
    and his company ANIMALENS INC. is growing.

    Oh, sure, people  laughed  at first.  "We'd talk to investors.   They'd
    say: 'Sounds neat.  Good luck,' " Mr. Wise recalls.

    But while Mr.  Wise  is  willing to joke a little about his enterprise,
    he's all business when it comes to discussing the future, which he says
    looks sunny side up.

    Before writing Mr. Wise off as a cuckoo,  understand  that  there  is a
    sound idea behind his scheme.  Chickens become positively  mellow  when
    they see the  world  through  rose-tinted  glasses-or better yet, fire-
    engine red contact lenses.

    Scientists aren't sure why, but a rosy  outlook  eliminates the pecking
    order among chickens, which normally tend to be pretty ornery critters.
    Red-eyed birds spend  less  time  fighting and more time  laying  eggs.
    They also eat less.

    According to Mr.  Wise's  calculations,  that translates into an animal
    savings of at least 50 cents a chicken,  or  2.5  cents per dozen eggs.
    With 1.2 billion laying chickens multiplied by the 20  dozen  eggs each
    yields a year, the savings could be $600 million.

    With such benefits, Mr. Wise is sure farmers will soon flock to buy his
    contact lenses, which  go  for a modest 20 cents a pair, or 15 cents if
    bought in bulk.  The hard lenses are put in place in seconds by holding
    the bird's head steady.  They stay  in  place for the life of the bird,
    or about a year.

    "The challenge is to go out and sell the product, especially  when it's
    new and different,"   Mr.  Wise  says.   "This certainly falls into the
    category of being new and different."

    The idea for  the lenses goes back  to  Mr.  Wise's  childhood  on  the
    chicken farm his  father managed in Northern California  in  the  early
    1960's.

    Mr. Wise's dad,  Irvin,  tried  to  produce lenses for chickens after a
    salesman told him about a farm where  chickens afflicted with cataracts
    behaved better than those with normal sight.

    "But the technology  didn't exist at the time for the  lens  to  work,"
    explains Mr. Wise, 41.  "The early lenses blinded the chickens."
    The elder Mr.  Wise's  fledgling  company  folded.  His son went off to
    college, worked in the shipping industry  for a time and then founded a
    computer software firm in Boston eight years ago that prospered.

    But the chickens  and the lenses were still on his mind.   Three  years
    ago he sold  his  company  for  several  million dollars and set out to
    pursue his dream.

    "I got out of computers because of  this,"  Mr. Wise says, "And I still
    don't miss computers.  I've believed in this for a long time."

    Not that everything  has  flown  smoothly since jumping  from  computer
    software to chicken eyewear.

    The lenses had  to  be  painstakingly designed so they wouldn't distort
    the chickens' vision or irritate their  eyes.   Mr. Wise keeps a jar in
    his office filled  with hundreds of pairs of failed  test  lenses  that
    looks like a container of jelly beans.

    "I look at  that  and  I  think "That's all behind us,'" Mr. Wise says.
    "We already know a lot someone else would have to figure out."

    Eventually, a useable lens was developed.   Mr.  Wise  contracted  with
    several small plants around Massachusetts to produce  the  lenses,  and
    field tests were conducted on farms around the country.

    Now, Mr. Wise says, the testing is over and it's time for his dreams to
    fly.

    "I'm very confident,"  Mr.  Wise  says  from  his firm's small suite of
    offices in this  affluent Boston suburb.  "1990  is  going  to  be  the
    inflection point for us, when this really takes off."
