                         MY NOOKIE DAYS ARE OVER,
                         MY PILOT LIGHT IS OUT
                         WHAT USED TO BE MY SEX APPEAL
                         IS NOW MY WATER SPOUT

                         TIME WAS WHEN OF ITS OWN ACCORD
                         FROM MY TROUSER IT WOULD SPRING
                         BUT NOW I HAVE A FULL TIME JOB
                         TO FIND THE BLASTED THING!....

                         IT USED TO BE EMBARRASSING, THE
                         WAY IT WOULD BEHAVE,  FOR EVERY
                         SINGLE MORNING IT WOULD STAND
                         AND WATCH ME SHAVE.

                         AS OLD AGE APPROACHES IT SURE GIVES
                         ME THE BLUES
                         TO SEE IT HANG ITS WITHERED HEAD
                         AND WATCH ME TIE MY SHOES...
