       Dear Friend,


       We have the  distinguished  honor  of being on the committee for the
       raising of $5,000,000 for placing  a  statue  of Bill Clinton in the
       Hall of Fame in Washington D.C.

       This commitee was in a quandary as to where to place  the statue. It
       was not wise to place it beside the statue of George Washington, who
       never told a  lie,  nor  beside  Jesse  Jackson,  who never told the
       truth, since Bill Clinton could never tell the difference.

       We finally decided  to  place it beside  Christopher  Columbus,  the
       greatest democrat of all. He left not knowing where he was going,
       did not know  where he was, and returned not knowing  where  he  had
       been, and did it all on borrowed money.

       Over 3,000 years ago, Moses said to the children of Israel, "Pick up
       your shovels, mount  your  asses  and camels, and I will lead you to
       the promised land." Nearly 3,000 years  later,  Roosevelt said, "Lay
       down your shovels, sit on your asses, and light up  a camel, this is
       the promised land."

       Now, Bill Clinton  is  going to steal your shovels, kick your asses,
       raise the price of camels, and mortgage  the  promised  land. If you
       are one of the unfortunate people who has anything left after taxes,
       we expect a generous contribution to this worthwile project.


       Fraternally,



       Bill Clinton Statue Commitee

       P.S.  It is  said  that  Bill  Clinton is considering  changing  the
             democratic party  emblem from a donkey to a condom, because it
             stands for  inflation,  protects  a  bunch  of  pricks,  halts
             production and  gives  a false sense of security  while  being
             screwed.
