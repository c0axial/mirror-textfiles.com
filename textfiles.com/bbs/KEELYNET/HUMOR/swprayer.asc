                 Our program who art in memory, Hello be thy name.
                 Thy operating system come, thy commands be done,
                      at the printer as it is on the screen.

                         Give us this day our daily data,
                           and forgive us our I/O errors
               as we forgive those whose logic circuits are faulty.

                           Lead us not into frustration,
                         and deliver us from power surges.

                            For thine is the algorithm,
                                 the application,
                                 and the solution,
                            looping for ever and ever.
                                      Return.
