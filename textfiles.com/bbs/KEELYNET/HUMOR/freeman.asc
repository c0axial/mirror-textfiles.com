       Here is the  the  text  of  some  classified  ads  placed in a local
       newspaper a couple of years ago.  Everyone  thinks  they  are pretty
       humorous.  I wonder if this guy ever got any responses.

       These appear to  be  descriptions  of  inventions that  this  fellow
       Freeman wants to  sell  through his advertisements.  I cleaned it up
       somewhat to make  a  bit  more  sense.   They  don't  appear  to  be
       patented, but he  does  not specify if they are.   If  anyone  knows
       anything about this  Freeman  fellow,  we'd appreciate some clues or
       copies of papers.

       A Public Declaration.

       One of the Trade Secrets that I have of every Mobile  Invention that
       I have ever created that can move one or more adult Human Beings
       With an Electric  Motor  is  the use of a Generator that is my Trade
       Secret, the Generator.  No one else  on  this  planet had that Trade
       Secret before me.  There is more than one way that  I  can prove it.
       One of them  is  the  use  of  my own Tape Recorder and my own Video
       Cassette Radio Cam-Corder Television Cameras that is good machinery.
       I am the only one who runs that machinery. They keep breathing their
       thoughts, they did  not create those  Inventions,  I  created  those
       inventions.  I can use that procedure with any invention that I have
       ever created.   My  Business Address,  General Delivery,  Aptos,  CA

       Mr. Freeman indicates  he has some kind of primary invention related
       to an electro-magnetic generator  or  electro-magnetic  battery, but
       goes a bit  overboard with the Reversed Jet Sea Plane  that  can  go
       from planet to planet.  Wonder if Aptos is near Sonora?

       I ask this  because  he  writes  very  much  like  C.A.A.  Dellschau
       (disjointed English) and the group  of  experimenters  back  in  the
       1850's known as the Sonora Aero Club.  Perhaps this  fellow stumbled
       on some of   the   later  inventions?   They  too  had  bizarre  and
       futuristic devices but swore to secrecy  regarding the dissemination
       and public use of their inventions.  They were major  pacifists  and
       afraid governments would use their machines for war.  Who knows?
