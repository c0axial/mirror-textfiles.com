                         Report of the Technical Committee
                       To Determine Market Opportunities for
                                   The Telephone

       1.  The telephone is so named by its inventor, A. G. Bell, who sees
           for it a vast future as a means of personal communication by
           voice.  He believes that one day they will be installed in every
           residence and place of business.

       2.  We note that Bell's profession is that of a voice teacher, and
           particularly a teacher of the deaf.  He appears to have no
           direct experience with the telephone or any other form of
           communication, electrical or otherwise.  Yet he claims to have
           discovered an instrument of great practical value in
           communication, which has been overlooked by thousands of workers
           who have spent years in the field.

       3.  Bell's proposal to place his instruments in almost every home
           and business house (an this is the only way which their
           potential may be realized) is fantastic in view of the capital
           costs of installing the endless numbers of wires and cables that
           would be demanded.  The central exchange alone would represent a
           huge outlay in real estate and buildings, to say nothing of the
           electrical equipment.

       4.  Bell expects that the public will use his instruments without
           the aid of trained operators.  Any telegraph engineer will at
           once see the fallacy of this plan.  The public simply cannot be
           trusted to handle technical communication equipment.  In any
           home where there are children, to mention only one point, there
           would inevitably be a high rate of breakage and frivolous use of
           the instruments.  Furthermore, when making a call the subscriber
           must give the number verbally to the operator and have to deal
           with persons who may be illiterate, speak with lisps or stammer,
           have foreign accents or who may be sleepy or intoxicated when
           making a call.

       5.  While every telegram consists in itself a written record of what
           is being communicated, Bell's instrument uses nothing but the
           voice, which cannot be captured in concrete form, and therefore
           would be no record of what was said or agreed upon.  We leave it
           to you to judge whether any sensible man would transact his
           affairs by such a means of communication.





       6.  Bell expects that the subscribers to this service will pay to
           have the instruments installed in their premises and will
           thereby pay for each call made, with a monthly minimum if no
           calls are made.  We feel that it is unlikely that any
           substantial number of people will agree to such an arrangement
           in view of the telegraph offices which are now giving efficient
           round the clock service in every neighborhood and the smallest
           towns--which charge only for actual messages according to
           length.

       7.  In conclusion, the committee feels that it must advise against
           any investment whatever in Bell's scheme.  We do not doubt that
           it will find a few users in special circumstances such as
           between the bridge of a ship and the engine rooms, but any
           development of the kind and scale which Bell so fondly imagines
           is utterly out of the question.

       (Note: Origin unknown, but very plausible, as Western Union did
              indeed decide not to invest in telephones in the early
              1900's.    Richard Lane 4/26/85)
