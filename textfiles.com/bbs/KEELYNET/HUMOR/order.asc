                                   The Order
                               by Dale Lowdermilk

The use of experimental human "Tracer Implant Microtransmitters" (TIM) as a
means of tracking escaped prisoners, convicted felons and high-risk parolees
was upheld in the Supreme Court Decision (Bakhous v. State of California, 9-18-
85, #49005,4) several years ago.  Despite the arguments of "invasion-of-
privacy," the overriding benefits for society and assistance to law
enforcement officials was deemed a "greater good."  Within a year following
this historical decision, every Federal and State prison had implanted emitter
devices in ALL INMATES.  There were also approximately 800 pioneers, five were
botanists who became lost during a scientific exploration in the Everglades.
When their boat capsized, four survivors and the body of the fifth were located
by their TIM signals, similar to the "emergency locator beacon" of a downed
aircraft.  The utility and potential for human tracking became a national
preoccupation.  Everyone wanted his own "personal transmitter."

HOW DOES THE 2ND GENERATION TRANSMITTER WORK?

Smaller than the period at the end of this sentence, the latest TIM device can
be implanted with a sterilized "pinprick" (just like a TB-TINE Test) or inhaled
from an atomizer.  It can be installed under the skin, in a muscle or within
any organ of the body.  It is micro-encapsulated and is chemically inert within
the body.  Once it is painlessly implanted you cannot feel or see it.  The
transmitter itself is a quartz-silicon product of the space age.  It requires
no power supply but emits a low frequency discreet "BINARY TIME-SPACE CO-
ORDINATE."  The principle is similar to the primitive "crystal-radio" (that
never needs a battery) combined with the LORAN-C navigation equipment.  Using
simple triangulation, the low power TIM (tracer implant microtransmitter)
signal is relayed via existing radio and television antennas to the Tracking
Data Center (TDC) in Montecito, California.  All signals are recorded on laser
microvideo discs and filed according to their Time-Location and frequency.

Every person has, from the moment the TIM is activated, an individually coded
frequency and every geographical location has a longitude/latitude "grid-
number."  All of it is transmitted as a "Data-Binary-Pulse" every 2 seconds.
Each of us becomes a (walking, running, or sleeping) "Inertial Navigation
System."  Even after death, the transmissions continue...unless the
microtransmitter is physically destroyed, or the computer code at TDC is
deleted.

WHAT ARE THE APPLICATIONS OF TRACER IMPLANT MICROTRANSMITTERS?

A concerned wife notified authorities, and TDC, that her husband, a voluntary
implantee, was overdue from a camping trip.  His code/frequency "grid" was
identified halfway down a steep mountainside, and within 45 minutes he was
rescued.

A truck and sedan collided head-on and both drivers were killed.  The computer
replay of the truck driver's TIM (involuntary ex-con implantee) data pulse
record indicated that he had stopped at two liquor stores just before turning
on to the Interstate Highway.  The time-distance data also indicated that the
truck was traveling in excess of 82 MPH at the moment of impact.  The family of
the sedan driver, using this indisputable scientific TIM information, was able
to win a reckless-driving suit against the estate of the truck driver.  The
legal aspects of TIM are as valid as fingerprints!

Several people were hospitalized for food poisoning.  A "replay" of the TIM
data of two of the patients immediately pinpointed the source.

A man accused of bank robbery was released after his TIM data verified that his
"data-pulse'record" did not coincide with the event.  Immediate correlation is
possible for anyone accused of any crime....if they have already received a
human tracer implant microtransmitter.

Within five years, TIM devices will also be able to carry
hormonal/neuroelectrical/respiratory diagnostic information (in conjunction
with time-location data).  If you experience a heart attack, Tracking Data
Center (TDC) will instantly notify the nearest hospital...and will tell doctors
where you are!!!  Someday, using TIM, a person who has never had a physical
examination may receive a telephone call telling him to "see a doctor for high
blood pressure."  The TDC Computer will know before you do that your stomach
ache COULD be a peptic ulcer.  Potential suicides might be indentified by a
preceding "chemo-neuro imbalance" and tragedy averted.  Just as fiber optics
once revolutionized communications, TIM improvements will soon permit
voice/audio data to be simultaneously transmitted with the individual's data-
binary-pulse.  This means that everything you have ever said (or heard!) will
be recorded at Tracking Data Center.  Crimes against persons and property will
become virtually nonexistent!!  (Kidnappers will NEVER steal a child who is
equipped with a Tracer Implant Microtransmitter!!)  What parent does not LOVE
his/her child enough to protect IT with this miraculous device?

With the installation of four new Master Relay Satellite Receivers (MRSR) and
high speed tracking digitizers, the existing "passive code zones" (areas where
TIM signals cannot be received by the Tracking Data Center) which are within a
61 mile radius of the North Pole and a 48 mile radius of the South Pole, will
be "covered."  Worldwide human TIM tracking will become a reality and you will
be able to witness the data-binary-pulse of ANYONE....even the astronauts as
they circle as Earth.

Because of this incredible potential for human good, and for the benefit of all
Mankind, the following Executive Order is enacted.

  EXECUTIVE ORDER #788318

  Human Tracer Implant Microtransmitters (TIM) shall be placed within ALL
  NEWBORN INFANTS, at all hospitals and home-birthing centers in North
  America.  The implantation may be performed by the delivering doctor/nurse
  or a representative of the Department of Transponder Records (DOTR).
  Failure to perform this action will result in Federal penalties and possible
  revocation of medical or professional licenses.  The cost of both
  implantation and the TIM device shall be carried by the U.S. Government, and
  there will be electrohormonal punishments for those attempting to remove,
  modify or tamper with already implanted transmitters.

  Signed, President of the United States
          Secretary, Department of Transponder Records
          Secretary, Administrator Tracking Data Center
