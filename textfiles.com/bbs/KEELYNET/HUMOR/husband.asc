       This chain  letter  started  with  the  hope of bringing relief to
   TIRED and UNHAPPY wives.  Unlike other  chain  letters  you have seen,
   THIS ONE DOSEN'T COST ANY MONEY.  Simply send a copy of this letter to
   four of your married friends who are tired and unhappy.   Then, bundle
   up your husband  and send him to the woman at the top of the list, and
   add your name to the bottom of the list.

       Someday you will be at the top.   When  your name comes to the top
   of the list  you  will receive 16,487 men and some  of  them  will  be
   dandies.  Have faith  in  this  letter and don't break the chain.  One
   woman broke the chain and she received  her  old  husband back.  Don't
   let this happen to you.

      At the time of this letter, a friend had received  365  men.   When
   they buried her  yesterday, it took seven undertakers thirty-six hours
   to get the smile off her face and two days to get her legs together so
   they could close the coffin.

                                                              A Friend
