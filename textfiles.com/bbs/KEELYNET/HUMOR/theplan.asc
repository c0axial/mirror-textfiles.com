                       IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE PLAN
                       AND THEN CAME THE ASSUMPTIONS

                   AND THE ASSUMPTIONS WERE WITHOUT FORM

               AND THE PLAN WAS COMPLETELY WITHOUT SUBSTANCE

             AND THE DARKNESS WAS UPON THE FACE OF THE WORKERS

                    AND THEY SPAKE AMONGST THEMSELVES,

          SAYING  "HARK, IT IS A CROCK OF SHIT, AND IT STINKETH"
                AND THE WORKERS WENT UNTO THEIR SUPERVISORS

             AND SAYETH  "HARK, IT IS A PAIL OF DUNG, AND NONE
                        MAY ABIDE THE ODOR THEREOF"

               AND THE SUPERVISORS WENT UNTO THEIR MANAGERS
                       AND SAYETH UNTO THEM  "HARK,
                   IT IS A CONTAINER OF EXCREMENT AND IT
              IS VERY STRONG, SUCH THAT NONE MAY ABIDE BY IT"

                AND THE MANAGERS WENT UNTO THEIR DIRECTORS
       AND SAYETH  UNTO  THEM  "HARK, IT IS A VESSEL OF FERTILIZER AND
                       NONE MAY ABIDE ITS STRENGTH"

         AND THE DIRECTORS SPAKE AMONGST THEMSELVES, SAYING ONE TO
        ANOTHER,"BEHOLD, IT CONTAINS THAT WHICH AIDS PLANT GROWTH,
                          AND IT IS VERY STRONG"

              AND THE DIRECTORS WENT UNTO THE VICE PRESIDENTS
                 AND SAYETH UNTO THEM  "IT PROMOTES GROWTH
                           AND IS VERY POWERFUL"

              AND THE VICE PRESIDENTS WENT UNTO THE PRESIDENT
             AND SAYETH UNTO HIM  "THIS NEW PLAN WILL ACTIVELY
            PROMOTE THE GROWTH AND EFFICIENCY OF THIS COMPANY,
                     AND WE SHALL HAVE GREAT STRENGTH"

                  AND THE PRESIDENT LOOKED UPON THE PLAN,
                         AND SAW THAT IT WAS GOOD,
                        AND THE PLAN BECAME POLICY.

                    "BEHOLD, THIS IS HOW SHIT HAPPENS"
