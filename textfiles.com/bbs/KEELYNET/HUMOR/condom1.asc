                                The Law and Condoms

       Germany - Methodical  Germans  have  rules  for  everything else and
       they've now come up with a CONDOM code!

       Henceforth, condoms must be AT LEAST 6.4 inches long and 1.96 inches
       around, be either smooth or have small  bumps, and may come in pink,
       black, green, blue, red, yellow or orange.

       Germans, however, aren't  alone in dictating how condoms  should  be
       made.

       The British Standards  Institute  requires  condoms  to be a wee bit
       shorter than the German models.   But  THEY'RE  FATTER  -  a  full 2
       inches around the middle.

       And there are no color restrictions, just a requirement  the condoms
       come with a full set of instructions on how to use them.
