           I.  Beware the lightning that lurketh in the undischarged
                    capacitor, lest it cause thee to bounce upon thy
                         buttocks in a most un-technician-like manner.

          II.  Cause thou the switch that supplieth large quantities
                    of juice to be opened and thusly tagged, that thy
                         days in this earthly veil of tears may be long.

         III.  Prove to thyself that all circuits that radiateth and
                    upon which thou workest are grounded and thusly
                         tagged, lest they lift thee up to radio frequency
                              potential and causeth thee also to make like
                                   a radiator.

          IV.  Tarry not amongst those fools who engageth in intentional
                    shocks for they are surely non-believers and are not
                         long for this world.

           V.  Take care that thou useth the proper method when thou
                    takest the measure of a high voltage circuit, lest
                         thou incinerate both thyself and thy meter, for
                              verily, though thou hast no account number
                                   and canst be easily surveyed, thy test
                                       meter doth have one and, as a con-
                                            sequence, bringeth much woe
                                                 unto the supply depot.

          VI.  Take care that thou tampereth not with safety devices and
                    interlocks, lest thou incurreth the wrath of thy
                         instructor and bringeth the fury of thy
                              instructor upon thy head.

         VII.  Work thou not with energized equipment, for if thou dost,
                    thy fellow students will surely buy beers for thy
                         spouse, who liveth, (and consoleth them in other
                              ways).

        VIII.  Trifle thou not with radioactive tubes and substances, lest
                    thou commence to glow in the dark like a lightning bug
                         and thy spouse have no further use fo thee except
                             thy wages.

          IX.  Causeth thou not to make unauthorized modifications to
                    equipment, lest thou arrange to have recorded all field
                         changes and authorized mods made by thee, that thy
                             successor shall not tear his hair and go
                                  slowly mad in his attempt to decide what
                                        manner of cretin hath made such a
                                            mess in the wiring of such
                                                equipment.

           X.  Be thou cautious in the placing of thy digits into such
                    equipment that would cause thee to sorely lament the
                         loss of thy greatest sexual appendage.
