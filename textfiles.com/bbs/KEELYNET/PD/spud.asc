                             Pay-up time for Shareware
                                by Patrician Keefe

         Guilt over unregistered shareware use was the impetus behind SPUD

       March 17 was  SPUD  day,  in  case  you  didn't  know, and we're not
       talking about the butter-laced carbs St. Patrick's Day partiers wash
       down with green beer.

       Early reports indicated that SPUD,  or  Shareware  Pay-Up  Day,  was
       probably not as popular as was the wearing of the green.  But it may
       pack some punch  in  the  long run if the Association  of  Shareware
       Professionals (ASP) decides  to  put some effort into publicizing it
       as an annual event.

       SPUD is the fruit of the fertile mind  of shareware user Paul Pease,
       a high-technology writer and planner based in Palo Alto, Calif.  The
       idea, he said,  was  to  spur  guilt-ridden, unregistered  shareware
       users into writing some long overdue checks.

       Pease is not  talking  big  bucks  per  individual  user.  Shareware
       ranges from $10 to $200 for a full-fledged  package.  Some purveyors
       don't even charge.   "There's one guy who has 'smileware.'   Payment
       consists of smiling  at  someone.   Another  guy has 'beerware.'  He
       only asks that you have a beer and  send  him a postcard saying so."
       Pease chuckled.

                                   Money adds up

       If enough satisfied users register after trying out  their  software
       for 30 days,  it  can  add  up  to significant income for individual
       shareware authors.

       ASP President Paul Mayer, who also  heads  up  Zpay Payroll Systems,
       Inc. in St. Petersburg, Florida, said he has made enough  money from
       shareware to quit  his  onetime  "day  job," buy a spacious house in
       Florida and, on some days, sit poolside answering support questions.

       Data Storm Technologies,  Inc.,   with   its  ProComm  product,  and
       ButtonWare, Inc., each had more than $3.5 million  in  revenue  last
       year.  Mayer added.

       Successes like these   come   despite  the  fact  that  ASP  members
       estimated that a paltry 1% to 10%  of  users  of their packages ever
       bother to register.  Users of business programs are  the most likely
       to pay.

       Until now, the ASP never thought to designate a SPUD of its own.  In
       fact, the group   has   specific  rules  against  what  Mayer  calls
       "nagware."  One such example of nagware  is  having  a screen pop up
       every five minutes demanding payment.

       "Mostly what we worry about are those who do register.   We  want to
       give them the   best  service  possible,"  he  said.   Because  most
       shareware providers do not advertise, except through bulletin boards
       and the occasional shareware catalog,  Mayer  figures  that a better
       product means more    registrations.    He   will    even    service
       nonregistered users who  call in with questions, reasoning that they
       will either register on the spot or tell their friends, some of whom
       might ante up.

       "There's no pressure.  We just hope  people will respect our quality
       and effort and provide some reimbursement," Mayer explained.

       However, SPUD has Mayer thinking.

       "It was a great idea; it just needs more publicity," he said, adding
       that the ASP is thinking about making it an annual event.
