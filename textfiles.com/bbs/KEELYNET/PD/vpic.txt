VPIC is a file viewer/converter for EGA, VGA and SuperVGA display adapters.  It  supports  Ahead (A & B  chips),  ATI,
Chips & Technology, Everex, Genoa, Headland (Video 7),  Oak,  Paradise, Trident  (8800 BR & CS and 8900 chips),  Tseng
(ET-3000 &  ET-4000 chips),  Western Digital, Video 7, and Zymos VGA chips,  and VESA standard boards,  in all EGA/VGA
graphics modes for each display card. It is configurable for your display card using  a  plain text configuration file
and the accompanying CONFIG and CVPIC configuration programs. A comprehensive DOC file explains all  features of VPIC.
If your card supports VESA, VPIC will automatically detect and use the VESA modes; defeated with /v option.

VPIC will display ,and convert to, the following graphics file formats:
    BIF Binary Image Format B&W image capture board files (display only).
    BMP Microsoft Bitmap files, normal and compressed; saves uncompressed.
    CUT Dr Halo machine independent format with a palette file.
    GIF viewing, normal and interlaced (Fractint FRA and GIF89a viewing too).
    GIF saves in normal, interlaced, inverted, mirrored, rotated CW or CCW 90 degrees.
    LBM Deluxe Paint VGA format, regular and enhanced (IFF Electronic Arts files too).
    MAC file (display only).
    PCX including the VGA version 1.61 of PC Paintbrush.
    PIC Pictor/PC Paint and ViewPoint (ViewSonic) files.
    SCx file formats for Colorix and EGA Paint.
    TGA Targa 8 thru 32 bits/pixel normal and compressed file formats. Tseng HiColor support too.

VPIC also has many handy features, such as:
Command line options:   vpic [path][filename[.ext]][/a][/b][/c][/e][/h][/r][/w][/xN][/yN][/z][/?]      where:
    path specifies a drive/directory for the menu or a single file.
    filename[.ext] specifies a single file to show (GIF ext assumed) or a DOS filespec such as c*.pcx for the menu.
    /a specifies auto resolution select.      /b specifies beep after decoding each file.       /? shows VPIC help.
    /c shows current configuration.           /e specifies 16 color (EGA) mode.
    /h lists hidden files in menu; great files you don't want to come up in menu normally such as x rated.
    /mN specifies to lock the display mode to N, where the mode numbers are defined when you run CONFIG.
    /r specifies return to calling application after decoding picture file without changing the video mode.
    /v disables VESA info and uses config file info.
    /w specifies to wait for a keypress between images for a multi-image GIF file.
    /xN specifies a left margin of N pixels (if the file does not overflow the right edge).
    /yN specifies a top margin of N pixels (if the file does not overflow the bottom edge).
    /z inhibits printing the filename when the picture is displayed.
    /@slidefile shows pictures specified in the ASCII command file slidefile.  The pictures  are  shown  in  the order
        listed, and you can spec a delay, resolution, animate, and animate rate for each picture.
Fast, easy menu system with mouse support and the following features:
    * Handles up to 500 files using mouse or keyboard.
    * Cursor moved with arrow keys, PgUp/PgDn keys, or starting letter/number of filenames.
    * Files are marked/unmarked for viewing with the Spacebar.
    * F1 displays built in help.
    * F2 does a slideshow of marked files in the order they were marked.
    * Enter shows marked files individually in the order they were marked, or file at cursor (if none marked).
    * F3 shows size and colors of picture at cursor.
    * F4 selects between 256 and 16 color modes.
    * F5/F6 decrease/increase default resolution.
    * F7 selects Normal/Lock/Auto resolution. Auto picks the best resolution. Lock always uses default mode.
    * F8 waits for a keypress between images in multi-image GIF's.
    * F9 prompts for new path and filespec.
    * F10 shows current directory.
    * Alt_X deletes file at cursor (with users permission; ESC or N aborts).
    * Menu automatically updated when files are created or deleted.
    * Picture decoding aborted with Escape.
Commands while viewing a picture (mouse buttons: left=Enter, right=ESC while decoding):
    'A' Animates the picture by rotating the palette; really nice for fractals.
    'E' expands a compressed Targa file to disk.               / or ? displays built in help.
    F1-F10 are adjustments for red, green, blue, brightness, & contrast for VGA viewing. F10 restores original color.
    Up/Down arrows and PgUp/PgDn scroll picture vertically if bigger than screen (and you have enough display  memory,
        and not a Video 7 card). VPIC does not scroll sideways; see 'How VPIC Works' in VPIC.DOC.
    Alt_F momentarily displays filename while viewing.
    Alt_X deletes the current file (with users permission; ESC or N aborts).
    B, C, D, F, G, I, M, P, R, T, U, W, Z, <, > are file conversion/manipulation commands.
Configuring VPIC: You can configure VPIC from a menu by simply entering CONFIG from DOS  with CONFIG, VPIC, CVPIC  and
    all the configuration files (.cfg extension) in the same directory.  Then select the desired config file using the
    arrow keys and press enter; ESC aborts CONFIG. VPIC can still be configured manually by entering `cvpic configfile'
    from DOS. The WHICHVGA program tries to identify your VGA chip and how much display memory you have installed.
History: The previous program was VGIF, which displayed only GIF files.  It became  VPIC  when  the ability to display
    other file formats was added. The GIF file format is copyrighted by CompuServe Incorporated, Columbus, Ohio.

VPIC is continually being improved, and new features are added all the time. Check it out.  You can register  VPIC for
only $15, or get VPIC from me by sending the $15 registration fee plus $5  ($10 outside the USA)  postage and handling
($20/$25 total). As a bonus, I will fill the rest of the disk with GIF good pictures. Please specify either a 360K  or
1.2 Meg 5.25 inch disk (I don't have 3.5" disks), and EGA,  VGA,  or  SuperVGA  (640x480x256, etc)  pics.  For foreign
orders, please send an International or Postal Money Order, a check drawn on a US bank, or cash,  since the banks here
charge $25 collection fee for foreign checks.
