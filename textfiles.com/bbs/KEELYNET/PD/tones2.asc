       Hi there!  TONES2  is  a program that generates tones for paranormal
       studies.  I didn't download it but  got it from some people who were
       promoting the author's software.  I've had a copy in  my  hard drive
       for a year,  so  I'm  sure it's pretty bug free.  You have some nice
       files, although unfortunately, I already  have  most of the material
       you have in your files, as I've found since reading your files.  But
       still there are others out there who may not be aware  of  this,  so
       you guys are doing a great service.  Anyway, hope this program is of
       value.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       This is a  simple  computer  program  that  produces  tones  on  the
       computer speaker ranging  from 18.21Hz to 655.35Hz.  This  range  is
       dictated by the   limitations   of   the  simple  personal  computer
       hardware. However, this program provides  a relative inexpensive way
       (you get the program free), to study the effects of  specific  sound
       frequencies on your mind and body.

       The program lists   the   frequency   requested  and  the  frequency
       calculated.  These will be different  at  times. The reason for this
       is again the  simple personal computer hardware. This  is  also  the
       reason you CAN  NOT  produce  all  the  frequencies  you  would want
       exactly.

       The program with all it's limitations,  is  still  a  useful tool to
       study the effect of the 'High Beta' range of frequencies.

       Please, feel free to write and comment on this program,  and  let me
       know what results  you achieve. If you find any specific frequencies
       that achieve the same results consistenly,  write and let me know. I
       will include these   frequencies   in   future   versions   of   the
       documentation in this program.

                               Thank you, and ENJOY!
                               Roberto Artigas Jr.

       There are four ways to start tones. They are described bellow.

            1)      tones [/H]
                          Help

       Starting tones this way allows you to get the HELP information, plus
       a few examples of the more complicated way to start tones.

            2)      tones

       Starting tones this  way  allows you to use the basic features. This
       allows basic keyboard interaction.  This  starts  the  program at 35
       Hertz.

            3)      tones begin
                          Hertz

       Starting tones this way allows you to use the basic  features.  This
       allows basic keyboard   interaction.  This  starts  the  program  at
       <begin> Hertz specified.
                                      Page 2




       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       PAGE 1

            4)      tones begin  ending  [/S:sec]  [/I:inc]  [/C:cnt]
                          Hertz  Hertz   How long   Hertz    Count

       Starting tones this  way  allows  you  to  use  the  HANDS OFF timed
       features.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       The program starts at the <begin>  Hertz  and  goes  to the <ending>
       Hertz. It holds the tone for <sec> seconds and proceeds  to go UP or
       DOWN by <inc> Hertz.
       Once it gets  to the end of either <begin> or <ending> Hertz it will
       change direction and go DOWN or UP  by  <inc>  Hertz. This change of
       direction will happen <cnt>-1 times.

       <cnt>   Count range    : 1 Time  to  1000 Times  Default: 10 Times
       <sec>   Seconds range  : 2 Secs  to   300 Secs   Default:  2 Seconds
       <inc>   Increment range: 1 Hz    to   100 Hz     Default:  1 Hertz
       <begin> Hertz range    :35 Hz    to   655 Hz.
       <ending>Hertz range    :35 Hz    to   655 Hz.

       The <cnt>, <sec>,  and  <inc>  parameters  are  all   optional.  The
       parameters needed are <begin> and <ending>.

       If you DO  NOT understand what you just read, DO NOT worry, continue
       reading.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       PAGE 2

            4)      tones begin  ending  [/S:sec]  [/I:inc]  [/C:cnt]
                          Hertz  Hertz   How long   Hertz    Count

       Before tones starts on AUTOMATIC it  will tell you APPROXIMATELY how
       much time it will run with the parameters that have  been  selected.
       If you do  not like the amount of time, press the Esc button on your
       keyboard and the program will go  back  to  the  DOS prompt. At this
       point you can select a new set.

       Once tones is on AUTOMATIC you can stop the program  by pressing the
       ESC button on your keyboard. Please NOTE that tones might take <sec>
       number of seconds to respond to your request to stop. Be patient, it
       ** WILL ** stop.

       Please NOTE that  Ctrl-C  has  been disabled. Using Ctrl-C while the
       program was running had the nasty  habit  of  leaving the speaker ON
       even after exiting the program. This is NOT a desirable feature.

       Please continue reading, the EXAMPLES are next.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       PAGE 3

            4)      tones begin  ending  [/S:sec]  [/I:inc]  [/C:cnt]
                          Hertz  Hertz   How long   Hertz    Count

       The EXAMPLES provided are just so you can begin to get a feel of how
       the tones parameters  work. Remember that you can  try  any  set  of
       parameters that you want and if you DO NOT LIKE them, just press the
       Esc button on your keyboard.

       Delta:          0.1 to 3 Hz.
                       The Delta  level  is normally associated with a deep
                       dreamless sleep, trance  state,  and non-REM type of
                       sleep.
       Theta:          3 to 7 Hz.
                       The Theta level is normally associated  with recall,
                       fantasy, imagery,  creativity,  inspiration,  future
                       planning, dreaming,    switching    thoughts,    and
                       drowsiness.
       Alpha:          7 to 13 Hz.
                       The Alpha level is associated with  a non-drowsy but
                       relaxed, tranquil  state of consciousness, primarily
                       with pleasant     inward     awareness;    body/mind
                       integration.
       Beta:           13 to 30 Hz.
                       The Beta level is associated with outward awareness,
                       the taking  in  and evaluating of various  forms  of
                       data received through the senses; it is present with
                       worry, anger, fear, hunger, and surprise.
       High Beta:      30 to 500 Hz.
                       The High Beta level is not associated currently with
                       any state  of mind. Some effects have been observed,
                       but currently not  enough  research has been done in
                       this area, to prove, or disprove, anything.
