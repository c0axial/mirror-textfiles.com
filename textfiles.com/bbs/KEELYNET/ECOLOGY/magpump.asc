The following is from a document I received several years ago from an unknown
source.  The article is from the January, 1966, Popular Science magazine and
I only have one page, but the gist is well stated.  I think it is very similar
to the 'caterpillar drive' that was used in the movie, "Hunt for Red October".

                      Silent Sea Engine for Nuclear Subs
                               by James G. Busse

           A magnetic pump with no moving parts, this simple device
           may propel our submarines silently along the ocean floor

In the silent world of underwater warfare, the slightest noise can bring
sudden death to a submarine.  The electronic ears of the enemy can detect
conventional engines and screw propellers as far as 100 miles away.  A
computer intercepts the sounds and directs a deadly homing torpedo to their
source in minutes.  How do you go about maneuvering a 3,260-ton nuclear
submarine without making a sound?  Two medical researchers at St. Louis
University's School of Medicine may have found the answer - a revolutionary
undersea propulsion unit dubbed the "sea engine."

The interesting phenomenon upon which the sea engine is based was first
observed in 1964 by Alfred W. Richardson, a physiologist, and Sujoy K. Guha, a
young biomedical engineer from India.  The two men were looking for a method
of simulating the flow of blood through the human body.  They tried various
types of mechanical pumps without success.  The pumping action was too
irregular.

While investigating the effects of magnetic fields on weak salt solutions
similar to blood, the two researchers stumbled across an interesting fact:
They could make the electrically charged atoms in such solutions move in one
direction by applying a magnetic field in just the right way.  Then they made
a second important discovery:  The moving atoms dragged water molecules along
with them so that the entire solution moved.

Richardson and Guha suddenly realized that they had the makings of a new type
of pump.  They quickly assembled an experimental model and found, as they had
expected, that the device really worked.  Their "pump" consisted of nothing
more than an unimpressive collection of junk-box electronic components.  Yet
the instant they connected it to a source of electrical power, a weak salt
solution inside it began to move.

A number of tests were made and new models were constructed, some of which
permitted very accurate control over the quantity of liquid being pumped, and
others which made the liquid move in a series of pulses, duplicating the
pumping action of the human heart.  Amazingly, the pumps could move a variety
of liquids - including ordinary tap water - without difficulty.....
