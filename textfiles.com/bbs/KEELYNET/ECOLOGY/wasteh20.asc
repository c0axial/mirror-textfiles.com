  I would like  any input on anyone who has information on using magnets for
  water treatment. I visited a swimming pool where the owner claims that his
  hardness and alkalinity problems were  solved  by  the  installation  of a
  magnet around the  water  line going to the showers in the  bathhouse  and
  into the swimming  pool.  I  have  read that studies on magnets have shown
  that they align the charge on ions in  water. For wastewater studies, this
  would be a benefit were a person using an UV light after  a  sand  filter.
  Before wastewater is  processed  through  a  UV  light,  the  magnet could
  decrease the amount of hardness and  scaling  in  the UV reactor (i.e. the
  teflon tube or  quartz  tube)  Has  anyone ever tried this  before?  I  am
  thinking of trying  it,  but  I would like to obtain research funds to try
  it?  Can anyone help me on this ? Scaling  could  cause  a  buildup on the
  exterior of a quartz tube or on the interior of a teflon  tube which would
  decrease the efficiency  of  the  UV  light. Magnet researchers make other
  fabulous claims also, such as the strength  of  the  magnet  would  have a
  positive effect on the decrease of pathogenic material  which  would  make
  them easier to  kill  under  a  UV  light ? Believe it or not ? Baloney or
  remarkably true ( can I get this to  be  on  UNSOLVED  MYSTERIES on NBC ?)
  Anyway, in all seriousness, please leave a message for  me  on this BBS if
  you care to comment.

  I am currently  considering adding onto a single resident sewage treatment
  plant that I am building soon (when  my  regulatory  agency  approves  the
  permits) the use  of  a  UV  light  as  the  primary disinfectant  device.
  Although I am  worried about the build up of the scale and other debris on
  the teflon tube over many years, I am  going  to  use  magnets to keep the
  scale off. A large swimming pool nearby used a 11,000 gauss strength

                                    Page 1





  magent on the  water  main leading into his showers. After installation of
  the magnets, the build up of scale decreased  significantly.  I  am hoping
  that the same will occur on the UV light that I am planning  to  use. I am
  planning to use a Model 12L from Northland Technologies.

  Anyone who has used this light for disinfection after a buried sand filter
  should kindly leave  a  note  of  their  own personal experiences with it.
  Also, written research exists about  the  strength  of  magnets  on  water
  treatment. I will be installing one between my septic tank  and  my dosing
  tank which feeds  wastewater  into the buried sand filter. Maybe this will
  assist with the  activity level of the  positive  and  negatively  charged
  particles entering into the sand filter.  Separating the  two  charges out
  before the sand  filter  may help the sand filter work better. (note: I am
  using three 500 gallon septic tanks -  the  magnet will be in place on the
  last septic tank)  Anyway,  this  all  may seem crazy,  but  I  will  keep
  everyone informed. . .

  Some time ago  I  requested  information  on  using magnets for wastewater
  treatment. I was installing a new septic  system  for  my  home  and I was
  looking for ways to increase the efficiency of this proposed system. The
  system has been installed since 11/91.

  The system consists  of  3 septic tanks, a dosing chamber  with  a  sewage
  pump, a sand filter, and a UV light which leads into an 810 foot discharge
  line. Magnets were  placed  before the third septic tank. The third septic
  tank also contains a ZABEL filter which  helps  reduce the solids going on
  the sand filter.   Magnets were also placed before and  after  the  dosing
  chamber. A magnet  was also placed before the UV light. The results of the
  first test as required on my NPDES permit are:

               CBOD = 2 mg/l
   Suspended Solids = 6 mg/l
                 ph = 7
     fecal coliform = or < 10 colonies/100 ml of sample.

  I am really pleased with the results  of  my test since they are about 85%
  to 90% below the lower limits set for my effluents on my NPDES permits.  I
  give credit to my success partially to the magnets because I do think they
  help reduce the solids and keep the UV reactor chamber  clean  so that the
  UV light works  properly.  I  will  be  asking how other systems which are
  somewhat comparable to mine are doing.  I  would reccommend magnets to any
  person or desinger because I do beleive they help reduce  solids  and they
  maximize the amount  of  settling of solids in the septic tanks. The other
  part of my system I would like to comment  on  is  the  UV  light.  It has
  worked wonderfully. Compared  to  using  chlorine  tablets,   it  is  more
  effective, cheaper to  operate, and nontoxic to the receiving stream which
  carries away my wastewater. However,  if  anyone wants to use one, I would
  suggest they overcompensate the flow on a UV light to  allow  for  greater
  kill of pathogens  in  the  effluent  coming from the sand filter. Another
  nice thing about the UV light is that  it  is  much  more convient for the
  homeowner. The homeowner  never  has  to  keep checking  on  the  chlorine
  tablets which can sometimes bridge up in the tablet chlorinator. Please

  Do you have any control data from the system obtained before you installed
  the magnets? If so how does the data  compare to the present setup? Why do
  you feel the  magnets  are  contributing  to a lower solids  loss  in  the
  effluent? Why do you feel they contribute to a lower solids buildup on the
  UV chamber walls? I'm interested in your results but still very skeptical.
  I remember some salesman trying to sell these things for the fuel lines of
  my furnace to " polarize " the molecules of fuel for a more efficient burn
  but he could not supply any backup to his claims beyond presenting a vague
  theory.

  My answers to your questions are as follows:
    1. Control Data consists of comparing similiar systems installed without
       any magnets.  These  systems  have  a  variable difference of 5 to 10
       percent increase in solids over what my results are coming out with.
    2. The electromagnetic field initiates a charge (note that the charge is
       somewhat weak) on the effluent. The charge lines up all negative and
       positive charges in a fashion that  slows  down  the ongoing movement
       between negative and positive charges in the various  elements in the
       effluent. Scaling  on  the reactor wall of the UV chamber takes place
       because the reactor wall itself  has  charges  on  it  which  attract
       minerals with opposite charges which leads to scaling  which  in turn
       leads to  the  UV  light  from  penetrating  the  effluent. Also, the
       magnets I used were also placed  on the septic tanks. The "lining up"
       of charges in a large tank also contributes to increased flocullation
       in the  tank  because the charges placed upon the effluent  are  only
       small and somewhat temporary, BUT this temporary charge effect allows
       all "unline  charges" in the septic tank to cluster around the "lined
       charges" which in turn leads to increased flocullation or clumping of
       solids coming together.

  This summer I was inspected by a PADER  Inspector  who  is  doing a summer
  study on single resident sewage treatment plants. Her data being collected
  on these systems seem to indicate that this addition of  magnets  seems to
  assist in better  performance  of  this  single  resident sewage treatment
  plant. Her data has not all been collected  yet.  She  will  have a report
  which will be done at the end of the summer.

  You may think this is a vague theory, yet I was introduced to this concept
  of magnetics and sewage through a few scientific journals  devoted  to the
  study of electromagnetism.  A  friend of mine is a magnet hobbyist, and he
  gave me the  address  of  a  man  in Minnesasota  who  has  all  kinds  of
  information about magnets. I wrote to him about magnets and sewage, and

                                    Page 3





  his reponse was  to  send  an  article  from a scientific journal which is
  published in Germany. This journal  (I  can't  give  you  the  name  of it
  because it is  in  German) discussed research done on water  treatment  in
  Russia. All of  the  concepts  I  have discussed here in this reply to you
  were in this article.

  BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I WAS VERY SKEPTICAL  TOO..YET  IT DOES SEEM TO WORK !!
  How effiently it  works  is another question. If I had the  resources,  it
  would be insteresting  to  note  what effect would take place if one could
  vary the strength of the electromagnetic charge..More Research needs to be
  done.  I hope this interests you.

  I would like to know if anyone has any  experience  with  the  addition of
  commercially prepared bacteria used for assisting the digestion  of sludge
  in septic tank  effluent.  Doews  it help at all in making the system work
  better ? Also, I have a sand filter for  filtering  the septage. Will this
  bacteria assist in establing a better culture of benefical  bacteria which
  will break down  the  wastewater  components better ? Thanks for your help
  and comments.
