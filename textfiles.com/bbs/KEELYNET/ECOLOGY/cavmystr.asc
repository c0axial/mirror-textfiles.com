       The following account appeared on page 52 of the Nov. 1954 issue
       of FATE magazine.  The article was titled 'GATE TO THE UNKNOWN':

            "In March,  1954,  a  French  Jesuit priest in Sorata, Bolivia,
       told a strange story of an exploring  trip he had made in the cavern
       of San Pedro on 20,000 foot Mount Illampu of the Andes chain.
            "The cavern  must  be  entered  on all fours through  a  narrow
       passage which widens  after  a  few  yards and leads into an immense
       cavern filled with stalagmites and  stalactites.   At one end of the
       cavern is a subterranean lake.
            "The French priest claimed to be the first person  to  cross to
       the far end of the lake.  After several hours of rowing a small boat
       by artificial light, he related, the cave narrowed and gave way to a
       trail barred by  an  enormous  gate of wrought iron.  The grille, he
       said, bore all the characteristics of 17th century Spanish ironwork.
            "The priest tried unsuccessfully  to break through the barrier.
       He was eager to see what lay beyond but he had to return  to  Sorata
       without solving the mystery."
            The question one might ask in this case is: Did the old Spanish
       explorers go through  all  the trouble to forge the gate in order to
       keep someone out, or did they do it to keep some 'thing' in...?

       In the Fall, 1980 issue of 'SEARCH' magazine (p. 7) the following
       strange incident was reported:

            "A MILE OF LIGHTS -- Four teenagers, quite 'shook up', drove up
       to Deputy Sheriff Trotta in Putnam  County,  New  York  State, about
       1:30 a.m. one morning, and said they had seen an 'eerie sight' at an
       abandoned iron ore mine in nearby Brewster.
            "Trotta thought  their  explanation did, indeed,  sound  rather
       'eerie', so he got another police officer to accompany him.
            "They went to the mine shaft which was on a dirt road, off from
       another road, known as 'Lover's Lane'.
            "Going into  the  mine,  they  found  two 'long rows of lighted
       candles as far as the eye could see'.   The  two  officers  followed
       them for about a mile.  Then the trail of light suddenly  came to an
       end, and that was that."

       Some of the early Indian inhabitants of Connecticut held a legend of
       a large subterranean  chamber  which  was supposed to lie deep below
       the surface of their tribal lands.   Within  this large chamber, the
       legend states, a powerful demon or evil one sat upon a throne.

       Perhaps such legends were built around actual phenomena  such as was
       described by Horace  C.  Hovey  in  his  book  'CELEBRATED  AMERICAN
       CAVERNS' (Robert Clarke & Co., Cincinnati.,  1896).   On pp. 199-200
       of this volume,  under  the sub-heading 'THE MOODUS  NOISES',  Hovey
       states:

            "Certain inexplicable  sounds have mystified the inhabitants of
       a portion of the Connecticut valley  for  more than a century.  From
       the fact that they were first heard at Moodus, a quite little hamlet
       beside a trout stream, they have been called the Moodus  Noises.  In
       1729 these detonations   were   so  remarkable  as  to  have  caused
       consternation.  A clergyman of the day writes:

       'Whether they be any thing diabolical in these things I know not,
       but this I know, that God Almighty is to be seen and trembled at.'

       'I myself,' he  adds,  'heard  8  or  10  sounds  successively,  and
       imitating small arms, in the space of 5 minutes.  I have, I suppose,
       heard several hundred of them within 20 years, still more, some less
       terrible.  Oftentimes I have heard them to be coming  down  from the
       north, imitating slow  thunder, which shakes the houses and all that
       is in them.'
            "These strange sounds have  been  recently  heard,  as  late as
       1881, at Salem,  Conn., New London and elsewhere,  and  have  caused
       renewed interest in  the  subject.  Their starting point seems to be
       Mount Tom, and  in  March, 1881,  it  is  affirmed  that  the  faint
       rumbling sound rising to a rattling peal was heard for several hours
       and by many people.  The reason for referring to them  here is that,
       in the opinion  of  some  persons  the  Moodus  Noises  are  due  to
       explosions of gases  in  subterranean  cavities,  and  indicate  the
       existence of a large vacuity underneath Southern New  England, which
       would not be  suspected by a survey of the granite hills and smiling
       prosperity of the region thus threatened."

       The following article, written by  Alex  Sanders and titled 'HAUNTED
       CAVES', appeared in the Oct. 1961 issue of SEARCH Magazine:

            "Why (this question has been put to Shaver many times) have not
       our extensive mines of coal, silver, iron, gold,  etc.  broken  into
       your alleged 'caverns'?   Shaver  has answered (as he does in SHAVER
       MYSTERY MAGAZINE number 2 - page 27) that 'The caves are deeper than
       miners penetrate - and they are led  away  when  they  get too near.
       Mines are too dangerous - many mines are "haunted", no one will work
       in them.'
            "This brings to mind a CORONET Magazine article  - 'THE PHANTOM
       OF BUCK HILL CAVES' from the June, 1951 issue.
            "J. P.  Folinsbee, the author, tells about Virginia's Buck Hill
       Caverns, 'a vast  underground kingdom  that,  once  discovered,  has
       never been fully explored.'  Unlike the NEARBY world-famous Natural

       Bridge which annually  attracts some 500,000 tourists, the place was
       never opened to the public.
            "Unknown is the founder of the  entrance,  but  back  in 1889 a
       schoolboy named Jake Fitzgeralds did limited exploration  around the
       surface opening, alone or with friends.
            "Then, in  October  (here  I  am  not sure if it was October of
       1889, or years later when Jake was  an  adult)  a Col. Henry Parsons
       who had heard tales of the strange beauty underground,  talked  Jake
       into entering the cave, for a dollar a day, to tell what he found.
            "A few  days  later,  armed  with oil lanterns, candles, ropes,
       chisels, Jake disappeared inside with  his  brother, Joe, as a small
       crowd watched curiously.
            "Hours later  the  two  muddy  figures returned,  to  whet  the
       appetite of Col.  Parsons with their spine-tingling description of a
       miles-long, extravagantly beautiful cavern.
            "The following  week,  an eight-man  crew  began  the  task  of
       opening Buck Hill Caverns.
            "Discounting millions  of  bats,  it was enormously  impressive
       inside, what with  vast  chambers,  a  frozen,  majestically-hanging
       waterfall, a crystal lake, weird stone  formations, huge stalagmites
       and stalactites to take one's breath away.
            "Months passed, then one full year, of steady work.
            "Probing with a pick, Jake broke through a wall  of  flowstone.
       Enlarging the hole,  his lantern shining within revealed a seemingly
       endless pit.
            "Quickly a rope lowered him down.  Pulled back over the edge an
       hour later, the white-faced Jake excitedly  described  the unearthly
       magnificence of waterfalls,  pools,  lakes,  vast   chambers,   even
       [stone] cave flowers.
            "The unparalleled sights were verified the next day by the awed
       workers.  Still, the  place was never open to the public.  Because -
       one day the crew stopped their downward  digging  abruptly,  for  no
       reason at all, remaining oddly silent.  For there  came  'a  sobbing
       cry, uncannily like  the  wracking voice of a woman, floating eerily
       up from the chasm.  It stopped.   Then  it  came  again,  in a long,
       moaning sigh that rose like a sob of pain.'
            "What was it?  A woman crying (perhaps a prisoner  in some deep
       underground dungeon? -  Branton)  as  she  lay  down there?  A HAUNT
       warning the men to depart (as one 'suggested' half-hysterically)?
            "They left - fast! - and as they ran silently, a second sobbing
       wail echoed behind them.
            "The men refused to return after  that,  though  Jake tried for
       weeks to get  them back to work.  Others refused as  well  once  the
       story of the  Phantom  of the Caves spread through the superstitious
       mountain country.  Buck  Hill  Cavern,  a  possible  million  dollar
       wonderland, was necessarily abandoned.
            "When the  CORONET  article  was written in 1951,  white-haired
       Jake Fitzgeralds was  still alive, the only man living who had heard
       the phantom voice.  He resided then  in  an  ancient  long  house at
       Bell's Cove, a few miles from Buck Hill.
            "What was the strange nose heard far below the  earths crust by
       a team of  workers over seventy years ago?  Was it a freak waterfall
       sucking air in some hole?  This Jake offered as an explanation.
            "Or - deros at work, as Richard  Shaver  might say, to keep the
       curious away?"

       remote mountain in South America.   Deep in the cave he came upon an

       strange creature like  the  serpent  of Loch Ness itself, raised its
       long neck out of the water and let  out a cave-shuddering roar.  The

       same mountain and cavern, only to  discover  that  a  'cave-in'  had
       completely sealed the entrance to the underground lake.

       'Commander X', in his book 'UNDERGROUND ALIEN BASES' (Abelard Press.
       New York) described one incident which was originally related in one
       of the 'SHAVER MYSTERY' publications which were prominent during the
       1950's.
            The incident  was reported by a 'Professor W. Wiers' of Mexico,
       who stated that he knew of a 'Professor  Schwartz'  who  had  made a
       long study of cavern anomalies, starting when he was  only  15 years
       old in Germany.   According  to  Professor  Weirs,  just  before the
       beginning of the Second World War,  both  the axis and allied powers
       were interested in using various caves as supply bases  for numerous
       military applications.  At  this  time,  it is said, the Nazi's were
       secretly exploring caverns and old  mines in the Southwestern United
       States, the Himalayas,   South  America,  the  Polar   regions   and
       elsewhere.
            Professor Schwartz  related that he knew of a Nazi who had come
       upon an 'enormous circular pit' whose  sides  dropped  straight down
       for a good  1,200  feet.   Trees  could  be  seen growing  tall  and
       straight below.  Eagles  soared around, and then dived to the bottom
       of the chasm, apparently eating something.   Since  the  sides  were
       dangerously steep the  Nazi  had  to  content  himself   with  using
       binoculars instead of descending into the underground realm himself.
            Returning later   with  others  (fellow  German  soldiers?)  he
       eventually discovered a similar but  much  narrower  shaft,  not far
       from the first, which was so big that it could not  be hidden in any
       way to those  in  the  general  vicinity.   Not  having  a cable nor
       apparatus with which to let down a man into the seemingly bottomless
       shaft, they let down a pencil attached  to  a thin rope or cord.  To
       their surprise, the cord, when drawn back up was  found  to  be  cut
       clean, as with  a  knife,  or scissors--and the pencil was gone.  Of
       course they all resolved to come  back  and  study this pit further,
       but the war prevented their doing so.
            The location of the shaft is supposedly in Northern  Guatemala.
       Near the place  is  a  witch doctor, friendly to Professor Schwartz,
       who assured the Professor that there is a secret passage, closed by

       a revolving rock  door,  which  goes  to  an enormous hidden chamber
       which is still below the vast roof cave-in seen from above.
            Some years  ago  researcher   Penny   Harper   visited  eastern
       Guatemala and learned  of  a  strange cavern called  'Silpino'  cave
       which had a legendary history.  This caverns entrance was right next
       to a major  road.   It  is  uncertain  whether this road was the one
       running from Zacapa  to  Puerto Barrios  or  another  similar  road.
       However, this cavern was said to be an ancient MAYAN cave. Explorers
       have claimed that ancient Mayan artifacts and carvings  can  be seen
       deep within the  cave, and at one point the electrical cells in some
       of the explorers' flashlights were  mysteriously  drained.   One man
       claimed he traveled for MANY days through the passage  and  came out
       at the bottom  of the central shaft of an extinct volcano.  He could
       see a pinpoint of light entering through  the upper cone high above,
       and an underground stream with strange subterranean  fish  meandered
       through the cavernous  maze.   Another  man  entered  the  cave  and
       returned about a  month  later,  his  body  swollen  from  weeks  of
       wandering in the damp underground tunnels.  These accounts  at least
       suggest that the  ancient  Mayans  had  a  definite  interest in the
       'subterranean' world.

            "...Out of  the  clear  skies  of  Utah,  in  June, 1947 came a
       strange inquiry about reputed caverns near Syracuse, N.Y.  Miss Opal
       Kemp of 220 Canyon Road, Salt Lake  City, made the inquiry, first to
       the Syracuse Chamber of Commerce, then to the Secretary of the State
       of Albany, and finally to me, through the circulation  of one of her
       letters to officials of the State Museum and the State Department of
       Conservation, who had  the  idea  that  a spelunker from Pittsfield,
       Massachusetts, would know about it if anyone did.
            "Miss Kemp had written that  'a  group  of  us  are planning to
       visit the east this summer and wish to explore caverns  known as THE
       EAST CAVES OF  SYRACUSE.   These  caves  are  said to be the western
       entrance to the  subterranean  passage   which  extended  under  the

       collapsed--one as recently has 1928--so that it is now impossible to
       travel in them.  However, the entrances remain intact.'
            "It took   but  a  few  minutes  of  research  in  the  geology
       department of the State Museum to  discover  that there actually are
       some caves east of Syracuse, and that they are curious ones, indeed,
       and deep and  some  of them quite long, for in THE  GEOLOGY  OF  THE
       SYRACUSE QUADRANGLE by  Thomas Cramer Hopkins, published as NEW YORK
       STATE MUSEUM BULLETIN 171m in 1914,  there  was  found  not  only an
       elaborate study of  the  'EAST CAVES OF SYRACUSE,'  but  photographs
       taken, exteriorly, of  some of the odd crevices, with people perched
       in them.
            "These crevices are in Onondaga limestone, which is the hardest
       kind found in New York State and  which  spreads  clear  across  the
       Syracuse quadrangle, in some areas forming large,  level  floors  of
       rock swept free  of  residual  matter  by  glaciers  and the wash of
       water, and with deep clefts in the rock.
            "One of the areas lies along  the  top  of a cliff that borders
       what is known  as the Clark Reservation, a state park,  about  three
       miles southeast of Syracuse.  As Professor Hopkins describes them,
            "'..At the  Syracuse  caves, three miles southeast of the city,
       some of these fissure caverns have  been explored to a depth of more
       than a hundred feet and some hundreds of feet in length.   Where the
       fissuring has been  intensified  it  produces the well-known KARSTEN
       topography.
            "'In a few places there has been a little deposition of calcite
       on the walls of the fissures, but  in general the deposition is very
       slight in comparison with the solution since most  of  the  material
       dissolved has been carried away into the streams or deposited in the
       deeper portions of the underlying rocks.
            "'Some of  the  fissures  are  open enough at the top to permit
       large quantities of snow to enter them during the winter months, and
       remain in the form of snow and ice  during  the  greater part of the
       summer, forming what  is  known  locally as the 'ice  caves.'  These
       occur in cliffs around Blue Lake and at Split Rock quarries.'
            "This officially  confirms  Miss  Kemp's  long-distance  tip on
       caves which, until June, 1947, had  completely escaped the attention
       of present-day geologists, speleologists, and spelunkers  as well as
       the usually alert  boosters  of  the  Syracuse  Chamber of Commerce,
       which brings us  to  the  inland   and   western  entrance  to  that
       prodigious reputed trans-ocean subway from the United  States to the
       British Isles!  But where, oh where is the other end."
            At this  point  in  his  book Mr. Perry referred to a cavern in
       France which was at the time of that  writing measured to a depth of
       over 2,193 feet.  The cave is known as the 'Great  Hole  of  Preta',
       near Verona.  However,   since  that  time  far  deeper  caves  have
       'officially' been explored and documented.   In THE GUINNESS BOOK OF
       WORLD RECORDS, we find that the cave system known as  the 'Reseau du
       Foillis' had been explored in France to a depth exceeding 4600 feet.
       New 'depth' records   are   'officially'  being  broken  every  day,
       however.  Perry continues: "...But  America  may  find that it holds
       the record for the longest cave in the world beneath  its  land,  if
       these 'East Caves of Syracuse' do now or ever did extend from cliffs
       of the Syracuse  area  across  under the ocean to the British Isles,
       for it is  some two hundred miles  from  Syracuse  to  the  Atlantic
       Coast.
            "It develops that the Geology Department of Syracuse University
       made some study of the caves, and that parties of students,  with an
       instructor, used to  explore  the  deep  cliffs,  using  ropes,  and
       actually have gone down as deep as 100 feet in them.  Among those

       Helen C. Gordon, in a letter which appeared in the  'SHAVER  MYSTERY
       MAGAZINE', Vol. 1,  No.  2,  1947,  pp.  3234.,  described a strange
       experience she and  her  husband had  with  a  massive  subterranean
       cavern below southern New Mexico.
            While driving near the Organ mountains southeast of Las Cruces,
       the two had spotted what seemed to be mine tailings  high  upon  the
       forbidden-looking slopes.  Being a bit curious and adventurous, they
       decided to spend  some  time  and  walk  up the mountains and see if
       there were any mines as they suspected from the tailing piles.  They
       finally reached the entrance to what they knew to be a mine, perhaps
       excavated sometime in the 1800's,  and  proceeded  to  explore  it's
       interior.  They made their way back into the dark interior,  feeling
       their way along.   They  continued  farther still until the entrance
       was a mere pinpoint of light, and  suddenly  they  noticed  that the
       right wall had  disappeared  into  empty blackness.   A  natural  or
       artificial 'wall' or partition blocked off most of the 'empty area',
       which spanned a   considerable   distance  along  the  side  of  the
       horizontal mine.  Just behind the  'wall'  a  narrow ledge ran along
       the top of what seemed to be a chasm.
            The chasm was deeper than their lights could reach and appeared
       to be more  of a natural result of some ancient geological  activity
       rather than artificial.   They  looked  around  for  some  wood  and
       combustible material and  constructed   a  torch,  which  they  then
       dropped down the  pit.  They watched fearfully and  in  awe  as  the
       torch light became  smaller  and  smaller  until it disappeared from
       view altogether.
            After questioning some of the  old  timers  in  the  area  they
       learned that such  chasms  were  encountered  on rare  occasions  by
       miners, who referred  to  them  as 'glory holes'.  A glory hole is a
       natural shaft of  such  depth  and   expanse  that  it's  bottom  is
       difficult to plumb.  The old miners apparently broke through to this
       'glory hole' and  left  the partition of the rock there  for  safety
       purposes.

          This interesting  file  might  lead to a understanding of what is
          being called "the Taos Hum".   If  underground  caverns are being
          opened up,  whether  naturally or artificially,  and  wind  whips
          through these  caverns,  very  low frequency sounds (difficult to
          detect without special equipment)  with  an  omnipresent  pattern
          might be  created.  The 60 minute special on this  pointed  to  a
          giant mineshaft  ventilation  fan  as  a possible culprit but the
          actual sound is still not resolved.
