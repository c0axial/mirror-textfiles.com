                Here's an interesting bit of information, from the
                 "Texas Co-Op Power" - Sept. 1993, issue, entitled

                    "Israeli Electric Wind Extinguishes Fires".

       A novel, more  environmentally  sound method for extinguishing fires
       uses electricity instead of chemicals or water.

       The Technology, being  marketed  by  a  Tel-Aviv  firm,  directs  an
       intense electrical field and/or gaseous plasma to  the  base  of the
       fire.  An "electric  wind"  cools  the  area  in which combustion is
       occurring.  The process also inhibits the fire's fuel supply.

       The technology should avoid some of  the drawbacks of existing fire-
       fighting equipment, such as ozone damage to the environment, hazards
       to operating personnel,  noise,  and  a  high rate  of  costly  fire
       alarms.

       A technical paper  describing  the new process was presented in late
       May by co-inventor Esther Jacobson to a meeting of the National Fire
       Prevention Association in Orlando.

       The equipment uses  only  1000  volts   of   electricity  during  an
       extinguishing operation, according to Jacobson.

       Spectrex Inc. of   Cedar  Grove,  NJ,  a  subsidiary   of   Israel's
       Spectronix Ltd., is  looking  for a strategic partner in the U.S. to
       help it find suitable applications.

       Vangard Note..

          It is amazingly coincidental that  Norman,  Bert  and some others
          brought the principle of electrostatic quenching  of  fires up at
          our last   Roundtable.    The   discussion   noted  that  with  a
          sufficiently intense ion flow  (negative,  I  believe), a propane
          torch could  be  directed  at  a  flammable mass  having  such  a
          "shield" and it would not burn or even get hot.

          Various theories were brought up regarding this phenomenon, among
          them :
                 1)  That heat and fire must be of an electromagnetic

                                      Page 1





                     nature and  thus involve frequency(ies) because of the
                     "interference" of the  energy  by  this  turbulent ion
                     wind,

                 2)  that the ion wind acted to displace  the  oxygen  from
                     the immediate   vicinity  and  so  cut  off  the  fuel
                     necessary to sustain combustion

          We have  not  seen any reports  on  this  subject  as  to  actual
          experiments.  These would make a great demonstration and/or video
          and possibly lead to practical devices (portable?)  like  the one
          described in the above article.

          In some  of our experiments with a large Tesla coil, it was noted
          that an ionic wind did seem to  be  projected  as the electricity
          streamed from pointed fingers or arms.  At that  time, we did not
          think about this being an opportunity to do some experiments.

          However, one  of the stunts used in our ZAP show was to hold up a
          torch handle containing paper,  then  momentarily  switch  on the
          coil.  This  caused  the  paper  to  flame  up  but  it  did  NOT
          extinguish it, possibly because of the short duration burst.

          On leaving  the platform after allowing the electricity to course
          over the skin, you could smell  ozone from your skin for a couple
          of hours.  There was also a spider web feeling as if some kind of
          clinging sheet was attached to you.  The only other  thing I have
          ever felt  that was like this, was when you hang your arm over an
          open car window on a warm day.   The wind seems to place a charge
          on the arm and you will feel a similar feeling where  it  tingles
          and has  this  kind  of static web.  Perhaps this is what happens
          with this electrostatic field,  it forms a kind of web or matrix.
          Try it yourself.

          If a  mass  could be sufficiently charged, perhaps  this  is  one
          approach to  CAUSING  THE  MASS  ITSELF TO PROJECT THE WIND, thus
          protecting it from flame and heat  by  both turbulence and oxygen
          displacement.
