    Green foliage gives  off  an  invisible  deep red - almost black -
    light detectable by sensitive IR equipment and films.

    This has been found to be one of the most fundamental processes of
    life and is directly associated with photosynthesis.

    The initial discovery was made  by  biologists  at  the  Oak Ridge
    Laboratory of the Atomic Energy Commission while  studying changes
    in a chemical  known  as  adonesine  triphosphate  (ADT) in plants
    engaged in photosynthesis.

    Photosynthesis takes place in the  presence  of  light  and is the
    formation of starches  and  sugars  from  soil-held  hydrogen  and
    atmospheric carbon.

    Extracts from the bodies of fireflies give off a bright light when
    the chemical ADT  is  present.  ADT is also an important source of
    energy in muscles.

    Chloroplasts, the parts   of    plants   which   carry   out   the
    photosynthesis process, give  off  light when mixed  with  firefly
    juice and illuminated.

    Surprisingly enough, they also found that living extracts of
    green plants give off a light of their own without any mixing.

    The light given  off by the chloroplasts is now believed to be the
    exact opposite of the first chemical step in photosynthesis.

    Unstable chemical bonds are formed  within the plant when light is
    absorbed by the chloroplasts.  Small portions of  these chemically
    induced compounds recombine  to liberate energy that is eventually
    trapped by the chlorophyll molecule, which is the true radiator of
    the mysterious light.

    Leaves, if frozen while being exposed to illumination, will retain
    their light-producing ability for  several  months.   In addition,
    certain extracts prepared  from  leaves  being  exposed  to  light
    contain substances which  give  off  a  bright  light when certain
    chemicals are added to them.
