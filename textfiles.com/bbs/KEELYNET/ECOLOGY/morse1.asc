     The Morse water technology combines several well known water treatment
     strategies with the  additional  principle  of  harmonic  resonance to
     create a system that is relatively  simple,  inexpensive  to build and
     operate and widely applicable.

     This technology has  revolutionary potential for the  water  treatment
     industry.

     It can be  used,  in  different  configurations,  for  drinking water,
     industrial process waters and waste waters.

     The attached FLOW DIAGRAM shows, the major components of the design as
     follows:

                          1)  ozone diffusion
                          2)  ultraviolet radiation
                          3)  harmonic resonance stimulation
                          4)  separation of contaminant side streams

     With regard to components 1 and 2,  the  Morse  system  should  not be
     identified with existing  water treatment systems utilizing  ozone  or
     ultraviolet light.

     While these components    are   well   established   water   treatment
     strategies, in this  technology   their   purpose  is  to  create  the
     catalytic conditions for improved harmonic stimulation and separation.

     Of course, in certain treatment problems, such as bacterial  or  virus
     removal and reduction  of chemical or biological oxygen demand (COD or
     BOD), the effects  created  by ultraviolet  light  and  ozone  can  be
     significant in themselves.

     Of greater importance for the Morse process, however,  is the creation
     of peroxide ions  and the photocatalytic effects of ultraviolet light.
     There is currently  active  discussion   of   the  potential  of  such
     strategies in the theoretical literature.

     The underlying principle  of  the  Morse  technology   is  that  every
     chemical element, and  as  a  result  every combination of elements in
     chemical compounds, has a characteristic resonant frequency.


     Therefore, stimulating a material at  the resonant frequency of one of
     its components can  enable control over that component  and  can  even
     cause overall changes  in  the  material.   This result is achieved in
     components 3 and 4 listed above.

     The harmonic signals  are  tuneable  in both power and frequency.  The
     separator towers are   tuned  to   attract   and   concentrate   water
     impurities.

     The exact details of how the Morse technology works  are  proprietary,
     but its achievement is to enable resonant stimulation and control with
     relatively simple equipment  and at low energy costs.  Therefore, both
     capital and operating costs are low.

     Further, the range of applications  is  very  broad  since the process
     relies on direct  elemental  stimulation  rather  than   on   specific
     chemical or physical   interactions   that   only   sometimes   enable
     contaminant removal.

     Additional information relating to  some of the Morse technologies has
     been gleaned from   conversations  with  various  persons   personally
     conversant with Morse,  the man as well as certain Proprietary aspects
     of his processes.

     We feel the Morse system should be  of  PRIMARY IMPORTANCE to everyone
     from an ecological  standpoint.   For  that  reason,  we  include  the
     following VANGARD DERIVED  information  with  this  paper  to help the
     reader to understand how they might  utilize this technology for their
     own personal uses.

     Walter Russell and Bruce Cathie both have come to the  conclusion that
     there are a  total  of  144  elements  in  Nature.  This has also been
     calculated by Mr. Chips Morse.

     In addition, Mr. Morse has derived  a  resonant  frequency for each of
     these elements.  Many of the frequencies have been proven and are used
     in the aforementioned water purification system.

     We of Vangard Sciences, in conjunction with our Associates, have found
     a periodic relationship of the elements in the Kilocycle range.

     Mr. Morse uses  Nanometer  frequencies  (10 to the negative 9th) which
     come under the dominion of what are termed RADAR frequencies.

     There is also the possibility of using  MASER  radiations, but this is
     unlikely due to the difficulty in achieving and maintaining any degree
     of stability with MASER cavities.

     Keely says that the water molecule has a resonant frequency  of 42,800
     cycles per second.   Mr.  Keely  proved  this by dissociating water to
     instantaneously generate up to 30,000  pounds  per  square inch from 3
     drops of water.

     We have information regarding the Morse technologies which indicates a
     device capable of  remotely  scanning  a  building or  vehicle  for  a
     particular element of   combination.   These  frequencies  can  be  so
     modulated as to alter the molecular structure of the scanned mass from
     a distance.

     An example, if  a  vehicle  were   to   be  scanned  for  the  complex
     frequencies which would indicate the presence of Cocaine,  certain  of
     those frequencies could  be  re-transmitted  to the target which would
     cause the Cocaine to alter on a molecular  level  to  a  semi-toxic or
     unconsumable form.  This could all be done without the  driver  of the
     vehicle from knowing that he had been "scanned".

     We understand that  the CUSTOMS SERVICE was contacted for possible use
     of this technology in the Drug War,  however,  they declined to accept
     it.

     At the 1989  2nd Keely Conference in Colorado Springs  we  of  VANGARD
     SCIENCES released information  which might assist in the understanding
     of how sound  waves  could  be so  projected  or  applied  to  a  mass
     structure as to dissociate, manifest or transmute a  mass  aggregation
     from one state to another.

     To Wit,

         Water (H2O) contains two parts hydrogen to one part oxygen.

         When the water is cooled sufficiently, it begins to crystallize to
         take the form of ice.

         When water is heated, it becomes vapor, then steam.

         In each of these phase changes, ice to water to vapor to steam,
          THE COMPONENTS (H & O) COMPRISING THE STRUCTURE DO NOT ALTER!

         We still have two parts hydrogen to one part oxygen.

                           What then does change??

            1)   GEOMETRY

                       the physical  geometry  of  the  molecular structure
                       changes with respect of one atom to another

            2)   PATTERNS OF MOTION

                       the movement of  each  atom  relative  to  the other
                       atoms also changes

            3)   ENERGY

                       the kinetic energy of the atoms changes

            4)   FREQUENCY

                       the relationship    (harmonics)    of   the   atomic
                       frequencies to   each   other  changes  due  to  the
                       physical and  energetic  alterations   in  the  mass
                       structure

     The Morse companies  are  located  in the Houston area in a small town
     called Needville.
