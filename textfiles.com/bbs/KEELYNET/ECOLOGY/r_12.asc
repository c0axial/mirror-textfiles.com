       Summer 1993 issue

       Under pressure from  the  Clean  Air Act to eliminate production and
       importation of R-12, DuPont, the worlds  largest  manufacturer of R-
       12, will phase out production by the end of 1994.

       At least 65% of 1993 vehicles and nearly every pre-1993 vehicle with
       air conditioning requires R-12. 150 MILLION CARS  AND  LIGHT  TRUCKS
       USE R-12.  THERE  IS NO "DROP IN REPLACEMENT" FOR R-12 and IT IS NOT
       PROBABLE THAT WE WILL SEE ONE.  Unless  something  is  done to relax
       the short sighted and arbitrary requirements of the  Clean  Air  Act
       you will have  to  roll  your windows down when your air-conditioner
       needs service.

       Auto makers are working on recommendations  to  convert  SOME of the
       late model cars.  To convert to the new R-134 will require replacing
       several major components, hoses, flushing with R-12  (of which there
       won't be any!) and replacement of O-ring seals.

       Your air-conditioner system  is  also more likely to leak due to the
       smaller molecular structure of R-134.   Cost  estimate  by  industry
       experts: $800.00  You  know  how  often estimates by  "experts"  are
       accurate.  Cost of  R-12  has  already quadrupled but R-134 is still
       several times more costly.

       There are as many studies that show  NO link between the Ozone layer
       and use of  clorofluorocarbons  as  there are that  suggest  such  a
       connection.  While the  Clean  Air  Act  has a noble title and lofty
       ambitions, it is yet another in a series of poorly thought out, knee
       jerk reaction, short sighted and "We'll all have to give a little"
       STUPID pieces of legislation.

       Of course the folks that made the  law  won't mind because they also
       give themselves enough  raises to be able to buy  new  cars  and  so
       won't be affected.  The  average age of a car in the US is between 7
       and 10 years.   These  vehicles will  either  not  be  eligible  for
       conversion or it will not be economically feasible to do so.

       You may safely  expect  a  similar fate for the R-22 that is in your
       home air-conditioning system and your refrigerator and your freezer,
       etc.
                                    ------
       Write your legislators NOW.  They  don't  always  listen  when  they
       should but if  the  owners  of 150 Million cars write,  WE  WILL  BE
       HEARD!

       Vangard Note

          This interesting  file confirms what we had heard many years ago.
          That the ecological "damage" allegedly  caused by freon and other
          CFC's is in fact a contrived event to precipitate  the FORCED USE
          of a much more costly "solution".

          This was  pointed  out a few years back in the file FUZZY1.ASC on
          KeelyNet.  A major study was done by the Japanese which found the
          greatest SINGLE pollutant was jet  fuel.   The emission from just
          one jet in a day's worth of travel was more than  all  the wasted
          CFC's of  the  entire  world  for an entire month.  And think how
          many jets are in the air daily and on a worldwide basis.

          Think how it would affect commerce  and  travel  should  this  be
          brought to the major publics' attention or steps  taken to reduce
          jet travel?

          The main  problem with such "events" is that insufficient numbers
          of people come forth in an organized way to FORCE change. Rather,
          we just grumble, talk amongst  ourselves  and  put up with it.  I
          was kind of hoping that Perot might be a major catalyst with many
          of his group actually taking action from an organized standpoint,
          but it seems that movement has been considerably  short-circuited
          by personality and a lack of cooperative-directed teamwork.

          We have  had  discussions with many other KeelyNetters as well as
          other contacts and friends who  percieve  a  degree  of  directed
          manipulation from either the government or other  -  at present -
          unidentified sources.   Many  of  us believe the purpose of these
          manipulations is to collect data which is being used to fine tune
          equations that will eventually  be  used in computer programs and
          be able to predict the behavior of large and/or  targeted  groups
          of people.  These in turn will be used for at present unknown end
          goals.  AT PRESENT, we can do little to halt these actions.

          Our best  bet  is  to  keep  on  sharing information and building
          experiments that might lead to  the  free release of free energy,
          anti-grav or health related technologies.
