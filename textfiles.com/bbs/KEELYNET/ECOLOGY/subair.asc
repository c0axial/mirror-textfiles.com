In a recent meeting with Chris Seebach from England, he mentioned a water
distillation system which used a vacuum to boil the water and provide pure
water.  It is a system being promoted by AquaTech, Mr. Seebach's group in
Europe.  This file provides information that relates to the subject.

JD>Marc,
  > An absorbtion chiller is an absorbtion cooling unit that is used to make
    cold water. The water ("chilled") is then pumped around the building to
    what amounts to radiator units to provide environmental cooling.  As in
    Air Conditioning.

JD > The chiller operates on the same principle as a kerosene or gas-powered
     refrigerator, using heat to make cold. I've studied the damn diagrams,
     and never really did understand exactly how they work, even though a
     compressor-type is nearly second nature. Someone else here is sure to
     help out with that.

Back in my younger days, I was stationed on a submarine.  The primary air
conditioning plant for the submarine was an absorbtion type machine.

Pretty simple actually, the interior of the unit was purged of any non-
condensable gases and very low vacuum was established (close to 0.00 mm of
mercury as possible). At this low vacuum water will actually boil at close to
32 degrees fahrenheit.

A fresh water system (called chill water) was used to "transport" the cold to
the ship.  The returning "hot" water ran through a heat exchanger inside the
air conditioner where heat was transferred to the water that existed in the
low pressure environment. The water boiled and the resulting steam or water
vapor or whatever was absorbed by a strong concentration of lithium bromide (a
salt).

The diluted lithium bromide concentration went to a different section of the
air conditioning, was heated by steam thus reconcentrating the lithium
bromide.  The water driven off by that second heating was condensed by a
seawater heat exchanger.  The resulting condensed fresh water was reused to
cool the chill water water.  The process is similar for refrigerators that use
a heat source, rather than a compressor.

Most use a mixture of hydrogen and ammonia, but the process is very similar to
the method I described above.  They certainly are quiet and don't inherently
require electricity.  Don't know about efficiency, though.  The air
conditioner on the submarine was rated for 200 tons of air conditioning,
whereas a refrigerator is something on the order of 1 ton.

As always the standard disclaimers apply.  Happy energy transferring.
