       Hi Jerry ! This is my very first access to KN.

       We recently met at the IANS conference on New Energy in Denver,
       but I can imagine that it would be too hard to remember all folks.
       Nevertheless we -  that  means  some fellows interesting in the free
       energy field - want to make these  things  more known in our country
       if not in Europe as before and make them go.

       Our professional backgrounds   are   different   geosciences   incl.
       atmospheric physics, mineralogy  but  also  theoretical  and nuclear
       physics and informatics, and even  psychology.  Our  interest  : F/E
       machines, anti-gravity, UFO,  'drilling  holes  into   the  orthodox
       science blindness in  general', mind/matter effects, health etc. and
       trying to get even some support out of government funds.

       We have been  visiting the conference  with  two  fellows,  ...  all
       financed privately ...  that may show you how serious  our  interest
       is.

       I want to  offer  you our cooperation, because I see your objectives
       as worth to be supported, and the  idea  of  sharing our experiences
       may guarantee that  a  technology will survive. To  speak  with  the
       words of Stan  Deyo: don't get it patented, otherwise the technology
       is lost for  mankind.  We  suppose   that  at  the  time  being  the
       suppression by the orthodox science institutions as  well  as of the
       multinational companies having  good profits of the known technology
       may still be too dangerous that single  fellows can develop a device
       and succeed in managing a business from it of their own and the rate
       of distribution and  application  with respect to more  nonpolluting
       energy generation would fail as well.

       Myself I'm geoscientist  (you  may  have got my card) working in the
       field of environmental protection/computer  application software and
       data processing ... but with much interests beside  that.  I started
       to gather informations  about  2  years ago. Meanwhile I'm member of
       DVS (German Association of Vacuum  Eenrgy),  ITS  (Col.Springs)  and
       PACE (Ottawa).  I  work in close contact with Andrew  Michrowski  on
       some projects.

       I just had some files (KEELY.TXT 04/20 til 05/05/93) of your BBS via
       Alain Beaulieu who  transfered it via CompuServe. Calls from Germany
       are rather expensive, so we will shortly  decide upon a file copy by
       diskette ... I will inform you.

       Here my first coop-offers of contributions and data requests.

       1) conc. Mess. 95 04/25/93 : if you or others are searching for high
          quality sensory equipment for static magnetic fields ... there is
          a little German company producing bio-physical devices : MERSMANN
          ... they have a product called geo-magnetometer  with  a range of
          20-150000 nano  Tesla which can even spread parts of the scale by
          a factor  of 1:100 ... We will  see  him  on  the  next  weekend.
          Possibly he  has some English written product infos  ...  let  me
          know if  you want to include it into the product folder or if you
          want to get a complete info package from him.

       2) If you are interested in T.T.Brown's  work  you  surely  know the
          sketch of   Schaffranke's  book  'Ether  Tech'   with   the   lab
          arrangement to make a metallic disk levitate by high voltages. Do
          you know  also  that  there  exists one last video scene of TTB's
          underground lab showing him and some collaborators working on and
          performing exactly this experiment?  These few minutes are really
          amazing. The source: Stan Deyo  (formerly  in  Texas),  today  in
          Perth, Australia on the video of his contribution to the NEXUS
          conference '92 in Sydney together with Bruce Cathie.  By  the way
          ...  do  you  know  of  his  work  ...  the  EARTH  ENERGY GRID ?
          Interesting for you or old stuff ? ... drop me some lines.

       3) Another offer of material: since  some  years and recently widely
          known by a one hour TV-report Mr. PLOCHER, living  in  the south-
          western part  of Germany, succeeded in developing on the basis of
          the work  of REICH a device (solid-state,  no  moving  parts)  by
          which overfertilized lakes and ponds can regain  in  a  few weeks
          their ability  of  producing  sufficient  oxygen to avoid further
          immense production of organic material.  The results of the tests
          have been proven even by orthodox agricultural and agrobiological
          institutions !

          The device consists of two PVC-tubes  (polyvinylchloride  ...  it
          may be good because of its electrostatic properties) of about
          10 centimeters in diameter and 50-60 cm in length  ...  both  are
          mounted about  1-1.5  of  its  diameter  apart but parallel. Both
          tubes have watertight caps of the same material.

          Inside Mr.PLOCHER puts a piece of very thin aluminum, forming one
          single layer at the outside of  the  inner wall ...  to stabilize
          the position of the foil he loosely fills the tube  with  sheep's
          wool ...->  plastic,  metal/crystallic  structure, organic matter
          ...  this remember is an orgone box.

          The Al-foil is conditioned in a special way, it's the secret kept
          by Mr.  PLOCHER. ... but what I  observed in the TV-report in his
          lab was:  he  uses  a  kind  of  camera  set  up to  project  the
          'information' of  concentrated  oxygen (coming from a pressurized
          bottle) while getting solved in  water  on  to  the foil ... this
          info about how water solves oxygen may be impressed  to  the AL's
          grid and kept there.  There was no diminishing of the proven


                                      Page 2




          effect observed.  The double tubes - known as PLOCHER - tubes now
          - are submerged into the water by a heavy concrete stone.

          Larger lakes  may  need  more  than a single device - I guess the
          density could be from 100 by 100  meters  to 500 by 500 for each.
          Another highly important area of application of  these  tubes are
          to submerge it into ponds of liquid manure. The results reported:
          spreading this matter to the fields as fertilizer did not lead to
          bad smelling (ammonia) and there is no need for any preprocessing
          in the sense of making the manure liquid by mechanical measures.

          Both applications  seem  to  be  highly  ecological  ...  and the
          material effort is rather low  ...  that  does of course not mean
          that man's poisoning of the environment should be  continued  ...
          but we  have  a  good chance to re-create some of the areas which
          most of us already thought to have been lost for all time.

          One member of our group has contact  to  Mr.  PLOCHER  and if you
          like we will try to disseminate that experience to the U.S.

       4) Now a  demand:  In  Denver  you  told  me of a video  showing  an
          experiment to  visualize  the  body's  chakras  by  a  tesla coil
          arrangement powered by a microwave  generator  and  captured by a
          special synchronized  camera.  I got curious of this  possibility
          ... Can  you  give  me  some  more  information  on  who did this
          experience ... the details of  the  experimental  set  up  ... is
          there a  video  copy available ? It may be very  interesting  for
          diagnostic purposes.

       Jerry ... please  excuse  if I don not succeed at any time to select
       the right words to time ... but English  is not my mother tongue ...
       sometime it may  sound  strange for your ears ... I'm  not  familiar
       with a lot of abbreviated expressions you normally use ... hope that
       this is not hindering a data and information exchange. So if you put
       some mail from  me to the board and there are some misunderstandings
       included or some funny sound ...  please  do  correct  it and let me
       know for my own skill.

       The job you did and do is great ! ... Cordially >>> Wolfram

       Vangard note....as you  can  tell,  the  primary  interest  of  this
          particular memo  is  that  of the PLOCHER tube and the mention of
          the MERMANN company for magnetic  and  electric  field  detection
          equipment.  Perhaps a .GIF can be drawn showing  the construction
          of the  tubes.   In regard to these tubes, we should note the use
          of a tube that contained pressurized  oxygen...this  is the INERT
          GAS GENERATOR  as  detailed in the book, "Einstein  Doesn't  Live
          Here Anymore"  by  Maurice  Cooke.   The primary difference being
          that oxygen is far from "inert".  So this in turns opens up other
          doors for  those  working in such  areas  as  pressurized  gases.
          Cooke claims  the  inert  gases  are sources for  what  he  calls
          "primary points".   These  primary  points  can  be used for many
          things.
