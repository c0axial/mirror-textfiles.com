                       A Non-Pesticide way to rid of Roaches

       Roaches, along with  many  other  insects,  detect  the  presence of
       danger through their antenna and very fine hairs on their body.

       As a predator approaches, the slight  air currents which precede the
       movement of the body cause the antenna to vibrate.  This movement is
       magnified through the length of the antenna to alert  the  insect of
       an approaching danger.

       Roaches are therefore   VERY  RESPONSIVE  to  the  movement  of  air
       currents and will run for cover.   They  also  seek out moisture and
       darkness.

       According to researchers  with the U.S. Department  of  Agriculture,
       this sensitivity to  drafts  offers  an  excellent  natural means of
       driving them away.

       Keep your windows open to allow breezes  to  move through your home.
       The breezes not only disturb the roach antenna, but will dry out any
       moist areas where roaches tend to lay their eggs.

       We at Vangard Sciences and KeelyNet lean toward natural pest control
       methods whenever and wherever possible.
