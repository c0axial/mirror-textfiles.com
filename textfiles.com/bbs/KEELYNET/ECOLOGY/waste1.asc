                       Microwaves for Toxic Waste Treatment

       IIT Research Institute  in Chicago has developed a process which can
       literally cook toxic waste right out of soil.  The soil is heated to
       temperatures as high as 350 degrees F.

       Tests carried out at a Madison, Wisconsin Air Force base showed that
       almost 99 percent  of  the jet fuel,  chlorinated  hydrocarbons  and
       waste oils in  30  tons  of  contaminated  soil  were   successfully
       removed.

       Tubular electrodes are  inserted  to  a depth of six feet in a waste
       containment area or laid across the top of the area.

       The soil is  heated up when the electrodes  are  excited  by  radio-
       frequency energy.  The process is similar to the  heating  within  a
       microwave oven except that this process uses much lower frequencies.

       During the cooking process, water and hazardous components contained
       in the soil  are rapidly evaporated.  These vapors are collected and
       condensed by being passed through  a bed of activated charcoal which
       is then removed from the site.

       The system is said to be able to clean up a polluted  site  for  one
       third to one half the cost of current cleanup processes.

       Vangard note...

          We understand   that  a  process  of  purifying  water  has  been
          developed in Virginia which uses  EXTREMELY  HIGH VOLTAGE pulses.
          As we  understand  it,  the  charges cause the water  to  rapidly
          polarize and  drop  any  contaminants  in the process.  You could
          call it "electro-stricture".

          We have  also  heard  that  the   water   has   health  restoring
          properties.  One of the stories about the water  had to do with a
          dog very infected with mange.

          The great  majority  of  the  dog's  hair  had fallen out and the
          animal was sickly to boot.  Bathing the dog in this water as well
          as feeding it the water caused  the  hair to grow back, the mange
          disappeared and the animal completely recovered.

          Another indication was that it might have rejuvenation abilities.
          We have  no  further  information  beyond these little tidbits at
          this time, although we understand  the  man  has  a  patent and a
          large working machine currently stored in a warehouse.   He needs
          about $30,000 ? to get the working machine released.


          It is  possible  that  the  water structure is somehow changed to
          allow a higher electrical charge  accumulation  (zeta  potential)
          through increasing the effective surface area (as in colloids).

          We will add further information to this file as it comes in.
