       OK head scratchers..scratch awhile over this....

       The Story as I got it...I offer no proof that this is true or false,
       just passing it on.

       During the late  sixties  out  in  the New Mexico Desert, Steve Baer
       (Domeworks) and another fellow named  Day  Chahroudi were working on
       all manner of weird solar stuff.

       Day had the  wild idea that if concentrated sunlight  could  produce
       lots of heat, then concentrated shade or some such arrangement would
       produce the opposite effect...cold.

       The .GIF file (COLDGEN.GIF) shows a picture of this device.

       More info:

       I have also  heard  that  this picture is of an early tracker design
       for solar panels. This may be true  BUT if it is true, then where is
       the usual collector?

       The only surfaces visible in this picture are NOT black  or  do they
       in any way  look  like  potential  solar  collectors.   Quite to the
       contrary, they look more like REFLECTIVE  surfaces!   Except for the
       small panel in the center, which is SHADED..

       Vangard Note...A coincidence that Lee uploaded this  file  about one
                      week after  one  of  our  friends  was  pondering why
                      THERMOELECTRIC CELLS would generate a "field of cold"
                      rather than a "field  of  heat" just by reversing the
                      direct current  polarities.  He suggested  that  this
                      might tap  into  the  mysterious  "cold  current"  or
                      "negative electricity"  of  the  Sweet  VTA.   We are
                      working on a test of this possibility.
