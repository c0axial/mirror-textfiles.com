                     THE MACROBIOTIC GENIUS OF WALTER RUSSELL

            "The Times  of  July 21 [1930] contains an article stating that
       Walter Russell challenges the Newtonian theory of gravitation.  This
       artist, who is admittedly not a scientist,  goes  on to say that the
       fundamentals of science are so hopelessly wrong and  so  contrary to
       nature, that nothing but a major surgical operation upon the present
       primitive beliefs can   ever   put  them  in  line  for  a  workable
       cosmogenetic synthesis'. . .

            "It seems to me it would be more  fitting  for an artist of Mr.
       Russell's acknowledged distinction in his own field,  to  remain  in
       it, and not  go  trespassing  on  'ground  which even angels fear to
       tread'.  "For nearly  three  hundred   years  no  one,  not  even  a
       scientist, has had  the  temerity  to  question  Newton's   laws  of
       gravitation.  Such an  act  on the part of a scientist would be akin
       to blasphemy, and for an artist to  commit  such an absurdity is, to
       treat it kindly,  an  evidence  of  either  misguidance   or   crass
       ignorance of the enormity of his act. . ."

            --  Dr. John E. Jackson, The New York Times, August 3, 1930.

            "Dr. John  E.  Jackson's  letter  to  you,  a  copy of which he
       graciously sent to me, is a perfectly  natural  letter of resentment
       for which I do not blame him in the least.

            "It is  true  that  I  have  challenged  the  accurateness   or
       completeness of the  Newtonian laws of gravitation, and will just as
       vigorously attack the other "sacred laws" of Kepler, and any others,
       ancient or modern, that need rewriting. . .

            "I am sorry an artist had to  do  it, but Sir Oliver Lodge said
       that no scientist could make the supreme discovery  of the one thing
       for which science  is  looking  and  hoping.   He  said  that such a
       discovery would have to be the 'supreme  inspiration  of  some poet,
       painter, philosopher or saint'. . .

            "Newton, for example, would have solved the other  half  of the
       gravitation problem if  he had found out how that apple and the tree
       upon which it grew got up in the  air  before  the  apple  fell.   I
       challenge the world  of  science to correctly and completely  answer
       that question. . ."

            --  Dr. Walter Russell, The New York Times, August 17, 1930.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

            "I now  wish to modify my statements and criticisms, for, since
       writing that letter, my viewpoint  has somewhat changed. . .  What I
       considered to be  the overnight inspiration of a 'crank'  might  be,
       instead, the result of an intelligent and prolonged study of
       Nature.

            "I am immensely intrigued by Russell's 'two-way' principle, for
       it gives this  universe  of  motion  a meaning to me that it did not
       have before.  In fact, we know very little of the why of anything. .

            "Why did not some scientist  think  of  this instead of waiting
       300 years for  an  artist  to tell us about it? . .  .I  invite  the
       collaboration and criticism of my fellow scientists at large to join
       me in this. . . If Russell is right, and he surely thinks he is, his
       claim that science   needs   'a   major   surgical   operation'   is
       justifiable. . ."

            -- Dr. John E. Jackson, The New York Times, November 9, 1930.

       -----------------------------------------------------------------

            Dr. John E. Jackson was furious.  What  educated  person  would
       have the audacity to challenge Newton and Kepler?   For  months  the
       debate raged in the New York Times' "Letters" page.  Prompted by the
       release of an  artist's  heretical  views on science, Nature and the
       universe, the Times' 1930 filibuster  culminated  in  Dr.  Jackson's
       dramatic reversal -- what began as a caustic attack  was transformed
       into a call for his colleagues' support that had the fervent ring of
       religious conversion.  Dr.  Jackson,  whoever  he  was, had caught a
       glimmer of the genius of Walter Russell.

            But in the end, Dr. Jackson notwithstanding, the world of

       science did not  embrace  Walter  Russell,  nor  have sixty years of
       progress changed that position.  Today,  despite  the wide sphere of
       contacts and influence  generated  by  Russell  and   his  wife  and
       colleague, Lao, their teachings largely await unearthing.

            However, the  time for that rediscovery may be at hand; for the
       Russells' vision suddenly has burning  relevance  to an acknowledged
       urgent matter of global health.  And the role of  advocate  for  the
       Russell perspective may   best   be   fulfilled   by  those  in  the
       macrobiotic movement -- for the macrobiotic world view and Russell's
       practical cosmology have much in common.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Cloud Over the Ozone

            Our story begins some ten miles  above  the  Earth's surface in
       the stratosphere, home  of  the  planet's  ailing   ozone  skin  and
       birthplace of the  emerging  global awareness of the limits of man's
       technology.  In 1974, two scientists at the University of California
       made an announcement that shocked  the  world.    When Drs. Sherwood
       Rowland and Mario Molina warned of possible global  ozone depletion,
       they touched off  a  controversy  that  was  to  involve scientists,
       industry, policy-makers, the press and the public.  The "Ozone War,Ó
       as it came to be called, was principally responsible for ushering in
       a new era of planetary policy.  [See sidebar.]

            Fifteen years later, the ponderous  gears of human response are
       finally grinding into  action.   Aimed at coping with  the  infamous
       "ozone hole,Ó a  spate  of local and global policy-making is pushing
       its way forward  in  an unprecedented  atmosphere  of  international
       cooperation.  Rep. Al   Gore  (D-TN),  the  seasoned   environmental
       advocate who helped   uncover   Love   Canal  and  has  stalked  the
       Greenhouse effect for years, recently  introduced legislation to ban
       production of CFCs (the chemical generally thought  responsible  for
       the ozone crisis) within 5 years.  As Gore observed this February:

            "The political  sentiment is changing very rapidly. . . I think
       people are mad about this and ready for dramatic action.

            But are  they  the  right actions?   Not  according  to  Walter
       Russell, who predicted the ozone dilemma 35 years ago  --  a full 20
       years before the  Rowland/Molina  research  made  headlines  --  and
       ascribed it to an entirely different cause.

            If Russell's views were correct, then the chlorine chemistry of
       CFCs is not the prime culprit [see  sidebar],  and no one is looking
       in the one  direction  that  matters  most.  In fact,  according  to
       Russell, there is   one  overarching  solution  to  the  atmospheric
       emergency: stop making nuclear stockpiles -- immediately.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       A Different Scenario

            The year is 1954.  Sherwood  Rowland's  ozone  prognosis is two
       decades in the future; Three Mile Island is a quarter  century still
       to come.  To  most  of  us,  the "Greenhouse effect" connotes little
       more than a  better  way  to  grow  tomatoes.   The  word  "ecology"
       scarcely exists in the mainstream lexicon.


                                      Page 3





            This is  the  year  atmospheric bomb testing has begun, both by
       the Soviet Union in Siberia and by  the  United States on the Bikini
       atoll.  John Wayne and a company of actors and movie  personnel  are
       filming a Western  in Nevada, and emerge from long days' of shooting
       covered with radioactive  fallout.    Years   later,   it   will  be
       discovered that nearly  all  of  them  have  just received  a  death
       sentence.  But all  of  that is many years away; for now, most of us
       are caught up in the promise of Eisenhower's "Atoms for Peace.

            This year, Walter and Lao Russell  write  their  warning  in  a
       privately circulated newsletter  to  their  students:   Oxygen   and
       radioactive stockpiles cannot   coexist.   Digging  up  the  Earth's
       heavier elements, concentrating their  reactions and releasing their
       products into the atmosphere is a recipe for disaster.

             Three years  later  the  Russells  publish   a   book,  Atomic
       Suicide?, whose principle  message  is  that  the development of the
       nuclear weaponry and  industry,   if   allowed   to  continue,  will
       eventually destroy the planet's oxygen.

            "The element of surprise which could delay the discovery of the
       great danger, and  thus  allow  more plutonium piles  to  come  into
       existence, is the  fact  that scientists are looking near the ground
       for fallout dangers  and other radioactive  menaces.   The  greatest
       radioactive dangers are accumulating from eight to  twelve  miles up
       [in the stratosphere].  The upper atmosphere is already charged with
       death-dealing radioactivity, for  which it not yet sent us its bill.
       It is slowly coming, however, and  we  will  have  to pay for it for
       another century, even if atomic energy plants ceased today.
       (Atomic Suicide?, page 18.)

            Later  in  the  book,  they  predict that the oxygen-destroying
       effects of radiation would not be noticed "until the late
       seventies.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Atomic Prophesies

            It was  an  uncannily  accurate  forecast:  ozone depletion was
       first noticed over the Antarctic  in  1982  --  and  scientists have
       since concluded that it first appeared in 1979.  But  then,  as now,
       the Russells' voice received little notice.

            The somber prediction of Atomic Suicide? was not the first time
       Russell had gone out on a limb with scientific prophecy.  His spiral
       charts of the  atomic  table,  copyrighted  in  1926,  predicted the
       discovery of the transuranic elements  Plutonium  and  Neptunium, as
       well as the  now-familiar  elements of "heavy water,  Deuterium  and
       Tritium -- years before they were isolated in research labs.

            Some have  claimed  that  the 1926 Russell charts (for which he
       later received an honorary doctorate  from  the  American Academy of
       Sciences) and his years of New York City lectures on the subject led
       directly to the laboratory research that resulted in these elements'
       later discovery.   It is difficult to document such  a  claim  at  a
       half century's distance,  but  this  sequence certainly is feasible.
       Russell himself evidently  exerted  considerable  energy  for  years
       urging the research  labs  of  Union Carbide, Westinghouse,  General
       Electric and others to verify his atomic findings.

                                      Page 4





            In any  case,  the  exclusion  from the mainstream of Russell's
       charts is perhaps one of the most  unfortunate snafus in the history
       of science.  For in neglecting to credit Russell with  these pivotal
       atomic discoveries, the  world  also lost track of the other side of
       the Russell equation: the larger  scientific  understanding  in  the
       spiral charts, the pragmatic warnings that accompanied them, and the
       breathtaking scope of  macrobiotic  thought  his   life   and   work
       revealed.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Who Was Walter Russell?

            Russell's stunning  achievements  in science were but one facet
       of a career  that  was  unconventional,   astonishingly  successful,
       dazzlingly versatile and  unabashedly mystical.  Often  called  "the
       20th Century's Leonardo"  and "the man who tapped the secrets of the
       universe,Ó Russell maintained   that   a   firm  grasp  of  nature's
       universal principles would permit anyone to excel  in  any  area  of
       endeavor; thus genius was all human beings' birthright.

            His own accomplishments exemplify this belief.  A largely self-
       taught Renaissance man,  Russell  carved  out  his  first successful
       career as an  artist,  achieving international  reputation  in  such
       diverse fields as  portraiture, poetry, sculpture and  architecture.
       His accomplishments as   a   portrait   painter   and  sculptor,  in
       particular, won him commissions from dozens of era notables, such as
       Mark Twain, Thomas  Watson (the founder  of  IBM),  both  Roosevelts
       (Teddy and FDR), and Thomas Edison.  He also designed  buildings and
       urban layout -- New York City's famous Hotel Pierre, for example, is
       a Russell creation.   Forays  into the world of athletics earned him
       prestigious awards in figure-skating,  horsemanship  and  race-horse
       training.

            To Russell, such bravura performance was significant mainly for
       its value as a demonstration that Divine Law and  Balance  could  be
       tapped by human  effort,  and  the  world of art was only a starting
       point. Russell's yearning to imbue the social fabric of his era with
       principles of universal justice led to his long association with the
       Twilight Club, a contemporary "think  tank"  of  artists  and social
       philosophers.

            Through the Twilight Club, whose direction he  assumed in 1895,
       Russell formed bonds that were to endure throughout his life; in the
       early decades of  the century the work of the Twilight Club members,
       under the influence  of  Russell's   teaching   of  Divine  Law  and
       Universal Order, produced a virtually endless procession  of  social
       innovations, such as  the  creation  of  child  labor laws and child
       welfare laws, Better  Business   Bureau   and   the  elimination  of
       sweatshops.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       The Living Universe

            It was in science, however, that Russell left  his  least known
       and perhaps his  greatest  legacy.  While steeped in the discoveries
       and frontiers of his own time, Russell's  science  essentially  is a
       thorough reworking of a Taoist or pre-Socratic world  conception  in
       modern terms.  Freely  blending  mystic  and  religious imagery with
       rigorous mechanical logic, Russell's scientific cosmology is rooted

                                      Page 5





       in the idea that all phenomena, from star systems to atomic systems,
       arise from the  same  infinite  source  to  live,  grow  and  die by
       precisely identical processes.

            Hence, there is no fundamental  difference  between animate and
       inanimate matter in   Russell's   universe   --   all   are   living
       manifestations of God's universe.

            "All bodies  in  all the universe are the same in all respects,
       whether they are  electrons,  cells,   rocks,  metals,  trees,  men,
       planets or suns.  All of them live and die in the same  manner.  All
       breathe in the   charging   breath  of  life  and  breathe  out  the
       discharging breath of death.  All of them compress heat and polarize
       when they breathe in, and expand,  cool  and  depolarize  when  they
       breathe out.  (Atomic Suicide?, p. 9.)

            Thus, Russell's    universal    mechanics     hinges    on    a
       reinterpretation of the  ancient  "unified field" theorem of yin and
       yang.  Life --  not  only biological  life,  but  the  existence  of
       planets, gases and  metals  as  well  --  is  caused  by  increasing
       compression; and death, by expansion.  These two processes, which he
       also terms "charging"  and  "discharging,Ó  are not seen as separate
       forces but as opposite stages and  directions  of  one process, much
       like the winding  up  and subsequent unwinding of  a  spring.   Life
       dominates every form  from  its  inception  to  the point of maximum
       compression, when the  spring   cannot   be   wound   any   tighter;
       compression then begins  to  decrease, radiation assumes  dominance,
       and the process of releasing life's charge -- of dying -- unfolds.

            To Russell,  the elements of matter are also living entities in
       various stages of birth, growth and  decay.   Carbon,  the  basis of
       organic life, is the expression of matter at maturity;  elements  of
       higher atomic weights are already dominated by the aging side of the
       pendulum's swing.  In  the  heaviest  elements,  the  force of decay
       reaches near-total dominance  over   the   force  of  life  --  thus
       radioactivity is death  incarnate.   [See sidebar,  "The  Spiral  of
       Elements.]
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       The Secret Life of Plutonium

            The key  to  grasping  Russell's understanding of radioactivity
       and ozone is the realization that  all  the  elements, like all life
       forms, are ideally  suited  to existence within their  own  natural,
       local ecology.  Thus,  all  the elements, when left in their natural
       dimension, serve beneficial  and   life-giving  purposes,  including
       Urium -- later dubbed "Plutonium.

            Put another way, each octave or dimension of matter has its own
       natural pressure zone.  [For an explanation of the  octave idea, see
       the sidebar, "The Spiral of Elements.]  The five elements of organic
       life (C, H,  N, O and Si) all need the normal pressures found at the
       Earth's surface to exist normally.   The  natural  dimension for the
       supercompressed, naturally radioactive  elements  (radium,  uranium,
       plutonium, et al.)  is  deep  underground,  where  they  are  widely
       dispersed in solid rock.  Here, far  from being deadly or poisonous,
       they actually have  made possible organic life on  Earth's  surface:
       through billions of  microscopic  explosions,  they  have  gradually
       caused the surrounding rocky crust to break down and release water

                                      Page 6





       and other lower-octave  elements  --  something  like  a  geological
       compost.

            "Water and  soil  are  decayed   and  dying  rock.   They  are,
       literally, dead rocks.   Out of death in Nature life  springs.  .  .
       Think of the  hundreds  of  millions  of years Nature has to work to
       decay solid rock and metal planets  sufficiently  to  create  enough
       decayed surface, and  an  atmosphere,  for organic  life  to  become
       possible.  The radioactive  metals  made that possible.  Radioactive
       metals are dead and dying bodies.   They  belong underground just as
       dead animal bodies  belong  underground.  They are  not  poisons  in
       their own environment.  .  .   Man  makes them poisonous by removing
       them from their purposeful environment.

            "Just as the slight decay of  an  overripe  peach will not hurt
       you, while a  fully  decayed one might kill you, so,  likewise,  the
       'overripe' chemical elements of the earth which are not too far from
       carbon [potassium, selenium,  iodine, etc.] will not hurt you, while
       the further they are beyond carbon  the more deadly they become, and
       the more impossible it is to guard yourself from their quick death.Ó
       (Atomic Suicide?)

            In short,  said  the  Russells,  the only structures  naturally
       suited to exist  together  with  the radioactive elements are rocks.
       Even concrete, durable metals, "glassified"  tombs  or  salt beds --
       structures presently considered  to  contain high-level  radioactive
       wastes -- will  eventually  decay  in  proximity to the concentrated
       pressures of such supercompost.  The  soft tissues of the fourth and
       fifth octaves, including our bodies, vegetation and  the  atmosphere
       itself, certainly cannot endure such a powerful unwinding.

            So, then,  what  would  happen?   In  Russell's estimation, the
       lighter pressures of the stratosphere  would  retain the majority of
       radioactive fallout, and would be the first region that would reveal
       the wholesale destruction of oxygen.  That's oxygen, not just ozone:
       if played through  to  the  end, the last act of the  nuclear  drama
       would see the  disappearance of all oxygen on the planet, whether as
       ozone, water or the O2 we breathe.  In this context, the ozone hole,
       as serious as it is in its own right,  emerges  as  an early warning
       sign.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Our Depleted Personal Ozone

            In addition  to  destroying ozone, Russell's logic  would  also
       seem to predict  other  early  effects, including the destruction of
       oxygen mechanisms within our bodies;  for  the body concentrates far
       more radiation within  its  tissues  than  exists   freely   in  the
       atmosphere.  Dr. Tim  Binder,  a leading spokesman for the Russells'
       work, has postulated that "radiation  may affect the oxygen-ozone in
       our white blood cells that is one of the principal  [immune  system]
       mechanisms used to destroy pathogens.

            This line  of  thinking  may  already have been confirmed.  For
       decades, a body of surprising data  on health and radiation has been
       observed by a number of researchers, notably Dr.  Alice  Stewart  in
       England and Dr.  Ernest  Sternglass  in  the US.  Their figures show
       that long-term, relatively low-level level radiation may wreak up to
       1,000 times more biological havoc than currently accepted "risk

                                      Page 7





       levels" predict.  The  mechanism responsible for this dramatic trend
       was first discovered in 1972 by a  Canadian  researcher  named Abram
       Petkau, and has  since  been confirmed by other researchers.   [This
       issue's article by  Sara  Shannon  details the Petkau effect and its
       dietary implications -- Ed.]

            The little-publicized  "Petkau   effect"   occurs  through  the
       creation of highly  reactive  oxygen  molecules  with   a  "negative
       charge" (the negative  ion  02Ð).   But according to Russell, Nature
       produces no such  thing  as a "negative  charge.Ó   All  matter,  he
       maintained, exhibits both charging and discharging  properties;  and
       all charges, whether  of  male or female polarity, are positive.  In
       Russell's terms, what Petkau observed  is  not  a  "highly  reactive
       negative ion" but  a  changed  form  of  oxygen that  is  abnormally
       balanced towards discharging  its  energy  rather  than  charging --
       unwinding rather than winding.

            Thus, what Petkau first documented in 1972 and what Rowland and
       Molina first suggested two years later may prove to be precisely the
       same symptom, only on different  scales.   Perhaps  we  are  already
       suffering from internal  "ozone  depletion;  or  put   another  way,
       perhaps the Earth's  ozone  crisis amounts to radiation burn -- Gaia
       herself is already suffering from the Petkau effect.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Rx For Disaster

            A problem  without  solutions  is  not  worth  unearthing,  and
       Russell's life was centered on practical solutions.  As an immediate
       measure, Russell recommended   that   all  nuclear   stockpiles   be
       dismantled and their  materials  dispersed  in deep desert trenches.
       His reasoning here is three-fold.   First,  the  goal ought to be to
       return these elements  to  their  natural  context   --   that   is,
       underground -- where   they  originally  were  harmless.   Secondly,
       concentrating them in massed piles  is a big mistake: they should be
       widely dispersed, as they occur in nature.  Thirdly,  remote  desert
       regions should be  selected as an added precaution, assuming that it
       will take some  time  for us to master  Russell's  atomic  mechanics
       sufficiently to repatriate the volatile materials properly  and,  if
       possible, correct the existing stratospheric damage.

            The key  to  such  proper  treatment  may lie in the intriguing
       science of atomic  transmutation,  which  holds  that  elements  can
       change into one another freely within normal conditions  (i.e.,  not
       requiring the tremendous  heat and pressures of a high-tech particle
       accelerator.)  Also like Georges Ohsawa,  Russell asserted that low-
       energy, "table-top" transmutation   of   elements    was   eminently
       possible.  Fueled by  an  early  conviction that the civilization of
       our present time would require new sources of energy, Russell
       developed an approach to derive free  hydrogen  from  the atmosphere
       through atomic transmutation.  [The recent claims of  several  teams
       of scientists to   have  achieved  "table-top"  nuclear  fusion  may
       finally have provided mainstream evidence  of this claim; as of this
       writing, not enough information has been released  to  evaluate  the
       nature of the news-making discoveries -- Ed.]

            Other energy   sources  suggested  by  Russell's  work  include
       devices using the winding-up "life principle" of nature, rather than
       the winding-down "death principle" exemplified by explosive

                                      Page 8





       technologies of combustion  and  atomic  fission.   In  other words,
       Russell maintained that  so far  we  have  employed  only  half  the
       possibilities the two-way  universe  presents.   Examples   of  such
       technologies include an  "implosion  engine" and a logarithmic solar
       amplifier.  [Forthcoming issues  of  Solstice  will  report  on  the
       present state of several of these technologies -- Ed.]

            This is a radical concept; it is not hard to see  why the great
       electrical science pioneer  Nikola Tesla once told Russell he should
       "lock up his  work in a vault in  the  Smithsonian  for  a  thousand
       years" to keep  it  for  future generations who might  be  developed
       sufficiently to understand it.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Challenge to Science

            Meanwhile, back  at  the  labs  of  established science and the
       chambers of policy-making, it is  highly  unlikely  that  anyone  is
       talking about Russell's assessment of the problem --  let  alone his
       suggestions for solving  it.   Achieving  such  a  discussion  is an
       undertaking even more ambitious than  it  would  first  appear.  For
       scientists to consider the hypothesis, they will  have  to  face its
       author.  And taking  a  hard look at Dr. Walter Russell may not be a
       pill much easier for science to swallow  in the 1990s than it was in
       the 1930s.

            This is not hard to understand.  For one thing,  in the eyes of
       most scientists Russell   always   remained  an  artist  --  a  non-
       scientist.  Moreover, his  work is  not  merely  unconventional:  it
       overturns many of the cherished tenets of science.

            But what  makes  Russell's  work  so difficult  for  mainstream
       acceptance is that  it  spurns  all  divisions  between  physics and
       metaphysics, and proposes a comprehensive,  logical  explanation for
       God and atomic physics in the same breath.  What are  scientists  to
       make of a man who writes:

            "What is  Atomic  Energy?  In answering this question let it be
       remembered that God is love, and that  this universe is founded upon
       love.  Every action and its reaction in Nature must  be  in  balance
       with each other  in  order  to carry out to the purposeful intent of
       the Creator.

            As we suggested earlier, those  involved in macrobiotics may be
       best positioned to   understand   the  scope  and  practicality   of
       Russell's views, and  thus  to  help  break ground where established
       scientists hesitate to tread.  A  pivotal  question,  then:  how has
       Russell fared in the macrobiotic world?
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Walter Russell and The Macrobiotic Movement

            Considering the  sheer scope of his vision and  his  remarkably
       practical understanding of  the  yin/yang  principle,  Russell would
       seem to cry out for macrobiotic attention.   In  fact,  many  of his
       most radical scientific   positions   have  been   echoed   by   the
       macrobiotic science of   Georges   Ohsawa  and  Michio  Kushi.   For
       example, Russell contended that matter  is  not  held together by an
       attracting force generated from the center of mass, but by

                                      Page 9





       compression generating from  the  outside  toward  the center.  This
       view, one of the Russell statements  that flies most abruptly in the
       face of accepted  scientific  tenets  (and  the  one  that  got  Dr.
       Jackson's goat in  1930),  is echoed precisely in Kushi's cosmology,
       where conventional "gravity" is discarded  in  favor  of centripetal
       "Heaven's force.

            Moreover, the  Russells' application of the yin/yang  principal
       to physical entities, human relationships and the social order seems
       extraordinarily direct and simple to grasp, and as such would seem a
       valuable complement to the macrobiotic health/dietetic tradition.

            While he  did  not proselytize any specific dietary regimen, he
       was meticulous in his own personal  habits.   (For example, while he
       maintained a prodigious work schedule, he carefully rotated projects
       so that his focus changed to a different problem or medium every two
       hours -- a  rhythm known in macrobiotic circles as corresponding  to
       the energy cycle of acupuncture meridians.)  To his strict adherence
       to natural law  he credited his legendary ability to work long hours
       with ceaseless good humor and without  fatigue  --  quintessentially
       macrobiotic ideals, which he maintained until his peaceful  passing,
       on his birthday, at the age of 92.

            The following  passages from his 1957 Atomic Suicide? shed some
       light on Russell's views on diet and health:

            "The blood is of first importance  of  all  the  elements which
       compose the body.   The  nervous system could be entirely  paralyzed
       and the body   would   still   function,  but  the  blood  has  deep
       instinctive awareness of its existence,  and the body which does not
       have a happy,  rhythmic blood condition cannot possibly  retain  its
       normalcy.

            Even the  food one eats should be 'happy.'  It should be cooked
       with love and  eaten  joyfully,   and   there  should  be  a  joyful
       realization of love  in  one's deep breathing and exaltation  during
       the process of  taking  food  into  one's  body.   The  food you eat
       becomes blood and flesh of your body,  and  the  manner in which you
       eat it, and your mental attitude while eating it, decides your blood
       count, the balance between acidity and alkalinity of  your digestive
       machinery, and your  entire  metabolism.   Your Mind is you and your
       body is the record of your thoughts  and actions.  Your body is what
       your Mind electrically extends to it for recording.

            Curiously, though,  his  work  has elicited little  recognition
       even from within  the  nominal  macrobiotic  movement.   This  is  a
       significant loss for  a community  purporting  to  be  ever  on  the
       lookout for Western  cultural  and  philosophical  roots:   for  Dr.
       Walter Russell may  well  represent the apex of what the West has to
       offer in original macrobiotic thought.

            Two notable exceptions to this  record  of  macrobiotic neglect
       have been the writings of Jerry Canty and the educational efforts of
       Dr. Tim Binder.  Canty -- a long-time student of  the  Russells  and
       himself a bit of a maverick even within the world of macrobiotics --
       has drawn heavily  on  the  Russells'  work  in  his  own books, The
       Eternal Massage, The Sounding of the Sacred Conch, and the privately
       issued Spiral, Lord of Creation.   None  of  them has really entered
       the "macrobiotic mainstream" (though The Eternal Massage enjoyed a

                                      Page 10





       fairly wide readership in the 1970s); they stand today as several of
       the lesser known  but  most challenging and adventurous books in the
       macrobiotic literature.

            Binder, a naturopathic doctor  whose  client list includes John
       Denver and other well-connected environmental advocates, has studied
       and championed the  Russell  teachings along with macrobiotics,  the
       climate crisis/soil mineralization thesis of John Hamaker, and other
       vital fields of   perspective.   Where  Canty  introduced  Russell's
       thinking to a  venturesome  circle   of   macrobiotic   students   a
       generation ago, Binder  is  now  emerging  as the Russells'  leading
       contemporary standard-bearer.

            Recently appointed  president  of  the  Russells' University of
       Science and Philosophy in Swannanoa, Virginia, Binder has undertaken
       the massive project of reintroducing  Russell's revision of science.
       Next month (June   2-4),   Binder   and  the  University   host   an
       international symposium at  Aspen, Colorado, entitled World Balance,
       aimed at exposing  the  core  of  Russell's   teaching  and  related
       perspectives both to  the  larger scientific community  and  to  the
       public at large.

            While his own interests naturally lean towards matters of human
       health and diet,  Dr.  Binder  has thrown the University's focus and
       resources full-force into documenting  and  publicizing the possible
       ozone-radiation link.  For  Binder  recognizes  the   irony  of  the
       situation: the imperative  of  the  ozone  crisis  may  provide  the
       opportunity at last for the world  to  reconsider  the  thinking  it
       rejected 60 years ago.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       In Pursuit of Evidence

            As the centerpiece of this effort, Dr. Binder is coordinating a
       thorough scientific effort    to   test,   verify    and    document
       radioactivity's role in  ozone  depletion.   Combining an exhaustive
       review of existing literature with  new  laboratory experimentation,
       the project owes its impetus in part to Binder's frustrated  efforts
       to obtain accurate data from past observations.

            Last year,   to   explore  mainstream  views  on  the  possible
       radiation-ozone connection, Binder  visited the National Oceanic and
       Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)  in  Boulder, Colorado,  where  he
       spoke with NOAA  researcher George Mount.  He was told, "Oh, yes, we
       know that radiation  destroys  ozone,   but  we  don't  consider  it
       significant.  Pressing further,  Binder  learned   of   an   earlier
       "insignificant" government finding:  "during  the  bomb tests in the
       60s [before the ban on atmospheric  testing  drove  the  detonations
       underground] they found  a  2 percent reduction in  ozone  [emphasis
       ours].Ó  Given the current alarm over a global reduction of 1.7 to 3
       percent, 2 percent would certainly seem to us to be "significant.

            Binder was told that a review of this data was in process; when
       he later tried  to  obtain  this  information  in print, he received
       reports with figures that contradicted Mount's statements.

            [Subsequently, we contacted  Sherwood  Rowland's  office at the
       University of California; Sherwood himself was out  of  the country,
       but we spoke with one of his associates about the possible

                                      Page 11





       radiation-ozone connection.  Offhand,  he  didn't  see how radiation
       would be likely  to  have  this  effect,   though   the   hypothesis
       apparently had never been suggested to him before.]

            Commenting on   his   investigations,   Binder   offered   this
       conclusion: "As the  government is now reviewing the old data on the
       60s' testing, it  sounds like they  are  reconsidering  the  nuclear
       connection to ozone destruction, but don't want to  tell  [us] about
       it yet.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Beyond Ozone: The Human Factor

            Shortly before her passing in May, 1988, we had the opportunity
       to meet Mrs.  Russell  at  her  mountaintop  home  in Virginia.  The
       moment we met she looked directly  at  us  and  said,  "I'm  so glad
       you've come.  You know, we really must do something about this ozone
       hole.  The Doctor  and  I  warned about this in 1954;  nobody  would
       listen to us then.  Now the situation is absolutely urgent.

            Oddly, despite  the  dire  nature  of  her  subject,  there was
       nothing dark or  gloomy  in her words  nor  in  her  demeanor.   Her
       measured statements emerged  in a melodious flow that  was  at  once
       precise and comfortable; they seemed uplifted by a quiet, unshakable
       faith.  We sensed  a  conviction  that  all  events  fall into their
       natural time and place, with ultimate benefit for the whole.

            Later that day, she addressed  the  assembled  group: "There is
       one central answer to all these terrible environmental problems, and
       that is a  change  in  the  nature of human relationships.   It  was
       impossible not to understand what she meant, and agree.

            Thoroughly versed  in  her  husband's  cosmology and scientific
       perspective, Lao Russell held that  technical  solutions  alone,  no
       matter how cosmologically  conceived,  would  not  bring  about  the
       changes so urgently  needed.   That  change,  she taught, would come
       about only through the transformation of human beings, that we might
       realize our awareness of the infinite  Source,  the  Law of Balance,
       and the Divine potential in ourselves and in each other.   In a 1986
       message to her  students she wrote, "Only the power of Love put into
       practice can put an end to all of  the violence.  Love will not come
       into the world until mankind understands Who and What  he  is.  When
       he does understand,  he  will know that when he destroys another, he
       is in truth destroying himself.

            The modern bull in the stratospheric  china  shop, whatever its
       identity may prove to be, is tearing holes in more  than  the  ozone
       and its underlying biological fabric.  It has already begun to clear
       away a stagnant  web  of  parochial  policies  and human priorities.
       Perhaps it will even have the force  to  open a gap in our staunchly
       entrenched view of the world and our role within it.

            The cloud over the ozone may yet reveal a silver lining.  If it
       succeeds in prompting  a  closer  look at the heretical  macrobiotic
       science of Walter  Russell,  it  may  open  a  window  to  a two-way
       universe -- a universe seen in an altogether different light.
