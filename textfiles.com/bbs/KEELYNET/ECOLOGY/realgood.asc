       The idea of  LIVING  OFF  THE  GRID intrigues the majority of us who
       research free energy   and  its  various   aspects.    These   folks
       concentrate on solar cells, batteries, DC systems running  on 12 VDC
       and various ways to heat and conserve.

       Some of the  products  need  to  be more fully exposed, so here is a
       short listing of what they offer and  the  cost.  You might consider
       it if you are planning to get "off the grid".  (Love that term!)
       Please mention that you heard of them from KeelyNet  so  we can keep
       on their mailings, this way we can continue to inform others by such
       sharing.

       A neat idea  is  the  Automatic Off disc which fits in the bottom of
       any light bulb.  It automatically  switches  the  light off after 10
       minutes just in  case  someone  walked out of a room  and  left  the
       lights on.  If you want more time, flip the swith once and the light
       will stay on  for  2  hours  before  switching  off.  The product is
       called Automatic Off and sells for $10 each.

       Another neat light control product  is  the  Nightlight.   Again,  a
       self-adhesive disc attaches to the bottom of any incandescent light.
       When you first  turn  the  switch  on,  the  light  is  on  at  100%
       intensity, over a  20  minute period, the light gradually dims to 5%
       of its maximum intensity.  It remains  at  5% until you turn off the
       light.  Called the Nightlight, sells for $10 each.

       Yet another light  control product is the Sleeplight.   It  is  very
       similar to the Nightlight except that is dims from 100% intensity to
       completely off over a 20 minute timeframe.  It sells for $10 each.

       voltage systems can  handle  basic  needs,  but in the average home,
       there are numerous appliances, tools,  motors,  and  equipment  that
       uses standard 120  Volt,  60  HZ  electricity and cannot  be  easily
       converted to operate on DC.

       Small inverters boost  up  12  VDC  power  (as  from  a car cigarett
       lighter) to "house current" levels  and,  thus are handy for running
       small appliances like color TVs, VCRs and computers  remotely  (away
       from the grid).

       How many of us are strapped to a house payment, stuck  in a position
       as corporate slaves?   Wouldn't  it be fantastic to buy a small plot
       of land out in the country, put up a few interlinked geodesic domes,
       set up some solar cell panels, some  hot  water  tubing  and  be  as
       independent as possible?

       Then convert our vehicle over to electric and grow  some  of our own
       food for partial  control  over  our sustenance.  Heck, with a small
       hill (or a created one) you could  build  an  underground  or  semi-
       underground house.  Maybe  even a tank on the hill  to  keep  filled
       with rainwater, then  a  hydro-electric  system  for  backup  to  be
       gravity fed from the tank.  Swimming, power, food and no bills!
