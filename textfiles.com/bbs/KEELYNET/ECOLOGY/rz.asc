       Traditional fishing methods rely on visual, odor  - and occasionally
       auditory cues.  The Amazing Swedish Fish Whistle relies primarily on
       auditory inducement with  the  primary  objective  to  project  it's
       variable frequency patterns directly to the fish at  your  location.
       Whether at shore,  on  boat or ice, the Amazing Swedish Fish Whistle
       will do it's job.

       Swedish Fisheries Experts have known  for years that both freshwater
       and saltwater species  are  affected  by  auditory inducement.   The
       Amazing Swedish Fish Whistle is designed to project a variable range
       of pitch and  frequency.   By varying these options, you control the
       results.  Just as  cloudy or sunny  days  require  alternating  bait
       colors, the Amazing Swedish Fish Whistle may require  a variation in
       pitch and volume.  You are in complete control at all times.
