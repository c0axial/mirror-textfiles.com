                           Resonance and Organic Farming

                           basic information taken from

                           Resonance by Richard Heinberg
                    published in 1977 by Phylron Publishing Co.
                                  Ontario, Canada

       A novel technique  for  insect control based on Resonance techniques
       was reported in the October, 1976  issue  of  Organic  Gardening and
       Farming.

       Frank Batey, a  peanut  and  soybean  farmer  from  Archer,  Florida
       normally spent hundreds  of dollars yearly for the purchase of toxic
       insecticides.  These were used to  control the semi-tropical insects
       which would otherwise ravage his crops.

       A local pest control specialist suggested he take one or two cups of
       the insect to be controlled, place them in a blender with some
       water and blend into a thin slurry.

       The resulting fluid was to then be strained, diluted  and sprayed on
       the crops.

       Batey claims the  method  was  so  successful  that after a two year
       period, he no longer has to use the  bug  juice  spray  although the
       fields still crawl with bugs.  The bugs now do little damage.

       Former U.S.D.A. entomologist,  Francis  R.  Lawson,  originated  the
       technique.

       The advantages over chemical treatments are obvious and dramatic.
       Not only is bug juice spray cheaper, it is also selective (affecting
       only the bugs  contained in the spray), non-toxic and does little to
       affect the natural balance of plants/insects/insect predators in the
       treated area.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       This technique offers much room for  experimentation especially when
       considered in comparison with Homeopathic and Radionic principles.

       The tendency of the insects to continue to infest the  crops  yet do
       little damage is  an interesting aspect.  Also the gradual lessening
       of the need to apply the bug-juice  spray  over the years as if some
       form of local pattern is placed into the soil and/or minerals.

       UKACO did similar work using a radionics process in the early 50's.

       Aerial photos were  taken of the crops to be treated which were then
       developed and placed in the UKACO  transmitter.   These transmitters
       were leased to the farmers.

       They were instructed to spin the dial only once per day to make sure
       that the radionic  pattern (of a proper insecticide)  was  broadcast
       into the photo and radionically to the area to be treated.

       They were so  good  at  it that the farmers were asked to pay $1 per
       acre ONLY IF THE TREATMENT WORKED.

       Ancient Chinese doctors skilled in  the practice of Acupuncture were
       paid ONLY as  long  as  their patients REMAINED WELL.   If  for  any
       reason the patient  got  sick,  the doctor would be required to heal
       the sickness AND PAY THE PATIENT UNTIL THE PATIENT WAS AGAIN WELL.

       What an HONORABLE  SYSTEM...could   that  we  not  become  civilized
       sufficiently to follow the principles of PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY and
       not require a law to dictate or establish a control for every action
       no matter how spurious.
