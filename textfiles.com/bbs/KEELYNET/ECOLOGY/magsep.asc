       Introduction

       Here are a few facts and speculations in reference to Flying Saucers
       and known experimental technologies.  I therefore feel I should make
       researchers more aware of the little known observations including a
       few of my  own.  I  refer  to  them as the less obvious side of this
       ground breaking technology.

       Facts and Theories

       Some researchers believe  Thomas  Townsend  Brown's  work  utilizing
       Electrogravetic Repulsion is   on   the   right   track.    It   may
       consequently, be said  his  devices  must have emitted higher levels
       negative ions versus  positive   in   which  case  the  creation  or
       congealing of substances such as nitrogen, oxygen and  ozone as well
       as other trace,  or  mix  and  match elements may be produced by the
       saucers.  These I speculate may be  friendly  to  the environment of
       our planet.

       Negative ionization also  has some medical backing  as  having  some
       beneficial effects on  the mental and physical states in relation to
       the human body. Foreseen on a large  scale these devices may even be
       utilized as sky   scrubbers,  or  artificial  atmospheric   healers,
       therefore they could  aid in healing the earths ozone layer. Kind of
       like your home ionizers on a much  grander  scale.   That is if this
       technology ever gets wide spread acknowledgment.

       In the book "Case For The UFO." by M. K. Jessup, a book that aided
       Thomas Townsend Brown in his theoretical work and  which  he  highly
       recommended reading, the  same  as  I  do.  Flying  Saucers are also
       believed to use magnetic fields and  magnetic  beams  adjoining  the
       Electrogravitation.

       If this is so, then the following on page 34 of that book may be
       relevant.
                                      Page 1





            "Speculating even  further  on this weird possibility, remember
             that oxygen  is a MAGNETIC  substance.  It  is  not,  perhaps,
             paramagnetic like iron, manganese and nickel, but nevertheless
             sufficiently magnetic  that  it  can  be  separated  from  the
             constituents of air by means of a magnetic field."

       This may be  one  way  of  getting  oxygen  and  other  magnetically
       attracted gases required for use by crew members in order to breath,
       safe purified air on board a Flying  Saucer  nearly identical to the
       planet they come from.

       Thereby making an artificial atmosphere out of earth's  or any other
       alien world. You  choose  the atmosphere by knowing the chemistry of
       gases by their  magnetic susceptibility.   Separating  or  combining
       gases through magnetic manipulation. Neat!

       Flying Saucers are often spotted around larger bodies of water. Keep
       in mind when electrodes make contact with substances  such as water,
       hydrogen can simply  be extracted and perhaps utilized in conjuction
       with oxygen to produce pure water  extract.  The  hydrogen or oxygen
       may also aid in amplifying the prime propulsion or  may be used as a
       secondary subsystem.

       Another element that  is  extractable is calcium, rather common with
       AC operated devices operated in water  evidenced  by  the coating of
       both electrodes. However, this may also occur in DC operated devices
       and should therefore  be  studied.  It is most likely  going  to  be
       attracted to the positive electrode. This element may pose a problem
       or might not depending on the amount of current used, whether or not
       it is burned off or broken up. It may render a Flying Saucer useless
       or maybe an  important  insulator. It's one of the obvious potential
       problems and therefore   should    never    be    overlooked   while
       experimenting.

       CONCLUSION

       If these idea's  are  correct  and  speculations can  be  positively
       verified in conjuction   with   work   being  done  along  with  the
       aforesaid, perhaps we can join the  real space race!  You can make a
       difference in transportation, ecology, chemistry, etc!  The time has
       come! The future is wide open!
