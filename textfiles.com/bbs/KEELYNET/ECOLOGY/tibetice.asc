              Ice Cores From Tibet Suggests Last 50 Years Warmest in
                                      10,000
                    By DONALD J. FREDERICK, National Geographic
                       For AP Special Features, May 21, 1993

          Braving frigid blasts and bouts of altitude sickness, scientists
       are  drilling  for  ancient  ice  in  some  of  the  world's most
       inhospitable places.

          The ice cores they are extracting from Greenland, Antarctica and
       the lofty Tibetan Plateau will contain records of changes in Earth's
       climate over hundreds of thousands of years. The cores also should
       help answer questions about global warming.

          Eventually, snows that fell as long as a million years ago may be
       analyzed to see what the climate was like then.

          More than 28,000 feet of ice cores from various depths and
       locations are stored in 3.3-foot-long aluminum cylinders at the
       National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver, Colo., a facility run by the
       U.S.  Geological Survey, the National Science Foundation and the
       University of Colorado.  Instrumentation at the repository gives
       visiting scientists an opportunity to examine the cores.

          "Hopefully we'll go back about 250,000 years with the cores now
       being collected in Greenland," says Joan Fitzpatrick, technical
       director of the laboratory. "Ice is the only medium that enables us
       to get such a detailed record of the climate for such long periods."

          Some experts believe that increased levels of greenhouse gases
       such as carbon dioxide are producing a dangerous global warming
       trend. Others argue that the higher temperatures occur because of
       natural climatic variations over long periods of time. The ice cores
       could help resolve the debate.

          Working at altitudes as high as 21,000 feet, a Chinese-American
       scientific team has been extracting cores from ice caps on the
       remote Tibetan Plateau.

          Evidence from some of the ice indicates that temperatures in
       Central Asia have been warmer in the past 50 years than at any other
       time since the end of the last ice age 10,000 years ago, says Lonnie

          Thompson, whose work in China has been supported by the National
       Geographic Society, sees similar trends in other parts of the world.
       Since 1963, more than 43 percent of the ice on Tanzania's Mount
       Kenya has disappeared. Glaciers are also vanishing in the Andes,
       where Thompson is taking ice cores.
