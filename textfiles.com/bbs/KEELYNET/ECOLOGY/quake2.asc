       THE G.D. NEWS IN REVIEW  #43
       Western Region News, December 1989

       A MILITARY CONTRIBUTION TO THE EARTHQUAKE PREDICTION TOOLBOX?

       Common tools used   in   earth  monitoring  include  strain  gauges,
       tiltmeters, well-level floats,    geodometers,    radon   detectors,
       electro-telluric meters, seismometers, and other instruments.   Some
       psychokinetic researchers study   abnormal  animal  behavior  and/or
       hypersensitive humans affected by earth perturbations.

       Disappointingly, except for some M5 "re-shocks" that occurred months
       earlier and a couple of not-so-significant-looking  M1  shocks  more
       closely preceding the  Loma  Prieta main-shock, no  precursors  were
       obvious to help fortell that impending disaster.

       Electrical engineers involved     in    ultra-low-frequency    (ULF)
       electromagnetic research for the military, however, stumbled onto an
       earth sensing method which may be  added  as a useful tool for deep-
       earth studies here in California.

       ULF waves have interested the military because of their  ability  to
       penetrate into the  oceans and detect movements by enemy submarines,
       and one of the ULF antennas in the  global  array just happens to be
       located in the  Santa Cruz mountains. It serendipitously  picked  up
       significant electromagnetic anomalies   preceding  the  Loma  Prieta
       earthquake.

       Antony Fraser-Smith, 9415) 723-3684,  head  of  a Sanford University
       group involved in  this  research,  indicated  at   AGU   that   the
       Corralitos ULF station  picked  up  longwave radiation that deviated
       from normal backgfound  noise in  the  days  and  hours  immediately
       preceding the 5:04 p.m. earthquake of October 17.

       Is this the first instrumented reading of a deep-earth piezoelectric
       effect that contributes  to spooking animals into abnormal  behavior
       or does it  have  something  to  do with charging air to produce the
       myterious glows sometimes reported as "earthquake lights?"

       Chi-Yu (EVE-T) reported in a February  1983  article  in NATURE that
       researchers Gokhberg, Morgonouv, Yoshino, and Timizawa  picked up 30
       minutes of electromagnetic emissions before a March 1080 quake in

                                      Page 1





       Japan.  Soviet science  reported  electromganetic  anomalies  in the
       70's, and two  days  of  radio noise  interfered  with  the  Chinese
       military and civilian radio before the 1976 Tangshan  earthquake,  a
       7.8 event which also produced earthquake light.

       The discovery of ULF radio anomalies associated with the Loma Prieta
       earthquake will very   likely   be   researched  further  to  better
       determine its possible  quake-sensing  capability  for  other  areas
       along the San Andreas fault.

       Because Frase-Smith needs another earthquake for testing, the
       Parkffield Pediction Experiment looks like the perfect laboratory.

       entitled: "A coincidence?"  This  chart  shows  low  frequency radio
                  waves detected near the  epicenter  of  the  Loma  Prieta
                  quake three hours before it began. The measurements  stop
                  where the  electricity  failed,  and begin again during a
                  period of aftershocks.   Source  of  the graph is Sanford

       Notes from sender  of article: G.D. is Geological  Division  of  the
       U.S.  Geological survey.  Contributor  of  article  places  question
       marks and underlines "psychokinetic  researchers"  and the detection
       of submarines.  [individual works for the U.S.G.S.C and did not know
       that the ULF   was  used  for  submarine  detection   and   military
       applications].

       NEWS TRACK
       December 1989 Vol 32 Number 12
       Communications of ACM [Association for Computing Machinary]

       HERE COMES THE SUN... Solar activity is at its peak from now through
       April 1990, and  scientists are worried that the atmospheric effects
       will be powerful enough to cause major computer systems to crash.

       Solar storms and radiation-spewing  sun  flares  are  electrical and
       magnetic currents that can alter the Earth's magnetic  field. Space-
       based computer systems can be damaged by such solar emissions, while
       ground-based computers are  vulnerable to such dangers as electircal
       surges that can  harm  power grids.   (Solar  surges  were  recently
       blamed for wiping  out  computer  systems  at  the   Toronto   Stock
       Exchange.) Sun-watchers say   threatening   sunspots   will   remain
       extremely energetic until early spring  before  begining  to  slowly
       taper off into 1993.
