    Ice Ages and Your Future

There have been many sages through history who have predicted some huge change
for planet Earth near or at the end of the 20th century.

I am not saying here that I believe they have predicted with accuracy the
events of the end of the century. I sincerely hope they are wrong, in fact.
But since I myself have also accurately and in great detail seen future events
pertaining to my own life, I know that it can be done, at least for an
individual. However, I am not here arguing the point of prescience.

According to geological records, there have been many ice ages here on Earth.
By lakebed and soil samples, they seem to start every 100,000 years, and last
90,000 years. The last one ended more than 10,000 years ago, which means that
we are OVERDUE for the next one.

Now, most people at this point might say "Pooh! If we are due for an ice age,
why isn't it getting colder? Well, here is  the suprise. Recent discoveries
have indicated that the onslought of an ice age occurs over a SEVERAL YEAR
PERIOD! Something gets triggered, some environmental change occurs, and the
ice age comes, geoligically speaking, almost immediately!

The data I am giving here came out of a book called "The End" by Larry Ephron,
Phd. Published by Celestial Arts, 1988. It was endorsed by Buckminster Fuller.

The writer's basic contention was that as the soil mineral content becomes
more and more depleted, plants that grow on this soil convert less and less
carbon dioxide to oxygen thus causing a higher carbon dioxide content and thus
global warming. Global warming? Then why an ice age?

It works like this.  As the equator becomes hotter and hotter water in the
oceans evaporates more and more. Convection currents are set up then between
the cooler and warmer climates, and the moist air is transferred to the poles.

Then, especially in winters, the moist air from the poles rushes down onto the
higher latitudes, and clouds over the planet. This then brings on an ice age.
What is not understood is, if the sun is blocked by these clouds, then why
does the water keep streaming north?  Possibly the moisture is cleared out of
the air by the time it hits the equatorial areas again.

How does the planet then get out of an ice age? When ice drags across the
land, it first scrapes the dirt off the surface, then hits rock, and crushes
the rock, producing silt. This silt then mineralizes the lands downstream, as
well as all land under the ice which eventually recedes as the planet warms
up.

It warms up as more and more large-leafed vegetation grows on the mineralized
soils, producing oxygen again. The large leafy plants only thrive on highly
mineralized soils, according to the author. Then, once the atmosphere is again
warm, vegetation will slowly increase over a ten-thousand year period, using
up the minerals in the soil.

First the largest-leaved plants grow, which convert the most oxygen, then as
time goes by, those that cannot thrive on the present mineral content die off
and are replaced by new, smaller-leafed plants. And so it goes.

The last plants to grow are, as in the arctic, pine trees. One contradiction
to this is that supposedly pine trees produce much more oxygen than other
trees! So I don't know if this holds true for the rest of the needled trees.

Further complicating this scene is the advent of industrialized civilization.
For instance, 200 years ago, the oxygen content of the atmosphere was 35%. It
is now 19% and continuing to fall. Four thousand years ago the oxygen content
was 38%!

    Solutions

The first solution is to curb the oxygen-hungry industry.  This will no doubt
be very unpopular in some circles.  The second solution would be to
remineralize the soils, and of course re-plant trees. LEAFY trees. And THIS
would be very unpopular with chemical companies!

So, it looks like we are doomed, unless a grass-roots effort is started to
test and verify these theories. And that is why you are reading this on a
computer network! That we can cross-communicate without having to get our
information through a special-interest controlled media might just be the
thing that saves planet Earth. Either from a political upheaval or from a
natural cataclysm.

    Rockdust

The way to remineralize soils is to mineralize it with dust of rock, similar
to the consistency of flour. The workability of this was first discovered in
Austria, where the forests were dying with a blight.

A new road was cut through the forest, and someone noticed that in the area
where the dust from the road blew over the forest, the trees recovered!

To further verify this observation, the Australians dusted some farms which
had had pest problems. No more pests, and the plants were noticeably larger.
No fertilizers were used. The farm next door continued to have the original
problem.

Friends of this writer have tried sea water as a method of soil
mineralization, and in dilute amounts this also works very well!  It was not
discovered what the long-term effects would be.  There are obviously more
educated sources of this information but I have read or seen very little of it
as it is not a very commercial endeavor so who is to push it except those who
have lots of common sense? And on this crazy, mixed-up planet, where are those
people?  Hopefully you, my friends!

I did, however see a recent TV news segment on the subject of Ice Ages and the
geologist was presenting it as if it was a totally new idea.  But as you can
see the book was first printed in 1988.
