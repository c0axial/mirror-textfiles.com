       was found.

                               Mystery of the Seiche

       People who live on the shores of  Lake  Michigan  are  more  or less
       familiar with seiches and have been led to believe  that  the seiche
       is caused by a change in air pressure.

       To persons living  elsewhere,  let  us  explain that during a seiche
       (pronounced saysh) the water levels  along  the  lake  shore  change
       rapidly and markedly.   This  past  spring,  the  water  in  Belmont
       Harbor, Chicago, rose  three feet, then dropped 9 1/2 feet, exposing
       the bottom - all within a few minutes.   In  1954 the water suddenly
       rose 10 feet in Montrose Harbor, Chicago, and drowned eight people.

       The seiche comes  without  warning;  it  generally  cannot  be  seen
       approaching.  It is  not  a  tidal wave and often is no wave at all.
       It has been likened to water sloshing  back  and  forth  in  a lake.
       Furthermore, it occurs only in a few places in the world - the Great
       Lakes, Lake Geneva,  Loch  Earn  in  Scotland and  Lake  Vattern  in
       Sweden.

       With all the glib explanation though, we want to tell you something.
       No one really  understands  what  makes  a seiche; in fact no one is
       even sure just where the name comes from.
