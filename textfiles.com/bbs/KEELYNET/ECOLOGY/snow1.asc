                                 Another Snow Job
                    from Nature Jan. 89' with Vangard comments

       No two snowflakes  are  alike.  That's a "bit of folk wisdom that is
       generally accepted even among those  few  regarded as experts in the
       subject," says Nancy Knight, a researcher at the National Center for
       Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.

       So much for  folk wisdom.  As part of a study of cirrus  clouds  for
       NASA, Knight found two crystals with IDENTICAL STRUCTURES.  During a
       research flight into  a  Wisconsin  snowstorm,  she  collected  some
       snowflakes on a glass slide coated with oil.

       MORE THAN A YEAR LATER she re-examined  the photos of the flakes and
       noted the similarity.  Not only that, the shape of  the  crystals  -
       which have thick  asymmetrical  hollow  columns  in  the center - is
       unlike anything she's observed before or found in the literature.

       She reported her  findings  in the  May  Bulletin  of  the  American
       Meteorological Society.  With the coming of colder weather, interest
       in her findings has been, well, snowballing.

       Crystals such as Knight found begin as solid hexagonal  prisms  and,
       due to the  effects  of temperature, humidity and fall rate, develop
       hollows in their  centers.   That   happens   because  growth  on  a
       crystal's face is faster on the edges than at the center.

       Past observations have  shown  that the hollows are  symmetrical  on
       both ends of  the  crystal.   The  hollows  Knight  found  are  not,
       suggesting that the crystals DID  NOT  FALL  HORIZONTALLY, as usual,
       BUT VERTICALLY.

       The old folk  wisdom  may  still  have a basis, Knight  said.   It's
       possible that at the MOLECULAR level no two snowflakes are alike.

          Vibrating waveplates   or   surfaces   take  on  geometric  forms
          dependent on   the  interferences   which   occur   between   the
          wavefronts.  These  were  discovered  and investigated  by  Ernst
          Chladni and later researched by Dr. Hans Jenny.

          A sonic  field  of  any  complexity  (determined by the number of
          frequencies involved) can be projected  into  the  air, as indeed
          happens with speakers in our stereo systems.

          In 1926, Dr. Henri Coanda discovered a wall-attachment phenomenon
          now known as the Coanda effect.  Whenever a jet flows into a body
          of stagnant fluid, it entrains some of the surrounding stagnant

                                      Page 1





          fluid and  starts  it  into  motion.   As  the  fluid is ejected,
          replenishing air moves into the  evacuated  region  to  create  a
          pressure differential.  The pressure in this region  is at a high
          vacuum (very  cold  area)  which  is  utilized as a basis for the
          machines which create "snow".

          Now, if at the formation nozzle  of  the snow machine, we were to
          project an intense sonic field having a specific  geometric form,
          all snowflakes  formed at that location would be identical, since
          they are all formed in the same controlling field.

          An interesting idea since each  snowflake  is  a crystal.  If all
          the crystals were "tuned" in such a manner, then  we would form a
          giant crystal which might have unusual and "tuneable" properties.

          Of course,  these  properties  would  be  wholly dependent on the
          geometry of  the  snowflakes.    In  the  case  of  Ms.  Knights'
          identical snowflakes, we find it of interest that  they  were not
          examined for a period in excess of one year.

          Were they the same when originally captured on the oil slide?  Is
          it not possible that one snowflake was vibrating at one frequency
          and at  high amplitude while in the presence of another snowflake
          which was  vibrating  at  a  lower   amplitude  and  a  DIFFERENT
          FREQUENCY?

          In such  a  case,  the weaker snowflake would be  "entrained"  or
          forced to vibrate at the more powerful frequency which, over
          time (one year), would cause a definite transmutation into a copy
          of the stronger sonic field.

          The natural  formation  of snowflakes then leads us to a possible
          new technique for monitoring subtle  energies,  whether acoustic,
          magnetic or electric.  Using a machine like a Coanda  driven snow
          generator, we  could  project  Radionic, homeopathic, acoustic or
          other types of complex energy forms to see the results as encoded
          in matter.

          We would then see a 2 dimensional Mandala representative of the
          3 dimensional form.  When "replayed"  it would again generate a 3
          dimensional matrix identical to the original.
