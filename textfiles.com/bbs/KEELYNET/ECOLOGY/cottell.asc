                            A Solution to Air Pollution

       "In the wake   of   the  energy-crisis  a  50-year-old  British-born
       inventor named Eric Cottell has come  up  with an ingeniously simple
       and economically practical  solution  -- one that  is  now  exciting
       industry and government officials alike.

       "In the conventional  combustion  process, fuel is combined with air
       and turned.  The result is carbon  dioxide,  water  vapor  and heavy
       oxides of nitrogen, which are a prime cause of chemical smog.

       Cottell reasoned that if water could largely replace air as a source
       of oxygen in  combustion,  this  would  avoid the large  amounts  of
       nitrogen introduced by  the  air  --  and thus eliminate much of the
       noxious nitrogen oxides.

       "To accomplish this, he turned to  a device he had patented 22 years
       ago -- an ultrasonic reactor that emulsifies heavy  liquids  and  is
       widely used today  to prepare such products as Worcestershire sauce,
       ketchup, cosmetics and paint.

       By refining the  reactor, Cottell  was  able  to  break  water  into
       particles about one fifty-thousandth of an inch in diameter and to

                                      Page 1





       disperse them evenly in oil (or gasoline) to create an emulsion
       that was 70  percent  oil  and 30 percent water.  When this emulsion
       was burned, Cottell found :

            (1) that there were far fewer waste products and
            (2) that  the  small water droplets  expand  on  heating,  then
                explode into steam, in turn shattering the  oil  into  even
                finer particles,  and  thus  increasing the surface area of
                the fuel exposed for burning.

       "Last month Cottell divided his time  between  Washington,  in talks
       with officials of the Federal Energy Office, and Detroit,  where  he
       consulted with engineers  working to meet the tight 1976 automobile-
       emission requirements.

       So far, auto  tests  have  shown that  with  an  ultrasonic  reactor
       attached to a  carburetor,  a car can get almost DOUBLE  the  normal
       miles per gallon of gasolinge -- with neglible exhausts.

       Cottell's company, Tymponic  Corp.  of  Long  Island,  N.Y., is also
       about to produce units for home oil  burners  that will be no larger
       than a flashlight and cost $100 to $150.

       "Last winter, two Long Island schools converted to Cottell's system,
       and both reduced their fuel usage by about 25%.  Adelphi  University
       reports that it  SAVED  more than 3,500 gallons of oil per week!  --
       and REDUCED soot output by 98 PERCENT."

       Vangard Note...

           This file  points  to  a possibly  useful  technique  for  those
           working with  water  dissociation  for the purpose  of  hydrogen
           fueled motors.   The  smaller  the  particle is, the less energy
           required to dissociate into consecutively  smaller  units.  This
           is probably one of the inspirational sources used by Stan Meyers
           for his "fractioning" process.

           Ultrasonic generators can be both mechanical  or  electronic  in
           nature.  Transducers  can  be  easily  purchased  with  resonant
           frequencies ranging from 20KHZ  to  40KHZ.   Of  course, that is
           simply where they are most efficient, they will  still  transmit
           other frequencies just as any speaker will.

           One of  the  greatest dangers in relation to hydrogen from water
           is the need to store accumulated  hydrogen  in  some  container,
           thus allowing  the  possibility of a "Highway Hindenburg."   Any
           method of   hybrid  method  that  would  create  hydrogen  at  a
           sufficiently rapid rate, on demand, is far to be preferred.
