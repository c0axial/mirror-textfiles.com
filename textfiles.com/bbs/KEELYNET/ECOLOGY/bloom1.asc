       Vangard Note...

            We first   heard   about  Sonic  Bloom  at  a  Global  Sciences
            Conference in Denver several  years  ago as well as through the
            excellent eco-paper, ACRES. USA.

            A loose  description of what it is and how it  came  to  be...a
            farmer noticed  that plants grew best in the morning especially
            when dew  formed  on the plants.   Also  coincident  with  high
            growth rates was the chirping of various birds as the sun rose.

            The farmer got the idea that the birdsong might  have something
            to do  with  the  growth  rate,  so  recorded various bird song
            patterns and  played  them  back  to  plants  in  a  controlled
            environment.  The  results  were  so  remarkable   that   other
            frequencies were  tried  which  led  to  ranges  of sound which
            greatly assisted  the  growth   of  plants.   The  addition  of
            fertilizer rich  moisture during this time further  accelerated
            the growth rates.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       o.k.  Recently, however there have been some new happenings in the
             field of Sonic Bloom technology.

             One is that the video we produced called : GROW WITH SOUND AND
             SPRAY has  been  lengthened  with  the addition of a 45 minute
             slide lecture by Dan Carlson added on to the 29  minute intro.

             That is necessary because the  Sonic  Bloom  technology  is so
             unusual and  different that no one who has not  actually  seen
             the results  is  likely  to  believe  it. The new video is now
             available and sells or rents with a $25 deposit which includes
             $3.00 for Priority mail (2 day delivery).

             If you keep it, it's yours.  If you send it back we deduct the
             postage plus any donation you tell us to keep.

             Dan Carlson clearly says that using this system it is possible
             to bring nut trees from seedlings to bearing  trees  in  2 - 3
             years and  he  has  already  produced the first successful nut
             harvest in Wisconsin where nuts do not usually grow.

                                      Page 1





             If we  can  produce  nuts  so quickly, the system could be the
             best thing  to reforest large  sections  of  the  planet  with
             rapidly growing trees that take a lot of carbon  dioxide  from
             the atmosphere  and  provide excellent food, easy to store and
             ship for millions of people.

             Therefore we are asking people to do an experiment to prove
             that the system works.

             Our suggestion is that a camcorder be used to video planting
             the nut trees together with  a  newborn baby. Each week or two
             there would be another minute or 2 of the trees  and  the baby
             so that  the  finished video would show the baby and the trees
             progressing together.

             When the baby is a 2 - 3 year old toddler, he'd be taking nuts
             from the tree. That would work  in any language and prove that
             we can produce nuts that fast. The experiment  will  take 2 -3
             years and requires the child and trees to be together the full
             time.

             By the end of that time, there should be enough interest in
             the system that a major reforestation project could commence.

             For more information people should borrow or buy a copy of the
             video as  words  alone  cannot  explain  such  a new system of
             agriculture. They can get it from:

       P.S. Along with the video they can ask for a sample newsletter.
