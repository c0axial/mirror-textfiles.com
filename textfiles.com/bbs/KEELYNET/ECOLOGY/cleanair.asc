       Date: 19 Feb 92 13:53:06 GMT

       Our recycle "think Green" department  put  out the following list of
       air cleaning plants:

       Aloe or Aloe Vera, Bamboo or Reed Palm, Spider Plant, Dragon Tree,
       Devil's Ivy, English Ivy, Banana Tree, Peace Lily, Bowstring Hemp,
       African Gerbera, Heart-leaf Philodendron, Janet Craig and Warnecheii
       Bracaena.  These plants  are  supposed to help reduce  formaldehyde,
       benzene and trichloroethylene.

       Subject: Plants that Clean the Air Article
       Summary: Results of NASA study and list of plants used
       Date: 29 Feb 92 18:04:04 GMT

       Most of the  following  article  is  from  the  July-August issue of
       California Garden Magazine, "House   Plants Do Clean Air" by Barbara
       S. Jones.  The  original  paper  reference  is  "Interior  Landscape
       Plants For Indoor  Air  Pollution Abatement" Final Report, Sept. 15,
       1989. NASA, J.C.  Stennis Space center, MS.

       For the past 16 years, scientists have been exploring the problem of
       "sick building syndrome."   People   experienced   skin,   eye   and
       respiratory discomfort in tightly enclosed mobile homes  and  sealed
       air-conditioned buildings. It was originally thought to be caused by
       microorganisms, but has been proved to be caused by irritating gases
       given off by  the  material used for and in the buildings. The major
       volitile gases found    were    benzene,     trichlorethylene    and
       formaldehyde.


                                      Page 1





       The major items which give off these gases are:

       BENZENE: ink, paint,  plastics, rubber, detergents, pharmaceuticals,
                dyes, etc,  (Irritates   the   skin  and  eyes,  can  cause
                headaches, nausea,  etc.,  and  can  lead   to  chromosomal
                aberrations and leukemia in humans.)

       TRICHLORRETHYLENE (TCE): dry   cleaning,   printing   inks,  paints,
                lacquers, varnishes, adhesives. (Liver carcinogen.)

       FORMALDEHYDE: all indoor environments.  WIdely  used  in  UFFI  foam
                insulation, particle board and pressed wood  products. Used
                in grocery bags, waxed paper, facial tissues, paper towels,
                fabric stiffeners,  wrinkle  resisters,  water  repellents,
                fire retardants, adhesive binders, permanent-press clothes.
                Produced by cigarette smoke, and heating and cooking fuels.
                (Irritates the mucous membranes  of  eyes, nose, throat and
                causes headaches.)

       Sixteen common house  plants which are inexpensive,  easy  to  grow,
       easily obtained and  need  low  light levels were used for the NASA-
       ALCA experiments.  (Not  all of  the  plants  were  used  for  every
       experiment.) It is proven that plants remove carbon dioxide from the
       air and release oxygen in the process.  These tests  were  conducted
       to see if common volitile gases could be removed from the air during
       this process.

       The plants were   tested   in   sealed  plexiglass  containers  with
       controlled environments using accurate  measurement devices. Sterile
       soil was tested, then plants growing in soil, then  plants  with the
       leaves removed. It  was  found  that  more  volitile  chemicals were
       removed from the air when the plants were in pots where maximum soil
       surface was exposed. (When lower leaves  that  touched the soil were
       removed, more chemicals were removed.) Evidence indicated  that  the
       SOIL MICROORGANISMS growing  with  the plants were very effective in
       utilizing the chemicals.

       The implication of the report was  that  the root-soil zone appeared
       to be the  most  effective  area  for  removal  of volitile  organic
       chemicals from the  air. All of the plants tested did remove some of
       the chemicals as well as carbon dioxide from the air.

       The plants tested were:

              _Chamaedorea selfritzii_ (bamboo palm);
              _Aglaonema modestum_ (Chinese evergreen);
              _Hedera helix_ (English ivy);
              _Fiscus benjamina_ ;
              _Gerbera jamesonii_;
              _Chrysanthemum moriflium_ (Florists' Mum);
              _Sansevieria laurentii_ (Snake Plant);
              _Spathiphyllum_  "Mauan" (Peace Lily);
              _D.marginata, D.  massangeana_ (Corn Cane);
              _Philodendron oxycardium_ (heart leaf);
              _P. domesticum_ (elephant's ear);
              _P. selloum_ (lace tree);
              _Chlorophytum elatum_ (spider plant);
              _Musa oriana_ (banana);
              _Scindapsus aureus_ (Golden pathos);
              and _Aloe vera_
                                      Page 2





       In these experiments  the  most  effective plants for the removal of
       formaldehyde were the banana, snake  plant, english ivy, bamboo palm
       and the heart leafed philodendron.

       The most effective  plants in removing Benzene were  Gerbera  daisy,
       pot mum, english ivy, and snake plant.

       The most effective plants in removing TCE were the gerbera daisy and
       english ivy.

       Remember, not all  16  were tested on all chemicals and there may be
       many other plants  not  tested  that   are  equally,  if  not  more,
       effective in removing   volitle   chemicals  from   the   air.   The
       experiments are just  the  beginning  and  many more need to be done
       before the 'world's best air cleaner" plant can be identified.

       Today its very stylish to have house plants. Slick publications show
       home interiors loaded with plants,  jewelry  and  fashions are shown
       with plants, celebrities sit with plants. Many of these  plants  are
       artificial.  Homes and businesses are loaded with artificial plants.

       Unfortunately, most of  the artficial plants increase "sick building
       syndrome" problems.  Not  only  do  the  plants  give  off  volatile
       chemicals, but they    collect    germ-carrying    dust.    Enclosed
       environments would be  healthier  and  smell  better  if  artificial
       plants were eliminated.

       Ed. note: It has been estimated that it takes one growing houseplant
                 for every 100 square feet  to  clean the air of an average
                 home.

       My notes (Kelly): I think the important points of this article are:
       The plants are  not  doing  the majority of 'air cleaning'  its  the
       microbes! A healthy  soil and large soil surface for air exchange is
       something to keep  in mind when using  plants  for  this  particular
       purpose. I've also  seen  living  plants in nurseries  carrying  'we
       clean the air'  tags  which  is obviously a rip off of the study and
       just another way to get you to buy their product. Buy what will grow
       for YOU and what you enjoy looking  at every day...Finally, its just
       ONE study about this subject, its not the bible so take it all witha
       few grains of salt...:)
