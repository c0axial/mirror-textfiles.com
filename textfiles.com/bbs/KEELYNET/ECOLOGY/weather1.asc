       ARE SOVIETS FOOLING WITH MOTHER NATURE?
       [Merry-go-round]
       Jack Anderson & Dale Van Atta

       LENNINGRAD, USSR --  The  Soviet  Union could launch a "weather war"
       against the United States and, because  of  the  whimsy  of  weather
       patterns, Americans wouldn't even know it.

       The notion sounds like fantasy, but scientists say  it  is true, The
       Soviets are not  the only ones meddling with Mother Nature. They are
       so afraid of the American's capability  to wage war with the weather
       that they quietly signed a treaty with the United States  some years
       ago that banned  hostile  manipulation  of  the weather. The trouble
       with the treaty is that it is totally unverifiable.

       For the record, no U.S. intelligence  agency  has  any evidence that
       the Soviets are engaged in even minor skirmishes using  the weather.
       The only country  that  has  ever  used  weather  as a weapon is the
       United States.

       From 1967 to 1972, the Pentagon conducted a $21.6 million rainmaking
       operation designed to make the Ho  Chi Mihh Trail slippery. Mistakes
       were made. Once,  seven  inches of rain was dumped  on  an  American
       Special Forces camp  in  two hours. It is possible that the American
       cloud seeding compounded a deluge  in  August  1971 in north Vietnam
       that resulted in flooding that killed thousands of people.

       We have reviewed a dozen secret Central Intelligence  Agency reports
       about Soviet weather  modification  research  done in the last three
       decades.  The research  is  conducted   at  the  "Hydrometerological
       Institute" in Lenningrad and is a network of more than  100  similar
       institutes. Almost all of the Soviet research has a quasi-legitimate
       agricultural use, but the CIA is well aware that the same techniques
       could be used   to   deliberately   disrupt  the  climate  of  other
       countries.

       The Soviets have always believed that bigger is better, and that is
       reflected in their  grandiose  weather  plans, including a scheme to
       melt the Arctic ice and moderate temperatures in the northern Soviet
       republics. One civilian Soviet scientist  told  the CIA that he knew
       of as many  as 300 secret weather modification experiments  done  in
       the Arctic.

       One plan, by  engineer  P.M.  Borisov,  that  was  mercifully  never
       carried out, was to pump water from the Atlantic Ocean to the Arctic
       Ocean.  Borisov believed that all  the ice in the Arctic Ocean could
       be melted within  three years, never to return again.  Part  of  his
       blueprint was to throw a dam across the Bering Strait.

       The complaints of  more  level  headed  scientists  dampened  Soviet
       enthusiasm for the Borisov scheme.

       Temporarily, the Soviets have settled  for  melting  icepacks across
       huge areas of  their  country  by  covering  them   with  one  black
       substance or another to draw the sun.

       The Soviets are  proficient  in  seeding  clouds  to meddle with the
       amount of type of precipitation, but  they aren't content to use the
       standard seeding method of dropping chemicals from  airplanes.  They
       use rockets shot from the ground.

       "The use of  aircraft  was judged to be inadequate and anti-aircraft
       artillery shells and rockets were  developed for this purpose," says
       one CIA report. "Possible danger to the local population  area  does
       not seem to  concern the Soviets greatly. They claim that the shells
       fragment completely and it is rare  to  find a piece as large as one
       gram on the ground.  The danger of the rockets is minimized  by  the
       use of parachutes and the rocket sites are established in relatively
       unpopulated areas."

       Another long-held Soviet  dream is to be able to divert their rivers
       that now flow north into the Arctic  Ocean  south  so  the water can
       irrigate Soviet argricultural  regions. The loss  of  water  in  the
       Arctic could change weather patterns the world over.
