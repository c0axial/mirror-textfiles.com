                         Strengthening Concrete with Blood

       Innobat, a small  company  in  Aiguillon,  France  has  developed  a
       process for strengthening concrete  through  the  addition  of dried
       animal blood.

       Beef blood is bought from local slaughterhouses, dried  to  a powder
       and blended with two varieties of cellulose cementing agents.

       The blood protein  molecules  react  to form crystalline shells when
       mixed with water.

       These crystalline shells coat the  bubbles suspended in the concrete
       to make it  not  only  lighter but up to 40 per cent  stronger  than
       other concretes.
