       Issue 17                      The Earth Changes Report
       February 1993           The Survival Guide for the Nineties,
                                   Gordon-Michael Scallion, Publ.

                                  SPECIAL REPORT

       Final Warning Signs for California Super-Mega Quakes 8-12 on the
       Richter scale -- Predicted to Occur NO LATER THAN MAY 9, 1993

       In December, Earth Changes Report predicted that the next two months
       would be highly  volatile  for  earth changes west of the Rockies --
       floods and storms have devastated  California  and  a  5+  quake hit
       northern California in  an  area  that  had,  up  until   now,  been
       seismically quiet. East  of  the Rockies storms racked the Northeast
       and portions of New York City went under water.  Additionally,
       significant earth changes have occurred  globally  in  December  and
       January -- a  7.5  quake  hit Japan (ECR prediction  12/92)  and  on
       December 12th the first Indian Ocean quake and subsequent tidal wave
       occurred (ECR prediction  10/92.)  In  my opinion, the final warning
       bell has been sounded for California.

                   Previously Published West Coast Warning Signs

         o  Erratic weather pattern changes and severe storm predictions --
            now on-going.
         o  First L.A. Quake Prediction -- occurred April 22, 1991.
         o  Second L.A. Quake Prediction -- occurred June 28, 1991.
         o  First Indian Ocean Quake/Tidal Wave Prediction -- occurred
            December 12, 1992.
         o  7.5 quake predicted for Japan -- occurred January 15, 1993.
         o  West Coast Migrations predicted  to  begin  --  200,000 left in
            '92.
         o  Prediction for partial land mass fracture in CA -- 44 Mile
            Fracture Occurred along ECR-predicted fracture line on June 28,
            1992.
         o  Prediction for Third L.A. Quake -- 8+ has not occurred.

       However, my prophecy states that it will happen NO  LATER   THAN MAY
       9, 1993 and may occur along with super-mega quakes.

       Time is short  --  WITHIN  4 MONTHS. Back in '83 my information was,
       "watch August 1991 to May 1993."     Later, in April '91, the date

                                      Page 1





       became more specific  --  NO  LATER  THAN MAY 9, 1993. I have sought
       guidance as to how I could best assist  at  this  late hour. Here is
       what I received:

          "If an  8.0+  (Richter  scale) quake occurs in the  Indian  Ocean
           region --  Sri  Lanka should be watched carefully -- then within
           days major earth changes shall  occur  in  Japan, Alaska, Italy,
           Martinique and the western United States and Canada."  As to the
           day and  hour  of  the "big one" [California quake], this should
           not be seen as a singular event.  While May of this year will be
           remembered as the month when  the  great  plates shifted, events
           shall occur even before this -- many [earthquakes]  exceeding  7
           on the  Richter  scale occurring roughly along a line drawn from
           Vancouver, B.C. to Eureka to San Diego. Think in terms of quakes
           lasting not seconds, but minutes!

       Now, to clarify so there may be preparation  and knowing. The super-
       mega quake shall  not  have a singular epicenter.  Rather  the  land
       itself displaces its  forces  from north to south (see illus-tration
       on right.) The current Richter scale will not be able to measure its
       magnitude. Later, it shall be computed to have been  in excess of 10
       and a new scale shall be created.

       The following areas  of  California   will  experience  inundations.
       Portions of San Diego shall go underwater as well  as  much  of  the
       Imperial Valley. Tidal  waves  shall  be created traveling south and
       southwest along the whole West Coast.   Los  Angeles  shall  be  the
       hardest hit and  initially  will be thought to be  the  location  of
       epicenter, though later found to be only a portion of same. Multiple
       quakes shall occur.  The  aqueducts  feeding many cities such as Los
       Angeles shall fail and much of California  shall  be  without power.
       Roads that cross other roads shall come down and become  impassable.
       Portions of land from San Francisco to Sacramento shall be displaced
       by hundreds of  feet in some areas.  Numerous bridges shall collapse
       throughout California causing many highways to become impassable.

       Migrations will be to Arizona, Oregon, Nevada, Utah and Idaho.  Loss
       of life shall be great. Property damage  and  business loss shall be
       measured in the  hundreds  of  billions  of  dollars,   causing  the
       national and global economy to severely decline."

       If the final warning signs occur as presented, the areas close to my
       predicted fracture zone (see ECR 6/92), THE FUTURE MAP OF THE UNITED
       STATES) -- 50 miles either side -- will be the hardest hit.

       Thousands of ECR  readers  have  written to me saying that they know
       the BIG ONE is coming, but feel  they  have  no  choice  but to stay
       because of jobs,  family,  home,  investments,  etc.   As   I   have
       repeatedly stated, each must trust his or her own intuition in this,
       as well as  in  all  matters. I can only give you the signs.  PLEASE
       PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR INTUITION, NOW,  MORE THAN EVER. We  have been
       warned on all levels (see Reading the Signs by Cynthia Keyes in this
       issue.) If you have consciously decided to stay during these changes
       for whatever reason,  maybe  you  will  be able to  help  others.  I
       believe only 1  in  3  will  choose, or be able to, leave California
       during Tribulation. Healers  in   the   thousands  will  be  needed,
       especially at the emotional-mental levels.

          Definitions:  "Mega-quakes"  when  used  in  ECR, indicate earth-
                        quakes having a magnitude  range of 7.5-8.9 [on the
                        Richter scale.]

                        "Super-mega quakes"   used   in    ECR    indicates
                        earthquakes having a magnitude higher than 9.

                        "Tribulation" means  the  time  period from 1991 to
                        1997 and it is further  defined as a time period of
                        spiritual choosing and great Earth changes.
