Supercritical Water:
.
Superweapon in the War On Toxic Wastes
by
Jim Wilson
.
Imagine a chemical so powerful it destroys every known waste, even nerve gas.
Now imagine this chemical is not only safe, but actually good for you to drink.
.
This seemingly magical elixir is no pipe dream. It not only exists, but exists
in vast quantities, within a few hundred feet of every chemical plant and toxic
waste site.
.
The superweapon in the war on toxic wastes is water, albeit in a very unusual
form. Everyone knows water can be a liquid, solid, or gas. Unless you've
studied chemistry you may be unaware water can exist in a fourth state, as what
scientists call a "supercritical" fluid.
.
Baron Charles Cagniard de la Tour, a French scientist, mixed the first batch of
supercritical water in 1821. He heated water in a pressure cooker made from a
sealed cannon barrel.
.
Today, Jurgen Steinle is conducting a similar experiment, using a steel
reaction vessel fit with an ocean-liner style port hole. As an added precaution
he has put his industrial-strength pressure cooker inside an explosion-proof
testing chamber, in the basement of his laboratory at Germany's University of
Karlsruhe.
.
Eyes glued to two oversize gages, Steinle watches as the temperature climbs to
705 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure reaches 3,200 pounds per square inch.
It was at these extreme conditions Baron de la Tour noticed the water stopped
sloshing when he rocked the cannon. Too hot to remain a liquid, the pressure
was too high to allow it to become a gas. It had become a supercritical fluid.
.
In the decades that followed supercritical water was shown to exhibit several
remarkable properties. Oil and water won't mix, oil and supercritical water
will. Salts dissolve in liquid water; they settle out of solution in
supercritical water.
.
Steinle prepares to demonstrate an even more remarkable property. Supercritical
water can cause hydrogen and carbon containing substances to "burn," without
creating smoke or other wastes.
.
"The reaction vessel is filled with a mixture is 30 percent methane and 70
percent water," Steinle explains as he turns a valve connected to a green
capped cylinder containing commercial-grade oxygen. "Now watch closely."
.
A television set mounted along side the temperature and pressure gages shows
the view through the port hole. A metal cylinder, about the size of a hockey
puck, appears at the bottom of the screen. A narrow pipe, the oxygen line,
pokes through its center.
.
The valve opens. When the oxygen reaches the chamber, a jet of smokeless flame
erupts. The methane, which most of us know as the main ingredient in the
natural gas whose blue flame heats our morning coffee, burns for several
seconds, then slowly shrinks and disappears.
.
As demonstrations of high tech wonders go, it is tame stuff.
.
It is what happens next that raises eyebrows. After cooling, a water sample is
drawn from the reaction vessel and analyzed.  Every molecule of methane has
vanished. In its place is ultra-pure water and carbon dioxide, the gas we
exhale as we breath.
.
Supercritical water's ability to perform this chemical reaction without
generating smoke or harmful residues has attracted the Pentagon's attention. It
may be the ideal way to dispose one of the Cold War's more dubious legacies,
some five million rounds of chemical weapons, including nerve gas. For the
present, the shells, some of which are badly corroded, are stored in military
warehouses. Conventional incineration leaves lethal residue.
.
To speed the development of supercritical water disposal technology the
Department of Defense and Department of Energy have funded more than a dozen
projects. Participants include General Atomics Corporation of San Diego,
California; Eco Waste Technologies of Austin, Texas; and Modell Development
Corporation of Framingham, Massachusets.
.
Executives for these companies are hopeful experience gained in disposing of
nerve gas and other high risk wastes such as old rocket fuel and PCBs will
speed the commercialization of supercritical water disposal technology.
.
If they are correct, and the technology matures as promised, wastewater
discharges from sewage plants and factories may someday be cleaner than
premium-label bottled water.
