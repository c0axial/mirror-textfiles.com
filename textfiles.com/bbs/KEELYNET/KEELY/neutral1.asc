Vanguard Notes......

The Neutral Centre to which Keely refers is one of the single most important
discoveries EVER made by man.  Understanding of the concept shows how matter
is aggregated by Nature and how it can be dissociated, transmuted or
manifested.

In our many contacts and conversations, FEW HAVE COMPREHENDED THE IMMENSITY OF
THIS CONCEPT.  Perhaps a simpler, less confusing analogy would help in
understanding it.

First, we will look at Keely's description of his Neutral Centre followed by a
basic grounding in cutting edge (VANGUARD) principles which begins with the
concept of Aether.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr. Keely illustrates his idea of "a neutral centre" in this way:

   We will imagine  that,  after  an  accumulation  of  a planet of any
   diameter - say, 20,000 miles more  or less, for the size has nothing
   to do with the problem - there should be a displacement  of  all the
   material, with the exception of a crust 5000 miles thick, leaving an
   intervening void BETWEEN  this  crust and a centre of the size of an
   ordinary billiard ball, it would  then  require  a force AS GREAT TO
   MOVE THIS SMALL CENTRAL MASS AS IT WOULD TO MOVE THE  SHELL  OF 5000
   miles thickness.

   Moreover, this small central mass would carry the load of this crust
   for ever, keeping  it  EQUI-DISTANT;  and there could be no opposing
   power, HOWEVER GREAT, that could bring them together.

   The imagination staggers in contemplating  the  immense  load  WHICH
   BEARS UPON THIS POINT OF CENTRE, WHERE WEIGHT CEASES.   This is what
   we understand by a neutral centre.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                               ***  AETHER  ***

   Aether  is not only  the finest but  also the  most dense  substance
   which Man has yet conceived.  It permeates  all of space and through
   its many divisions, creates and SUSTAINS all matter and energy.

   Aether  can be so divided as to generate lower and lower frequencies
   with resultant  aggregations  of energy,  force and matter.  Just as
   as a  prism converts  white light  (many combined  frequencies) into
   what we  perceive as  single frequencies,  so  too  can  we  use the
   phenomena  of  interference  (collisions  with  other  frequencies),
   to cause  aether and other  frequencies to be manipulated to produce
   energy, matter and various 'effects'.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      ***  HARMONY AND INTERFERENCE  ***

   A knowledge of  the  laws  of  Harmony  can be intelligently used to
   generate interferences (collisions)  in  the Aether in a positive or
   negative manner.

   Positive (constructive) interferences  add  to  and  multiply  while
   Negative (destructive) interferences   subtract   from   and  divide
   frequencies.

   This means that we have a spectrum  of  creation  generated from the
   divisions of the Aether which can be shown by the following :

             Aether
                 Magnetism
                       Electricity
                            Light
                                 Heat
                                     Sound
                                         Physical Vibration
                                                Matter

   Cascading forcefalls of   Aether   divide   to   generate   infinite
   interference patterns which form the Universe and all Creation.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                         ***  THE NEUTRAL CENTRE  ***

   The Neutral Centre  can  best be visualized as a drain through which
   Aether continually flows.

   The volume of  the  Aetheric  flows   throughout   a  structure  are
   determined by the size of the Neutral Centre opening,  exactly  like
   increasing or decreasing the size of the drain in a tank of water.

   Control of the   flow   of   Aether  through  this  drain  therefore
   determines the density and weight of a mass aggregation.

   The character, signature  or  virtual  state  pattern  of  the  mass
   aggregation determines the nature of the interferences which present
   themselves to the flow of Aether into the Neutral Centre.

   This mass nature not only determines what the elemental structure of
   a mass aggregation will be but also the properties exhibited.

   By altering the frequencies and phase relationships  of  a  mass, we
   can change the weight, density and nature of the mass by reducing or
   increasing the Neutral Centre opening to the flow of Aether.

   Aether  flow into a  mass aggregate  neutral center  can effectively
   'capture' other mass aggregations, causing them to  be caught in the
   greater flow, to create what is called 'gravity'.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                       ***  TRINITY AND SIGNATURES  ***

   A fundamental frequency  is  generated  and  sustained  by two other
   frequencies which each in turn are  generated  and  sustained by two
   other frequencies, ad infinitum..

                                Fundamental
                            2                3
                          4   5            6   7

   This pattern continues throughout the physical and energy body of an
   individualized structure and is the basis of the SACRED TETRACTYS of
   the Greeks.

                                    *
                                   * *
                                  * * *
                                 * * * *

   We can now  see how tuning to the Fundamental will  give  a  certain
   degree of "sympathy" to a mass aggregation.

   This appears to  be  the  basis  for  the trinity as manifest in all
   creation in the physical forms of PUSH, PULL AND BALANCE.

   As we tune to successively finer  frequencies  IN  ADDITION to those
   preceding, we find progressively more precise sympathetic linking to
   allow remote stimulation and control of the target aggregation.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          ***  MASS AGGREGATIONS  ***

   All masses consist  of multiple aggregations of various  size  which
   follow these patterns :

       Mass Aggregations....consist of
          Molecules .....which consist of
             Inter-Molecules...which consist of
                   Atoms.........which consist of
                       Inter-Atoms...which consist of
                           Aether......which consist of
                                Inter-Aether...which consist of
                                       Compound Inter-Aether

   Each mass aggregation  collectively possesses a Neutral Centre which
   is the synthesis of all associated  Neutral  Centres  on  successive
   levels of individualization.

   For example, the  Inter-Atomic  possesses  a Neutral  Centre, (as do
   all  individualized units  as shown above).  When  many Inter-Atomic
   units  combine, the total combined Neutral Centres of each unit will
   'collectively form' an  additional  and 'new' single  Neutral Centre
   which then becomes the Atomic in the next highest order of evolution.

   When  many Inter-Atomic  units combine  (each of  which has  its own
   Neutral Centre),  a single  Neutral  Centre  comes  into  being as a
   COLLECTIVE SYNTHESIS of all the separate units to form a new EVOLVED
   structure now known as the Atomic.

   This ADDITIVE principle  works  throughout  Creation  to  allow  the
   synthesis  (and its opposite - analysis/breakdown/division)  of  all
   preceding Neutral Centres  on quantum levels of individualization in
   the  form of Atoms joining to create Molecules which in turn join to
   form Mass Aggregations such as Rocks, Trees, Planets, etc.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keely continues by explaining HOW he managed to take advantage of the Neutral
Centre principle to develop an Engine which was intended to run on Aetheric
force....

   "In the conception of any machine here-to-fore constructed, the medium
    for INDUCING a Neutral Centre HAS NEVER BEEN FOUND.

    If it had, the difficulties of perpetual  motion  seekers would have
    ended, and this  problem  would  have  become  an  established   and
    operating fact.

    It would only  require  an  INTRODUCTORY IMPULSE of a few pounds, on
    such a device, TO CAUSE IT TO RUN FOR CENTURIES.

    In the conception of my VIBRATORY  ENGINE,  I did NOT SEEK TO ATTAIN
    PERPETUAL MOTION; but  A  CIRCUIT  IS  FORMED THAT  ACTUALLY  HAS  A
    NEUTRAL CENTRE, which  is  in  a  condition  to  be  vivified  by my
    VIBRATORY ETHER, and while under  operation,  by  said substance, is
    really A MACHINE  THAT  IS  VIRTUALLY INDEPENDENT OF  THE  MASS  (OR
    GLOBE), and it  is  the  wonderful velocity of the vibratory circuit
    which makes it so.

    Still, with all its perfection,  it  requires  to  be  fed  with the
    VIBRATORY ETHER to make it AN INDEPENDENT MOTOR....."

Keely continues....

   "The man who can, even in a simple way, appreciate this vast problem
    has been endowed by the Creator with one of the greatest gifts which
    He can bestow upon a mortal.

    It is well  known  that  ALL  STRUCTURES  REQUIRE  A  FOUNDATION  IN
    STRENGTH according to the weight of the mass they have to carry,

    but the foundations of the Universe REST ON A VACUOUS POINT FAR MORE
    MINUTE THAN A MOLECULE;

    in fact, to  express this truth properly, ON AN INTER-ETHERIC POINT,
    which requires an infinite mind to understand.

    To look down into the depths of an  etheric  centre is precisely the
    same as it would be to search into the broad space of heaven's ether
    to find the  end;  WITH THIS DIFFERENCE, that ONE  IS  THE  POSITIVE
    FIELD, while the other IS THE NEGATIVE FIELD....."

Keely continues....

   "In seeking to solve the great problems which have baffled me, from
    time to time, in my progressive researches, I have often been struck
    by the fact  that  I have, to all seeming, ACCIDENTALLY TRIPPED over
    their solution.

    The mind of man is not infinite, and  it  requires an infinite brain
    TO EVOLVE INFINITE POSITIONS.

    My highest power  of  concentration  failed  to attain  the  results
    which, at last, seeming accident revealed."

    In comparing the  TENUITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE with that of the ETHERIC
    FLOWS, obtained by Mr. Keely from  his  inventions  for DISSOCIATING
    THE MOLECULES OF AIR BY VIBRATION, he says,

                "It is as platina (platinum) to hydrogen gas."
                                in other words
             "Air is to Aether what Platinum is to Hydrogen gas."

    Molecular separation of air brings us to the first subdivision only;
    inter-molecular, to the second; atomic, to the third;  inter-atomic,
    to the fourth;  etheric,  to  the  fifth;  and inter-etheric, to the
    sixth subdivision, or positive association with LUMINIFEROUS ETHER.

    In my introductory  argument  I have  contended  that  THIS  IS  THE
    VIBRATORY ENVELOPE OF ALL ATOMS.

    In my definition  of  atom  I  do not confine myself  to  the  sixth
    subdivision, where this luminiferous ether is developed IN ITS CRUDE
    FORM, as far as my researches prove.

    I think this  idea  will  be pronounced by physicists of the present
    day, a wild freak of the imagination.

    Possibly, in time, a light may fall upon this theory that will bring
    its simplicity forward to scientific  research.   At  present  I can
    only compare it to some planet in dark space, where the light of the
    sun of science has not yet reached it...

    I assume that sound, like odour, is a real substance  of unknown and
    wonderful tenuity, emanating  from  a body where it has been induced
    by percussion, and throwing out  absolute  corpuscles  of  matter  -
    inter-atomic particles - with a VELOCITY OF 1120 FEET PER SECOND, IN
    VACUO 20,000 (feet per second).

    The substance which is thus disseminated is a part and parcel of the
    mass agitated, and IF KEPT UNDER THIS AGITATION CONTINUOUSLY  WOULD,
    in the course of a certain cycle of time, become thoroughly absorbed
    by the atmosphere; or, more truly, would pass through the atmosphere
    to an ELEVATED  POINT  OF  TENUITY CORRESPONDING TO THE CONDITION OF
    SUBDIVISION (i.e., molecular,  atomic,   etc...)  that  governs  its
    liberation from its parent body.

    The sounds that  vibratory  forks,  SET  SO  AS TO  PRODUCE  ETHERIC
    CHORDS, while disseminating   their  compound  tones  permeate  most
    thoroughly ALL SUBSTANCES that come  under the range of their atomic
    bombardment.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vanguard Note...

    The above  reference opens a most interesting "new" discovery in
    regard to Keely's work which we have never realized.

    It indicates that any mass can  be  caused  to vibrate at chords
    which directly correlate and sympathize with the  Ether, atomic,
    molecular, etc... level.

    This means  there  are  SPECIFIC  CHORDS  WHICH  ARE  ATTUNED TO
    DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SUBDIVISIONS  OF INDIVIDUALIZATION and which
    can be achieved throughout the spectrum (sonic included).

    This is quite fascinating and points to an understanding of a quite
    different order.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keely contines...

    The clapping of a bell in vacuo liberates these atoms  with the same
    velocity and volume  as  one in the open air; and were the agitation
    of the bell kept up continously  for  a  few  million  centuries, it
    would thoroughly return to its primitive element.

    If the chamber  were  hermetically  sealed, and strong  enough,  the
    vacuous volume surrounding  the  bell would be brought to a pressure
    of many thousands  of pounds to the  square  inch,  by  the  tenuous
    substance evolved.

    In my estimation, SOUND TRULY DEFINED IS THE DISTURBANCE  OF  ATOMIC
    EQUILIBRIUM, RUPTURING ACTUAL  ATOMIC  CORPUSCLES; AND THE SUBSTANCE
    THUS LIBERATED MUST CERTAINLY BE A CERTAIN ORDER OF ETHERIC FLOW.

    Under these conditions is it unreasonable  to  suppose that, if this
    flow were kept up, and the body thus robbed of its element, it would
    in time disappear entirely?

    ALL BODIES ARE  FORMED  PRIMITIVELY  FROM THIS HIGH  TENUOUS  ETHER,
    animal, vegetable and  mineral,  and  THEY ONLY RETURN TO THEIR HIGH
    GASEOUS CONDITION when  BROUGHT   UNDER   A  STATE  OF  DIFFERENTIAL
    EQUILIBRIUM.
