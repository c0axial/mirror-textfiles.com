       The following file is most intriguing and applies to one of the root
       studies of Vangard  Sciences  and  KeelyNet.   Keely  used  compound
       vibrations and we believe at various  phasing  differentials.   This
       phase adjustment is known in modern terms as interference  or  phase
       conjugation and can    be    either   constructive   (additive)   or
       destructive.  Use of such principles  can  lead  to phenomena beyond
       simple cancellation of a signal, but we will stay within the context
       of the article as given.

                           Silence is gold for companies
                         Experiments seek noise reduction
                                 by Rebecca Smith

       San Jose, Calif. - Imagine summer without the earsplitting  roar  of
       power lawn mowers,  flying  without  hearing  the whining din of jet
       engines, running the dishwasher without  having  to  shout  over the
       noise.

       Companies that make  noisy  products  are  looking at  an  ingenious
       breakthrough technology that  enables  them  to  dramatically reduce
       unwanted sounds.

       "Active noise reduction" systems represent  the  broadest assault on
       noise pollution since invention of the muffler.  Products  employing
       the technology will begin showing up in mass consumer products later
       this year.

       In what could  be a boost for U.S. competitiveness, about 75 patents
       covering product-specific applications   of   the   technology   are
       controlled by two U.S. companies.

       "It'll be part of the next wave of luxury home appliances and cars,"
       says technology analyst Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research in
       San Jose.  "Right now, it's expensive, but the cost should come down
       fairly fast as volumes build."

       The idea of active noise reduction dates back to a 1936 patent for a
       "process of silencing  sound oscillations" by German  inventor  Paul
       Lueg.  But commercial execution required invention of the microchip.
       The concept is simple.  Fight fire with fire.

       Here's how it works :

          Start with  an  irritating noise, say, that of an air compressor.
          A microphone samples the noise  and sends a signal to a microchip
          analog-to-digital converter,  which translates  the  sound  waves
          into computer  language.  It creates a digitized blueprint of the
          sound, then passes the blueprint  to  a digital signal processing
          chip that analyzes the sound's magnitude and frequency.

          The digital sound processor (DSP) then computes  WHAT  pattern of
          sound waves  would  be  EQUAL but OPPOSITE - a MIRROR IMAGE. (180
          degree shifted for perfect cancellation...Vangard)

       That sound profile (signature) is then converted back from a digital
       to an analog representation.  An audible  sound  wave is created and
       amplified through speakers  or  a  headset.   When the  yin-and-yang
       sound patterns collide  -  the  whole  process takes a fraction of a
       second - they  largely  cancel  each   other   out.   The  loud  air
       compressor noise becomes a quiet hum.  Advanced systems continuously
       sample the ambient noise level, correcting and re-correcting.   They
       follow noises as they change, such as engines accelerating.

       "Most of these  systems  are  still in the experimental stage," says
       Mike Collins, a manager of digital  signal  operations  at  Motorola
       Corp. in Austin.   "In  a couple of years, it has the  potential  to
       become a commonplace   consumer   item   that   will   make  quieter
       dishwashers, quieter airplanes and so forth."

       Most of the patents required to make  a  DSP-based  noise  reduction
       system work are owned by two small U.S. companies :  privately  held
       Active Noise and  Vibration  Technology in Phoenix and publicly held
       Nose Cancellation Technologies in  Stamford, Conn.  They are working
       with Motorola and Analog Devices of Norwood, Mass.  to  develop  the
       best chips.  Other  companies  are expected to become active players
       in coming years, at least at the chip-production level.

       Active Noise says it will have headsets  on  the  market  this  year
       carrying a price  tag of about $250.  They'll be marketed  primarily
       to workers in  noisy  industrial  settings,  where they will replace
       earplugs as safety equipment.

       Unlike earplugs, which block sounds  indiscriminately,  the headsets
       will be programmed to target low-frequency, repetitive  sounds  that
       bother most people.   A jackhammer operator, at least theoretically,
       will be able to operate his or her machine and still converse with a
       co-worker without shouting.   As   brilliant   as   noise  reduction
       technology sounds, not everybody is getting on board yet.

       "The more mainstream  approach  is  to try to reduce  noise  at  the
       source," says engineer  Tom  Mitchell,  head of the Noise Technology
       Center at General Motors Corp's Power  Train  Division  in  Pontiac,
       Mich.  "Anything you add to a vehicle to susceptible to failure, and
       there's some added cost associated with a noise reduction system."

       Mr. Mitchell says GM has devoted considerable resources  to reducing
       unwanted vibrations and  noise  in automobiles.  Fluid-filled engine
       mounts, developed eight years ago, are an example of a simple device
       that eliminates noise by reducing  the  transfer  of vibrations from
       the engine to the frame of the car.

       "I could bore  you  for  hours  with all the stuff we've developed,"
       says Mr. Mitchell.  "Like double-wall,  insulated  exhause pipes and
       sound absorbers in  the  headliner.  We devote a lot  of  energy  to
       reducing noise, because  customers  tell  us  it's  one  of the best
       mechanisms they have for assessing  quality." Reducing noise can get
       kind of tricky.   Nobody  wants  road noise, thus tire  makers  have
       sound standards to meet.

       "On the other  hand,  nobody wants absolute silence.  They want some
       feedback that the engine is there.  That's where an electric car can
       be eerie," Mr. Mitchell says.

       The key to the noise-cancellation  feature  of  DSP systems rests in
       the software that's  built  into  the  chips.   That's   where  most
       research and development  energies are being expended.  The chip has
       to be told which sounds to attack and which to leave alone.

       "You don't want to cancel the sound of a great Porsche engine," says
       Tom Hesse, founder and chief executive  officer  of  Active Noise in
       Phoenix. In some cases, noise suppression systems actually  do  more
       than eliminate an  irritation  or a safety hazard.  They can improve
       performance.  Systems are being  developed  to  replace  the  entire
       exhaust system and muffler, thus eliminating the back  pressure that
       the muffler creates.

       "As a result, you get up to a 5 percent improvement in gas mileage,"
       says John McCoy, president of Noise Cancellation Technologies.

       Many companies -  including  Boeing Co., Mercedes Benz and Whirlpool
       Corp. - confirm they are looking  at  noise  reduction  systems  but
       don't want to comment on their research progress because  they don't
       want to tip   off   their   competitors  about  the  timing  of  the
       introduction of improved devices.   "I  know  there's  a lot of work
       going on here,  but it's highly proprietary," says Boeing  spokesman
       Tom Cole.

       Meanwhile, designers at Noise Cancellation and Active Noise are busy
       drumming up interest.   So  far,  most of their income has come from
       licensing big companies to develope  their  own systems for specific
       products.  When they  come to market, there may be some  interesting
       twists.

       "We could use  it  to  do  more  than reduce noise.  It could create
       sounds," says Active Noise's Mr. Hesse.   "We  probably could make a
       Honda Civic sound like a Ferrari."

       Better yet, how about one that can tune out, "Are we there yet?"
