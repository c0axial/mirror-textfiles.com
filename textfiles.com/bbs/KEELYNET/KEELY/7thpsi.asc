        During the mid to late 1800's, John Worrell Keely carried out major
    research in the  field of  Vibration and how it could be used to affect
    matter and mind.   He referred  to his  work as  Sympathetic  Vibratory
    Physics.  SVP entailed the use of exceptionally  pure  resonances which
    were  established between his  devices and various experimental masses.
    These resonances or "orders of vibration"  could  be so projected as to
    inducea variety of effects in the experimental test mass.  From various
    accounts, including Keelys'  own  writings,  it  appears that Mr. Keely
    discovered practical techniques for  the  disruption or dissociation of
    the water molecule, mineral disintegration through the  use of compound
    vibration and a means of inducing practical levitation.

         The majority of Keelys' work in the field of Sympathetic Vibratory
    Physics relied on his discovery of two basic properties inherent in all
    mass aggregations.

         The most important of these two properties is the realization that
    all flows of  force  are  composed  of  triple currents.   These triple
    currents have specific phase relationships which can be so manipulated
    as to generate unusual effects in  mind  and  mass.  Each  current  can
    result in a   "mode"   of   action  which  will  govern   the   overall
    manifestation of a mass. These modes can be defined as:

         1) Harmonic   - Tractor  - the centripetal, condensing vector
         2) Enharmonic - Pressor  - the centrifugal, expansive vector
         3) Dominant   - Dominant - the transmutative stablizing vector

         Although Keely used tuning forks and vibrating bars, he spoke of
    the eventual use of Mind-Force to establish practical control of the
    triple flows of force which are present in all matter. In the latter
    stages of Keelys' research, he believed that a human brain could be so
    "equated" as to form a perfect concordance among these "triple flows."
    If this effect could be induced and maintained in an organism or mass,
    there would be no dissociation or aging, nor would the mass or body be
    affected by other disturbances.

         The "triple flows" could be thought of as combining to comprise
    100% of the flow of force in matter. In a perfectly equated mass, the
    relationship of one current to another in terms of amplitude would be
    33-1/3, 33-1/3 and 33-1/3. This triune balance would be exceptionally
    difficult to establish and maintain due to the tendency of a mass to
    either condense or expand, when exposed to outside influences in the
    form of temperature changes and other vibrational stimuli.  The mode of
    force which rules the mass in any given instant also has the greatest
    percentage of the flow.

         For instance, a mass exhibiting the "tractor" or condensing vector
    would have a relationship of 50%, to 20% for the "pressor" and 30% for
    the "dominant". This would equate to the full 100% of the mass flow. On
    the other hand,  if  the  "pressor"  relationship  were  50%  while the
    "tractor" was 20% and the "dominant" was 30%, the mass would push away
    from the body of greatest mass.

         By judicious and precise control of the flow of the triune forces
    through a mass, the weight can be increased, decreased to the point of
    levitation or the mass component can be transmuted to another form.

         The second major discovery by Keely was the concept of the Neutral
    Centre.  Keely found  that  the  entire   spectrum   was  generated  as
    "cascading forcefalls" of energy from the primary source  of  all  mass
    and energy, the  Aether.  A point of lowest density was manifested form
    the interaction of compound vibrations which acted as a "drain" for the
    Aetheric flow.  This point is the Neutral  Centre.   It  corresponds to
    the center of mass in modern day physics.

         The Neutral  Centre exists in all mass aggregations  ranging  from
    the Prionic to the Molecular. Indeed, Keely had derived a system which
    determined a total of 7 possible states or divisions of matter.  These
    were the :

                   Keely Terms                   Modern Terms

                   Molecular                     Molecular
                   Inter-Molecular               None
                   Atomic                        Atomic
                   Inter-Atomic                  Quark
                   Etheric                       Prion
                   Inter-Etheric                 None
                   Compound Inter-Etheric        None

    All mass aggregations  are  composed  of  all  the  preceding levels of
    matter which in turn blend to form compound  Neutral Centres which rule
    the character of a mass.

         One of  Keelys' primary discoveries wa a technique  which  allowed
    the experimenter to establish an "artificial Neutral Centre". Once this
    was accomplished and   maintained,  the  mass  could  be  subjected  to
    compound vibrations or "orders of vibrations" which would either infuse
    of remove energy from the mass on multiple  levels.  The controlling of
    the energy in the mass aggregation would determine its' reaction to any
    surrounding masses.

         The work of John Keely touches on many aspects of modern science
    which are relatively recent discoveries.   We find that Keely had to
    generate many words and terminologies descriptive of the effects he was
    witnessing or generating.

         As time progresses and Man learns to duplicate some of the results
    which Keely could produce, we will find that Quantum Mechanics, Phase
    Conjugation, FM and AM Modulation, resonance and a host of other
    "modern" discoveries were pioneered by John Keely in the late 1800's.

         Modern techniques and equipment could easily reproduce the Keely
    phenomena under reliable controlled conditions.  This could yield many
    advances still spoken of only in science fiction terms.  Among these we
    could list, Free   Energy   devices,  Levitation,  Age  Retardation,  a
    multitude of Health and Recreational Applications, the increase and
    decrease of a mass weight and other discoveries which we can not now
    foresee.

         The time for the integration of the Keely work with modern
    scientific techniques is at hand. We must all blend our knowledge for
    the mutual good of our fellow man.
