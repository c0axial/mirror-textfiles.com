                              The Death of John Keely

       With the death  of  John W. Keely, one of the most curious delusions
       of the nineteenth century passes away.   Over thirty years ago Keely
       announced that he  had  discovered  a  mysterious power  of  immense
       capabilities of industrial  application, and ever since that time he
       has been more or less in the public eye.

       For a generation scientific men  have  laughed  at  the  news of the
       wonders of Keely's discoveries, but Keely died before  he  had  ever
       given a satisfactory   demonstration   that   his   ideas  could  be
       successfully adapted to commercial use.  (??? B.S)

       One part of  Keely's  invention  was   certainly   practicable.   He
       understood thoroughly the  art of getting money upon  schemes  which
       would have turned  the  head  of that early adventurer, John Law, in
       his Mississippi Schemes.

       The capitalization of the Keely Company  was  $5,000,000, and so far
       as his counsel  knows,  no  statement has been left  by  Keely  that
       discloses the secret  of  his  motor,  and  the  only  legacy of the
       corporation may be the mechanical  apparatus  in the Keely workshop,
       minus the secret by which it might be operated.

       In some respects Mr. Keely was a remarkable man.  He  was  an expert
       in the theory   and   art   of   MUSIC,  and  he  was  not  only  an
       instrumentalist, but a composer as  well,  and was, by reason of his
       attainments in this line, enabled to find the primary element of his
       alleged discovery.

       This was supposed to be a relation or affinity between the forces of
       nature and harmonic  forces.   He said he discovered  a  sympathetic
       vibration CONNECTING THE  WAVES OF SOUND WITH THE DISTURBANCE IN THE
       MOLECULES OF MATTER, and also found  in the process of this peculiar
       disturbance an energy unkown to the sphere of dynamics.

       His first experiments  were made with drops of water  in  a  vacuum.
       The first mechanical  property  he  developed  from  this  series of
       experiments was the force of ADHESIVE  ATTRACTION, which he assumed,
       in his own statements, to be RELATED TO THE POLAR  CURRENTS  OF  THE
       EARTH.

                                      Page 1





       Next he alleged  that  he  had  developed  the  FORCE OF PROPULSION,
       revealing a POSITIVE as well as a NEGATIVE energy.

       Just as the chemical separation of  the  molecules  of water produce
       electro-magnetism, he adopted the theory that he could  DISINTEGRATE
       MOLECULES by the  SYMPATHETIC  VIBRATION OF TONES producing a subtle
       and HIGHER FORCE CORRELATED WITH MAGNETISM.

       He made startling  propositions relative  to  the  rotation  of  the
       planets, etc., and many other equally wild and chimeric ideas.

       About twelve years (1886) ago he abandoned his experiments  upon the
       molecules of water  as  the  basis  of  his  texts  and directed his
       attention to the molecules of the  air.   He  stated  that  he could
       produce a dynamic  energy  of  10,000  pounds  to   the  inch  in  a
       Torricellian vacuum.

       He gave some experiments at the Sandy Hook Proving Grounds, in 1888,
       in the presence  of  a  number of skeptics.  Keely declared he could
       exhaust the air from a tube, getting  a  vacuum very nearly perfect,
       and could thus generate a force that could fire a gun  or  move tons
       of matter.

       Whatever the substance  was that Keely carried in his steel tube, it
       was apparently INEXHAUSTIBLE, which  MILITATED AGAINST THE IDEA THAT
       HE USED COMPRESSED AIR.  (how do we downplay this, they ask???)

       Keely devised an enormous number of mechanisms to aid  in convincing
       skeptics that this   mysterious   atomic  energy  could  be  put  to
       practical use.  He died without effecting  this purpose, and whether
       the mass of the manuscript which he left will be  of  any  value  or
       not, remains to be seen.

       Keely surrounded himself  with  a  halo  of mystery and worked for a
       long time in the most absolute secrecy,  making  extravagant  claims
       and promises as  to  the  miracles which he would perform  with  his
       mechanism, the "inter-etheric liberator."

       Here is a  specimen of one of the bulletins which regularly emanated
       from the laboratory.  In 1875 he proposed,  in  about six months, to
       run a train  of thirty cars from Philadelphia to New  York,  at  the
       rate of a mile a minute, with ONE SMALL ENGINE.  He said:

            "I will draw the power all out of as much water as you
             can hold in the palm of your hand.  A bucket of water
             contains enough of this vapor to produce a power sufficient
             to move the world out of its course.  An ordinary steamship
             can be run so fast with it that it would be split in two."

       Keely used to  give astonishing exhibitions at his laboratory, which
       mystified everyone.  The wand of the  prestidigitator  and the slate
       of the medium  were  exchaned in his person for a couple  of  tuning
       forks and a  violin bow.  He struck his tuning forks and set a brass
       ball running at 600 revolutions a minute.

       He would rasp a violin bow over  a  tuning  fork  and  the apparatus
       would RAISE A  HEAVY  WEIGHT, the power exercised,  he  said,  being
       equal to a pressure of 25,000 pounds to the square inch.

       Some of those  present  at  the  seances,  which  occurred  in 1885,
       thought they had witnessed miracles,  others concluded that they had
       been humbugged.  Some  of the stockholders were not  satisfied  that
       they had not  been  duped,  and  very  naturally,  they  wanted  the
       mysteries explained.

       Legal proceedings were instituted,  and  on November 17, 1888, Keely
       was committed to jail for contempt of court in refusing  to  obey an
       order to explain  the  workings  of  his  machine  to a committee of
       experts. (assuming they could even comprehend it...)

       He did not, however, remain in jail  very long.  To the very last he
       never failed to  get financial support, which enabled  him  to  live
       very comfortably and pay for all his experiments.

       The SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN  regularly  took  up the claims of Keely and
       exposed the fallacy of the principle upon which they were based.

       Vangard notes...

            In the  light of modern scientific  discoveries,  the  work  of
            Keely is shown to have been far ahead of even our time.  A pity
            that magazines   wrote  such  negative  and  obviously   biased
            articles without investigating in depth.

            Many of  the  scientists who visited Keely, including Hertz and
            Tyndall, declared that Keely  had  discovered  a  force  beyond
            their ability to comprehend, let alone duplicate.
