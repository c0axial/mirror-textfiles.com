                                Color Theory Basics

       Color theory explains  what  color  is, how the human eye sees color
       and the methods used to create all the colors in the color spectrum.

       To begin learning about color, we  must  start  with light.  We must
       have light to  see  things.   Light  shines  on  an  object  and  is
       reflected back to  our  eyes, allowing us to see the objects as they
       are.  Objects ONLY REFLECT THE COLORS THEY ARE MADE UP OF, and it is
       these colors that are received by the eye.

       When we refer to light, we mean white light.  White light is made up
       of EQUAL AMOUNTS of RED, GREEN and  BLUE light.  If we were to shine
       three PURE beams of red, green and blue light together  and slightly
       overlap them, we  can see that where the three overlap, the color is
       white.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       PRIMARY COLORS

       RED, GREEN and BLUE are referred to  as the PRIMARY COLORS of light.
       Because we ADD them together to create color, we call  them ADDITIVE
       COLORS.

       Where two of the beams overlap, we actually create a third different
       color.

       Where we overlap  the BLUE and GREEN, we create a new color known as
       CYAN.  CYAN is a combination of blue light and green light.

       Where BLUE and RED overlap, we get  a color called MAGENTA.  MAGENTA
       is a combination of blue and red light.

       Where the RED and GREEN beams overlap, we create YELLOW!   Remember,
       these are pure  beams  of  colored  light.   YELLOW  is  created  by
       combining equal amounts of red and green light.

       CYAN, MAGENTA and YELLOW are called  the SUBTRACTIVE COLORS, because
       we create color by using them to SUBTRACT COLOR from WHITE LIGHT.

       To help us keep these colors in proper perspective  with each other,
       we shall refer to the color triangle below.  The colors at the

                                      Page 1





       POINTS of the triangle are the three additive colors, RED, GREEN and
       BLUE.

       The three colors  along  along  the  SIDE  of  the  triangle are the
       SUBTRACTIVE COLORS, MAGENTA,  YELLOW,  and  CYAN.   The  subtractive
       colors are placed between the two additives that  they  are  made up
       of.  For example,  the  magenta  is between the red and blue because
       red and blue make magenta.

                                        RED

                                       *   *
           (R + B = M)    MAGENTA<<<<@       @>>>>YELLOW   (R + G = Y)
                                   *           *
                                 *               *
                       BLUE<<<<@ * * * * @ * * * * @>>>>GREEN
                                        CYAN
                                    (B + G = C)

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Up until now, we have been combining  two  primary colors at a time.
       What would happen if we add together one SUBTRACTIVE  color  and one
       ADDITIVE color of light?

                           Red    +   Cyan    = White Light
                           (green +   blue)

                           Blue   +   Yellow  = White Light
                           (red   +   green)

                           Green  +   Magenta = White Light
                           (red   +   blue)

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       COMPLIMENTARY PAIRS

       Complimentary pairs are  the  combination  of  one  additive and one
       subtractive color together to recreate white light.

       If you keep in mind that the subtractive  colors  are made up of two
       additive colors, by adding the remaining additive color we get white
       light again.

                          Blue is complementary to Yellow
                          Green is complementary to Magenta
                          Red is complementary to Cyan

       In most of the situations where we find color, it has  been  derived
       through the subtractive process.  Paintings, photographic prints and
       color negative film  all  rely  on  the SUBTRACTIVE colors to create
       color.

       The most common application of the  additive  colors  is television.
       It uses a combination of red, green and blue dots to  create a color
       picture on the screen.

       FILTERS

       A filter is a device that will block out certain amounts or kinds of
       light.

       A NEUTRAL FILTER  ABSORBS  EQUAL  AMOUNTS of the red, green and blue
       that make up  the white light.  The  transmitted  colors,  or  those
       allowed to pass, are the same as the original colors,  just  not  as
       intense.

                               NEUTRAL FILTER

         WHITE       RED>>>>>>>>>>>>>NNN>>>>>>>>>>RED        all
         LIGHT RAYS  GREEN>>>>>>>>>>>NNN>>>>>>>>>>GREEN     colors
                     BLUE>>>>>>>>>>>>NNN>>>>>>>>>>BLUE       pass

       Neutral shades of  sunglasses  produce  this  effect of reducing the
       intensity of the colors without changing the colors themselves.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       In the photographic process, subtractive  colors  are used to create
       color.  Color filters are used to SELECTIVELY choose  what  color we
       want to see while eliminating other unwanted colors from light.  The
       use of filters  is  basic  to  the understanding of how photographic
       film and paper are designed to reproduced the colors of the subject.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       If a RED filter is placed in front  of  a  beam  of white light, you
       will see the  color  RED.   Red  light  is allowed  to  pass  or  be
       transmitted through while  the  green  and blue light are blocked or
       absorbed.

                                 RED FILTER

         WHITE       RED>>>>>>>>>>>>>RRR>>>>>>>>>>RED    only RED
         LIGHT RAYS  GREEN>>>>>>>>>>>RRR                 passes through
                     BLUE>>>>>>>>>>>>RRR

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       If a GREEN filter is placed in front  of  a beam of white light, you
       will see the color GREEN.  Green light is transmitted  through while
       the red and blue light is absorbed.

                                 GREEN FILTER

         WHITE       RED>>>>>>>>>>>>>GGG                 only GREEN
         LIGHT RAYS  GREEN>>>>>>>>>>>GGG>>>>>>>>>>GREEN  passes through
                     BLUE>>>>>>>>>>>>GGG

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       If a BLUE  filter  is  placed in front of a beam of white light, you
       will see the color BLUE.  Blue light  is  transmitted  through while
       the red and green light are absorbed.

         WHITE       RED>>>>>>>>>>>>>BBB                only BLUE
         LIGHT RAYS  GREEN>>>>>>>>>>>BBB                passes through
                     BLUE>>>>>>>>>>>>BBB>>>>>>>>>>BLUE

                 Remember that ANY filter TRANSMITS ITS OWN COLOR.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       If you place  a  CYAN  filter in front of a beam of white light, you
       will find the RED light is ABSORBED  while  the BLUE and GREEN light
       are TRANSMITTED.  This is because CYAN is MADE UP of  BLUE and GREEN
       and a CYAN filter TRANSMITS its own color.

                                 CYAN FILTER
                               (full strength)
         WHITE       RED>>>>>>>>>>>>>CCC                 only GREEN & BLUE
         LIGHT RAYS  GREEN>>>>>>>>>>>CCC>>>>>>>>>>GREEN  passes through
                     BLUE>>>>>>>>>>>>CCC>>>>>>>>>>BLUE
                                (absorbs RED)

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       If you place a MAGENTA filter in front of a beam of white light, you
       will find the  GREEN  light is ABSORBED while the RED and BLUE light
       are TRANSMITTED.  This is because  MAGENTA  is  a combination of RED
       and BLUE.

                               MAGENTA FILTER
                               (full strength)
         WHITE       RED>>>>>>>>>>>>>MMM>>>>>>>>>>RED    only RED & BLUE
         LIGHT RAYS  GREEN>>>>>>>>>>>MMM                 passes through
                     BLUE>>>>>>>>>>>>MMM>>>>>>>>>>BLUE
                               (absorbs GREEN)

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       If you place a YELLOW filter in front of a beam of  white light, you
       will find the  BLUE  light is ABSORBED while the RED and GREEN light
       are TRANSMITTED.  This is because YELLOW is a combination of RED and
       GREEN.

                                YELLOW FILTER
                               (full strength)
         WHITE       RED>>>>>>>>>>>>>YYY>>>>>>>>>>RED    only RED & GREEN
         LIGHT RAYS  GREEN>>>>>>>>>>>YYY>>>>>>>>>>GREEN  passes through
                     BLUE>>>>>>>>>>>>YYY
                               (absorbs BLUE)

       Each subtractive filter   ABSORBS   ONE   COLOR   of   light   while
       TRANSMITTING the other TWO COLORS.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Often, it is  necessary to use more than one filter  at  a  time  to
       obtain the desired  results  of blocking out ALL BUT ONE COLOR.  The
       following diagrams illustrate how  a  set of two SUBTRACTIVE filters
       work together to filter out ALL BUT ONE COLOR from  a  beam of white
       light.

                            MAGENTA       CYAN
                             FILTER       FILTER
         WHITE       RED>>>>>>>MMM>>>>>>>>>CCC           only BLUE
         LIGHT RAYS  GREEN>>>>>MMM         CCC           passes through
                     BLUE>>>>>>MMM>>>>>>>>>CCC>>>>>BLUE

       If a MAGENTA  and  CYAN  filter  are  used together, you can see the
       MAGENTA filter ABSORBS the GREEN and TRANSMITS the RED and BLUE.

       Then the CYAN filter ABSORBS the  RED  and  allows  the  BLUE  to be
       TRANSMITTED.

       We know from our triangle that CYAN is made from GREEN and BLUE, but
       since the GREEN was ABSORBED earlier by the MAGENTA filter, there is
       NO GREEN for  the CYAN filter to be TRANSMITTED, resulting  in  only
       the remaining BLUE color.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       If CYAN and  YELLOW  are  used together, you can see the CYAN filter
       ABSORBS the RED and allows the BLUE  and  GREEN  to  be TRANSMITTED.
       Then the YELLOW filter absorbs the BLUE and allows  the  GREEN to be
       TRANSMITTED.

       From our triangle  we  see  YELLOW  is  made from RED and GREEN, but
       since the RED was ABSORBED earlier  by  the CYAN filter, there is no
       RED for the  YELLOW  filter  to  TRANSMIT,  resulting  in  only  the
       remaining GREEN color.

                              CYAN        YELLOW
                             FILTER       FILTER
         WHITE       RED>>>>>>>CCC         YYY           only GREEN
         LIGHT RAYS  GREEN>>>>>CCC>>>>>>>>>YYY>>>>>GREEN passes through
                     BLUE>>>>>>CCC>>>>>>>>>YYY

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       If you use  the  MAGENTA  and  YELLOW  filters together, you see the
       MAGENTA filter ABSORBS the GREEN and  allows  the RED and BLUE to be
       TRANSMITTED.  The YELLOW filter then ABSORBS the BLUE  and TRANSMITS
       the RED.

       From the triangle,  we  can  see  that  YELLOW  is made from RED and
       GREEN, but since  the MAGENTA filter  ABSORBED  the  GREEN  earlier,
       there is no GREEN, leaving only the remaining RED color.

                             MAGENTA      YELLOW
                             FILTER       FILTER
         WHITE       RED>>>>>>>MMM>>>>>>>>>YYY>>>>>RED   only RED
         LIGHT RAYS  GREEN>>>>>MMM         YYY           passes through
                     BLUE>>>>>>MMM>>>>>>>>>YYY

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       With the YELLOW  filter  first,  we  see the BLUE  is  ABSORBED  and
       TRANSMITS the RED  and  GREEN.   When  the  RED  and GREEN reach the
       MAGENTA filter, the  GREEN  is  ABSORBED   and   the  RED  light  is
       transmitted.


                                      Page 5





       From the triangle,  we  know  MAGENTA is made from RED and BLUE, but
       since the YELLOW filter ABSORBED  the  BLUE  earlier,  only  the RED
       component remained to be transmitted.

                             YELLOW       MAGENTA
                             FILTER       FILTER
         WHITE       RED>>>>>>>YYY>>>>>>>>>MMM>>>>>RED   only RED
         LIGHT RAYS  GREEN>>>>>YYY>>>>>>>>>MMM           passes through
                     BLUE>>>>>>YYY         MMM

       As this comparison showed, it really isn't important  in which order
       the two filters  are  used,  the single color that remains is ALWAYS
       the same.  Referring to the color  triangle will help keep the color
       relationships straight for you.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Now, what would happen if you put ALL THREE SUBTRACTIVE  filters  in
       front of a light beam?

       As you can see, the combination of all THREE FILTERS TOTALLY ABSORBS
       ALL of the  light  and NO COLORS are allowed to pass through.  Equal
       intensity filters of CYAN, MAGENTA and YELLOW make up what is called
       a NEUTRAL FILTER.  This means that  the  color of light seen will be
       NEUTRAL or HAVE NO COLOR.

                             MAGENTA  CYAN    YELLOW
                             FILTER   FILTER  FILTER
         WHITE       RED>>>>>MMM>>>>>>>CCC     YYY         NO LIGHT
         LIGHT RAYS  GREEN>>>MMM       CCC     YYY         passes through
                     BLUE>>>>MMM>>>>>>>CCC>>>>>YYY

       Up to this point, we have been talking about FULL STRENGTH  filters.
       In other words,  a  full  strength  CYAN filter would ABSORB all RED
       light and TRANSMIT GREEN and BLUE light.

       It is possible to VARY THE INTENSITY  of  the  filter  so  that SOME
       amount of colored light will be ABSORBED.  This means  that  a LOWER
       INTENSITY CYAN filter  would  ABSORB  some RED and TRANSMIT some RED
       light alown WITH the GREEN and BLUE light.

                                 CYAN FILTER
         WHITE       RED>>>>>>>>>>>>>CCC> > > > > RED     only some RED
         LIGHT RAYS  GREEN>>>>>>>>>>>CCC>>>>>>>>>>GREEN   FULL GREEN
                     BLUE>>>>>>>>>>>>CCC>>>>>>>>>>BLUE    FULL BLUE

       If we CHANGE THE INTENSITY OF A NEUTRAL  FILTER,  we  will  vary the
       intensity of RED,  GREEN,  and  BLUE light TRANSMITTED.   Since  the
       filter is NEUTRAL,  the  RED, GREEN, and BLUE light will be in EQUAL
       AMOUNTS causing the light to APPEAR NEUTRAL in color.

       The table below will serve as a reference  to  the three SUBTRACTIVE
       colors that are  most  commonly used as filters in  color  film  and
       paper construction.  Always keep in mind the COMPLEMENTARY PAIRS.

                                   (YELLOW)

       It is important  to mention here that so far we have been discussing
       filters that are  ideal,  or  perfect,   meaning  they  absorbe  the
       complimentary color completely.

       In reality, this is not so.  The filters are NOT PERFECT, so a small
       amount of the complimentary color does get transmitted,  and a small
       amount of the  other two colors are absorbed.  However, it should be
       noted that the change in intensity will not create a problem.

       One must remember that we are dealing with PURE colors.

       Shades of pure and complimentary  colors  arise  from  the action of
       imperfect filtering.  Therefore, color correction/compensation  must
       ultimately be decided by the viewer.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       A REVIEW

       WHITE LIGHT is  comprised  of  EQUAL  AMOUNTS OF RED, GREEN and BLUE
       light added together.  Thus, red,  green  and  blue  are  called the
       PRIMARY COLORS of light.

       We can also create color by ABSORBING RED, GREEN or  BLUE from white
       light using SUBTRACTIVE COLOR filters, CYAN, MAGENTA, and YELLOW.

                      ANY FILTER TRANSMITS ITS OWN COLOR AND
                         ABSORBS ITS COMPLIMENTARY COLOR.

          CYAN absorbs RED light and allows BLUE and GREEN light to pass.
        MAGENTA absorbs GREEN light and allows BLUE and RED light to pass.
            YELLOW absorbs BLUE light and allows RED and GREEN to pass.

       When two or  more  filters  are  used together, it doesn't matter in
       which order they are placed, the result will be the same.

       When all three subtractive filters  of equal intensity are combined,
       the result is a NEUTRAL FILTER.

       When placed in front of a beam of white light, the light transmitted
       will be NEUTRAL in color and its BRILLIANCE depends on the intensity
       of the filter.

       Filters are not  perfect in design, so a very small  amount  of  the
       color of light  that  should  be absorbed actually does pass through
       the filter.
