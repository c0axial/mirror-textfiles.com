                                Theory and Formula
                             of Aqueous Disintegration

       (The following is  from  the Bloomfield Moore book on Keely entitled
       "Keely and His Discoveries".  The  instrument  to which it refers is
       believed to be his Compound Disintegrator.)

       The peculiar conditions as associated with the gaseous  elements  of
       which water is  composed,  as  regards  the  differential volume and
       gravity of its gases, make it a ready  and  fit subject of vibratory
       research.

       In submitting water to the influence of vibratory transmission, even
       on simple thirds,  the  high  action  induced  on  the  hydrogen  as
       contrasted with the  one  on  the  oxygen  (under the same vibratory
       stream), causes the antagonism between  these  elements that induces
       dissociation.

       The DIFFERENTIAL ANTAGONISTIC  RANGE  OF  MOTION, so  favouring  the
       antagonistic thirds as TO BECOME THOROUGHLY REPELLENT.

       The gaseous element  thus  induced and registered shows thousands of
       times much greater force AS REGARDS  TENUITY  and  VOLUME  than that
       induced by the chemical disintegration of heat, on the same medium.

       In all molecular dissociation or disintegration of  both  simple  or
       compound elements, whether  gaseous  or solid, a stream of VIBRATORY
       ANTAGONISTIC THIRDS, SIXTHS, OR NINTHS,  ON  THEIR  MASS CHORDS WILL
       COMPEL PROGRESSIVE SUBDIVISIONS.

       In the disintegration  of  water the instrument is  set  on  THIRDS,
       SIXTHS, and NINTHS, to get the best effects.

       These triple conditions  are  FOCALIZED  (focussed)  on  the neutral
       centre of said  instrument  so  as  to  induce  perfect  HARMONY  or
       CONCORDANCE to the chord-note of the mass-chord of  the instrument's
       full combination; after  which the DIATONIC and the ENHARMONIC scale
       located at the  top  of  the  instrument,  or  ring,  is  thoroughly
       harmonized with the SCALE OF NINTHS which is placed  at  the base of
       the vibratory transmitter with the telephone head.

       The next step is to disturb the harmony on the concentrative thirds,
       between the transmitter and disintegrator.  This is done by ROTATING
       THE SYREN so  as  to  induce  a  SYMPATHETIC COMMUNICATION along the
       nodal transmitter, or wire, that associates the two instruments.

       When the note of the syren becomes  CONCORDANT TO THE NEUTRAL CENTRE
       of the disintegrator, the highest order of sympathetic communication
       is established.

       It is now necessary to operate the transferable vibratory negatizer,

                                      Page 1





       or negative accelerator,  which  is  seated  in  the  centre  of the
       diatonic and enharmonic ring, at the  top  of the disintegrator, and
       COMPLETE DISINTEGRATION WILL FOLLOW (from the ANTAGONISMS induced on
       the CONCORDANTS by said adjunct), in triple progression, thus:


        First, thirds  -  (to achieve) Molecular dissociation resolving the
                          water into  a gaseous compound  of  hydrogen  and
                          oxygen.

        Second, sixths  -   resolving  the  hydrogen  and oxygen into a new
                          element by    second   order   of   dissociation,
                          producing what I call, LOW ATOMIC ETHER.

        Third, ninths  -  the low atomic ether resolved into a NEW ELEMENT,
                          which I   denominate   high  or   second   atomic
                          harmonic.

       ALL THESE TRANSMISSIONS  BEING  SIMULTANEOUS  ON  THE DISTURBANCE OF
       SYMPATHETIC EQUILIBRIUM BY SAID NEGATIVE ACCELERATOR.

       Example

            Taking the chord mass of the disintegrator B flat, or any chord
            mass that may be represented by the combined association of all
            the mechanical parts of its structure  (no two structures being
            alike in their chord masses),

            Taking B flat, the resonators of said structure  are  set  at B
            flat, first  octave,  B  flat,  third octave, and B flat, ninth
            octave, by drawing out the caps  of  the  resonators  until the
            harmony of  thirds,  sixths,  and ninths are reached;  which  a
            simple movement  of  the  fingers on the diatonic scale, at the
            head, will determine by the  tremulous  action  which is highly
            sensible to the touch, on said caps.

            The caps are then rigidly fixed in their different positions by
            setscrews.

       Vangard note >>>
              Resonators as  used  by  Keely  are  small   tubes   with  an
              adjustable cap.   This allowed the  resonant frequency of the
              tubes to  be set to a variety  of  frequencies  much  like  a
              variable oscillator.  When the tube is tuned  to  the  proper
              frequency, the cap is locked into position by setscrews.

              The resonator  tube  caps  could  be  touched to indicate the
              degree of vibration.  When a mechanical syren was excited, it
              would produce  a  high  pitched  sound  which  would  descend
              through the  scale,  the  tuned resonators would  respond  to
              their particular  frequency  as  sensed  by  the touch of the
              operator to the vibrating caps.   At  the resonant frequency,
              the caps  would be at greatest amplitude and  therefore  most
              easily detectable by touch.                               <<<

       The focalization to  the  neutral  centre  is  then  established  by
       dampening the steel rods, on the scale at the back, representing the
       thirds, sixths, and ninths, drawing  a  piece of small gum tube over
       them, which establishes harmony to the chord mass of the instrument.

       Concordance is thus  effected  between  the  disintegrator  and  the
       ninths of the  scale  at  the  base   of  the  transmitters  in  the
       telephonic head.

       This scale has a permanent sympathetic one, set on  the ninth of any
       mass chord that  may  be  represented,  on  any and all the multiple
       variations of mechanical combinations.  In fact, permanently set for
       universal accommodation.

       The next step is to establish pure  harmony  between the transmitter
       and the disintegrator,  which is done by spinning  the  syren  disk,
       then waiting until  the  sympathetic  note  is reached, as the syren
       chord, decreasing in velocity, descends the scale.

       AT THIS JUNCTURE, the negative accelerator  must  be IMMEDIATELY AND
       RAPIDLY ROTATED, INDUCING  HIGH  DISTURBANCE OF EQUILIBRIUM  between
       the transmitter and disintegrator by TRIPLE NEGATIVE EVOLUTION,

       with the result  that  a FORCE OF FROM FIVE TO TEN, FIFTEEN, TWENTY,
       AND THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS TO THE  SQUARE  INCH  IS  EVOLVED  BY THE
       FOCALIZATION OF THIS  TRIPLE  NEGATIVE STREAM ON THE  DISINTEGRATING
       CELL, OR CHAMBER,

       whether there be  ONE,  TWO,  THREE  FIVE,  OR  TEN  DROPS  OF WATER
       enclosed within it.
