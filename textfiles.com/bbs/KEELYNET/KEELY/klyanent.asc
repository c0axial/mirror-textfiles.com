The following file is excerpted from Lippincott magazine, 1887 - "Our Monthly
Gossip", pages 602-603, which I copied from the Philadelphia Free Library in
October of 1995.

It is a description of Keely's motor by an engineer of the time which I
thought reflected much of the frustration that I have seen from modern day
Keely researchers when wading through all the Victorian descriptions of his
experiments and machines.

But there are nonetheless nuggets of genius which can be extracted by the
astute student even from Mrs. Moore's flowery descriptions........>>> Jerry

If you care to have the views of a practical engineer on the subject of "The
Keely Motor Secret," I take pleasure in giving them to you, as follows:

  "I have seen Mr. Keely's motor in operation, and I am obliged to say as an
   engineer that in my judgment there is nothing particularly new in the
   entire subject.  It is a reproduction of force by well-known means."

  "The shrouding of this Keely motor business in words and sentences void of
   rational meaning in order to surround the simplest facts with an air of
   mystery has been during the entire life of the undertaking one of the most
   amusing features of the scheme."

  "Boscovitch's hypothesis of the constitution of matter, which may almost be
   considered the foundation of analytical mechanics, contains the very
   essence of the so-called Keely motor."

  "This motor is clearly nothing more or less than the generation of an
   elastic conditon of air, gas, or vapor produced by causing the molecules of
   the gas acted upon to vibrate violently in a containing vessel, and from
   thence it is allowed to escape in this strained condtion in order to
   produce a development of power in any way that may be thought desirable."

  "The production of steam is a similar development of power, - viz.:

   1.  The vibraton of water by means of a form of motion known as heat causes
       it to assume an elastic condition of vapor, and

   2.  The vibration of air, gas, or vapor by means of a form of motion known
       as sound causes it to assume an elastic condition.

   There is not the slightest difference, scientifically speaking, in the two
   actions.  Similar causes produce similar results."

  "The etheric vapor or ether, whichs is so much spoken of as a great
   discovery by Mr. Keely, was known and acknowledged before he was born.
   Unquestionably it pervades all space and all substances, and without its
   presence in space and matter the transmission of heat, light, sound and
   electricity cannot be accounted for."

  "The old law of action and reaction being equal, contrary, and simultaneous
   is shown in the actual movement of Mr. Keely's motor, and were the law
   untrue, his machine, as I saw it, would remain perfectly stationary;
   neither does he produce something out of nothing, as stated by some of
   those interested with him, for the very force employed to produce the sound
   which starts the action of his machine requires the consumption of some
   description of fuel, either animal, vegetable, or mineral, for its
   generation, and the resulting action of his engine is dependent upon an
   original expenditure of power."

  "Whether Mr. Keely can ever make a machine upon the principle in question,
   which will be a practical and economical motor, I have the gravest doubts,
   but it is time that those interested in his schemes should make themselves
   acquainted with the fundamental laws and facts of accepted physics, and
   they will then find that what they consider mysteries of inscrutable power
   are in plain English nothing more nor less than interesting experiments in
   acoustics and mechanics."

Vanguard Notes

Charles and Clara Bloomfield Moore were patrons and supporters of The Franklin
Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the late 1900's.  Clara Bloomfield
Moore was an ardent supporter of the research of John Worrell Keely and wrote
numerous articles extolling the virtues and implications of his discoveries.

Mrs. Moore also wrote the single most available book in modern times about
Keely, "Keely's Secrets".  I was disappointed that the Franklin Institute had
an exhibit on acoustics and mechanics along with an exhibit of 'Perpetual
Motion' machines which did not include Keely.  Though Keely was adamant that
his machine was NOT perpetual motion but derived its power from the aether
flows into mass aggregate neutral centers.  A properly tuned machine such as
Keely's Motor would run continually from a single introductory impulse until
the harmonious vibrations were suppressed, discontinued or the parts wore out.

Our friend Vic Hansen of Dyke, Iowa, visited the Franklin Institute in the
early 1960's when they had a sale of old antique equipment.  He found what was
called a Keely Motor and managed to purchase it for $1,000.  This machine
consists of a flywheel driven by two vacuum bulbs with pistons.  Dale Pond and
Vic carried out many experiments trying to get it to run on its own, but could
not get it to work.

They forced water through it to observe its action and noticed the engine
seemed to create a large number of bubbles when the pistons withdrew producing
cavitation.  As the bubbles imploded, the intense inward pressures produced a
water hammer effect to provide intense reverse forces.

This high pressure implosion causes the camshaft to rapidly rotate much like
the one in an automobile.  When the gasoline explodes against the moveable
cylinders, they produce successive positive thrusts which turn the driveshaft.
In this case, the flywheel is driven which drives a belt to do useful work.  I
have some excellent color photos I took of the Vic's engine which will soon be
scanned in for your examination.  I will call it VICMOTOR.GIF.

The point here is wonderfully coincident with current research being done with
heat pumps using compound chemicals to produce the steam.  This is based on
early research where benzen was combined with water and heated.  Benzene has a
lower vaporization temperature than water, so when it was rapidly heated, it
would literally explode, carrying the water into its vaporization region and
producing steam and thrust very efficiently.  That steam was cooled via a heat
exchanger and recycled.

In 1994, Bernard Schaeffer of Germany succeeded in getting a patent for a
special heat pump which used 5 different fluids, each with a successively
higher vaporization temperature.  I don't yet have this patent and am going on
descriptions provided by various other KeelyNetters.  When these compound
fluids are rapidly heated, vaporization occurs in a cascade up to water.  The
efficiency is said to be phenomenal.

The technique is near harmonic in the way it works, the same thing as Keely
claimed made his motors and other devices work.  Keely used harmonic
mechanical tuning of the components which comprised the motor in its aggregate
form, to produce a sustained wave motion to make the motor spin.

Only recently have scientists succeeded in achieving this single wave motion
in matter in the form of the Bose Einstein Condensate at the Boulder, Colorado
Joint Institute for Astrophysics.  In a July 14th, Dallas Morning News
article, thoughtfully brought to my attention by my co-worker Katherine Bunch,
the discovery of the creation of matter in a new 'SuperAtom' state is
detailed.  In an article written by Dan Davidson and Jerry Decker, published
in the July 1995 issue of Extraordinary Sciences (written in October of 1994),
we pointed out that an effect could be produced in matter that would create

   'a homogeneous nuclear movement across ALL THE ATOMS in UNISON.  If a mass
    is rotated or vibrated then all the atoms and hence the atomic nuclei
    move/vibrate IN UNISON (i.e. SYNCHRONOUSLY).  The same is happening
    whether the material being levitated is SONICALLY vibrated or MECHANICALLY
    rotated.  Both instances are cases of the TOTAL MASS (i.e. all the atoms
    in the material) being moved synchronously.'

This could be done by an advanced understanding of Keely's description of how
a mass could be 'graduated' to rid it of any discontinuities (knots or
interferences) which restrict the flow of energy through it, including
aether/zpe.  We claim it can be done using sound, rotation or other forces
which polarize and collimate matter to enhance energy transfer, both on the
macro level of electricity/magnetism as well as the aetheric/zpe level which
produces more amazing phenomena.  This was first postulated publicly via the
KeelyNet Roundtable mailer for October 1994 and listed on KeelyNet as
VSRTOCT.94.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extracted from the VSRTOCT.94 mailer

Something really amazing seems to be congealing in the minds of many people
with whom we all have been in contact or read about.  It relates to what
appears to be a Universal Principle manifesting in nature as a CYCLOID.
KeelyNet has long promoted the idea that geometry, frequency and spin are key
elements necessary to achieve much of the phenomena we are trying to qualify
and eventually quantify through a working and reproducible device.

Victor Schauberger proved the Cycloid form was most easily created by use of
an egg shaped flow pattern.  Rudolph Steiner also said the heart shaped flow
produced an inflowing, life-giving rotation which nature used when building
new life, healing or accumulating energy.  The life-enhancing effects can be
augmented by using magnets, crystals, copper and other elements in the right
combinations.  Now, there have arisen numerous correlations in the field of
inertial and gyroscopic drives from researchers such as Dean, Cook,
Laithwaite, Kidd and Thornsen among others.

One must realize that there is a difference between an inertial drive such as
promoted by Dean, Cook and Thornsen and the precession effects of gyroscopic
drives as investigated by Laithwaite and Kidd.  In the case of inertial
drives, the ideal system involves the creation of a cycloid motion, currently
achieved by a complex mechanical rotation of one or more spinning weights.

The simplest form is a spring with a weight attached to the end of it and
mounted on a rotating disk.  You can see how the weighted spring can be
released at the same point in the rotation of the disk to give a hopping
action in a single preferred direction.

The spring slowly pulls the weight closer to the shaft as the disk spins away
from the direction of the hopping motion, this allows the spring to 'recharge'
during each rotation.  The device then moves in short hops only in one
preferred direction through the inertia of the moving weight when it is
released at the same point during the disk rotation.

In the case for gyroscopic precession, a perpendicular motion in relation to
the angular spin of the gyroscope will also produce a lifting force against
the weight of the gyroscope.  The claims are that weight is not eliminated but
reduced from its norm.  It is felt that further research along this line will
yield a levitating device.

But the reason I'm writing about this, is because of a fascinating discovery
made in Russia by Alexander Chernetski and tentatively called the PLASMATRON.
In our past meetings we have discussed MagnetoHydroDynamics (MHD) and the
possibilities it presented as an over-unity device.  An ionized gas that was
'supercharged' with high density magnetic flux seems to exhibit certain
properties which Chernetskii claims to take advantage of.  His description of
the process;

 "The self-generating discharge (SGD) emerges when the discharge current
  reaches a definite critical density, when the magnetic fields they create
  ensure magnetisation of plasma electrons and they begin to perform MOSTLY
  CYCLOID movements.  The interaction of currents with their magnetic fields
  forces the electrons to deviate to the cylinder-shaped discharge axis and
  the electrical field emerges.  It has proved to 'switch on' the physical
  vacuum; in this field the vacuum is polarized and consequently the virtual
  pairs begin to move IN A DEFINITE DIRECTION, instead of chaotically.  The
  current in the circuit builds up and additional energy is discharged on the
  resistor (that is) switched into the discharge circuit (load).  Clearly,
  only part of the tremendous vacuum energy is extracted."

Note if you will, once the cycloid pattern is achieved, a specific direction
of thrust is generated to force all loose electrons to be thrown off at
whatever happens to be in its path, in the Chernetskii case, an energy
collector absorbs the energy and then switches out the excess energy to a
load, such as a motor, light bulb or other device that performs a useful
service.  So, this is the same process as the inertial drive, except instead
of using the rotation of a MECHANICAL part, we are using the spinning of the
plasma, and instead of a weight, we are using a magnetic flux of a CRITICAL
DENSITY.

John Keely referred to the use of an apsidal motion as a means of crude
propulsion as far back as 1893 and used it to PROPEL his airship in a
demonstration to the War Department in 1896.  Levitation is one thing,
propulsion is quite another.  Once you understand how the cycloid motion can
be used in any rotating mass to produce a linear thrust, you can then extend
it into microscopic reaches to help explain phenomena that borders on magic.

Are not all molecules made up of atoms?  And are those atoms not in turn made
up of electrons spinning around a heavier nucleus?  So, if you could put a
dimple in the orbit of the electron in such a way that it would produce a
minute off balance thrust, you would get a slight deflection as if you pinched
a watermelon seed between your finger and it shot out.  Of course, the amount
of deflection will be very slight but can be amplified by adding to the
'weight' of the electron by increasing it's density.  When it is released at
the maximum eccentric position of the orbit, an inertial thrust is produced.

Keely said that a mass could be differentiated and essentially tuned so that
ALL COMPONENTS OF IT WOULD BECOME HARMONIZED TO EACH OTHER.  Once this was
done, they all act as little tuning forks.  Because they are so tuned, you can
change the rotation or properties of one and THEY ALL CHANGE SIMULTANEOUSLY.
Thus, you could dimple one electron and all others would also dimple IN THE
SAME DIRECTION to produce a MASS THRUST.  You then have a way of moving mass
without needing a transmission, something to react against or any visible
means of driving it beyond the circuitry necessary to create the effect.  This
could lead to all kinds of new technologies if it could be realized as a prime
mover.  As you can see, the applications of the cycloid motion are manifold
and ripe for further research.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The actual Bose Einstein Condensate discovery;

Physicist Carl Wieman and Eric Cornell said, "This is a state of matter that's
unlike anything that's existed before."  Albert Einstein determined 71 years
ago that such matter could exist.  At 10:45AM on June 5, after 6 years of
trying, Dr. Wieman and several colleagues condensed a tiny clump of about
2,000 rubidium atoms into a 'superatom' that BEHAVES AS A SINGLE UNIT.  Rice
University physicist, Randall Hulet succeeded in duplicating the experiment at
6AM Wednesday morning.  The Colorado research is being published Friday in the
journal SCIENCE.

Einstein showed that near absolute zero Fahrenheit - some atoms can enter a
state where they are INDISTINGUISHABLE from one another.  In such a condition,
Einstein demonstrated that all of the atoms would be at the same ENERGY LEVEL,
or quantum state.  Quantum state is what distinguishes one atom from the next.
So packing a whole bunch of atoms together, then making them SO COLD that they
can ONLY be in the LOWEST possible quantum state, makes the atoms
indistinguishable and CAUSES THEM TO BEHAVE AS ONE.

This unusual form of matter is known as a Bose-Einstein Condensate.  They also
have suspected that the phenomenon, or something similar to it, is behind
PHYSICAL ODDITIES such as superconductivity, in which some substances conduct
electricity without resistance.  (If they only knew the range of phenomena
that will be possible when achieving this effect AT ROOM TEMPERATURE using the
techniques we elucidate!!!)

Because a Bose-Einstein condensate offers the same control over a beam of
atoms that lasers offer over beams of light, the new form of matter might be
the perfect material for new tiny electronic devices.  Under the rules of
quantum mechanics, extremely cold atoms begin to behave more like WAVES than
particles.  "They get more and more wave-like as they move slower and slower,"
Dr. Cornell said.  "Then they have sort of an identity crisis, and this crisis
is called Bose-Einstein condensation."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only Keely's early motor experiments used an elastic vapor as Mr. Thayer
describes in the preceding text.  As further experiments led to ever greater
understanding about how to control the forces he evoked, he learned to produce
harmonious wave motion in mass aggregations in a more controlled fashion.

Eventually, he could sustain and amplify these vibrations to produce wave
motion in matter, evoking the resonances from within the mass itself to
continue operation once an 'introductory impulse' had been imparted.  Keely
might even have tapped into the free space resonance frequency of about 47Mhz.

One of the phenomena noted by Keely and others who have succeeded in altering
aether/ZPE/gravity flows is a zone of cold around the operating equipment.
Isn't it odd that super-cold is required by 'orthodox science' to produce the
wave phenomena?  How much closer are we now, Mr. Wizard?

The Vanguard Sciences Research Center could be entirely funded over a 5 year
period with 12 million dollars of capital.  Such a center would allow us to
consolidate our many contacts, as well as coordinate, fund and promote many
practical alternative research projects, qualify and quantify the associated
phenomena and develop/market products that would produce wonders in our lives.

This includes offering educational programs to re-stimulate thinking and
experimentation in alternative science areas in all segments of society, using
conferences, public and school demonstrations, mass media exploitation and
networking via computers and interested groups and individuals.

We have a network of contacts and fellow experimenters who could rapidly
progress towards practical, MARKETABLE devices from their ideas and
experiments with appropriate funding.  I believe we are so very close to
rediscovering how gravity and 'weight' can be reduced in matter in a practical
sense.  A crude form of energy generation can thus be easily accomplished
using a controlled flow of gravity in a manner analogous to a waterwheel
driving a shaft which drives a generator.

Think about it...should we try to start a church to get this funding?  Maybe
an investment group or private venture deal, I have no idea at this point, but
if you know someone who might be open to discussing the funding of such a
project, please promote KeelyNet and the Research Center , it would make a
world of difference to a lot of people..................thanks...>>>  Jerry
