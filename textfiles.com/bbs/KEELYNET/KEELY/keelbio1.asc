                               Mini-Bio of :
                         John Ernst Worrell Keely
                       Sept. 3, 1827 - Nov. 18, 1898

    Inventor and imposter,  grew  up  in  Philadelphia, Pa., where his
    career was run.  Both his parents  died while he was an infant and
    he is not known to have had any schooling after the age of twelve.

    He had been for a time leader of a small orchestra  and in certain
    more or less apocryphal stories he figured as a circus performer.

    In 1872 he  was a journeyman carpenter, but in the following year,
    when he announced the discovery of  a new physical force, he seems
    to have ceased that occupation for the rest of his days, and for a
    quarter of a century he was a public character, maintained  by the
    contributions of those   who   believed   in  the  future  of  the
    inventions based on his discovery.

    The supposed new force was explained  by  Keely  as resulting from
    the intermolecular vibrations of ether (Aether).

    His problem was  to  construct  a  machine  to  respond   to   the
    vibrations and in  that  way  produce  power.  (Refer to the Melde
    Experiment.) In 1874 he had advanced far enough in the fabrication
    of such a  machine,  or  engine,  to  permit  exhibitions  at  his
    workshop.

    Such results as  he  could  show  amazed the general  public,  but
    physicists and engineers  declared  that the same results could be
    obtained by employing known forces,  and  until  Keely would prove
    the exclusion of such known forces from his experiments they would
    refuse to believe in his discovery.

    Nevertheless, the Keely  Motor  Company was incorporated  and  the
    stock was taken in large amounts throughout the country.

    As time passed  without  the  perfection  of  Keely's motor or the
    securing of patents, the stockholders  grew  impatient and by 1880
    payments to the  inventor virtually ceased and the  bills  he  had
    incurred remained unpaid.

    When bankruptcy was  facing him a wealthy Philadelphia woman, Mrs.
    Clara S. J. Bloomfield-Moore, came  to the rescue and financed his
    operations for many years.

    Meanwhile the Keely  Motor  Company  brought  suit   to  compel  a
    disclosur  of the  secret  and Keely's refusal to answer questions
    led to his imprisonment for contempt of court.

    A compromise was reached, however,  without  the  divulging of the
    secret, and Keely was released.

    In 1887 experiments   were   conducted  for  the   United   States
    Government at Fort  Lafayette.   The  Keely Motor Company retained
    its faith in the inventor and continued to market stocks.

    In 1895 Professor  Lascelles-Scott, the English physicist, spent a
    month in Philadelphia  for the purpose  of  investigating  Keely's
    work, at the request of Bloomfield-Moore.

    His report was  never  published, but after his return  to  London
    Keely's patroness withdrew her assistance.

    Keely was now an old man, afflicted with Bright's disease.
    At his death,  on  Nov. 18, 1898, the Keely Motor Company had more
    than 3,000 shareholders.

    In their interest the company's officers  arranged with the widow,
    Anna M. Keely,  to have a thorough examination  made  of  all  the
    apparatus left in Keely's workshop.

    The ensuing investigation,  friendly  in  motive,  resulted in the
    uncovering of tubes  in  the  form   of   hollow  wires  by  which
    compressed air had been applied to the machinery  claimed  to have
    been operated by the mysterious new force.

    In some instances compressed air had been used to start clockwork,
    but more generally hydraulic power, derived from a water motor.

    The exposure was   complete   and  unanswerable.   A  Philadelphia
    newspaper suggested that the "motor"  be  exhibited to the public,
    but no one had the heart to act on the suggestion.

    Keely's secret was out at last.  But nothing short  of  his  death
    kept the public from trusting him.

     This document  is presented to assist the student of Keely by the
       offering of both pro and con information regarding this man.
         Here the interesting observation of Moores' withdrawal of
                   support as well as Keely's having had
                Brights disease is "new" information to us.
