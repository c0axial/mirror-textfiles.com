                      Vibrations that Split Molecules
                              Produce Energy

    Seawater - or even dirty rainwater - could be transmuted into fuel
    through a new technique serendipitously discovered by a researcher
    in medical electronics.

    Dr. Andrija Puharich  has  found a way to split water molecules by
    tuning in on  the  vibrations of  their  atoms  and  breaking  the
    molecules into hydrogen, which could become fuel, and oxygen.

    Alternating-current impulses augment      naturally      occurring
    vibrations in the  H2O  molecules.  By boosting the vibrations out
    of control, Puharich  makes  the  molecules  fly  apart  into  the
    component atoms.

    He likens the water-splitting effect to the way soldiers  marching
    in step across  a  bridge risk damaging the structure by making it
    vibrate at a critical, stress-producing rate.

    Electrolysis by simple direct current  would  create  hydrogen and
    oxygen with a net energy efficiency of only 54 percent,  according
    to Puharich, a   Virginia-based   inventor.    But   he  says  his
    alternating-current system reaches   better   than   90  per  cent
    efficiency.

    A former   physician,   Puharich  discovered  the  water-splitting
    technique a dozen  years  ago  but has only recently presented his
    findings publicly.

    Originally, he was  investigating   the   DISRUPTIVE   EFFECT   of
    electrical resonances on blood clots and noticed a peculiar thing:
    in dilute blood, a SPECIFIC FREQUENCY made bubbles  appear  in the
    liquid.

    Lab analysis showed  that  the bubbles were composed of oxygen and
    hydrogen.

    A barrel-shaped cavity contains the  water  in Puharich's recently
    refined system.  He  introduces  alternating  current   at  A  KEY
    FREQUENCY of 600 cycles per second.

    The cavity resonates  with  the  impulses in somewhat the same way
    the body of a violin resonates  with  the  sound  of  one  string,
    ADDING HIGHER AND LOWER HARMONICS TO THE PRINCIPAL TONE.

    The additional harmonics, Puharich says, cause the  proton  in the
    hydrogen atom TO  ROTATE,  further  forcing  the hydrogen to split
    from the oxygen.

                                  Page 1




    Puharich suggests that  the  splitting energy could be provided by
    solar or wind generators.  The hydrogen  could  then be stored and
    used conveniently in fuel cells  or hydrogen-powered cars.

    Vangard notes...

    This paper is quite astounding in that it correlates  with Keelys'
    claim that water  can be progressively dissociated at 620, 630 and
    12,000 cycles per second.  These  are on the molecular, atomic and
    etheric levels respectively.

    It is interesting  that the etheric level of 12,000  /  20  =  600
    (Puharich's frequency) found  by  original  experimentation.  This
    600 cps frequency  is therefore  a  harmonic  of  the  12,000  cps
    frequency which Puharich discovered.

    Keely also claims  that the disruption of water occurs  at  42,800
    cycles per second.

    The direct quote  from  the  book  "Keely  and His Discoveries" by
    Bloomfield Moore, published in 1893 ;

         "The orders of intensification  for accelerating dissociation
          would not be understood by any explanations  that  could  be
          made, if  unaccompanied  by  the demonstrations witnessed by
          the late Professor Leidy, Dr. Brinton, and others.

         "When the  ether  flows from  a  tube,  its  negative  centre
          represents molecular  sub-division  carrying  interstitially
          (or between  its  molecules)  the  lowest order of liberated
          ozone.

         "This is  the  first  order  of  ozone  and  its  wonderfully
          refreshing and vitalizing to those who breathe it.

         "The second  order,  or atomic separation,  releases  a  much
          higher grade  of ozone; in fact, too pure for inhalation, is
          the one that has been (though  attended withe much danger to
          the operator)  utilized by Keely in his carbon  register  to
          produce the  circuit  of  high  vibration that breaks up the
          molecular magnetism which is recognized as cohesion.

         "The acceleration  of  these   orders   is  governed  by  the
          introductory impulse on a certain combination  of  vibratory
          chords, arranged  for  this  purpose in the instrument, with
          which Keely dissociates the  elements of water, and which he
          calls a Liberator.

         "In molecular dissociation one fork of 620 is  used,  setting
          the chords on the first octave.

         "In atomic  separation  two  forks, one of 620 and one of 630
          per second; setting the chords on the second octave.

         "In the etheric three forks;  one of 620, one of 630, and one
          of 12,000, setting the chords on the third octave.

    As a matter of further clarification, Keely states that you cannot
    DIRECTLY dissociate a single level of aggregation due to the shell
    structure of matter.
                                  Page 2





    In other words,  if  you  wish to dissociate the Atomic level, you
    must first dissociate the molecular  to  be  able  to  get  to the
    atomic.  That follows also if you wish to dissociate  the etheric,
    you must disrupt the molecular AND the atomic, THEN the etheric.

    Keely refers to this technique as progressive dissociation.

    In 1988, we  had  Andrija Puharich in Dallas for about 4 days as a
    joint speaker for Vangard Sciences  and MUFON Metroplex.  We spent
    many hours with Andrija and discussed a wide variety of subjects.

    At that time, I asked him about this experiment  and  he  said the
    original research was  done in the late 50's, early 60's by him in
    a dual attempt.   One was to selectively  remove  gases  from  the
    blood and the other to dissolve clots.

    Andrija had not  heard of Keely or his work with  dissociation  or
    disruption of matter  with  acoustic  frequencies.   He  was quite
    interested that the work had been  done  almost  100 years ago and
    wanted to know more about Keely.

    Dr. Puharich has dropped out of sight over the last  few years, so
    we have lost  contact  with  him.  He was at that time (1988) very
    concerned about the  ecology and  was  working  on  some  type  of
    retreat for future hard times.

    They were re-building an old hydro-electric power  system fed by a
    small lake on  the  land  they  had in Virginia.  Puharich at that
    time was living on land donated by R.  J.  Reynolds.

    We heard recently that Reynolds  was  attempting  to  get the land
    back.  Since we  have not seen or heard from Andrija  in  about  2
    years, we don't know what is going on with him.

    We hope this information is of use in your researches.
