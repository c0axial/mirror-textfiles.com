                This story was taken from the SNELL MANUSCRIPT
                                      by

                            KEELY'S SECRETS, 1888.

         John Ernest  Worrell  Keely -- the discoverer of compound inter-
    etheric force, as the result of more  than  20  years  of  persistent
    effort to apply  this  force  to the operation of machinery  has,  at
    last, but up  to  this  time, not so mastered this subtle force as to
    control reversions.

         The development  of  his  various   discoveries   has  been  one
    uninterrupted work of evolution, reaching, within the  last  year, he
    thinks, the sphere  of perfect vibratory sympathy, both theoretically
    and practically.

         The proof of this is found in  the  fact  that  he now transmits
    vibrations along a  wire,  connected  at one end with  the  vibratory
    machine which is  the  source  of power and at its other end with the
    engine or cannon, as the case may  be,  which  is  operated  by  such
    vibratory power.

         Until recently  Keely  stored force, as he generated  it,  in  a
    receiver, and experiments  were  made  by  him  in  the  presence  of
    thousands at various times for the  purpose of testing the operations
    of this force, liberated in the presence of the audience  and  stored
    up in this small receiver.

         The editor  of  the Scientific American thus describes what took
    place "The confined  vapor  was  passed  through  one  of  the  small
    flexible tubes to  a  steel  cylinder on another table,  in  which  a
    vertical piston was  fitted  so  that  its upper end bore against the
    underside of a powerful, weighted  lever.   The  superficial  area of
    this piston was equal to one-half of a square inch, and it acted as a
    movable fulcrum placed close to the hinged end of the  short  arm  of
    this lever, whose  weight alone required a pressure of 1500 pounds to
    the square inch against the piston to lift it.

         The maximum test was made to placing  an iron weight of 580 lbs.
    on the extreme end of the long arm of the lever. To  lift this weight
    required a pressure  of  18,900  lbs. to the square inch counting the
    difference in the length of the two arms and the area of the piston.

         When Kelly turned the valve-wheel  leading  from the receiver to
    the flexible tube and through it into the steel cylinder  beneath the
    piston,  simultaneously with  the  motion  of  his  hand the weighted
    lever shot up against its stop a distance  of  several  inches, as if
    the iron were cork.

         Keely then diverted the gas and fired a cannon containing a lead
    bullet about an  inch  in  diameter, which went through an inch board
    and flattened itself to about 3  inches  in  diameter,  with  a  loud
    report.

         Keely's difficulties  with his old generator  of  etheric  force
    grew out of the fact, in part, that the vaporic power produced was so
    humid that he  could  not,  in  utilizing  it, obtain its theoretical
    value in work.   He has overcome this entirely (?) by dispensing with
    water and has attained a success  beyond  that  which  he  originally
    anticipated when he  abandoned his original line of  experiment.  (He
    was obliged to  return  soon  to  his  former  method, for he found a
    difficulty even more obstinate to contend with.)

         The atom is surrounded with a  dynasphere,  or  etheric capsule,
    which prevents the  atoms  from  touching  each  other,  inasmuch  as
    dynasphere is in inconceivable rapid motion.

         Dynaspheric force  is  broadly  divided into two categories: the
    sentient and the non-sentient atoms,  as  the force used mechanically
    by Mr. Keely to his motor.  (Laurence Oliphant.)

         The structure  of  the air molecule according  to  Keely  is  as
    follows: Broken up,  by  vibratory action, he finds it to contain the
    "atomic triplet."

         This exists in a triangular position within the molecule, at its
    center, unless acted upon by electricity,  when  the molecule becomes
    oblate and the three atoms are ranged in a line within  unless broken
    up by vibration.

         Nature never  gives  a vacuum, consequently the space within the
    molecule not occupied  by the atomic  triplet  most  be  filled  with
    something.   This is  where the "all-prevading ether"  has  made  its
    secret abode through untold aeons.

         Keely was  obliged  to  abandon  his  first  and second lines of
    experimental research, baffled   in   applying   vibratory  force  to
    mechanics, and try  a  third  method of departure from  his  base  or
    principle, through another channel of experiment.

         Keely says:  "In  considering  the  operation  of my engine, the
    visitor .... must abandon all thought  of  engines (such as conceived
    with pistons, eccentrics, or working with pressure.)

          "My system --both in the developing of this power  and in every
           branch of  its utilization is based and founded on sympathetic
           vibration.   In no other way would it be possible to awaken or
           develop this  force and equally  impossible  would  it  be  to
           operate my engine upon any other principle.

           All needs  to  be  done  is  to secure a uniform  speed  under
           different velocities and control reversions ... some few years
           ago, I  contemplated using a wire as a connective link between
           two sympathetic mediums,  to  evolve  this  power  as  also to
           operate my  machinery  --instead  of  tubular  connections  as
           heretofore employed   --I  have  only  recently  succeeded  in
           accomplishing such change. This, however, is the true system
           henceforth ... the power will  be  generated,  my engines run,
           cannon operated, through a wire."

          "It has been only after years of incessant labor and the making
           of almost    innumerable    experiments    and   the   closest
           investigation and study of  the  phenomenal  properties of the
           substance "ether" per se, produced that I have  been  able  to
           dispense with complicated mechanism and to obtain, as I claim,
           mastery over  the  subtle  and  strange  force with which I an
           dealing.

          "When my present process of adjustment is completed, the force,
           the mechanism and all that  pertains,  will be fully explained
           in a theoretical exposition ... with appropriate diagrams ...

          "He has   not   succeeded  in  governing  speed   or   stopping
           reversions.

         He has again reduced in size the instrument producing the force.
    From 1882 to   1884   the   "Generator"   was   six   feet  long  and
    correspondingly wide and high, but  failing  to  make the arrangement
    automatic upon which its mechanical usefulness depended,  Keely found
    a new standard  for  research in an experiment often made by himself,
    but never before successful, which  resulted in the invention in 1885
    of the "Liberator" not so large as a lady's small round worktable.

         He made  astonishing  progress  with  this  beautiful  piece  of
    vibratory mechanism,, so  as  to combine the production of the power,
    operation of the  cannon,  his engine  and  his  disintegrator  in  a
    machine no larger than a dinner plate and only three  or  four inches
    in thickness.

         This was  completed  in  1886,  up to which time his experiments
    were upon the principle of sympathetic  vibration,  for  liberating a
    vapory or etheric  produce.   His  later  experiments   were  another
    modification of vibratory  sympathy,  and  the size of the instrument
    used now, 1888,  for  the same purposes  is  no  larger  the  an  old
    fashioned silver watch.

         A pressure of 30,000 lbs.  to the square inch in  raising of the
    lever, and all other operations, without one ounce of pressure in any
    part of the  apparatus,  are  effected  by  the  ether.  The force is
    transmitted along a wire of platinum and silver.

         Keely has named this new modification "Negative Attraction."
    The two forms  of  force  with which  he  has  experimented  and  the
    attendant phenomena, are exactly antithetical.

         It is by changing the vibrations of the cosmic  ether that Keely
    releases this energy.   Dr.   Dupuy, of New York.  experimented along
    these lines for many years, but without  success  to the degree Keely
    had.

         Pure sympathetic  concordants  are as antagonistic  to  negative
    discordants as the  negative  is to the positive, but the vast volume
    the sympathetic holds over the non-sympathetic,  in  ethereal  space,
    makes it at  once the ruling medium and readjuster  of  all  opposing
    conditions if properly brought to bear upon them.

         Keely's discoveries embrace the manner of obtaining the keynote,
    or "chord of  mass,"  of  mineral,  vegetable  and  animal substance,
    therefore the construction of instruments  by  which  this law can be
    utilized is only  a question of full understanding  of  operation  of
    this law.

         Keely estimates that, after the introductory impulse is given on
    the harmonic thirds, molecular vibration is increased form 20,000 per
    second to 100,000,000.

         On the  enharmonic sixths, the vibration of the intermolecule is
    increased to 300,000,000.

         On the diatonic ninths, atomic vibration reaches 900,000,000; on
    the etheric sixths, 8,100,000,000  and  on  the inter-etheric ninths,
    24,300,000,000 all of which can be demonstrated by sound colors.

         Keely believes that the form of energy known as  magnetism,  not
    electricity, is to be the curative agent of the future.   Fifty years
    age Prof. Keil,  of  Jena,  demonstrated  the  susceptibility  of the
    nervous system to  the  influence  of  the  natural  magnet  and  its
    efficacy in the cure of certain infirmities.

         Said Plato: "You ought not to attempt to cure  the  body without
    the soul."

         Beyond disintegration  lies  dispersion,  and  Keely can just as
    easily disperse atoms  of  matter   as  disintegrate  its  molecules,
    dispersing them into ether.

         The law  of gravity appears in the light of Keely's  experiments
    but one manifestation  of  a  law which provides for the reversion of
    the process of attraction in the shape of a process of repulsion.

         Keely, by means of a belt and  certain  appliances which he wore
    upon his person  moved  single-handed,  a  500  horsepower  vibratory
    engine from one part of his shop to another, without a scratch on the
    floor, and astounded  engineers declared it could not have been moved
    without a derrick, to use which would  have  required  the removal of
    the roof.

         Keely announced  in 1888 that he had proved the  uselessness  of
    building engines to  employ  the ether as a motive power, which could
    only be used  as a medium for the  power  which  he  had  discovered,
    namely a condition   of   sympathetic   vibration   associated   both
    positively and negatively with the polar stream.

         The revolving  globe  was  never  created  to  be the "source of
    power" and Keely never affirmed that  he  could  produce  with it "an
    indefinite amount of horse power without current expense."

         S. Zolver Preston, in his "Physics of the Ether" says:

       "A quantity  of matter only 1 gram and of the normal  velocity  of
        the ether,  or  a  wave  of  light  encloses  a  state  of energy
        represented by 1,000,000,000 foot  tons.  Or  the mass of a grain
        contains an energy sufficient to project a weight  of 100 tons to
        a height of 1.9 miles."

         To discover  an  unknown  power is one thing, to subjugate it is
    quite another thing.

         Demonstrating the overcoming  of  gravity, Keely used an airship
    model weighing about  8 lbs., which when the differentiated  wire  of
    silver and platinum  was  attached  to  it,  communicating  with  the
    sympathetic transmitter, rose, descended, or remained stationary

                                    Page 4




    midway, the motion  as  gentle as that of thistledown floating in the
    air.

         The experiment  illustrating   "chord   of  mass"  sympathy  was
    repeated, using a  glass  chamber, 40 inches in height,  filled  with
    water, standing on a slab of glass.

         Three metal  spheres weighing about 6 ounces each, rested on the
    glass floor.   The chord of mass of  these  spheres  was B flat first
    octave, E flat second octave and B flat third octave.

         Upon sounding  the  note B flat on the sympathetic  transmitter,
    the sphere having  that  chord  of mass rose slowly to the top of the
    chamber, the positive end of the  wire  having  been  attached, which
    connected the covered jar with the transmitter.

         The same result followed the sound of the other  spheres, all of
    which descended as gently as they rose, upon changing the positive to
    the negative. J.M.  Wilcox, who was present remarked:

          "This experiment  proves  the  truth  of  a  fundamental law in
           scholastic philosophy, that  when  one  body attracts or seeks
           another body,  it is not that the effect is  the  sum  of  the
           effects produced  by  parts of one body upon parts of another,
           one aggregate of effects, but  the  result of the operation of
           one whole upon another whole."

         The vibrations   induced  by  this  experiments   reached   over
    700,000,000 per second,  unshipping  the  apparatus,  thus  making it
    insecure for a repetition of the experiments.

         The decarbonized steel compressors of said apparatus moved as of
    composed of putty.   Volume  of   sphere   15   cubic  in  weight  of
    surrounding metal, 316 lbs."
