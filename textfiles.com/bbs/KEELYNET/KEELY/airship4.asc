       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Prior to meeting  Wally  Chariton,  I  had  read  his book the TEXAS
       AIRSHIP MYSTERY and  got  to thinking  about  practical  methods  to
       duplicate many of the airship sightings.

       After generating this file, I gave him a copy to see what he thought
       about it.  We  also  discussed Keely and other flight  possiblities.
       Wally said he "wished he had known all this BEFORE writing his book"
       and he would  have  included much of it as additional information in
       his book.

                Analysis of the 1897 Airships -- November 18, 1990
             (inspired by Wallace Chariton's "Texas Airship Mystery")
                    by Jerry W. Decker at KeelyNet 214-324-3501

                 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
       Observations about possible technologies used in the 1897 airships.

       There are several different modes  of flight covered in the combined
       case histories of these mystery airships.

          1)  the Winged airship   - uses wings which flap  to provide lift
                                     as well as propulsion and steering

          2)  the Gas airship      - uses a form of gasbag for lift
                                     and wings or propellers for propulsion
                                     and steering

          3)  the  Aero  airship      -  uses  a  sophisticated type of air
                                     moving  engine in conjunction with the
                                     aerodynamic shape of the ship for both
                                     lift and propulsion

          4)  the  Magnetic  airship  - uses an unknown form  of  magnetic,
                                     Aether or  neutral  center  technology
                                     for lift and propulsion

       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       the Winged Airship

       The Winged airship copies the form of a bird wing in a vastly larger
       size as based on the descriptions  of  the  wings  witnessed.  It is
       possible that a wing surface might be constructed of  a sufficiently
       light material and with the proper "feathering" movements.

                                      Page 1





       This "feathering" movement  would  follow the natural pattern of the
       bird wing in that separate thin plates  would  be  hinged  so that a
       wing moving in a downward motion would cause the  plate  to  take  a
       horizontal position for maximum air movement.

       When the wing  moved  up,  the  hinged plate would assume a vertical
       position for the minimum resistance  to  air flow.  The speed of the
       wing up and down movement would depend on the wing  surface area and
       the thrust velocity necessary to lift the payload.

       Though inefficient when  compared  to  propellers  or  jets,  such a
       device would fly.  There are available  today,  mechanical models of
       birds which fly using just such a flapping motion.

       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       the Gas Airship

       The first airship in modern times was flown by the  Montgolfiers  in
       1783.  It used hot air although other lifting gases such as coal gas
       and hydrogen were used.

       Helium was first  discovered  by  Lockyer  in 1868 while viewing the
       yellow spectral lines of sodium in  rays  from  the sun.  Helium was
       first produced on Earth by Ramsay in 1895 from the mineral clevite.

       One case in  particular mentions a "secret" gas extracted  from  air
       passing through chambers containing certain chemicals.

       In this case, the airship is said to be both propelled and sustained
       by a gas  which  had  the  property of great compressibility under a
       slight pressure and  a correspondingly  great  power  of  expansion.
       Helium fits this description.

       Chemistry rates the elements in order of Terrestrial  Abundance  and
       Cosmic Abundance.  In  terms of Terrestrial Abundance, Helium has no
       listing, yet in terms of Cosmic Abundance, Hydrogen is listed as 3.5
       times 10 to the 8th or 350,000,000 followed closely by Helium at 3.5
       times 10 to the 7th or 35,000,000.

       Now Helium being such a very light  gas,  must  surely be present in
       quantity in the upper stratosphere of the Earth.  Since Hydrogen and
       Oxygen are both  present  in our air, Helium must  also  be  present
       though somewhat rarified.   It  is  not so improbable that a process
       could be envisioned which could remove Helium DIRECTLY from the air.

       Another possibility can be seen in  work  which Nikola Tesla carried
       out prior to  the  turn of the 20th century.  It involved  a  device
       known as a  Tesla Turbine and could compress air to capture Ozone in
       a highly condensed state.

       Tesla indicated that this compressed Ozone was highly efficient AS A
       MOTIVE FORCE.  In fact, Tesla designed a flying device based on this
       very principle, although, to my knowledge it was never built.

       Oxygen as it occurs in nature is referred  to  as "molecular oxygen"
       since it has 2 atoms.  Atomic oxygen on the other  hand  has  only 1
       atom and is  extremely  rare due to its tendency to attach to almost
       anything.  This is the basis for the "free radical" theory of aging.


                                      Page 2





       Ozone is oxygen  with  3  or  more  oxygen  atoms.   It is formed by
       electrical excitation or  ionizing   radiation   in   the   form  of
       ultraviolet light.

       This excitation causes  the  disruption  of  some  molecular  oxygen
       groupings to generate  free  radicals  which bond to the more stable
       molecular oxygen groupings.

       Of course, the Ozone layer is the  hot  topic for the past couple of
       years so we know that Ozone could be used as a lifting or propulsive
       gas.

       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       the Aero Airship

       This type of  airship  is  most intriguing.  It indicates  that  the
       inventor had a   very  sophisticated  understanding  of  aerodynamic
       principles.

       A German Aeronautical engineer came  up with a form of propulsion in
       the late 40's  and early 50's which he termed an AERODYNE.   Not  an
       airplane, since it took full advantage of aerodynamic principles.

       The body of  the  ship  was  an  inverted  teardrop  over  which was
       suspended a propeller, jet or source of high air movement.

       Using the principle of BOUNDARY  LAYER  DRAG,  the  moving  air  was
       ENTRAINED to the surface of the inverted teardrop to  form  a jet of
       highly collimated air as it exited the tip of the teardrop.

       The Boundary Layer  was  first  discovered  by  Prandtl in the early
       1900's.  His work was further improved  upon  by  Tesla,  Coanda and
       Venturi.

       Basically, any rapidly moving fluid, including air  will  "stick" to
       the surface of  a  mass and generate miniature whirlpools which tend
       to slow down the movement of the  air.   If  the mass is to be moved
       through the air  or  fluid,  then  the body of the  mass  should  be
       designed as efficiently as possible to minimize this drag.

       Note that many  of  the airship cases and one in particular show the
       shape of the ship to be a "Mexican cigar" or a cylinder which tapers
       to a point on each end.

       This ship provided  a  most  fascinating  description  of  something
       called a SNAIL-SHELL DEVICE.

             "At each end of the ship is a large steel snail-shell  device,
              which was  the  apparatus  by  which  the strange machine was
              PROPELLED.

              Large gasoline engines caused  whichever  of these are in use
              to REVOLVE RAPIDLY, and to BORE THROUGH THE  AIR, dragging or
              pulling the ship along at a wonderful rate of speed."

             "Two more  of these devices are attached to each side and near
              the end of the ship and ARE USED FOR STEERING."

             "To RAISE THE MACHINE, a like  apparatus  ON  TOP  is  set  in
              motion."
                                      Page 3





       The ship was  described  as being cigar-shaped, about 200 feet long,
       and 50 feet across at the widest  point,  gradually  narrowing  to a
       point at both ends.

       At each end  of the ship was a LARGE STEEL SNAIL-SHELL  DEVICE  that
       was used to propel the strange machine.

       Now anyone who  is  familiar  with  natural  geometry  knows  of the
       Fibonacci and the Golden Ratio (PHI).   The  Fibonacci series begins
       with 1, add another 1 to yield 2, then add the last  two  numbers to
       get the next in the series.

       Thus, 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,...etc..  Examples  of  this series
       occurs in Nature in the form of spirals  of tiny florets in the core
       of daisy blossoms, pine cones, pineapples, seashells,  leaves  and a
       host of other  areas.   These  patterns  occur in both clockwise and
       counter-clockwise flows.

       Once the number 3 is passed in the  Fibonacci series, we come to the
       ratio known as the Golden Ratio.  This is 1:1.618.

       During the early  part  of  the  20th  century,  Victor  Schauberger
       studied the flow  of  water and the motion of fish.  He discovered a
       principle which he termed IMPLOSION.

       Schauberger says that man uses EXPLOSIVE  techniques  in his devices
       which generate heat,  are  inefficient  and destructive  to  Nature.
       IMPLOSION on the  other  hand,  generates  cold, is overly efficient
       (>100%) and is constructive in Nature.

       Now, a spiral  built  on  the  Snail   shell  principle  would  take
       advantage of this  IMPLOSION  for  tremendous  if   not   over-unity
       efficiencies.  Therefore, not  much  energy  would  be  required  to
       operate the engines.

       So here we have an airship built  using  the  AERODYNE principles in
       addition to the IMPLOSION spiral principle.

       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       the Magnetic Airship

       This is another intriguing concept mentioned in the  Wilson  airship
       case.  The wheel  rim  seems  to  be  the  key  to understanding the
       propulsive mechanism of this device.  The description follows:

            "To elevate or depress the ship  while flying through the air a
             small wheel at the stern of the boat is operated.

             This wheel is something like that in a ship's pilot house,
             but instead  of  having  spokes  there was an  arrangement  of
             MAGNETS connected with wires to storage batteries.

             BY PASSING  THE  CURRENT  OVER  THE  TIRE  OF  THE  WHEEL, the
             operator was ABLE TO OVERCOME GRAVITY THUS ELEVATING THE SHIP.

             BY PASSING THE CURRENT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND UNDER THE
             TIRE THE WEIGHT OF THE SHIP  WAS INCREASED and could sink like
             a shot to the earth,


                                      Page 4





             and by passing the currents in OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AT THE SAME
             TIME, the  vessel would remain HORIZONTAL AT ANY DISTANCE FROM
             THE EARTH."

       I believe this  uses  the  principle   of   the  neutral  center  as
       discovered and developed by John W. Keely in the late 1900's.

       Basically, it creates an artificial center of gravity which moves at
       a greater velocity than the natural center of gravity.   By altering
       the physical position  of  the  artificial center in relation to the
       fixed natural center, the ship will  follow  that  movement  in  ANY
       DIRECTION.

       This involves relatively radical concepts which are laced throughout
       KeelyNet.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Vangard note

            What we find most intriguing is that John W. Keely, namesake of
            the KeelyNet BBS, had demonstrated a flying machine  to  the US
            ARMY in  1893.  After the Army turned down Keely's offer of the
            flying machine, little is mentioned  of  what happened to it or
            the research pertaining to it.

            Not to add fuel to any conspiracy but we have  found  something
            disturbing in  regard  to  the book written by Clara Bloomfield
            Moore on  Keely  in the late  1890's.   The  title  is  "Aerial
            Navigation" and  was  intended  to  promote  Keely's   concepts
            PARTICULARLY in  regard  to  the system of flight as evinced by
            the title.

            Through the gracious sharing  of  Mr.  Victor  Hansen,  we were
            allowed to copy THE MISSING CHAPTERS of the  book,  which  were
            INTENTIONALLY REMOVED  from  a  re-issued  version  of the book
            sometime in the very late 1890's  or  early 1900's.  We have no
            idea who  might  have  done  this  but it could  be  reasonably
            assumed that  someone  did  not want Keely's information in the
            public eye.

            Note that only 4 years after  this,  the Airship sightings took
            place with   indications  of  a  secret  group   of   investors
            sponsoring the research and testing as hinted at in some of the
            pilot interviews.

            The information  gleaned from the interviews with the pilots of
            these machines provides very  little  in  the  way of technical
            information although what is offered is most tantalizing.

            Despite the  dated  sighting (1897), the surviving  information
            suggests the existence of at least one group of individuals who
            seem to have kept the technology hidden.

            Perhaps the  UFO  phenomenon is indeed intentional misdirection
            on the part of these individuals  to  keep  investigators  from
            discovering the true source (and technology) relating  to anti-
            gravity and  free  energy.   Of  course, other vested interests
            might also  take actions to suppress  such  technologies  which
            simply add to the problems.

                                      Page 5





            Speculation can   easily   run  rampant  when  confronted  with
            information such as this and  as  shown  in  the most excellent
            book "Genesis"  by  W.  A. Harbinson.  The book  is  definitely
            science fiction yet weaves much of the factual information into
            an amazing story.

            It hints that one of the pilots of the airships giving the name
            Wilson might  have  developed a highly sophisticated and secret
            community which survives even  to this day in the frozen wastes
            of Anti-Antartica.

            Would that Harbinson had information on Keely,  he  could  have
            easily substituted  Keely  for  Wilson  without missing a beat.
            The analogies are striking.   However,  Keely  is  recorded  as
            dying in   1898   although  conversations  with   other   Keely
            researchers speculate on the possibility that he did not die.

            Additional information  listed  on KeelyNet which relate to the
            mystery Airship sightings of 1897 are listed as follows :

            1)  AIRSHIP1 - the missing chapter from Bloomfield Moore's
                           book giving a relatively detailed description of
                           Keely's flying machine
            2)  AIRSHIP2 - a synopsis of  the  1897 sightings including the
                           Keely link
            3)  AIRSHIP3  - a description of Keely's demonstration  of  his
                           flying machine to the US ARMY in 1893
            4)  AIR1GIF   -  two  scanned  versions of Keely's airship, the
                           first is a copy of the original picture given to
                           us by Victor  Hansen,  the  second  is a graphic
                           version of the same picture
