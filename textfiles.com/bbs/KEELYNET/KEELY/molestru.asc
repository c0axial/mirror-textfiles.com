                      On the Structure of the Molecule

       Each molecule has three envelopes.  The most external one may be
    illustrated by an india-rubber ball on which are traced a number of
    meridian lines.

       On another ball, three envelopes are represented.  The outer
    hemisphere of one of the envelopes is removed to show the under
    envelope, the outer  hemisphere  of  which  is removed in still another
    part of the diagram to show the inmost envelope.

       A third diagram shows the position of the atoms which the rotating
    envelopes enclose.

       A fourth diagram shows the lines of interference of the rotating
    envelopes.  There being three perfect  envelopes,  these  of  necessity
    must have six  poles,  to which add the neutral centre  of  the  sphere
    itself, comprising the  origin  of the septenary (7) of mysticism which
    is universal in nature.

       The fifth diagram shows the subdivision of matter into atomic,
    atomolic, and atomolinic.  A black disc representing a sphere shows the
    negative atom; two white discs also  representing  spheres,  illustrate
    the two positive   atoms   in  the  triad,  completing   the   tertiary
    aggregation forming the molecule.

       Each atom  is  in  turn  composed of three atomoles; in the negative
    atom are three positive atomoles, positive in the sense of activity; in
    the positive atom are also three atomoles,  two  of which are negative,
    i.e.  passive, and one positive.

       The negative is always that which seeks the neutral centre; for
    instance, the sun is a medium for transmitting radiant energy of
    positive order, which all the planets receive negatively, i.e. it
    focalizes upon their neutral centres.  This order extends to infinity.

       The final diagram presented was simply intended to further elucidate
    the action of  the  rotating  envelopes, illustrating  the  compressing
    force of the rotating spheral and the protection of the neutral poles.

       In the  rotating  envelopes  force acts in the opposite direction to
    its action in the revolution of the earth, where the centrifugal action
    is greatest at the equator; and the greater the speed of rotation, the
    greater the centre-fleeing force.

       In the case of the etheric envelope, however, the greater the speed
    of rotation, the  more  powerful is  the  centripetal  (centre-seeking)
    force which compresses  the atoms within; the pressure,  therefore,  is
    greatest at the equator and gradually lessens toward the poles.

       If there were only one envelope, the tendency would be for the atoms
    to be oblate, to fly out at the poles, where the pressure is least.

       A beautiful provision of nature obviates this, by providing three
    envelopes, rotating one  within  the other, like three shells; the line
    of greatest internal pressure in each  one  of which being protected by
    the equatorial lines, the line of greatest pressure  covering  the line
    of least pressure on the others.  Each of the three atoms is placed
    directly under one pole of each of the three envelopes.

       If the rotating envelope of the molecule were in any way checked in
    its motion, the   enclosed   matter   would  immediately  burst  forth,
    producing the phenomenon of integration,  releasing from its previously
    pent-up condition a volume of matter many times as great as that before
    disintegration took place.

       Sound-force moving  at  certain  rates  of vibration  negatizes  the
    action of the  rotating envelopes, producing conditions which result in
    their breaking up, followed by the separation of the atoms contained in
    those envelopes, and also of inter-molecular  substance occupying space
    not taken up by the atoms.

       By successive orders of vibration the atoms, atomoles, and atomolini
    are disintegrated, and so on to the luminous order, where all control
    ceases.

       The human brain being formed of an inestimable number of spherical
    resonators, termed in medical science NERVE CELLS, forming the gray
    matter of the brain, these minute spheres take up the THOUGHT FORCE
    which permeates all space in endless waves, eternally active.

       This force we term ATOMOLIC; the cells are composed of ATOMOLES,
    whose vibratory motions under the action of universal THOUGHT FORCE
    result in the phenomena of thought, cognition, intellection, etc.
    Understanding this, no one should continue to feel surprise at the
    varying emotions and impulses of a human being in an undeveloped state,
    as only by developed WILL can the motions of this force be directed.

       The entire human economy, in the action of all its functions,
    assimilations, and motions, is the result of differentiation of this
    unitary force, all tending to supply the instrument connecting the
    organism with this force (the brain) with certain gases whereby it
    sustains its ceaseless action from birth to death: these gases supply
    the rotating envelopes with necessary substance for their continued
    activity.  Were this supply cut off, death would immediately ensue; it
    is a fact well demonstrated that the resonating brain-structure is the
    first to undergo decomposition.

       In all embodied conditions of the manifested universe, the law of
    harmony reigns supreme; the cause of this manifestation  is  the result
    of the positive being stronger than the negative; the positive is
    everywhere the dominant   order   of  the  universe;  this  reality  is
    perfectly embodied in the word I AM;  it is the reason why annihilation
    is both inconceivable and impossible in the universe.

       The truth of this statement can be experimentally demonstrated; its
    law is found in all threefold aggregations, and there is a UNIVERSAL
    trinity composed of two positives and one negative.

       Eternal consciousness,  immortal  life,  and  an infinite  order  of
    beings
                                     Page 2







    is the result, whilst every provision is made in the order of creation
    for the happiness and enjoyment of all manifested beings.  Conditions
    are also provided whereby satiety falls to the lot of none.

       The eternally  conscious entity - call it by whatever name we please
    - moves in cycles as eternal and infinite as itself; it oscillates and
    vibrates perpetually and is never unconscious of any present condition,
    be it pain  or  pleasure,  joy or sorrow,  shame  or  glory;  like  the
    pendulum of a clock or the sun, moon, or tides, it swings  from the one
    to the other  of these conditions, now in pleasure, now in pain, by its
    contact with the extremes of all varying conditions, like a child which
    throws up its head and laughing for joy exclaims, I KNOW I AM.
