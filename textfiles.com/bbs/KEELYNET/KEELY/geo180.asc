This is a simple question that was asked to me by a scientist working on a
problem dealing with geology. I gave a quick answer but thought it might be
fun to see what other would say.

"If two waves, sound or EM are combined out of phase with a net sum of 0, what
 happens to the energy in the waves?"

That was asked here not too long ago.  The only way that two waves could add
up to zero everywhere would be if their sources were coincident.  In that
case, for coincident out-of-phase sources, the energy is zero to begin with.
(Think of one-dimensional acoustic waves in a tube with a piston at the end.
Or a piston at either end.  Zero sum means zero pressure on the piston(s),
hence zero work.)

Local cancellation increases the energy elsewhere.  Think of a lens coating,
where the reflection from the coating is out of phase with the reflection from
the lens itself.  The net reflection is reduced, hence increasing the light
transmitted through the lens.

Arthur C. Clarke wrote a delightful short story (forget the title, but I
believe it's in his "Tales From the White Hart" collection) about the
consequences of sound cancellation where the net energy was not all preserved
as sound.

 What about 2 pulses one the inversion duringf overlap the energy is
 is diminsihing to zero (perfect overlap) and then increases again. So where
 does the energy go during this period?

The energy is reflected to be elsewhere.  For istance, it could be sent back
from whence it came.  Just in front of a mirror, the energy flow is the same
away from and towards the mirror.  In the case of standing waves, where the
pressure is zero (from opposite pressure waves cancelling), the velocity is
at is maximum; a transformation from potential energy to kinetic energy.

So that the "cancellation" is only in one (of many possible) energy form.

Actually, the median over 1 cycle is 0.  The heating power (RMS) is (0.7071 x
peak)^2/R.  If that weren't true then we'd have no need for all those power
transmission lines.

Boy, this comes up a lot.

You cannot get perfect cancellation *everywhere* of two waves unless
the sources are identical in directivity and content, 180 degrees
out of phase and superimposed in space. The last condition is the
key. If these otherwise perfectly cancelling sources are not in the
same location, then there will be regions of cancellation and regions
of reinforcement. If you integrate the energy density over the
entire field then the result will be just twice what it would be
if only one of the sources were radiating. Energy density, however,
will be "lumpy," varying from point to point throughout the field.

So can we actually superimpose the sources in space? Well, how do
you do that? Suppose we're talking about sound and you want to put
two speakers in exactly the same location. Since you can't physically
do that, you choose the next best thing and drive one speaker with
two perfectly cancelling electrical signals. Net result? The speaker
cone does not move!

But now at least we can see what happens to the energy. The amplifiers
generating the two perfectly cancelling signals are forced to absorb
it, turning it into heat.

Well, that's a lot of hand-waving. If you want to direct your
scientist (?) to a good introduction to this subject, refer him to
"Active Noise Control," in IEEE Signal Processing Magazine,
October, 1993.
