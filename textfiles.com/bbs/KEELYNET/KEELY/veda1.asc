                       Mantras, Mandalas, the Krell Helmet
                                 and John Keely

                          by Jerry W. Decker, Director
                                Vangard Sciences

    The Vedas contain  many  references to machines and devices which appear
    to use certain types of fire.  This fire is said to consist of any of 49
    different varieties which include sound,  electricity,  magnetism,  heat
    and other types which modern man has yet to re-discover.

    For some mysterious reason, I have always been attracted  to these Vedic
    stories, possibly due  to  a  consuming  interest in the work of John W.
    Keely stemming from the late 60's.  Sounds, indeed all frequencies, have
    properties which formal science has yet to uncover.

    The Vedas speak of flying machines,  referred  to as Vimanas, which were
    purported to use the power of sound for the production of levitation and
    thrust.

    On a recent  (May  89)  visit to the local Hare Krisna  temple  here  in
    Dallas with two  visiting  friends,  one from England and the other from
    Maine, we met an interesting young devotee.

    This man was conversant in Sanskrit  and  was  able  to read the ancient
    Vedic documents.  On  discovering this, one of our party  inquired  what
    the young man knew of the ancient technologies of which the Vedas speak,
    including Vimanas.

    The young man  proceeded  to  tell  us of the Disc of Rama, known as the
    Sudarshan Disc.  It seems that periodically  the  world becomes infested
    with men who  have  lost  their direction towards unification  with  the
    Godhood.

    When this occurs,  and the numbers of these men are such that they begin
    to drag down the rest of struggling  humanity,  Rama was said to release
    the Sudarshan Disc.

    The Disc went forth to seek out these "miscreants" who have forsaken the
    path, to bring  about their destruction.  On the successful  destruction
    of such people,  the  Disc  returned  to  Rama to await its next call to
    action.

    Apparently the Sudarshan Disc was  capable  of  some  type  of signature
    analysis in that  waveforms and/or frequencies associated  with  certain
    modes of thought  or  behavior  would  cause  the weapon to seek out and
    destroy the offending target.

    There is a story which we have been  unable  to  verify  which says that
    Tesla had come  up  with some type of weapon or technology  which  would
    vaporize any item  which  might  be  picked  up  with the intent to harm
    another.

    Mr. Tesla was alleged to have presented  this  idea  to  Congress  in an
    attempt to acquire funding for a weapon which would obviate  all wars or
    hostile actions on the planet.

    This device also  must have been capable of detecting certain "orders of
    vibration - Keely" which would be associated  with  such  behavior.   Of
    course, the offer was turned down.

    The devotee told us that modern man was wasteful and  negligent  in  the
    dispensation of his  weapons of war and destruction when compared to the
    abilities of the masters of Vedic technologies.

    Modern weapons are sent forth without  regard  for  innocent  people who
    have nothing to do with the anger which brought about the problem in the
    first place.  As   a  result,  many  innocent  people   are   needlessly
    destroyed.

    The Vedas speak  of a technology which provided for specific and precise
    direction of those destructive energies towards a singular target.

    As an example, the young devotee spoke  of the "Fire Arrow".  This was a
    specific mandala (a   two-dimensional   representation   of   a   three-
    dimensional form) which  could be mentally projected in conjunction with
    the mantra/yantra (the vocalization  of  the pattern encoded in the two-
    dimensional mandala).

    The use of  the Fire Arrow was to project an all-consuming  fire  toward
    the object of your anger.

    It was done  by  mentally  imaging  the  pattern  of  the  mandala which
    represented the Fire.  When the pattern  was  fixed  in  the  mind,  the
    sender was to physically carry out the action of firing  an  arrow using
    an imaginary bow and arrow.

    As the string  on  the imaginary bow was released, the sender would WILL
    the Fire Arrow Mandala to be sent toward  the  target as if riding on an
    invisible arrow.  He  must then visualize the Mandala actually  striking
    and consuming the target.

    At the same  time,  the vocalization of the Fire Arrow Mantra would also
    be directed at the target.  This would  effectively energize the mandala
    pattern, much like charging a capacitor or an inductor,  to  provide  it
    with the energy required to unspin from a two-dimensional image into its
    time dependent three-dimensional image and thus consume the target.

    When this process was carried out with a directed WILL, the target would
    be completely consumed.   Nothing which was not included in the original
    target would be damaged.  Thus, due to its specificity, the Vedic system
    was much to be preferred.

    In one of the more exotic stories  about  Keely,  he  is  said  to  have
    developed a belt which somehow allowed him to focus his  WILL and direct
    it to achieve a decrease or an increase in gravity as desired.

    The text of  this miraculous experiment can be found in Chapter 3 of Dan
    A. Davidson's book "A Breakthrough to New Free Energy Sources".  Dan has
    graciously allowed Vangard  to provide  this  chapter  on  the  KeelyNet
    computer BBS at (214) 324-3501 and listed as DANART1.ZIP or DANART1.ASC.

    An interesting correlate  to the Keely story is one from  a  friend  who
    tells of an  engineer  acquaintance  of  his friend who, inspired by the
    movie "The Forbidden Planet" decided to build the Krell Helmet.


                                     Page 2





    The movie is  based  on  the discovery of the Krell civilization, a race
    intellectually far in advance of mankind.  The Krell Helmet was a device
    which was used  to  assist  in  the   development   of   the  powers  of
    concentration and mentation in Krell children.  It consisted of contacts
    which were touched to the head which somehow "pumped" the brain.

    This engineer decided that in reality, the brain could  in  fact somehow
    be "pumped" to  allow  the expansion of consciousness into the other 94%
    of the brain in stages proportionate to the power level used.

    Under the influence of this pumping field, the brain would be stimulated
    much like a  tuning fork.  Mental abilities  including  IQ  and  special
    "powers" involve the  saturation  of  given areas of the  brain  with  a
    profusion of synapses.   Oxidation  of the brain would also occur due to
    hydrolysis and an increased blood flow induced by the stimulation of the
    electrical potentials of the cells.

    This pumped energy field would bring  about  a concentration of synapses
    which would serve as multiple parallel conduits.  These  would  then not
    only allow for  enhanced pattern recognition but also serve to stimulate
    the development of  sensory  abilities   normally  associated  with  the
    synergistic manifestation of so-called "paranormal abilities."

    The engineer our  friend  spoke  of  is  alleged to have  the  following
    abilities when under the influence of this Krell Helmet :

       1)  by  concentrating  on  the  face  of anyone on the planet, he can
           mentally project his mind into  the  mind  of his subject to read
           any thought or evoke any memory which the subject has stored

       2)  using  a  similar  technique as above, the operator  can  project
           thoughts or  patterns of action into the mind of the subject with
           the subject thinking them to be his own

       3)  "cerebellic fields - Keely" can  be  so extended that mass can be
           brought under   control   for   practical   manipulation.    This
           manipulation can   take   the   form  of  genetic  transmutation,
           levitation or  any  of  a host  of  other-at  this  time  unknown
           possibilities.

    The technique involves the use of a radio transmitter  with  a frequency
    range into the high megahertz.

    According to the  work  of  Bentov,  the body has 5 distinct vibrational
    patterns.  One of these vibrational  patterns is that of the brain which
    has an electrical  oscillation  in  the area of 488 MHZ.   There  is  an
    account of a   CIA  device  which  takes  advantage  of  this  frequency
    phenomenon to kill  a  specific  target   through  cancellation  of  the
    electrical field of the brain.

    The CIA device  is  simply  inserted  into  the  earpiece  of  a  normal
    telephone.  When the  victim  answers the phone and correctly identifies
    himself, the device samples his current brain frequency, runs the signal
    through a unity gain amplifier, re-transmits  at  the same frequency and
    amplitude but with the signal shifted by 180 degrees.   This  creates  a
    standing wave which  cancels the electrical field of the target brain to
    cause instantaneous death.



                                     Page 3





    Anyone "skilled in  the  art" can duplicate this effect if provided with
    the proper equipment and is very careful  with  the amplitudes used.  It
    takes advantage of  basic  principles  of  frequency   propagation   and
    manipulation.

    The Krell Helmet  and  the  Keely  Belt  both  undoubtedly  use the same
    phenomenon yet control the signal through  phase locking.  Therefore, to
    prevent phase shifting   beyond   a   certain  acceptable   limit,   the
    fundamental frequency must  be  tracked  with  an  accuracy  approaching
    something on the order of 0 to possibly 90 degrees of the fundamental.

    The degree of phase shifting determines  whether  the  device  stuns  or
    kills while the amplitude determines the severity (or  finality)  of the
    effect.

    This opens up   startling   possibilities  for  weapons,  anti-terrorist
    devices, stunners for policeman and citizens, anaesthesia devices, sleep
    inducing devices, etc.  In a word, STAR TREK LIVES!

    Perhaps this is the technique used  to  carry  out the "telepathic sleep
    jobs" as mentioned in the book ALTERNATIVE THREE!  If  the  Russians are
    as advanced in PSI research as many believe, this is most certainly
    a technology they  would not overlook as would any government interested
    in covert activities.

    For those of us with a metaphysical  background,  we  find  in the Krell
    Helmet many parallels  with  the Siddhis, which were the  occult  powers
    attained at certain levels of Yogic development.

    A Yogi who had mastered these occult powers could :

       1)  plunge into the Earth as if it were mere water
       2)  enter a stone if he wishes
       3)  so influence water as to not wet him
       4)  control fire so that it does not burn him
       5)  make himself invisible
       6)  have knowledge of the past, present and future
       7)  have knowledge of all sounds of all living beings
       8)  have knowledge of other's minds
       9)  have knowledge of the time of one's own death
      10)  have  knowledge  of  terrestrial  or extra-terrestrial systems or
           events
      11)  possess the ability to go through space without harm
      12)  master hunger, thirst and bodily functions
      13)  master the senses
      14)  master the elements
      15)  make himself infinitely small or large
      16)  make  himself  extremely  dense   or   extremely   light  thereby
           controlling gravity and mass

    The full extent and nature of all the Siddhi powers are not made clear.

    One is warned again and again, that these powers are  obstacles  on  the
    road to the  highest state and should not be sought for their own sakes.
    They are incidental and may give the  student of Yoga a false confidence
    which provides little assistance toward the student's goal.

    In regard to  the viewpoint that Keely used EXCLUSIVELY MENTAL POWERS to
    operate his equipment, we of VANGARD  do  not  share  this view.  In the
    very beginning, the original device which preceeded his  compound  sonic
    investigations was based  on  thermodynamic  principles,  i.e.   it took
    advantage temperature differentials    by   using   specific   geometric
    arrangements of purely mechanical components.

    Only in Keely's  later  researches  did he come to understand  the  mind
    flows and how  they could be related and coupled to the principle of the
    trinity as manifest in Nature.

    Because of this somewhat limited view,  we feel many will not succeed in
    duplicating Keelys' work.   As  can  be  seen,  one  must   develop   an
    extraordinary will with  the  ability to sustain a thought or desire for
    prolonged periods as shown by the years of dedication to which a student
    of Yoga commits himself.

    This is especially true when attempting  to  consciously  manipulate the
    triple flows of force of which all matter and energy are comprised.

    By taking a mechanistic approach from the beginning we should eventually
    be able to  duplicate  the compound frequency researches  which  led  to
    practical devices for Keely.

    VANGARD takes the  approach that machines are simply tools that may also
    be used to assist in personal development through the use of biofeedback
    techniques.  In order  to  learn   to   duplicate   an  effect  such  as
    Alpha/Theta control, you must first learn how to get to that level, what
    it feels like when there and how to successfully return.   Once this has
    been accomplished and  performed  a  number  of  times, rote memory will
    allow us to discard the equipment.

    As confirmation of  this  attitude,   it  just so happens  that  we were
    recently informed that  the  engineer  in possession of the Krell Helmet
    can now perform  SOME FUNCTIONS WITHOUT  THE  USE  OF  THE  HELMET!  Of
    course, this is  after  years  of  use  which  has allowed  his  "mental
    muscles" to develop beyond the ordinary.

    Is it possible  Keely developed to this level?  How about the story told
    by Dan Davidson regarding the appearance  of  Keely  behind  locked  and
    guarded doors at the Pentagon?

    The story loosely says that military scientists were investigating sound
    waves and their  effects  on matter.  On achieving a certain  "order  of
    vibration - Keely"  the  laboratory  where  the  experiment was held was
    destroyed.

    A hurried super-secret conference was  set up at the Pentagon to discuss
    the possibilities of  this fantastic "new" weapon and  was  held  behind
    closed and formidably guarded doors.

    As the brass  were  licking  their  chops  over the devastation this new
    force could produce, a man mysteriously  materialized  in  the center of
    the room.

    The startled generals were told :

            "WE WILL  NOT  ALLOW  YOU  TO USE THESE PRINCIPLES TO DO HARM TO
             OTHERS.  You are like children  with  nuclear  toys and have no
             concept of  what  destruction  you  could produce.   You  could
             easily destroy your planet as well as your solar system."

            "If you  think  I know not of what I speak," as he drew a myriad
             of equations on a chalkboard,  "take  these  formulations  into
             your lab and test them.  You will see the powers which might be
             unleashed if you are allowed to continue."

            "Be forewarned, WE ARE AWARE OF YOUR ACTIONS  AND  WILL  PREVENT
             THE USE OF THIS FORCE FOR DESTRUCTION!"

    Finally, one of the generals meekly asked, "Who are YOU?"

    The mysterious man replied simply, "I AM JOHN ERNST WORRELL KEELY!", and
    vanished from their sight.

    Badly shaken, the generals adjourned the meeting.

    If there is  even  one  grain of truth to this story, we might indeed be
    watched and our actions (with their  future  consequences)  monitored by
    superior intellects.  Perhaps  Keely  advanced  to that  stage  and  was
    invited to join such an august body.  Who knows??

    Due to the  nature  of  this  paper,  we  debated  the  release  of this
    information and decided that it must  be openly and freely shared.  This
    is what VANGARD and KeelyNet are all about, as is Borderland.

    We of Vangard Sciences, working in conjunction with Dale  Pond  of Delta
    Spectrum, have been  spreading the word on Keely as well as collecting a
    body of related  information.   Dale   publishes  the  Keely  newsletter
    (Journal of Sympathetic  Vibrational  Physics) and offers  an  extensive
    catalog while Vangard sponsors the KeelyNet computer BBS at no charge to
    its users.  Vangard also publishes the Plenum newsletter.

    KeelyNet offers text  files  which  cover free energy, biology, ecology,
    UFO's and most especially Keely.   We  run  up  to  2400  Baud  on an XT
