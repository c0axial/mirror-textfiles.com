    "I know medicine  is called science.  It is nothing like a science.  It
    is a great  humbug!  Doctors are mere  empirics  (people  who  rely  on
    experience or experiment)  when  they are not charlatans.   We  are  as
    ignorant as men  can  be.   Who  knows  anything  in  the  world  about
    medicine?  Gentlemen, you have done  me  the  honour  to  come  here to
    attend my lectures, and I must tell you now, frankly, in the beginning,
    that I know nothing about medicine, nor do I know anyone  who does know
    anything about it.   Nature does a great deal, imagination does a great
    deal, doctors do devilish little when they do not do harm.  Sick people
    always feel they are neglected, unless  they  are  well  drugged,  les'
    imbeciles!"
                                          Professor Magendie
                                  (before the students of his class in
                                   "The Allopathic College of Paris")

    In the year  1871, the writer (Clara Bloomfield Moore)  was  sent  from
    Paris to Schwalbach,  by  Dr.   Beylard, and recommended to the care of
    Adolph Genth.  She said to the physician,  "I wish for your opinion and
    your advice, if you can give it to me without giving me any medicine."

    He replied, "With  all my heart, madam; and I wish to  God  there  were
    more women like you, but we should soon lose most of our patients if we
    did not dose them."

    This is a  terrible excuse for the use of those agencies which Dr. John
    Good says have  sent  more  human beings  to  their  graves  than  war,
    pestilence and famine combined.

    Keely holds the  opinion  that  Nature  works  under  the  one  law  of
    Compensation and Equilibrium  -  the  law  of  Harmony;  and  that when
    disease indicates the disturbance of  this  law Nature at once seeks to
    banish the disease  by  RESTORING  equilibrium,  He   seeks  to  render
    assistance on the same plan; replacing grossly material agencies by the
    finer forces of  nature;  as has been successfully done by Dr. Pancoast
    and Dr. Babbitt in America.

    "Nature," says Dr. Pancoast, author  of  "The  True  Science of Light",
    "WORKS BY ANTAGONISM  IN  ALL  HER  OPERATIONS;  when  one  her  forces
    OVERDOES its work,  DISEASE,  or  at  least  a  local  disorder, is the
    IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE; now, if we attack  this  force  and overcome it,
    the OPPOSITE FORCE HAS A CLEAR FIELD and may REASSERT  its rights -thus
    EQUILIBRIUM is restored, and EQUILIBRIUM IS HEALTH.



                                     Page 1





    The Sympathetic Stream,  INSTEAD OF ATTACKING THE STRONGER FORCE, SENDS
    RECRUITS TO THE WEAKER ONE, and enables  it  to RECOVER ITS POWERS; or,
    if the disorder  be  the  result  of  EXCESSIVE TENSION  of  Nerves  or
    Ganglia, a negative  remedy  may  be  employed  to  reduce the tension.
    Thus, too, equilibrium is restored."

    Dr. Hartmann writes : "Mr. Keely is perfectly right in saying that "all
    disease is a  disturbance  of  the  equilibrium  between  positive  and
    negative forces."  In  my  opinion, no doctor EVER CURED  ANY  DISEASE.
    All he can  possibly  do  is  to  establish  conditions under which the
    patient (or nature) may cure himself.

    If you enter the field of therapeutics  and medicine, we find a decided
    fermentation of new   ideas;   not  among  the  fossil   specimens   of
    antediluvian quackery, but  among  those  who  are called "irregulars,"
    because they have the courage to DEPART  FROM THE TRACKS TRODDEN out by
    their predecessors.

    The more intelligent classes of physicians have long  ago  realized the
    fact THAT DRUGS AND MEDICINES ARE PERFECTLY USELESS, excepting in cases
    where diseases can  be  traced  to some MECHANICAL OBSTRUCTION, in some
    organ that may be reached by mechanical action.

    In all other cases our best physicians  have  become agnostics, leaving
    nature to have her own way, and observing the expectative method, which
    in fact, is no method of care at all, but merely consists  in  DOING NO
    HARM TO THE PATIENT.

    Recently, however, light,   electricity,   and   magnetism   have  been
    employed; so that even in the medical guild the finer forces are taking
    the place of grossly material, and therefore injurious substances.

    The time is probably near when these  finer  forces  will  be  employed
    universally.  Everybody knows  that  a note struck upon  an  instrument
    will produce sound  in  a  correspondingly  attuned  instrument  in its
    vicinity.

    If connected with a tuning fork, it  will produce a corresponding sound
    in the latter; and IF CONNECTED WITH A THOUSAND SUCH  TUNING  FORKS, IT
    WILL MAKE ALL  THE THOUSAND SOUND, AND PRODUCE A NOISE FAR GREATER THAN
    THE ORIGINAL SOUND, WITHOUT THE LATTER BECOMING ANY WEAKER FOR IT.

    Here, then, is the AUGMENTATION OR MULTIPLICATION  OF POWER.  If we had
    any means to  TRANSFORM SOUND again into MECHANICAL  MOTION,  we  would
    have a THOUSANDFOLD MULTIPLICATION OF MECHANICAL MOTION.

        ---->>> Vangard Note
        This is apparently a pumping of the neutral centres of the mass
        to cause a release of the now current ZERO POINT ENERGY. ----<<<

    It would be  presumptuous  to  say  that it will not be as easy for the
    scientists of the future to transform  sound into mechanical motion, as
    it is for  the  scientist  of  the  present  to  transform   heat  into
    electricity.

    Perhaps Mr. Keely  has  already  solved  the  problem.  There is a fair
    prospect that in the very near future,  we  shall have, in his ethereal
    force, a power far surpassing that of steam or electricity.

                                     Page 2






    Nor does the idea seem to be Utopian if we remember that modern science
    heretofore only knew  the  law  of the conservation of energy; while to
    the scientist of the future the law  of the AUGMENTATION OF ENERGY will
    be unveiled.

    As the age which has passed away has been the age of steam,  the coming
    era will be  the age of induction.  There will be a universal rising up
    of LOWER VIBRATIONS INTO HIGHER VIBRATIONS, in the realm of motion.

    Mr. Keely will, perhaps, TRANSFORM  SOUND  INTO  MECHANICAL  MOTION  by
    applying the LAW OF AUGMENTATION AND MULTIPLICATION OF FORCE."

    Keely, writing on brain disturbance, says,

         "In considering the mental forces as associated with the physical,
          I find, by my past researches, that the convolutions  which exist
          in the  cerebral  field  are ENTIRELY GOVERNED by the sympathetic
          conditions that surround them."

          The question arises, what are these aggregations and what do they
          represent, as being linked with physical impulses?

          They (convolutions  of  the   brain)   are   SIMPLY   VIBROMETRIC
          RESONATORS, thoroughly   SUBSERVIENT   TO  SYMPATHETIC   ACOUSTIC
          IMPULSES given  to  them  by their atomic sympathetic SURROUNDING
          MEDIA, all the sympathetic impulses  that  so entirely govern the
          physical in  their  many  and  perfect  impulses   (we   are  now
          discussing PURITY  OF  CONDITIONS)  are  NOT  EMANATIONS properly
          INHERENT IN THEIR OWN COMPOSITION.

          They are ONLY MEDIA - THE ACOUSTIC  MEDIA - for TRANSFERRING from
          their vibratory surroundings the CONDITIONS NECESSARY to the pure
          connective link  for  VITALIZING  AND BRINGING  INTO  ACTION  THE
          VARIED IMPULSES OF THE PHYSICAL.

        ---->>> Vangard Note
            The above  two  paragraphs  indicate  the  control of mind over
            matter through  the expansion  and  conscious  control  of  the
            cerebellic or cerebral field.  ----<<<

          All ABNORMAL   DISCORDANT   AGGREGATIONS   in  these   resonating
          convolutions PRODUCE  DIFFERENTIATION to CONCORDANT TRANSMISSION;
          and, according AS THESE DIFFERENTIATIONS  EXIST  IN VOLUME so the
          transmissions are DISCORDANTLY TRANSFERRED, PRODUCING  ANTAGONISM
          TO PURE PHYSICAL ACTION.

          Thus, in  motor  ataxy,  a differentiation of the MINOR THIRDS of
          the posterior parietal lobule produces the same condition between
          the retractors and exteriors  of  the  leg and foot, and thus the
          CONTROL OF   THE   PROPER   MOVEMENTS   IS  LOST   THROUGH   THIS
          DIFFERENTIATION.

          The same  truth can be universally applied to any of the cerebral
          convolutions that are in a state  of  differential harmony to the
          mass of immediate cerebral surroundings.

          Taking the cerebral condition of the whole mass  as  one,  it  is
          SUBSERVIENT TO  ONE  HEAD  CENTRE;  although AS MANY NEUTRALS ARE
          REPRESENTED AS THERE ARE CONVOLUTIONS.

        ---->>> Vangard Note
            Here we  see the very advanced understanding of Keely in regard
            to the combination or synthesis  of  forces (or frequencies) to
            reduce or  compound  into  fewer and fewer controlling  neutral
            centres.  Eventually  we  get  to the "chord mass" (i.e. two or
            more frequencies harmonically  or  enharmonically  related) and
            then TO THE SINGLE CONTROLLING NEUTRAL CENTRE. <<<---

          The introductory minors are controlled by the molecular; the next
          progressive third  by  the  atomic;  and the high  third  by  the
          etheric.

          All these  progressive  links  have their positive, negative, and
          neutral position.

          When we take into consideration  the  structural condition of the
          human brain,  we  ought  not  to be bewildered  by  the  infinite
          variety of  its  sympathetic  impulses, inasmuch as it unerringly
          proves the  true  philosophy   that   the   mass-chords  of  such
          structures are governed by vibratory etheric flows.

          There is NO STRUCTURE WHATEVER - animal, vegetable,  or mineral -
          that is not built up from the cosmic ether.

          CERTAIN ORDERS  OF ATTRACTIVE VIBRATION PRODUCE CERTAIN ORDERS OF
          STRUCTURE; thus the infinite variety  of effects; more especially
          in the cerebral organs.

            The work done by Ernst Chladni, Dr. Hans Jenny  and  Dr.  Peter
            Guy Manners  in  the  work  of  vibrating  waveplates  known as
            CHLADNI WAVEPLATES directly demonstrates the truth of how SOUND
            RULES THE PHYSICAL.  When applied to a three dimensional model,
            the most amazing patterns  are  formed,  highly  geometric  and
            showing the multiplicity of pattern in Nature.   Refer  to  the
            file CHLADNI.ASC on the KeelyNet for a short biography. ----<<<

          The bar  of  iron  or  the  mass of steel, have, in each, all the
          qualifications necessary, under  certain  vibratory  impulses, to
          evolve all the conditions that govern that animal  organism - the
          brain :  and  it  is  as  possible TO DIFFERENTIATE THE MOLECULAR
          CONDITIONS of a mass of metal  of any shape so as to produce what
          you may  express  as a CRAZY PIECE OF IRON OR A  CRAZY  PIECE  OF
          STEEL ; or, vice versa, AN INTELLIGENT CONDITION IN THE SAME.

        ---->>> Vangard Note
            Metals have  a  crystalline  structure.   The  American Indians
            believe crystal structures possess  life and intelligence.  The
            age of  the  crystal  denotes the wisdom of  the  entity.   The
            Bloodstone used  for  the stem of all true peace pipes is taken
            from a single large stone located  in only one area of the U.S.
            Jerry Gallimore  says that persons ritually smoking  the  peace
            pipe cannot  lie,  or  the  peace  pipe  will  strike them down
            through the power of the mother  stone,  no matter the physical
            distance.  ----<<<

          I find in my researches, as to the condition of  molecules  under
          vibration, that  DISCORDANCE CANNOT EXIST IN THE MOLECULE PROPER;
          and that it is the highest and most perfect structural condition

                                     Page 4





          that exists; PROVIDING all the progressive orders ARE THE SAME.

          Discordance in  any  mass  is the RESULT OF DIFFERENTIATED GROUPS
          INDUCED BY *** ANTAGONISTIC CHORDS  ***, and the flight or motion
          of such, when intensified by sound, are very tortuous and zigzag;
          but when free of this differentiation are in STRAIGHT LINES.

          TORTUOUS LINES  DENOTE  DISCORD, OR PAIN; STRAIGHT  LINES  DENOTE
          HARMONY, OR PLEASURE.

        ---->>> Vangard Note
            The above  two  paragraphs  are CRITICAL TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF
            HOW KEELY ACHIEVED HIS RESULTS!   We can see how the removal of
            the mass  differentiations  would  yield  straight   lines,  in
            today's terminology  we  would  call this SUPERCONDUCTING since
            all points take the SHORTEST POSSIBLE PATH to get from one area
            to another.  Therefore, it could be said that Superconductivity
            combined with RESONANCE equals SYMPATHY. <<<---

          Any differentiated mass can be  brought to a condition of harmony
          or equation  by  proper  chord  media,  and  an equated  sympathy
          produced.

          There is  good  reason  for  believing  that INSANITY IS SIMPLY A
          DIFFERENTIATION IN THE MASS-CHORDS  OF THE CEREBRAL CONVOLUTIONS,
          which CREATES AN ANTAGONISTIC MOLECULAR BOMBARDMENT  towards  the
          neutral or  attractive  centres  of  such convolutions; which, in
          turn, produce a morbid irritation in the cortical sensory centres
          in the substance of ideation; accompanied, as a general thing, by
          sensory hallucinations, ushered in by subjective sensations; such
          as flashes  of  light  and  colour,   or   confused   sounds  and
          disagreeable odours, etc., etc.

          There is no condition of the human brain that  ought  not  to  be
          SYMPATHETICALLY COINCIDENT  to that order of atomic flow to which
          its position, IN THE CEREBRAL FIELD, is fitted.

          Any differentiation in that special  organ  (the brain), or, more
          plainly, any  discordant grouping tends to produce  a  discordant
          bombardment -  an  ANTAGONISTIC  CONFLICT;  which  means the same
          disturbance (will  be) transferred  to  the  physical,  PRODUCING
          ENHARMONIOUS DISASTER  to  that  portion  of the  physical  field
          (section of  the  body)  which  is  controlled  by  that especial
          convolution.

          This unsuitable aggregation may be COMPARED TO A KNOT ON A VIOLIN
          STRING.  As  long  as this knot  remains,  it  is  impossible  to
          elicit, from  its sympathetic surroundings, the  condition  which
          transfers pure concordance to its resonating body.

          Discordant conditions  (i.e.  differentiation  of  or  knots in a
          mass) produce negatization (interference  of intended actions) to
          coincident action.

    The question now arises, "What condition is it necessary to bring about
    in order to bring back normality, or to produce stable  equilibrium  in
    the sympathetic centres?".

          The normal brain is like a harp of many strings strung to perfect

                                     Page 5





          harmony.  The  transmitting  conditions being perfect, are ready,
          at any impulse, to induce pure sympathetic assimilation.

          The different  strings represent  the  different  ventricles  and
          convolutions.

          The differentiations of any one from its true  setting  is FATAL,
          TO A CERTAIN DEGREE (dependent on the degree of phase shift),
          to the harmony of the whole combination.

        ---->>> Vangard Note
            The above  Keely  statement ties in directly with the VEDA1.ASC
            article on the KeelyNet warning  of  phase imbalances which can
            numb or electrically cancel the brain energies.  <<<---

          If the sympathetic condition of any physical organism  carries  a
          positive flow  of  80  per  cent, on its whole combination, and a
          negative one  of  20  per cent,  it  is  the  medium  of  perfect
          assimilation to one of the same ratio, if it is distributed under
          the same conditions to the mass of the other.

          If two masses of metal, of any shape whatever, are  brought under
          perfect assimilation, to one another, THEIR UNITION, when brought
          into contact, WILL BE INSTANT.

          If we  live  in  a SYMPATHETIC FIELD we become sympathetic, and a
          tendency from the abnormal to  the  normal  presents itself by an
          EVOLUTION OF  A  PURELY SYMPATHETIC FLOW TOWARDS  ITS  ATTRACTIVE
          CENTERS.

          It is  only  under  these  conditions that differentiation can be
          broken up, and a pure equation established.

          The only condition under which  EQUATION CAN NEVER BE ESTABLISHED
          IS WHEN A DIFFERENTIAL DISASTER HAS TAKEN PLACE,  of  66  and 2/3
          against the 100 pure, taking the full volume as one.

          If this 66 and 2/3 or even 100 exists in one organ alone, and the
          surrounding ones  are  normal,  then  a  condition  can easily be
          brought about to ESTABLISH THE  CONCORDANT HARMONY OR EQUATION TO
          THAT ORGAN.

          It is as rare to find a negative condition of 66  and 2/3 against
          the volume  of  the  whole  cerebral  mass,  as  it  is to find a
          coincident between differentiation; or, more plainly, between two
          individuals under a state of negative influence.

          Under this new system, it is  as  possible  to  induce  negations
          alike as it is to induce positives alike.

          Pure sympathetic  CONCORDANTS  ARE  AS ANTAGONISTIC  TO  NEGATIVE
          DISCORDANTS AS  THE  NEGATIVE  IS  TO  THE POSITIVE; but the vast
          volume the  sympathetic  holds   over   the  non-sympathetic,  in
          ethereal space, makes it AT ONCE THE RULING MEDIUM AND READJUSTER
          OF ALL  OPPOSING CONDITIONS when properly brought  to  bear  upon
          them.

    Until Keely's "Theoretical  Expose'" is given to science, THERE ARE FEW
    WHO WILL FATHOM THE FULL MEANING OF THESE VIEWS.

    His discoveries embrace  the manner or way OF OBTAINING THE KEYNOTE, or
    "chord of mass,"   of  mineral,  vegetable,   and   animal   substance;
    therefore, the construction of instruments, or machines,  by which this
    law can be  utilized  in  mechanics,  in  arts,  and  in restoration of
    equilibrium of disease, is only a question of the full understanding of
    the operation of this law.

    Keely estimates that, after the introductory  impulse  is  given on the
    harmonic thirds, molecular  vibration  is  increased  from  20,000  per
    second to 100,000,000.

    On the enharmonic  sixths,  that the vibration of the inter-molecule is
    increased to 300,000,000.

    On the diatonic ninths, that atomic vibration reaches 900,000,000.

    On the dominant etheric sixths, 8,100,000,000.

    And on the inter-etheric ninths, 24,300,000,000,  all  of  which can be
    demonstrated by sound colours.
