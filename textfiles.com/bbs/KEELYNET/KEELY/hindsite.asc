       John Ernst Worrell Keely ---- Born September 3, 1827,
                                     Died November 18, 1898.

       Seventy one years  he  walked  and  worked  among  the  citizens  of
       Philadelphia.  Twenty five of those years as an industrious inventor
       and philosopher. Founder of The Keely Motor Company  and  discoverer
       of a means to mechanize the etheric forces of nature.

       The very same  forces  Tesla, Hertz, Crooke and many others wrestled
       with for the  benefit  of  mankind.   Alleged  inventor  of  "aerial
       navigation" or as  it is described today, true "anti-gravity."  This
       was done more than 15 years before Orville and Wilbur raced into the
       wind and immortality.

       A man with  ideas  so  revolutionary  even  today, one hundred years
       later, his ideas are only beginning  to  have  meaning and therefrom
       credence. Through the use of high-frequency photography  we  are now
       discovering what Mr. Keely spoke so truthfully about in his workshop
       to incredulous "scientists." None of whom ever did get the slightest
       idea of his  true  teachings.  The  range of which debunked the then
       current atomic theory in all of its ramifications.

       He then had the courage and vision  to  design,  build  and  operate
       machinery on a totally new realm of understanding!   Which,  at  the
       same time, proved the validity of his statements.  Never once did he
       postulate a new  law or principle without backing his statement with
       verifiable evidence.

       However, his ideas  fell on deaf  and  "dumb"  ears;  no  one  could
       understand him, his  theory  was  light-years  ahead   of   dogmatic
       science; to be able to explain the newly discovered and demonstrated
       laws Mr. Keely  was  forced  to develop an entire vocabulary  *1 - a
       vocabulary so foreign "and strange  to  the  "objective  scientists"
       they couldn't help but shake their heads and walk  away.   Which  of
       course they did, in droves. So totally bizarre was his language to

                                      Page 1





       them they hesitated  to investigate his equipment and demonstrations
       for fear of ridicule from peerage.

       The reader has only to recall the  fate  of  those  who have blessed
       mankind the most, with their minds and efforts in the  past. Who can
       forget the shame  at  the  death  of  Socrates,  the imprisonment of
       Galileo, the ridicule  of  Bacon   and   the   utterly  unforgivable
       ostracization of Nikola Tesla? Who has given more than the One whose
       hands were torn asunder by spikes driven through  them  by  fear and
       envy?

       In this way,  ignorant Man, his head buried by greed and hungary for
       power, has treated those who have  endeavored  to lighten the burden
       of material existence.  The power wielded by these,  can  trace  its
       roots to the  feet  of  each of these men of heart. Which wielder of
       power gives thanks for his gift?

       It is for these reasons Mr. Keely  refused to divulge his secrets to
       the courts. Keely knew man needed his philosophy even more than they
       needed his machines.  For without a parallel moral  development  Man
       would misuse his  winderful  new  science.  A philosophy grew in his
       mind as his knowledge expanded,  til  he  could  see  and  prove the
       Oneness of all Creation.

       Mrs. Clara Bloomfield-Moore tells us Mr. Keely met  with frustration
       on every hand as he attempted to perfect his "Motor"; and it was not
       until Mr. Keely  realized  the spiritual aspects of his creation did
       he begin to make real progress. His  spiritual  insights enabled him
       to "see" the unseeable", and "do the undo-able."

       Concurrent with his mechanical progress there evolved  a  Philosophy
       of Evolution. A  Philosophy  so complete and so compelling, provable
       through his devices, that Mr. Keely  gave more importance to it than
       to his many apparatuses.

       This Philosophy is of greater importance to Man than "Levitation" at
       this juncture in Man's spiritual growth.  For with  such  control of
       mighty forces, man  would  certainly  destroy  himself.  But  with a
       perfect light of understanding Man  would  elevate his consciousness
       to an awareness sufficient to assume his rightful place  beside  the
       Creator and rightfully responsible to that Created.

       This work is  an  effort  to  establish a perspective for the reader
       surrounding the events and people of the later years of the 1800s.

       If it is true we are to learn from  history,  then we can learn from
       those lessons so  evident in this sad yet marvelous  adventure.  Mr.
       Keely wrestled with forces we can't understand and won the match.

       His defeat was  met from the hand of man, by far the worst enemy. It
       is evident that if Man is to succeed  as Co-Creator -he must at some
       point in time - begin to act as though the role was his.

       As you read  these pages, ask "Have things or attitudes  changed  so
       very much?" "Have  they  changed enough?" "Are we deserving of God's
       greatest gift - to let Man share his Throne?"

       Certain matters of historical nature  should  be kept in mind as one
       scans these pages; the "electron" was not fully accepted among

                                      Page 2





       scientists until many  years after Mr. Keely died. The references in
       this book allude to this "elementary,  primordial  element. "Radiant
       matter" has since been called "electrons" or "electron flow."

       Some of these arguments have met with their fate  at  the  hands  of
       atomic physicists, they  claim to have "split the atom," and to have
       witnessed mesons, muons and the like,  all sub-atomic particles. But
       the questions as to what is matter and what is force  have  remained
       as unanswered today as they were then.

       The new developments  in  Kirlian  photography  are  evidencing  new
       forces unaccountable by  "current  atomic  theory",  are  these  new
       forces the same Keely discovered and harnessed in his laboratory?

       Can this "vital  fluid"  surrounding  all living things  even  those
       inorganic items) be  the  "ethereal fluid" of the old alchemists and
       occultist? The forces Keely couldn't  name and express in acceptable
       terms simply because alchemy and occultism were not "acceptable"?

       This work is not intended to be a support for Occultism,  Alchemy or
       any other form  of Science. It is to cast light on a bit of history,
       begun to unfold in Philadelphia  over  one  hundred  years  ago  and
       perhaps not yet opened to its fullest.

       Time will tell whether Mr. John Ernst Worrell Keely  was  either one
       of the world's greatest frauds or one of its greatest inventors.

       *1 - It  has been shown that Keely did not "invent" absurb words and
            terms as others have alleged.  Keely proved himself a master of
            the English language. This can be verified by  anyone who makes
            an effort  to  consult  good encyclopediae and dictionaries. He
            did, however, coin terms or names  for his machines and the new
            aspects of  matter  and force he discovered as  there  were  no
            terms for these things.
