
           Preface to Keelys' Laws of Sympathetic Vibration

    John W. Keely worked out a system detailing the laws which govern
    the fusion of energy into what we perceive as molecular aggregations.

    Keelys' Laws of Vibration also describe the resonant relationships
    which occur between mass aggregations.

    Publisher and author, William J. Colville was a close friend of Keely.
    Colville was also a student of metaphysics.  His friendship with Keely
    resulted in the sharing of many of Keelys' research findings, including
    forty of Keelys'  laws.   These  laws  were  included in a little-known
    metaphysical novel, "Dashed Against the Rock", which was published in
    1894.

    "Dashed Against the  Rock"  is  the  story  of  a  young  establishment
    scientist who is led through stages to the acceptance of the vibratory
    laws which govern mental science.

    Dan A. Davidson,  in  his  book,  "A Breakthrough to  New  Free  Energy
    Sources", gives an excellent condensed history of Keely and his work.

                          KEELYS' LAWS OF VIBRATION

    1. Law of Matter and Force:

        Coextensive and coeternal with space and duration, there exists of
    all matter: these are in a state of constant vibratory motion,infinite
    in extent, unchangeable in quantity the initial of all forms of energy.

    2. Law of Corporeal Vibrations:

         All coherent aggregates when isolated from like bodies, or when
    immersed of confined in media composed of matter in a different state,
    vibrate at a given ascertainable pitch.

    3. Law of Corporeal Oscillation:

         All coherent aggregates not isolated from like bodies, oscillate
    at a period-frequency varying with the tensions that augment and
    diminish the state of equilibrium.

    4. Law of Harmonic Vibrations:

       All coherent aggregates are perpetually vibrating at a period-
    frequency corresponding to some harmonic ratio of the fundamental pitch
    of the vibrating body; this pitch is a multiple of the pitch of the
    atomole.

    5. Law of Transmissive Vibraic Energy:

         All oscillating and vibrating coherent aggregates create in the
    media in which they are immersed, outwardly propagated concentric waves
    of alternate condensation and rarefaction, having a period-frequency
    identical with the pitch of the aggregate.

    6. Law of Sympathetic Oscillation:

         Coherent aggregates immersed in a medium pulsating at their
    natural pitch simultaneously oscillate with the same frequency, whether
    the pitch of the medium be a unison of any harmonic of the fundamental
    pitch of the creative aggregate.

    7. Law of Attraction:

         Juxtaposed coherent aggregates vibrating in unison, of harmonic
    ratio, are mutually attracted.

    8. Law of Repulsion:

         Juxtaposed coherent aggregates vibrating in discord are mutually
    repelled.







                                     Page 2



    9. Law of Cycles:

         Coherent aggregates harmonically united constitute centres of
    vibration bearing relation to the fundamental pitch not multiples ofthe
    harmonic pitch, and the production of secondary unions between
    themselves generate pitches that ate discords, either in their unisons,
    or overtones with the original pitch; from harmony is generated
    discord, the inevitable cause of perpetual transformation.

    10. Law of Harmonic Pitch:

         Any aggregate in a state of vibration develops in addition to its
    fundamental pitch a series of vibration in symmetrical sub-multiple
    portions of itself, bearing ratios of one, two, three, of more times
    its fundamental pitch.

    11. Law of Force:

         Energy manifests itself in three forms; Creative the vibrating
    aggregate: Transmissive, being the propagation of isochronous waves
    through the media in which it is immersed; Attractive, being its action
    upon other aggregates capable of vibrating in unisons or harmony.

    12. Law of Oscillating Atomic Substances:

         Coherent atomic substances are capable of oscillating at a pitch
    varying directly as the density, and inversely as the linear dimensions
    from one period of frequency per unit of time to the 21st octave above,
    producing the creative force of Souity, whose transmissive force
    (Sound) is propagated through the media of solids,liquids, and gases,
    and whose stated effect (Sonism) produces attractions and repulsions.

    13. Law of Sono-thermity:

         Internal vibrations of atomic substances and atomic molecules are
    capable of vibrating at a period-frequency directly as their density,
    inversely as their linear dimensions, directly as the coefficient of
    their tension from the 21st to the 42d octaves, producing the creative
    force (Sono-thermity), whose transmissive force (Sono-therm) is
    propagated in solid, liquid, gaseous, and ultra-gaseous media,
    statically producing adhesions and molecular unions, or disintegration,
    according to the Law of Harmonic Attraction and Repulsion.

    14. Law of Oscillating Atoms:

         All atoms when in a state of tension are capable of oscillating at
    a pitch inversely as the cube of their atomic weights, and directly as
    their tension from 42 to 63 octaves per second, producing the creative
    force (Thermism), whose transmissive force (Rad-energy) propagated in
    solid, liquid, and gaseous ether, produces the static effects (Cohesion
    and Chemism) on other atoms of association, or dissociation, according
    to the Law of Harmonic Attraction and Repulsion.

         Scholium: Dark radiant heat begins at absolute zero temperature,
         and extend  through light, chemical rays, actinic rays, and infra-
         violet rays,  up  to  the dissociation of all molecules to the 63d
         octave.

    15. Law of Vibrating Atomolic Substances:

         Atoms are capable of vibrating within themselves at a pitch
    inversely as the Dyne (the local coefficient of Gravity), and as the
    atomic volume, directly as the atomic weight, producing the creative
    force (Electricity), whose transmissive force is propagated through
    atomolic solids, liquids, and gases, producing induction and the static
    effect of magnetism upon other atoms of attraction or repulsion,
    according to the Law of Harmonic Attraction and Repulsion.

         Scholium: The phenomena of Dynamic Electricity through a metallic
         conductor and of induction are identical. In a metallic conductor,
         the transmission  is  from  atom   to   atom,  through  homologous
         interstices, filled with ether, presenting small  areas  in  close
         proximity. In  crystalline  structures,  heat,  which  expands the
         atoms, by twisting them produces striae, increases the resistance,
         etc. Between parallel wires and  through  air  the induction takes
         place from  large areas through a rarefied medium  composed  of  a
         mixture of  substances,  whose  atoms  are  separated  by waves of
         repulsion of various pitches,  discordant  to electric vibrations;
         the said atoms sympathetically absorb the vibrations and dissipate
         from themselves, as centres, concentric waves of  electric  energy
         which produces heat and gravism.

    16. Law of Oscillating Atomoles:

         Atomoles oscillating at a uniform pitch (determined by their
    uniform size and weight) produce the creative force Atomolity, whose
    transmissive form, Gravism, is propagated through more rarefied media,
    producing the stated effect upon all other atomoles, denominated
    Gravity.

    17. Law of Transformation of Forces:

         All forces are different forms of Universal Energy unlike in their
    period-frequency, merging into each other by imperceptible increments;
    each form representing the compass of 21 octaves. Each form or pitch
    may be transformed into an equivalent quantity of another pitch above
    or below it in the scale of 105 octaves. The transformation can occur
    only through its static effect, developing vibrations of harmonic
    pitches above and below their fundamental vibration, or developing with
    juxtaposed aggregates, resultant and difference, or third order, as the
    case may be.

         Scholium: A table of the intervals and harmonics of the normal
         harmonic scale   will   indicate   the   ratios   in   which   the
         transformation of
         forces will occur.





                                       Page 4



    18. Law of Atomic Pitch:

         Atoms have each a different and definite pitch, at which they
    naturally vibrate.

         Scholium: Atomic pitch is determined directly from its simple
         spectrum.

         Scholium: Atomic pitch is determined by computations from its
         associate spectrum with all other atoms, as in known spectra.

         Scholium: Atomic pitches are more important working data then
         atomic weights; tables of atomic pitches must be precise.

    19. Law of Variation of Atomic Pitch by Rad-energy:

         The higher harmonics and overtones of projected rad-energy are of
    a pitch sufficiently high to cause the atom to expand: by causing the
    atomoles to vibrate systematically the same influence will cause the
    atom to contract, and thus by changing the volume, atomic pitch is
    varied.

    20. Law of Variation of Atomic Pitch by Electricity and Magnetism:

         Electricity and Magnetism produce internal vibration in the atom,
    which are followed by proportional changes in volume and, therefore,
    pitch.

    21. Law of Variation of Atomic Pitch by Temperature:

         Atoms in chemical combination oscillate with increasing amplitude
    directly as the temperature, and simultaneously absorb overtones of
    higher harmonics, producing expansion of volume and diminution of
    pitch.

         Rule: The gradual approach of the temperature of harmonic
         combination can  be  observed  by  mutually comparing superimposed
         spectra; chemical combination commences when the fundamental lines
         of each spectrum bear harmonic ratios by linear measurement.

    22. Law of Pitch of Atomic Oscillation:

         Atoms not isolated and in a state of tension between forces that
    oppose and increase the equilibrium oscillate bodily at a pitch that is
    a resultant of the atomic weight, atomic volume, and tension.

    23. Law of Variation of Pitch of Atomic Oscillation by Pressure:

         The frequency of atomic oscillation increases and diminishes
    inversely as the square of the pressure.








                                     Page 5



    24. Law of Variation of Atomic Oscillation by Temperature:

         The force of cohesion diminishes inversely as the square of the
    distance the atoms are apart, and the force of the chemical affinity
    diminishes in the same ratio. Heat increases the amplitude of the
    oscillations in a direct ratio to the temperature of the natural scale.

         Scholium: New thermometers and accurate thermometric tables, on
         the natural  bases,  wherein  doubling the temperature doubles the
         pitch of the transmissive energy,  are  required.  Such a table of
         temperature will  bear  natural  relations  to   atomic   weights,
         pitches, specific    heats,    chemical    affinities,    fusions,
         solubilities, etc., and will disclose new laws. One table for each
         must be constructed.

    25. Law of Variation of Atomic Oscillation by Electricity:

         The electric current destroys cohesion and chemical tension
    directly as square of current in amperes, inversely as the resistance
    in ohms, inversely as the chemical equivalent, and conversely as the
    coefficient of the difference between the freezing and volatilizing
    temperature of mass acted upon.

    26. Law of Variation of Atomic Oscillation by Sono-thermism:

         Diminishes the tensions directly as the quantity of heat developed
    and in antithetical proportion to the harmonics absolved.

    27. Law of Chemical Affinity:

         Atoms whose atomic pitches are in either unison, harmonic or
    concordant ratios, unite to form molecules.

         Corollary: When two atoms are indifferent, they may be made to
         unite by varying the pitch of either, or both.

         Scholium: This necessitates the construction of tables
         representing variation of atomic pitches by temperature, pressure,
         etc.

         Scholium: Tables of all harmonics and concords, and harmonics
         founded upon a normal harmonic scale, are equally essential.

         Scholium: Optical instruments may be made to measure pitches of
         energy.

    28. Law of Chemical Dissociation:

         If the pitch of either atom, in a molecule, be raised or lowered:
    or, if they both be unequally raised of lowered in pitch until the
    mutual ratio be that of a discord; or, if the oscillation amplitude be
    augmented by heat until the atom are with the concentric waves of
    attraction, - the atoms will separate.





                                     Page 6



    29. Law of Chemical Transposition:

         New molecules must be harmonics of the fundamental pitch.

    30. Law of Chemical Substitution (too complex for brief statement).

    31. Law of Catalysis:

         The presence of harmonics and discords.

    32. Law of Molecular Synthesis and Combination (Organic):

         The molecular pitch must be a derived harmony of the radicals.

         Scholium: Reconstruction of electric units to represent pitches
         and amplitudes.

    33. Law of Chemical Morphology:

         The angle of crystallization is determined by the relation between
    the molecular pitch of the crystallizing substance to the vibration-
    density of the liquid depositing it.

    34. Law of Atomic Dissociation:

         Overtones of high rad-energy pitches produce separation of the
    atomoles and recombinations among the atomolic molecules of the atoms.

    35. Law of Atomolic Synthesis of Chemical Elements:

         Harmonic pitches of atomolity produce association of etheric-
    atomolic particles to form atoms: the kind of atom is determinable by
    the pitches employed.

    36. Law of Heat:

         Atoms under the tension of chemical combination oscillate with an
    amplitude directly as the temperature, inversely as the pressure, and
    as the square   of   the   specific  heat.  Diminishing  the  pitch  of
    oscillation inversely as the square of the distance of the atoms apart,
    and simultaneously increasing  the  vibrating  pitch  of  the  atom  by
    absorption of overtones and higher harmonics.

    37. Law of Electro-chemical Equivalents:

         An atom vibrates sympathetically under the influence of electric
    energy, such undertones of which are absorbed as are a harmonic or
    harmony of the electric pitch; the amount of energy absorbed being
    directly as the arithmetical ratio of the undertone of the fundamental
    electric pitch.

         Scholium: A table of elector-chemical equivalents on the normal
         basis will  indicate  the  electrical  conditions  and  amount  of
         chemical change.



                                     Page 7




    38. Law of Cohesion:

         The cohesion between atoms diminishes directly as the square root
    of the pressure and temperature, and as the square of electric
    intensity.

    39. Law of Refractive Indices:

         A table of the refractive indices of substances indicates their
    molecular pitch; and in connection with crystalline form the phase of
    molecular oscillation.

    40. Law of Electric Conductivity:

         Electric energy is transmitted through homogeneous bodies with a
    completeness in direct proportion as the atoms are more or less perfect
    harmonics of the electric pitch, but not as all through substances
    whose atoms are discordant to the electric pitch; also through
    molecular substances, when their resultant notes are harmonics of the
    electric pitch,-the transmissions being inversely as the temperature,
    directly as the density diminished in proportion to the amount of
    crystallization, and inversely as the cube of the dyne, also directly
    as the reciprocal of the magnetic intensity.
