                              Acoustic Diver Beacons

       University of Florida     researchers    investigating    underwater
       communication systems have discovered  that  the sound "sshhh", when
       played through underwater speakers, enables divers to find their way
       home, even from GREAT DEPTHS and in DARK, MURKY WATER.

       Researchers James Hicks  and  Harry  Hollien, of the  Institute  for
       Advanced Study of  the Communication Processes, discovered that this
       sound played underwater can be heard  by  divers from AS FAR AWAY AS
       500 FEET.

       Three or more underwater speakers are arranged in a  line projecting
       from home base  to  emit  their  signal  in  sequence, much like the
       flashing runway lights at airports.   The  stereo  effect  from this
       pattern guides the divers back to home base.

       The underwater ACOUSTIC BEACON is much more reliable than underwater
       compasses and electronic instruments ordinarily used  for underwater
       navigation.

       The technique should  prove  helpful  to divers working from surface
       ships, oil rigs,  or submarines and  underwater  habitats.   Various
       types of underwater speakers and arrangements have  been  tested  to
       further extend the range.
