               On the Ultimate Constitution of Matter and the
                Action of the Force regulating its Phenomena

    ________________________________________________________________________
    First

         Matter is capable of infinite subdivision.
    ________________________________________________________________________
    Second

         In the aggregation of matter,  force  or  energy  is  stored  up or
    conserved.
    ________________________________________________________________________
    Third

         In the dissociation of matter, force is liberated.
    ________________________________________________________________________
    Fourth

         All matter  is  in  a  state  of  perpetual activity,  whether  the
    substance under consideration  be  inanimate  or  animated,  visible  or
    invisible.
    ________________________________________________________________________
    Fifth

         There is no dividing of matter  and  force into two distinct terms,
    as they both are ONE.  FORCE is liberated matter.  Matter  is  force  in
    bondage.
    ________________________________________________________________________
    Sixth

         All motion is synchronous; no sound or movement can be made but all
    that moves or sounds does so in harmony with something.
    ________________________________________________________________________
    Seventh

         All structures,  whether crystalline or homogeneous, have for their
    unit structures minute bodies called  molecules.   It  is  the motion of
    these molecules with  which  we  have  particularly   to   deal;  as  in
    experimental research and  demonstration, when we produce an action upon
    one molecule we  do  so upon all the  molecules  constituting  the  mass
    operated upon.
    ________________________________________________________________________
    Eighth

         These molecules  have  an  envelope,  rotating  with  inconceivable
    rapidity, formed of  a  high  tenuous ether, whose place in the order of
    subdivision ranks third, the three divisions  being, - first, molecular,
    second, atomic; third, atomolic.  (For convenience sake  we will use the
    term atomolic in place of etheric in our subsequent definitions.)

    Ninth

         This atomolic  substance  has a density approximately 986,000 times
    that of steel, enabling it to permeate  steel as light penetrates glass;
    this rotating envelope  of atomolic substance is in a LIQUID  condition.
    There are four  conditions  of  matter; viz. SOLID, LIQUID, GASEOUS, and
    ULTRA-GASEOUS.  These conditions result  from greater or lesser range of
    oscillation of the composing units individually: this  is  equally true,
    whether the units are molecules, atoms, atomoles, planets, or suns.  BUT
    ONE LAW GOVERNS ALL MATTER.
    ________________________________________________________________________
    Tenth

         This molecular  envelope,  rotating with such great velocity, holds
    in its embrace the next subdivision of matter, the atomic.  There cannot
    ever be more or less than three atoms in any molecule.  These are placed
    so as to form a triangle in the interior;  they  rest  in a condition of
    substance, or matter,  we  will term inter-molecular.   In  this  inter-
    molecular substance we find an enormous energy or force in bondage, held
    thus by the  rotating  envelope  enclosing it.  Were we to rotate a spun
    brass shell, say nine inches in diameter,  at  a  very much less rate of
    speed than that  at  which the molecular envelope rotates,  -  say  nine
    hundred revolutions per  second,  -  its  equator would first bulge out,
    then form into an oval disc.   A solid  block  of  wood  subject to such
    revolution would swiftly  fly  to pieces.  The rotating  envelope  of  a
    molecule, unlike these,  the  greater  its  velocity  of  rotation,  the
    greater is its compression toward  the  centre  of  the  molecule.   The
    rotation of this envelope is of such a nature as to produce  an internal
    pressure upon every  portion  from  every  point  of  the  molecule as a
    sphere.  Were we  to  consider  a  rotating   envelope   as   ordinarily
    understood, it would  be  one  in which the envelope rotated  around  an
    equator having poles  of  no  rotation; i.e. the poles would not possess
    the compressing force of the equator:  the  result  would therefore be a
    compressed equator, and  the inter-molecular substance  would  pass  out
    without resistance at the poles.
    ________________________________________________________________________
    Eleventh

         If it  be  possible let us conceive of an envelope with an equator,
    but destitute of poles, a number of these rotating over the sphere, this
    atomolic envelope possessing an almost  infinite attractive force toward
    the centre of  the molecule, pressing in the inter-molecular  substance,
    whee it is  held  until  this  revolving envelope becomes negatized by a
    certain order of vibration, when the  enclosed  matter rushes out to its
    natural condition of  concordant tenuity, as in the case  of  gunpowder,
    dynamite, and nitro-glycerine.   This  force, we must see, has been held
    in the embrace  of the rotating envelopes  of  the  unit-structures,  or
    where does it  come from?  This force at the time of  an  explosion  was
    liberated by shock  or  fire,  both  being  orders of imparted motion or
    vibration.  How much greater the result  would be were we to associate a
    scientific instrument now  competed,  and shortly to  be  given  to  the
    world, with such  an  agent  as  nitro-glycerine;  one  pound  of nitro-
    glycerine would have its destructive force augmented beyond all possible
    control.  These instruments are carefully concealed by wise masters from
    all persons save the few who are already prepared to study their potency
    with the exclusive end in view of aiding the real scientific progress of

    humanity; and, furthermore,  it  ay  be  truly  stated  that a ferocious
    sensualist, however powerful his intellect,  would  be utterly unable to
    either comprehend or operate one of these marvellous constructions.
    ________________________________________________________________________
    Twelfth

         Next in order of consideration is the second subdivision  of matter
    - the atomic.   The atom has the same rotating envelope as the molecule,
    governed by the same laws of rotation  and  compression.   The  rotating
    envelope holds in  its  embrace  the  inter-atomic substance  and  three
    atomoles resting in  it,  the atomoles within the atom being constructed
    after the same pattern as the atom  and  the  molecule,  obedient to the
    same laws; the  atomolic being simply the third subdivision  of  matter.
    The threefold order is absolutely universal.
    ________________________________________________________________________
    Thirteenth

         The atomolic  substance is what is termed the ether which fills all
    space and is the transmitting medium  for  all celestial and terrestrial
    forces.  This is the LIQUID ETHER of occult science.
    ________________________________________________________________________
    Fourteenth

         The atomoles  are made up of atomolini (singular  atomolinus);  the
    subdivision of matter  from this point is beyond man's power, as at this
    point it escapes all control of apparatus,  passing  through  glass  and
    hardened steel as a luminous flame without heat, which  is  hardly  seen
    before it vanishes, - a perpetual flame coldly luminous.
    ________________________________________________________________________
    Fifteenth

         This again,  from  previous  analysis,  is made up according to the
    triple order, and may again be subject to subdivision, even to infinity.
    ________________________________________________________________________

              The law which governs the triple aggregation
                    of force and matter is (in brief) :

      First ->  CREATIVE SOURCE

                         Second ->  TRANSMISSIVE WAVE

                                                 Third ->  EFFECT
