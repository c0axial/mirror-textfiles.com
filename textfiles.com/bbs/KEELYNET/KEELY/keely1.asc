                       John Keely's Perpetual Motion Machine

       It's a universal  human desire to want to get something for nothing.
       Unfortunately, just about everything  worthwhile  turns  out to have
       some sort of price tag-especially the power needed to run a motor.

       That hasn't stopped inventors from trying, for a good many centuries
       now, to get something for nothing by inventing a so-called perpetual
       motion machine.  Such  a machine is not intended  to  go  on  moving
       forever, as the name might imply.

       Rather, its purpose  is  to  do  useful  work  without drawing on an
       external energy source, or, at the  very  least,  to  give  off more
       energy than is needed to run it.

       Modern physics casts a very doubtful eye on such an enterprise.  The
       first law of  thermodynamics  holds that it's impossible  to  create
       energy, and no one has yet managed to find a loophole in that law.

       Such seeming perpetual  motion  machines as have been built all turn
       out to have some secret power source,  or to be drawing on energy in
       some way that even the inventor perhaps does not realize.

       The laws of  thermodynamics,  though,  are  simply   the  result  of
       centuries of observation.   They report on the nature of things, but
       they are not  universal  laws  handed   down   by   some  infallible
       authority.  Many clever  men  have entertained sneaking  hopes  that
       there might somewhere be an exception to them.

       Most of the  early  perpetual motion machines depended on gravity to
       generate energy.  One type consisted  of  a  closed wheel divided by
       spokes into compartments,  each  compartment containing  a  weighted
       ball.

       The idea was  that  once  the  wheel  was given a starting push, the
       weight of the balls would keep it turning indefinitely.  Eventually,
       though, energy lost through friction  tends  to  slow the wheel down
       and halt it-requiring another push to start the wheel  going  again.
       Not very productive!

       As early as  the  thirteenth century, a Parisian architect observed,
       "Many a time have skilful workmen  tried  to  contrive  a wheel that
       shall turn of itself," and he suggested a way to do  it by weighting
       it with quicksilver or with "an uneven number of mallets."  Leonardo
       da Vinci apparently  experimented  along these lines several hundred
       years later, without results.


                                      Page 1





       In the seventeenth  century,  the  Marquis  of  Worcester  built  an
       elaborate wheel fourteen feet across,  weighted  by  metal  balls of
       fifty pounds apiece.

       A German inventor a century later constructed a similar  device, but
       in neither case  was  perpetual  motion  achieved.  A mill turned by
       waterpower is a classic producer of energy.  The mill will only turn
       so long as the millstream is flowing;  in order to get energy out of
       the system, energy must go in, and if the stream runs dry, the mills
       stops.

       A number of  inventors  tackled  the  problem  of   constructing   a
       recycling mill system; water would run past the mill's wheel, making
       it turn, and then somehow would be lifted back to its starting point
       to turn the  wheel again.  Alas, the lifting process required energy
       too, and so  the inventors who tried  to  build  such  installations
       found that they  were  out  of  luck  so  far  as  free  energy  was
       concerned.

       Many other ingenious-sounding  gadgets  were designed, based on this
       principle and that, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  All
       of them foundereed on the same point.   No  matter  what  method was
       used to keep the motor going, that method demanded  energy  in  some
       fashion.  Every one  of  these perpetual motion machines required an
       energy input.

       Then a clever Yankee named John Worrell Keely came along in 1872 and
       showed the world how it could be done.

       Keely proposed to use the energy  of  atoms  as  his  power  source.
       Nobody in 1872,  least  of  all  Keely,  knew  anything   about  the
       phenomenon we call  radioactivity,  which makes possible the release
       of energy from heavy elements like uranium.  He meant to draw energy
       from simpler, more easily available substances-such as water.

       All atoms, Keely said, were in CONSTANT  VIBRATION.  (Which is true,
       by the way.)   The  trick  was  to harness and CHANNEL  THIS  RANDOM
       VIBRATION.

       Keely claimed to  be  able  to  make  the atoms in a given substance
       vibrate together, IN UNISON.  He  could  then  draw  on the "etheric
       force" of these vibrating atoms to run any motor of any size.

       In 1872, Keely began to seek funds for his invention.   He went on a
       far-ranging lecture tour, telling the world his wonderful tale.  The
       great discovery, he declared, had had its origin when he picked up a
       violin and fiddled a few notes.

       The notes set  in motion HARMONIC VIBRATIONS, and he saw, in a flash
       of inspiration, how the VIBRATIONS  OF ATOMS COULD BE USED TO CREATE
       ENERGY.

       He set up the Keely Motor Company in New York and held  a meeting at
       the plush Fifth   Avenue   Hotel.    It  was  attended  by  bankers,
       businessmen, engineers, lawyers-a   group  of  wealthy,  adventurous
       individuals looking for a good investment.  This  was  an  era  when
       great fortunes were being made in America by sharp-witted men.

       John D. Rockefeller was building his billion-dollar oil empire; Jay

                                      Page 2





       Gould, the Vanderbilts,  E.H.  Harriman,  and  others  were  earning
       millions from their railroad operations;  and  Andrew  Carnegie  was
       growing rich manufacturing steel.  Miraculous inventions  were  just
       around the corner;  Alexander  Graham Bell and his telephone, Thomas
       Alva Edison and electric lights, phonographs,  motion pictures.  The
       Wright Brothers would  soon  be  dreaming of airplanes.   Other  men
       would seek ways to build gasoline-powered "horseless carriages."
       And here was  John Worrell Keely, offering a fantastic new source of
       power!

       The investors flocked to his side.   The day after his first meeting
       at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, Keely was given ten thousand  dollars  to
       continue his research,  with  the assurance that more funds would be
       forthcoming as he needed them.

       He had awed  his  audience  with phrases  like  "quadruple  negative
       harmonics," "etheric disintegration,"  and  "atomic  triplets."   He
       explained that his  machine was a "hydro-pneumatic, pulsating vacuum
       engine," which was hooked up to a device he called a "liberator."

       The "liberator" was a series of HIGHLY SENSITIVE TUNING FORKS, whose
       vibrations disintegrated air and water,  liberating  "etheric force"
       of great power.

       Keely demonstrated a model of his vacuum engine.  He  poured a glass
       of water into  its  intake,  and moments later the engine rumbled to
       life.  A gauge  attached  to it showed  that  a  pressure  of  fifty
       thousand pounds per square inch had been created.

       The audience gasped as etheric force ripped thick cables apart, bent
       iron bars, and  fired bullets through foot-deep planks.   The  whole
       thing seemed incredible.

       Speaking glibly and  rapidly,  Keely  reeled  off the wonders of his
       invention:

          "With these three agents alone  [air, water and machine], unaided
           by any  and  every  compound,  heat,  electricity  and  galvanic
           action, I  have  produced  in  an unappreciable time by a simple
           manipulation of  the  machine,   a   VAPORIC  SUBSTANCE  at  one
           expulsion of a volume of ten gallons having an elastic energy of
           10,000 pounds to the square inch....It has a vapor of so fine an
           order IT WILL PENETRATE METAL....It is LIGHTER THAN HYDROGEN and
           more powerful than steam or ANY EXPLOSIVES KNOWN....I once drove
           an engine 800 revolutions a minute of forty horsepower with LESS
           THAN A THIMBLEFUL OF WATER and kept it running fifteen days WITH
           THE SAME WATER."

       This, obviously, was  NOT  the same old perpetual  motion  that  all
       intelligent people knew   was   an  impossibility.   Keely  was  not
       depending on such hopeless methods  as  weighted wheels or endlessly
       cycling water.  A  man  had  only  to  look  in  the   ENCYCLOPAEDIA
       BRITANNICA to find  out why those devices COULD NOT WORK.  No, Keely
       had something brand new-etheric force.

       The stockholders of the Keely Motor  Company smiled knowingly at one
       another, quietly congratulating themselves for their  perception and
       farsightedness.  They all  knew that John W. Keely was going to make
       them millionares.

                                      Page 3





       Which financial backing  assured,  Keely set up a laboratory at 1420
       North Twentieth Street  in  Philadelphia,   and   this   became  the
       headquarters of the Keely Motor Company.

       Money poured in, and he began to build full-scale machines.   Within
       two years, on  November  10,  1974, Keely was showing off to a proud
       group of stockholders his first "vibratory generator."

       This was a preliminary model for an  even more ambitious machine, on
       which he would  spend the next fourteen years.  A  newspaperman  who
       attended the 1874  demonstration of the wonderful machine wrote that
       the generator operated,

             "out of  a bath tub from which  a  stream  of  water,  passing
              through a  goose-quill,  sets  the  entire   contrivance   in
              motion."

       The years went  by, Keely toiled on.  The Keely Motor Company showed
       no profits and paid no dividends,  but  Keely  explained that he was
       still deep in research and development.  One day soon,  he said, the
       patience of the  stockholders  would be rewarded by a golden flow of
       cash.

       Some of the stockholders were restless.   By  now,  Bell's telephone
       was in public  use,  Edison  had  produced  wonder after  profitable
       wonder, and the  first  sputtering  automobiles  were  chugging down
       highways at a hesitant pace.  Meanwhile,  their hero, Keely, had not
       yet put his motor into commercial use.

       The investors journeyed  down  to  Philadelphia  regularly.    Keely
       received them graciously,   showed   them   around  the  laboratory,
       demonstrated his machines.  He invited  them  to  watch him at work.
       "You won't disturb me," he assured them as he became  involved  with
       humming generators and throbbing tuning forks.

       From time to  time, of course, Keely required new funds for "further
       research."  The stockholders usually  obliged.   Keely  would call a
       meeting of the board of directors, and generally would  enhance  his
       progress report by  throwing in a few new technical terms each time.
       The old investors  voted new funds;  fresh  capital  came  into  the
       company too, from men anxious to get in on the eventual bonanza.

       With power from his motor, Keely declared, it would  be  possible to
       send a train of cars from Philadelphia to San Francisco with no fuel
       OTHER THAN A  SINGLE  CUP  OF  WATER.   (Actually,  Keely  was being
       conservative, We now know that if  the  energy contained in a gallon
       of water could  be  COMPLETELY LIBERATED, it could  keep  trains  or
       ocean liners running for several years instead of just a few trips.)

       One of Keely's  most  enthusiastic  backers  was  a well-to-do widow
       named Mrs. Clara  Jessup  Bloomfield-Moore.    Whenever   the  other
       stockholders fretted  at  the lack of results, Mrs. Bloomfield-Moore
       urged them to  have  faith  in  Keely.   She invested heavily in the
       company herself, and encouraged friends to do the same.

       Then, too, she wrote glowing, hig-flown  articles  about  Keely that
       appeared in the most widely read magazines of the day.   In one, she
       said that Keely's etheric force was "like the sun behind the clouds,
       the source of  all  light  though  itself  unseen.  It is the latent
       basis of all human knowledge..."
                                      Page 4





       As president of the Keely Motor Company, Keely found it necessary to
       live in high  style  at the stockholders' expense.  It would not do,
       he told them, for the head of such  an important enterprise to dress
       shabbily, to ride in broken-down carriages, or to live  in a squalid
       house.  They agreed.  So a good deal of the investors' money went to
       support Keely in   a  manner  he  thought  suitable  for  a  company
       president.  The rest was spent on ever more complex machinery.

       His new prize was a "shifting resonator"-a forbidding-looking affair
       of wires, tubes, and adhesive plates,  enclosed  in  a  hollow brass
       sphere.  This was linked by a series of wires to  the  famous  motor
       itself, and to  a  transmitter that bristled with steel rods in such
       numbers that it looked like a mechanical porcupine.

       The resonator, Keely explained, carried  SEVER  DIFFERENT  KINDS  OF
       VIBRATION, each "being  capable  of infinitesimal division."   Keely
       would set the   whole  contraption  going  in  a  variety  of  ways;
       sometimes by playing a few notes  on  his  violin,  sometimes with a
       zither or a  harmonica,  sometimes  by striking an  ordinary  tuning
       fork.  Whatever the  method,  etheric force came forth, starting the
       motor.

       The motor itself was a sturdy IRON HOOP encircling a DRUM with EIGHT
       SPOKES.  When etheric force began  to  radiate,  the  big drum would
       begin to spin  rapidly-dramatic  testimony to the power  of  Keely's
       machine.

       Keely declined to  take out any patents on his masterpiece, however.
       Some of the  stockholders  were worried  by  this.   Should  he  not
       protect their rights with a patent?

       No, Keely said.   A  patent application would have  to  contain  the
       essential information about  the workings of his invention.  But the
       invention, though it  obviously worked,  was  not  quite  ready  for
       commercial development.

       Keely told the  investors  that  he feared some unscrupulous  pirate
       might study his  patent  application,  steal  his basic ideas, adapt
       them in some slightly different  form,  and  beat  the  Keely  Motor
       Company to the  market.   It  was far better, he insisted,  to  keep
       every detail of  the project a secret until the grand moment arrived
       when etheric force  could be put  to  moneymaking  use.   Otherwise,
       there was a good chance that the investment of the stockholders, and
       Keely's long years of toil, would all go for nothing.

       By this time, many leading scientists and engineers  had heard about
       Keely's wonderful motor, and they wanted to know how it worked.  Was
       there such a  thing  as etheric force?  Did Keely's vibrators really
       tap the energy of the atoms?  Perhaps-but Keely's refusal to explain
       his methods was suspicious.  Other  engineers  began to wonder about
       the possibility of  a  hoax.   Was  there  some way  of  duplicating
       Keely's results through known techniques?

       Yes, said the  magazine  SCIENTIFIC  AMERICAN.   In  1884, it ran an
       article describing a  series of experiments  aimed  at  discrediting
       Keely.  Everything that Keely had done, the magazine  said, could be
       duplicated using compressed  air as the source of energy.  Did Keely
       have a hidden compressed-air supply somewhere near his motor?


                                      Page 5





       Keely sidestepped the  attacks.   The  other  engineers, he told his
       backers, were petty, envious, disappointed men.

       Unable to meet his enigmatic challenge,  they were reduced to trying
       to pull him down to their level.  He reminded them  how scoffers had
       laughed at the  inventors  of  the steamship, the telegraph, and the
       telephone.  Every startling new advance, Keely said, was accompanied
       by this sort of sniping by prejudiced, ignorant men.

       The hubbub died  down.   Keely went  on  experimenting,  his  secret
       undivulged.  Mrs. Bloomfield-Moore,  though  her  loyalty  to  Keely
       remained unshaken, came to him with a suggestion.

       Perhaps, she said, Keely ought to take Thomas Edison in as a partner
       and confide the  secret  in him.  Edison was the world's most famous
       inventor; nobody dared to sneer at him any more.  If Edison lent his
       great prestige to the Keely Motor  Company,  it would mean an end to
       the attacks on Keely himself.

       Keely may have seen that it would be good public relations  to  make
       use of Edison's  name, but he refused to hear of the idea.  He would
       tell his secret to no one, CERTAINLY  not to Edison.  He had no need
       for another man's  prestige,  he insisted.  Those who  attacked  him
       today would praise  him  wildly tomorrow.  And he went on asking the
       stockholders for money and building ever more grandiose machines.

       He printed up a mysterious chart,  as  occult as anything ever drawn
       by a medieval  astrologer,  and handed it out to his  long-suffering
       investors.  It showed overlapping circles, cones of radiating lines,
       various oddly shaped figures, and a series of musical notations.

       Supposedly, the secret  of  the  etheric vibrations was contained on
       the chart, and  many of the stockholders  framed  their  copies  and
       displayed them with great satisfaction.  What did it  all  mean?  No
       one knew.  But it looked very profound, terribly significant.

       By 1898, Keely  had  kept  his  company running for twenty-six years
       without ever once putting a product  on  the  market.   It  had  not
       earned a penny in all that time.

       An army of  investors  had thrown hundreds of thousands  of  dollars
       into the Keely  Motor Company, enabling its president and founder to
       live a comfortable and luxurious life  while  building his vibrators
       and liberators and generators.

       From year to  year, he performed a delicate juggling  act  with  the
       stockholders , persuading  them  that prosperity was just around the
       corner.  And they believed him, for who could fail to be awed by the
       demonstrations he gave, by his  glib  talk,  by  his  air  of  self-
       confidence?

       Then, in 1898, Keely died.  And his secret had died  with  him,  the
       horrified investors found  out.  Nowhere had he set down any clue to
       the workings of his motor.

       Mrs. Bloomfield-Moore, his most ardent  supporter,  followed  him to
       the grave soon  afterward.   Upon  her  death, he son,  Clarence  B.
       Moore, rented the building that had housed Keely's laboratory.


                                      Page 6





       Clarence Moore had  been  forced  to  stand  by helplessly for years
       while his mother showered Keely with cash; now he wanted to see just
       what the fast-talking inventor had been up to.

       Moore got together an investigating group consisting of a well-known
       electrical engineer and  two  professors   from  the  University  of
       Pennsylvania.  They prowled through Keely's building.

       The liberators and generators and other apparatus had  been  carried
       away by Keely's  supporters.   But  one  clue  of  the mystery still
       remained.

       They found a big steel globe, weighing  three  tons,  hidden  in the
       cellar.  It had an opening on its upper surface.   Pipes  and  tubes
       lay nearby.  It  looked  very  much like some sort of compressed air
       device-just as the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN  article had guessed, back in
       1884!

       Moore and his associates ripped up the flooring of the room in which
       Keely had conducted  his demonstrations.  Brass tubes  ran  downward
       through the floor, through cunningly designed holes in the walls, to
       the cellar-leading to the giant steel globe.  The secret was out.

       Keely's motor had  been  powered  by gusts of compressed air, rising
       from the globe  in  the  cellar.   PERHAPS  he  had  controlled  the
       apparatus by using a foot-operated pedal in the floor, THEY GUESSED.

       When he picked  up his violin or harmonica to create  the  "harmonic
       vibrations" that supposedly  triggered the motor, he MIGHT well have
       tapped on the pedal, as though beating time with his foot.

       For a quarter of a century, Keely's  financial  backers had solemnly
       swallowed his brand of hokum.  They did not change their minds now.

       They refused to   accept  Clarence  Moore's  expose'.    Moore   was
       "embittered," they declared, because his mother had invested heavily
       in Keely's company against his own wishes.  He had deliberatesly set
       out to SMEAR THE DEAD KEELY by way of proving his mother's folly.

       Some of Keely's  supporters  went  on insisting, to the end of their
       days, that if Keely had lived only  a  few  more years he would have
       brought about a new industrial revolution.

       No one talks of etheric force today, and we have more effective ways
       of getting energy out of atoms.  But the STRANGE  THING  about  John
       Worrell Keely is  that  he had an undeniable knack for gadgetry.  If
       he had so chosen, he might perhaps  have made a real contribution to
       technology employing compressed air-which eventually  came  to  have
       considerable industrial use.   His  years  of  research  might  have
       produced something of true benefit.

       Instead, he hoodwinked a group of  foolish,  money-hungry  investors
       for a quarter  of  a  century  while doing nothing but  constructing
       clever but useless  machines.   The  investors  probably got no more
       than they deserved.  And Keely, who  might have been another Edison,
       attained high rank in America's gallery of rogues.

       Vangard notes...

           The above article shows a typical cascading of  errors resulting
           from an incomplete understanding or study of Keely and his work.

           One of  the  most  tedious  is  the  continual  claim that Keely
           claimed to be building a "perpetual  motion  machine."  Keely AT
           NO TIME  in his life said he was working on a "perpetual  motion
           machine." In fact, he hotly denied it.

           His claim  was  that  he could tap energy from the "interstitial
           regions of molecules and atoms."   The  contention  that  he was
           drawing energy  from the vibrations which occur  continually  in
           all things, specifically on an atomic level is partially true.

           Keely said  he  could  tap  energy from any of several different
           levels, molecular, atomic or  etheric.   Energy  from each level
           was of successively higher quality in that it was more potent.

           This was   based   on  the  fact  that  the  frequencies   would
           necessarily be  much  higher  (thus of greater amplitude) as the
           physical size of the particles became smaller.

           Another MAJOR ERROR is the primitive  contention  that Keely was
           referring to ATOMIC ENERGY.  Those of us who stay abreast of the
           newer discoveries clearly recognized ZERO POINT  ENERGY  and the
           TACHYON FIELD  as  being  synonymous  with  "etheric  force" and
           "ether."

           It is amazing that Keely recognized  this  so long ago and it is
           just now coming to a point of understanding and  soon  to become
           realization in practical devices.

           Yet another  error  is the statement that compressed air was the
           source of his power.  No one challenged Keely nor DUPLICATED HIS
           FEATS during his lifetime.  The  steel  globe was explained in a
           newspaper article many years earlier as being  an  old  piece of
           equipment from his early researches.

           He had advanced far beyond requiring a STORAGE DEVICE for the

                                      Page 8





           etheric vapor  and  now  GENERATED  IT  ON  THE  SPOT instead of
           requiring an accumulator.

           In the interest of openness and  fairness,  we include this file
           on KeelyNet because it is written in a popular fashion and gives
           some interesting observations on the reasons people  think Keely
           was a fraud.

           We have  long  since  come  to  the  conclusion  that  Keely was
           advanced FAR BEYOND even modern physics.  Unfortunately, he most
           likely DID CHEAT on some of his  demonstrations  in an effort to
           garner more money for his ever more intense researches.

           Over his  lifetime, Keely developed COMPLETE SYSTEMS,  not  just
           isolated devices.   During  his  research,  he  found a definite
           mind/matter link which was a major  reason  he could not release
           it to  the  public.   The  incredibly sensitive  tuning  of  his
           devices acted to amplify the energy of the operator.

           We now KNOW that the effects can be achieved without using tuned
           masses but  through  the use of forced vibrations from magnetic,
           acoustic or electric techniques.
