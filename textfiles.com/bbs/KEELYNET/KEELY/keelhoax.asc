                             THE KEELY MOTOR HOAX

        After the  search  for  perpetual  motion  was  abandoned by true
   scientists, and the fallacy became too generally recognized to make it
   a means of coaxing money from the  credulous  investor,  the idea took
   the no less insidious character of a machine which required a constant
   moderate supply of power from an outside source, but would return this
   many times over.

        This result was to be accomplished by means of special mechanical
   actions or reactions  which  were  declared  to be either  wholly  new
   discoveries, or else   actions  that  were  not  commonly  understood.
   Practically unlimited supplies of  power  could  be produced at little
   cost.

        These special actions were, of course, the inventor's secret, but
   among them `vibration' was one of  most potent, and  twin  brother  to
   this was `radiation.'    A   celebrated  instance  of  this  phase  of
   perpetual motion vagary was the Keely  Motor.  This while not claiming
   to be a perpetual motion machine, did purport to furnish  motive power
   with a minimum expenditure of energy upon it.

        It comes  therefore  in the class that legitimately succeeded the
   efforts to secure perpetual motion;  but  instead  of  being a sincere
   attempt to advance mechanical science by a genuine discovery  of a new
   principle or some  new  application  of old principles it was a fraud,
   although masquerading for a long time  under  the  garb of honesty. It
   possessed so many of the characteristics of this kind  of foible as to
   justify a somewhat extended account of it.

        The inventor  John Worrell Keely was a carpenter, who was born in
   Philadelphia in 1837 and died there  in  1898.  He was a good mechanic
   and a very clever talker, but not a highly educated man.

        With a  claim to have discovered a new force in  mechanics  which
   was to work  wonders,  he  succeeded in inducing a dozen engineers and
   capitalists to organize a Keely Motor Company in New York in 1872, and
   to subscribe ten thousand dollars  to  begin  the  construction of the
   motor.  He immediately applied his money to the purchase  of  material
   and the construction  of machinery, and began to attract the attention
   of the public in 1874 when he gave a demonstration of the motor before
   a small company of prominent citizens  of  Philadelphia, November 10th
   of that year.

        Among the  expedients  resorted  to  in exploiting  a  scientific
   fraud, mystifying lingo is one of the commonest, and in this Mr. Keely
   was an adept.  At  this demonstration the machine, or so much of it as
   was then to be exhibited, was called  a  "vibratory-generator";  in  a
   later demonstration  it  was a "hydro-pneumatic-pulsating-vacu-engine"
   and changes in  nomenclature were being rung continually always vague,
   delightfully general, and suggesting unlimited possibilities.

        The inventor's  funds  began  to  run  low,  but his plausibility
   sufficed to keep  him  afloat  and   he   so  completely  deluded  his
   supporters, especially his  most  ardent  one, Mrs. Bloomfield  Moore,
   that he continued  to  hold  their  interest, and was kept on his feet
   financially. By 1890, however, the  stockholders  had become too weary
   (or wary) to be put off by evasions or tricks.

        Mr. Keely  declared  he  was now on the eve of  success;  he  had
   arrived at that  crucial stage, lacking just the one slight adjustment
   which, in all  such cases, proves  the  insurmountable  bar  to  final
   achievement.  His "generator" had now become a "liberator" which would
   disintegrate air and release an etheric force of cyclonic strength.

        One spectator at a demonstration said that a pint of water poured
   into a cylinder  seemed to work great wonders. " The  gauge  showed  a
   pressure of more than fifty thousand pounds to the square inch.

        Great ropes  were  torn apart, iron bars broken in two or twisted
   out of shape, bullets discharged  through  twelve  inch  planks,  by a
   force which could not be determined.

        In the glory of his exuberance Keely now declared  that  with one
   quart of water,  he  would  be  able  to  send  a  train  of cars from
   Philadelphia to San Francisco, and that to propel a steamship from New
   York to Liverpool and return would  require  just  about one gallon of
   the same." (Julius Moritzen, in the The Cosmopolitan for April 1899.)

        His technical   terms  were  bewildering,  intentionally   so   ;
   `molecular vibration, ' `sympathetic equilibrium,' `oscillation of the
   atom, ' `etheric   disintegration,'  `quadruple  negative  harmonics,'
   `atomic triplets,' came glibly from his lips to confuse or to enthrall
   his auditors.

        At that  time one of the greatest  steamships  in  operation  the
   Teutonic of the  White Star line, crossed the Atlantic  in  six  days,
   driven by engines of 17000 H.P., expending about 2,500,000 H.P.- hours
   of energy. That is just about the amount of energy now estimated to be
   liberated if the  hydrogen in a half-pint of water were converted into
   helium. Keely was far within bounds!

        Public interest in the Keely  Motor  dates  from  1874.  From the
   first, with the use of no agents but air, water, and  the machine, its
   inventor made pretensions and promises that were more extravagant than
   those of any visionary or faker that preceded him.

        The claim  to produce magical results by means of a thimbleful of
   water with appropriate juggling was  not  new,  but,  as  Mr. Benjamin
   wrote in 1886, "a power-creating machine of no known  form  or mode of
   operation, when based   on  notions  upset  eighty  years  ago,  is  a
   wonderful thing.  To the confusion of the skeptics, the Keely motor is
   here, that is, not here but to be here  three weeks hence. It has been
   going to be here three hence for twelve years." ("The  Persistence  of
   the Keely Motor," by Park Benjamin, The Forum for June 1886.)

        He ascribes   the   persistence   of   this   delusion  to  sheer
   psychological perversity in that portion  of the public that hesitates
   to put any  limit to the possibilities of science, as  it  understands
   the term science.

        The New Science Review for April 1895, nine years later, has an

                                    Page 2
   article discussing the action of the motor, entitled "The Operation of
   the Vibratory Circuit,"  by  Mr.  Keely  himself,  that  is  an almost
   incredible jumble of terms.

        He anchored his analysis of nature  to  a  fundamental "trinity."
   Every force and practically everything else was "triune."  For him the
   sacred number was not seven but three.

        The basic idea of Keely's theory was that if one  could catch and
   impose upon matter,  by  sympathetic  vibration,  the  extremely rapid
   vibration that characterizes every  atom  and  molecule,  then, by the
   resonance of atoms,  he  could  effect  a  recombination   that  would
   liberate and incalculable amount of energy.

        At the  time  of  these  experiments radioactivity and the highly
   radioactive substances were  not known;  radio-telegraphy  and  radio-
   telephony had not dawned upon us and yet, how near each  other  wisdom
   and folly may sit!

        Keely's pretensions appear to have anticipated the very phenomena
   and powers now  associated  with radioactivity and wireless signaling;
   and when we consider the discussions  and revelations of atomic energy
   coming as genuine  science within the last two or three  years,  these
   seem like an  Alpine  glow  of  which  he  had  some  glimmering, upon
   inaccessible peaks which he vainly  strove to reach; but again when we
   recollect that within a week of the close of the year  1920, a Leipsic
   engineer fooled many  savants by fraudulent claim to have discovered a
   way to `liberate' (Keely's own word)  and yet control that same atomic
   energy, we can see what an easy path to notoriety the  charlatan finds
   along such lines.

        It was  not  until after Keely's death that the fraudulent nature
   of his scheme  was  established.   It  was  then  brought  out  by  an
   examination of his laboratory after the motor had been removed, and it
   was found that  the  extraordinary  performances  of  his  complicated
   machinery were controlled  from  a  cellar in which a source of motive
   power was operated.

        This source of power was not  actually  identified  but pipes and
   connections seemed to indicate pretty plainly that it  was  compressed
   air, which could be manipulated by the demonstrator in the laboratory.
   Yet his real secret has never been revealed.

        The motor  was  taken  to  Boston  and  set  up, but it failed to
   exhibit any "etheric force" when subjected to any vibratory influence,
   after its removal form the laboratory in Philadelphia. For a period of
   more than twenty-five years did this  remarkable  trickster  not  only
   keep his chicanery   hidden  but  escaped  the  discovery   that   his
   pretensions really were  impostures,  and  this in the face of experts
   and others who witnessed tests of his machine.

        Many an untrained witness was astounded by `ocular' evidence, and
   to such an one the doubting smile  of  one  who  had  not  `seen'  was
   irritation , to say the least.

        Perpetual motion  continues  to  be  achieved, but  the  `working
   model' does not  appear.  The  machine  is  set going, soon comes to a
   stop, and consistently refuses to  operate  without  help, a failure -
   the souvenir of  a  delusion  -  of no more use than  the  Millerite's
   ascension robe after the twenty-second of October, 1844.
