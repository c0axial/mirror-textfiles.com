                              Mineral Disintegration
                   and more of Keely's work and stumbling blocks

       A short time ago the mining world  in  America  was  seized  with an
       inexplicable excitement. The  value  of  gold  mines  in  particular
       suddenly rose. Mines  long since abandoned on account of the expense
       of working, awoke, and rubbing their  eyes made their way again into
       the stock list.

       Presently it leaked  out that a syndicate of the longest-headed  and
       wealthiest mining capitalists  were  quietly buying up all the cheap
       and apparently worthless gold mines  they  could hear of, and people
       at once concluded that something was up.

       Then everyone of  a speculative turn, very knowingly  began  to  buy
       worthless gold mining shares at ever-increasing prices, and when the
       little speculators had gorged themselves to the full extent of their
       financial capacity, they  asked: What next? No one knew exactly what
       he was after; and everyone looked  to  the  Syndicate  for  the next
       move; but the Syndicate smilingly put its hands in  its  pockets and
       whistled! After the  fever  came prostration. The small fry had not,
       like the Syndicate, bought to hold,  so  they got first uneasy, then
       alarmed, and finally panic-stricken.

       The tide of credulity turned and began to run out even  more quickly
       than it had  set in, and thousands of the unlucky, but greedy little
       grudgeon of the Stock Exchange were left stranded in a short time by
       the receding tide of speculation,  kicking and gasping in the mortal
       agonies of financial asphyxia.

       The panic is easily accounted for by the general  laws  that  govern
       the movements of  the  Stock  Exchange; but not so the action of the
       syndicate. The problem remains: Why did the long-headed millionaires
       buy up worthless mines? That is  the  point  of  interest,  and  the
       explanation thereof is as follows:


                                      Page 1





            A few  weeks  before  the  panic  occurred,  twelve solid men -
            millionaires - met by appointment  in  a  certain laboratory in
            Philadelphia to witness an exhibition of the disintegration  of
            quartz by  a  new  method. They were mining magnates, who had a
            tremendous interest in getting  the  gold  out  of  quartz rock
            quickly and cheaply.

            The inventor  obliged them by simply touching  some  blocks  of
            quartz with  a  little  machine  he held in his hand; and as he
            touched each block it instantly  crumbled  into atomic dust, in
            which the  specks  of  gold  it had contained  stood  out  like
            boulders in a bed of sand.

            Then the  twelve solid men solidly said: Mr. Keely, if you will
            in the same manner disintegrate  some  quartz  for  us  in  its
            natural place, we will each of us give you a cheque for ($1000)
            ---- dollars.

            So off they all went to the Katskill mountains,  and  there the
            twelve solid  men pointed out a reef of quartz on the side of a
            mountain, as solid as themselves;  and  Mr.  Keely took out his
            little machine and said: Gentlemen,please take the time.

            In eighteen minutes there was a tunnel in that  quartz mountain
            eighteen feet  long  and four and a half feet in diameter. Then
            Mr. Keely quietly returned to  Philadelphia with his cheques in
            his pocket, and the twelve solid men went from  New York to San
            Francisco to  gather  in the seemingly worthless stock of mines
            long disused because of the working expense, thus producing the
            disastrous effect upon the mining  world,  which  we  have just
            seen. (All these men bound themselves to secrecy;  and  this is
            the first time that this incident has been made public.)

       How was the quartz disintegrated?--That is one of Keely's secrets.
       The disintegration of  the  rock  is,  however,  a  very  small  and
       accidental effect of that tremendous  force  that  lies  behind  the
       secret. Indeed, that  particular  application  of the  force  was  a
       chance discovery.

       One day the  inventor  was  studying the action of currents of ether
       playing over a floor upon which he  had  scattered  fine sand,---the
       ether was rolling  the sand into ropes,---when a block  of  granite,
       which was used  for  fastening  back a door, disintegrated under his
       eyes.  He took the hint, and in a  few  days he had made a vibratory
       disintegrator.

       Who is this  man,  and  what is this force? to whom,  or  to  which,
       boring a tunnel into the mountain side is mere child's play? Surely,
       were such things  true, science would long ago have filled the world
       with the renown of such a man---the  man  who has discovered a force
       in nature compared to which all known motor or mechanical forces are
       like the scratch of a nail, or the breath of a child.

       Surely the press,  the  platform,  and  even the pulpit  would  have
       resounded with the  glad  tidings  of  so  great  a victory over the
       stubborn powers of  nature, a victory  which  goes  so  far  towards
       making man the master of things in this material plane!

       Those who argue like that know little of modern science and its

                                      Page 2





       votaries. An Anglican  bishop  never  ignored  a dissenting preacher
       with more dignified grace than the  professor  of  orthodox  science
       ignores the heterodox genius who has the audacity to  wander  beyond
       the limitations which   received   opinion   has   placed  upon  the
       possibilities of nature.

       The fact is that men of science have  persistently ignored, and know
       absolutely nothing about, the great department of nature  into which
       Keely penetrated years  ago, and in which he has now made himself at
       home.

       Not long ago  a  Fellow of the Royal  Society  of  Edinburgh,  Major
       Ricarde-Seaver, went to Philadelphia to convince himself  as  to the
       nature of Keely's  discovery.  He  returned,  saying  that Keely was
       working with, and had the apparent  command over forces, the nature,
       or even the very existence, of which was absolutely  unknown to him,
       and so far as he is aware, to modern science.

       Beyond disintegration lies  dispersion, and Keely can just as easily
       dissolve the atoms of matter as disintegrate its molecules. Dissolve
       them into what?   Well,---into    ether,    apparently;   into   the
       hypothetical substratum which modern scientists have postulated, and
       about whose nature they know absolutely nothing but what they invent
       themselves, but which to Keely is not a hypothesis,  but  a  fact as
       real as his  own  shoes;  and  which  ether, indeed, seems to be the
       protoplasm of all things.

       As to the law of gravity, it appears  very  like  a delusion, in the
       light of Keely's experiments, or, at least, but one manifestation of
       a law of very much wider application---a law which  provides for the
       reversion of the  process of attraction in the shape of a process of
       repulsion.

       One of Keely's little scientific experiments  is to put a small wire
       round an iron cylinder that weighs several hundred  weight, and when
       the force runs  through  the  wire,  to  lift the cylinder up on one
       finger and carry it as easily as if it were a piece of cork.

       Not long ago he moved, single-handed,  a  500  horse-power vibratory
       engine from one part of his shop to another. There was not a scratch
       on the floor, and astounded engineers declared that  they  could not
       have moved it  without  a derrick, to bring which in operation would
       have required the removal of the roof of the shop.

       Of course it is but a step in advance of this to construct a machine
       which, when polarized with a negative attraction, will rise from the
       earth and move under the influence of an etheric current at the rate
       of 500 miles an hour, in any given  direction.  This  is,  in  fact,
       Keely's airship.

       Lately, he has applied his force to optics, and by  means  of  three
       wires placed across the lens of a microscope he makes its magnifying
       power equal to that of the great telescope in the Lick observatory -
       the largest in  the  world.  Why don't all astronomers and opticians
       run to look through Keely's microscope,  and  to  examine  into  the
       process?

       Perhaps if Galileo were alive he might express an opinion!


                                      Page 3





       But, the reader  may naturally exclaim, how long has this been going
       on, and we to know nothing about it?  Mr. Keely is now over 60 years
       of age, and he has worked since he was a boy, at times, upon various
       inventions before his discovery of ether.

       For the last  18  years  he  has  been  constantly   employed   with
       experiments upon the  ether;  for  eighteen long years he has worked
       day and night, with hand and brain,  in  the face of discouragements
       that would long ago have killed the owner of a less heroic soul; and
       he has worked almost single handed.

       Slander, ridicule, open accusations of fraud, charlatanry, insanity-
       -- everything evil that it could enter the head of  the knave of the
       heart of the   fool  to  conceive,  every  mean  insinuation,  every
       malicious lie that  prejudice,  bigotry,   ignorance,  self-conceit,
       vested interests, greed, injustice, dishonesty, and  hypocrisy could
       concoct --- these  have  been  the  encouragement which, so far, the
       world has bestowed upon the discoverer of the profoundest truths and
       laws of nature that have ever been  imparted to the profane, or even
       hinted at, outside of the circle of Initiates.

       And now it  has been proved in a hundred ways, and before  thousands
       of persons competent to judge of the merits of his machines, that he
       has really discovered  previously  unknown forces in nature, studied
       them, mastered some of their laws,  invented,  and almost perfected,
       apparatus and machinery that will make his discoveries  of practical
       application in a  hundred ways --- now that he has actually done all
       this, how does the world treat him?

       Does Congress come forward with a  grant  to  enable him to complete
       his marvelous work?  Do  men  of  science  hail   him   as  a  great
       discoverer, or hold  out  the  hand  of fellowship? Do the people do
       honour to the man whose sole entreaty  to  them is to receive at his
       hands a gift  a  thousand  times  more precious to them  than  steam
       engine or telegraph?

       It is a  literal  fact  that  the  world  to-day would tear Keely to
       pieces if it had the power to do so, and if he fell exhausted in the
       terrible struggle he  has  so  long   maintained,   his  failure  to
       establish his claims  would  be received with a shout  of  malignant
       delight from nearly  every lecture hall, pulpit, counting-house, and
       newspaper office in the so-called civilized world!

       The world has hardly ever recognized  its  benefactors, until it has
       become time to raise a statue to their memory; 'in order to beautify
       the town.' Jealousy,  stupidity,  the  malignity which  is  born  of
       conscious inferiority, are  at  this  moment putting in Keely's road
       every impediment which law and injustice can manufacture.

       Two hundred years ago he would have  been burned, a century since he
       would have been probably mobbed to death, but thank  God  we are too
       civilized, too humane  to  burn or mob to death those who make great
       discoveries, who wish to benefit  their  fellow  men, or whose ideas
       are in advance  of  their  age  -  we only break their  hearts  with
       slander, ridicule, and neglect, and when that fails to drive them to
       suicide, we bring  to  bear  upon them the ponderous pressure of the
       law, and heap upon them the peine  forte et dure of injunctions, and
       orders, and suits, to crush them out of a world they  have  had  the
       impertinence to try to improve and the folly to imagine they could

                                      Page 4





       save from suffering   without   paying  in  their  own  persons  the
       inevitable penalty of crucifixion.

       Had it not been for the obligations  incurred  by  Mr. Keely, writes
       Mrs. Bloomfield-Moore in the Philadelphia Inquirer,  of Jan. 20th of
       this year, in  accepting  the  aid  of  the Keely Motor Company - in
       other words, had scientists, instead  of  speculators, furnished him
       with the means  necessary to carry on his 'work of  Evolution,'  the
       secrets which he has so carefully guarded would now have been public
       property, so little does he care personally for financial results.

       As it is,  those  who  have  witnessed  his beautiful experiments in
       acoustics and sympathetic  vibration  were  often  too  ignorant  to
       comprehend their meaning,  and, consequently, even after  expressing
       gratification to him, went away from his workshop to denounce him as
       a Cagliostro, while  others,  competent  to  judge,  have refused to
       witness the production of the ether, as Sir William Thomson and Lord
       Raleigh refused when they were in America a few years since.

       The company here mentioned has been  a  thorn in the inventor's side
       ever since it was organized. It has been bulled and beared by greedy
       speculators, in whose varying interests the American  newspapers for
       years have been worked, the results of which the inventor has had to
       bear.

       For many years  the  Company  has  contributed  nothing  towards Mr.
       Keely's expenses or support, and in  the  opinion of many lawyers it
       is virtually dead. How far it is entitled to his  gratitude  may  be
       gathered from the fact, as stated in Mrs. Bloomfield-Moore's article
       above quoted, that  when  Mr.  Keely  abandoned his old generator of
       etheric force, baffled in his attempts  to  wrest from nature one of
       her most carefully guarded secrets, harassed by his  connection with
       the Keely Motor  Company,  some  of the officers and stockholders of
       which had instituted law proceedings  against  him, which threatened
       him with the  indignity of imprisonment, he destroyed  many  of  his
       marvelous models, and determined that, if taken to prison, it should
       be his dead body and not himself.

       When the history  of  his  discoveries and his inventions come to be
       written there will  be no more pathetic  story  in  the  annuals  of
       genius than that  of  John Worrell Keely. The world  hereafter  will
       find it hard to believe that in the last quarter of the 19th century
       a man with  an  insight  into  the  secret workings of nature, and a
       knowledge of her subtler forces,  which,  whenever  it  is utilized,
       will relieve mankind from much of the grinding toil  that  now makes
       bitter the existence  of  the  vast majority of mortals, that such a
       man should have been left to starve,  because  in  all  the ranks of
       Science there was  not  found  one man capable of understanding  his
       colossal work

              - because  in  all  the ranks of religion there was not found
                one man able to realize  the  enlarged  conception of Deity
                immanent in Keely's great thoughts

              - because  in all the ranks of commerce, of  speculation,  of
                literature, of  art,  there  was  not  found  one man large
                enough, generous enough, unselfish enough, to furnish money
                for a purpose that did not promise an immediate dividend.

       It is to  a  woman,  not  a  man,  that the eternal honour is due of
       having come to Keely's rescue, and  saved  humanity  from  once more
       disgracing itself by doing genius to death with broken-hearted  want
       and neglect.

       That woman's name  will  go down the centuries inseparably connected
       with Keely's discoveries. Probably  no  more  romantic incident ever
       happened in the  history  of  invention than the connection  between
       this wealthy and   large-minded   woman   and   this  slandered  and
       persecuted genius, and no stranger one than the way in which she was
       led, by a series of most unfortuitous events, to offer her aid.

       From that day this lady has been not  only  his benefactor, but also
       his co-worker, trusted  friend,  and courageous defender.  With  the
       exception of his  friend,  those  who  have occupied themselves with
       Keely's discoveries have confined  their attention to its commercial
       value.

       This was to be expected, for Science now is the hand-maid  of trade,
       and Religion has  become  the fawning follower of Science. There is,
       however, a higher  aspect to Keely's  discoveries,  and  that  their
       value as contributions  to  man's  knowledge of Nature  and  natural
       laws.

       So far as  that  is  concerned,  Keely's  success is an accomplished
       fact. His work, explaining his whole  system,  is  now in the Press,
       and were he to die tomorrow he will be just as great a figure in the
       world's history as he would be were a thousand speculators  to clear
       ten million dollars apiece by his inventions.

       Fancy honouring Copernicus or Galileo because the yelping jackals of
       speculation, who were  their  contemporaries, grew fat by feeding on
       their brains!

       Whether Keely's inventions will be  commercial success at present is
       another matter. The force, or, rather forces, which  Keely  handles,
       are the same  as  those known under other names in Occultism, and it
       is the belief of Occultists that these  forces  cannot be introduced
       into the practical  life  of  men,  or  fully  understood   by   the
       uninitiated, until the  world is fit to receive them with benefit to
       itself - until the balance of the  good  and  the  evil they work is
       decidedly on the side of the good.

       Keely himself is persuaded that the world will derive almost unmixed
       benefit from his discoveries; but an Occultist would  prefer  to say
       that inventions and discoveries are disclosed to man, rather than to
       credit genius with  the elaboration of ideas - disclosed, that is to
       say, through the brain of the ostensible  inventor  by  one  of  the
       higher powers that guide the destinies of humanity.

       The discoveries of  Keely  have  an  occult side, which  perhaps  he
       himself may not  fully  perceive,  but  it is upon that side that it
       depends whether those discoveries  themselves  are fitted, by reason
       of sympathetic vibration of a still more inner ether  than Keely has
       publicly spoken of,  to harmonize with the mass chord of our present
       civilization, and manifest in the material life of man.

       Occultists believe that  there are  intelligent  powers  behind  the
       visible things and events of life, which powers alone can say

                                      Page 6





                      "So far shalt thou go, and no further;"

       but they do  not believe that these powers act as a deus ex machina,
       for in themselves they are part of  the natural order of things, and
       act in and through material and immaterial nature.

       We at present in our normal state of consciousness know these powers
       only as forces  and laws, and when we become conscious  of  them  as
       intelligent entities, we   perceive  at  the  same  time  that  they
       themselves are governed by higher wills and intelligences, which act
       through them, as they act through  us,  and are to them their forces
       and their Laws.

       Occultists see in  everything  the  (to us) eternal  action  of  two
       opposing powers or  principles,  which are ever seeking equilibrium,
       and never find it, for behind them  there  is  a  definite  tendency
       towards that which  we  call  progress,  which  tendency  gives  the
       preponderance to one   of   these  powers,  and  thus  prevents  the
       establishment of equilibrium,  in  other  words  of  stagnation  and
       death.

       Now all great discoveries are manifestations of one  of these powers
       or forces only, and, however good in themselves, tend to disturb the
       equilibrium of terrestrial life more than is required for the normal
       rate of universal   progress;   and   therefore   they   produce   a
       disproportion of parts, and the  opposite  power  or  force  gathers
       strength to resist and check the exaggeration.

       Already, in the  estimation  of an ever-growing number  of  thinking
       men, the inventions  and  discoveries  of  the  present century have
       proved themselves a curse rather than a blessing.

       They have raised the world's standard  of  comfort,  and at the same
       time they have lowered the power of purchasing these  very comforts,
       a desire for  which  they have generated. The advantages that accrue
       from steam and from machinery have  not  been  distributed, but have
       become the property of a small minority.

       Year by year competition is becoming fiercer, and labor more arduous
       and continual, and  men  are  growing  more  and  more  like  living
       machines, and the helpless slaves of machinery and of institutions.

       An operative, in  these days of steam power, has less liberty than a
       slave ever had, except in one particular  -  he  has full liberty to
       starve, or to work himself to death, neither of which  privileges an
       owner would allow  him.  Keely, however, thinks his discoveries will
       restore this disturbed equilibrium.

       The direct effect of modern discoveries  and inventions has been the
       rise of the  commercial  and  economic  system; and  the  inevitable
       consequence of that  system  has been to deepen the gulf between the
       poor and the rich.

       The natural effect of this is anantagonism  between the two poles of
       society, which has  its  roots deep down in human nature  and  human
       passions, and this  antagonism  is  becoming  better recognized, and
       growing in intensity, year by year,  in  so  much  that it is almost
       universally felt that the only possible outcome from  it is a social
       overturning, the date of the actual occurrence of which will depend

                                      Page 7





       chiefly upon the activity of the school-boards, and the thoroughness
       of their work.

       Hardly a thinking  man  of  the  present day but foresees, sooner or
       later, a great social cataclysm,  in  which  all  mere political and
       financial considerations will be as straws in a whirlwind.  Now,  it
       would seem that  Keely's  discoveries  tend  to  develop  power over
       material nature in the same direction  in  which that power has been
       growing during the last hundred years.

       If it be  a power into the exercise of which there  enter  no  moral
       considerations whatever, then   it  is  applicable  alike  for  good
       purposes and for evil; and it will  be  as  ready to the hand of the
       bad man as to that of the good.

       Were such inventions  given to the world in their completeness,  the
       whole of the  enormous  power they gave over human life and destines
       would, it would seem, fall into the  possession  of  the  same small
       minority who at present control the power conferred  by  our present
       inventions and discoveries - the capitalists.

       If so, that  section  of the community would then, under our present
       institutions, obtain almost absolute power over the great majority -
       those who depend upon their labor for their support.

       The capitalists who  owned  the  tremendous   powers  implied  in  a
       monopoly of Keely's  inventions  would be practically  the  absolute
       masters of the people; and obedience to their will would be far more
       really, than even  now,  the condition upon which those who were not
       capitalists also would be allowed the means of continued existence.

       Occultists believe that  the  world   is   not  yet  ready  for  the
       appearance of such tremendous forces on the stage of human life.

       Mankind is too  selfish,  too cruel, too stupid, too  pitiless,  too
       animal, to be  entrusted  with  what,  in  sober  reality, are minor
       divine powers.

       Such powers could not at present  be  employed  for  the  benefit of
       mankind and for the advancement of the race; on the  contrary,  they
       would tend to  the  further brutalization and virtual enslavement of
       the poor, and  also  to  the  further   materialization   and  moral
       degradation of One the rich.

       In a word, the human qualities of justice, mercy, love,  generosity,
       unselfishness, have not yet grown strong enough in the race, and the
       animal qualities of   revenge,  anger,  jealousy,  tyranny,  hatred,
       selfishness, are still too powerful  in  man to make the acquisition
       of almost absolute power over nature, and over one another, anything
       but a curse to mankind. It would be less disastrous to give dynamite
       cartridges to monkeys for playthings.

       For this reason  Occultists,  in  general,  do  not  regard  Keely's
       discoveries as likely  to  succeed  in  the commercial sense. And at
       present things have certainly a look that is in accordance with that
       opinion.

       The powers that might be expected  to  intervene in order to prevent
       Keely's inventions from becoming factors in human life, are, as has

                                      Page 8





       been said, through  human  means,  and  the  stolid stupidity of the
       scientists in regard to Keely's discoveries, the bovine indifference
       of theologians, the silly ridicule  of  the  press, the hostility of
       vested interests, the  suicidal  greed  of  some   of   the  largest
       shareholders, and the   paralyzing   influence  of  the  law,  which
       apparently lends itself in this case to those whose object is simple
       robbery.

       All these things  seem  very  like   the  operation  of  the  higher
       controlling powers, acting  with  a  consciousness  other  than  our
       consciousness for the  attainment  of ends that transcend our narrow
       calculations.

       Be this as  it  may, Keely's discoveries,  and  Keely's  personality
       also, have a peculiar interest for Theosophists, for  the force with
       which he is  working  is  without  doubt  the  ether  of the ancient
       philosophers, which is one aspect of the Akasa, the underlying great
       force in nature, according to the  Secret  Doctrine,  a  force whose
       existence has been  recognized  from time immemorial  under  various
       fanciful names, and  whose  property  is  sound,  whether audible or
       inaudible to us; or, in more modern  language, whose characteristics
       are vibration and rhythm.

       It corresponds to  the seven-fold Vach of Hindu Philosophy,  and  is
       the raison d'etre  of  spells  and  Mantrams.   It  is  the basis of
       harmony and melody throughout Nature.  This force is alluded to many
       times in Madame Blavatsky's Isis Unveiled. On page  139,  vol I., we
       read:

            The Akasa  is  a  Sanscrit  word  which  means sky, but it also
            designates the imponderable and intangible life principles, the
            astral and celestial lights combined together, and which t
            wo form the anima mundi, and  constitute the soul and spirit of
            man; the  celestial light forming his nous, pneuma,  or  divine
            spirit, and the other his psyche, soul, or astral spirit.

            The grosser  particles of the latter enter into the fabrication
            of his outward form, the body.  The  Akasa  is connected on the
            one hand with physical matter and on the other  with WILL, that
            intelligent, intangible,  and  powerful  something which reigns
            supreme over all inert matter.


       Of the Akasa in this respect we read  on  page  144, vol,I., of Isis
       Unveiled:

            The mysterious  effects  of  attraction and repulsion  are  the
            unconscious agents  of  that  will; fascination, such as we see
            exercised by  some  animals,   by   serpents  over  birds,  for
            instance, is  a  conscious  action  of it, and  the  result  of
            thought.

            Sealing-wax, glass,  and  amber,  when  rubbed,  i.e., when the
            latent heat  which  exists  in  every  substance  is  awakened,
            attract light  bodies;  they exercise unconsciously  Will;  for
            inorganic as  well  as  organic matter, however infinitesimally
            small it may be, possesses a  particle of the divine essence in
            itself...


                                      Page 9





            What is,  then,  this  inexplicable  power of attraction but an
            atomical portion of that essence  that Scientists and Kabalists
            equally recognize as the 'principle of life' - the Akasa?

            Granted that  the attraction exercised by such  bodies  may  be
            blind; but  as  we ascend higher the scale of organic beings in
            nature, we find this principle  of  life  developing attributes
            and faculties  which  become more determined  and  marked  with
            every rung  of  the  endless  ladder.  Man, the most perfect of
            organized beings on earth, in  whom  matter  and spirit - i.e.,
            Will -are the most developed and powerful, is  alone allowed to
            give a  conscious impulse to that principle which emanates from
            him, and only he can impart to  the magnetic fluid opposite and
            various impulses without limit as to the direction.

       Isis Unveiled was  published nearly eleven years  ago;  and  in  her
       forthcoming work, The  Secret  Doctrine,  the  authoress enters more
       fully into this and other matters  only sketched or hinted at in her
       former volumes.

       It is the  fact  that Keely is working with some of  the  mysterious
       forces included under  the  name  Akasa  that  makes his discoveries
       interesting to Theosophists. It  is  the  fact  that  he  has  shown
       magnificent courage and  fixity  of  purpose  under  every  kind  of
       opposition, and the fact also that he has been supported all through
       by the generous  belief  that his discoveries will be of inestimable
       benefit to mankind that make his personality of interest.

       If he can succeed in making his marvelous discoveries pay dividends,
       science may begin to give attention  to  them;  for  men of science,
       like other men, require a sign before they can accept  as  truth the
       things that are  beyond  their  comprehension,  and  the  value of a
       scientific discovery is now determined by its market value.
