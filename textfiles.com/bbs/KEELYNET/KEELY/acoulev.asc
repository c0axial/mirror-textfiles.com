Well folks, after seeing an "antigravity" sound device presented on CNN
Science news, a few memory cells were stimulated & I dug up an old book.

The book is THE BRIDGE TO INFINITY - HARMONIC 371299 by Bruce Cathe. It was
published in 1983 by Quark Enterprises Limited, 158 Shaw Road, Oratia,
Auckland and Brookfield Press, P.O. Box 1201, Auckland, New Zeland.

This guy may or may not fit the Yorkian mold but due to recent developments I
think what he brought up back then may have some small merit.

I leave it to you to judge and I hope this may stimulate a few threads.
Excerpts from pages 139 - 146:

THE SECRETS OF LEVITATION

A New Zealand scientist recently gave me an intriguing extract from an article
published in a German magazine, relating to a demonstration of levitation in
Tibet. After obtaining a translation by a German journalist, in English, I was
amazed at the information contained in the story, and was surprised that the
article had slipped through the suppression net which tends to keep such
knowledge from leaking out to the public.  All the similar types of stories
that I had read up until now were generally devoid of specific information
necessary to prove the veracity of the account.

In this case a full set of geometric measurements were taken, and I
discovered, to my great delight, that when they were converted into their
equivalent geodetic measures, relating to grid harmonics the values gave a
direct association with those in the unified harmonic equations published in
my earlier works.

The following extracts are translations taken from the German article:

  'We know from the priests of the far east that they were able to lift heavy
   boulders up high mountains with the help of groups of various sounds ..
   The knowledge of the various vibrations in the audio range demonstrates to
   a scientist of physics that a vibrating and condensed sound field can
   nullify the power of gravitation.

   Swedish engineer Olaf Alexanderson wrote about this phenomenon in the
   publication, Implosion No. 13. The following report is based on
   observations which were made only 20 years ago in Tibet. I have this report
   from civil engineer and flight manager, Henry Kjelson, a friend of mine. He
   later on included this report in his book The Lost Techniques. This is his
   report:

   A Swedish doctor, Dr Jarl, a friend of Kjelsons, studied at Oxford.  During
   those times he became friends with a young Tibetan student. A couple of
   years later, it was 1939, Dr Jarl made a journey to Egypt for the English
   Scientific Society. There he was seen by a messenger of his Tibetan friend,
   and urgently requested to come to Tibet to treat a high Lama.

   After Dr Jarl got the leave he followed the messenger and arrived after a
   long journey by plane and Yak caravans, at the monastery, where the old
   Lama and his friend who was now holding a high position were now living.

   Dr Jarl stayed there for some time, and because of his friendship with the
   Tibetans he learned a lot of things that other foreigners had no chance to
   hear about, or observe.   One day his friend took him to a place in the
   neighborhood of the monastery and showed him a sloping meadow which was
   surrounded in the north west by high cliffs.

   In one of the rock walls, at a height of about 250 metres was a big hole
   which looked like the entrance to a cave. In front of this hole there was a
   platform on which the monks were building a rock wall. The only access to
   this platform was from the top of the cliff and the monks lowered
   themselves down with the help of ropes.   In the middle of the meadow,
   about 250 metres from the cliff, was a polished slab of rock with a bowl
   like cavity in the centre.

   The bowl had a diameter of one metre and a depth of 15 centimeters. A block
   of stone was manoeuvred into this cavity by Yak oxen. The block was one
   metre wide and one and one-half metres long. Then 19 musical instruments
   were set in an arc of 90 degrees at a distance of 63 metres from the stone
   slab. The radius of 63 metres was measured out accurately. The musical
   instruments consisted of 13 drums and six trumpets. (Ragdons). Eight drums
   had a cross-section of one metre, and a length of one and one-half metres.

   Four drums were medium size with a cross-section of 0.7 metre and a length
   of one metre. The only small drum had a cross-section of 0.2 metres and a
   length of 0.3 metres. All the trumpets were the same size. They had a
   length of 3.12 metres and an opening of 0.3 metres. The big drums and all
   the trumpets were fixed on mounts which could be adjusted with staffs in
   the direction of the slab of stone. The big drums were made of 3mm thick
   sheet iron, and had a weight of 150 kg. They were built in five sections.

   All the drums were open at one end, while the other end had a bottom of
   metal, on which the monks beat with big leather clubs. Behind each
   instrument was a row of monks. When the stone was in position the monk
   behind the small drum gave a signal to start the concert. The small drum
   had a very sharp sound, and could be heard even with the other instruments
   making a terrible din.

   All the monks were singing and chanting a prayer, slowly increasing the
   tempo of this unbelievable noise. During the first four minutes nothing
   happened, then as the speed of the drumming, and the noise, increased, the
   big stone block started to rock and sway, and suddenly it took off into the
   air with an increasing speed in the direction of the platform in front of
   the cave hole 250 metres high.

   After three minutes of ascent it landed on the platform.   Continuously
   they brought new blocks to the meadow, and the monks using this method,
   transported 5 to 6 blocks per hour on a parabolic flight track
   approximately 500 metres long and 250 metres high. From time to time a
   stone split, and the monks moved the split stones away. Quite an
   unbelievable task. Dr Jarl knew about the hurling of the stones.

   Tibetan experts like Linaver, Spalding and Huc had spoken about it, but
   they had never seen it. So Dr Jarl was the first foreigner who had the
   opportunity to see this remarkable spectacle. Because he had the opinion in
   the beginning that he was the victim  of mass-psychosis he made two films
   of the incident. The films showed exactly the same things that he had
   witnessed.

   The English Society for which Dr Jarl was working confiscated the two films
   and declared them classified.  They will not be released until 1990. This
   action is rather hard to explain, or understand.: End of trans.'

The fact that the films were immediately classified is not very hard to
understand once the given measurements are transposed into their geometric
equivalents. It then becomes evident that the monks in Tibet are fully
conversant with the laws governing the structure of matter, which the
scientists in the modern day western world are now frantically exploring.

It appears, from the calculations, that the prayers being chanted by the monks
did not have any direct bearing on the fact that the stones were levitated
from the ground. The reaction was not initiated by the religious fervour of
the group, but by the superior scientific knowledge held by the high priests.

The secret is in the geometric placement of the musical instruments in
relation to the stones to be levitated, and the harmonic tuning of the drums
and trumpets. The combined loud chanting of the priests, using their voices at
a certain pitch and rhythm most probably adds to the combined effect, but the
subject matter of the chant, I believe, would be of no consequence.

The sound waves being generated by the combination were directed in such a way
that an anti-gravitational effect was created at the centre of focus (position
of the stones) and around the periphery, or the arc, of a third of a circle
through which the stones moved.   If we analyse the diagram published with the
original article, then compare it with the modified diagram, we become aware
of the following coordinates, and the implications, when compared with my
previously published works.

The distance between the stone block and the central pivot of the drum
supports is shown as 63 metres. The large drums were said to be one and one
half metres long, so the distance from the block to the rear face of each drum
could be close to 63.75 metres considering that the pivot point would be near
the centre of balance. My theoretical analysis, by calculator, indicates that
the exact distance would be 63.7079 metres for the optimum harmonic reaction.
I believe that there is not much doubt that the Tibetans had possession of the
secrets relating to the geometric structure of matter, and the methods of'
manipulating the harmonic values, but if we can grasp the mathematical theory
behind the incident, and extend the application, then an even more fascinating
idea presents itself.    In my last book I mentioned the flying machines
described in ancient records, that flew through the air with a melodious
sound, and theorised that the sonic apparatus was tuned to the hal-monic
unified equations.

Now the Tibetans have given us a direct indication of how to construct a sonic
propelled anti-gravitational flying machine. All that is necessary is to
complete the circle of sonic generators, indicated by the drums, trumpets,
etc., and we have a disc which creates an anti-gravitational lifting force at
the centre. From this it would appear that a vehicle could be constructed that
would resonate at frequencies in sympathy with the unified fields demonstrated
throughout this work.

It is my opinion that our own scientific establishments are far ahead in this
type of research, and that many experimental vehicles have already been
constructed. High frequency generators have probably taken the place of the
low frequency sonic methods, and electronic systems produced which would allow
complete control of movement.   With this type of research going on, I would
say that the days of the conventional aeroplane are numbered. "
