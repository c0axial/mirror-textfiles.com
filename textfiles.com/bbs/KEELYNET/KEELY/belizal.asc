The following file was sent to KeelyNet after the author read of the work of
Chuck Shramek who developed a technique to view the aura by using a microwave
stimulated Tesla coil.  The file is called AURAVIEW.ZIP and includes pictures
and a simplified description of the device.

 Hi From Montreal

 First of all, I want to offer you my excuses for my english which is not as
good as I want it to be,in the hope that it will not interfere for this and (I
hope) our following letters....

 It is very difficult for me to discribe the amazement who struck me when I
read about your researches, they look a lot like some of the researches that I
was doing myself, not on the aspect of the picturization of orgone but on the
evidences of the knowledge of the egyptians about the orgone energies.....

 To discribe myself a little, I am an acupuncturist for about 7 years now,I
have also learned Homeopathie and I was looking for more information about the
energies which are supposed to sustain life, that is when I got my first
contacts with Reich`s discoveries....on my way of better understanding, I have
also learned about what in french we call `ondes de formes` or wave formes....
knowing that none of the books are translated in english,I will try in a short
letter, for the benifit of your researches,to explain the theories behind these
wave formes...

 The wave forme is the child of radiesthesia (pendulums...). The inventors,
more the discoverers, Belizade & Chaumerie were two french scientifique who had
knowledge of radiesthesia, with the help of pendulum, they were on the research
of waves which were not yet, around 1920, discovered or detected by the
scientifique instrumentations.

They based there researches on the empirical but important knowledge of
geobiologie, the knowledge that permit one to find water sources or energetique
earth nodes (presently, as you know, identifiable by very specialized and
sensitive instruments).  They found out that the shapes emitted waves also and
they named them `ondes de formes` or wave forme; from that knowledge they found
out that the wave forme explained a lot of the mysteries of the civilisations
who preceded us be they; easter island statues, the cathedrals, the dolmens,
the nazca drawings and of course the pyramids, the knowledge, for the two
scientists, of the wave forme by the egyptieas is without any doubts, by the
fact they found a pendulum in a tomb....

They passed the rest of there lives attempting to classify those waves, they
classified them by an equivalent color, they even found waves emitted by shape
which did not have a visible equivalent as the dreadful negative green, the
shortest of all known waves...

 Here is a small translation of a part of one of the book concerning the
knowledge of the egyptians:

   THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS AND THE WAVE FORMES

 The wave formes were known and used by the egyptians, who possessed a
knowledge for which we have yet to find the key, but we track the effects of
the emissions of the geometrique forme they were mastering....

 ....The wave forme were used for different needs of the epoque like the
mummification of the body, protections of the tombs, orientations,
transmutations and communications, even if the hertzian wave were not known at
the time.

 The hieroglyphes, by there diversity of forme of expressions, seem to have,
been inspired by the knowledge of the wave forme : in the phonetique sense and
figuratively, vulgar, ideological and the religious sense.  The egyptians
certainly knew about radiesthesia because of the discovry of a gres pendulum in
a tomb......

We also possess a ring (this is the famous ring of the curse of the pharaoh,
which was at one time the property of Belizade) in gres too, which was probably
used by it`s possessor to protect him temporarily from some nocivite of the
shape without the need to use the ankh for protection.

 The geometrique composition of the shape of the ring was used to create a
vibratory compasitor (comparator or capacitor??) of nocive wave, a very good
one.....

 They also published a whole book only on their discoveries about the egyptians
shapes and created theories which they used to produce machines for healing
people or balancing the energetique earthnode....after their death a lot of
radiesthetists continued their researches and made new discoveries like the
potential of the hebrew alphabet as a shape, the emission of the easter island
statue and the potential of the shape that the locals used for protections.

 It is a shame that I don't have a scanner to send you the picture of the
different emissions of the egyptian shapes and how the egyptians used their
knowledge to protect there tombs.....

 Here is an experience they made to prove the possibility of communication only
by wave forme....maybe if you are able to get a picture of an unliving thing
you can repeat it with picture....

 Knowing that a part of a sheet of paper keeps an energetique link with the
whole sheet;they put two parts of a same sheet under two different pyramids
(anything that emits negative green can do the same thing by the way) one paper
by the pyramid and placed them at more then 15 kilometers of distance...they
charge eneregetically one pyramid and they found out that the other pyramid was
showing THE SAME CHARGE...

They began to make an alphabet out of the color of the energies and began to
comunicate messages...of course the phone (or the bbs:-) is much faster but by
that they proved that the egyptians had the need and the possibility to
comunicate over long distances (they made the same test from Paris and
Melbourne) they found too in an egyptian museum a strange furniture which was
found to be perfect for the emission and reception of messages...so the
possibility that the egyptians communicate by the use of these wave formes or
wave shapes is not impossible....

 When I read about the researches (of Chuck Shramek), being an acupuncturiste,
I had to ask why we only see the indian chakras..in the Chinese medicine those
are only other points like the 365 others...did you ever get pictures of a lot
more chakras all around the body?

 Did you ever think of combining a cloud buster with a tesla `emitter`? (hoping
it will not transform the emissions into a death ray machine:-))

 Did you think of making a picture of a person having a Reiki treatment, I`m
sure it would show the difference of before and after ?

 Maybe you would be able to do a picture of orgone energie around an object if
you ask a Reiki practitioner friend to charge it by hand before the picture?

 Anyway that`s about what I had to give to you hoping that it doesn`t bother
you and it might be of help to you ....if you have the time please send me a
little more information on your own researches or those of others which tie in
with this subject, maybe I will be able to help you.

 It has been a pleasure communicating with you and those on KeelyNet:-)

                                                Eric Duchaine D ac;N.D

 P.s  Just send the response through KeelyNet, I`m sure that Jerry will pass it
      to me, the first part of the book gives fairly comprehensive knowledge of
      the wave forme expressions, perhaps I can post some of this for other
      researchers.
