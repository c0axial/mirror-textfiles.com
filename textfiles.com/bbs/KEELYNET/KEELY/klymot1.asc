       This was a  short  story  that  was  in a book called `Stranger Than
       Science'. The book was written by  Frank  Edwards. There was no date
       as to when  the  book  was written. It appears as if  the  book  was
       written in the early 1960's. Also the author did not give the source
       of his                                                  information.

                            JOHN KEELY'S MYSTERY MOTOR

       The Powerful engine shook the building ... but it shook the existing
       understanding of energy even harder.

       Twenty-three men were crowded into  the same small room which housed
       the controversial motor.  Many of them were engineers,  others  were
       professional men or  bankers - and all of them were investors.  They
       were skeptics, too; and they had waited years for John Keely to make
       good on his claims.

       Time after time  they  had  poured  their  money  into  his  endless
       research and profitless  development of the engine  that  now  stood
       before them. Today  he  had promised them that he would show what it
       could do. Was he fraud or genius? They should soon know.

       John Keely never even glanced at the  hard faces of the men who were
       packed into the room with him and his engine. If  he  was  aware  of
       their presence he  gave  no hint - just as he apparently ignored the
       ear-shattering noise that was rattling the small window panes.

       From the heavy steel machine, bolted to the massive stone base, came
       the screech of metal in travail. A  deep hum changed to a moan - the
       moan to a whine.  Wilder danced the window frames -  as  though they
       were eager to flee this unearthly din.

       Keely knew he was master of the situation, because he, and he alone,
       was master of  the  machine  before them. These irate investors were
       demanding proof that their money had gone into something practical?

       Very well-they would soon have their  proof!  He  lightly  tapped  a
       button, and the roar jarred the bones of every man present.

       When the faint  blue fog cleared away, the committee  members  could
       see that the  one-inch  lead ball had been expelled from the machine
       with such incredible force that it  had  shot completely through two
       heavy oak planks and buried itself in a sandbox against the wall.

       Most Impressive, the committee agreed; but when could they expect to
       put this latent power to work in a fashion that would  reimburse the
       stockholders?

       For John Keely  this  session  with  the  stockholders' committee in
       November 1879 was an old, old story. He gave them performance - they
       insisted on profits. Over and over  again,  as the stockholders came
       and went, he endured their criticism and calumny.

       Through the years of ambivalence that surged about  him,  John Keely
       never lost his  temper.  Neither did he lose his ability to find new
       financial backers to replace those who had given and gone.

       For a mechanical inventive genius, John had an unusual background.

       Born in Philadelphia in 1827, he worked as a carpenter, a violinist,
       a magician who specialized in card tricks; and finally he trudged to
       the Rocky Mountains as a trapper.  Badly wounded by an Indian arrow,
       he mode his way back to Philadelphia and eventually  recovered  from
       the wound.

       It was an age when the need for controllable power was great.  Water
       power could not  meet  the  demands of growing industry. Steam power
       was not the answer - there must be  some  new cheap source of energy
       that could be  harnessed  to  turn  the  wheels  of  the  mills  and
       factories.

       John Keely first attracted attention by announcing, in 1871, that he
       had tapped a  great  new  source  of  energy  -  as  he  put it with
       exasperating vagueness - "a device  which  disintegrates the etheric
       force that controls  the  atomic  constitution  of   matter."   Some
       scientists challenged him,  some ignored him - all were skeptical of
       him.

       Keely claimed that his engine operated on "harmonic vibrations." His
       detractors promptly retorted that  the motivating force was hot air,
       generated by Mr. Keely.

       Whatever it was, it had enough power to bend steel rails and to tear
       giant hawsers into shreds, a force beyond anything  in common use at
       the time.

       In December, 1882,  the  angry investors demanded a showdown...  and
       got it. Keely agred to reveal the  secret  of  his mystery motor to
       any scientist the  committee  named. They selected  Edward  Bakel...
       who saw and was convinced.

       He reported to   the  unhappy  investors  that,  while  he  did  not
       understand all that he had seen, he  understood  enough to know that
       Keely had discovered all he had claimed.

       Keely's luck ran out in 1888, and the stockholders  had  him sent to
       jail for ignoring  a  court  order  to  reveal his secret. A wealthy
       widow financed him for the next ten years, to the end of his life in
       1898.

       The stockholders wrecked his shop,  finally  came  upon a huge steel
       ball which contained  compressed  air. There was nothing  new  about
       that; for Keely  had  often  shown the sphere to interested parties,
       and its pipes were inadequate to  have  operated  at  the  pressures
       indicated by the performance of the machine.

       Vangard Notes >>>

           This steel  sphere weighed over 6000 pounds and was buried under
           the floor of Keely's lab.  The  fact that it was in such a place
           and obviously had compressed air led many to believe  this to be
           the force which Keely used in his demonstrations.

           Other accusers of fraud have specified hydraulics in the form of
           water to  create  Keely's  force.   That  force  is said to have
           reached upward  of  30,000  PSI   and  this  achieved  from  the
           dissociation of 3 to 6 drops of water.

           If Keely could create such tremendous pressures using either air
           or hydraulics, he would have been a millionaire many times over.

           The interesting thing about all his detractors  is  that  NO ONE
           could even begin to duplicate his demonstrations using ANY KNOWN
           principle of physics at that time.

           Our researches indicate that the sphere was used by Keely in his
           early days  as  a holder for the etheric force which took on the
           form of a highly compressible  vapor.   Refer  to other files in
           the file  9 section for more information relating  to  this  and
           other Keely information.

           One of  the most disgusting things about the Keely literature is
           how all the vultures descended  on  his lab ONLY AFTER HIS DEATH
           to find  what they were sure was fraud.  No credible  scientists
           would investigate  him  during  his  life,  nor endorse his work
           publicly.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       The secret of Keely's mystery motor died with him.  Scientists could
       never agree on how it had operated. The witnesses agreed on only one
       thing; the engine made a humming sound.

       The question remains: Were they hearing  the  birth pangs of a great
       discovery ...  or merely the persuasive hum of a humbug?
