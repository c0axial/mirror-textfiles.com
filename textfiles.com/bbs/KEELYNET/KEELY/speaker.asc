                              ACOUSTIC RADIATION TEST
                             USING AND ELECTRIC GUITAR

       Acoustical radiation forces have been shown to be able to levitate
       objects. The utilization of this force for the purpose of levitation
       is primarily dependent on the lower frequency sonics in a longitude
       mode; they provide a lifting force in the form of pressure wave
       harmonics.

       As shown in Figure 1, when the first fret E-chord on a guitar was
       struck through a distortion amplifier a state of motion was induced
       and minimal levitation sustained for up to 5 seconds at
       approximately 25 watts.

       Higher frequency chords gave only vibrational responses.  The
       distorted oscillation of the guitar strings can induce propulsion
       due to the pulse of many sonic waves set in motion.

       In one test, shown in Figure 2, we proved that the harmonic
       frequencies of a guitar can indeed lift a speaker as high as a
       centimeter above the ground.

       We have also discovered that the lower the frequency notes, less
       amplification was required to sustain levitation.  This suggests
       that levels below hearing in the 30 Hz range may produce the
       greatest results at lower amplification.

       On a flat surface, motion usually goes in the direction of highest
       weight offset. The weight tilts the speaker to change the direction
       of pressure force.  In order to gain sufficient lift, high
       amplification is required. I am unable to conduct adequate
       experimentation due to the overheating of speaker coils!  No
       complete analysis of the situation has been preformed.
