                               The Keely Motor Fraud

       Ever since the death of John W. Keely, the fantastical collection of
       apparatus with which   he   puzzled  the  public,  and  incidentally
       diverted a golden  stream  into  his  private  purse,  has  been  as
       jealously guarded as ever it was in his lifetime.

       Recently the motor was removed, and the laboratory  (Heaven save the
       mark!) in which  for a quarter of a century he had conducted his so-
       called experiments was vacated.   Whereupon  Mr.  Clarence B. Moore,
       whose mother had  been  the most generous of Keely's  many  victims,
       rented the premises, and calling to his assistance several gentlemen
       of high standing  in the scientific world (some of whom, by the way,
       had been baffled witnesses of the  Keely  phenomena),  proceeded  to
       explore the premises in search of evidences of fraud.

       The result proves not merely that the motor was a fraud, but that it
       was a fraud, as we pointed out fifteen years ago in  the  columns of
       this journal, of  the  very  simplest  and most transparent kind; in
       fact, the presumption is strong that  this  most  colossal humbug of
       the century depended  for its success upon that ever-fruitful  theme
       of the bogus company promoter - compressed air.

       In the first  place,  hidden  beneath  the floor of the building was
       found a large and massive metal sphere,  whose  weight  is  given as
       three tons, and whose bursting strength under pressure  is stated to
       be so many tons to the square inch.

       Apparently at one  time connected with this was found, hidden in the
       brick wall, a quantity of small brass  tubing,  of just the size and
       strength to match   the   strength  of  the  steel  reservoir,   and
       corresponding to the  tubing used by Keely in his various public and
       private exhibitions.

       Underneath the upper floor of the  house  was found a false ceiling,
       well calculated to  hide  the  necessary  tubes  for  conveying  the
       compressed air to  the  different  air motors with which he produced
       his results; while a number of trap-doors  were found scattered over
       the floor of  this stage, from which, for a quarter  of  a  century,
       this prince of humbugs played his part!

       Many of our  older  readers  will  remember that from the very first
       this journal was emphatic in its opposition  to the Keely mania, and
       endeavored, we think, with considerable success,  to  check,  if  it
       could not wholly prevent, such obvious swindling of the public.
                  (they could NOT have been wrong, of course...)

       We pointed out  that  all  of the results obtained by Keely could be
       duplicated by using compressed air  in  suitable  apparatus,  and in
       1884, in the  case  of  the  Keely gun, conducted experiments  which
       proved that IN THIS CASE, at least, we were correct.

       Keely had many  different  names for his newly discovered force, and
       just at the time of the famous gun experiments at Sandy Hook, he was
       pleased to call it "etheric vapor."  Representatives of this journal
       were present on  the occasion, and  the  accompanying  illustrations
       were publised in  the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN of October  11,  1884,  in
       connection with an  article  exposing  the  trick by which the Keely
       Motor Company was able, in a single  day,  to send up its stock from
       nine cents on the dollar to fifteen cents, and swell  its  own  bank
       account proportionately.

       The "vaporic" gun used on that occasion (it was nothing more or less
       than an air-gun)  had  a  spherical knob secured to the breech, from
       which projected a "vibrator".  The  breech was 4 1/2 inches external
       diameter, the bore 1 1/8 inches and the total length was 3 1/2 feet.

       Just forward of the trunnion the muzzle unscrewed, this construction
       being adopted to permit the placing of a gas check  in  position.  A
       sleeve with a  bore  equal  to  that  of  the  gun, was fitted in an
       annular recess in the forward part of the breech.

       It will be seen that when the muzzle  was  screwed  home, the sleeve
       was formed in  until  it held the gas check firmly  in  place.   The
       latter consisted of  three  disks, having a common diameter of 1 5/8
       inches.

       The two front  disks  were  of common  hard  rubber,  1/32  inch  in
       thickness, while the  third  disk,  which  was placed  next  to  the
       pressure chamber, was  of soft rubber packing, 1/16 inch thick.  The
       disks were shown before and after  firing.   It will be noticed that
       the broken disk shows clearly the imprint made by  the  end  of  the
       sleeve.

       The bore of  the  gun was 1 1/8 inch and a spherical lead bullet was
       used.  A copper tube 3/16 inch in  external  diameter  and 1/16 inch
       internal diameter, led the breech of the gun to the  magazine, which
       was made of wrought iron and was 8 1/2 inches external diameter by 4
       1/2 feet long.

       Another tube was  connected  by  a  wire  to a second magazine.  The
       supply from the  small to the large  magazine  and  from  the  large
       magazine to the gun was controlled by stop valves.

       These magazines, according  to  Mr.  Keely,  had been  charged  with
       "interatomic ether," which  had been evolved by a "generator" set up
       in Mr. Keely's Philadelphia workshop.

       In loading the gun the gas check  was  first  placed in position and
       the muzzle screwed up tightly; then the bass was introduced at the

                                      Page 2





       muzzle and rammed home.

       Next the stop-cock  was  opened  to admit the "etheric vapor" to the
       breech, and, after waiting a few seconds,  the "vibrator" was STRUCK
       WITH A WOODEN MALLET, and the charge exploded, driving the bullet at
       a target 500 yards from the gun.

       Nineteen rounds were  fired,  and  then a conical steel  bullet  was
       driven through 4  inches  of  pine  plank placed a few feet from the
       gun.

       The noise of discharge closely resembled  that  caused  by  a common
       shotgun when loose powder having no ramming upon it  is exploded.  A
       small cloud of  white vapor, which immediately diasppeared, followed
       in the discharge.

       The velocities of three consecutive  shots  were  482, 492, 523 feet
       per second.

       "The gun was  then unscrewed," says the account of the  proceedings,
       "the valve at  the  magazine was opened, and visitors were permitted
       to examine the 'interatomic ether'  as  it issued from the pipe.  It
       had but a small trace of odor, no taste, and had no  effect upon the
       lungs."

       Precisely; for there  is  not  a  question in the world but what the
       "interatomic ether" as it issued from the pipe was the common air at
       atmospheric pressure.

       We declared at the time that the  magazine  had  been  charged  with
       compressed air at many thousand pounds pressure, and  that  when the
       stopcock was opened,  the  air,  owing  to its high pressure, passed
       rapidly to the breech, behind the  gas  check,  where  it  developed
       sufficient pressure to burst the check and expel the ball.

       The tapping on the "resonator" had nothing whatever  to  do with the
       discharge, and was  merely one of the charlatan "passes of the wand"
       by which this accomplished rogue bewildered his audience.

       To prove the fact to his satisfaction,  the  representative  of  the
       SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN requested  Keely  to  allow him  to  handle  the
       wooden mallet (his  purpose  being  to delay the tapping until after
       the discharge).  It is needless to say that Keely refused.

       Soon after Keely's  gun  experiments  the  editor  of  this  journal
       conducted experiments in  the  same direction in New  York,  and  an
       experimental gun was  made  of  seamless  drawn brass pipe of 1 inch
       bore and 2 feet in length, and set vertically under a skylight shaft
       several storeis in height.

       A union joint was screwed to the  bottom  of  the  pipe, with a pipe
       connecting to a  coil of about 100 feet of 1 1/4 inch  pipe,  placed
       beneath the gun.

       A further connection was made with a hydraulic testing pump and high
       pressure gage.  In  the  union  joint  were placed two disks of hard
       rubber, each about 1/32 of an inch in thickness, and above the disks
       a lead ball, 1 inch in diameter, was placed.


                                      Page 3





       On the railing  of  the  next  story above was laid a target of five
       tiers of 1 1/4 inch plank, directly  over the range of the gun.  The
       whole pipe being full of air at atmospheric pressure,  the  pump was
       put in operation,  water being forced into the lower end of the pipe
       reservoir.

       This forced the air up through the pipe line and compressed it under
       the hard rubber disks.  When a pressure  of  1,500 pounds per square
       inch was reached, the disks ruptured and the gun was discharged.

       The bullet passed through the 6 1/4 inches of pine  planks, making a
       clean cut through   the   first  planks  and  badly  shattering  and
       displacing the last plank of the target,  then struck and splintered
       a beam under the roof and rebounded to the floor.

       This was repeated several times, the disks bursting at between 1,300
       and 1,500 pounds  and showing the great power of compressed  air  in
       the discharge of the projectiles.

       The prestidigitator part  of  Keely's exceedingly small feed pipe to
       the chamber behind the disks and  bullet,  and  his bogus tapping of
       the resonator, it  is  needless  to  say were not  included  in  our
       experiment.

       In conclusion we  would  remind  our  readers that the death of this
       prince of rogues does not imply that  the  type is extinct; and that
       "resonators," "vibrators," "etheric vapors," and others of that ilk,
       still walk the  earth dressed in the ever-varying  garb  with  which
       such human sharks as Keely are still seeking to catch the unwary.

       Vangard notes...

            Though there  are  some  who  think  we  should  NOT  list such
            derogatory articles regarding  Keely,  we  must  do  so  in the
            interest of fair play, especially since they come from the same
            time period.

            Also note  that the "duplication" of Keely's  demonstration  by
            Scientific American   DID  NOT  faithfully  duplicate  or  even
            emulate the original demonstration.  Keely DID NOT USE WATER OR
            ANY OUTSIDE FORCE as did Sci.Amer.   An example that one should
            not take a stand early in the game as errors do compound.

            For those who take the time to study the work  and  concepts of
            Keely, especially   in   comparison   to  modern  science,  the
            analogies are obvious and stimulating.
