The saser is, for now, only in research.  They use an inch long piece of glass
chilled to almost absolute zero, to eliminate vibrations.  The sound they
amplified was at 340 Mhz, and it aplified at about 50%.  The article also
talks about using the device to search for Dark Matter.

In talking about the aplication of using the device for the search for Dark
Matter the article says "A dark-matter particle entering a piece of ordinary
solid matter might, on rare occasion, hit an atom, make it vibrate, and create
a faint sound." It then implies that the Saser could be used for this task.
So what does that mean <g>?

Vanguard Note..

  Does anyone remember the 'weirding module' that was used in the movie DUNE?
  When the troops were being given their first demonstration of the device, it
  was explained that all masses have a resonant frequency, that organs such as
  heart, liver, lungs, etc. could be exploded when subjected to an amplified
  and sustained frequency resonant to their mass.  That frequency was produced
  by the human voice and the 'signature' was in the form of words or sounds
  which particularly effected certain masses.  Some of which resulted in great
  physical damage to the point of explosions.

  It was always of interest because a trained human voice has a wonderful
  range that can be used to harmonically tune to any mass.  There are reports
  that the ancient Egyptians and other cultures (particularly the priests) had
  schools which allowed the priests to develop their voices for full control.
  The Egyptian priests were also said to have deep, reverberant voices.

  The Eastern Indians also used such 'signatures' in the form of mantras, and
  Vedic literature has many references to such 'acoustic geometries' which
  could be employed to evoke responses in mass.

  Molecular frequencies have also been used in an amplified cavity to produce
  a 'maser'.  Ammonia and other molecules could be amplified to produce the
  resonant pattern in a reinforced condition resulting in odd effects when
  directed at certain masses.

  A PBS special once showed a short segment of a military test using a maser.
  This one was tuned to iron (ferrous or ferric oxide, I don't remember which)
  as its masing source.  It was directed over a distance of about a mile at a
  steel plate something like twelve inches thick by 6 feet wide and 4 feet
  high.

  The maser was 'adjusted' (probably through phase matching) to establish
  resonance with the iron (ferrous oxide) in the target.  In a matter of
  seconds, the entire steel plate EXPLODED into pieces.

  The principle was NOT just the intensity of the maser, but tuning to the
  resonant frequency of the iron, which by the way, does not occur in nature
  as an element but joins with oxygen and other substances to form various
  molecules, thus making it possible to use the maser to destroy the steel
  plate, just like the wine glass being exploded by voice.  Perhaps this sheer
  destructive force is one reason you don't hear a lot about MASERS.

  According to Keely, the PHONON migration as mentioned in the file can be
  accelerated and NATURALLY AMPLIFIED by tuning the mass structure through the
  process Keely calls 'differentiation'.  That is the removal of 'knots' that
  produce resistance to the flows of force through a mass.  Once a mass has
  been 'differentiated', it is then considered to be harmonically adjusted and
  subject to manipulation of its internal energy flows.

  Super-conductivity and resonance are both LEVELS OF ORDER established in a
  mass which emulate this 'differentiation' process.

  A sample of this month's (October) Roundtable mailout is provided so you can
  see how this would be applied to the real world to produce effects that we
  can use practically.

                 Notice of Vanguard Sciences Roundtable Meeting

Greetings!  This is your reminder for our 24th meeting of the Roundtable.  Can
you believe as of October, 94' this will be two years of monthly meetings?

Something really amazing seems to be congealing in the minds of many people
with whom we all have been in contact or read about.  It relates to what
appears to be a Universal Principle manifesting in nature as a CYCLOID.
KeelyNet has long promoted the idea that geometry, frequency and spin are key
elements necessary to achieve much of the phenomena we are trying to qualify
and eventually quantify through a working and reproducible device.

Victor Schauberger proved the Cycloid form was most easily created by use of
an egg shaped flow pattern.  Rudolph Steiner also said the heart shaped flow
produced an inflowing, life-giving rotation which nature used when building
new life, healing or accumulating energy.  The life-enhancing effects can be
augmented by using magnets, crystals, copper and other elements in the right
combinations.  Now, there have arisen numerous correlations in the field of
inertial and gyroscopic drives from researchers such as Dean, Cook,
Laithwaite, Kidd and Thornsen among others.

One must realize that there is a difference between an inertial drive such as
promoted by Dean, Cook and Thornsen and the precession effects of gyroscopic
drives as investigated by Laithwaite and Kidd.  In the case of inertial
drives, the ideal system involves the creation of a cycloid motion, currently
achieved by a complex mechanical rotation of one or more spinning weights.

The simplest form is a spring with a weight attached to the end of it and
mounted on a rotating disk.  You can see how the weighted spring can be
released at the same point in the rotation of the disk to give a hopping
action in a single preferred direction.

The spring slowly pulls the weight closer to the shaft as the disk spins away
from the direction of the hopping motion, this allows the spring to 'recharge'
during each rotation.  The device then moves in short hops only in one
preferred direction through the inertia of the moving weight when it is
released at the same point during the disk rotation.

In the case for gyroscopic precession, a perpendicular motion in relation to
the angular spin of the gyroscope will also produce a lifting force against
the weight of the gyroscope.  The claims are that weight is not eliminated but
reduced from its norm.  It is felt that further research along this line will
yield a levitating device.

But the reason I'm writing about this, is because of a fascinating discovery
made in Russia by Alexander Chernetski and tentatively called the PLASMATRON.
(Refer PLASMAFE.ASC on KeelyNet)  In our past meetings we have discussed
MagnetoHydroDynamics (MHD) and the possibilities it presented as an over-unity
device.  An ionized gas that was 'supercharged' with high density magnetic
flux seems to exhibit certain properties which Chernetskii claims to take
advantage of.  His description of the process;

 "The self-generating discharge (SGD) emerges when the discharge current
  reaches a definite critical density, when the magnetic fields they create
  ensure magnetisation of plasma electrons and they begin to perform MOSTLY
  CYCLOID movements.  The interaction of currents with their magnetic fields
  forces the electrons to deviate to the cylinder-shaped discharge axis and
  the electrical field emerges.  It has proved to 'switch on' the physical
  vacuum; in this field the vacuum is polarized and consequently the virtual
  pairs begin to move IN A DEFINITE DIRECTION, instead of chaotically.  The
  current in the circuit builds up and additional energy is discharged on the
  resistor (that is) switched into the discharge circuit (load).  Clearly,
  only part of the tremendous vacuum energy is extracted."

Note if you will, once the cycloid pattern is achieved, a specific direction
of thrust is generated to force all loose electrons to be thrown off at
whatever happens to be in its path, in the Chernetskii case, an energy
collector absorbs the energy and then switches out the excess energy to a
load, such as a motor, light bulb or other device that performs a useful
service.  So, this is the same process as the inertial drive, except instead
of using the rotation of a MECHANICAL part, we are using the spinning of the
plasma, and instead of a weight, we are using a magnetic flux of a CRITICAL
DENSITY.

John Keely referred to the use of an apsidal motion as a means of crude
propulsion as far back as 1893 and used it to PROPEL his airship in a
demonstration to the War Department in 1896.  Levitation is one thing,
propulsion is quite another.  Once you understand how the cycloid motion can
be used in any rotating mass to produce a linear thrust, you can then extend
it into microscopic reaches to help explain phenomena that borders on magic.

Are not all molecules made up of atoms?  And are those atoms not in turn made
up of electrons spinning around a heavier nucleus?  So, if you could put a
dimple in the orbit of the electron in such a way that it would produce a
minute off balance thrust, you would get a slight deflection as if you pinched
a watermelon seed between your finger and it shot out.  Of course, the amount
of deflection will be very slight but can be amplified by adding to the
'weight' of the electron by increasing it's density.  When it is released at
the maximum eccentric position of the orbit, an inertial thrust is produced.

Keely said that a mass could be differentiated and essentially tuned so that
all components of it would become harmonized to each other.  Once this was
done, they all act as little tuning forks.  Because they are so tuned, you can
change the rotation or properties of one and THEY ALL CHANGE simultaneously.
Thus, you could dimple one electron and all others would also dimple IN THE
SAME DIRECTION to produce a MASS THRUST.  You then have a way of moving mass
without needing a transmission, something to react against or any visible
means of driving it beyond the circuitry necessary to create the effect.  This
could lead to all kinds of new technologies if it could be realized as a prime
mover.  As you can see, the applications of the cycloid motion are manifold
and ripe for further research.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The above mailer is part of what was sent out for this month's meeting
  topic.  Norman Wooten brought over an article several months ago detailing
  experiments carried out by both Cook and Thornsen.  We then were fortunate
  to meet both of them and witness a videotape made by Thornsen showing a
  plywood box powering a canoe across a body of water at a speed of 87 feet
  per minute, and purely through the inertial drive effect.  An amazing thing
  to witness.

  But I won't drone on, it must mean something because Bert's PHONON article
  leads to so many other correlations.  As usual, we here at KeelyNet would
  appreciate any information you might wish to share on this or other such
  interesting aspects of science.
