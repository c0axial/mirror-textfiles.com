                   Could sonoluminescence be related to the work
                       done by Keely on dissociation of H2O?

                        FLASHES MIGHT YIELD CLUES ABOUT FUSION

       Mysterious flashes of blue light  may  illuminate  a  new way to tap
       nuclear energy, two physicists suggest.

       When sound waves  are transmitted through a liquid,  they  create  a
       trail of microscopic bubbles.  As early as 1929, scientists reported
       that at unpredictable  times, they would occasionally see mysterious
       flashes of blue  light,  called  sonoluminescence,   when  the  tiny
       bubbles collapsed.

       Last year, University  of  Mississippi  scientists  learned  how  to
       repeatedly get flashes  from  single bubbles.  Now, the blue flashes
       are being measured by physicist Seth  J.  Putterman and his graduate
       student, Bradley P.   Barber, at the University of  California,  Los
       Angeles.  Their apparatus,  a spherical flask with a sonic generator
       attached, costs only a few hundred dollars.

       The results, which they reported  in  Nature,  are surprising.  They
       found that what  appears  to the eye as one flash is  actually  many
       flashes, each lasting only 100 trillionths of a second and occurring
       with clock-like regularity every 100 millionths of a second. (10,000
       Hz)

       Even more surprising,   says   Dr.   Putterman,   are   the   energy
       implications of such quick light  pulses.   A  photon  of blue light
       given off by a single atom carries an energy of 3.5  electron volts.
       This is a  trillion  times  more  energy than any single atom in the
       tiny bubbles could have gained from  the sound waves.  He speculates
       that as each  bubble  implodes to about 1/100,000  of  its  original
       volume, the energy  and  atoms  in  the bubble are concentrated to a
       tiny point.

       The flash occurs when a million atoms  simultaneously  release  this
       concentrated energy by giving off photons of blue light.

       This split-second concentration of energy in the collapsing bubbles

       may be producing  the  temperatures  and  pressures  needed  for the
       thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen  atoms,  the  nuclear reaction that
       powers the  sun.   If  scientists could understand sonoluminescence,
       they might have  clues  to new ways to trigger thermonuclear fusion,
       he suggests.

       Vangard note...

             Keely claimed that water could  be  dissociated at 42,800 CPS.
             From what little description there is available,  we cannot be
             sure if  this  is  simple  hydrolysis or the production of the
             tenuous substance which Keely  claimed to have the consistency
             of taffy at one stage, a tenuous vapor at another.

             According to Keely, water could be dissociated to a wide range
             of products depending on what set of frequencies were applied.
             In one case, we find mention of what appears  to  be  a plasma
             since it  is termed a "luminiferous" gas.  The visible flashes
             as mentioned  in  the  preceding   article   confirm   Keely's
             statements regarding  the "Luminiferous Aether"  as  he  found
             when applying various sonic harmonies to fluids and gases.

             Our friends,  Dale  Pond  and  Victor Hansen have been looking
             into the operational principles  of  one of the last remaining
             Keely Motors.   They  have  come  to the conclusion  that  the
             machine takes advantage of CAVITATION.

             CAVITATION refers  to  small  "bubbles"  which are produced in
             liquid mediums  subjected to  pressure  displacements.   These
             bubbles are  easily  noticed  in  ultrasonic   cleaning  tanks
             containing water  or  other  fluids.   When the high intensity
             ultrasonic waves pound the water  in  a reciprocal motion, the
             bubbles form on the return stroke of the wave.

             Commercial ultrasonic units include the warning  that  one  is
             not to  leave  material  in  the machine while under power for
             extended lengths of time.  The  bubbles (cavities) formed will
             pound the  material  to  a  point  which  will  eat  into  its
             structure.

             I have  seen  a stainless steel film processor rack left in an
             industrial unit for 2 hours.   The  structure of this rack was
             flawless before the process and had thousands  of  pits  as if
             eaten away by small vermin when removed 2 hours later.

             The Keely  engine  runs  on water and has two pistons.  When a
             piston thrusts  forward,  it   pushes  the  water  through  an
             orifice.  The secret of operation is believed  to  be  in  the
             return stroke  of the piston which creates these micro bubbles
             (cavitation) to create tremendous  suction in their attempt to
             collapse.

             Since the  water is under great pressure in  the  engine,  the
             suction forces  are  consequently  magnified  far beyond water
             that found in a non-pressurized vessel.

             When the cavitation bubbles strive to collapse in their effort
             to re-establish pressure equilibrium, the suction pressure is

                                      Page 2





             somehow shunted  off to an accumulator.  This accumulator then
             provides power for the operation  of  the  device  with  extra
             power for what is termed an "over-unity" motor.

             Keely also mentions the specific frequencies  of  620, 630 and
             12,000 CPS  as releasing finer forces (greater pressures) held
             in bondage  in  the water molecule.   The  620  disrupted  the
             molecule, the 630 disrupted the atoms comprising  the molecule
             and the  12,000  disrupted the inter-atomic structure of those
             atoms.  Modern discoveries  have  termed  the components which
             comprise the atom as "quarks."

             In the   researches   of  John  Keely,  he  found   all   mass
             aggregations to  be  built  up  from  7  states of matter.  In
             progressive order, these are :

                    1)  Compound inter-aetheric
                        2)  Inter-Aetheric
                            3)  Aetheric
                                4)  Inter-atomic
                                    5)  Atomic
                                        6)  Inter-molecular
                                            7)  Molecular

             Here at KeelyNet we spell Ether as "AETHER" to avoid confusion
             with the chemical Ether.  Aether  is  the finest of the levels
             of being  in the universe.  It is an elastic  substance  which
             permeates and  indeed  comprises  all energy and matter in the
             Universe through its various manifestations.

             By the term manifestation, we  mean  that Aether can be slowed
             down through  the use of interferences to ever  lower  states.
             These in turn manifest as energy and matter.  The structure of
             this "cascading force-flow" is:

                    1)  Aether
                        2)  Magnetism
                            3)  Electricity
                                4)  Cosmic rays
                                    5)  Light
                                        6)  Heat
                                            7)  Physical vibration
                                                8)  Matter

             By properly  "resisting"  (interfering) with the Aether OR any
             of its lower manifestations  one  can  create  the  next lower
             manifestation.

             Of course,  this process can be reversed through  the  use  of
             "harmonic interfences" to multiply vibration to the point that
             it becomes  the  next  higher  level.   In this manner, we can
             intentionally access any of  the  various  levels of energy or
             matter.

             Puharich says  he found 600 CPS to be the best  frequency  for
             the dissociation  of  water into hydrogen and oxygen as driven
             by weak sources of electrical  energy,  in  this  case,  solar
             cells.  The idea was to install a hydrogen accumulator in your
             garage and refill your car gas (literally) tank from your own

             home supply.   The  problem with this was that hydrogen stored
             in such  a  manner  would  create   massive  safety  problems.
             Vehicles using such storage systems have been  termed "Highway
             Hindenbergs" due to the extreme volatility of hydrogen.

             We are  pursuing  more  information on the technology used for
             the continuous generation  of  the  visible  bursts  and  will
             follow up this paper with our findings.
