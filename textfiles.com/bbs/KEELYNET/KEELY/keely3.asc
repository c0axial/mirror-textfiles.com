                            The Story of the Keely Myth

       Mr. Julius Moritzen   makes   an   interesting  tale  in  the  April
       COSMOPOLITAN out of "The Extraordinary Story of John Worrell Keely."

       Mr. Moritzen says that Keely was  in  truth  a  genius, as none else
       than a genius  could  have kept the world's most eminent  scientists
       guessing for twenty  years.   His  "vibratory  generator"  was first
       exhibited to a dozen well-known Philadelphians on November 10, 1874.

       Even in the minds of the most skeptical  there was always at least a
       doubt in the mystery about Keely's projects until  the  day  of  his
       death, when his  house was investigated and the commonplace trickery
       of his methods exposed.

       "Leading Philadelphian scientists  assisted  in  the  work,  and the
       first discovery came in the shape of an immense steel globe.  Almost
       covered with dirt and rubbish, it was held down in  the earth of the
       cellar by heavy beams.

       When relieved of  its  incumbrance  the sphere was lifted out of its
       resting-place, and subsequently was  found  to weigh more than three
       tons.  On the  top  of the globe a hole was discovered  and,  screw-
       threaded, the cavity gave a wider diameter the further penetrated.

       "Immediately near the  sphere was found an iron pipe which led for a
       distance of more than fifteen feet  into  the  space under the front
       room.  Here was discovered a pit lined with wood  and  covered  by a
       trap-door.

       Fresh ashes gave  evidence  of  a careful demolition of material not
       thought valuable enough for removal,  and  yet necessary to have out
       of the way.  In these ashes, however, were found short  sections  of
       what at first  was considered to be wire, but subsequently proved to
       be brass tubing.

       A large amount of glass tubes was likewise found in the debris.  The
       fragments left behind gave striking  evidence  of the care exercised
       in removing the Keely motor machinery from its home.

       "The next day  still  greater  results rewarded the searchers of the
       premises.  The room  in the rear  was  curiously  raised  above  the
       others, and this  was  the  apartment in which Keely  conducted  all
       those experiments which had puzzled the world until his death.

       "When the floor  was  torn  up the revelation was complete.  Through
       the joists, in holes specially cut  for  the  purpose,  ran  a short
       brass tube.  Other tubes were discovered also, and the whole went to
       show that the  motor  had  been  connected here with  the  spherical
       contrivance in the cellar.

       "In the presence  of Prof. Arthur W. Goodspeed, professor of physics
       at the University of Pennsylvania,  Prof.  Carl  Hering,  one of the
       most eminent electrical  engineers  in the country,  Prof.  Lightner
       Witmer, professor of  experimental  psychology  of the University of
       Pennsylvania, and Mr. Moore, who  had  the  investigation in charge,
       the nature of  what  had  been  laid bare now came  in  for  earnest
       consideration.

       It was determined  beyond  a doubt that the tubing and the spherical
       reservoir found in the cellar stood  conclusively  for  the argument
       that compressed air might easily have accomplished all that had been
       demonstrated so mysteriously by Keely."

       Mr. Moritzen goes into the details of Keely's trickeries  and  shows
       just how he probably got his "etheric force," which tore apart great
       ropes, broke and  twisted  iron bars, and discharged bullets through
       twelve-inch planks with what seemed  to  be  an  entirely mysterious
       force.

       In his exuberance of success Keely declared that  he  would  be able
       with a quart  of  water  to  send  a  train from Philadelphia to San
       Francisco, and that to propel a steamship from New York to Liverpool
       and return would require just about one gallon of the same.

       Keely never allowed the slightest  hint to fall as to the details of
       his secret force, claiming that this would hurt the commercial value
       of his discovery.  Mr. Moritzen says that Keely's true secret was in
       the promoter's charm of manner and insight into human nature.
