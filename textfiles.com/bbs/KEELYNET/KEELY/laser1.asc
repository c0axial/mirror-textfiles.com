                                   Laser Taster

       A method of  tasting wine using lasers compares in accuracy with the
       human palate.  It can not only evaluate  the taste of wines but also
       predict the ones that will age best.

       The technique was  developed by Dr. Philip Wyatt,  a  physicist  and
       president of Science  Spectrum, Inc., a California firm specializing
       in biomedical instruments.

       "In a wine," Wyatt says, "taste is CREATED by PROTEIN MOLECULES that
       agglomerate into particles.   For   some   reason,  THE  LARGER  THE
       PARTICLES, the WORSE A WINE TASTES."

       A device is  used  which  was originally designed to  determine  the
       sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics.  It can measure the size and
       quantity of the particles suspended in the wine.

       The instrument is  known  as  a  Differential Light-Scattering (DLS)
       Photometer.  It projects a laser beam  through  a tube of wine which
       has been diluted 10 to 1.

       The amount and direction of the light scattered by  the particles is
       measured and plotted  on  a  graph.   Each wine has a CHARACTERISTIC
       ASSORTMENT of floating particles which produces a UNIQUE DLS PATTERN
       and therefore has its own curve.

       Wines with large  particles scatters  a  great  deal  of  light  and
       creates a STEEP  CURVE.   These  wines  generally have  an  inferior
       taste.

       The better-tasting wines  are  more  often associated with SMOOTHER,
       FLATTER CURVES resulting  from  smaller   particles  that  are  MORE
       HOMOGENEOUS IN SIZE.

       Today's drinkable wines may taste watery after aging.   Due  to this
       watery taste, Wyatt  suggests looking for a steep curve when seeking
       a wine to put away for the future.

       "To predict which wine you may enjoy in ten or twelve years, we look
       for a wine  with VERY LARGE PARTICLES,  this  indicates  a  WINE  IN
       EVOLUTION."

       When the laser  was  pitted against a group of amateur wine tasters,
       BOTH ranked the selections IN ALMOST IDENTICAL ORDER.

       Since all drinkers have their own preference, Wyatt suggests placing
       the light-scattering curve for particular  wines on the label. "This
       way a person can go up to a bottle and say, 'Oh, that's  my shape, I
       know I'm going to like this.'"

       Vangard notes...

          Marcel Vogel has developed a process which uses crystals to "age"
          wine to various levels over a very short period.

          As per  the  info in this paper, we can see that the "homogeneous
          structure" is  all critical to  the  taste  of  the  wine.   Most
          interestingly, this ties in to Homeopathy and the  potentizing of
          a substance to form a "reagent".

          As the   particle   becomes   more   diffuse  through  successive
          blendings, the frequency goes up.   This  indicates that superior
          taste is based on finer (read higher) frequencies.

          Most interesting  that smaller particles have higher  wavelengths
          which give  "finer"  taste.   This  fits  perfectly  with Keely's
          contentions that all mass and  energy  flows  are  the  result of
          frequency interferences.  Long before modern physics or Einstein.

          This process of scattering could be further modified  to generate
          complex "signatures" for radionic or matter control purposes.
