                                  Magic Mechanics

       Jakarta, Indonesia - The World Bank knows that Indonesia's  economic
       problems can't be  solved  by  magic.   But fixing the boss's car is
       another matter.

       Just ask Nicholas Hope, resident director of the World Bank's office
       here.  After an accident damaged  his  Toyota  Crown, a local garage
       said repairs -  mainly  body work - would take two  weeks  and  cost
       $700.  Too long  and  too  much,  Mr.  Hope's staff decided, turning
       instead to a  practitioner of 'ketok  magic',  or  magic  knock,  an
       Indonesian hybrid in which mechanics tap unearthly  powers to better
       wield their socket wrenches and spot-welders.

       Half a day  later  the car came back, fully restored.  The bill came
       to just $122, and now, more than  18  months  later,  the car "still
       looks fine," Mr. Hope says.

       Thousands of ketok-magic  shops have opened in Indonesia  in  recent
       years.  Workers in  these  garages  protray themselves as merely the
       tools of a  magic spirit with which  they  can  commune  after  long
       periods of fasting and rigorous study.

       These magicians prefer  to  practise  their trade with  no  outsider
       looking on.  At  Ketok  Magic Nusantara, which fixed Mr. Hope's car,
       visitors are kept from the inner sanctum  by an iron fence.  Another
       garage bars customers from viewing the tools.

       All of Indonesia's under-the-hood sages claim ties to a day labourer
       from East Java named Turut, who acquired a reputation  as  a kind of
       Merlin among mechanics  before he died in 1986.  Eddy Susanto, a 32-
       year-old worker at Ketok Magic Nusantara,  says that, as a child, he
       saw Mr. Turut pick up a length of railway track with his bare hands


                                      Page 1





       and tie it  around his waist.  Says Mr. Susanto: "It convinced me he
       wasn't an ordinary person."

       Mr. Turut guided Mr. Susanto and 29  other self-proclaimed disciples
       through a training regimen.  They earned the right  both to practise
       ketok magic and  to  train  others,  but  proselytizing  has  proven
       difficult.  Young people "aren't patient to learn the magic things,"
       Mr. Susanto says.

       Sceptics abound. Ishak  Ismail,   owner   of   a  Buyong  Motors,  a
       conventional Jakarta garage, says: "I don't believe in such a thing.
       I do the real things.  No magic."

       Tarsikun, the driver who delivered Mr. Hope's World  Bank car to its
       ketok doctor, is  also dubious.  He says that while waiting outside,
       he heard loud noises that "didn't  sound  like  magic."   Still,  he
       adds, "the results are OK, and much faster than ordinary workshops."
