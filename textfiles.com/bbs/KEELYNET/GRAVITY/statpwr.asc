       The Space Station  represents the commitment of the United States to
       a lasting future  in  space.  This   future   will   be   ripe  with
       intellectual and technical challenges. It will hold vast opportunity
       for commercial profit  and  preservation  of  the nation's  economic
       vitality. It will  be  both  a  research  facility  in  space  and a
       stepping-stone to long-term human space exploration and discovery.

       The Space Station   demonstrates    that    America's    significant
       achievements in space lie ahead of us, not behind  us.  The  Station
       also symbolizes our  nation's  desire  to  cooperate  with others in
       mutually beneficial civil space activities.

       Canada, the European Space Agency,  and Japan have already responded
       positively to the U.S. invitation to participate in  the development
       of the Station.  Formal agreements are being negotiated and are near
       completion.

       If the negotiations  are  successful, their involvement will lead to
       unprecedented international cooperation,    toward    the   peaceful
       exploration and utilization of the space environment.

       During the early  planning  stages  of  the  Space Station  Program,
       before the first  engineer  was  allowed to set pencil to paper, two
       major questions had to be answered:

                      o  Who will use the Space Station?

                      o  What resources will have to be
                         provided to those users?

       A detailed survey of the technical  community showed that five types
       of experiments would most likely be performed on the Space Station.

                      o  Observational sciences (astronomy and Earth
                         observations)

                      o  Life sciences

                      o  Materials sciences

                      o  Servicing/repair, and

                      o  Technology development/testing


                                      Page 1





       The major resources these potential users demanded were found to be:

                      o  Power

                      o  Volume

                      o  Crew time

       The quantitative evaluation of these user requirements defined the
       ground rules for the engineering studies that led to the system
       definition and preliminary design of the Space Station baseline
       configuration.

                          THE SPACE STATION POWER LEVEL

       Electrical power, in many respects, is the most critical resource
       aboard the Space  Station.  Electricity  is  essential to supporting
       human life in space. It allows a multitude of systems on board Space
       Station to operate, support, and produce.

       Whether electricity is used to power  life support systems, to run a
       furnace making crystals, to manage a computerized data  distribution
       system, or to operate a centrifuge, electricity is the key.

       The more electricity available, the more work possible, and the more
       flexible the entire array of Space Station activities becomes. A
       comfortable amount of  power  allows  men and women to utilize their
       own most precious resources: observation and innovation.

                                      Page 2





       Adequate power allows   a   crew,   in   orbit,  and  a  variety  of
       researchers, using telescience capabilities  from  the  ground,  the
       opportunity to make instantaneous observations and responses.

       In a severely   power-constrained   environment,   flexibility   and
       spontaneity are diminished.   This,  in  turn, limits the invaluable
       utility of a permanent human presence in space.

       In addition, power  runs  the infrastructure  of  the  hardware  and
       software that supports the entire facility. For this reason, Space
       Station power systems  and  power-level  projections  have  been  an
       important focus of  attention  during Phase A and Phase B definition
       and design stages.

       The power level  given  as  the  ground   rule   in  the  "reference
       configuration," the starting point for analytical studies during the
       Space Station Concept Definition and Preliminary Design Phase (Phase
       B), was 75 kW with growth capability to 300 kW.

       The Space Station assembly sequence supplied 25 kW  of  photovoltaic
       power by the  second  flight.  This  25  kW  of  power would support
       general station-keeping requirements  and  early payloads that would
       be provided during the assembly phase of the program.

       An additional 50 kW of solar dynamic power was planned downstream in
       the assembly sequence, raising the total power supply  to 75 kW, the
       baseline level for the permanently manned phase.

       This figure was  based  on  the  projected needs of the future Space
       Station user community  and  early  estimates  of  the  housekeeping
       power.

       A review by Congress of Space Station concluded that the preliminary
       power of 25  kW  was  insufficient  to  adequately   support   early
       payloads.

       As a result,  the  initial  power  level was increased to 37.5 kW of
       photovoltaic power. With the addition  of the 50 kW of solar dynamic
       power intended for  the later stage of the Station development,  the
       total power level for the program climbed to 87.5 kW.

       It should be  noted  that  the absence of a permanent crew in such a
       configuration makes crew  time  the   most  critical  parameter  and
       severely limits the kind of experiments that can be performed.

       The Space Station  review ordered by the NASA Administrator  at  the
       end of Phase B resulted in several changes to the Phase B results,
       including a reordering of the assembly sequence to allow for early
       user operation and confirming power at 87.5 kW.

       A subsequent cost  review  resulted  in  the  "phased"  approach  to
       construction of the  Space  Station.  Early  calculations  of  power
       needed in this approach yielded 50 kW.

       Further examination of user and housekeeping requirements,  however,
       resulted in an  increase  of that figure to 75 kW for Phase I and an
       additional 50 kW (125 kW total) for a future Phase II.

                         THE SPACE STATION POWER SYSTEM

       The only continuously  available  source  of  energy  in  this solar
       system is the Sun. The Sun's energy  is  available  in  the  form of
       light and heat; however, spacecraft need electricity.

       Accordingly, NASA has  pioneered  and  is  continuing   to   develop
       technologies to efficiently  convert  the  Sun's  energy  (light and
       heat) into electrical power.

       Some materials, such as silicon and gallium arsenide, can directly
       convert light to electricity. Hence, "solar cells" can be made from
       these materials.

       The efficiency of energy conversion by this method is not very high;
       it ranges from 5 to 10 percent. The cells, however, can be assembled
       into "arrays" and these can be used to generate high power levels.

       In fact, the 75 kW required for the  Space  Station  Manned Base and
       the power for the Polar Platform will be generated entirely by solar
       arrays.

       A spacecraft in orbit around the Earth is not always in direct
       sunlight. Thus, energy  has  to  be stored to provide  a  continuous
       source of electricity.

       Storage is usually  accomplished  by  using  batteries, which is the
       method of choice for Space Station.  The Space Station "photovoltaic
       power module" contains both the solar arrays and the batteries.

       ____________________________________________________________________


       The photovoltaic power   system  is  well  understood  and  has  the
       advantage of being off-the-self technology.  Its disadvantage is the
       large size of the arrays required to generate sufficient power.

       In addition, the large weight and relatively short  lifetime  (about
       five years) of the batteries is a disadvantage.

       The Space Station  will  operate  in  low  Earth  orbit  (about  220
       nautical miles). In this, or any other  near-earth orbit, there is a
       certain amount of "drag," i.e. resistance to the progression of the
       spacecraft.

       As a consequence, the spacecraft tends to slow down.   This  results
       in a loss of altitude, a gradual progression towards an ultimate de-
       orbit.

       To prevent the  Station  from  eventually reentering the atmosphere,
       periodic reboost of the spacecraft  is  necessary.   This requires a
       resupply of propellant: the larger the area, the  larger  the  drag,
       and the more reboost propellant is needed.

       Resupply of the  propellant is needed. Resupply of the propellant is
       part of the life-cycle cost.

       Decreasing the area of the spacecraft  minimizes  drag.  The largest
       area of the Space Station is the solar arrays. Early design concepts
       indicated that a  reduction in the area of solar arrays  represented
       life-cycle cost reduction.

       However, a newer  design  concept  has mitigated the increased life-
       cycle costs associated with reboosting,  by  using  a  hydrogen fuel
       obtained from surplus supplies of water. Therefore,  the size of the
       solar array no longer drives life-cycle costs as directly.





       Another source of  life-cycle  cost  is  the  need  to  replace  the
       batteries after five years.  The use  of  a long-life energy storage
       system represents life-cycle cost savings.

       A solar dynamic  power  system  might provide a solution  for  these
       problems. This technology,   far  different  from  the  photovoltaic
       system, utilizes the  Sun's  heat  instead  of  its  light  for  the
       production of power.

       Heat is collected  in  the focal point of a mirror.  Power  is  then
       generated exactly the same way as on an earthbound power station: by
       heating a fluid, which in turn rotates a turbine.

       Since a heat/gas-driven  turbine  is  a  much  more  efficient power
       converter than a sunlight-driven solar cell, the mirror (the largest
       part of the solar dynamic system)  would  have to be only one-fourth
       the area of a solar array to generate the same amount  of power from
       the Sun's light.

       There are several  different  engines  that  can  be  used  for  the
       generation of power  within  the  solar  dynamic  system.  They  are
       similar in that  they  are  "closed cycle," i.e., they  recycle  the
       working fluid.  These  engines  are  usually  known  by the names of
       their inventor. For use on Space Station,  the  Brayton Cycle engine
       has been selected.

       The energy storage device used for a solar dynamic power system is
       superior to a photovoltaic system because heat is stored rather than
       electricity. Heat is  cheaper  and  far  more simple  to  store  for
       subsequent use.

       Storage can be  accomplished  by taking advantage of the heating, or
       fusion, of inorganic salts. On the  sunny side of the Earth, heat is
       absorbed by the salt and it melts. On the dark (cold)  side the salt
       freezes and gives  up  its  heat to the working fluid of the engine,
       ensuring continuous operation.

                                   S U M M A R Y

       An abundant supply of power is one  of  the top priorities for users
       of the Space  Station  and  therefore, of highest priority  for  the
       Space Station Program.

       It was for  this  reason that the original "hybrid" power system was
       chosen: it provided early power to  the  user  by using off-the-self
       photovoltaic/battery technology, then  adding the  more  "growable,"
       but higher risk,  solar  dynamic  system  later.  This  concept  was
       revised in light of budget realities.  By  using  only  photovoltaic
       modules in Phase  I,  NASA will be able to meet budget  restrictions
       without sacrificing the needs of the users.

       The ability to  utilize  solar dynamic systems with lower life-cycle
       cost will be added in the future as the Space Station evolves.
