                        Coral Castle - 20th Century Wonder

       From time immemorial,  men  have  created  fabulous stone works that
       have excited the  curiosity  of  later   generations.   People  have
       marveled at the Pyramids of Egypt, Stonehenge of England,  the Great
       Wall of China,  and  other  famous  stone  works scattered about the
       earth.

       One of the most awe-inspiring stone creations is the Coral Castle of
       Florida, created single-handedly by  the late Edward Leedskalnin, an
       obscure Latvian immigrant.  Located 25 miles south  of Miami on U.S.
       Highway 1, it is breathtaking in scope and imagination, unbelievable
       for skill and patience required. Constructed in complete secrecy, it
       baffles engineers and laymen alike.

       The story of this fantastic castle began more than 50 years ago when
       Edward Leedskalnin came  to  South  Florida.  He chose this sparsely
       settled section of Florida because  he  "wanted to get away from the
       world."  Here he  began  many years of self-induced  hard  labor  in
       order to forget his unrequited love for his one and only sweetheart.
       This young  girl  who  he always referred to as his "Sweet Sixteen,"
       jilted him for another on the eve of their wedding day in his native
       Latvia.  An extremely  sensitive soul,  he  was deeply hurt and made
       the decision to leave his native country and seek solace elsewhere.

       Here on the edge of the Everglades he apparently  felt  he  was  far
       enough away from  people,  and  settled down on a small plot of land
       which a generous neighbor permitted him to use.

       He built a house from logs cut from  the  surrounding pine trees and
       coral rock which  he  quarried  on  the premises.   Thus  began  the
       strange and unusual  project he set for himself, interrupted only by
       his moving to  a  larger  plot  of   ground  three  miles  north  of
       Homestead, which after  25 years of continuous labor  culminated  in
       the completion of what can only be described as one of the strangest
       works of man in all history.

       The Coral Castle  is  no ordinary structure.  It is set on a 10-acre
       tract of land, the castle proper being  surrounded by an eight-foot-
       high wall made  of huge blocks of coral rock, each weighing  several
       tons.

       The tower contains 243 tons, the first floor of which Leedskalnin

                                      Page 1





       used as a  workshop and the second floor housed his living quarters.
       An air of mystery prevailed about  these  quarters  since no one was
       permitted entry.

       Behind the huge  walls  of  the  castle  in beautiful  settings  are
       fantastic pieces of  coral  rock furniture and movable objects which
       he created from his fertile imagination.   There  are rocking chairs
       weighing thousands of pounds so delicately balanced they move at the
       touch of a finger.

       Couches, beds, chairs, tables of all sizes and shapes, including one
       table hewn from  solid coral rock into the shape  of  the  state  of
       Florida, and another  cut into the shape of a heart with a beautiful
       ever-blooming floral centerpiece growing  out  of the center of this
       rock table.

       There are huge  crescents  atop  walls  20  feet  high,  an  obelisk
       reaching up to  the  sky  weighing  28  tons that Leedskalnin set in
       place by the  use  of simple hand  tools.   There  is  an  ingenious
       Polaris telescope carved out of the coral rock standing  25  foot in
       height.  As in  most  castles  there  is a subterranean well, with a
       circular staircase carved out of  the  rock  leading  down  into the
       water.  Leedskalnin's famous nine-ton gate is in the east wall.

       The Coral Castle  has  become  a familiar sight over  the  years  to
       travelers on US  Higway  1  on  the  way to the Florida Keys.  Many,
        ntrigued by this coral edifice have  taken  the time to explore it,
       while others raced by wondering at its incongruity  in  this  modern
       world of ours.

       Those who stopped   were   met  by  the  man  who  constructed  this
       monumental work, and  guided around  while  he  explained  its  many
       mysteries.  But one thing he never told anyone was  how  he ever was
       able to move  the  huge  coral rocks weighing up to 35 tons which he
       excavated single-handed.  When asked, he replied simply that he knew
       the secrets used in the building of the Pyramids of Egypt.

       Whatever the secrets or principles  of  construction  he  used, they
       died with him when he passed away in a Miami hospital  in  December,
       1951.  It can  be said his knowledge of the practical use of pulleys
       and levers was not exceeded by the ancient Greeks or Egyptians.

       Altogether there are approximately  1000  tons of coral rock used in
       the construction of  the  walls  and  tower  alone,   a   stupendous
       achievement for one man, unequaled in all history.  In addition more
       than 100 tons  of  coral  rock  were  used  in  the  carvings of the
       artistic objects throughout the entire castle.

       Recognition of Edward Leedskalnin's  masterpiece  has grown steadily
       over the years.  Acknowledged today as possibly the  best example of
       native or primitive  art  in the United States, it is also acclaimed
       as one of  the  finest examples of  massive  stone  construction  in
       America.  It is considered by many as one of the true wonders of the
       world.

       For more than 50 years it has been a landmark of South  Florida, and
       Leedskalnin has become  a legendary figure.  Thus, although he never
       again saw the girl who inspired  him,  the  Coral  Castle  of  South
       Florida stands as  a  monument  for  all to see and  marvel  at  the
       genius, imagination and skill of this strange but brilliant man.

                                  Coral Castle :
                     A Monumental Feat Accomplished by One Man
                                  by Fred Graham

       A frail man  weighing  not  more than 100 pounds quarried a piece of
       coral from the earth weighing over 28 tons.  He then transported it,
       raised it, all alone, without the aid of machinery or modern tools.

       Edward Leedskalnin of South Florida did just that and much more.  He
       cut, quarried and raised a castle  consisting  of over 1,000 tons of
       coral rock and 100 tons of carvings, the greatest achievement in our
       history.  His coral building blocks included stones  weighing  twice
       the weight of  the largest block of the Great Pyramid.  His creation
       of Rock Gate, later to be called Coral  Castle, ranks with the great
       wonders of our world....with the mysteries in stone on Easter Island
       and with Stonehenge in England.  It is located on  U.S.  1  25 miles
       south of Miami.

       To this day,  no  one, not scientist or engineer, can explain how he
       was able to accomplish this Herculean project.

       B. J. Cathie, a captain flying with  National  Airways  Corp. of New
       Zealand and author of "Harmonic 33" and "Harmonic 695,  the  UFO and
       Anti-Gravity," presents a  look into the Coral Castle happening that
       Ed just might agree with if he were alive today.

       Cathie's well researched theory  is  that  a  vast  power  grid that
       governs a whole   array   of  extra-ordinary  and  unrelated   world
       phenomena has been  set  up  "between some groups on this planet and
       the UFOs."

       Captain Cathie believes that "one  day the scientists will no longer
       be able to turn their backs on the basic precepts of  true  science.
       They will have to examine all evidence impartially before they reach
       their conclusions; and  instead of offering only ridicule, they will
       carry out a full world-wide investigation  into  all  the  phenomena
       related to UFO's and the grid from which those vehicles  are drawing
       their power."

       In his writing  he  says,  "We  wonder;  couldn't  it  be  that  the
       scientists have the full explanation  of  UFO's, and for reasons not
       yet clear, are  deliberately keeping the knowledge  as  a  jealously
       guarded secret within their own closed ranks?"

       The captain explains  that  there  exists,  on  our  globe,  an all-
       encompassing grid, the interlocking lines of which correspond to the
       lines of flight of verified UFO appearances.

       Once the discovery of a geometric  pattern of UFO activity was made,
       it seemed to  indicate a definite purpose in the presence  of  UFO's
       about our planetary  surface.   When  the  grid was broken down into
       mathematical coordinates, it was found  that  all values represented
       in the grid  had  direct harmonic relationships with  the  speed  of
       light, gravity and earth mass.

       When the author  correlated  all  of  the  different  phenomena,  he
       concluded, "All major changes of the physical state, anywhere in the
       world, are brought  about  by the  harmonic  interactions  of  those
       manifestations which we refer to as; gravity, light, mass,

                                      Page 3





       electrical and magnetic forces.

       The controlled manipulation  of  these  resonant forces would, in my
       hypothesis, make it possible to move  mass from one point to another
       in space time  (that  is,  to  the  eye  of a theoretical  observer,
       instantaneously)."

       In summation, Cathie says, "Other measurements from the Coral Castle
       position to the  zero-degree and 90-degree longitude lines when they
       passed through the equator also yielded  harmonics  related to light
       and gravity.  The final check of the distance between  Coral  Castle
       and grid pole  A  in  the  north  dispelled any doubt about the site
       being in an ideal position to allow  Leedskalnin  to  erect the huge
       blocks of coral  with relative ease.  Measurements  from  all  major
       points gave the  geometric  harmonics necessary for the manipulation
       of anti-gravity."

       It seems that  Ed  Leedskalnin  knew  what  he  was  doing  when  he
       deliberately sele ted this area for the erection of  his famed Coral
       Castle.

       Whether or not  he  knew  the  secrets  of  the  Pyramids,  or  more
       modernly, levitation, anti-gravity  or  the  secret  of the UFO grid
       will never be known.  His secret died with him in 1951.

       Was he a  man  born  before his time, or was he a man  from  perhaps
       another time?  Whatever  the  case,  Ed  Leedskalnin was a man whose
       mission on earth was known to him.  He has left his monuments for us
       to ponder, his secrets for us to discover and his Coral Castle as an
       accomplishment worthy of our admiration and respect.

       Vangard notes...

          The above information is sent out as part of a press kit obtained
          by writing  Coral  Castle  of Florida,  28655  S.  Federal  Hwy.,
          Homestead, Florida 33033.

          Our attention was first brought to this interesting  matter  from
          the television  show  "In Search of...".  The story was broadcast
          sometime in 1980 as I recall.  From that a phone call was made to
          the proprietors of the structure which yielded the press kit.

          The TV show said that Leedskalnin  was  believed  to have sang to
          the stones.  It was said that he placed his hands on the stone to
          be lifted and sang which somehow caused it to  lose  weight.   NO
          ONE EVER SAW HIM DO THIS!  However, the structure remains to show
          he knew  something  far in advance of engineering technology then
          or now.

          Another comment from the TV show  was that no trace could be seen
          indicating the use of a hoist, pulley or lever/fulcrum.

          I was so intrigued that I finally flew out there  for vacation in
          1986.  The  site  is very impressive and I climbed all over it to
          examine all the stone artifacts.

          Contrary to the report about no indications of hoists or pulleys,
          I found several rings attached  to  the outside walls which could
          be used to provide a hoist.  Also of interest was the technique

                                      Page 4





          Leedskalnin developed  to quarry the coral.  He would shatter the
          coral to develop a crack, then  widen  the  crack  with a tool by
          continual digging.

          He would then heat up automobile shock absorbers  (leaf  springs)
          which would  cause  them  to  lose their spring.  These were then
          placed in the crack between the  stones.   When  cold  water  was
          poured on them, they would spring open to separate the coral.

          Leedskalnin also did many experiments, particularly into the area
          of magnets and electricity.  His point of view  is  so  different
          from most that KeelyNet will place all the information we have on
          him in consecutive files named LEED1 and up.

          The next  file LEED2 will contain his outlook on politics and how
          property is the main reason for  the  existence  of  governments,
          etc.  A  most  discerning viewpoint.  All subsequent  LEED  files
          will contain as much technical info as we have on the subject.

          As to  levitation,  the  TV  show  had  witnesses  who  had known
          Leedskalnin.  One lady in particular  spoke of the singing to the
          stones.   Another  account  says  he  would have  a  large  truck
          deliver a huge block.

          When asked if he had a hoist or A-frame to move it, Ed would tell
          the driver  to  return  on  the  morrow  to  retrieve  his truck.
          Overnite, Leedskalnin would single-handedly  manage  to  move the
          stone from the truck onto his site.

          One of  the  witnesses  said  that many people tried  to  "catch"
          Leedskalnin in  the  act  of  moving a stone so that once and for
          all, his method would be known.   She  said  that  he  seemed  to
          "know" when he was being watched and would simply  putter  around
          or go to other parts of the structure.

          At present,  the verdict is not in on Leedskalnin.  The fact that
          I SAW  evidence  of  physical  manipulation  techiques  does  NOT
          preclude the possibility that he had other methods  of moving the
          stones.

          Personally, based  on  the  researches  of  Keely  in addition to
          others, I think levitation CAN  be  induced  in matter, even with
          such a simple tool as the human voice.  The priests of Egypt were
          trained to develop deep and resonant voices to  carry  out  their
          priestly functions.  The use of voice and music is touted in such
          legends as Orpheus and how music can soothe the savage beast.

          It is  known  from  the  study of CHLADNI surfaces, resonance and
          interference, that all matter  is  affected  to  some  degree  by
          artifically applied waves of force, no matter what  the nature of
          the force, i.e. sound, electricity, magnetic fields, heat, etc...
          If the  waves  are  structured  and  intelligently  applied,  the
          effects can encompass a wide range of phenomena.

          Stories and legends abound relating to Egyptians, Mayans, Druids,
          Eastern and Western Indians, etc.  exhibiting  "powers" generated
          from voice, geometric patterns and/or combinations of substances.

          If Leedskalnin simply developed a superior means of

                                      Page 5





          multiplication of  effort  through  leverage,  then  he must have
          researched the  matter  in  local   libraries  or  come  to  some
          "realization" beyond that currently available.

          Based on his researches into magnetic current,  it  would  appear
          that Leedskalnin  was  onto something FAR BEYOND simple leverage.
