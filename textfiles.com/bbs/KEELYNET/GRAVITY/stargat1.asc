This file is the method of determining a destination from a symbol as
described in the EXCELLENT movie STARGATE.  If you haven't seen it, you are
missing one of the most stimulating movies in several years.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seven points can be used to outline a course to any position.

To find the DESTINATION within any three dimensional space, we need six
points to determine the EXACT location.

Numbers 1 through 6 are the centered faces of a cube.  Draw a line between
1 & 3, 2 & 4 and 5 & 6 which will create a six pointed star.

To chart a COURSE, you need a point of origin (the 7th point).  This 7th point
represents the point from which the cube is being viewed.

The cube is an idealized condition used to demonstrate the concept.  There
most likely won't be a pattern of stars which form a perfect cube using the
six points as viewed from an earth perspective.

Since each star system is centered by a sun, by looking out into space, we see
various patterns which are made up by the location of the other solar systems.

Each pattern is referred to as a chevron.

The pyramid shape, topped by a disc representing the sun, indicates what a
constellation of star systems would look like at high noon if viewed from the
tip of the pyramid.

The premise of the movie is that an alien entity uses some kind of resonant
ring to allow teleportation between star systems.  Each system has one of
these resonant rings with custom 'chevrons' which reflect the pattern as seen
from the planet on which the ring is found.

The movie shows 7 chevrons having to be made which to my mind seems to
indicate a hopping from one star system to another.  This is because the star
system to which the characters teleported was not visible from Earth, yet by
drawing a line (the 7th point) from an Earth pyramid at high noon, outwards
into space, it must eventually intersect a target planet in a target solar
system.

When the computer guided tracking arm was showing the motion of the remote
crawler robot, it appeared to jump from one star system to another, because it
required 6 different chevrons, finally reaching the destination planet.

What makes this movie so intriguing is the realization that our sun must be
linked with other suns throughout the universe.  The nature of the energy
could well be gravitation but the subject is open to debate.  However, there
is research being done which indicates many 'corridors' of energy believed
to extend outwards from our sun to connect with other suns all over our
section of the universe.

Some of us joke because many times, we have seen TV shows, movies or other
information which indirectly reflects various projects which are being done in
private, or discussed in limited groups, with the intention being to openly
post the results on successful completion.  It raises questions about phone
taps, etc., when more probably it is the same ideas coming to many people,
especially writers and media producers.

When the earth crosses one of these 'corridors', the character of the energy
produces effects which are best classed as subtle influences.  It is
interesting to note, that the crossing of these various 'corridors' is marked
historically by holidays such as Halloween (Samhain), Easter (a rejuvenating
influence known LONG before Christ), Christmas and other holidays with ancient
metaphysical links.

So what does this mean in a practical sense?  There have been experiments done
where water and other fluids have been used to capture the quality of the star
system or planetary energy as it impinges itself on the earth when the earth
traverses one of these corridors.  That water then becomes 'structured' with
those influences and when taken, can transmit them into ones' body or
experiment.

There are ongoing experiments which are picking up perturbations in the
gravity wave (aether flows into the earth) when the earth approaches, is
immersed in, and departs out of one of these corridors.

The Druids and other ancient religious orders seemed to understand how
standing stones (menhirs), in their capacity (no pun intended) as very large
dielectrics, could be used to intercept gravity perturbations.  A more
advanced understanding led to an ability to reduce the weight of these stones
to the point they could be lifted or 'flown' as aerial craft.

The resonant cavity of a pyramid or other geometric form can possibly be
excited to such a degree that a resonance can be established with a similar
cavity in another location (distance is irrelevant).  Such a coupling would
produce an artificial 'corridor' which can be used for practical
teleportation, among other things.

The INCUNAB1 and INCUNAB2 files show how this principle can be used to shift
between 'quantum realities', where there are an infinite number of other
Earth's, each with their own 'quantum signature'.  This signature can be
represented in two dimensions (X,Y) as a mandala and in three dimensions
(X,Y,Z) as mantra (an spatial - structured - energy projection).

Once you have a catalog of signatures which represent destinations or targets
to project TO, production of a soliton signature will resonate with its mate,
creating a corridor of energy, which might allow for practical transfer of
matter from one physical location (or dimension) to another.  We will know
more of this in future as experiments are carried out.
