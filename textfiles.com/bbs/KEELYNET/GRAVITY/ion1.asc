                              ION-THRUSTER OPERATION

           The first electron-bombardment thruster was conceived and tested
       by Dr.  Harold  R. Kaufman in 1959 at the NASA Lewis Research Center
       (ref.  1).  The thruster operates  by  flowing  a gaseous propellant
       into a discharge chamber.

           The propellant  may  be any gas, but mercury,  cesium,  and  the
       noble gases are  the  most  efficient  for  propulsion applications.
       Propellant atoms are ionized in the  discharge  chamber  by electron
       bombardment in a process similar to that in a mercury arc sunlamp.

           This ionization  occurs when an atom in the discharge  loses  an
       electron after bombardment   by   an   energetic  (40-eV)  discharge
       electron.  The electrons  and  the    ions  form  a  plasma  in  the
       ionization chamber.

           The electric field between the screen and the accelerator  draws
       ions from the  plasma.   These ions are then accelerated out through
       many small holes in the screen and  accelerator electrode to form an
       ion beam.

           A neutralizer injects an equal number of electrons  into the ion
       beam.  This beam  of  electrons  allows  the  spacecraft  to  remain
       electrically neutral and is a requirement  for  successful  thruster
       operation.  A  more  complete description of the mercury-bombardment
       ion thruster is given in the appendix.

           Laboratory testing  of  thrusters  must  be done in a moderately
       large vacuum facility in order to simulate the environment of space.
       Facilities are thus required for laboratory testing.

           Typically, these facilities are  capable of simulating altitudes
       of more than 300 kilometers, where the background  air  pressure  is
       less than 1/100 000 000 of sea-level pressure.

           The development   of   the   mercury-bombardment   thruster  has
       continued through the 1960's to the  present time.  Thrusters 2.5 to
       150 centimeters in  diameter have been successfully  tested.   These
       thrusters require power  of  50  watts  to 200 kilowatts and produce
       thrust of 0.4x10(-3) to 4 newtons (0.1x10(-3) to 1 lb).

           Two of the most advanced bombardment  thrusters,  the  8-and 30-
       centimeter-diameter thrusters, are   described   in   the   sections
       AUXILIARY PROPULSION and     PRIMARY    PROPULSION,    respectively.
       Thrusters of these two sizes fulfill the requirements of present-day
       missions.





           Many laboratories in this country, Europe, and Japan have worked
       on a wide  variety  of  electric  thrusters.   These include colloid
       thrusters using a  doped-glycerine   propellant,   a   pulsed-plasma
       thruster using ablation of a Teflon propellant block (ref. 2), and a
       bombardment thruster using cesium propellant.

           In Germany,  France,  and  England,  numerous  laboratories  and
       universities are at  work  on  electric thrusters for both auxiliary
       and primary propulsion.   The  electric  propulsion  effort  by  the
       Soviet Union includes flights of Zond, Meteor, and Yantar spacecraft
       with ion thruster experiments onboard.

           The mercury-bombardment  thruster  technology developed  at  the
       NASA Lewis Research  Center  has  been  used worldwide.  England has
       developed the T-4 thruster based on this technology (ref. 3).

           The T-4 thruster is a 10-millinewton  (2.2mlb) thruster proposed
       as one of  two  possible ion thrusters to be flight  tested  by  the
       European Space Agency in late 1980.  The other thruster, the RIT-10,
       is a radiofrequency  mercury-bombardment  ion  thruster developed by
       Germany.  It has a similar thrust level of 10 millinewtons (2.2 mlb)
       (ref. 4).

           The Lewis technology has also  been used by Japan.  That country
       has built  and tested a 5-centimeter-diameter, 5-millinewton-thrust,
       mercury-bombardment thruster for  possible  flight  qualification in
       1982 (ref. 5).  Both the European  and  Japanese  ion  thrusters are
       proposed for auxiliary electric propulsion applications.

           Two spacecraft have been flown by the United States specifically
       for the purpose  of  testing ion thrusters in space.   These  tests,
       SERT I and SERT II, are described in the next two sections.
