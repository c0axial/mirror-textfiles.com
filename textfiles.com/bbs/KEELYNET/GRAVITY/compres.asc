                            Gravity Compression Theory
                                        by
                                 James E. Hartman

       Gravity is an act of matter in compression. Depending on the type or
       amount of matter under compression the more gravity will be released
       or transmitted to  surrounding matter.  An object weight over a body
       of water will weigh different than a body weighed on land. Also, the
       closer to the compression center the greater the influence.

       Also, gravity push becomes a reality  in  that  mass  is compressing
       downward hence more weight exerted pushing apart atoms  while  still
       compressing, heating up  the core. The higher electron mass and more
       neutrons it contains  the  greater  the  overall  gravitic  effects.
       These can only travel through matter as electrogravitic induction.

       Thats why as  one  goes higher in the atmosphere the  less  gravitic
       effects on a body.  In space only harmonic resonance effects bodies,
       that is the act of gravity as a signal rather than a force. It seeks
       mass through harmonized  contact.   Hence,  mass  seeking  mass  via
       gravitic harmonics. If this is true. Each planet sings or harmonizes
       at a set pitch around the sun, thereby  holding  orbit.  Earth sends
       one signal and the sun another.  The two compressed  effects permits
       orbits to occur.  The  total  sum of the harmonics is the positional
       harmonic. If these change, orbits change.

       If a Flying Saucer used solar harmonics, or universal harmonics to
       travel to other worlds it would  be  through  use  of  a  fine tuned
       gravitic harmonic.  Time would be fixed at that harmonic.  So rather
       than using black  holes,  one  would now use 'harmonic gravitic time
       ports' to travel through space, making 'Quantum Leap' a realization.
