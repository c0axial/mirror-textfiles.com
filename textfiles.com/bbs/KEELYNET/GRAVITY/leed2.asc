       Edward Leedskalnin, the  builder  of  Coral  Castle in South Florida
       wrote several papers which have managed to survive.  A small book by
       Leedskalnin entitled "A Book in Every  Home"  has  a distillation of
       his observations in life.  From this book, we take  the  document on
       Ed's idea of politics.  It is most discerning.

                                     Politics
                                 by Ed Leedskalnin

       Before I say  anything  about the government, let's establish a base
       for reasoning.

       All our ideas  should produce good  and  lasting  results  and  then
       anything that is good NOW would have been good in  the  PAST  and it
       will be good   in   the  FUTURE  and  it  will  be  good  UNDER  ANY
       CIRCUMSTANCES, so any idea that does  not  cover all this broad base
       IS NO GOOD.

       To be right, one's thought will have to be BASED ON  NATURAL  FACTS,
       for really, Mother  Nature  ONLY  can tell what is right and what is
       wrong and the way that things should be.

       My definition of right is that right  is  anything  in  nature  that
       exists without ARTIFICIAL MODIFICATION and all the others are wrong.

       Now suppose you would say it is wrong.  In that case,  I  would  say
       YOU are wrong  yourself  because  you  came  into this world through
       natural circumstances that YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH and so as long
       as such a thing exists as yourself,  I  am  right and you are wrong.
       Only those are right whose thoughts are BASED on natural  facts  and
       inclinations.

       It is a natural tendency for all living things to take it easy.  You
       watch any living thing you want to, and you will see that as soon as
       they FILL UP, they will LIE DOWN and TAKE IT EASY.

       The physical comfort, the ease, that is the only thing in this world
       that satisfies.  It  cannot  be  overdone and it is the real base of
       all our actions.

       We all cannot take things easy because there is too much competition
       from other people.   Only those who  possess  good  management  will
       succeed BY EXPLOITING domestic animals, machinery,  other people and
       natural resources.
                                      Page 1





       Everything will have  to  be  produced that is consumed and to those
       who have to produce the things themselves,  they  are  consuming the
       easy days which (are due them but) are not coming to them.

       It has been told to you that the government is for  the  purpose  of
       protecting "life" and   property,   but  it  really  IS  TO  PROTECT
       "PROPERTY" and life.

             NOBODY WANTS YOUR LIFE BUT EVERYBODY WANTS YOUR PROPERTY!

       In International dealings, when  an  army  conquers  the  land, they
       DON'T WANT THE PEOPLE, they want the PHYSICAL PROPERTY and so do the
       thieves and the bandits.  They want your money and  property  and IF
       YOU WILL SUBMIT PEACEFULLY, they won't harm you.

       Now you see, NOBODY WANTS YOU, they want your property so really the
       property is the  one that needs the protection and NOT YOU.  YOU ARE
       THE PROTECTOR YOURSELF.

       Government TO BE LASTING will have  to  be JUST.  This means it will
       have to protect  ALL  the property alike and all the  property  will
       have to pay  equal  taxes,  which means big property, big taxes, and
       small property, small taxes.

       Government CANNOT EXIST without taxes  so  only  those who pay taxes
       should vote and vote according to the taxes they pay.

       It is not sound to ALLOW THE WEAKLINGS TO VOTE.  Any  one who is too
       weak to MAKE  HIS  OWN  LIVING is not strong enough to vote, because
       their WEAK INFLUENCE  weakens the  state  and  a  degenerated  state
       cannot exist very long, but every state should be sound and lasting.

       By voting, the voters dictate the state's destiny for  times to come
       and then to  allow  such  a weak influence to guide the state, it is
       not wise and so you see one should  vote  according  to  how  HE  is
       carrying the State's burden. (the right to vote, not the # of votes)

       Another unwise thing about equal voting is that it gives the LOAFERS
       AND WEAKLINGS the  power  to TAKE PROPERTY AWAY from  PRODUCERS  and
       STRONGER PEOPLE, and another unjust thing about equal voting is that
       it gives the LOAFERS AND WEAKLINGS an EASY LIFE (leached)  FROM  the 
       (activities of the) producers and leaders.

       Self respecting producers will NOT STAND such an injustice for long.
       It is not the producer's fault when  one is too weak to MAKE HIS OWN
       LIVING.  The producer's life is just as sweet as the  weaklings  and
       loafers life is to them.

       All people are  independent  so  you see everybody will have to TAKE
       CARE OF THEMSELVES and IF THEY CANNOT,  THEY  SHOULD  PERISH and the
       sooner they perish THE BETTER IT WILL BE.

       To be lasting, the government should be built in the same way as the
       Supreme power of the land "the army."  Governments  have been rising
       and falling but the ARMY ALWAYS REMAINS.

       You know there  is  NO  EQUALITY  IN THE ARMY and so there can be NO
       EQUALITY IN THE STATE; if you are  not  AN EQUAL PRODUCER YOU CANNOT
       BE AN EQUAL CONSUMER.

       Fifty per cent  of  the  people  don't  want  to  lead, THEY WANT TO
       FOLLOW.  They want somebody else  to  furnish  the  money  for their
       living expenses and as long as such a condition exists, they are not
       equal with their leaders.

       That is the reason why everybody should be put in  the  right  place
       according to their physical ability and mental ability.

       There is only  one  way  to  share  the  National  income.  It is by
       sharing the production and if you  are  not  producing  equally  you
       cannot share equally.

                     NOBODY IS PRODUCING ANYTHING FOR OTHERS.

                      THEY ARE PRODUCING ONLY FOR THEMSELVES.

       People are INDIVIDUALS.  For instance, if you want an excitement you
       will have to TEST THE THRILL YOURSELF, or if you  have  a  pain  you
       will have to  BEAR IT YOURSELF, or if you want to eat, you will have
       to EAT FOR YOURSELF.

       Nobody can eat for you and so it is  that  if you want the things to
       eat you will have to produce them YOURSELF and IF YOU  ARE TOO WEAK,
       TOO LAZY, LACK  MACHINERY  and  GOOD MANAGEMENT to produce them, YOU
       SHOULD PERISH and that is all there is to it.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Vangard note...

            Altogether a rather harsh view of life.  We cannot deny that it
            does make sense when based on  Nature.  The strong survive, the
            weak perish or gravitate to their own level.

            The beauty of such thinking is that it reinforces  the  idea of
            PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY.

            That is  the  single GREATEST FAILURE OF MODERN SOCIETY to take
            into consideration.  The great  majority of people make excuses
            or try to pass the blame onto something "beyond"  their control
            or to another person or group.

            The Old  Testament clearly states "an eye for an eye" while the
            New Testament (see the excellent  paper  WHATIF  on KeelyNet by
            "Indiana Jones") gives the advice to "turn the other cheek."

            Look at  Nature and see how it works (and quite  successfully).
            Turn your  cheek  in  a  natural  environment  and  it  will be
            screwed, ripped off or eaten.   You  will  see  that  there  is
            little room  for  yielding  to  or  supporting   non-productive
            members of a community.

            Physical and  mental abilities should be continually worked on.
            As the Army says, "BE ALL THAT  YOU  CAN  BE."   Many  people's
            brains are like loose rubber bands lying on a  table, no mental
            tension except when FORCED and that sometimes fails.

            To quote  another,  "It  is EASY to DIE and very hard to live",
            well, by  the same token, it  is  much  easier  to  NOT  think,
            because it  is "understood" that someone will "compensate"  for
            failure through forgiveness or fudging the record.

                                      Page 3





            That way,   failures   generated  from  lack  of  attention  or
            concentration are  easily  excused  by  "I'm  Sorry".   Yet  it
            happens again and again and again.  The New Testament at work.

            The Japanese  do  not  allow  such  failures.  Although  termed
            "heathens" because  their  particular  religious beliefs do not
            coincide with the Christian  system,  they  are  nonetheless an
            admirable people.

            Look at what little they have to work with and  how  they  have
            dominoed it  into  a highly successful and influential country;
            mostly through the use of their minds and incredible will.

            The point of this little diatribe  is  that  we should all take
            PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY for our actions.  Stop  expecting to be
            forgiven for screwing up.

            Do not make mistakes and there will be no problem.  We will all
            advance and  succeed because we WILL not waste time or material
            which requires it to be made up or redone.

            Mistakes DO HAPPEN.  Once is  OK,  it  is  a  learning process.
            Twice, again  OK but needs reinforcement or retraining.   Three
            times and  there  is  a  problem  with  the process, the person
            attempting to carry out the process or the teaching method.

            Much of the civil problems now  going on in Dallas are directly
            caused by such LACK OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY.

            If people are not held ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS, they tend
            to act like rotating wheels slightly out of balance.   As  they
            continue to  rotate  with  no  correction of the slight wobble,
            they become aware of the FAILURE FOR CORRECTION and become ever
            more wobbly (outrageous) in their actions.

            Eventually, "influences" come  into  play  which  tragically or
            "justly" end the situation.  Unfortunately, the  windows of the
            event are  sometimes  so  wide  that  we  do  not see the FINAL
            retribution or compensation.   It  DOES  come about, though not
            ALWAYS within OUR window of observation.
