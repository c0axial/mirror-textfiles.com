                                Garden-shed genius
                                heads for the stars

                                by MICHAEL SHANAHAN


          Day trips to Australia and weekend jaunts in the Milky way could
       become a reality, thanks to the brainpower of Scottish inventor.

          Sandy Kidd's discovery, which is set to revolutionize travel,
       is already sending shock waves through the scientific establishment.
       One of Britain's top physicists described it "mind boggling."

          Mr. Kidd's work, researched in his garden shed, will make science
       fiction writers dreams come true. Trips to Mars will take 34 hours
       and the journey from London to Sydney will be reduced to a matter of
       minutes.

          The 51-year-old former apprentice toolmaker's development of a
       Gyroscopic Propulsion process   has  stunned  academics  because  it
       challenges Isaac Newton's Law of Motion.

          He has  worked  out  that, by setting  gyroscopes  at  particular
       angles, a lifting force that defies gravity is produced.

          Mr. Kidd,  who  worked  for five years on his brainchild  at  his
       Dundee home, is  now  moving  to  the heart of the space industry in
       California where a massive investment program is already underway.

          Dr. Harold Aspden senior visiting research fellow at Southampton
       University, has seen the results  of  early  tests.  "Scientifically
       speaking it is a bombshell," he says. I would not have believed this
       if I had not seen it with my own eyes.

          "It will totally revolutionize the travel industry. Taken to the
       ultimate, we will have planes without jet engines and helicopters
       without rotor blades."

          Mr. Kidd is being financed by an Australian research company. A

       spokesman said: "We  are  on to something really big. The next stage
       is to power up Sandy's device in  California  with  the  prospect of
       building a full-scale vehicle at the end of the day.  "Money  is  no
       object, but we are determined that his work will get out."

          At Imperial College, London, Professor Eric laithwaite, who has
       followed Mr. Kidd's experiments, said: "I have always been convinced
       it could be  done . . . and I like to see someone defeat the system.
       He may be a long time perfecting it but I sure he will succeed."

          Mr. Kidd made the final breakthrough  in this work highlighted in
       the Sunday Express last year, about four weeks ago  in  a Laboratory
       in Melbourne.

          "There was just one thing I couldn't understand," said the former
       RAF radar technician.   "I  had  worked round the problem until that
       day when it dawned on me.

                IF I COULD FIGURE IT OUT WHY HASN'T SOMEBODY ELSE?"
