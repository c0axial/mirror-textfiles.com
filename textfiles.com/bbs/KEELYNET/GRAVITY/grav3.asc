       Abstract:

       Are gravitational waves  the  source of noise in electronic devices?
       The author believes so, and describes a simple circuit to detect the
       waves.

       The author has developed a new cosmology that predicts the existance
       of a new  type  of gravitational  signal.   We  are  publishing  the
       results of some of his experiments in the hope that  it  will  foter
       experimentation as well as alternate explanations for his results.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Einstein predicted the  existence of gravity waves - the counterpart
       of light and radio waves - many years  ago.   However,  he predicted
       the existence of  quadrature-type gravity waves.  Unfortunately,  no
       one has been able to detect quadrature-type gravity waves.

       Consequently, the author developed, over the years, a new cosmology,
       or theory of  the  universe,  in  which  monopole  gravity waves are
       predicted.  The author's theory does  not  preclude the existence of
       Einsteinian gravity waves,  but they are viewed as  being  extremely
       weak, very long  in  wavelength,  and  therefore  very  difficult to
       detect unequivocally.  Monopole  signals,  however,  are  relatively
       strong, so they are much more easily detected.

       Monopole gravity waves have been detected for many  years; it's just
       that we've been used to calling them 1/f "noise" signals or flicker
       noise.  Those noise signals can be seen in low-frequency electronic
       circuits.  More recently, such signals have been called Microwave
       Background Radiation (MBR);  most  scientists  believe  that to be a
       relic of the so-called "big bang" that created the universe.

       In the author's  cosmology, the  universe  is  considered  to  be  a
       finite, spherical, closed  system; in other words,  it  is  a  black
       body.

       Monopole gravity waves  "propagate"  any  distance  in  Planck time,
       which is about  10^-44  seconds;   hence,   their   effects   appear
       everywhere almost instantaneously.  The sum total of background flux


                                      Page 1





       in the universe gives rise to the observed microwave temperature, in
       our universe, of about three degrees kelvin.

       Sources of monopole   gravity  waves  include  common  astrophysical
       phenomena like supernovas,  novas,  starquakes,  etc.,  as  well  as
       earthly phenomena like  earthquakes,  core  movements,  etc.   Those
       sorts of cosmic   and  earthly  events  cause  delectable  temporary
       variations in the amount of gravitational-impule  radiation  present
       in the universe.

       Novas, especially supernovas (which are large exploding  stars), are
       very effective generators of oscillatory monopole gravity waves.

       Those signals have a Gaussian waveshape and a lifetime of only a few
       tens of milliseconds.   They  can  readily impart a portion of their
       energy to free particles like molecules, atoms, and electrons.

       The background flux, in general, is  fairly constant.  Variations in
       the backgrouns flux   are  caused  by  movements   of   large   mass
       concentrations like galaxies, super-galaxies, and black holes.

       These movements create gravitational "shadows," analogous to optical
       shadows.  When the  earth-moon-sun  alignment  is  just  right,  the
       gravtational shadow of a small, highly  concentrated mass -- a black
       hole, for example  -- can be detected and tracked  from  the  Earth.
       So, keeping those  facts  in  mind,  let's look at several practical
       methods of detecting gravitational energy.

       Electrons and Capacitors
       ------------------------

       As stated above, gravity-wave energy can be imparted to ordinary
       objects.  Of special interest to us  are the loosely-bound electrons
       in ordinary capacitors.  Perhaps you have wondered how a discharged
       high-valued electrolytic capacitor  (say 1000 uF at  35  volts)  can
       develop a charge  even  though it is disconnected from an electrical
       circuit.

       While some of  that  charging could  be  attributed  to  a  chemical
       reaction in the capacitor, I believe that much of it is caused by
       gravity-wave impulses bathing the capacitor at all  times.   And the
       means by which  gravity  waves transfer energy is similar to another
       means of energy transfer that is  well  known  to  readers of Radio-
       Electronics: the electric field.

       As shown in Fig. 1-a, the presence of a large mass  near  the plates
       of a capacitor  causes a polarized alignment of the molecules in the
       capacitor, as though an external DC voltage had been applied to the
       capacitor, as shown in Fig. 1-b.

       You can verify that yourself:

              Drop a   fully-discharged   1000-uF,   35-volt   electrolytic
              capacitor broadside on a hard surface from a height of
              two or three feet.

              Then measure the voltage across the capacitor  with  a  high-
              impedance voltmeter.


                                      Page 2





              You will  find  a  voltage  of  about  10 to 50 mV.  Drop the
              capacitor several times on opposite sides, don't let it
              bounce, and note how charge  builds  up to a saturation level
              that may be as high as one volt.

       In that experiment,  the  energy  of  free-fall  is   converted   to
       polarization energy in  the  capacitor.  The loosely-bound electrons
       are literally "jarred" into new polarization positions.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Vangard note...

           We must be careful before jumping  to  such  conclusions without
           regard for  the  more  natural  property  of the  piezo-electric
           effect.  Capacitor  construction  can  consist  of  a variety of
           materials, many of which include  a  metal  foil.  Note that all
           metal has a crystalline structure, therefore, all metals to some
           degree possess piezo-electric properties.

           The Piezo-electric property is most easily demonstrated  by  the
           use of  any  crystal,  most  commonly quartz.  When a crystal is
           subjected to  bursts of electrical  energy  occurring  at  sonic
           rates, the  crystal  will  convert  the electrical  energy  into
           mechanical movement  which then percusses the air at the rate of
           the electrical frequencies, i.e. a speaker.

           The inverse of this process can  be  used  to convert mechanical
           pressure into  electrical energy.  Any abrupt  mechanical  shock
           applied to  the  crystal  will  therefore produce electricity, a
           process Keely referred to as "shock excitation."

           In regard to the dropping of the capacitor to allow it to strike
           the floor, the question follows, is the striking on the floor in
           actuality converting the abrupt mechanical shock into electrical
           energy which then does not bleed off until discharged?

           If in fact the movement of a capacitor through space will induce
           a charge on the plates of the  capacitor,  then  we can see some
           interesting possibilities.  Most important of all  the direction
           towards a  free  energy  device  using  the  moving  plates of a
           capacitor.  Maybe this is the  secret  of the Testatika, the M-L
           convertor and others which use electrostatic chopping.

           A more  interesting experiment, indeed, a proof  of  the  claim,
           would be to spin one or more capacitors at various diameters and
           speeds and  monitor the developed voltage.  This could very well
           lead to some quantitative observations.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       In a similar  manner,  gravitational   impulses   from  space  "jar"
       electrons into new polarization positions.

       Here's another experiment:

              Monitor a  group  of  similar  capacitors that  have  reached
              equilibrium conditions   while   being   bathed   by   normal
              background gravitational impulses.

              You'll observe that, over a period of time, the voltage

                                      Page 3




              across all those open-circuited capacitors will be equal, and
              that it will depend only on the average background flux at
              the time.   Temperature  should  be  kept  constant  for that
              experiment.

       I interpret those facts to mean that  a  capacitor develops a charge
       that reflects the  monopole  gravity-wave signals existing  at  that
       particular location in  the  universe.   So, although another device
       could be used, we will use a capacitor as the sensing element in the
       gravity-wave detectors described next.

       The simplest detector
       ---------------------

       Monopole gravity waves generate small  impulse  currents that may be
       coupled to an  op-amp configured as a current-to-voltage  converter,
       as shown in  Fig.  2.   The current-to-voltage converter is a nearly
       lossless current-measuring device.

       It gives an output voltage that is  proportional  to  the product of
       the input current  (which  can  be  in  the  picoampere  range)  and
       resistor R1.  Linearity  is  assured  because  the  non-DC-connected
       capacitor maintains the op-amp's input terminals at virtual ground.

       The detector's output may be coupled  to a high-impedance digital or
       analog voltmeter, an  audio  amplifier,  or  an  oscilloscope.    In
       addition, a chart  recorder  could  be  used to record the DC output
       over a period of time, thus providing a record of long-term "shadow-
       drift" effects.

       Resistor R2 and capacitor C2 protect  the  output  of  the  circuit;
       their values will depend on what you're driving.  To experiment, try
       a 1k resistor and a 0.1 uF capacitor.

       The output of  the detector (Eo) may appear in two forms,  depending
       on whether or  not  stabilizing  capacitor Cx is connected.  When it
       is, the output will be highly amplified  1/f noise signals, as shown
       in Fig. 3-a.

       Without Cx, the circuit becomes a "ringing" circuit  with  a slowly-
       decaying output that  has a resonant frequency of 500-600 Hz for the
       component values shown.  In that  configuration,  the  circuit  is a
       Quantum Non-Demolition (QND) circuit, as astrophysicists call it; it
       will now actually display the amplitude variations  (waveshapes)  of
       the passing gravitational-impulse bursts, as shown in Fig. 3-b.

       An interesting variation  on the detector may be built by increasing
       the value of sensing capacitor C1  to  about  1000-1600  uF.   After
       circuit stability is  achieved, the circuit will respond  to  almost
       all gravity-wave signals in the universe.  By listening carefully to
       the audio output  of  the  detector you can hear not only normal 1/f
       noise, but also many "musical" sounds  of  space,  as  well as other
       effects that will not be disclosed here.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Vangard note...

              Several years  earlier, Hodowanec was claiming  that  he  had
              actually made  contact  with  someone on the planet Mars.  He
              said the signals eventually evolved into intelligible


                                      Page 4





              patterns which  indicated  there was a decimated civilization
              still in existence on the planet.

              We have the papers and will  list them in the near future for
              those who might be interested...this is what  he refers to in
              the comment  "other  effects that will not be disclosed here"
              and was due to the national  nature  of the magazine in which
              the article was published.

              He says a cone of receptivity from or to Mars  was the reason
              that the  signals could only be detected at certain locations
              on either planet.  In other  words,  you must be in the right
              place at  the right time and with the right  equipment.   The
              signals essentially used modulated gravitational waves.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       An improved detector
       --------------------

       Adding a buffer  stage  to  the  basic circuit, as shown in Fig.  4,
       makes the detector easier to work  with.   The  IC  used is a common
       1458 (which is a dual 741).  One op-amp is used as the detector, and
       the other op-amp multiplies the detector's output by a factor of 20.
       Potentiometer R3 is used to adjust the output to the desired level.

       When used unshielded,  the  circuits  presented here  are  not  only
       sensitive detectors of   gravitational   impulses,   but   also   of
       *electromagnetic* signals ranging from 50-500 GHz!  Hence, these
       circuits could be used to detect  many  types  of signals, including
       radar signals.

       To detect only  gravity  waves, and not EMI, the circuit  should  be
       shielded against all  electromagnetic  radiation.  Both circuits are
       low in cost and easy to build.  Assembly  is  non-critical, although
       proper wiring practices should be followed.

       Initially, you should  use the op-amps specified;  don't  experiment
       with other devices  until  you  attain satisfactory results with the
       devices called for.  Later you can experiment with other components,
       like low-power op-amps, especially  CMOS  types,  which  have diodes
       across their inputs to protect them against high input voltages.

       Those diodes make  them  much  less  sensitive  to   electromagnetic
       radiation, so circuits  that use those devices may be used to detect
       gravity-waves without shielding.

       The circuit in Fig. 4 is the QND or  ringing  type, but the feedback
       resistance is variable from 0.5 to 2 megohms.  That  allows  you  to
       tune the circuit to the natural oscillating frequency of different
       astrophysical events.

       Huge supernova bursts, for example, have much larger amplitudes, and
       much lower frequencies  of  oscillation  than  normal supernovas and
       novas.  Hence you can tune the detector for the supernova burst rate
       that interests you.  With the component values given in Fig.  4, the
       resonant frequency of the circuitcan  be  varied between 300-900 Hz.
       The circuit of Fig. 4, or a variant thereof, was used to obtain all
       the experimental data discussed below.

                                      Page 5





       In addition, the  circuits that we've described in this article were
       built in an aluminum chassis and then  located  within an additional
       steel box to  reduce  pickup  of  stray  EMI.   Power   and   output
       connections were made through filter-type feedthrough capacitors.

       In the QND   mode,  coupling  the  detector's  output  to  an  audio
       amplifier and an  oscilloscope  gives  impressive  sound  and  sight
       effects.

       Fluctuations generally reflect passing gravitational  shadows.   The
       author has taken  much  data  of  the  sort  to  be discussed; let's
       examine a few samples of that data  to  indicate the kind of results
       you can expect, and ways of interpreting those results.

       Sample scans
       ------------

       Shown in Fig.  5 is an unusual structure that was  repeated  exactly
       the next day,  but  four  minutes earlier.  The pattern was followed
       for several weeks, moving four minutes earlier per day.

       That confirms the  observation  that   the  burst  response  of  the
       detector was related to our location on earth with  respect  to  the
       rest of the   universe.    The   change  of  four  minutes  per  day
       corresponds with the relative movements  of  the  earth and the body
       that was casting the "shadow."

       The plot of Fig. 6 appears to be a supernova, probably  in  our  own
       galaxy, caught in the act of exploding.  The plot of Fig. 7 was made
       four days after  another supernova explosion; that plot reveals that
       that supernova left  a  well-developed   black   hole   and   "ring"
       structure.

       You may find it interesting to consider that visual  indications  of
       those supernovas will  not  be  seen for several thousand years!  As
       such, it might  be  "quite  a  while"   before   we   get  a  visual
       confirmation of our suspected supernova!

       Last, Fig. 8 shows a plot of the moon's gravitational  shadow during
       the eclipse of  May  30,  1984.   Note that the gravitational shadow
       preceded the optical shadow by about eight minutes!

       That gives credence  to  our  claim   that   gravitational   effects
       propagate instantaneously.  Relatedly, but not shown  here,  a  deep
       shadow is consistently  detected  whenever  the center of the galaxy
       appears on the meridian (180 degrees)  hinting of the existence of a
       "black hole" in that region.

       Conclusions
       -----------

       In this article we discussed the highlights of a new  theory  of the
       universe that predicts the existence of monopole gravity waves.  We
       then presented details  of  a  circuit  that  can  be used to detect
       monopole gravity waves.

       The author has monitored those signals for ten years so is confident
       that you will be able to duplicate  those results.  Needless to say,
       the subject of gravity waves is a largely unexplored  one, and there
       is much yet to be learned.

       Perhaps this article   will   inspire  you  to  contribute  to  that
       knowledge.  In your  experiments,  you  might  consider  trying  the
       following: Operate several detector circuits at the  same  time  and
       record the results.

       Separate the detectors  --  even  by  many  miles --and record their
       outputs.  In such experiments, the  author  found that the circuits'
       outputs were very similar.  Those results would seem  to  count  out
       local EMI or pure random noise as the cause of the circuit response.

       W.H.  Freeman and  Co.,  1973.   Also,  the article,  "Quantum  Non-
       Demolition Measurements" in  _Science_,  Volume  209,  August 1 1980
       contains useful information on the  QND  type  of  measurement  used
       here.

       Sidebar: Rhysmonic Cosmology

       Ancient and Renaissance physicists postulated the  existence  of  an
       all-pervasive medium they  called  the _ether_.  Since the advent of
       sub-atomic physics and relativity, theories of the ether have fallen
       into disuse.

       Rhysmonic cosmology postulates the  existence of rhysmons, which are
       the fundamental particles of nature, and which pervade the universe,
       as does the ether.

       Each rhysmon has  the  attributes  of  size,  shape,  position,  and
       velocity; rhysmons are arranged in space in a matrix structure, the
       density of which varies according to position in the universe.

       The matrix structure  of  rhysmons  in  free space gives rise to the
       fundamental units of length, time,  velocity, mass, volume, density,
       and energy discovered by physicist Max Planck.

       Fundamental postulates of the Rhysmonic Universe can  be  summarized
       as follows:

               o The universe is finite and spherical
               o Euclidean  geometry  is  sufficient  to describe Rhysmonic
                 Space.
               o The edge of the universe is a perfect reflector of energy.
               o Matter forms only in the central portion of the universe.

       The matrix structure   of   rhysmons    allows   the   instantaneous
       transmission of energy  along  a  straight  line, called  an  energy
       vector, from the  point of origin to the edge of the universe, where
       it would be reflected according  to  laws  similar  those  giverning
       spherical optics.

       In Rhysmonic Cosmology,  mass, inertia, and energy  are  treated  as
       they are in  classical  mechanics.   Mass  arises,  according to the
       author, because "particles in rhysmonic cosmology must be the result
       of changes in the `density' of the  rhysmonic  structure,  since the
       universe is nothing more than rhysmons and the void."

       In a "dense" area of the universe, such as the core of a particle, a
       number of rhysmons are squeezed togther.  This means that every

                                      Page 7





       particle has a    correlating   anti-particle,   or   an   area   of
       correspondingly low density.  In addition,  a particle has an excess
       of outward-directed energy  vectors,  and  an anti-particle  has  an
       excess of inward-directed energy vectors.  Those vectors are what we
       usually call electric charge.

       Gravity is not  a  force  of attraction between objects; rather, two
       objects are impelled towards each  other by energy vectors impinging
       on the surfaces of those objects that do not face each other.

       Netwon's laws of  gravitation  hold,  although their  derivation  is
       different than in Newton's system.

       Gravitational waves arise  in various ways, but, in general, a large
       astronomical disturbance, such as  the  explosion  of  a  supernova,
       instantaneously modulates the   rhysmonic  energy   vectors.    That
       modulation might then  appear,  for  example,  superimposed  on  the
       Earth's gravitaional-field flux --  and  it  would  be detectable by
       circuits like those described here.
