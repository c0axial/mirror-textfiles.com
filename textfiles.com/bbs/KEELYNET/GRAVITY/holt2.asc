Jerry,

The following I found in one of Bill Beaty's files on gravity.  Thought you
might be interested.  Sounds like Nasa gets into some interesting stuff.
                                                                       Dan

I have recently come into possession of a paper on magneto-gravitics and field
resonance systems, presented by A.C. Holt from NASA Johnson Space Center to
the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics' 16th Joint Propulsion
Conference, June 30-July 2, 1980.

Holt presents a project using an already existing system known as the Coherent
Field and Energy Resonance System (CoFERS) [probably located at Los Alamos
Labs' High Magnetic Field Research Laboratory].

CoFERS utilizes a toroidal-shaped energy guide with megagauss magnetic field
sources located along radius vectors equally spaced around the toroid.

CoFERS is shaped like a thick flying disc. Holt goes on to say:

   "By converging an object's normal space-time energy pattern to an energy
    pattern which differs substantially from the normal pattern, the
    gravitational forces acting on the object are changed.  The object's new
    pattern interacts with the surrounding space-time and virtual energy
    patterns, such that the interactive forces are substantially altered.

    The alteration of the characteristics of the continuous field of force
    results in the apparent motion of the object *through space-time*." [...]

    "Since the gravitational forces acting on the propulsion system can be
     quickly altered to achieve the desired motion, the *spacecraft* can make
     right-angle turns at very-high velocities without adversely affecting the
     crew or system elements. The effective gravitational field the
     *spacecraft/ aircraft* experiences can be nearly simultaneously
     reoriented at a 90- degree angle, resulting in a smooth continuous motion
     as far as the  occupants are concerned." [ ... ]

     "The gravimagnetic system is perhaps  best suited for use in and around
      ... a large mass such as the Earth."

     "While the gravimagnetic system is likely to be the first field-dependent
      propulsion system developed, the field resonance system will **bring
      stellar and galactic travel out of the realm of science fiction**.

     "The field resonance system artificially generates an energy pattern
      which precisely matches or resonates with a virtual pattern associated
      with a distent space-time point. According to the model, if a
      fundamental or precise resonance is established, (using hydromagnetic
      wave fine-tuning techniques), the spacecraft will be very strongly and
      equally repelled by surrounding virtual patterns.

     "At the same time, through the virtual many-dimensional structure of
      space-time, a very strong attraction with the virtual pattern of a
      distant space-time point will exist. ...this combination of very strong
      forces will result in the trans-location of the spacecraft from its
      initial position through the many-dimensional virtual structure to the
      distant space-time point. [ ... ]

     "A space-time 'jump' already appears to be supported by astrophysical
      research."
