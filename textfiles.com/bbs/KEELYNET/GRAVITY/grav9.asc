               This file  is  from  a  newspaper  article  describing  J.G.

                     Gravitational Laser Shoots Through Walls
                                  by John H. Lyst

       Later this month   near   Atlanta,   an   Indianapolis   electronics
       specialist will demonstrate   what   he  calls  the   world's   fist
       gravitational laser.

       The occasion will  be  the  annual  meeting  of  the  United  States
       Psychotronic Association.  The   electronics   specialist   is  J.G.
       Gallimore and the  laser  he  perfected from a few  hundred  dollars
       worth of special  parts,  projects  not light from its clear plastic
       barrel, but what Gallimore identifies as neutrinos.

       Such shooting gravity waves know no  walls, says Gallimore, and they
       can be sent  through thick concrete or the earth itself,  suggesting
       that a similar  laser  might,  among  other  things,  be  a  PERFECT
       COMMUNICATION DEVICE for the future.

       According to Gallimore,  a  nationally   recognized  leader  in  the
       esoteric subject of Radionics, the mathematics behind  the invention
       helps solve some  questions  posed by James Clerk Maxwell, a British
       physicist of the 1800s whose theories  of  electromagnetism laid the
       foundation for modern radio, television and radar.

       While the Gallimore experimental laser may sound  as  wild  as radar
       must have seemed in Maxwell's day, what has fast become conventional
       laser technology today  was  regarded  only a few years ago as being
       closer to science fiction than reality.

       Lasers are widely used industrial  tools  and are now even being put
       to work in entertainment and advertising as well as  engineering and
       scientific research.

       Western Electric, one  of  the  leaders  in  laser research and use,
       likes to say that it and Bell Laboratories  brought the laser out of
       science fiction into the factory.

       Lasers went to work for W.E. in 1965 drilling holes  in diamond dies
       used in wiring  technology.   Now  about  200 lasers are used by the
       firm in more than 25 manufacturing applications.

       Western spokesmen say  that  aside  from doing previously impossible
       work, lasers are doing routine tasks faster, safer, cheaper and more
       efficiently than conventional equipment.

       Engineers at Western say the laser  has  four  characteristics which
       give it a big edge as a production boost.

       First a laser beam can be focused to form a tiny  spot  one  million
       times more intense  than  a  similar size spot on the surface of the
       sun - hot enough to drill, cut or melt any material known to man.

       The second asset  is  that  the  resulting  spot  of  light  can  be
       positioned and controlled  by  computers  giving   the  laser  great
       precision and capability for automation.

       A third characteristic  is that a laser's wavelength can be tuned to
       the material being worked so that it does a job far more efficiently
       than possible with a conventional tool.

       Fourth is the thing engineers say may be the most important - lasers
       can work in areas where only light  can  pass, such as inside sealed
       glass enclosures.

       The laser beam is already making appearances on musical  stages with
       rock bands and  other  groups  among the first to use laser lighting
       effects to heighten the mood of music.

       A New York firm, Laser Physics, Ltd.,  is  among  the  leading firms
       pioneering laser lighting in advertising and marketing, using lasers
       to display nighttime  messages  on  clouds  in a manner  similar  in
       effects to daytime planes using smoke trails for skywriting.

       Some see lasers for eventual use on animated billboards.

       Laser Physic's first  sale of an advertising laser, according to the
       firm, was to  a  third  world national  political  party  which  the
       company says it is not yet permitted to identify.

       Speaking of his  so-called gravitational laser, Gallimore  says  the
       device may have  the capability of scientific measurement of psychic
       powers claimed by  some  individuals   sucha   as   faith   healers.
       Gallimore is among those who believe such powers may  relate  to the
       production of gravity  waves  whose  characteristics are similar, he
       says, to light waves.
