                                 Conquest of Space

       There is a  good  chance  that the rocket will be obsolete for space
       travel within 50 years.  Some of us  have  been concentrating on the
       development of the  rocket  as the possible power  plant  for  outer
       space propulsion.  We've  fired  a lot of them and we've proved that
       they will work in outer space.   We've  also  learned  a  lot  about
       what's out there by using rockets.  And probably  we  will  take the
       first few faltering steps into space with rocket power plants.

       But recent discoveries indicate that the spaceship of the future may
       be powered by  anti-gravity  devices.  These, instead of using brute
       force to overcome gravity, will use the force of gravity itself much
       as an airplane uses the air to make it fly.

       Sir William Crookes,  the  English   scientist   who  developed  the
       cathode-ray tube we   now   use   for  television,  made   extensive
       investigations of levitation  phenomena - a field that once belonged
       to vaudeville magicians.

       Scientists, reasoning that if they  believed  his  reports  of weird
       green glows in  vacuum  tubes  they should also look  into  Crookes'
       LEVITATION STUDIES, have been making slow but steady progress.

       Others have been  investigating the fields of GRAVITIC ISOTOPES, JET
       ELECTRON STREAMS and the MECHANICS OF THE ELECTRON SHELLS OF ATOMS.

       Townsend T. Brown, an American investigator,  has  gone even further
       than that.  There are rumors that Brown has developed  a  real anti-
       gravity machine.  There  are  many  firms working on the problems of
       anti-gravity - the  Glenn  L. Martin  Co.,  Bell  Aircraft,  General
       Electric, Sperry-Rand Corp. and others.

       Rumors have been  circulating  that  scientists  have   built   disc
       airfoils TWO FEET  IN  DIAMETER  incorporating  a  VARIATION  OF THE
       SIMPLE TWO-PLATE ELECTRICAL   CONDENSOR   (..capacitor...),   which,
       charged to a potential of 50,000 volts has achieved  a  SPEED  OF 17
       FEET PER SECOND with a TOTAL ENERGY INPUT OF 50 WATTS.

       A three-foot diameter  disc  airfoil charged to 150 Kilovolts turned
       out such an amazing performance that THE WHOLE THING WAS IMMEDIATELY
       CLASSIFIED.

       FLAME-JET GENERATORS, making   use   of   the  electrostatic  charge
       discovered in rocket exhausts, have been developed which will supply
       charges UP TO 15 MILLION VOLTS.

       Several important things have been discovered with regard to gravity
       propulsion.  For one, the propulsive  force  doesn't act on only one
       part of the  ship  it  is pushing; it ACTS ON ALL PARTS  WITHIN  THE
       GRAVITY FIELD created by the gravitic drive.

       It probably IS NOT LIMITED TO THE SPEED OF LIGHT.

       Gravity-powered vehicles have    apparently    changed    direction,
       accelerated rapidly at very high  g's  and  stopped abruptly WITHOUT
       ANY HEAVY STRESSES BEING EXPERIENCED by the measuring devices aboard
       the vehicle and within the gravity-propulsion field.

       This control is  done  by  changing  the  direction,  intensity  and
       polarity of the  charge on the condenser plates of the drive unit, a
       fairly simple task for scientists.

       Sounds incredible, doesn't  it?   But  the  information  comes  from
       reliable sources.  We   are   licking  the  problems   of   gravity.
       Indications are that  we  are  on  the  verge of tapping a BRAND NEW
       GROUP OF ELECTRICAL WAVES WHICH LINK ELECTRICITY AND GRAVITY.

       Electronic engineers have taken the electrical coil and used it as a
       link between electricity and electro-magnetism,  thus  giving  us  a
       science of electro-magnetics which in turn has given  us such things
       as radio, television, radar and the like.

       Now, gravity researchers  seem to think that the condenser will open
       up the science  of  electro-gravitics.   Soon  we  may  be  able  to
       eliminate gravity as a structural, dynamic and medical problem.

       Although we will  probably  use  rocket  power  to  make  our  first
       explorations into space,  the  chances are now pretty good that this
       will not always be the case.  In 50 years we may travel to the moon,
       the planets or even the stars propelled  by  the harnessed forces of
       gravity.

       If this seems fantastic, remember that the rocket and  the idea of a
       trip to the  moon  was  fantastic 20 years ago.  Fifty years ago the
       idea of commercial air travel was utter nonsense.

       With gravitic spaceships, we may travel  to the moon in less than an
       hour, to the  planets in less than a day or to the stars  themselves
       in a matter  of months.  We may be able to do it in absolute comfort
       without the problems of zero-gravity or high accelerations.

       The idea of  the rocket becoming  obsolete  is  not  a  happy  idea,
       particularly when so  much  work has been done on rockets.   But  we
       have worked on  rockets  because we believed they were the only type
       of power plant capable of working in outer space.

       If a better method comes along,  why  shed  tears?   After  all, our
       basic goal is  to travel and explore in space and  it  doesn't  make
       much difference how we do it.
