       Walter Wright is  a very good friend of ours here at KeelyNet and we
       have finally gotten around to getting  some  of his papers typed up.
       Walter has been  actively researching the PUSH gravity  concept  and
       has developed some astounding physical models to prove his point.

       When we first  heard  of  him  and  his  claims, we had some trouble
       believing.  But after  seeing  his  videos  we  changed  our  minds.
       Walter was kind  enough to allow me to visit his home  and  workshop
       where I was  further stimulated to get his work out to the public to
       the best of the ability of KeelyNet.   Surprisingly enough, the more
       advanced researchers tend  to  support  the  PUSH  gravity  concept,
       particularly the Tachyon field theories of Nieper.

       One of the  first arguments against Push Gravity is that if true, we
       would all be pushed off the planet,  however, Walter only claims the
       PUSH concept to be valid in regard to CELESTIAL BODIES.

       We also ask  you  to  keep  in mind that Walter NEVER  claimed  that
       gravity is magnetic  in  nature.   He  finds  that  magnetic  fields
       exhibit the push/pull characteristics which most closely emulate the
       effects of the pushing energy known as gravity.

       At the outset,  we  give  you Walters  address,  since  he  is  most
       interested in hearing  from  people interested in the  PUSH  GRAVITY
       theory.  Walter also  has published a book "Gravity is a Push" which
       you can buy through the mail for $12  postpaid.   If you do write to
       Walter, please tell  him  you  found  out  about  his  work  through
       KeelyNet, we would appreciate it.  THANKS....Jerry, Ron and Chuck...

       The following text was written by Walter Wright in the early 1980's.

       A few thoughts by the author in passing...

         I believe  when  you  read  my theory with an "OPEN MIND" that you
         will see through it readily.  When you try to present this subject
         to the right people it is almost  an impossibility.  They are more
         interested in "WHO YOU ARE" rather than what do you have to offer.
         To me this is "SICK".

         That man  that  is  a  mechanic is never supposed to have any good
         ideas about baking and a baker isn't  supposed to be able to offer
         any good advice to a mechanic.  I believe all of  us here on earth
         have at  least  one  good idea to offer SOCIETY and I believe that
         this idea should be checked out by the experts to the fullest.

         I would appreciate a letter from  you  to  me  to let me know just
         what your opinion on this theory is.  I am well aware of the fact,
         that when you have something new to offer in an old  subject, that
         you are  asking  for your head to be chopped off.  I am not afraid
         of the ax.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       I made world news in March, 1979, when UPI wrote the following under
       a large caption of "MAN'S THEORY  OF  GRAVITY  IS  'PUSHING' AND NOT
       'PULLING'."

          FAIRFIELD (UPI) -- A retired railroad signalman  and  self-taught
          physicist says  Sir  Isaac  Newton drew the wrong conclusion when
          the apple of destiny plopped on his head almost 300 years ago.

          Walter Wright, 60, says he isn't  arguing  that  gravity  doesn't
          exist, only that it works in reverse from the way  Newton thought
          - by "pushing" objects apart rather than "pulling" them together.

          "Gravity isn't  a  pulling  force,"  Wright  says.  "If bodies in
          space were attracted to one another,  they'd always be colliding.
          But that doesn't happen."  (Walter calls this the bunch-of-grapes
          theory since if Gravity truly attracted, then  all  masses  would
          clump together into one giant cluster of grapes.)

          Wright's basic  idea  --  which  he  says  is  borne  out  by his
          experiments and calculations --  is  that gravity doesn't emanate
          from the earth's core, it comes from the sun.

          He argues that the sun, because it is a huge mass  in  a constant
          state of combustion, emits forces which push or "squeeze" objects
          toward the earth -- like Newton's apple.

          If the  40-year  veteran  of  Southern  Pacific railroad yards is
          correct, of course, his ideas  would  put  him  in  a  class with
          Copernicus, Darwin  and  Einstein.  And after all,  Einstein  was
          only a   postal  clerk  when  he  wrote  his  General  Theory  of
          Relativity.

          Wright's gray-shingled home in  this  small  Northern  California
          town overflows with black boxes housing small magnets  that spin,
          twist and  roll and, he says, demonstrate the illogic of Newton's
          ideas.

          He uses galaxies passing through  each  other in deep space as an
          illustration of  his  ideas.   The  stars usually  don't  collide
          because they REPEL or PUSH EACH OTHER APART, he said.

          Wright's views are understandably unpopular with some physicists,
          although he  says  one mathematician who attended a demonstration
          of his theories told him his ideas  were  just  as  valid as most
          accepted theories of physics.



                                      Page 2





          "Other scientists  tell  me they don't believe me, but they can't
          disprove my theories," Wright said.

          Physics Professor  Eugene  D.   Commins   at  the  University  of
          California, who knew Einstein personally, called  the  notion  of
          push-gravity "totally  false.  I say that without qualification."
          He said  where Newtonian physics  doesn't  explain  gravitational
          forces, Einstein's General Relativity theory does.

          Wright is unfazed, particularly since his novel  ideas  have made
          him a  sort  of  guru to what he calls his "following" of teenage
          science students, sci-fi fans and  even  some physical scientists
          he calls "unbrainwashed" by Newtonian physics.

          He said  the New York-based Carlton Press plans  to  publish  his
          book, "Gravity  is a Push," in the next two months.  In the book,
          Wright claims, he succeeds where  Einstein failed - in developing
          a unified field theory.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       On September 10, 1979, I presented my physical models on Channel 13,
       KOVR, for a full hour on a program called "Morning  Scene"  and here
       is a letter I received from Chet Casselman who hosted the program :

          Dear Walter,
               I just   want   to  know  how  pleased  we  were  with  your
          performance on  "Morning  Scene"   the  other  day.   It  was  an
          excellent presentation  of  a number of simple demonstrations  of
          some pretty  complicated  theories.   I have to say your theories
          were not only 'interesting', but  made  VERY GOOD SENSE, TOO.  We
          got some  very  intriguing  questions  on  the   air  after  your
          exhibits, I  thought,  and  you handled the questions quite well.
          As a matter of fact, we're still  getting  phone  inquiries  from
          viewers who want to know how to get in touch with  you  or  where
          they can  find a copy of your book "Gravity Is a Push".  Maybe we
          can get you back for another visit  one  day.  Thanks again for a
          very stimulating program.
                                                          Chet Casselman
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       From the World Book Encyclopedia copyrighted in 1938:

          "The sun pulls the earth with 175 times the force  that  the moon
           does."

       In order for  physicists  to account for the Newton Theory that says
       the moon pulls the earth with twice  the  force  that  the sun does,
       here is their explanation in the Americana Encyclopedia, page 613 in
       Volume 27 under "TIDES" that was copyrighted in 1965.

          "A slight modification to Newton's law occurs in  the mathematics
           of this problem."

       If you change  the  pull  of the sun from 175 times greater than the
       pull of the moon mathematically,  to  end  up saying the pull of the
       sun is only  HALF  as  much  as  the moon and call  that  a  "slight
       modification," then I  believe  you  can sell gas to the Arabs for 5
       bucks a gallon.

       At Calumet, Michigan,  in  1901 they took two piano wires 4,250 feet
       long plumb bobs attached and dropped them down two mine shafts 4,250
       feet apart.  They expected the pull of gravity, which is supposed to
       be in the center of the earth, to  pull  these two plumb bobs closer
       together.  Much to their surprise they found out  the  wires  at the
       bottom WERE FURTHER  APART than they were at the top.  This led them
       to believe that:

          "Maybe there is no such thing as MASS ATTRACTION."

       The above science subjects provides me with more evidence to be even
       a bigger "NON-BELIEVER" in the Newtonian Gravity theory.

          April 27,  1979...Washington   (UPI)  --  "UNIVERSE  WILL  EXPAND
          FOREVER."...New evidence  supports  the  idea the  universe  will
          continue to EXPAND FOREVER and escape contraction to a BIG CRUNCH
          billions of years from now," said Dr. Giaconni of the Smithsonian
          Astrophysical Observatory.

       That kind of puts a damper on Newton's PULL THEORY.

       From a book called "PSYCO-CYBERNETICS" by Maltz, M.D., F.I.C.S.

          "Any breakthrough  in  science is likely to come from OUTSIDE the
          system.  Experts  are  the  most   familiar  with  the  developed
          knowledge INSIDE THE PRESCRIBED BOUNDARIES of a given science.

          Any new  knowledge  must  usually come from the OUTSIDE...not  by
          experts but by what someone has defined as an INPERT."

       Pasteur was NOT  an  M.D.  The Wright Brothers were NOT aeronautical
       engineers, but BICYCLE MECHANICS.   Einstein, properly speaking, was
       NOT a physicist   but   a  mathematician.   Yet  his   findings   in
       mathematics completely turned  upside  down  all the pet theories in
       physics.  So perhaps I am in the  process  of  "TURNING  THE GRAVITY
       UPSIDE DOWN".  I'm also an INPERT.  Time will tell.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       We are now venturing into OUTER SPACE, so let us look at the results
       between Wright and the so called "EXPERTS".

         #1 - National Geographic - June, 1975, page 868:

              Mercury possesses something else quite unexpected..a magnetic
              field, though only one percent of earth's.

              The 'formula' I wrote prior to this space probe  said Mercury
              had a  magnetic  field that was one percent of earth's.  This
              is covered in Chapter 10 of my book.  I wasn't surprised.

         #2 - From a book called "JUPITER  THE LARGEST PLANET" by Asimov on
              page 198:

              "The moon lacks a magnetic field".  Here is  a  small portion
              of a  letter sent to me by a professor from the University of
              Alaska dated January 12th,  1977:  "Until the lunar landings,
              the moon was thought NOT to have a magnetic field."


                                      Page 4





              Prior to  the  lunar  landing  I said the moon HAD a magnetic
              field.  This  is covered  in  Chapter  1  of  my  book.   The
              professor ended  up  his letter saying the electronic  expert
              (that is  me)  has no business in basic science and my theory
              was "FULL OF HOLES".  Did  you  know  that the Nobel Prize in
              PHYSICS for 1978 was given to two Americans  who proved their
              outer space point by use of the ELECTRON THEORY?

         #3 - Channel 9 (KQED), San Francisco - March 5, 1979:

              Scientists were surprised to find out from Voyager 1 that the
              magnetic field   around  Jupiter  is  SO  ENORMOUS  and  this
              magnetic field EXTENDS WAY OUT FROM JUPITER.

              My magnetic forumla (same as  #1)  told me Jupiter's magnetic
              field WAS MUCH, MUCH STRONGER than Earth's.   Once  again the
              SO-CALLED EXPERTS were SURPRISED but I WASN'T.

         #4 -  The  experts  were surprised to find Venus and Mars are made
              from different "stuff" than earth.  I wasn't and I cover this
              subject in Chapter 5 in my book.

         #5 - The following is from "THIS WORLD" - March 11, 1979, page 29:

              "Einstein devoted  considerable   energy   to   showing  that
              probability was not the answer to HOW matter was constructed.
              Time has shown him in the main to have BEEN  WRONG.   He also
              made a  great  attempt in later life to construct his unified
              field theory  that  would unite  ELECTRO-MAGNETISM,  GRAVITY,
              SPACE and  TIME  under  one  set  of  equations.   He  wasn't
              successful."

              I have copyrighted two of these equations I feel Einstein was
              looking for  but  failed  to write.  One is a formula for the
              SPEED of our planets in their  orbits  AROUND  our  sun.  The
              other formula is for the DISTANCE that our planets  are  FROM
              THE SUN.

       There are many   other   subjects   about  which  the  experts  were
       surprised, bewildered, amazed, etc...  BUT I WASN'T...
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       In the UPI article Professor Commins  said  PUSH-GRAVITY  is totally
       false.  On July  17,  1979,  I  wrote  to  Professor   Commins   and
       challenged him to  bring  his  "PULL models" and PROVE ME WRONG at a
       showing I would be putting on at the Fairfield Moose Lodge on August
       6, 1979.  At this showing I gave evidence  with my models to support
       my theory that  our  tides  are caused by a "magnetic  push  factor"
       between our earth  and  our sun.  Professor Commins FAILED TO ACCEPT
       my challenge.  The  Fairfield   Moose   Lodge   sent   me   a   very
       complimentary letter dated August 17, 1979 expressing  BELIEF  IN MY
       THEORY.

       My plans for  the  future  are  to  contact  many  of the nationally
       televised programs such  as  the   Phil  Donahue  Show,  Tom  Snyder
       program, etc...and hopefully  will  get a guest shot.   Once  again,
       time will tell.

           (This was  written  over  10  years ago and STILL Walter has not
            been invited for national exposure  nor  have his theories made
            the national spotlight IN ANY FORM.

            Hopefully someone  reading  this and other papers  relating  to
            Wright's research  and  theories  will  arrange  to get him the
            national coverage and recognition which his theories merit.

            Walter is now 73 years of age and in excellent health, it would
            be a crowning achievement to  his  life  work that his theories
            get public and scientific recognition during his lifetime.

            He has spent thousands of dollars of his own money  researching
            and promoting his PUSH gravity work.  Every public challenge he
            has issued  has been ignored by established scientists educated
            in the retarded concept of Newtonian  Physics.  For those of us
            who recognize a pioneer in the field, Walter is  one who is far
            ahead of   the  pack  of  formally  educated  scientists.   The
            ramifications of  his work to  free  energy,  anti-gravity  and
            space travel are astounding.

            Note that there ARE NO MODELS TO DEMONSTRATE PULL  GRAVITY  yet
            Walter has dozens of WORKING MODELS TO DEMONSTRATE THE VALIDITY
            OF PUSH GRAVITY.)
