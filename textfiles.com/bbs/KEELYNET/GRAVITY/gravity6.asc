                              Roll Over, Isaac Newton
                                 by Kathy Jackson

             Brian Crabtree's theory involving wormholes and warps may
              not be valid, but he was ONLY 10 when he thought of it.

       Isaac Newton was 24 when an apple conked him on the head and got him
       thinking about gravity.  It took him  20 years to develop his theory
       and publish it.

       Brian Crabtree was 10 and eating dinner with his family when his own
       theory of gravity popped into his head.  It took him  three years to
       perfect the idea on his computer and present it to NASA.

       Steve Bales, assistant  director  of mission operations, asked Brian
       to come to NASA last month partly  out  of  courtesy  to  a  friend,
       Johanna Meyers-Boyles - Bryan's aunt.  Partly though, he invited the
       youngster out of curiosity.

       Brian packed his  computer  disc into a brown leather  briefcase  he
       borrowed from his  dad.   He  put  on  a  blue  tie.   He  boarded a
       Southwest Airlines flight - alone - and traveled to Houston.

       At NASA headquarters, Brian met with  Mr.  Bales  and  astronaut Bob
       Parker.  They bent  over  a computer, watching a bunch  of  brightly
       colored moving circles   and  spheres,  while  Brian  explained  his
       theory.  He used  words  like "wormholes,"  "dimples,"  "warps"  and
       "bubble universes."

       As to whether the theory has merit, well-Mr. Bales  and  Mr.  Parker
       didn't have a clue.

       "It took him  about two minutes to start talking over my head," says
       Mr. Bales.  "He's a very impressive young man.  The fact that he can
       talk about it at that age is extraordinarily remarkable."

       Mr. Parker says  he's  amazed by Brian's  complicated  calculations,
       whether or not they're plausible.

       "I don't know  if  it  raises  new  insights,  but   it  was  rather
       impressive, to say the least."

       Dr. Ivor Robinson,  an  astrophysicist at the University of Texas at
       Dallas, says he's impressed, too.   But  he  doesn't  think  Brian's
       theory is quite accurate.

                                      Page 1





       "I think perhaps   it's   unfair   to  a  10-year-old  to  take  his
       imagination too seriously," Dr. Robinson  says.   "It  sounds  as if
       this is a very bright and imaginative boy.  But he  needs  to  study
       what other people  have  done in this field...and perhaps he will be
       able to one day make a contribution."

       Astronomy writer Jeff Kanipe says  that  Brian's  theory sounds more
       plausible than some  of the others he's seen.  A former  writer  for
       ASTRONOMY magazine, Mr.  Kanipe  now is editor of STAR DATE magazine
       at the University of Texas at Austin.

       "I have certainly heard theories  that  are  less  sound,"  he says.
       "None of (Brian's theory) is proven, and most physicists, I imagine,
       would question his geography as far as the spherical attitude of the
       universe...But he sounds like someone with a lot of  vision.  And in
       physics and astronomy   today,  that's  what's  needed.   They  need
       visionaries who can put together good  theories  about what's really
       out there.  I would say he bears listening to."

       Brian was no ordinary toddler.  He was barely out of diapers when he
       started sounding out words and reading them.  His dad, Bob Crabtree,
       remembers holding Brian  while  standing in line at  a  Red  Lobster
       restaurant.

       "Hush puppies," Brian suddenly said.  He then read aloud each of the
       daily specials posted on the blackboard.

       "The woman in line behind us nearly passed out," Mr. Crabtree says.

       When Brian was  3  and  1/2,  Mr.  Crabtree  took  Brian to a Dallas
       psychologist to test his IQ.  One  of  the tasks she gave him was to
       draw a cherry  tree.   Most  children  create primitive,  stick-like
       drawings.  Brian drew  individual  leaves,  branches and stems.  The
       psychologist told Brian's parents  that  his  IQ was off the charts-
       somewhere beyond 200.

       Mr. Crabtree says  that Brian's intelligence - to  some  degree,  at
       least - might  be credited to his mother, Tamie, who died last month
       from a brain tumor.  When Brian  was  small,  she  worked  with  him
       constantly, teaching him  to  read and taking him to  museums.   She
       tried not to be pushy, Mr. Crabtree says, but to open Brian's mind.

       "If there was  an  interest  there,  she  tried  to develop it," Mr.
       Crabtree says.  "It got to where he  was  reading the books ahead of
       her.  We thought at first that he had memorized the  book;  then  we
       realized that he  was  reading.  It got to where he would read her a
       book to put her to sleep at night."

       In a hall of the Crabtree home hangs  a  portrait  of  Brian  as  an
       infant, cuddled in his mother's arms.  There's another  of  a family
       ski trip and  a  photo of Mrs. Crabtree, a former model, posing on a
       wooded path resplendent with fall  colors.   Above  the  computer in
       Brian's bedroom -  next  to  a  poster about helium  -  is  a  color
       Polaroid of his mother.

       He keeps her  picture  near him, but rarely talks about her.  He did
       say, though, that his mother was  proud  when  he told her about his
       NASA visit.

       "She thought it was really neat," he says.  "But she forgot about it
       five minutes later  because she wasn't able to remember anything for
       a very long time."

       Mr. Crabtree says that Brian seems  to have adjusted to his mother's
       death, probably because she prepared him for it.  In the three years
       between the diagnosis  of  the  brain  tumor  and  her  death,  Mrs.
       Crabtree talked to  Briand  and  his little sister, Angel, about her
       belief in a better life after death.

       Alice Hansen, who teaches Brian's  life science class at DeSoto East
       Junior High School, says he has done remarkably well  in the wake of
       his mother's death.  Only once has Brian shown the strain.

       "He took one  of  my  tests  and only made a 96 instead of 100," she
       says.  "I knew then that something was wrong."

       Brian's bedroom is  filled with rocket  models  and  photographs  of
       astronauts, including Walt Cunningham.  "To Brian,"  the inscription
       reads, "Study hard and grow up strong."

       There are shelves  of  books,  but not TOM SAWYER or THE HARDY BOYS.
       Instead, the shelves  are crammed  with  volumes  on  physics,  time
       travel and parallel universes.  Brian reads about  1,354  words  per
       minute - he  counted once.  The average person reads between 100 and
       200 words per minute.

       He goes to the library almost every  week,  usually bringing home 18
       books.  Near his computer are the volumes he has just  checked  out:
       MASTERING TURBO C  PHYSICS,  536  PUZZLES  AND  CURIOUS PROBLEMS and
       COMPUTER VIRUSES: A HIGH-TECH DISEASE.

       Brian already knows something about  computer  viruses.  He gave one
       to his best friend, Jeremy.  It was Brian's way of  getting  back at
       Jeremy for socking  him a few weeks ago.  Now when Jeremy signs onto
       his computer, he's greeted by the words, "Ha, ha."

       "It wasn't a major virus," Brian says, "It was just an annoying one.
       I know he can undo it."

       Brian doesn't watch  much  television.   His  hobbies  are  reading,
       working on his  computer, pestering his little sister  and  building
       models of rockets.

       "I'm going to try to get a rocket into the stratosphere with my name
       on it and see if someone will send it back to me," he says.

       Like most kids,  Brian  has  his failures and disappointments.  He's
       still upset with himself for only getting second place in the school
       science fair a couple of years ago.   His project involved splitting
       water molecules.

       He corresponds with a prisoner convicted of armed robbery, answering
       the man's request for a pen pal through one of the science magazines
       he's always reading.

       "He didn't do it, though," Brian says.  "He told me."

       Brian has a few close friends, but not many.  Maybe it's because

                                      Page 3





       other kids feel  uncomfortable with his braininess.  Maybe he's just
       something of a loner.

       "He has a real problem relating to  other  kids," says Mr. Crabtree.
       "He doesn't have  a lot of friends, but then neither  do  I.   Maybe
       he's just growing  up  like his dad.  He's not into football, soccer
       and the types of things that kids are interested in.

       "If he didn't  go to another movie  for  the  next  five  years,  it
       wouldn't be a problem.  I don't know if it's that he  doesn't  care,
       or if he just doesn't want you to know that it matters."

       Does Brian think other kids treat him differently?

       Brian pauses, chewing on a big wad of gum.

       "I don't know,"  he  says  matter-of-factly.  "Because I haven't had
       any experience at not being me."

       Vangard note....

           We are attempting to get in touch with this remarkable young man
           to see if he would be willing  to  write a paper on his theories
           and/or to place his computer graphics demonstrating his theories
           on KeelyNet and other boards of this nature.  Mr.  Bob Crabtree,
           Brian's father,  currently  has  an  unlisted  number but we are
           continuing to seek contact through the Dallas Morning News staff
           writer.

       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Here is Brian's theory in his own words:

          "There are two universes: one of matter          - the inner
                                    and one of anti-matter - the outer."

          "Both have a spherical fashion  (shape)  when  observed  in  four
           dimensions.  They are curved into spheres in such a way that the
           fourth dimension, time, is in every direction radiating FROM the
           center.

           The three linear dimensions are centered in the  skin  of  these
           'bubble universes.'"

          "When a  mass  exists  in  one  universe,  it is attracted to the
           other, forming a 'dimple' or 'bump' that other masses can 'roll'
           into.

          "In this way, time progresses  as  the  universe oscillates.  The
           universes are  in  a field of all space and time  known  as  the
           OMNIUNIVERSE (OMNIVERSE).

           There are  other  bi-universes  within  this  field connected by
           wormholes - tiny, subatomic tunnels  of  space  and time.  Since
           they must  only  be spherical in fashion, not shape;  wormholes,
           rifts, warps and bridges can exist.

          "This theory  accounts  for  gravity, slow time, shrunk space and
           the cosmic background radiation."

       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Vangard Note...

           The theory  presents  many  interesting possibilities and we are
           correlating with some of the information  on KeelyNet as well as
           some of the info we have yet to place on the board.

           One of these is the intriguing research done at  the turn of the
           century by the USA and French geodetic survey experiments.  This
           led directly  to the Eotvos experiment and the hypothesis of the
           Fifth Force - Repulsion.

           The Koreshan Society is the  current  group  keeping  this  work
           alive and  a  file  is on KeelyNet relating to the  observations
           which bring  up  some most bizarre discrepancies about the Earth
           and just where the hell we are.

           Ron and I found an article which  will  soon  be  listed  in its
           entirety detailing the experiments at the turn of the century.

           Essentially, they involved suspending 2 separate  weights down a
           single mine  shaft  with  the  idea  of  locating  the center of
           gravity of  the Earth.  On measuring  the  "attraction"  it  was
           found instead  that  the weights REPELLED.  The  experiment  was
           discounted in  the belief that either magnetic, electrostatic or
           wind currents might have caused the discrepancy.

           Each possibility was removed and  the test re-performed with the
           same REPELLING effect.

           The test  was  performed again in another location  where  there
           were 2  mine shafts spaced a considerable distance apart.  AGAIN
           the REPELLING effect showed up.  No matter where or who does it,
           this effect is in evidence.

           Triangulation showed the center of gravity of the earth to exist
           approximately 4000 miles out in  space.  The above test has been
           performed in other locations on the planet and  ALWAYS  WITH THE
           4000 mile center of gravity present.

           The indications are startling!  Is there a shell 4000 miles from
           the earth's  surface  which attracts OR BLOWS some force similar
           to if not actually being gravity???

           Stay tuned for the entire file.
