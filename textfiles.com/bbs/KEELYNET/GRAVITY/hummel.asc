Though I had intended to get this online much sooner, serendipity has worked
greatly in our favor by the delay.  Mr. Stewart Harris' TOMI principle, Stefan
Hartman's idea of shaping the field by use of angle irons on the end as well
as the open contributions of others who have made the effort to duplicate Mr.
Harris's fascinating discovery lend that much more credence to how such a
device as described in this document can be 'self-driven'. (see TMIDEVIC,
TOMIBILD, TOMIMOTR, TOMIFLAT on KeelyNet for background information)

The following information results from a series of private discussions with
certain individuals at a recent conference.  In order to respect their privacy
and confidentiality, no names will be mentioned.  The information is so
intriguing that I think it should not be witheld from those who research in
the areas of anti-gravity or electrical flight...>>> Jerry/Sysop/KeelyNet

The Hummel Levity Disk

While at a recent conference, I had the pleasure of meeting John Searl and
John Thomas.  For those who study such matters, you are no doubt aware that
John Thomas has written a series of books recording details of the Law of the
Squares and the Searl Levity Disk.  These books are fascinating, and I
PARTICULARY RECOMMEND the first in the series, Anti-Gravity, which sells for
$25.00.  For an excellent overview of the Searl claims, please download the
file SEARLE3.ZIP from KeelyNet, it is an astounding piece of work excerpted
from the book, "Anti-Gravity, the Dream made Reality", which John Thomas
kindly allowed us to put online.

The remainder of the books cover what Searl calls the Law of the Squares which
Searl claims are necessary to produce anti-grav and free energy (and we
suspect other effects) if properly applied.  I am providing the address if
you'd like to order the book or the entire set.

During a conference, the greatest pleasure and sources of information usually
arise from private or 'after-hours' discussions.  During one of these, a
friend and I were discussing Searl and some of the intriguing phenomena
associated with his claims.  This friend asked if I'd ever heard of a fellow
named HUMMEL.

I said no and he hesitated, then told me about this fellow up in Canada who
had come up with his own 'poor man's' Searl disk using magnets that were
essentially off-the-shelf.  This fellow would provide me with no details as to
the construction of the device but did relate an interesting story regarding
some of the original experiments with the Hummel design.

He said that the magnets were attached to radial spokes or arms that were
jointed.  These magnets floated in a magnetic housing which gave it the least
resistance to air or friction.  When the inventor built one of his early
models, he was working in a backroom of his house.  He got the machine
finished about 2AM and gave it a slight spin to make sure it would spin
freely.

Being very tired, he went off to bed.  A couple of hours later, he heard this
tremendous crashing sound.  Running to the workroom, he noticed his device was
missing and there were pieces of plaster and rubble on the floor of the room.
Looking up, he noticed a hole in the ceiling.

The floating magnets, when properly biased, continued to spin, gaining
momentum and speed with each rotation.  Once it reaches a critical velocity,
the disk achieves the same electrical field compression that Searl reports in
his many reports of 'lost' disks and ends up taking off.  Both the Hummel and
Searl disks achieve the same tremendous electrostatic buildup on the outside
rim.

My friend would provide no further details on how this device was constructed,
so I was left pondering what he said.  In a later conversation with another
fellow, we swapped some information and I asked if he'd ever heard of this
mysterious Hummel Disk.  He said sure, would you like to see how it works?  Of
course, I jumped at the opportunity.

A rough diagram of the layout of the magnets which form the machine was drawn
and it's operation explained to some degree. I've finally gotten it drawn up
as HUMMEL.GIF if you'd like to study it.

The principle is not only elegant but very efficient as to cost.  Where Searl
requires these special custom made magnets costing upwards of $10,000 EACH,
the Hummel Levity Disk uses basically off the shelf magnets arranged in a
certain fashion, as depicted in HUMMEL.GIF.  Searl's magnets are composed of
neodymium and other elements, specially arranged and constructed.

As you read the following, please refer to the diagram HUMMEL.GIF for a better
understanding.  I still have some questions about how this thing works because
not everything was explained to me.  Hopefully as others study it, they will
share their observations and we can all work collectively to figure it out and
allow duplication.

Imagine a hollow drum or cylinder, with magnets attached to the interior side
walls and bottom.  There are 3 discs composed of a series of magnets mounted
on flexible sliding arms in a radial configuration.  These are arranged in
such a way that the disc floats on a cushion of magnetic repelling fields.

The 3 disk assemblies are radial arms consisting of 3 magnets, one of which is
attached on the inside arm tip, one on the middle of the arm and one on the
outside of the arm.  The middle of this arm has a flexible coupling which as
far as I understand it can be compressed like a sleeve.  The coupling allows
the arm to bend at the middle, yet stays rigid in the horizontal axis to
prevent the flipping of the magnets, this is necessary to sustain a repulsion.

Thus, looking at it from the top down, you would see something looking like a
bicycle wheel disk, having a series of radial spokes, connected to a central
hub.  There are 3 of these bicycle type disks, all balanced and floating
in the air because of magnetic repulsion and contained within the confines of
this drum.

(I can't say for certain that the disks were mounted on a central shaft
because the disks needed the absolute least friction from any mechanical
coupling.  The blinding velocities were achieved AS A RESULT of no friction.
Nowadays, using a Meissner field to provide that magnetic repelling chamber
would be a great improvement and probably be easier to reproduce, however I
understand this device was built using off-the-shelf magnets!!)

In the center of this apparatus and at the top, are two LARGE, high flux
density magnets, separated by a screw thread (A & B as the Control unit in the
drawing).  When the top magnet is screwed down, it's repulsion field causes
the lower magnet to push down and tilt sideways.  This sideways repulsion then
creates a repelling field that causes each of the floating arms to push down
and around.  Thus causing rotation and the disks spin.

As far as I can tell, the flexible coupling on each magnet arm allows the
'burp' from the repulsion field against the top magnets, that would normally
prevent free rotation, to move out of the way enough to allow the disk to get
past this point, then it helps to repel on the opposite side when the arm
moves back to its position.  It is possible that the separation of the arms
(equivalent to phase) would assist this motion.  (this was written BEFORE
Stewart Harris and his TOMI principle!)

Once you start it, the rotation is slow but eventually builds up to tremendous
speed because of the low-friction from the magnetic suspension.  I would
imagine the device would be quite dangerous at the high rotational velocities
and so the magnets should be as securely fastened and balanced as possible.

I showed this diagram to John Searl and he just raised his eyebrows, but said
nothing about it.  John Thomas said he was aware of this device but had no
evidence of it beyond a description sent to him.

I was also told that the disk acts EXACTLY the same as Searls', that is, as
the velocity increases, it reaches a point where a tremendous electrical field
is generated and only then does it take off and lose itself in the atmosphere.

The apparatus was mounted in an aluminum shell similar to a flying saucer
shape to allow accumulation of the electrical energy on the outside surface.

When it was started from a takeoff position close to the earth, it would
attempt to lift off the ground.  Instead, lightning bolts would jump from the
ship, grounding the craft to the earth due to the sapping of energy.  Each
time this happens, the energy would have to re-accumulate.  Eventually, they
learned how to overcome this to provide a sustained ascension.

Hummel found that by using an insulated takeoff platform approximately 6 feet
from the ground, he could completely prevent these lightning discharges from
happening and got to a point where ascension and descension could be
controlled in increments of one inch (so I was told).

To prevent the craft from becoming lost, the control magnets that were
attached to the screw thread to cause the downward repulsion, tilt and
subsequent rotation, were controlled by an attached barometer.  When the craft
reached a certain reduced air pressure, it was expected to be too high up and
possibly still rising.

In order to prevent the craft from becoming lost in space as did so many of
Searls, the reduced barometric pressure would cause the screw to spin up,
thereby reducing the control magnet repulsion force, thus slowing down the
spin and allowing the ship to come in for a controlled landing.  This at least
kept the ship from becoming lost and I assume they were visually tracked to
allow retrieval.  (So if you find one of these things, send it to us here at
KeelyNet so we can study it!).

Searl says he could never figure out how to control his craft and prevent them
from taking off like this, until one day at a demonstration, he noticed the
SPIN of the craft SLOWED DOWN when a video camera was aimed at the ship.  It
turned out that a scanning frequency emitted by the camera somehow interferred
with the rotation or energy accumulation, possibly from resonant coupling with
the material in Searls' compound magnets to cause them to reduce their spin
velocity.  After this fortunate observation, Searl says he could now control
the spin velocity with a remote control circuit.

There are several intriguing phenomena associated with Searl's disks, one of
which is a vacuum that develops in the center of the spinning disk.  There is
also what appears to be an inertia-free field which also occurs in this
central section.

Searl's SEG (Space Energy Generator) uses this same principle except that it
is used as a generator.  The machine is prevented from reaching the critical
velocity that produces lift by use of a 'governor', either mechanical or
electronic, I have never seen details on how it was done.  If rotating a metal
mass causes electrons to be thrown to an outside receptive accumulator rim (as
Searl claims), then those very high density electrostatic energies could be
tapped directly (like a Wimshurst such as used in the Testatika and HYDE
machines) OR the spin could be used to drive another generator.

We will have more details on such devices and technologies as they are
collected and typed up for distribution and study.  Such information should
not be held secret unless there are business or proprietary reasons.  As far
as I am aware, such is not the case with the Hummel device.

After getting the details of this device, I again met the fellow who first
mentioned this and showed him the diagram.  He became very agitated and wanted
to know WHO had showed me this and what I intended to do with it.  He was not
informed of my source but of course, it needed to be put online for those who
study such matters.  Almost like someone was sworn to secrecy or something.
No further information was provided at that time nor has anything specifically
about Hummel been learned since, although I have spoken with many people about
it and no one has admitted to knowing anything about the man or the device.

The entire project is kept extremely secret and only by invitation is anyone
allowed to see a live demonstration or become aware of the technology.  Hummel
is supposed to live in Canada where he carries out his experiments in relative
privacy.

Those who study UFOs will note the claims of some kind of experimental base in
Canada, believed to be related to French absorption and continued research
into the Nazi Kugelblitz technology from World War 2.

If Hummel is the actual source of these mystery sightings, we might be all
that much closer to nailing down some of these spook technologies to practical
experiments as this file and most KeelyNet files are intended to promote.

Well, this is an important piece of information that everyone who studies
alternative flight or power principles needs to know about.  I am sure there
are more details out there that we hope will also be openly shared once this
gets distributed to our various Associates.

I have since learned there is a video and/or computer program that shows how
this machine is constructed and operates, I know the person who has the
computer animation, but he won't talk and was upset that any of this was about
to 'hit the pavement'.  There are still private demonstrations of this machine
that are periodically held in Canada to attract financial backers and support.

I will persist in trying to get the animation and any other details on the
Hummel Disc if at all possible.  If you try building this device or any
modification of it, we would appreciate the sharing of your experiences with
all of us here at KeelyNet.

The fact that the machine can not only be used to produce electrical flight
but also as an energy generator system makes it important that everyone study,
correlate and experiment with these principles.  We should do whatever we can
to make this a reality.

As you will see by studying the TOMI information, a positive thrust CAN be
produced which could easily explain the self propelling attributes of the
Hummel and Searl machines.  Just keep in mind that the extremely high
velocities needed to funnel the electrons to the outside rim, will require a
balanced arm assembly for safety.

There has been other information gathered, one in particular from a Russian
source which is being compiled into a file that might help in research in this
area.  It indicates experiments showing the earth as being POSITIVE instead of
negative in polarity, which, if true, will change much of our understanding of
how terrestrial and atmospheric electrical energy operates.

Be careful, think before you build, ask for advice from others, collect
whatever other information might be helpful and share your findings.
