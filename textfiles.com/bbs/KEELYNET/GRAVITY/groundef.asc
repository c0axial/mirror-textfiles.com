                            A New Concept in Flight

From World Harmony News - Australia and New Zealand March 1994, as reported in
the Space Energy Journal, vol 5, no 3, sept 1994, p 19.

Imagine yourself crusing at 200 kms/hour over land or water in a three meter
diameter craft being safely guided by the NAV satellite navigation system to a
destination of your choice - anywhere on the planet.  You are only using one
ninth the amount of fuel of any known aircraft, with five people on board and
a large payload totaling three tons in weight, and it only cost you the price
of a family car to buy.

What would be your response?  Perhaps one of suspicion, disbelief or fantasy,
right?  Be careful with your disbelief.  Reportedly, this technology exists
and has been brought to us through a series of amazing events that led us to
its inventor - Dr. Brian Collins who just happens to live in Perth, the
current home base of World Harmony.

Brian established his creditability through one of his inventions - the
Collins Motor, a culmination of two decades of research, most of which has
been done overseas.  The Collins Motor Corporation has as its major
shareholder TNT (A "blue chip" public company).  Relinquishing control of this
company enabled Brian to free himself for even more exciting areas.

One of his endeavors has lead him to what he is currently embarking on - what
he described in a recorded meeting with World Harmony on the 10 January this
year, as "a new concept in flight".  During a visit to his research
establishment in the UK in December, Brian was contacted by a team of Russian
scientists - the team who put Major Uri Gagarin, the first man into space in
the early 1960's.

The team had been researching what is generally known as the "ground effect" -
a phenomenon that enables an albatross to fly across water for days without
flapping its wings to do so.  They discovered what Brian calls "a new
principle of non-linear physics".  THE PHENOMENON GIVES 30 UNITS OF LIFT FOR
EVERY UNIT OF DOWN THRUST AND MODELS HAVE BEEN BUILT THAT HAVE PROVEN THE
PHENOMENON.

Production prototypes are the next phase of development and this is where
Brian and his team come in.  An agreement has been made that production should
start in Australia rather than in Russia because of the turmoil there.

The plan is to build a number of craft in the Perth area within the next
twelve months.  The craft described above will be the first, with four others
currently on the drawing board, to follow.  The largest will be 60 meters in
diameter and will carry up to 1500 tons, fly at 600-750 kms/hour and only cost
a fraction of conventional aircraft.  This payload is five times that of a
Jumbo Jet and uses only one ninth the fuel, one ninth the power and less than
one twentieth the pollution because of the use of another invention of Brian's
- the "Microniser".

Brian explained excitedly how his new company had recently signed a multi-
million dollar contract to supply Athens, Greece, with fuel "Micronisers".
The microniser reduces fuel consumption by 20%, unburnt hydrocarbons by some
60% and increases power by some 10%.  Tests were carried out on a FIAT 128.
The Microniser is a 20-minute retrofit device.  They are to be manufactured in
NWS (New South Wales) and air-freighted to Athens on a monthly basis.  The
money from this venture will give Brian and his dedicated group a guaranteed
cash flow to enable them to carry on with their work.
