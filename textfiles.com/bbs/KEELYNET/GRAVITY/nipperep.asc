                              NEW GRAVITATION THEORY
                                      ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

                        Professor Tells of Electrical Tests
                        Turning Attraction Into Repulsion.

       ST. LOUIS, Sept.  18.Ä  A  new  theory  as  to  gravitation  will be
       announced soon before the St. Louis Academy of Sciences by Professor
       Francis E. Nipper, retired head  of  the  Department  of  Physics of
       Washington University.

           "It will be shown that gravitational attraction  between  masses
            of matter  not only has been diminished into zero, but has been
            converted into repulsion which is more than twice as great as
            normal attraction."

       Professor Nipper made   his  experiments   with   bodies   suspended
       horizontally toward each other. By introducing electricity  into the
       atmosphere he converted normal attraction into repulsion.

           "If electricity  can  alter  the gravitational attraction of the
            bodies used in my experiments,"  he  said,  "the same force can
            alter the earth's attraction.

            If the  negative  electricity could be drawn from  the  earth's
            surface, gravitational  attraction suddenly would cease and the
            cohesion of   the  earth's  surface   would   be   disastrously
            affected."
