                     Scientist says Invention can Defy Gravity

       London (AP)

       A British scientist  said  yesterday  he  is  on  the  threshold  of
       inventing an antigravity motor that  could fly a manned spaceship to
       the stars using nuclear fuel the size of a pea.

       Eric Laithwaite, professor  of  heavy  electrical   engineering   at
       London's Imperial College  of Science and Technology, said the motor
       is based on  the  gyroscope,  a rapidly  spinning  top  that  defies
       gravity.  Gyroscopes already are used to guide spaceships.

       "The motor is  not  easy to explain.  If it was, others  would  have
       tried to produce one by now," said Laithwaite, who described himself
       as an astro engineer.

       Laithwaite began working  on  the  motor  about six months ago after
       Edwin Rickman, who works with an electrical  engineering  firm, came
       to him with the idea.  Rickman had patented it after he said it came
       to him in recurring dreams.  Laithwaite incorporated  in  the device
       ideas of another amateur inventor, Alex Jones.

       Although Laithwaite is  far from the production stage with his motor
       to defy gravity,  the  53-year  old   professor   demonstrated   his
       principle Friday at the Royal Institution at London.

       Inside a box he brought before his distinguished audience  were  two
       electrically driven gyroscopes,  each  placed  on  a  central pivot.
       Laithwaite made the gyroscopes rotate  at  high speed, and they rose
       into the air  on  the  arms  until they reached a curved  rail  that
       pushed them down again.  The process then repeated itself.

       With the two  gyroscopes motionless, the box weighed 20 pounds on an
       ordinary kitchen scale.    With   the   gyroscopes   spinning,   the
       contraption weighed 15 pounds.

       Laithwaite said the loss of weight corresponded to  the gravity loss
       produced by the  spinning  gyroscopes.   Theoretically,  the machine
       could produce weightlessness, Laithwaite said.

       A spaceship with  his  device  could  be  blasted  from  the earth's
       gravitational field with conventional rocket fuel, Laithewaite said.
       Then, without friction to hamper  the  anti-gravity  engine, nuclear
       power or solar  energy could begin operating the gyroscopes  and  to
       drive the vehicle to other solar systems, he said.

       Laithwaite is the inventor of the electrical linear motor capable of
       propelling a device through strong magnetic currents.

       He said the  antigravity  motor also could be adapted to drive ships
       and land vehicles silently but added:  "Man  is  not  interested  in
       traveling horizontally.  He always wants to go up."

       Laithwaite said  the  antigravity motor is based on electromagnetism
       and vector multiplication "too complicated to explain."

       Then he tried:

          "Let me put it this way:

               You take  a  go-kart  with  no  engine and sit in it.  It is
               loaded with a box of lead  balls.  If you throw one ball out
               behind you,  you move forward a little.  Throw  another  and
               you move farther still and so on.

               But if  these  lead  balls were attached to a strong elastic
               band and could be sprung  back  into  the go-kart, you would
               have continuous propulsion.  That is what a  gyroscope  does
               when it moves from one plane to another."
