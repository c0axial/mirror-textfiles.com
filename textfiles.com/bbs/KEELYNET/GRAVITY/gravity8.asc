               This is a letter to the Editor as it appeared in the
               now defunct FLYING SAUCERS magazine on December 1964
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Dear Ray Palmer;

            On May 28, 1964, after some 32 years of scientific research, as
       an amateur, I  gave  my first lecture entitled, "A New Gravitational
       Theory", part of which concerned the  Moon.  Therefore, I would like
       to comment on the article "Life on the Moon?" by  Rev.  Guy  J. Cyr,
       S.M., in the August 1964, FLYING SAUCERS.

            He has  reported  from  many sources as to what selenographers,
       astronomers, and space  scientists  have  reported,  but  no  actual
       quotes are used, except for a few words.  And as reported,  some  of
       these people contradict  one  another,  and  some  agree  on certain
       points about possible clues to life on the Moon.

            However, according to my gravitational  theory, the Moon floats
       in space like a ship on water, or a balloon with ballast.   The Moon
       floats in space  at  only  about  2,000  miles  per hour; because it
       requires about 18,000 miles per hour  for a rocket to stay in orbit,
       in a projectory, always falling beyond the horizon.  It would take a
       higher speed or velocity to attain a higher orbit.

            According to  my  theory,  "the  Earth is but  a  small  object
       floating IN THE  CENTER of a space fluid or gas, that has a specific
       gravity displacement within a centrifugal  rotating - gas - pressure
       - expansion -  of its atoms, contained within the heavier  molecular
       atmosphere of the Sun".

            Thus each  space  layer  farther  out,  gets  HEAVIER  and MORE
       COMPRESSED per unit of space; and  its  atoms ROTATE SLOWER, because
       they are smaller and have less gas pressure.  So that  the molecular
       atmosphere with its  larger  atoms  which  have  greater centrifugal
       force or rotation, are forced into  a  molecular  atmosphere  layer,
       having a REVERSED  GRAVITATION, near the Earth's surface  caused  by
       the atomic -  gas  -  pressure.   It would be impossible to give the
       complete theory in this letter.  Suffice  it to say, that the highly
       compressed VOID IN  THE  CENTER OF THE MOON is CENTRIFUGALLY  THROWN
       AWAY from the Earth's center.

            While the  rotating  molecules  of  the  Moon's crust are being
       forced toward the Earth's surface.  It is also my theory that Cosmic
       Ray atomic particles CAUSES THOSE  ATOMS  TO  ROTATE, penetrating as
       far as they can into our mixed - atomic/molecular surface  crust  of
       the Earth or Moon.  Which also causes Solar heat, and a molten layer
       beneath the crust.

            Now then,  the  Moon is round, caused by a gas pressure when it
       once did rotate  and  had an atmosphere.   The  Moon  does  not  now
       rotate; it floats  in the Earth's space fluid or  gas.   It  has  no
       molecular atmosphere, BECAUSE  it  does not rotate.  The Moon has no
       gravity of its own for the same reason.  Gravity is a PRESSURE-PUSH,
       not a field ATTRACTION, because gravity CANNOT BE SCREENED.

            Therefore, any dust on the visible  part  of the Moon will have
       already fallen to the Earth.  And nobody will ever  be  able to land
       on any part  of  the  Moon that we can see.  If they try and land on
       the opposite side, they will have to hang on for dear life. Besides,
       I predict that there is a big chunk  missing  from the opposite side
       of the Moon  that  has  unbalanced its orginal gyroscopic  rotation,
       causing it to be like a Roly-Poly.

       Vamgard notes...

            Obviously this  article has some mistakes (if we really believe
            that we landed on the moon.   There  are many who say the whole
            thing was staged and numerous "proofs" are given  to verify the
            point.)  If  that is so, perhaps Mr. Johnson still has a chance
            for the verification of his theories.  The PUSH GRAVITY concept
            is so  inline  with  many modern  observations  that  it  bears
            intense study.

            Aether drifts and is attached to the earth.  For those studying
            or trying  to  verify  the  Aether,  this causes  a  myriad  of
            mistaken measurements  due  to  this  cloying effect.  This guy
            says that we are at the center  of  a LESS DENSE MEDIUM kept in
            its place by denser and denser layers as the distance  from the
            Earth INCREASES.

            As a  result,  anytime we try to INCREASE THE DENSITY OF A MASS
            by infusing more energy into a small space, the density of that
            energy would cause the mass to  want to "gravitate" or levitate
            to its own level.  In this case, there are many  levels  as  we
            move into space, yet ANY OF THESE LEVELS would be sufficient to
            "assist" an  energized  mass to lift off the Earth and seek its
            energetic level.

            We can clearly see that the analogy  of  a series of "barriers"
            to contain pressures of successively higher intensities  as one
            moves into  space  AWAY  FROM  PLANETS AND CELESTIAL BODIES, is
            simply brilliant and astoundingly simple.
