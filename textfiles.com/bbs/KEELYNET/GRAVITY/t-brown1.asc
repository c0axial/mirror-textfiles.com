       From    : TERRY BASTIAN
       Subject : Biefield Brown propulsion explained????

       Method of producing thrust using high voltage capcitors.....

       Background...

       A reaction thrust  drive  works by using off center spinning weights
       to produce an  overall  motion  in  one  direction.(see  reaction  &
       inertial drives).  These systems are plagued by bearings,  friction,
       large size, and material fatigue.

       Theory..........

       To overcome these short commings, use the natural rotation of an
       electron in an atom....  By having 2 atoms with their electron spins
       in opposite directions  and  locked in a matrix will cause a fore an
       back motion overall and a negation of all side to side motion...

       If we distort the electrons orbit  to  increase  its distance on one
       side of the atom and decrease it on the other side,  we would create
       an unbalanced inertial force on the longer side...

       By increasing the distortion sufficicently we could produce an
       overall motion in  one direction.....(distortion factor). The atomic
       structure would vibrate at a mechanical  frequency  while under this
       motion........(GHZ and higher).   The electrons would  emit  photons
       while in its lowest orbit energy state......

       The force created would be increased by the nimber of electrons
       present in the operation and distortion placed on each one......

       The distortion required would need to be at least enough to
       overcome the mass  of  the  electrons  and  atomic  nucleus....  The
       effect probly will only work upon active distortion and cease
       upon stable distortion.......(charging  and  discharging VS constant
       charge)

       MACHINE.........


                                      Page 1





       The method to  distort  the  electron  orbits  is  a  2  plate  flat
       capacitor and apply a high voltage to those plates........(kilovolts
       to mega) The negativily charged plate would repulse the electron and
       the positive plate would attract it  distorting  the orbit about the
       atomic nucleus.........

       The substance (dielectric) between the plates would then, under
       the proper distortion,   have   a   force   towards   the   positive
       plate.......

       To produce an  efficent  force  the  electron orbits need to be in a
       50/50 rotation in opposite directions  so  as  to  work together and
       negate all other motion side to side.....

       One way is to manufacture or orient the spin axis  in  a  toroid  or
       doughnut shape so  to  make  the  axis  align  together but atoms on
       opposite sides of the torus are  of  the  opposite  orientation  and
       rotation thus the nullifying of side to side motions.....

       This could be  done  by  spin  casting the dielectric  or  using  an
       torroidal and axial  magnetic  fields  in  manufatcuring  and  or in
       actual distortion use..........

       The dielectric must be chosen to provide for adequate leakage to
       maintain an active  charge rate and  also  have  an  extremely  high
       dielectric constant factor and lastly have a high voltage  breakdown
       potential level.

       There are many other considerations to take in account for and other
       methods to apply like MHD technology and resonant frequency feeding
       and application of   diamagnetic/dielectric   materials   and   Hall
       effects.....

       This has been released to hopefully  show  that  these things are in
       our grasp to   understand   and   duplicate  and   that   THEY   ARE
       POSSIBLE!!!!!....

       Replies and criticism are welcome........15 JULY 1992

       This is the  sole  theory  of  Terrance A. Bastian.....discovered in
       1990.
