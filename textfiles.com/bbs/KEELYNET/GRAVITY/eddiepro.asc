                                      FORWARD

       After researching the electro-gravitational  methods of Thomas Brown
       and other notables,  we decided to go to work on the best way to get
       magnetic, gravetic, and harmonics to work for us.   The harmonics we
       believe to be  high  points of energy, by which we draw on the lines
       of magnetic force.  Once focussed  we  may receive N - S polar power
       along with the rotating earth.

       We believe gravity  waves  to  be harmonic.  We call  these  gravity
       waves U &  D  waves or moon gravity up and earth gravity down.  This
       can be visualized as existing between any two celestial bodies.

       The principle can  be  used  to  produce  intergalactic  spacecraft.
       However, it requires flinging away at precise angles  from  the host
       bodies.  This idea can be expanded on.

       By using other  celestial bodies at the proper glance angle, one can
       increase or decrease  the  craft speed.  We  believe  the  following
       outline will be a good starting point for indepth and  more detailed
       research to come.

       Magnetic lines of  force  from  the earths' poles are induced into a
       disc of non-ferrous material or upon the space ship at the same time
       gravity waves from the earth and moon are induced into the disc.

       These lines of force being out of  phase create an eddy current into
       the disc.  This  action  will  cause  the disc to rotate.   Lift  is
       produced by the cross action of the variable magnetic lines of force
       and the nearly constant gravitic waves.

       Counter-clockwise rotations have  been known in gyroscopes to reduce
       weight.  Clockwise increases weight.  A magnification of the gravity
       and magnetic forces is required.  In order to make this process work
       an elaborate method must be interfaced.

       A specialized transceiver must be  able  to  tune  into the harmonic
       beat frequencies of both the earth and moon simultaneously  in order
       to draw on their energy fields, in this case gravity and reintroduce
       them, magnified vertically  across  the  disc.   The electromagnetic
       force of the earths' geomagnetic field  must also be allowed to flow
       horizontally.

       If the two are out of phase at a 70ø angle the system will work with
       nature as its  power source.  Once the forces are allied  (aligned?)
       correctly the disc itself will act as a self excited motor.  Just as
       there are Horizontal  and  Vertical Radio waves so are the forces of
       nature also set-up.

       Building the transceiver  should   be  rather  simple.   However,  a
       synchronization technique such as a field strength  detection system
       should be employed.   This is why Flying saucers often fly at angles
       rather then in straight paths.

       Just as you align a receiving antenna  so  does  the  Flying  Saucer
       align itself for optimum preference among the field forces.

       Electrogravitation is now  in  action,  not unlike Townsend  Brown's
       flying disc's.  However,  this system uses a DC current acting at an
       AC rate. Producing  the Eddy Current  Propulsion  system.   Townsend
       Brown used a power source at all times and it consisted of pure DC.

       This unit utilizes  natural  forces. However, during  the  start  up
       sequence or in  case  of  an emergency, an electric or nuclear power
       cell and gravitic   cellular  cell   based   on   Townsend   Brown's
       Gravitators should be added to compensate for energy  swings  in the
       geomagnetic field or  anomalies  in  the  gravity fields utilized by
       this otherwise self sustaining free energy system.
