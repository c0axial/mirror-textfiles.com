                                 Gravity Machine?

       The following summary was sent from  a  Ship's  Paper of October 30,
       1957, after being copied from a CW News broadcast while  at sea.  It
       is unusual because  no other report of this announcement reached us.
       It certainly is sensational - if true.

       Baltimore, Md., October 29 - A group  of  inventors  claimed  Monday
       they have been able to utilize gravity in circular  motion  machines
       capable of powering everything from hearing aids to space cruisers.

       Otis T. Carr,  president  of  OTC  Enterprises,  Inc.,  detailed his
       claims in an interview and demonstration  of  a  crude  model  of  a
       circular motion machine which he said is the principle  of  a  "free
       energy circular foil"  space  craft he can build, if someone puts up
       the money.

       He said the machine can be adapted to devices of any size to produce
       continuous power absolutely free of dissipation.

       Its immediate application, Carr said,  would  be  in a space craft -
       which would be  able to fly among the planets in controlled  flight.
       It could land  or  take off as desired on the earth, the moon or any
       planet in the earth's solar system, he said.

       Carr and his associates said their  claims  are  based  on  the most
       simple practical applications  of  natural laws and  discoveries  in
       science and mathematics.   They  have no formal education in science
       or engineering.

       He said the same "free energy" which  causes  the earth to rotate on
       its axis and orbit around the sun will turn a machine  he  described
       as two cones joined at their circular bases.

       When the rotation  of  such  a  machine  reaches  a certain velocity
       relative to the earth's orbital velocity,  Carr  said,  it will take
       off.

       Carr said the core of his space ship would be a huge  battery  which
       would spin at  the velocity of the external craft and which would be
       recharged, he said, by its motion.   Carr  declared  such a battery,
       built to any size, could be designed to power the largest electric

       generating plant, operate  an  automobile, heat a house or power any
       conceivable machine or device.

       The principle on which Carr said such circular motion machines would
       operate is that  "any  vehicle"  accelerated  to  an  axis  rotation
       relative to its  attractive  inertial  mass (the earth)  immediately
       becomes activated by  free  space  energy and acts as an independent
       force.
