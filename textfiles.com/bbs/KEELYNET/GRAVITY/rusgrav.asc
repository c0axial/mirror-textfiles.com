  In studying the  work  of  Walter  Russell,  it  becomes  apparent that the
  classic distinctions between  energy  and  matter  are  in  perception,  as
  opposed to construction.  In his experiments at Westinghouse,  Russell  was
  able to change  the  atomic  content  of  matter through the application of
  magnetic energy at the angle which was  complementary  to  his chart of the
  elements.

  In other words,  distilled  water  could become predominately  hydrogen  or
  fluorine, when exposed to magnetic energies which were at the frequency
  and phase of those elements.  This proved Russell's contentions that:

     1.  Atoms are naturally resonant, in nine octaves which start and end
         with the noble gases.

     2.  Transmutation does not exist.  All elements are in transition to
         the only stable state in nature, which is carbon.

     3.  Natural   vortical   flows  of  magnetism  provide  the  heat  which
         ultimately makes life possible.

  Russell pictorially represented  the   vortical   flows  in  his  "Wave  of
  Creation", which was reviewed and understood by Nikola Tesla.  It was upon
  seeing this, that Tesla advised Russell to lock up his discoveries for 1000
  years, until mankind was "ready" for it.

  Russell went on to create a working model of the "wave",  which  tapped ZPE
  and provided energy  well  above  unity.   Having done this, Russell sent a
  letter to the President of the United  States,  to  advise  him  that a new
  power source, safer than nuclear energy, had been found.   That, of course,
  was forty years ago.

  It appears that Russell, who at one time had been struck by lightning, and
  who was thought to be mentally unstable by some of his family members, may
  have discovered the G.U.T., or Grand Unifying Theory.  It is difficult to
  imagine of a  G.U.T.  which  will  not,  at a mimimum, use Russell's inter-
  pretation of the Chart of the Elements.

  What, then, is the difference between  matter  and  energy?   If  energy is
  measurable, then it  is  dependent  upon atoms, as is matter.   When  atoms
  become "caught" in   resonant  vortical  flows,  they  become  more  highly
  structured, and energy becomes matter.  Further, when external energies are
  applied, the matter is changed.  We regularly  convert  matter into energy.
  Russell converted matter  into matter of another form,  and  turned  energy
  into energy of  another  form.   Can  we,  then,  turn  energy into matter?
  Because this, according to Russell, is how nature creates the forces which
  result in galaxies, it may yet be possible  to  do in a laboratory.  Nature
  uses fusion, which  results in hydrogen being converted  into  all  of  the
  known elements.

  Russell felt that  we  misunderstood  the fusion reaction of stars, because
  our understanding is based upon gravity, and we do not understand gravity.
  He described gravity as a quadrupole  force  which  results  from  the spin
  energy of atoms.  Gravity does not "pull" like a magnet.  Gravity,

  according to Russell,  is a cyclical flow of energy into opposing vortices,
  which then control the expansion of matter, based upon temperature.

  Gravity, then, holds us together, not down.  However, because our matter
  is not IN  the atmosphere, but OF the  atmosphere,  comprised  of  resonant
  atoms, we are  held  together  with the earth.  The size  of  the  vortical
  flows, and thus  the  gravity,  will  increase  as  the  number of atoms is
  increased, because each atom adds vortical, resonant energy to the mass.

  Defeating gravity, then,  would  depend  upon  creating  opposing  resonant
  vortical flows, which are a scale of the earth's vortices, relative to the
  mass of the  object.   Increasing  gravity, or the appearance  of  gravity,
  would use the same process in reverse.  Spinning a pyramid, for example, in
  a counterclockwise direction  in  the  northern  hemisphere, will cause the
  "weight" of the pyramid to increase,  as  the  spin rate becomes a scale of
  the earth's vortical  flow rate.  This has been reported  before,  but  not
  explained in terms of Russell's theories.

  Globally, gravity can  be weakened, if resonant energies are released which
  are of opposing phase, relative to earth's  vortices.   This would "unglue"
  or weaken the integrity of the planet and atmosphere, causing instabilities
  in temperature, manifested in severe storms as well as in earthquakes.

  Strengthening gravity would have a similar effect.  Any unbalancing  of the
  natural vortical flows  will  result  in instability.  Perhaps this is what
  Tesla had in mind, when he asked Russell  to  lock  up his discoveries (for
  1000 years because man was NOT yet ready for them).

  Also, this may help to explain how bucking coils, which  are  described  in
  Russell's Wave of  Creation,  tend  to drain energy.  Your thoughts on this
  are welcome.

  Vangard Notes

     A fascinating dissertation on Russells  work.  The comment regarding the
     draining of energy in the presence of bucking coils might  relate to the
     problems associated  with  the Sweet VTA and other devices which produce
     what is called "cold current".

     At the ISNE conference, one of the speakers mentioned that he had spoken
     with a fellow who reported that Russian experiments with devices similar
     to the VTA had also produced negative  health effects.  We are told that
     Sweet himself is frequently ill after being in the presence  of  the VTA
     when it  is generating power.  And it is known that experimenters in the
     field of Radionics have experienced  peculiar  energy  draining  effects
     which lead to illness or death.

     In discussions we've had with Tom Bearden, he says he has found a way to
     phase conjugate and thus suppress these negative health  aspects,  which
     offers hope  for  the  practical  use of such devices, that is, once the
     instabilities are  ironed  out.    We  hope  to  have  the  details  for
     conditioning the Sweet VTA online in the very near future  as  presented
     at the  ISNE  conference  by Don and Mike Watson and confirmed by Walter
     Rosenthal.  Floyd Sweet could not  attend  the ISNE conference, but Mike
     Watson placed a call to inform him of results achieved  by  Don  Watson.
     Once Sweet  heard how Don had conditioned his barium ferrite magnets, he
     responded, "It's about time someone figured it out!".
