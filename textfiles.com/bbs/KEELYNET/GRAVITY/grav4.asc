                                Odic-Activity Rays

       The odic-activity ray,  more  powerful  than the x-ray or the radium
       ray, is to completely conquer the air.

       The giant sky liner, safe as any conveyance ever perfected, equal in
       luxury and comfort to the palatial greyhounds of the ocean lanes, is
       a possibility and probability of the near future.

       These statements were made by Professor  Edgar  L.  Hollinghead,  in
       May, 1921:

          For, he declares, "this powerful ray will make  metals  so  light
          that a huge steel sky ship would become light as a bubble.

          Not only  this,  but the odic-activity ray will take the place of
          radium, valued  at  $120,000   a   gram,  and  revolutionize  the
          scientific world in the treatment of certain diseases.

          And the cost of lightening metals, of using the  rays for medical
          purposes, is  so  minute  as  to be almost negligible.  The odic-
          activity ray so far has ;

               1)  successfully CHANGED THE  WEIGHT of metal over 100 times
                   in as many tests;
               2)  it has caused hard clay to explode the  instant  the ray
                   touched it;
               3)  rock, opaque to the eye, has been made transparent
               4)  and  by  means of the ray, an actual photograph has been
                   taken through a solid sheet of lead.

          One application of the ray on  metal  has  caused  it  to  BECOME
          PERMANENTLY COLD  -  beyond  the  possibility  of  ever  becoming
          heated.

          And it  has  INSTANTLY  CHANGED  WATER  INTO  ITS PRIMARY GASES -
          hydrogen and oxygen.

          But of  all  uses  of  the  ray,  including treatment for medical
          purposes, that of LIGHTENING  METALS  is  the  greatest  and will
          revolutionize the traffic of the world."

       Vangard note...

          We know, by now you are asking "What the hell is this all about?"
          The article is just as it came from the book.  As  to  what range
          these mysterious  odic-activity rays fall in the electro-magnetic
          spectrum, we include the following  lengthy  chart  also from the
          same book.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------
        Visible light is rated in Angstroms (1 - 10/billionth of a meter).
                   Red light is between 6500 to 6700 Angstroms,
                          Yellow is between 5900 to 6000,
                          Green is between 5100 to 5700,
                           Blue is between 4500 to 5000.
         1 Angstrom  = 1 Teracycle or one million million cycles per second
                or 1 times 10 to the 12th or 1,000,000,000,000 CPS.
        Note we, in line with other researchers  of "Borderline" science do
             not recognize HERTZ as the designator for periodic waves.
