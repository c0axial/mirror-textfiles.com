       ******************

       A very rare set of 2 reports issued in the 1950's on the classified
       work of T. T. Brown prepared by Aviation Studies Ltd. in London for
       the U.S.  military, recently declassified in the U.S., is available
       from:

       Electrogravitics Systems:
       ------------------------
       A look into the simple yet effective principle of high voltage
       electrostatic creation of a local gravitational well, providing
       reactionless propulsion.  Includes a 1993 electrogravitics paper
       "The U.S. Antigravity Squadron" by Dr. Paul LaViolette, presented at
       the Institute for New Energy 1st International Symposium on New
       Energy, who also unearthed these two Aviation Studies Ltd. reports.
       #P3;  100 pages.  $15 + $2 S/H = $17.00  ($5 S/H overseas)
