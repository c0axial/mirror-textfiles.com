Notice: I discovered this document in 1992 and felt after discussing it with
others on the Internet in 1995, that it may be of great use for both engineers
and other researchers who are part of the Keelynet.  This includes serious UFO
researchers who investigate technical properties.

I further believe this type of propulsion may be what has been seen over New
York, Belgium in the past 10 years.

over many nations.   The A.C. Holt Document A80-38979 "Prospects for a

The speculative "propulsion" concept described in this paper was presented at
a special session of the 15th Joint AIAA/SAE/ASME Propulsion Conference (June
18-20, 1979), "Propulsion Concepts for Galactic Spacecraft".  The concept was
developed as the result of private, unofficial research. NASA is not involved
in UFO research.  However, the research which may be stimulated by this paper
could result in the verification of essential elements of this concept and in
feasibility studies concerning the development of a new generation of NASA
spacecraft.

                                   ABSTRACT

A new propulsion concept has been developed based on a proposed resonance
between coherent, pulsed electromagnetic wave forms and gravitational wave
forms (or space-time metrics).

Using this concept, a spacecraft "propulsion" system potentially capable of
galactic and inter-galactic travel without prohibitive "travel times" has been
designed.

The "propulsion" system utilizes recent research associated with magnetic
field line merging, hydromagnetic wave effects, free-electron lasers, laser
generation of megagauss fields, and special structural and containment metals.

Research required to determine potential, field resonance characteristics and
to evaluate various aspects of the spacecraft "propulsion" design is
described.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                     FIELD RESONANCE "PROPULSION" CONCEPT

ASSUMPTIONS
-----------

The field resonance "propulsion" concept has been developed utilizing recent
research into causes of solar flares, magnetic substorms, black holes,
quasars, and UFOs. The concept is based on two assumptions:

   (1)  Space-time is a "projection" of a higher dimensional space in much
        the same way that a hologram is a projection or a subset of our space-
        time reality,
   (2)  A relationship exists between electromagnetic / hydromagnetic fields
        and gravitational fields - that is, Einstein's long sought for unified
        field theory can be developed.

Mathematical relationships have been developed and theoretical concepts have
been proposed to describe the causes and effects associated with the
assumptions, but experimental data is required to develop the correct
theoretical basis for the assumptions (Rachman and Dutheil, 1979). Specific
research in a number of areas is needed and will be described later.

ASTROPHYSICAL RESEARCH
----------------------

There does exist, however, some astrophysical data which tends to support
these assumptions. For example, astronomers have speculated that a
relationship may exist between black holes and quasars (white holes).

The energy and matter which leaves space-time in a black hole may reappear at
a white hole at some distant space-time point.  For this transfer of energy
from one space-time point to another to occur, some type of hyperspace or
higher dimensional space (4th & 5th) is required.

Assumption 2 may be the cause of the large amount of energy released in solar
flairs. In sunspot regions where solar flairs occur, the 2-3 thousand gauss
magnetic fields are configured such that the positive and negative polarities
are in close proximity with each other.

Where the positive and negative magnetic field lines are nearly anti-parallel
a process called magnetic field line merging can take place. In this process
the oppositely directed field lines break and re-connect expelling fields and
plasma out the sides. As a result magnetic energy is converted into kinetic
energy. The magnetic field line merging process has been proposed as the most
likely explanation for solar flare eruptions.

However, some flares can release energy which equals 10% of the suns' total
output in a second. This large amount of energy is difficult to achieve with
the magnetic field line merging concept. Thus it may be that the configuration
of the magnetic fields and associated hydromagnetic waves (oscillation of
field lines) may induce a "resonance" with gravitational fields resulting in a
release of gravitational as well as magnetic energy.

It is well known that the geometrical relationships of the magnetic fields
(and thus the field gradients) are more important to the production of solar
flairs that the magnitude of the field strength. A strongly convoluted
boundary between magnetic polarities results in a high probability for large
and frequent flares.

Another fact of interest is that hydromagnetic waves generated by solar flare
have been observed to propagate across the chromospheric surface and trigger
flares in other sun spot regions.

Alfven waves, which appear to be the dominant wave form involved, change only
the geometry of the field lines. This effect also indicates that the
initiation of solar flares definitely depends on geometrical relationships as
do the properties of space-time and gravitational fields.

Magnetic field line merging has also been used to explain the interaction of
the solar wind (and associated fields) with the Earth's magnetic fields at the
magnetopause and the generation of magnetic substorms which often are
triggered by solar flairs. The magnetic fields line merging process is also an
essential part of the field resonance "propulsion" concept.

UFO RESEARCH
------------

UFO studies indicate that the unexplained (residual UFO) phenomena may be due
to extraterrestrial visitors, parapsychological experiences, or a combination
of the two. If some UFO phenomena are caused by extraterrestrial visitors in
very advanced spacecraft, then the frequency of visits and the larger number
of different types of visitors (many different humanoids have been described)
imply an ability to cross large stretches of galactic and inter-galactic space
in relatively short time frames.

If the speed of light is a true limit of velocity in space-time, then the
potential extraterrestrial visitors must utilize a form of transportation
which transcends space and time to keep the trip times short. UFOs are often
observed to disappear instantaneously. In a subset of these cases, the UFO
later reappears at a nearby location implying a a disappearance from and a
reappearance into space-time.

The high speed, right angle turns, abrupt stops or accelerations of UFOs, and
the absence of sonic booms despite calculated speeds of 22,000 mph or more
suggest that UFOs may generate an artificial gravitational field or otherwise
use properties of space-time which we are not familiar with.

UFO propulsion systems appear to involve electromagnetic or hydromagnetic
processes as evidenced by radiative effects on the environment such as burns,
dehydration, stopping of automobile engines, TV and radio disruptions, melting
or alteration of ground and road surfaces, power disruptions, and static
electricity effects. This data suggests that the unknown relationship between
electromagnetic and gravitational fields may be used in UFO propulsion
systems.

HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF PROPULSION CONCEPT
--------------------------------------------

The concept of transcending space-time for interstellar and intergalactic
travel was felt to be a viable possibility based solely on theoretical studies
in physics and astrophysics and UFO studies.  But with the postulation and
potential discovery of black holes, the potential for experimental support for
this concept in the near future has been established.

Astronomers have already speculated on the possibility that the mass and
energy absorbed by a black hole may reappear in white holes or quasars. For
mass and energy to be transported from one space-time point to another without
an observable connection implies some form of higher dimensional space
transcending space-time as we know it.

The existence of a higher dimensional space would open up new space travel
possibilities since the connections between space-time points through this
hyperspace could involve laws much different than those which are so
constraining in space-time.

For example, if each space-time point can be assumed to be unique and if a
relationship does exist between gravitational and electromagnetic fields, then
each space-time point defined by a geometric form (Einsteins tensor metric)
would be expected to have natural resonances with certain electro/hydro
magnetic wave forms (geometric forms) which are (effectively) higher or lower
harmonics of that space-time point (which is a "projection" of higher
dimensional space).

The potential existence of the space-time harmonics mean that if a craft at a
specified space-time point artificially generate a configuration of electro-
/hydromagnetic fields which has a resonance with a distant space-time point, a
basic imbalance would be created.

This imbalance would be out of harmony with the "projection laws" which create
the space-time properties from higher dimensional properties. Forces would be
set in motion to re-establish a balance which in this case require that the
craft and its fields be located at the space-time point where such field
configurations are a natural harmonic of that space-time metric.

The best analogy in every day life is that of tuning a radio. The tuning knob
in this case is the spacecraft's mechanism for changing the configuration of
the magnetic wave form. The radio stations are various space-time points. For
a radio, the signal (which is always there) is manifested through the speakers
associated with the radio, for the field resonance system the speakers exist
only at the radio station.

Once the spacecraft's magnetic wave form is tuned into a distant space-time
point, that wave form is forced to manifest only at that space-time point
according to the "projection laws".

A means of generating the electro-/hydromagnetic configurations which would be
required remained a problem until the study of magnetic field line merging and
hydromagnetic wave effects was undertaken. With the completion of recent
thesis research, a possible means for generating the magnetic wave was
determined (Holt, 1979).

This research along with the results of fusion research resulted in the
proposed implementation of a spacecraft which generates megagauss magnetic
fields which are oppositely directed. These oppositely directed field lines
will merge and re-connect expelled field lines and plasma out to the sides.

In this initial concept, expelled field lines again meet oppositely directed
field lines and merge again, possibly forcing large amounts of electromagnetic
and hydromagnetic radiation outside the craft. This concept is currently
undergoing revision.

FIELD RESONANCE CONCEPT
-----------------------

In the proposed implementation high powered lasers are used to generate the
megagauss fields by the effects of non-colinear temperature and density
gradients (Kruer and Eastabrook, 1977; Max et al., 1978; Nishihara and Ohsawa,
1976).

By alternately pulsing adjacent laser sets, the location of the merging
process can be made to oscillate back and forth at a desired rate. The amount
of laser energy can be varied to alter the strength of the magnetic fields.
Thus by changing the laser's power and/or wavelength and the pulse frequency,
the resultant magnetic wave form can be changed or tuned to the desired
harmonic of a distant space-time point.

If flight to a nearby location is desired, the magnetic wave form can be
continuously re-tuned allowing very quick and short space-time
transformations.

For an observer it would appear to be a smooth flight in much the same way
that we do not see the individual frames of a film. For large jumps or travel
to very distant space-time points, some means of preventing the tuning to
intermediate space-time points is required.

In recent thesis work it was shown that hydromagnetic waves can inhibit or
enhance magnetic field line merging depending on a number of factors including
the magnitude and frequency of the hydromagnetic waves (Holt, 1979). Thus by
generating the appropriate hydromagnetic waves, the generation of a coherent
magnetic wave form can be prevented until the laser characteristics have been
adjusted so as to generate the magnetic wave form which is a harmonic of the
distant space-time point. Then the hydromagnetic waves can be stopped and the
magnetic wave form can develop.

The medium in which the magnetic field line merging occurs (vacuum, ionized
gas, etc), energy storage requirements, the pumping mechanism for the lasers,
and crew control interfaces are currently being studied. To avoid large energy
storage requirements, magnetic pumping of the lasers may be utilized to allow
a reuse of a portion of the laser energy which is otherwise radiated.

It may also be possible to obtain substantial energy during the initial part
of the process of tuning to a new space-time point through the resonance with
gravitational fields. By allowing the craft to continuously shift or oscillate
to new, nearby space-time points, a continual supply of energy could be
obtained while in a hovering mode.

The oscillation could be accomplished by the modulation of magnetic field line
merging by adjusting hydromagnetic wave parameters. This technique would
provide energy for the lasers without disrupting major laser re-tuning
processes.

The outer shape of the proposed spacecraft is a "winged disc". The wings would
be used for testing purposes only and could later be eliminated following
sufficient testing (Grief and Tolhurst, 1963).

RESEARCH REQUIRED
-----------------

The magnetic field line merging process and the effects of varying associated
parameters requires extensive study. Specific laboratory tests should be
conducted, some of which could be conducted in association with fusion
research. These tests should be supplemented by computer modeling studies and
the collection of experimental data on magnetic field configurations and
hyromagnetic wave fluctuations before and after solar flares and geomagnetic
substorms.

The generation of megagauss magnetic fields by high powered lasers and the
effects of varying laser parameters should be studied in laboratory
experiments. Much of this research could be accomplished in association with
fusion research. Containment and protective materials and structures for the
spacecraft could also be a by-product of fusion research. The pumping of
lasers by the use of magnetic fields should also be studied in laboratory
experiments.

Extensive measurements of the radiation emitted by UFOs would be extremely
useful in gaining insight into the physics and technology UFOs may represent.
These measurements should include photographic spectra (using special filters
for cameras), magnetic measurements (using high sensitivity detectors),
recording of radio frequencies, and the use of geiger counters to detect high
energy particles. A large distribution of special detectors, as described
above, should be made to UFO investigators, police departments, and other
interested individuals. In addition, portable modules containing sophisticated
detectors should be located at strategic positions in various countries to
allow rapid transport to high activity areas.

Effects on minerals, plants, animals, and humans should be studied to gain
insight into radiation emitted by UFOs. Effects on humans such as burns,
symptoms of radiation sickness, and other body changes should be thoroughly
investigated by physicians.

Regressive hypnosis should be used extensively to obtain technologically
valuable information from UFO close encounter participants.

Three dimensional models of exterior and interior of UFOs should be made for
cases which are significant from a technological point of view.

As soon as some of the basic interactions are better understood or after a
thorough review of the state of the art of hydromagnetic interactions is
completed, small scale test models of the propulsion system and spacecraft
should be constructed and extensive testing performed. The testing should
proceed hand-in-hand with the results of other research. Several test models
may be needed in case one or two are "lost".

FINAL COMMENTS
--------------

Since the field resonance concept utilizes two unproven assumptions and
currently unverified magnetohydrodynamic processes, the concept is likely to
require extensive modification and perhaps a complete revamping following
initial research activity and subsequent feasibility studies.

I am confident, however, that the research accomplished under the motivation
of this or a similar propulsion concept will result in theoretical and
technological advances and ultimate break through in propulsion and energy
systems.
