       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                 This is a letter to the Editor of the now defunct
                      Flying Saucer magazine of January 1963.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Dear Ray (Palmer - Editor);

            I postulate,  here,  an hypothesis, or possible explanation for
       the numerous plane  (particularly   jet)  crashes.   By  correlating
       several theories I come to this general hypothesis.

            The first  theory  is  that  there  exists, in  certain  areas,
       NEGATIVE ENERGY or, perhaps better stated, REVERSE GRAVITY "fields".

            By this  I  mean  that  within the perimeter, extending upward,
       gravity operates IN REVERSE.  I refrain from further explanation, by
       quoting examples and such, for fear of "contradicting" statements to
       follow, thus ridding this discussion of needless confusion.

            This second theory is basically  that  of Shaver with regard to
       gravity.  First, says Shaver's theory, gravity is  NOT  A  PULL FROM
       WITHIN, but A PUSH FROM WITHOUT.

            This push  is  accomplished  by  the  planetward flow of "exd".
       This "exd", for those unfamiliar  with  Shaver's  theories,  is  the
       intermediate stage in  the  TRANSFORMATION  OF  MATTER  INTO  ENERGY
       (called integrance).

            EXD, by  the  way, is ex-disintegrance.  (Which came first, the
       proverbial chicken or the egg - disintegrance or integrance?)

            The exd particle is the ash  of  transformation.   The  fall or
       condensation of exd  into  matter,  CAUSING FRICTION,  PRODUCES  the
       force we call gravity.

            Now, I postulate, by correlating these two theories, that there
       is some electro-magnetic  force  set up (responsible for the reverse
       gravity) that COUNTERACTS  THE  INFLUX   OF   EXD  (responsible  for
       gravity), thus producing a ZONE OF ZERO GRAVITY.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Vangard note..

            We must bring up two items of interest at this juncture,

                  1)  EXD  can be thought of as TACHYON energy,  AETHER  or
                      ZPE,
                  2)  Friction  as  used here can be translated into modern
                      terms as interference  since  this  energy  moves  in
                      waves and  can  be  "collided"  against   itself   to
                      generate resistance and therefore matter.

            We suggest  you download NEUTRAL1 to get an idea of the Vangard
            approach to trying to understand the Universe.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

            This zone of zero gravity extends,  probably,  to the extremity
       of the electro-magnetic   force's   influence,  more   than   likely
       DECREASING as the distance from the Earth INCREASES.

            Further, the negative area's effect IS VARIABLE, that is, it is
       regular or irregular.

            (Let me clarify the last statement in paragraph three.  If, for
       example, I had  said  that  when  gravity  works in reverse, objects
       WOULD NOT BE  PULLED  DOWN,  but would  BE  PUSHED  UP,  this  would
       contradict a statement, as an example, in the following paragraph.

            This statement  would have been that objects  are  PUSHED  DOWN
       TOWARD the planet,  rather  than BEING PULLED DOWN.  You can see the
       confusion and contradiction set up.)

            We are to assume that the force  of  exd  is  INFINITELY  LONG-
       LIVED, because of  the  CONTINUOUS TRANSFORMATION of  energy/matter.
       Thus, if the  negative energy "source" was cut (or turned?) off, the
       exd would AGAIN FLOW DOWNWARD.

            Thus, if any object happened  into  this  area  AS  THE EXD WAS
       FLOWING BACK, it would be carried, or PUSHED, downward at once to be
       stopped by the earth, or any other planet, for that matter.

            This is  the  theory;  that  planes  happen into  these  areas,
       resulting in this inevitable doom.

            A point to ponder would be the application of this effect in an
       artificial manner for propulsion of saucers.

            Of course,  as was hinted in a previous paragraph, this coud be
       the work of the DERO of Shaver's  caves.   They  could  control  the
       apparatus to counteract the INFLOW OF EXD.

            It is  stated  as fact, through fictional surroundings,  in  "I
       REMEMBER LEMURIA" that  this  was  a form of transportation, that of
       counteracting the force of INFLOWING  EXD and being PROPELLED UPWARD
       by some SECONDARY FORCE.

            (Let me  comment on this theory and others in general.   First,
       let me say  that I am a major (in school) in Mathematics and Science
       (particularly Physics).  Through   studying   Mathematics,   I  have
       learned a few facts other than those presented in the  texts  (if at
       all they ARE facts).

            Everyone knows,  if  they have studied Mathematics at all, that
       the whole scheme is based upon unknowns  and  assumptions.  By using
       common sense, anyone should be able to see that the scheme itself is
       an assumption or unknown.

            Mathematicians say they can prove their statements.  I say they
       CANNOT.  There is a form of "proof" known as Mathematical  INDUCTION
       that is used extensively to "prove" their statements.  The

                                      Page 2





       perplexing discovery here   is   that   they   CANNOT   PROVE   that
       Mathematical induction is foolproof,  without, of course, using some
       other form of  "proof"  which cannot be proved without,  of  course,
       using some other form of "proof" which - ad infinitum!

            (This whole   scheme   called   Mathematics  is  enigmatic  and
       sometimes paradoxical.  Of course,  no  one will doubt the handiness
       of this system.  We would be, most assuredly, lost without it.

            This brings  us  to the question asked so many  times,  namely,
       "What, in this  universe  of  ours, is PROVED?" I say, with grateful
       reassurance, that there are systems or schemes which ARE PROVED.

            Take, for example, Chemistry.   It  is  possible  to  take  two
       chemicals and combine them, by using some action, into  a  compound,
       COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from either of the two initial components.

            This compound  is  seen  to  be  formed  each  time  these  two
       chemicals are combined  in  this manne.   This  is  impossible  with
       Mathematics.  You can SAY two plus two is four you  will  be  right.
       But wouldn't it  be  just  as  much  possible to say two plus two is
       three or any other number?

            These mathematical quantities  we  call numbers are INTANGIBLE,
       thus, they CANNOT  be  explored and combined in a tangible  way,  as
       with chemicals.  It  is,  however,  possible  to  associate tangible
       quantities with the intangible numbers.   Two, for example, could be
       associated with the quantity of wings a bird has.

            (What would   happen  with  three  wings,  or   eliminate   the
       intangibility of this  statement and say more wings than most birds?
       Think this isn't  possible?   Prove   it!)   As  can  be  seen  this
       possibility nullifies this system of "proof" and it  becomes no more
       a system of proof.)

            Webster says  a  theory  is  an  explanation  based  on certain
       available information, or something to that effect.  What puzzles me
       is that he fails to say that a theory  is  unproven, which indeed it
       is.  My theory is based on two other theories, EACH UNPROVEN, and is
       thusly, UNPROVEN.

       Vangard note...

            We have had the distinct pleasure of meeting Mr. Walter Wright,
            THE modern proponent of the PUSH GRAVITY theory which will soon
            be listed on KeelyNet.

            Mr. Wright has many proofs and excellent models  to  verify his
            contentions.  Videotapes   of   his  models  in  operation  are
            excellent and have served to  convince  many scientists and lay
            people of the validity of the PUSH GRAVITY model.

            We refer  you  also to the work of Dr. Hans Nieper,  listed  on
            KeelyNet as TACHYON1 and TACHYON2.

            This article also touches on the many strange disappearances in
            the Bermuda Triangle, the Devils' Triangle, the Sargasso sea as
            well as the likes of Judge Crater.

            We can't  forget  about  the  mysterious teleportations where a
            person or object is lifted up  and  set  back  down hundreds of
            miles away from his original location.  Many of these have been
            attributed to UFO's or paranormal causes.

            It is  just  as  reasonable to include the possibility  that  a
            NEGATIVE GRAVITY  ZONE  suddenly appears in which the victim is
            accidentally caught.

            An unexpected uprising of air and other material in the path of
            the NEGATIVE GRAVITY FIELD could  create a dazed or unconscious
            state, not  to  mention the possibility of low  level  magnetic
            stimulation to  create  hallucinatory experiences as researched
            by Persinger.

            For more on induction of such experiences, refer to the BIOLOGY
            section on KeelyNet and the files MIND5, MIND6, MIND7, MIND8.
