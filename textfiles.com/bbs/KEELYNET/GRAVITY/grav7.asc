                    Discovery of the Second Law of Gravitation

                                by Craig Gunnufson

       Almost everyone has  heard  the  story  in which an  apple  fell  on
       Newton's head and  this led to the discovery of the Universal Law of
       Gravitation, which is:

            "Any two bodies attract each other with a force proportional
             to the product of their masses  and  inversely proportional to
             the square  of  the  distance  between  them  (F-GMm/r'2  (for
             '2=squared))"

       I belive I  have  made  a  very fundamental discovery which could be
       called the Second Universal Law of Gravitation.  It came about as an
       outgrowth of my  Ether  Displacement  Theory.   The  Second  Law  of
       Gravitation states :

            "Matter absorbs and re-radiates energy from the medium (ether)
             which is responsible for the phenomenon known as gravitation.
             The rate  of  energy  being  radiated is proportional  to  the
             square of the mass."

                  (Note that radiation indicates PUSH....Vangard)

                               dE/dt = kM'2 = power,

                   k = 7.2 X 10'-34 (to the -34th) erg/gm'2 sec

       Therefore, an intrinsic property of matter is that it absorbs energy
       from the ether.

       The rate of acceleration of a falling object, which acquires kinetic
       energy is a measure of energy flow via conduction through the ether.

       For example, under Newton's law of gravitation, if one of the masses
       in question is doubled, it would follow that force and therefore the
       rate of acceleration would double.

       Since the kinetic  energy is proportional to the second power of the
       velocity, we would also expect the  energy flow via conduction to be
       proportional to the second power of the mass times the constant.

       The solar energy  output  is  not less than 3.89  X  10'33  (to  the
       33rd)erg/sec.  If we assume that fusion and gravitational mechanisms
       are the only  methods  of  energy  production,  then  the ether must
       supply 2.8 X 10'33 erg/sec since the  neutrino  measurements account
       for only 27% of the Sun's energy.

       From laboratory work it is known that nuclear fusion  reactions give
       off neutrinos.  It has been generally accepted that the Sun's energy
       is the result  of  fusion  but,  over  the  last 10 years, counts of
       neutrinos emitted by the sun have been less than expected.

       In "SCIENCE", January 1976, J.N.  Bahcall and R. Davis, Jr. reported
       finding only 1.5 Solar Neutrino Units  (SNU).   Under  the  standard
       solar model, 5.5 SNU were expected.  If these figures  are  correct,
       then only 27% of the Sun's energy may be produced by fusion.

       The "K" was  calculated  to  be  7.2  X  10'-34 erg/gm'2 sec.  It is
       recognized that this value of "K"  is a first approximation since it
       is likely that celestial bodies contain other energy  processes  and
       the neutrinos measured  may  be general background levels.  Based on
       this value the predicted minimum  energy  output  of other celestial
       bodies were then calculated :

         Celestial Body            Mass (M) gms        Predicted Output
           Earth                  5.97 X 10'27           2.60 X 10'22
           Jupiter                1.88 X 10'30           2.50 X 10'27
           Saturn                 5.60 X 10'29           2.30 X 10'26
           Neptune                1.00 X 10'29           7.20 X 10'24
           Uranus                 8.60 X 10'28           5.30 X 10'24
           Alpha Centauri "A"     2.15 X 10'33           3.33 X 10'33
           Alpha Centauri "B"     1.75 X 10'33           2.20 X 10'33
           Alpha Centauri "C"     2.39 X 10'32           4.10 X 10'31
             (where ' preceding a number indicates to the tenth power)

       There is much  disagreement among geophysicists as  to  the  Earth's
       total rate of   energy   dissipation.   Values  of  heat  quantities
       measured are on the order of magnitude  of  10'20  erg/sec (Sclater,
       "Review Geophys. Space Physics", Vol. 18. p. 269-300).

       However, Williams and Von Herzen pointed out in 1974  that much more
       heat could be lost due to hydrothermal circulation of sea water.

                                      Page 2





       Some estimates place  this  heat  loss  at  100  times  greater than
       continental heat loss.  Therefore,  at  the  present time, the total
       energy released by the earth is highly speculative.   My calculation
       of 2.6 X 10'22 erg/sec is within the range of possibilities.

       From the data  received  by  the  probes sent to Jupiter there is an
       outer layer of atmosphere that is  quite cold, but under this colder
       layer is a   much   hotter   layer,  around  440  degrees   Celsius.
       (Encyclopedia Americana, Vol. 16, p. 254, 1979).

       Because the outer  layer  acts  as  insulation, we would expect only
       some portion of the energy radiated by the inner layer to escape the
       planet.  Using the Stefan-Boltzmann  law it is possible to calculate
       the upper limit of the rate of energy lost through radiation.

       E = kT'4 = (5.7 X 10'-5) (713 degrees K)'4 = 1.47 X 10'7 erg/cm'2sec

       Esubt = E(area) = (1.47 X 10'7) (6.48 X 10'20) = 9.5 X 10'27 erg/sec

       Since some portion  of  this  amount is able to escape  through  the
       outer layer, then  my  figure  of  2.5  X  10'27  erg/sec  is within
       probable range.

       Newton himself recognized that bodies  were attracted to each other,
       but the actual  mechanism remained a mystery to him.   In  the  19th
       Century, Lesage theorized that a medium of hyperfine particles could
       account for the inverse square law discovered by Newton.

                         Lesage's theory also showed that
                   GRAVITY IS A PUSH, NOT A PULL OR ATTRACTION.

       Since then, there  have  been  others  who have come up with similar
       theories independently.

            (Walter Wright of Fairfield, California is the leading
             exponent of the Push Gravity theory as first noted by his
             then 6 year old son, Walter  has  since  fleshed  the idea out
             into a  complete  and  logical  system  which  we  of  Vangard
             Sciences/KeelyNet fully support.....Jerry Decker/Ron Barker)

       However, Lesagian theory  has  had its critics.  In recent times two
       of the most notable are Richard  Feynman  and  Willy  Ley.   In  his
       essay, "The Case  for  a  Lesagian  Theory  of  Gravitation",   that
       appeared in the  Association  for  Pushing  Gravity  Research,  1979
       Mutual Aid addition, John Kizer presented some of the arguments made
       by these critics.

       One of them is : "The friction generated  by  the  impacts  of these
                         ultra-mundane particles upon masses  such  as  the
                         earth would,  of  necessity, make the earth white-
                         hot within a short period of time."

       In this statement  the  critics  are  right  QUALITATIVELY  but  not
       QUANTITATIVELY.  My calculations show that the earth  DOES  NOT HAVE
       SUFFICIENT MASS to become white hot, BUT THE SUN DOES.

       It can be  seen  that  with  this  new  law  of  gravitation  we can
       calculate the rate of energy radiation  of  celestial bodies.  These
       rates confirm the idea that space, or the ether, has usable energy.

       There is much research presently going on for the purpose of tapping
       this energy.  This  confirmation  further legitimizes this important
       research.
