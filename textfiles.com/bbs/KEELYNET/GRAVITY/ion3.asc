                                PRIMARY PROPULSION

           Electric propulsion for primary spacecraft thrust is of interest
       for both near-Earth   and   interplanetary   missions.    Near-Earth
       applications include the spiral-out maneuvers from low to high orbit
       and Earth escape.

           Once at  high  orbit  the  thruster   may   also   be  used  for
       stationkeeping.  Interplanetary missions include flights  out of the
       ecliptic and flybys  past, or rendezous with, asteroids, comets, and
       planets.

           A primary electric propulsion  stage  could  offer large payload
       advantages as a  commercial  tug  in  conjunction   with  the  space
       shuttle.

           The interest  in  electric  propulsion  derives  mainly from the
       reduction in propellant requirements relative to chemical propulsion
       due to operation at increased specific impulse.

           One way  to compare the capability  of  an  electric  propulsion
       spacecraft with that of a chemical system is to consider  the  total
       impulse delivered by two such systems.

           A 1500-kilogram   electric   propulsion   spacecraft   with  500
       kilograms of propellant can deliver slightly more total impulse than
       a 2914 Delta  rocket stage, which  has  a  mass  of  5500  kilograms
       including 4500 kilograms of propellant.  Although exact comparisons
       are subject to  details of the propulsion system configuration,  the
       comparison just given  is  illustrative  of  the propellant savings,
       and, hence, overall mission performance  increases,  achievable with
       electric propulsion.

           To explain more fully the characteristics of a  primary electric
       propulsion system, the major elements are discussed in the following
       sections.
