VI.  PROJECTS OF EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION OF OUR NEW EXPLANATION OF
     GRAVITATION AND ITS UTILIZATION IN PRACTICE

The experimentum crucis of the first order is the use of gravitational energy
by transforming it into another form of energy -- particularly electricity.

A detailed project of the solution of the three principal technical problems
is proposed and generally characterized.  Radiational theory of gravitation
for the first time offers the possibility of setting and managing this task,
so important for the future of all mankind.

Gravitation is an inexhaustible source of energy, omnipresent, permanent,
easily available -- without any hard work imposed on man, without greater
costs and without any hazards involved.

Six projects of experimental verification of the manifestations of the Earth's
gravity are set up, i.e. measurement of the mechanical effect of cosmic
radiation upon a body placed in a huge radiational shade of the Earth.
Details of the first project carried out in 1950 in cooperation with a group
of experts from the National Institute of Geophysics in Prague are described.
A weight increase was gravimetrically determined in a deep shaft and in
adjacent places on all floors.  In spite of the fact that the found
departures were close to the limit of reliability, this unambiguous result can
be regarded as a support of our theory, stating that free arrival of cosmic
radiation is felt here.

The next group consists of 6 projects concerning cosmological research.  The
problem is testing the validity of the principle of variable speed of light.

VII.  RADIATIONAL THEORY OF GRAVITATION AND THE STRUCTURE OF MATTER PROBLEM.

The premises of the radiational theory of gravitation and some of the
consequences of this new conception are confronted with the findings on the
structure of matter.  They are the following problems:  (1) definition of
material radiation, (2) structure of material radiation, (3) interaction
between radiation and material macrosystems, (4) role of radiation in
interaction between so-called macroworld and atomic microworld, (5) problem of
the inner structure of a radiational minisystem, (6) the atom and radiational
minisystems, (7) the principle of variable speed of radiation, (8) energy of
material radiation, (9) quantum measure of the energy of material radiation,
and (10) material radiation and wave properties of matter.

Detailed analysis enables the author to make some conclusions and to propose
hypothetical suggestions of general nature.

The existence of a broad scale of minisystems of material radiation makes it
possible not only to solve the problem of space and nature of gravitation but
it also contributes to the solution of the problem of the structure of matter.

the idea that the so-called elementary particles are indivisible must be given
up.  On the contrary, interaction between atom and radiation shows that the
same universal structural feature of matter underlies both of these areas:
aggregation (inner binding) and dissociation of subsystems and minisystems of
always a lower order.  It was stated by V.I. Lenin at the beginning of this
century:  "Even the electron is inexhaustible".

As it was possible to explain atomic structure and intraatomic events on the
grounds of our knowledge of nucleons and electrons, also nucleons, electrons
and photons must be supposed and proved to be in fact material minisystems
binding (association) in themselves their inner constituents (i.e. minisystems
of a lower order).  Of the highest importance for understanding the structure
of the matter is the finding (derived from the relation between emission and
absorption of atomic radiation) that the radiational minisytems and bound
atomic particles are either identical or have their inner elements in common.

A hypothetical outline of the inner structure of photon, electron (negatron
and positron), neutron (two types: totally neutral and balanced), proton, and
antiproton, is presented.

Photon is a radiational minisystem of the (n-1) order.  The term photon is now
currently used to design the energetic quantum hv which is variable.  In the
author's opinion, it would be more logical to restrict it to an individual
minisystem of the (n-1) order whose sequence or chain or ray with a number v
of photon minisystems gives the quantum hv.  In this narrow sense, the photon
contains a pair of whirling infraphotons i.e. minisystems of the (n-2) order.

Electron is a sequence or ring of individual minisystems as well.  It probably
is the "planetary" type of a minisystem.  Its central constituent (nucleolus)
is made up of the aggregation of an infraneutron and infraelectron, its
orbiting constituent of an infraelectron carrying an opposite charge.
Infraelectrons may be identical with infraphotons.  The nucleoli composed of
infraneutrons and infraelectrons can be the corner-stones of the neutrons of
the atomic nucleus.

Neutron is a minisystem of the (n) order.  A neutron of balanced electric
charge may be a combination of an immense number of infraneutrons, nucleoli
of negatrons and nucleoli of positrons.  As subsystems of the neutron there
may develop whole minisystems of negatrons and positrons.  Violent
disintegration (the neutron bomb) can, moreover, release a highly penetrant
photon and infraphoton radiation.

Proton is a neutron devoid of the negatron.  Antiproton is a neutron devoid of
the positron.

Energy is not the antithesis of matter but the measure of the movement of
material macrosystems and minisystems of material radiation -- both of the
free total movement of the whole system and inner bound motion of its
constituents.

Photon contains a pair of infraphotons the masses of which are equal (m1 = m2
= m). The system travels at the translational velocity c.  The kinetic energy
E = 2 x 1/2 mc^2 = mc^2.

This relationship is formally identical with the famous Einstein's equation
of the equivalence of matter and energy.  It is an axiomatic consequence of
our theory of material nature of radiational minisytems.  It is not evidence
of the equivalence of mass and energy or, even, rejection of the concept of
matter and its replacement with energy.  On the contrary, the formula
expresses the kinetic energy of the material minisystem.  It can be applied
generally to all the systems of matter.

The total energy of a sequence v of photon minisystems flying at the speed
c is expresses in the relationship E(v) = mc^2v.  [In the original text E(v)
is written "E subscript v"]

Planck's famous equation giving the quantum nature of radiation at v frequency
is E(v) = hv.

Joining these two equations we obtain the relationship h = mc^2.  This means
that Planck's elementary quantum of effect h equals kinetic energy of a single
photon minisystem.

The quantum composition of radiation energy can be explained from the
existence of material radiational minisystems.

An oscillating pair of infraphotons travelling at the speed c gives waves of
the wavelength l and frequency v, while c = lv.  [in the original text l is
the symbol lambda]

The impulse of the whirling infraphoton pair of mass m has the value p = 2mc.
The kinetic energy of the pair E = 2 x 1/2 mc^2 = mc^2 = h.  Kinetic energy
of the whole photon sequence E(v) = mc^2v = hv.  Introducing the value mc =
h/c from h = mc^2 and substituting c = lv we get the impulse of the whole
photon as p(v) = 2mc = 2hv/c = 2hv/lv = 2h/l.  The wavelength (the same for
both infraphotons) is l = 2h/p(v).  For a single infraphoton l = h/p(v), which
is deBroglie's wave equation.  [In the original text p(v) is p subscript v]

The derivation of this formula is a direct consequence of our theory of
material radiation.  From the explanation of the structure of radiational
minisystems it follows that all mass, i.e. every material minisystem and
macrosystem, has wave manifestations, too.  It is, however, no "material wave
associated with mass" but always a manifestation of the inner, bound,
oscillating movement of constituents (subsystems, minisystems) of mass, i.e.
of systems of a lower order.

The premises and consequences of the radiational theory of gravitation do not
contradict hitherto findings but, on the contrary, they facilitate new
solution of some of the fundamental problems of the structure of matter.
