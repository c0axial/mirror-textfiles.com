                 Thrust from ElectroGravitics - Whatever THAT is..

       "It seems that  UFO  propulsion systems that utilize the terrestrial
       magnetic field are  theoretically   sound.    But  the  question  of
       practicability is something    that    comes   from    technological
       development of the  proposed system.  As yet, the Rotating Capacitor
       Space Drive I have proposed has not been reduced from the conceptual
       stage to the hardware stage.  The  principles  of  its operation are
       merely the result  of  the  applications  of  conventional  physical
       principles.

       "What is not   the   result   of  conventional  principles,  is  the
       possibility that the system I have  proposed may demonstrate some of
       Townsend Brown's electrogravitic effects (INTERAVIA,  Volume XI, No.
       5, 1956).  Electrogravitic  thrust,  under  this system, occurs only
       during the charging process and in  the  direction  of  the positive
       plate.

       In the Rotating  Capacitor,  using  the Wimshurst machine,  charging
       would be a continuous process because of the dielectric breakdown at
       some 'threshold voltage'.   The  possibility  of  getting additional
       thrust from electrogravitics is exciting, to say the least, and must
       be investigator thoroughly.

       "My library research shows that as early as 1917, a Professor Nipher
       had found that  the  weight  of  substances could be reduced (become
       negative) by the  application  of electrostatic  charges.  (Science,
       Sept. 21, 1917, page 173).

       Dr. Charles Brush, in a series of reports in the PROCEEDINGS  OF THE
       AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY  around  1922  found,  in  some well-
       thought-out-experiments, that weight  was  not  only proportional to
       mass, but was affected by the atomic structure of the substances.

       For example, he  found  that  for  a given unit of mass  and  shape,
       bismuth FALLS FASTER    than   zinc   or   aluminum,   in   complete
       contradiction to Newton's  Law  of  Gravity  which  they  are  still
       teaching in colleges today!

       Why have these experiments been ignored!  Why have these experiments
       been ignored?  What does the scientific community have  to say about
       the experiments of Townsend Brown, Brush and Nipher?

       So far, the  literature  hasn't  given  me an answer.  Incidentally,
       Otis Carr's work  involved  counter-rotating   charged   discs  that
       supposedly produced thrust  when  they  reached a certain  speed  in
       relation the the  earth's  rotational  speed and became activated by
       free energy from space.  Maybe he did have something."
