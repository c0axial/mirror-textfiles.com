                              SOFT PARTICLE PHYSICS:

               THE ERRONEOUS BASIC ASSUMPTION OF GENERAL RELATIVITY

                  by Richard L. Clark, Ph.D.  10 September, 1982


       The basic assumption of General Relativity (and the title of chapter
       20 of Einstein's book, Relativity) is:

            "The Equality of Inertial and Gravitational Mass as an
             Argument for the General Postulate of Relativity."

       The assumption is  that  gravitational  mass  and  inertial mass are
       equivalent.  Since the defined word  "Mass" appears in both sides of
       this supposed equivalence, this brief paper will  not  digress  into
       the misuses of  the  term  mass  in  current physics.  The important
       point is that inertia and gravity are neither equal nor derived from
       common functionings of the Universe.

       In fact, in the extreme limiting  cases,  gravity  can approach zero
       while inertia approaches infinity and, obviously, vise versa.  Since
       gravity and inertia have nothing in common, the claimed  equivalence
       is an absurdity.

       The real origins  and functioning of gravity and inertia are covered
       in the book  "Awesome  Life  Force"   by  Joseph  Cater  (1),  which
       describes a principle known as Soft Particle Physics.

       Gravity is   the   result   of  highly  penetrating  electromagnetic
       radiations entering a mass.  These gravity producing electromagnetic
       radiations, have a  frequency  of  approximately  1 trillion cps, (1
       terahertz) or just  below  the  infrared  portion  of  the  standard
       electromagnetic spectrum.  In  the  absence  of these  gravitational
       electromagnetic radiations, a mass has no gravity.

       Gravity radiation effects  were accidentally discovered in Poland in
       1927, (Kowsky & Frost), taken over by the Germans in World War II,
       liberated by the British and Canadians,  and found out by the United
       States in the 1950s.

       Inertia is the functioning of a mass's electrostatic field to oppose

                                      Page 1

       change.  When change  is  introduced  into, or exists within a mass,
       the electrostatic charges on the  atom  or  the  atomic  aggregates,
       transform part of their electrostatic fields to magnetic fields.

       This functioning is the phenomenon and concept we call  inertia, the
       third factor in   the   electrostatic   field   and  magnetic  field
       relationship.

       In the ancient wisdom of the Great Mother system of knowledge, which
       is Physics and  the  universal  realities  and  NOT  religion,  this
       subject was well known.

       The "One" became "Two" which generated the "Third", from which all
       manifestations originate.  The electrostatic field  is  the  One; it
       becomes Two with  movement or velocity on a charged particle to form
       a magnetic field, which generates the Third, or inertia factor.

       If the law of the conservation of  total  system energy is true, the
       magnetic field increases   directly   as  the  electrostatic   field
       decreases.  The potential  energy  (electrostatic  field) transforms
       into kinetic energy (magnetic field) of a moving charge.

       The inertia of a body IS this transforming function's ABILITY, or to
       put it another way, how much of the  electrostatic  potential  field
       BECOMES the magnetic  kinetic  field when a body is  given  movement
       (velocity).  Since total  energy of the system is constant, whatever
       the electrostatic charge is originally,  limits  the maximum inertia
       of a body.  All atoms and molecules have a charge; even the supposed
       "uncharged" atoms and  molecules  have  a  net  positive  charge  in
       reality.

       To paraphrase Cater  on  a  generalized  form  of  this  law, we can
       generalize Faraday's Law of Induced  electromotive  force  to  grasp
       this reality:  "The induced force produced by a change  in  velocity
       is always in  such  direction  as  to  oppose  any  change  in  this
       velocity."  This is  another  exact   definition  of  inertia.   The
       substitution of velocity  for  magnetic  flux in Faraday's  Law,  to
       generalize it, is  valid  because  both are of the same set class in
       reality.  For magnetic flux CAN ONLY  EXIST  with  velocity of body,
       particle, atom, etc., TRANSFORMED FROM the electrostatic field.

       (From the above  brief  explanation of what inertia  really  is,  it
       appears that the engineered control of it is possible.  If possible,
       inertia engineering may    stop    or   at   least   decrease,   the
       transformation of the electrostatic  field  to  the  magnetic field,
       since inertia is the result of this transformation.)

       It appears gravity and inertia have no real relationship  whatsoever
       to each other.   If  this  is  correct,  the famous equivalence is a
       fiction.  INERTIA is  an  INTERNAL   energy  system  phenomenon  and
       GRAVITY is an EXTERNAL energy system phenomenon.

       How much more different can they be?  The fact that  the weight of a
       body is directly  proportional  to  its inertial properties and that
       proportion is always constant, does  not  alter  the above analysis.
       For weight is   a  gravity  function  system,  or  external   energy
       absorption limiting constraint, which varies with each type of mass,
       thus hardly usable as Relativity has used it.

       Let us briefly  review  the "proofs" or "experimental confirmations"
       of General Relativity.  The three  most  famous  "proofs"  should be
       enough;

           1)  The perihelion of Mercury,
           2)  the deflection of light by a gravitational field,
           3)  and the displacement of spectral lines toward red.

       The motion in the perihelion of Mercury is so small  that  any error
       could exist.  There  exists  raw  data  which  denies  the  supposed
       deflection of light in a gravitational field.  In the May 1959 issue
       of Scientific American, pages 152  and  153, is a diagram of General
       Relativity's predicted position  of  stars and the  actual  observed
       position of stars during the 1952 total eclipse.  At least one third
       of the stars are displaced in the wrong direction between prediction
       and actual position.  Another one third make the right direction but
       are not even  near on position, predicted to actual.  This is proof?
       So much for curved space and warps, etc., and odd geometries.

       The displacement of spectral lines  toward  the  red  is the poorest
       proof of the three.  Here we have the "Big Bang"  and  other  not so
       famous theories tied  into  the plot.  This apparent Doppler effect,
       the shift toward red, is not proof  of  an  opening stellar velocity
       phenomenon at all.  The apparent Doppler effect,  or  red  shift, is
       common to all  light  and  is  part  of the Law of Redistribution of
       Energy.  When light interacts with  matter, new light results with a
       lower average frequency than the original light,  a  shift  to  red.
       This can be  demonstrated  by  taking a beam of light in the blue or
       violet end of the visible spectrum and pass it through a fairly long
       series of light filters.  The light  filters  can  be  ANY type, all
       blue, red, violet  or  combinations.  The light WILL  ALWAYS  emerge
       from the last  filter  as  RED  light,  if enough filters are passed
       through in the test.  In open space  the  star  light  traveling  to
       Earth has ENDLESS matter interactions, and thus, frequency drop, the
       shift toward red.

       From the above  it  appears  that the Theory of General  Relativity,
       obscures rather than reveals reality.
