                  ANCIENT APPLICATIONS OF PARTICLE BEAM WEAPONRY
                                        by
                              Robert L. Clark, Ph.D.
                                 December 8, 1982

       Particle beam weapons  and  devices were known in very ancient times
       and are part of the secret knowledge of several "mystery" schools to
       this day.  The use of the sun as  the  light  source for these helio
       particle beam devices  is  largely the reason for  the  various  sun
       worship religions.

       In this paper  only  three  aspects  of  this  helio  particle  beam
       technology will be covered, but many  other  "wonders" can easily be
       analyzed by the reader.  The three aspects to be covered briefly are
       Egyptian pyramid construction,  the  Ark of the Covenant  and  human
       levitation.

       The cutting, transport  and  placement  of the massive blocks of the
       pyramids and monuments were very  easy  once  Particle  Beam Systems
       were known.  Simple trigonometry, two gold plated metal  strips  and
       the sun, are the basic requirements.

       By proper angular  alignments,  the  powerful  beam sliced the giant
       blocks of solid rock into perfect  shapes.   Thus, by defocusing the
       helio particle beam, the massive blocks were impregnated with a high
       concentration of soft  particle electrons.  This high  concentration
       of soft particle  electrons'  extremely  negative  charge was simple
       antigravity.

       The massive blocks were then placed  and  fitted  exactly  using the
       helio particle beam  units.   After a period of time,  the  negative
       charge dissipates and  normal  weight  returns to these blocks.  The
       famous block walls and monuments  in  Central  and South America are
       examples of the use of this same technology.

       The Ark of  the  Covenant  is  a  very fancy version  of  the  helio
       particle beam device.   Again,  the  gold  plated, parallel mirrored
       interior, simple trigonometry and sunlight would defeat ANY army.

       Critically placed sun entry and exit beam holes were all that needed
       to be added to the biblical design.

       The defocused helio particles beam can be safely entered by humans.

       Humans in a  defocused  beam,  take  on a very high concentration of
       soft particle electrons;  a high  negative  or  antigravity  charge.
       Thus, one may  now perform levitation, "water walking"  or  "flying"
       feats to amaze the uninitiated.

       The above technological  feats are independent of religious or moral
       systems.  High technology  is  neither   good   or  bad.   Only  the
       utilization of such technology determines those qualities.
