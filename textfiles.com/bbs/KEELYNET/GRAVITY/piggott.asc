                              Overcoming Gravitation
                               By George S. Piggott

       For some time past there has been quite a controversy going on
       regarding the subject of interplanetary communication by means of
       electric waves. I have been much interested in the above on account
       of experiments which I have made and data collected pertaining to
       gravitation effects on high frequency oscillations and electronic
       discharges in general. A series of experiments which I conducted
       during the year 1904, caused me to formulate the theory that
       interplanetary  transmission  of  electrical  impulses  was  an
       impossibility  on  account  of  the  sun's  resisting  and absorbing
       influence  which  virtually  isolates  our  planet  from  all  other
       electrical vibrations of a lesser tension or power.

                       Gravitation Suspended in Experiments

       The above theorem was arrived at after I had succeeded in sustaining
       a metallic object in space by means of a counter-gravitational
       effect produced through the action of an electric field upon the
       above object. A strong electric field was produced by means of a
       special form of generator and when the metallic object was held
       within its influence it drew up to approximately a distance of 1 mm.
       from the center of the field, then was repelled backward toward an
       earthen contact, going within 10 cm. of the same when it was again
       attracted toward the field's center but this time getting no nearer
       than 5 cm. from the polar nucleus. This backward and forward
       movement continued for some time until the metallic object at last
       came to a comparatively stable position, about 25 cm. from the
       field's center where it remained until the power was shut off. While
       the metallic object was suspended, I was able to study the effect of
       the surrounding field and found by means of a powerful microscope,
       assisted by the insertion of a vacuum tube within the field, that
       the metallic object (having of course a certain electrical capacity)
       became fully charged and gave off a part of said charge to and
       against the surrounding field which tended to hold said object in
       space, apparently without any other sustaining influence. Around the
       outside of the metallic object and extending to a distance of about
       1/2 cm. was a completely dark belt or space in which there appeared
       to be no electrical agitation due, possibly, to neutralization
       caused by the contact of the large incoming energy supply from the

                                      Page 1





       field's  center  with  the  small  oscillating  radiations  from the
       metallic  object.  The  ever  changing  action  of  attraction and
       repulsion resulted in the overcoming of gravitation. Going farther I
       will state that the dark belt above mentioned after many tests gave
       no sign of electrification, a most astonishing phenomenon, inasmuch
       as its width was but 1/2 cm. In fact, a dark line was shown in the
       vacuum tube when it was introduced between metallic object and
       center of field. It is my firm coviction that somewhere on the outer
       confines of our planet there exists a similar counteracting belt
       through which naught but the gravitational vibrations of the sun
       penetrate, and these vibrations absolutely annihilate or absorb all
       other less powerful ones.

       Therefore, after making many experiments to ascertain as nearly as
       possible the absolute facts and conditions as they exist, I have
       come to the conclusion that all electrical disturbances not due to
       our own radio oscillations, on this globe are due to the sun's
       electrical activities in semi-inductional contact with our polar
       extremities.

                           Details of "Defying Gravity"

       The illustrations 1 to 4 will possibly give a fair idea of the
       apparatus used, and the manner in which the experiments were carried
       on.

       Fig. 1 shows general scheme of arrangement of devices. In the lower
       left hand corner is shown the "ground contact," which can be turned
       around and placed in any position found necessary, in fact, when a
       metallic object is in suspension, this ground can be entirely
       eliminated.

       I have found that any substance within the limits of my experiments
       can be held in suspension, viz: water globules, metallic objects,
       and insulators being among those tried. Some materials such as cork
       and wood exhibit peculiar activities when suspended; a piece of
       green maple would not rest in one position within the field, but
       oscillated backward and forward, continuously, going to the field's
       center, then back to ground.

       Heated  materials  exhibited  equally  peculiar  characteristics:  A
       silver ball 11 mm. in diameter when heated, remained farther away
       from the field's center than when at normal temperature; upon
       cooling it gradually drew up to the position it would occupy if
       unheated.

       [Fig. 1. - This picture shows Mr. George S. Piggott, the author, and
       his laboratory with the powerful electrical apparatus used, whereby
       he was enabled to carry on successful experiments in nullifying the
       effects of gravitation. In other words, he was able to suspend small
       balls and other objects in the manner shown, the silver balls
       actually used having weighed 1.3 grams. The diameter of the balls
       was 11 mm.]

       Fig. 2 shows a generator of the Wimshurst type (improved), the
       generating  or  collecting  units  being  entirely  enclosed  in  an
       insulating case and operated under a pressure of 3 atmospheres;
       completely dry air only, entering the case though the drying device
       attached to the air pump shown in Fig. 1. Interior parts of the

                                      Page 2





       generator will retain quite a powerful charge for a long period of
       time.

       [Fig. 2. - Special electro-static machine used by Mr.  Piggott in
       his gravitation nullifying experiments. Which was enclosed in a
       heavy-airtight compartment, so that it could be operated under
       several atmospheres of air pressure.]

       Fig. 3 illustrates suspension stand and field producing electrode,
       the latter can be revolved in any direction by means of a spring
       motor shown on the upper section of stand.

       The small apertures seen in the electrode, which is hollow, are
       there for the purpose of ascertaining the action of the reduced
       field tension at these points, and are also made use of to hold
       different sized metallic discs, which are cemented to insulating
       plates, forming condensers, the function of which is to create weak
       opposite polarities at these points and thus show a reaction on the
       suspended object and also a greater ocular effect in the vacuum
       tube.

       [Fig. 3. - A close-up view of the charged metal sphere mounted on a
       pedestal together with a spring driving motor, whereby the electrode
       or charged ball could be rotated. The two smaller silver balls are
       shown as suspended in mid air, the Earth's gravitational pull having
       been nullified.]

       Fig. 4 is a detailed drawing of the vacuum tube principally used;
       this is of the spectrum type, without sealed-in electrodes and when
       introduced into the electric field, glows very brightly at its
       extremities, especially giving a sharp line bordering the dark space
       around the metallic object. A very high vacuum is sustained in the
       tube and it is found necessary to build it of a very perfect
       insulating glass; the bulb must be kept absolutely dry on its outer
       surface.

       [Fig. 4. - Close-up view of vacuum tube of the spectrum type used in
       studying the aura surrounding the suspended silver balls, while they
       remained suspended in space.]

       Different  tubes  have  been  used  beside  the  above; corrugated
       spherical, cone shaped, and cylindrical, with various results.

       The electric field produced for suspension experiments is very
       powerful and intense, being detectable with a vacuum tube at a
       distance of over 6 meters (19.68 feet).

       In conjunction with the above and drawing an analogy between the
       same, I am of the opinion that cometary motion is undoubtedly due to
       the activity of its compositional elements and their susceptibility
       to changes of polarity, which, when the comet is far distant from
       the sun, would be opposite in sign to that of the latter, or when in
       close proximity to the central orb, would be of the same sign and
       therefore repelled.

       All bodies in process of formation possibly have their cometary
       stage, and doubtless future experiments will reveal this fact.

                      Actual Results Achieved by Mr. Piggott

       The total power required to operate generator, which was run by
       electric motor, was about 1/4 K. W. generator; the machine voltage
       was  in  the  neighborhood  of  500,000  when  the  electrodes  were
       separated beyond sparking distance. The electrostatic charge left on
       the suspension electrode retained the average object in space for a
       short length of time, about 1 and 1/4 seconds after machine ceased
       rotating.

       Some objects such as copper and silver balls, which are of course
       good  electrical  conductors,  and  very  nearly  homogeneous,  when
       falling toward the earth, after power had been shut off, seemed to
       slow down when they neared same, and hovered about 2 c.m. above
       contact for approximately 1 sec, of time before striking same; this
       was due now doubt to the inductional change of polarity which was
       imparted to balls almost at the instant of earth contact.

       The aura, shown in figure 3, near suspended balls (which in this
       experiment were made of silver) extended outward to a distance of
       about 1 c.m. and covered about one-half of the upper hemisphere and
       a trifle more of the lower hemisphere.  This bluish emanation
       appeared to be made up of numerous infinitesimal dots of darting
       particles, each apparently separated from the other by a very
       narrow, glowless belt. Everything was, however, in a constant state
       of agitation and it was quite impossible to get an absolutely
       perfect view microscopically, of an individual particle. Different
       substances have different aura both in length and breadth, and also
       in luminosity.

       The  silver  balls  used  in  these  experiments  had  an  actual
       gravitational  weight  of  1  and  3/10  grams  (nearly  .05 oz.,
       avoirdupois) and were the heaviest objects suspended at this time,
       their diameter being 11 mm. as before mentioned in another part of
       this article.

       The largest object suspended was a cork cylinder 10 c.m. long by 4
       c.m. diameter (approximately 4 by 1 and 9/16 inches) which had a
       copper wire pushed though its center and extending beyond its ends
       to a distance of 3 mm. The weight of above cylinder was 3/4 gram
       (.002645 oz.  avoirdupois).

       The behavior of metal spheres used in above experiments was a most
       interesting spectacle, silver and copper balls floated very steadily
       on one position and when suspending electrode was revolved, would
       follow and turn slightly axially, but would not revolve entirely
       around same, there being a peculiar "slipping" effect not entirely
       accounted for.
