                           Jueneman - On UFO Propulsion

       I rediscovered a  note  I  made  to  myself, dated in March of 1968,
       which stated:

          "Orientation of  orbital  electrons   in   a  PHASED  MATRIX  may
           radically change the structure of the crystal array  by ALTERING
           THE QUANTUM EFFECTS of the binding energy.

           The crystal  may become fluid IN A QUANTUM SENSE while retaining
           the structure of a crystal matrix."

       I may have been standing on my head at the time that was written.

       What this meant was that an electron  beam  -  usually  described in
       current parlance as bundles of electron pairs - channeling through a
       crystal matrix would be in phase with the atoms of  the  array AS IF
       THESE ATOMS ACTED AS WAVEGUIDES.

       In a hexagonal  crystal matrix having relatively few discontinuities
       and impurities, the interstices between  the atoms would essentially
       constitute a HARD  VACUUM,  and it should be eminently  possible  to
       have the equivalent  of  a  linear  accelerator  within inter-atomic
       INCREMENTAL SPACE instead  of  in   FREE   SPACE,  as  is  currently
       practiced using vast open-throated accelerators.

       As an adjunct to this, a circular or TOROIDAL array would augment or
       enhance SPECIFIC PHYSICAL  EFFECTS  which  would  NOT  otherwise  be
       apparent.

       The chain of  events,  including a conference on superconductivity I
       attended at Stanfor  in 1967, led  me  to  think  that  since  CUBIC
       CRYSTALS ARE A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR SUPERCONDUCTIVITY, there must
       be a hidden  phenomenon  in  those  crystalline forms  that  exhibit
       HEXAGONAL arrays.

       One of the   characteristics   of  metallic  hexagonal  crystals  is
       DIAMAGNETIC BEHAVIOR, and  the  thought   occurred  to  me  that  if
       diagmagnetic effects were ENHANCED several orders  of  magnitude  BY
       MEANS OF SUCH ELECTRON PAIRS channeling through a HEXAGONAL MATRIX,

                                      Page 1





       then the diamagnetic field generated could successfully grapple with
       even our weak  GEOMAGNETIC FIELD to EFFECT A MAGNETIC REPULSION of a
       physical mass encountering and entering Earth's environment.

       In my old friend Stanton Friedman's  1992  book, Crash at Corona, he
       describes the thin, paper-like metallic foil that was  found  at the
       UFO crash site  which  RESISTED  DEFORMATION.  Under the terms of my
       conceptual hypothesis, this  foil   might   have  acted  in  a  dual
       capacity, in that  it was both the outer skin of the  UFO  craft  as
       well as the  propulsion system carrying the current for the enhanced
       diamagnetic drive.

       One of the physical effects that  would  be  exhibited is a cool, or
       even VERY COLD  SURFACE,  either  due  to  an inverse  Giauque-Debye
       adiabatic demagnetization (PiezoBaric cooling), or a bizarre form of
       the Ettingshausen-Nernst effect, or even some unknown phenomenon.

       At any rate,  since the current concept of superconductivity IS that
       of a SURFACE  PHENOMENON,  I'm  not  altogether  convinced  that  an
       enhanced diamagnetic effect   is  ALSO  surface-oriented,   as   all
       indications point more  toward  a  MASS ORIENTATION (can we say mass
       current or mass polarization?).   Therefore,  assuming  that there's
       still a lot  we have to learn about physics, I'm inclined  to  leave
       the question open.

       However, what certainly would be experienced by a nearby observer to
       a functioning electro-magnetic  system  described  here  would be an
       effect of near-total DISORIENTATION,  with attendant LOSS OF TIME or
       CONSCIOUSNESS.  What it  would  do to the occupants  within  such  a
       craft without appropriate  shielding  might  be  similar, unless the
       effects are somehow negated or at  least controlled within the field
       itself.

       There have been numerous reports of near-encounters with UFOs, about
       almost all of which I tend to be skeptical.  But  there  has  been a
       certain consistency in  the  reporting  of many of these events that
       has an ominous flavor.  About the  first  thing  people  notice is a
       loss of time, usually several hours, following the event.

       This period of    apparent    unconsciousness    has    far-reaching
       implications.  Any number  of governmental agencies around the world
       would love to get their hands on such  a  device that could do these
       wonderful things to exercise control over both their  submissive and
       unruly peoples, not to mention their neighbors.

       Despite all this,  I've  never seen what might even be called a UFO,
       much less experienced any near-encounters,  but  armchair reflection
       can be a  fun thing if pieces from different puzzles  begin  to  fit
       together into an ordered and coherent picture of the cosmos.
