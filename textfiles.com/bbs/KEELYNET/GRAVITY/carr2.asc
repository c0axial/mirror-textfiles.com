                            The Saucer that didn't Fly
                                 by W. E. Du Soir

       The serious field  of  UFO's  and  flying saucer research received a
       setback at Oklahoma City in late  April  when  a  highly  publicized
       launching attempt by O.T.C. Enterprises of Baltimore,  Md., resulted
       in failure.

       Hundreds of persons  had  been  invited  to Oklahoma City by Otis T.
       Carr to watch him "launch a six-foot  prototype  model of the O.T.C.
       X-1, a space craft which works on 'utron' energy."   Those  who were
       there came away disappointed.  The flying saucer did not fly.

       The six-foot model,  well-hidden  in  a warehouse, never even got to
       the launching site, or to the amusment  park  called  Frontier City,
       where it was to have been displayed beside a 45-foot  version of the
       same X-1 which  will be an amusement "ride" in the near future.  The
       launching site was to have been a  gravel  pit  eight miles north of
       Oklahoma City where Carr claimed the saucer would rise  "400  to 600
       feet."

       Launching time was set for 3:00 PM Sunday, April 19.  Two and a half
       hours past this  time  Major  Wayne  Aho  finally announced that the
       launching had to be postponed because  of  "technical difficulties."
       Later it was stated by O.T.C. officials that one bearing housing was
       "off one-sixteenth of an inch."

       Most of the  major flying saucer clubs had ignored the  "launching".
       Except for a  story  in  early  April  there  was no advance news on
       Carr's experiment in Oklahoma City  newspapers.   One  Oklahoma City
       television reporter expressed   the   general   feeling    of    the
       townspeople, "This thing  will  never  leave the ground.  And I feel
       that a great deal of the ballyhoo they're giving out is tied in with
       the ride at Frontier City.  I have tried constantly to get in to see
       the saucer model, but they've kept it hidden."

       Equally well hidden was Carr himself.   He  was  finally  located in
       Mercy Hospital, Room 302, by John Nebel, the famed  "Long  John"  of
       WOR, New York City.

       Carr did not  show  up at a meeting at a local church the day before
       the scheduled launching but a taped  speech  was delivered to the 70
       people who attended.

       "Barring any flat tires," Carr said, "I feel that history will be

                                      Page 1





       made Sunday afternoon  when  the model of the O.T.C. X-1 is launched
       here."

       Carr did not leave his hospital room until Monday, when he was taken
       to the home of Major Aho, the man  in  charge  of  publicity for the
       company.  A scheduled  "victory"  dinner  was pretty  dismal  Sunday
       night, where again a taped message from Carr was presented.

       Monday morning at 5 AM a rumor spread that the model launching would
       again be attempted.   At  that  early  hour  a group of a half-dozen
       people, including Norman Colton,  Carr's  chief  aide,  went  to the
       warehouse.  But it was three hours later before anyone  else  showed
       up and most  of  those who had come to see the model had given up in
       disgust and left.

       Many believers in  UFO's,  although   skeptical,   had  traveled  to
       Oklahoma City to see what developed.  All of them had  left  town by
       Monday afternoon.

       One member of  a  Pennsylvania  saucer club commented, "I don't know
       what's going on but I feel they never had any intention of trying to
       launch the model.  I could not see  any plans in sight for the model
       and, in fact, I understand, that a Mr. Maywood Jones  presented only
       what he called "three-dimensional illustrations" of Carr's ideas."

       Monday afternoon there  was  more  activity  in  the  warehouse  and
       finally, around 4  PM,  the model  was  "turned  on"  and  revolved,
       althought it showed no signs of taking off from the  table  on which
       it sat.

       "We hoped to  try  to  launch  it again but unfortunately one of the
       seams burst during the test," an O.T.C. official said.

       "We still hope  to  have a launching  shortly,"  another  member  of
       Carr's group added.

       Left unanswered were such questions as:

          1)  Why  was there no publicity about the launching  in  Oklahoma
              City for two weeks before the model was supposed to fly?

          2)  Why  did  Carr  ready  a  taped  message  for delivery at the
              "victory dinner" a day before the scheduled launching?

          3)  How could any engineer make  a mistake of one-16th of an inch
              in a precision part?  This would be similar  to  a  navigator
              landing an  airplane 300 miles off course.  A mistake of one-
              10,000th of an inch can be a major engineering calamity.

       Carr was apprently  undaunted by  the  weekend's  developments.   He
       again commented, "This indeed is an historic occasion."

       Questioned about the  failures of his model, he added,  "The  theory
       itself has been  proven.   The  model  will go up, if not this week,
       then next week or next month."

       Mr. Carr also has stated that he  and  Major  Wayne Aho will "fly to
       the moon in a flying saucer on December 7, 1959."

       Vangard notes...

            As negative  as  this  article  is,  it  must  be  included  in
            conjunction with CARR1 also on KeelyNet.

            We have reason to believe that  Carr was onto a principle which
            he possibly misintepreted.  There are many correlations  for an
            apparent anti-grav  effect  which manifests itself when certain
            conditions are met.  These include  Searle,  Keely,  Tesla  and
            other observations relating to spin, frequency and geometry.

            Other files  on  KeelyNet  relate to plasmas,  acoustics,  high
            voltage and spin which you might find of use.

            For that  reason,  we  urge  you  to  not  give up on the basic
            principle which Carr said he  and  his group had proven.  It is
            possible that  faulty  engineering,  sabotage   or  suppressive
            tactics might have caused a true failure.
