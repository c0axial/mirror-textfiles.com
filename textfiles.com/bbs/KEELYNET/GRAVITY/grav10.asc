  For many years, I have studied levity (not THAT kind) stories and anecdotes
  for both organic  and  inorganic  bodies.   In all that time, this case was
  never stumbled across, until now.  And  it  needs  to  be listed because of
  it's oddity.  Imagine,  being  able to FLOAT in the air WITHOUT  equipment.
  The only problem with this fellow was that he could NOT CONTROL the effect.

                           The Man who Defied Gravity

  Between 1885 and 1890, countless thousands of people trooped cynically into
  a canvas booth  on fairgrounds in America's mid-west and invariably emerged
  convinced that they had seen the impossible.   Indeed,  it  seems as though
  they had.  What they HAD SEEN - or, at least, what they  THOUGHT  they  had
  seen - was a man floating serenely in mid-air like a gas-filled balloon.

  If Reynard Beck,  known  throughout America as "the Floating Wonder," was a
  hoaxer, he was an incredibly brilliant  one,  for  the  dozens of skeptics,
  doctors and scientists who had subjected him to EVERY KNOWN TEST, came away
  WITHOUT EXCEPTION more bemused and baffled than when they went in.

  Beck, it seemed, was a man who laughed at gravity.  To enable him to lead a
  normal earthbound life he needed a special belt hung with lead weights.  At
  night, he was lashed firmly into his bed.  On one occasion  when the straps
  came adrift, he rose up and floated gently through an open window.

  Everyone knew that  MEN  CAN'T  FLY.   The trouble was that in Beck's case,
  they just couldn't PROVE IT.

  Beck himself seemed utterly at a loss to explain his uncanny gift.  When he
  recalled the day that he began to "float," he was unable to put forward any
  sort of rational explanation.

  Years later, he wrote of his experience:  "It  was in June 1884 that I went
  to bed quite normally, not dreaming that anything was wrong.   When  I woke
  up.  I felt  remarkably fit and was anxious to get out of bed and start the
  new day.  But  I  did not land on my  feet  beside  the  bed  -  as  I  had
  anticipated.  To my  utter astonishment, I remained in mid-air  -  FLOATING
  AROUND THE ROOM."

  Petrified with fright,  he  grabbed hold of the headboard and slowly forced
  his feet down to touch the ground.

  "Then I sat down on the bed and did some  serious  thinking,  I reached for
  the mirror hanging on the wall beside the bed and examined  my  face to see
  if any radical  changes  had  occurred  to  it during the night.  But there
  didn't seem to  be  anything wrong  with  me  -  and  I  didn't  feel  ill.
  Tentatively, I stood up again and tried to walk around  the  room.   To  my
  horror, I at  once  floated into the air again and remained there as though
  suspended on hidden strings.

  "I realized that if anyone ever found out about this, I was going to be in

                                     Page 1





  big trouble.  Either  I would be regarded as a freak and carted off for all
  kinds of experiments, or people might  get  the idea that I had made a deal
  with the Devil to make myself float in mid-air!"

  He floated around towards his chest of drawers, dug out a  belt and to this
  fastened some lead  weights  he  used  for fishing.  With the belt fastened
  around his waist, he found that he could remain on the floor and move about
  normally.

  For several days,  the devastating discovery  worried  him  intensely,  but
  eventually, and perhaps inevitably, he soon got around  to  considering his
  fantastic discovery in an entirely new light.

  "Being able to  float  in the air might have all sorts of compensations.  I
  began to realize what a new world it would open up."

  Eventually, he decided to give up his job and make his fortune.  All he had
  to do was set himself up as a side-show - the people would flock to see the
  only man in the world who could FLOAT  without  artificial  aids,  and  the
  money would come rolling in!

  So Reynard Beck billed himself as "the Floating Wonder" and  became a side-
  show.  People DID  flock  to  him by the thousands - and all he did was SIT
  AND READ - but he sat FLOATING IN THE AIR while HE did so!

  His brother ran the side-show and they  began  to make big money.  But they
  did not escape without trouble.  On one occasion, spectators smashed up the
  side-show booth, believing  they  had  been  fooled,  but  were  frustrated
  because they COULD NOT DISCOVER by what trick the Floating Wonder performed
  his seemingly impossible feat!

  But Beck did not just float when on exhibition.  Friends testified that, in
  his private life,  he  found  it  impossible to keep his feet on the ground
  without help.  To enable him to walk  around  NORMALLY,  he  wore  the belt
  weighted with several  pounds  of lead.  Obviously, he couldn't  walk  long
  distances with this  added  burden,  which was not helped by the voluminous
  overcoat he wore to conceal the weights.

  When he sat  down to eat, he strapped  or  tied  himself  into  his  chair,
  otherwise he would float to about ceiling height and JUST  HANG THERE until
  someone hauled him down.

  Was it a  trick?   For  years, every known method was used in an attempt to
  expose the Floating Wonder as the fraud everyone KNEW HE MUST BE.

  One investigator wrote: "Before the exhibition,  I  thoroughly searched the
  room, looking for wires, hydraulic ramps, hidden supports  -  anything that
  might prove a  clue  to the mystery.  I found NOTHING.  While Beck sat in a
  reclining position THREE FEET from the  floor.   I  beat  the air below and
  above him with a cane but met with no resistance.  I came,  with the utmost
  reluctance, to the  conclusion  that  he  WAS  FLOATING UNSUPPORTED in thin
  air."

  After five years of touring the halls and fairgrounds - and getting rich on
  the strength of  it - Reynard Beck abruptly  announced  one  day  that  the
  uncanny gift to defy gravity had departed as suddenly as it had come.

  Certainly, he never made another public appearance.  He  returned  home  to
  the town of Dexter, in Kansas, and attempted to resume his life as an

                                     Page 2





  ordinary human being.  But it was impossible.

  "For once a  man  has  FLOWN  IN  THE AIR," he wrote with the simplicity of
  someone stumbling on a profound truth,  "he  can  never  be  quite the same
  again..."

  Vangard note

     There are  numerous  accounts of religious ecstasy producing  flight  in
     devout believers.   Spiritualist  Daniel  Home was photographed floating
     out of a 2nd story window as well  as  on  many  other  occasions  where
     people saw him levitate.  Home said the spirits lifted him up.

     In India,  at  the Sifi shrine of Qamar Ali, there are  two  very  large
     boulders that  are  routinely  levitated by visitors who touch the stone
     with their index fingers and chant  "Qamar  Ali  Dervish"  in  a certain
     chant as  instructed  by  the resident priest.  When this  happens,  the
     stone simply  levitates.   If  just  one  finger  is  removed, the stone
     crashes to the ground.  God, I want  to  DO  THIS,  videotape  and  make
     measurements.

     In the 1920's the Kowsky/Frost experiment used a quartz  crystal excited
     by microwaves.   The  crystal  expanded  and  levitated  EVEN WITH A 1.5
     kilogram weight suspended from it!

     In Homestead, Florida, Edward Leedskalnin  built  the  Coral Castle from
     native coral.  He did this single-handedly, without benefit of hoists or
     block and  tackle.  The story is that he RE-DISCOVERED  the  secret  the
     Egyptians used  to  build the pyramids.  I've been there and seen how he
     cracked the  stones  apart  with automobile  leaf  springs,  heated  up,
     inserted in a crack, then cold water poured on them  to  POP  the  stone
     apart.  As to the way of lifting and moving these very large stones, the
     word is Leedskalnin SANG to them.

     An Egyptian  painting  showed  the  use  of a vibrating wooden rod which
     caused stone to levitate when excited by a slap with this rod.

     There are numerous references such  as  'stone  floats  in  air  as iron
     floats in  water',  a reference to the Biblical levitation  of  an  iron
     axehead that  had  been  accidentally  thrown  into the water.  When the
     priest touched the water with his staff and chanted, the axehead floated
     to the surface to be retrieved.

     In various occult/metaphysical books,  mention  is  made  of  the  NAVAZ
     force, the  dark  side  of  Nature  or it's equivalent.   "Night  is  as
     pregnant as  Day",  for the seven colors of light that we see, there are
     seven 'black' colors that we cannot  see.   It  is  from  these  'black'
     colors that the wheelwork of the Universe is driven.

     There are  Fortean  stories  of  voices coming from the  sky  throughout
     recorded history  and in one case, an anchor that was caught in a church
     steeple.  This anchor was attached  to  a  rope  that  went  up into the
     clouds.  A  man  was  shimmying down the rope to release  it  as  people
     watched.  They  report  that  he  seemed to have to 'swim' to get lower.
     The witnesses grabbed him from the  rope when he got within reach and he
     appeared to be 'drowning'.  The man died.  So what gives?
