                          Spacehips that Conquer Gravity
                                by Michael Gladych

                         It will fly at the speed of light
                 making a round-trip to Venus in about 30 minutes!

       The spherical craft  squatting  on  a concrete strip emitted a faint
       hum.  A ghostly glow surrounded its  shell.   The strange craft rose
       and hovered momentarily while its landing gear retracted.   Then the
       hum increased and  the  craft  shot eastward and vanished beyond the
       horizon before the  witnessing scientists  could  click  their  stop
       watches.

       Jet-powered missle?  No. Made weightless and propelled  by its anti-
       gravity engine the  round ship was a research vehicle able to travel
       at almost the speed of light - 600,000,000 miles per HOUR.

       How soon will such a revolutionary craft take to the skies?

       Since 1953 the Canadian government's PROJECT MAGNET has been working
       on a GRAVITY-DEFYING VEHICLE powered by ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCES.

       AT LEAST 14 UNITED STATES UNIVERSITIES  AND  OTHER  RESEARCH CENTERS
       ARE HARD AT WORK CRACKING THE GRAVITY BARRIER.  Convair  on the West
       coast, Glenn L. Martin Aircraft Co. of Baltimore, MD., Bell Aircraft
       Co. of Buffalo,  NY  and  Sperry  GYROSCOPE  Co.  of Great Neck, NY.
       maintain teams of researchers and  engineers  prying  into  Nature's
       most jealously guarded secret - GRAVITY.

              "Aviation is on the threshold of amazing new concepts,"
               said the late Lawrence D. Bell, level-headed builder
               of the Bell rocket research planes.  "We are already
               working with  nuclear  fuels  and  equpment  to  CANCEL  OUT
               GRAVITY instead of fighting it."

       Even before the  famous  apple fell on Isaac Newton's head, men were
       trying to solve  the gravity problem.   But  from  the  simple  pre-
       historic lever to the most intricate modern machinery,  the  best we
       could do was to win a temporary victory.

       "What goes up  must  come down," said the biggest scientific brains,
       helpless before the mysterious gravity pull.  Newton and other great
       physicists formulated the gravity  laws,  measured  gravity pull and
       passed their findings to posterity.

       But their gravity "laws" had SEVERAL EXCEPTIONS that bothered

                                      Page 1





       inquiring minds.  Take   the   strange  behaviour  of  liquids,  for
       example.

       Move your fingertip slowly toward the surface of water and watch the
       water JUMP UP to hug your finger.   Or  put  a  soda  straw into the
       water and see the water level inside creep ABOVE the  outside  level
       in defiance of the earth's gravity pull.

       To get an  even  more  striking  contradiction  of the gravity laws,
       drape a towel  over  the edge of a  basin  half-filled  with  water.
       After a time the water will climb UP the towel and over the side.

       These and other  strange anti-gravity tricks were considered  freaks
       of MOLECULAR ATTRACTION - phenomena QUITE APART FROM GRAVITY - UNTIL
       Albert Einstein came up with his Theory of Relativity.

       Einstein said that  molecular attraction IS REALLY NO DIFFERENT from
       the gravity pull of the planets and  stars.   He theorized that this
       attraction works on the same principle as electromagnetism.

       A molecule, a planet or a star all have gravitational fields just as
       magnets or electromagnets have their magnetic fields.  To illustrate
       the similarity, Einstein  said  that  a  gravitational  field  would
       attract and bend  light  rays JUST AS A MAGNETIC FIELD BENDS CATHODE
       RAYS in your TV picture tube.

       Dr. Stanley Deser  and  Dr.  Richard   Arnowitt   of  the  Princeton
       Institute for Advanced  Study  have  recently  discovered  new  sub-
       nuclear particles of  the  atom.   Bombarded  by  powerful  electro-
       magnetic accelerators such as the  Cosmotron  and  Betatron,  atomic
       structure yielded strange particles which may be the  answer  to the
       gravitational field problem.

       "Until recently, gravitation   could   be   only  observed  but  not
       experimented on in a controlled fashion,"  Drs.  Deser  and Arnowitt
       wrote in their scientific paper.  "But the NEW PARTICLES of the atom
       which have been  linked  with  the gravitational field  can  now  be
       examined and worked with at will."

       The new discovery  means that before long we shall be able to switch
       gravity on and off as we do electricity  and  electromagnetism.  The
       next logical step is a master of engineering.

       Let's take an  ordinary  FLYWHEEL SUSPENDED ON ROLLER  BEARINGS  and
       coupled with a  POWERFUL ELECTRIC GENERATOR.  One side of that wheel
       would be "under  fire"  of  our  de-gravitational   apparatus.   The
       particles responsible for  the  gravitational  attraction  would  be
       NEUTRALIZED, a portion of the wheel would be made WEIGHTLESS.

       But once out  of  the anti-gravity field, the same part of the wheel
       would gain weight and be pulled down by earth's gravity, thus giving
       us a powerful ROTATING MOTOR.

       Another idea for  an  anti-gravity  device  comes  from  Dr.  George
       Rideout, president of the Gravity Research Foundation of New Boston,
       N.H.

              "To make  a  gravity  motor," said Dr. Rideout,  "we  need  a
               DIFFERENTIAL OF GRAVITY FORCES and the way we can get

                                      Page 2





               it is through a GRAVITY INSULATOR or ABSORBER."  To see
               how this  device  might  work,  let's turn to gravity's twin
               brother - electromagnetism.

       For years we've had trouble with watches  that  get magnetized.  You
       made a phone call or tinkered with your car's generator and presto -
       the delicate balance   wheel   of   your  watch,   exposed   to   an
       electromagnetic field, became  a  little magnet.  Now your watch was
       no longer a reliable timepiece.

       To protect a watch from magnetic influence,  we  put the inner works
       in a soft  iron casing that absorbs the magnetic force  and  shields
       the balance wheel.   In  other  words within the soft iron casing we
       have a SPACE  FREE  from the outside  magnetic  pull  -  we  have  a
       DIFFERENTIAL OF MAGNETIC FORCES.

            (..MU metal  is  a  modern  alloy  having  excellent   magnetic
             shielding properties...Vangard)

       A gravity absorber  or shield would do the same for the anti-gravity
       spaceship.  The shielded interior  would  be  free  from the earth's
       gravity attraction.  The inner structure, equipment  and  crew would
       be weightless in  relation  to  the  earth.   Thus,  we would have a
       differential of gravity forces and our ship would take off instantly
       like a super-balloon.

       For ease of calculation, suppose we  take  our G-ship to the equator
       where the rotational speed of the earth is about  1,000  mph.   With
       our anti-gravity shield  completely shut, the G-ship would be hurled
       into space just as a particle of mud shoots off a spinning tire.  We
       would scoot along a more or less  straight  line  unless we had some
       way of controlling direction and speed.

       The weightlessness of  the  G-ship  could  be easily  controlled  by
       letting some of  the  earth's  gravity  force  act  upon  the ship's
       interior.  An arrangement of shutters  like venetian blinds would do
       the trick.  To  control  our  direction,  we would need  thrust.   A
       rocket would limit  us to the amount of fuel, so let's try something
       else.

              (..sounds suspiciously like  Disney's  movie,  "Absent Minded
               Professor" who invented a gravity shielding  material termed
               FLUBBER or  more  apropo,  the "First Men in the Moon" which
               showed a material called CAVORITE, named after the scientist
               who discovered it, this  substance  was  painted  on  window
               shutters which  when rolled up did not affect  gravity,  but
               when unrolled,   acted   with   a   repellent   effect   tor
               gravity...Vangard)

       We could have an ion rocket proposed  by  Dr.  Ernst  Stuhlinger  or
       another similar nuclear  rocket  where  sub-atomic   particles   are
       accelerated by a  powerful  electromagnetic  gun  and  ejected  into
       space.  We could also utilize ELECTROMAGNETIC REPULSION.

       We know that two LIKE MAGNETIC POLES REPEL EACH OTHER, just as under
       certain conditions an electromagnetic  field  REPELS  THE  SO-CALLED
       DIAMAGNETIC METALS.  Take a flat aluminum ring, put it over a strong
       electromagnet and switch on the current.  The disk  will fly off the
       solenoid with quite a speed.

                                      Page 3





       Starting with this  principle  of  DIAMAGNETIC REPULSION, a group of
       Canadian scientists of  Project   Magnet  proposes  to  harness  the
       magnetic fields of  the  earth  and  other  celestial   bodies   for
       propulsion of the G-ship.

       The earth's magnetic  field  is TOO WEAK TO REPEL or PROPEL a G-ship
       made of ORDINARY METAL.  However,  current  studies in the nature of
       magnetism point to a possible solution.  Scientists believe that the
       answer lies in THE STRUCTURE OF ATOMS.

       By RE-ARRANGING THE ATOMIC STRUCTURE we could GREATLY  INCREASE  THE
       DIAMAGNETIC PROPERTIES of  the  G-ship  and make it travel along the
       magnetic lines of force like the  aluminum  ring  shooting  off  the
       solenoid.

       According to Einstein's   theories,  there  is   no   end   to   the
       electromagnetic and gravitational fields of the planets and stars.

       Those fields INTERTWINE  in a MOST COMPLEX PATTERN but THEY ARE EVER
       PRESENT.  Proper selection of the fields and the controlled exposure
       to their forces would let us navigate our G-ship in space as well as
       within the earth's  boundaries.   And  the  use  of  electromagnetic
       propulsion would eliminate the problem of fuel.

       Now, let's take a closer look at the G-ship.  Its spherical shape is
       dictated by the internal pressurization necessary for  high altitude
       and space travel.   From  the  viewpoint of engineering, a sphere is
       ideal for coping with the pressure differential.  Also, it gives the
       maximum volume for its dimensions.   An  interior artificial gravity
       ring would solve the problems of living in a weightless void.

       The anti-gravity shield  would  completely  conceal   the  crew  and
       passenger compartment.  This  would  eliminate  visual  observation.
       However, even our present radar and TV would give the crew excellent
       electronic vision.

       Apart from the cabin, there would  be  an  engine room for the anti-
       gravity motor and  the  auxiliary  power  to  run   the   electronic
       apparatus.  Since the   ship   would   take  off  and  land  in  the
       atmosphere, there would  be two problems  to  overcome  -  the  heat
       caused by air friction and the question of air drag of the spherical
       shape.

       To take the  singe  out  of  the friction heat, Canadian  scientists
       headed by Wilbur  B. Smith contemplate an ingenious ELECTRO-MAGNETIC
       device.  Switched on before takeoff,  the  device  would attract and
       hold fast a large portion of air around the ship.

       This captured "boundary   cushion"   would  move  with   the   ship.
       Therefore the air  friction  would take place at a distance from the
       ship's structure and the heat would  be  dissipated  before it could
       warm up the  ship's anti-gravity shield.  The mass  of  captive  air
       would be shaped  into  the  most  advantageous  aerodynamic form.  A
       tear-drop for moderate speeds, a sharp-ended spindle for supersonics
       and a concave, cup-like shape for aiding deceleration for landing.

       Even for space travel, the stores  and  provisions  would  be small.
       Once OUTSIDE the earth's atmosphere, the G-ship would  be capable of
       traveling at near the speed of light - roughly 600,000,000 miles per
       hour.
                                      Page 4





       At that speed,  a  322,000,000  mile  round-trip to Venue would TAKE
       ABOUT 30 MINUTES!

       Make no mistake  about  it,  anti-gravity  motors  and  G-ships  are
       coming.  Remember, a  year before the Wright brothers  took  off  at
       Kitty Hawk some  of our top scientists "proved" that a heavier-than-
       air craft could not possibly fly.

       And in 1935  the  British Air Ministry  nixed  Frank  Whittle's  jet
       engine as "interesting but not practical."

       But the best answer to the disbelievers is that some  of these anti-
       gravity ideas are already on the drawing boards of the United States
       aircraft industry.  With  their  brain power and technological know-
       how, our engineers will soon send  Newton's  apple  back up where it
       came from!
