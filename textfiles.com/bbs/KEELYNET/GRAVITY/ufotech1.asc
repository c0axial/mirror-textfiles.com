         This is  the  kind of file dealing with UFO's that REALLY helps in
          finding correlations between the  many  cases  that yield so very
                             little tangible evidence.

        I am very impressed with Terry's extrapolation of  information from
        multiple sources with particular emphasis on the physical effects.

          Please use  this  file  as an example of what we look for here at

       TO:ALL
       FROM:Terry Bastian

       This file was created to aid in the comparison of UFO sightings.
       These do not represent all the reports  and  sightings there are but
       are of the  older kinds (Time Period 1950-1965 and  others).   These
       are the technical  abstracts,  not the personal-emotional experences
       of the contacts.  Since these sightings technology has developed new
       ideas and inventions such as:

                    Transparent metalic aluminum,
                    Lensless telescopes,
                    Magnetohydrodynamics,
                    Subatomic particle vacume (A.K.A. Etheric medium),
                    Ionised plasma physics,
                    And much more............................

       It seems that all that may be missing is a suitable power source!!!!

       Materials of which the air boats  were  constructed  either  wood or
       metal.  Injection of  a  substance  into the wood did  not  increase
       weight but did  give  it a leather-like toughness.  The metal was an
       alloy of two  white  and  one red colored  metals  possibly  copper,
       magnesium, and aluminum.  The surface covering appeared  smooth with
       no seams and also had a luminous look to it.


                                      Page 1





       A strong heavy metal chest was in the center of the boat and was the
       generator.  The force  was directed by 2 large flexible tubes to the
       fore and aft along with 8 smaller bulwark tubes with double openings
       pointing up and down.  Directing the  force  thru the tubes was done
       by opening and closing the valves in each tube.

       They were propelled  by  air and inside is placed a  mercury  engine
       with an iron  heating  apparatus  beneath.   By  means  of the power
       latent in the mercury sets the driving  whirlwind in motion. When it
       has been heated  by the controlled fire from the iron  containers  a
       thunder power is  developed through the mercury.  If the iron engine
       with the properly wielded joints  be  filled  with  mercury and fire
       conducted into the upper part, it develops the power  with  the roar
       of the lion.  Fire may not be literal but as an electrical type.

       A form of jet drive is a very small "disc" ray plays on a stream of
       fuel in a  closed chamber which disintegrates it.  Fuel is air which
       is collected and compressed, another fuel could also be a metal.

       Primary drive is when the control system is placed in synchronous
       frequency with universal energy flows but just slightly out of phase
       with them.  Either lagging or leading which determines the direction
       with or against the flow.  The speed  of  travel  depending  on  the
       amount of phase shift that is applied.

       A power has  been over looked it is the same power  that  turns  the
       planet around the  sun, the sun around the galaxy, even the electron
       around its nucleus.

                          CHURCHWARD'S TECHNICAL COMMENTS
                                     (ANCIENT)

       The power (energy?) is taken from the atmosphere in a very simple
       manner.  The engine is similar to  a modern turbine in that it works
       from one chamber to another until exhausted.  Once  started it would
       never stop until  the bearings worn out or turned off.  The power is
       unlimited or rather limited by what  the  metals  will  stand.   The
       ships propel themselves generating their own power as they fly along
       independent of fuel.

                            DRAKE'S TECHNICAL COMMENTS
                                     (ANCIENT)

       The aerial cars  are made of light wood with a durable  well  formed
       body having mercury  inside  and  fire at the bottom.  Iron, copper,
       lead and other metals are used for  these machines.  Metals suitable
       are light and heat absorbing are of 16 kinds.  They  were  propelled
       by the etheric  force  generated in a strong heavy metal chest which
       when opened caused dire affliction  suggesting  lethal vibrations or
       radioactivity.

                           ADAMSKI'S TECHNICAL COMMENTS

       A giant silvery cigar shaped ship hung motionless with no wings or
       appendages of any kind, a orange glow was noticed  on  the  top half
       along the entire length.  A heavy glass bell shape ship colorful and
       translucent in appearance.
                                      Page 2





       Three ball shaped  landing  gear  were half lowered below the flange
       that covered them.  On top was a  round  glowing  ball  like a heavy
       lens.  Top of craft was domed shaped, with a ring of  gears or heavy
       coil glowing at  the  base of the dome.  Round portholes in the side
       wall but not above the position of the ball gear.  The lower outside
       portion or flange was shiny but not  one  piece built in layers in a
       reverse step fashion.   Underneath  the craft two  rings  under  the
       flange and a  third  around  the  center  disk.  The inner and outer
       rings appeared to  revolve clockwise  and  the  middle  one  counter
       clockwise in direction looking up from underneath.

       Inside a slight hum came from the floor and a coil  built at the top
       of the circular  wall.  The coil glowed red but emitted no heat, the
       coil emitted various colors before like a flashing prism.

       Many of the color changes and glowing coronas are from different
       energy intensities radiating  into   the   atmosphere   similar   to
       ionization.

       A pillar about 2 feet thick extended downward from  the  top  of the
       dome thru the  center  of  the floor.  This is a reversible magnetic
       pole to draw on natures forces to provide power for flight.  It also
       serves as a powerful telescope one end to the sky and one end to the
       ground and are projected to the big lenses on the floor and ceiling.

       Control panels and benches are placed  along  the  outer  wall.   An
       instrument connected to the central column and functions  similar to
       a periscope.

       Four cables appear to run thru the floor lens or below it join the
       central column forming  a  cross.   Three  cables carry power to the
       ball underneath which are hollow  and  can  be lowered for emergency
       landings are used as electro-static condensers.  The  4th cable goes
       from the column  to 2 periscopic instruments, one next to the pilots
       seat and the other behind him.

       All the machinery is locate underneath the floor and under the outer
       flange.  Small workshop and storage  areas  are  located here, along
       with the ships environmental system.

       A porthole opened in the wall somewhat like an iris of a camera to a
       size of about  18  inches, the porthole is nearly undetectable  when
       closed.

       Craft recharge is  done  by  connecting  a  clamp to the edge of the
       flange and the other end of the cable to a charging rail.  Emergency
       recharge can be done in flight by  receiving  a beam of power from a
       transmitting source.  The hulls of the craft are multi-layered.   By
       increasing the frequency of the activated area of a ship can produce
       invisibility.

       Nature works on the principal that 1 plus 1 equals 3.  The positive
       and negative brought  together in a relationship that results in the
       third which in  itself has a percentage  of  the  other  two  primal
       forces.  If we  liken  the  earths  geomagnetic  field  as  circular
       ripples like dropping  a pebble into a pond they expand and diminish
       in force.  If we drop 2 pebbles  in  the  pond  several  feet apart,
       where the ripples  meet  they  form  an  interference  pattern  that
       extends between the 2 points.  The pattern assumes the shape of an

                                      Page 3





       extended ellipse with  the  smaller  ends at the 2 points.  Although
       the ripples have diminished the interference  pattern has combined a
       portion of both forces to create a third force that remains constant
       between the 2 points as long as they are active.

       The elliptical magnetic  interference  fields  maintain  a  constant
       strength between the  celestial  bodies.  The planets magnetic field
       can be described as direct current  while  the  interference pattern
       can be called alternating current and can be transmitted  over  long
       distances.

       They exist in the solar systems as well as the atoms.  The end zones
       of the elliptical  fields  influence  the  earth  from +/-58 degrees
       latitude and the axis of the pattern  is  equivalent  to  the earths
       magnetic equator.

       The ships operate on electro-static power finding the balance of
       centrifugal force of  a planets axial velocity and  the  centripetal
       attraction of the  planets  electrostatic  field.   The crafts field
       would be adjusted to resonate and  blend with the geomagnetic field.
       The power is  produced  by a generator similar to  a  Van  de  Graff
       electro-static generators and a type of magnetic turbine.

       The ship has  been  described  as  glowing  which  is  created  when
       particles come into contact with  the  resonant  field.   Pulsations
       within this field cause a shimmering effect which  makes  the  craft
       appear alive and  breathing.   This also can cause the light to bend
       completely around the craft and to  become invisible.  Also as field
       strength is varied  ionization  may  shift thru all  colors  of  the
       spectrum to a part of the spectrum not visible.

       The intense resonating  field  also  serves  as  a shield to deflect
       debris from the ship.  And at the  same  time serve as a atmospheric
       buffer reducing friction and atmospheric shockwaves.

       The external field of the ship can cause the local  air  to condense
       and form a cloud around the hovering ship.

       To travel at FTL speeds the ships field is tuned to a high resonant
       point or a  prime merge.  The three ball undercarrage seen serves as
       a retractable landing gear and as a 3 point electrostatic propulsion
       control system.  The larger ships  use  a series of bands built into
       the framework for the same purpose.  The variable  3  point  systems
       maneuver by regulating the charge on them.

       The walls are  of  multiple  construction  for  safety  and  storage
       purposes There must be a minimum  of  2  charged  walls,  the  outer
       negative and the inner positive.  The field outside  the  ship  will
       negatively ionize all  particles of matter near the ship.  The power
       field emanating from the ship can blurr photographic negatives as if
       they were exposed to X-rays.  The  greater  amount of power used the
       farther the influence  extending  from  the  ship.    The   positive
       reference field on  the inner wall leaves the central portion of the
       ship at a neutral potential.

                            MENGER'S TECHNICAL COMMENTS

       In a ship unlike anything you have dreamed of.  The force is a

                                      Page 4





       electromagnetic one not  unlike  the force that holds planets, suns,
       and even entire galaxies in their  orbits.   This force is a natural
       law which has been given to us to be used for good  purposes.   Your
       scientists have discovered  this  but  do not know how to apply this
       force.  Until we can use this force  for good we will not be able to
       understand this power.

       The small craft that we use for observation and reconnaissance will
       nullify or make neutral anything electrical such as  the  electrical
       system of a  car,  radio, television, and the like.  The power could
       kill a man instantly or over a period  of time depending on how high
       the power level is.  The cause of this danger is an  electromagnetic
       flux or field  revolving  around  the craft and the rate of speed of
       the flux is the determining factor in the amount of damage done.

       The energy would disrupt the cellular  and  atomic  balances  in the
       body and the  damage to human tissue might lead to certain  diseases
       such as cancer  of  the  blood,  liver  malfunction,  or other organ
       disorder.  This power  properly  controlled  could  also  cure  many
       sickness by restoring the natural balance in the body.

       I noticed one  of  three  ball like objects under the  craft  became
       distorted and looked  like  rubber as it seemed to stretch and grasp
       the ground.  I  could  see the other  two  through  the  translucent
       flange.  The ships often appear to change shape and  colors  due  to
       the shifting magnetic fields surrounding them.

       Photos taken around   the   craft   may  be  distorted  due  to  the
       electromagnetic flux around the craft.   Tape  recorders  would  not
       work aboard the craft all that would be heard is a hiss on the tape.

       Approximately one third of the circular interior room was devoted to
       instrument panels and in front of the panels was a  frame containing
       some sort of viewing screen.

       Take the primary energy from electrons present in our atmosphere and
       channel the force  which  surrounds  each electron into all types of
       simpler conveniences which cost nothing  to  operate utilizing so to
       speak a free energy. Do not destroy the electrons but take the power
       which surrounds each  one  of  them  using the power  and  then  the
       released electrons go on their way recharge and become useful again.

       Material obstructions in  space  if  on  a collision course with the
       ship the flux around the hull would  repel  it  and  veer off to the
       side.

       Using a 24 inch plywood base I drilled a hole half way thru the
       center.  In the  hole I securely placed a carbon  rod  of  a  broken
       flashlight cell.

       Next I obtained  a  large  nail  of like diameter and wound the nail
       with 50 turns of very fine copper  wire.   I  slid the finished coil
       off the nail the unwound ends of wire were about 8-10 inches long.

       I soldered 2  extra connections one from the top and  one  from  the
       bottom: 2 of the ends were connected to a small penlight battery.  I
       stapled some of  the  wires to the wood base to hold the assembly in
       position.


                                      Page 5





       Next I took  the  brass cap off a larger flashlight battery cell and
       glued it to the exact center of a  10  inch  aluminum disc which was
       then placed in a balanced position on top of the carbon rod.

       The four ends of the wire pointed at the edge of the  disc  directly
       opposite to each other to form a cross approximately 1/8 of an inch
       from the disc  edges.   All  was  set up in the imaginary shape of a
       pyramid.  I made 2 connections at  the bottom of the apparatus which
       apparently completed the circuit.

       The disc immediately was enveloped in a bluish spinning  light  then
       it rose from the platform went thru my 12 foot ceiling and back down
       again destroying that  model.  Did the electrons which came from the
       small battery start a reaction in  the  atmosphere  which  took over
       once the system was primed. Later the experiment was  duplicated  to
       the extent that the disc glowed but never did it move.

                          KRASPEDON'S TECHNICAL COMMENTS

       We use the natural atmospheric pressure to give us the necessary
       propulsive force in  our ships.  If we maintain a pressure below the
       craft and bring about a decompression on top the craft will be given
       a terrific upward thrust which no  known force can match.  We create
       a vacuum in the direction of travel.  If we have low pressure on one
       side the other side is subject to full atmospheric  pressure and any
       object can be  moved  when  this difference in potential is created.
       The ship can move at any speed and  without creating any friction in
       the atmosphere.  Maneuvering is done by shifting the location of the
       vacuum.  The ship  could be constructed of any material  and  almost
       any shape due  to  the  lack  of  friction in the atmosphere.  Glass
       windows would not be put in due to  the  pressure  differences  that
       would break them but a form of television viewing can  be  used.  We
       often require heating  inside  the craft due to the vacuum causing a
       drop in temperature.

       Cathode rays have the strange property of decomposing the atmosphere
       in which they  pass.   Under  this   action   the  elements  of  the
       atmosphere decompose and  ionize.   In  addition  to  this  we  make
       cathode rays intersect the anode rays at an angle of 45 degrees.  We
       achieve this by  using  high voltage and current.  The entire rim or
       outer edge of the craft acts as the cathode ray emitter.  These rays
       are deadly and  are  only projected  outwards  and  are  capable  of
       destroying human cells and in causing lethal burns.

       The colorations of the craft are caused by these rays.  They are the
       result of the  low  pressure  that is created.  The intensity of the
       vacuum is proportional  to  the   amount  of  current  used  and  is
       controlled by a  rheostat.   The  passage  of  high speed  electrons
       through the dense  air  appeared  to open up a tunnel giving rise to
       strong ionization of the particles  with considerable air turbulence
       and luminous effects which varied according to the voltage used.

       It was found that heavy ions cause low pressure and  that  electrons
       could break down  the  atmosphere and set free hydrogen which became
       ionized and repelled by like charge.   The vacuum creating effect is
       not strictly due  to  the  intrinsic speed of the ions  but  to  the
       atmospheres ability to  absorb ionized particles.  The negative ions
       are absorbed by the air and the positive  ones  move to the negative
       charged surface of the ship.
                                      Page 6





       The area around  the ship never reaches saturation point because the
       ionized bubble surrounding the ship is attracted and absorbed by the
       surrounding atmosphere with tremendous force and in its place only a
       vacuum is left.  One way to shape  and  manipulate  the vacuum is to
       use the effect  that  ions  and  electrons  can be  deflected  by  a
       magnetic force.

       The earths magnetic field is made up of the electric fluid of the
       planet. If we  manufacture  an electric fluid which differs from the
       terrestrial etheric envelope the  magnetic  field  of  the  earth no
       longer affects us and enjoy complete freedom of movement.   When you
       entered our craft  I  called your attention to the different kind of
       light inside which did not emanate  from  any  particular  piece  of
       machinery but was caused by the air itself being luminous.

       You also felt a being of lightness and well being.  At this time you
       were in an artificial etheric atmosphere and not the ordinary earths
       atmosphere.  When you're   accustomed  to  the  earths   ether   the
       artificial ether appears    luminous.     If   we   were   to   send
       electromagnetic pulses between magnets the waves thus produced would
       create an ether different from that  on  earth.   A variation in the
       distance between the plates would bring about a modification  in the
       ether produced.

                             DIBITONTO'S TECHNICAL COMMENTS

       It looked like  a  large  silver  plate  in places like molten glass
       mixed with molten tin.  Around it  were  lights  of different colors
       and underneath were 3 large spheres.  On the upper  part was a large
       dome and on  its  highest  point  burned a dazzling white light that
       illuminated the disc and the surroundings.

       The dome had small round windows from which a similar light shone as
       if the interior was illuminated  from  all  directions.   The  light
       which surrounded the  disc  suddenly  changed color  from  white  to
       violet then to a deep orange.  There was a flash the disk becoming a
       ball of light I could hear a slight humming sound.  Then all at once
       it sped away  and  over  the  trees  a  mist  was  left behind which
       gradually dissolved.

       A light appeared which grew brighter and brighter.  The outline of a
       large cigar-shaped object resting  on  the  ground  could be clearly
       seen.  I was over 100 meters long and at its thickest reached to the
       height of the  trees  behind  it.   A long row of portholes  emitted
       colored lights that  lit up the area where it was resting.  From one
       end of the ship one after another  4 discs that shone so brightly as
       to appear as globes of white light.  After a time the discs returned
       and a humming  sound could be heard from the huge  craft  the  light
       around it grew  stronger  changing  from  pearl white to orange gold
       along its length.   Then  it  lifted   skyward   streaked  off  like
       lightning and disappeared from sight.

       As soon as  a starship lands on earth it is fully materialized.   It
       remains enveloped in cosmic power which makes it independent of the
       gravitational forces of the planet.  For this reason we can lift off
       the earth with ease at the ideal velocity for dematerialization.

       When we raise the frequency of our life vibration we find ourselves

       perfectly attuned to the life of other dimensions.  We can ascend to
       the heavens of  higher  dimensions  or  descend to lower even to the
       material.

       The disc shaped  craft could be  seen  resting  on  the  ground  and
       reflected the colors of the sky from the surface of  the  round dome
       which appeared to  be  a  crystalline  meld  of metal and glass; the
       gleam of reflection was such that one might expect it to burst forth
       with light at any moment.

       Seen from so close the disc surface  seemed  to  pulsate with a soft
       glow The inside  was  simple  but  elegant.   The central  room  was
       illuminated with light that seemed to come from all directions as no
       source was seen.   Under  the  large  dome four panels with built in
       charts served as walls.  One of the panels had many brightly colored
       lines on it and sparkled with rapidly changing patterns of lights.

                          ALLINGHAM'S TECHNICAL COMMENTS

       It was a solid metallic thing with a dome portholes and three bumps
       underneath.  In the center the underneath was darker and shaped like
       a cone.  At first 3 portholes were  visible but then it turned and I
       saw some more.  There was what looked like a hatch  on  top  of  the
       dome and it seemed translucent.

       It glinted in  the  sunlight  and  looked  as if made of metal.  The
       upper dome and spherical landing gear  were clearly seen.  I heard a
       low humming sound as it came within a few hundred yards from me.

       The whole metallic body seemed to glow faintly as it  hovered  for a
       moment then it  landed  with a soft thud.  The hull central wall and
       upper dome seemed to be shaped from  one  sheet of metal.  Its color
       and lustre were  not  unlike  a  polished aluminum.   There  were  2
       visible groups of  portholes  set  in threes around the central wall
       and above was a small flange.

       From the top of the dome a dark vertical  rod projected which looked
       like a lightning   rod.    The  hull  didn't  seem  transparent   or
       translucent and I  thought  to  touch it.  I tapped the hull quickly
       expecting to get a shock and received none.  It seems that the motor
       was not running.

       The hull did feel warm to the touch.   The humming noise began again
       barely louder than the buzz of a fly.  It lifted  into  the  air the
       upper dome seeming  to  revolve  swiftly  but silently and the craft
       glided into the heavens.

                          VAN TASSEL'S TECHNICAL COMMENTS

       The ship is self luminous you don need to use flash bulbs to take
       pictures of a ship at night.  The  ships  seem  to spin they do not.
       The emanations of  spiral  radiation  from  the  ships   give   this
       illusion.  The upper  or  positive  polarity  of  the craft radiates
       emanations outwardly from  the center  due  to  the  collection  and
       concentration of light  particles  through a vortex  funnel  in  the
       center of the craft.


                                      Page 8





       These light emanations  radiating  outward appear such as grooves on
       one of your  phonograph  records.    The   lower  negative  polarity
       operates in reverse.  This light substance emanation is contained in
       a field or zero circumference which is void and gives the impression
       of an egg.

                             FRY'S TECHNICAL COMMENTS

       A moving electron creates a magnetic field.  The tremendous surge of
       electrons through the  force rings produces a very  strong  magnetic
       field.  The direction  and  amplitude  of flow is controlled through
       either ring and in several paths in  a  single ring we can produce a
       field which oscillates in a pattern of precise controlled modes.

       In this way  a  magnetic resonance can be created  between  the  two
       rings or between  several  segments  of a single ring.  Any changing
       magnetic field will create a electric field which at any instant
       is equal in amplitude opposite in  sign  and  perpendicular  to  the
       magnetic field.

       If the two fields become mutually resonant a vector force will be
       generated.  The force is similar to a gravitational  field.   If the
       center of the  field coincides with the crafts center of gravity the
       effect will be  to increase the inertia  or  apparent  mass  of  the
       craft.  If the fields center doesn't reside at the  crafts center of
       gravity the craft will begin to accelerate toward that center.

                            ROHRER'S TECHNICAL COMMENTS

       The cabins were  pressured  with  30  percent  oxygen  mixed with 70
       percent helium and the crafts were powered by electrostatic turbines
       for propulsion while the magnetic  fields  created  by  the rotating
       rings of the craft themselves.

                           SCHIRMER'S TECHNICAL COMMENTS

       The ship   is   operated  through  reversible  electromagnetism.   A
       crystalline rotor in the ships center is linked to two large columns
       these being the  reactors.  Reversing magnetic and electrical energy
       allows control over matter and gravity.   A  radar  beam can disrupt
       the craft through the ionization caused by the beam.   In  some  way
       power can be  drawn  from  electrical lines and also from water into
       the ships.

       The ships are made of an extremely  pure  100% magnesium.  A reddish
       orange light emanates from the underside as a humming  noise and the
       ship begin to rise and shoot into the sky.

                            KLARER'S TECHNICAL COMMENTS

       The craft was made of silvery white material like glass or porcelain
       and grey in the shadows flashing like a mirror in the sunlight.  The
       dome large and  rounded  with  three  sets  of four portholes in the
       circular hull and below this a flat  bottom  resting  on three short
       legs almost hidden in the grass.

                                      Page 9





       The craft uses  a  combination  of  field differentials to move thru
       space as a natural celestial object  taking  their  environment with
       them.  The electrostatic  shield  protects  the people  within  from
       dangerous radiations from without.

                           SHERWOOD'S TECHNICAL COMMENTS

       There are 3 large turn electromagnetic coils.  Close examination
       reveals a doubling  or displacement at periodic intervals suggesting
       a pulsating slowly turning wave  form.   There  are  highly  charged
       electrostatic condensers which   double   as  landing   gear.    The
       condensers pulse in sequence and a rotating field is produced.

                             HILL'S TECHNICAL COMMENT

       The craft was surrounded in a fiery rotating mass of some kind, you
       could see the  craft  in the center of it.  It then lifted up dipped
       down and then went straight up into the sky.

                           ANDERSON'S TECHNICAL COMMENTS

       There apparently hovering a few inches above the ground was a large
       shinning disc.  The diameter was about  sixty  feet and about twenty
       five to thirty  feet high.  Five windows or portholes  were  visible
       and it glowed  all  over  with  a dull fluorescent light.  A sort of
       halo seemed to surround the craft.   It  appeared  to hover 18 to 20
       inches off the ground.  We began to hear a slight humming sound like
       a generator running.  A low droning pulsating hum.

       The dim glow  surrounding the craft took on an orange  cast  then  a
       bright red color.   It glowed like a huge ball of red fire.  It rose
       up and changed to a brilliant bluish  white  and  sailed  off to the
       horizon.

       The blue white light turned to a dull green and made no sound.  It
       slowly started to descend.  We could make out what  appeared  to  be
       three large round  like  ball  objects equally spaced in thirds near
       the outer rim of the ship from which  the  fluorescent glowing light
       appeared to emanate.  The ship appeared to bounce up and down and we
       could hear the pulsating hum increase and decrease  as  it  bounced.
       The dull fluorescent  glow  around the rim brightened to a brilliant
       white then it disappeared from its location.

                             ?????? TECHNICAL COMMENTS

       The ships do not carry walls of lead  many  feet  thick.  In reality
       the ship hulls are not much more than many layers of  skins somewhat
       like plywood but  of  a plastic crystal substance (aluminum silicate
       crystal????) which can be opaque and  transparent to light depending
       on the field magnetism applied.

       The hulls will tend to reflect light in a star formation (similar to
       a star sapphire).   Alternating  layers are positively  ionized  and
       others negative.  These  are  insulated from each other with neutral
       layers between them.  The approaching cosmic radiation is rendered

                                      Page 10





       unstable by the  field  magnetism  constantly  maintained around the
       ship.

       Upon reaching the hull of the ship  they  are  shattered.   Then the
       respective charges are  absorbed  by  the  many  layers.    Thus  no
       radiation should penetrate   inside.    When   electric   force   is
       discharged under normal conditions, a flame, or darting lightning is
       visible all around the disk.  Thus  we  see  flames of all different
       colors dependent on the gas content of the atmosphere.

       The field surrounding the ship acts on every atom  and  molecule  in
       the ship force and acceleration is vectored in the same direction at
       the same time.   All  gravitational  and  acceleration  effects from
       inertia are neutralized or nonexistent.
