                 Hydrostatic Space-Time and Gravitational Monitors
                          Monitoring Space/Time Stresses
                                 by J.G. Gallimore

       The sun has  been  proven to bend light and magnetic lines of force.
       The hypothetical "black  hole" is  thought  to  bend  space  itself.
       Space is considered a fabric composed of lines of force  which  like
       light, can be  bent,  or  interferred with.  The space fabric is NOT
       MATTER, but encloses all matter like water around a fish in the sea.

       The measurment of the stress of space  is  very  much like measuring
       currents of water.   We  can use existing currents,  or,  as  herein
       contained, CREATE CURRENTS IN SPACE BY FORCE.

       The primary location  of  a  stress  current is thought to be AROUND
       MASS.  Any mass should create by  it's  weight,  a  STRAIN  IN SPACE
       which creates curvature of the space/time fabric PROPORTIONAL TO THE
       MASS ATTRACTION.

       The question of  measurement  by  lineage,  time,  mass  weight,  or
       distance can be  ruled  out  because  the  objects or tools used for
       measurement WILL THEMSELVES CHANGE in DIMENSIONS proportional to the
       space curvature.  An  iron  bar  on  a  space  ship  traveling  many
       thousands of miles an hour will have it's LENGTH change.

       The measurement aboard the spaceship will have also changed the same
       amount, so the iron bar APPEARS to retain the same  length.   Only a
       remote observer out  of  the  actual  affect  of the phenomena could
       measure the foreshortening  effect,   providing  the  long-distance,
       elaborate equipment was developed and available.

       However, we are fortunate that stresses in and around matter produce
       phenomena in a localized area of space, which means  an observer and
       his measurement equipment   could   exist   outside  the  sphere  of
       influence.

       As an example,  a Russian researcher  (Kozyrev)  discovered  that  a
       rubber band (matter) "stressed" (pulled apart) created  a  stress in
       the space/time fabric  that  would  displace  a  sensitive  pendulum
       (local mass) sideways.  A SMALL ROTATION  TORQUE WAS ALSO NOTED, but
       the sensitive equipment needed to be very close to the area of space
       stressed (within 40 feet).


                                      Page 1





       While the torque and displacement of the pendulum could be measured,
       the fabric of  space  could  not,  only it's affects.  His discovery
       that stress in mass EMITTED or CREATED localized space/time stresses
       provided incentive for more research around the world.

       The simplified phenomena of space  stresses  as shown by Kozyrev can
       be detailed as follows :

           1)  A "rubber band" when stressed created a time/space stress.
               a.  All mass stress will create a time/space stress.

           2)  A  suspended  mass  in  the  localized  area  of  time/space
               stresses was affected as an affect of stress curvature.
               a.  A   displacement  (angle)  and  a  rotation  torque  was
                   imparted to a suspended  mass  in  a  localized  area to
                   time/space stresses.

       The following experiments were conducted (by Gallimore  Labs)  using
       these general parameters :

           A.  Comparison of dielectrics (rubber band) with equal mass non-
               dielectric for stress potential (emission).

           B.  Comparison of crystalline mass with non-crystalline mass for
               stress potential (emission).

           C.  Comparison  of  crystal  lattice  structure  mass  with non-
               organized lattice structure (emission).

       The above were  tested for emission  and  absorption  of  space/time
       stresses.  Conclusions:

           the dielectric  (glass,  water, etc.), as opposed  to  the  non-
           dielectric( (metals)  were  found TO ABSORB and EMIT more stress
           energy.

       The crystalline mass absorbed and  emitted  more  stress energy than
       the non-crystalline.  The   organized   crystal  lattice   structure
       achieved maximum results in storage and emission.

       It was at this point in my (Gallimore Labs) research that electrical
       stresses in matter   were  examined  for  emission  and  absorption.
       Electrical stresses PRODUCED GREAT EMISSIONS of time/space currents,
       evidence was found on absorption  that  "areas  of  least electrical
       charge absorbed the  greatest  amount"  (interior  of  tube,  hollow
       solid, etc.).

       While information on  the physical parameters of space/time stresses
       and their abnormalities was achieved,  the  lack  of  an  electrical
       monitor began to be felt often in the lab.

       Like the foreshortening  of  the iron bar, the electrical  phenomena
       was of a  self-compensating  nature.   The variables associated with
       known theory prevented an active stress  monitor  from being proven.
       The limitations were  such  that  ONLY  A PASSIVE MONITOR  would  be
       accepted in theory (something acted on WITHOUT ITSELF ACTING).

       The passive monitor grew out of the discovery that a high dielectric


                                      Page 2





       with an organized  lattice structure absorbed normal earth stresses,
       and was in constant emission of same through the C-axis.

       The emission off   the  C-axis  was   eventually   detected   by   a
       passive/active monitor; a  dielectric  with  AN  IMPOSED  electrical
       charge on each  side of it by electrical plates (i.e. a capacitor by
       measuring leakage curves).

       Test design setup :

           A two pound optical grade quartz  crystal  was  placed with it's
           natural pointed  end  (C-axis)  pointed at, and  almost  in  (90
           degree) contact with a 15V - 15 microfarad capacitor.

           A one  volt,  100  milliamp  regulated direct current charge was
           imposed on the capacitor PRIOR to the source crystal contact.

           The electrical DC charge was used to define the normal capacitor
           curves, then the current charge  was  switched  off a calibrated
           waiting time (strain curve).

           The source crystal was then placed in contact for  four minutes,
           and then removed.

           The capacitor was again switched on electrically and the current
           absorption curve noted.

           The result  was  the  capacitor  curve  changed,  for  that test
           duration and the next seven tests as well.

           The stress  energy  absorbed   in   the   capacitor   dielectric
           (internal) produced effects LASTING 34 MINUTES.

       A computer analysis which was done afterwards showed  the  capacitor
       had CHANGED it's  electrical  value of capacitance.  It also changed
       from a PARABOLIC curve of current absorption to a CUBIC curve.

       The dielectric between the metal plates had temporarily changed it's
       dielectric constant upwards to a higher  constant.   The capacitance
       value increased accordingly.   The metallic plates were  unaffected.
       The computer verified  the test curves, as ALTERED, NOT ERRORS.  The
       test is acceptable to physics and  mathematics  in  that the test is
       REPEATABLE, and the results defined and predictable once known.

       Vangard Notes...

           This fascinating  paper  is  a result of massive  investigations
           carried out  by  Jerry  Gallimore  into the phenomena of various
           energies.  Jerry had the unique  ability  to see patterns across
           vast bodies  of  information  which  helped  him   to  determine
           universal principles applicable to both energy and mass.

           In the  last  few  years  of  his life, we kept in touch through
           occasional phone calls.  Jerry  said  that  if  we established a
           fixed building  he would donate ALL his research  notes,  papers
           and equipment  to  help others carry on the effort.  We have yet
           to setup a research/library  facility  though  we  are  actively
           working on it this year.

           The purpose  of  this comment is an interesting field of thought
           still not accepted by "formal"  science,  that is the concept of
           PUSH GRAVITY as outlined in the file WRIGHT1.ASC on KeelyNet.

           A very  brief  synopsis  of  the PUSH GRAVITY  concept  is  that
           gravity is  a  result  of  energy  streaming  INTO all planetary
           bodies (indeed,  according to  Keely  into  ALL  MASSES).   This
           streaming force not only holds mass together but  in its flow is
           interferred with to CREATE the slowed down energy we term mass.

           If Newtonian  gravity  is  accurate  in  stating that ALL MASSES
           ATTRACT, then why isn't the entire  universe a "clump of grapes"
           to use Walter Wright's phrase.  There is not a  single  physical
           experiment to PROVE the truth of Newtonian PULL gravity although
           Walter Wright  has  produced  DOZENS OF PHYSICAL MODELS to PROVE
           the PUSH gravity concept.

           He has  also  made  hundreds   of   challenges   to  scientists,
           government agencies and higher bodies of education (colleges and
           universities) to PROVE the Newtonian PULL gravity theory (taught
           as absolute truth) and DISPROVE his PUSH gravity  theory and ALL
           HAVE DECLINED!

           Other researchers  in  numerous fields, particularly dowsing and
           radionics have noted a DOWNPOURING of force which flows at right
           angles to the surface of the planet.   A NORMALLY LINEAR wind of
           energy.

           One of  the  most interesting researchers of Radionic  phenomena
           was aircraft  engineer  Darrell  Butcher.   We  have very little
           information regarding this man  or  details of his work, but the
           following comment   in  Mr.  Butcher's  own   words   is   quite
           interesting :

             "We are  going  to  discuss  the DOWNPOURING first.  This is a
              known force.  It has been  given  MANY  NAMES.   I  am of the
              personal opinion that it IS ALWAYS WITH US.  And that it does
              come down VERTICALLY under normal circumstances  and this can
              only be  made use of if we abide by the LAWS OF LIGHT, one of
              which states that :

                   "Vibrations of  the   ether   take  place,  NOT  in  the
                    DIRECTION OF THE WAVE, but in a plane  AT  RIGHT ANGLES
                    to it,   and   the   latter   are  called  'transversal
                    vibrations'."

             "This is from Ganot's Physics."

           The point  here is that this force  necessarily  PENETRATES  all
           mass as  it  moves downward and when encountering  the  patterns
           which make  up  "mass"  forms  ripples  at  right angles.  These
           ripples are the Chladni vibrations  as seen when a flat flexible
           plate with  sand sprinkled on it, is vibrated  to  form  complex
           patterns which are as stable as the sustaining energy.

           Mass creates  these stress waves (read interference patterns) as
           the energy  flows  through, interferes  with  and  sustains  the
           structure of  the  mass  itself.   Another  file   on   KeelyNet
           discussing this is PZT1.ASC.

                                      Page 4





           As anyone  with  an  electronics  background  knows,  if you can
           detect a wave, you can create that same type of wave with higher
           power versions of the same equipment.  That is why such research
           as this is so important.

           The claims that it is a GRAVITATIONAL  wave  might  be incorrect
           since the  Aether  spectrum  as mentioned in NEUTRAL1.ASC  shows
           gravity to  be  but  a "frequency or band of frequencies" within
           the Aether flow.

           Proof of  this  would  be an anti-gravity  effect  as  could  be
           generated by an intense (probably coherent beam) of this energy.
           Rather than  "create"  it,  redirecting  it would  be  the  most
           efficient means   of   demonstrating   that   it   is   truly  a
           gravitational force.

           The flow as detected by the researcher  in  GRAV3.ASC as well as
           in Gallimore's capacitor tests might be something entirely OTHER
           than gravity itself.  The results are far from  in  and  we will
           keep you  as  informed  as  we  can  based  on how much "public"
           information is shared with us.

           Gallimore claimed in a press release that he had built a GRAVITY
           LASER as partially described in GRAV9.ASC on KeelyNet.
