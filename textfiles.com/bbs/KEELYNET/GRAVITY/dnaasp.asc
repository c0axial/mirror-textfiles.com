       The following was extracted from "THE SECRET OF THE CREATIVE VACUUM"
       by John Davidson. It describes a simple but impressive experiment
       that  can  be  performed  by  anyone  interested  free  energy and
       gravitation.

       As we have said, the fundamental law of all differentiated forms is
       polarity or duality. It arises automatically when the One is first
       overlain by the greater, Formative Mind and is multiplied and
       endlessly reflected from that point into the myriad forms familiar
       to us. Yet the underlying and primal polarity remains clearly
       identifiable in all manifestation, even amongst the manyness in
       which we presently find ourselves.

       In our physics, whether conventional or vacuum state, the same
       applies.  All forms are interconnected and interwoven with this law
       of polarity and causality. Electrostatic charge, magnetic polarity,
       gravitational attraction, all these produce and are a part of the
       rotation which maintains things in existence.  They are all aspects
       of patterning in the kaleidoscopic image we call our physical world
       and think to be so real. And they are thus all related.

       The one can be expressed as the other if only we can see how the
       image is projected and can see how to tweak the projection system.
       So motion expressed as shape and rhythm - as differentiation in
       space and time - is so familiar to us that we feel that it can hold
       no secrets.  Yet since motion is our observation of patterns in
       space and time - both intrinsic physical realities we do not really
       comprehend - one cannot say that the true nature of motion is known
       to us. So if certain kinds of motion produce certain unexpected
       results, this is no more than we should expect, for we do not
       understand how time and space have come into being in the first
       place.

       It is not surprising therefore that Searl, Schauberger, Saxl and
       others  have  found  intriguing  and  unexpected  effects  and
       relationships. Nor are such phenomena confined to the work of
       independent researchers, for in recent years work in our British
       universities has demonstrated the same effect.

       Four  of  the  principle  protagonists  have  been  Professor Eric
       Laithwaite, Dr. Harold Aspden, Sandy Kidd and Scott Strachan. Eric

       Laithwaite, from London University's Imperial College, has been
       involved  with  research  into  magnetic  levitation  and  gyroscope
       research for many years.  Harold Aspden, from the Univeristy of
       Southampton, describes a simple and crucial experiment, demonstrated
       for him by Professor Laithwaite.

       The facts of the experiment are so remarkable that they would be
       unbelievable to anyone who has not witnessed at close quarters the
       demonstration by Professor Laithwaite.

       He takes hold of a shaft with two hands, holding it horizontally at
       knee height. An assistant then uses a power tool to spin a 50 pound
       flywheel at one end of the shaft until it is rotating at several
       thousand revolutions per minute.

       A 50 pound wheel rotating at this speed and held away from, but
       necessarily close to, the body commands respect for the dangers
       involved. It is not something that one expects to manipulate with
       ease.  However, one is aware that one could release the hold near
       the wheel and expect to be able to support the full weight of the
       system by one's other hand, without having to exert a couple
       manually via one's wrist, (ie. without needing to strain one's wrist
       to hold the shaft horizontal with the 50 pound weight on the other
       end).

       Indeed, it would lie outside the capacity of human strength to apply
       such a twist to the shaft axis.  What should then happen is that the
       wheel will precess* continuously in a horizontal plane, requiring
       the holder to turn around with it, keeping a firm grip on the end of
       the shaft.

           * precession means that the shaft - the axis of rotation -
                   'fixed' at one end by one's wrist, will describe a shape
                   like that of a cone - or a hyperbolic spiral.

       What is found, however, is that the free end of the shaft lifts with
       very little effort, totally incommensurate with the 50 pound weight
       at an angle of 32 degrees, which also happens to be the helix angle
       of 'type A' DNA, angle 32.7 degrees.

       This angle appears to be a fundamental constant and based on the
       reduced lifting force required when a rotating mass is lifted at
       this  angle,  it  appears  to  have  free  energy  and  anti-gravity
       applications.
