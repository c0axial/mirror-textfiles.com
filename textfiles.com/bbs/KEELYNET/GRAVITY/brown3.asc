                     A Method of and Apparatus or Machine for
                             Producing Force or Motion

         I, Thomas Townsend Brown, of 15, Eighth Street,  in  the  City  of
       Zanesville, State of  Ohio,  United  States of America, a citizen of
       the United States of America, do hereby  declare  the nature of this
       invention and in  what  manner  the  same is to be performed  to  be
       particularly described and  ascertained  in  and  by  the  following
       statement:ÄÄ

         This invention relates to a method  of controlling gravitation and
       for deriving power  therefrom, and to a method of  producing  linear
       force or motion. The method is fundamentally electrical.

         The invention  also  relates  to  machines  or apparatus requiring
       electrical energy that control or  influence the gravitational field
       or the energy of gravitation; also to machines or apparatus

                                      Page 1





       requiring electrical energy  that  exhibit  a linear force or motion
       which is believed to be independent  of all frames of reference save
       that which is at rest relative to the universe taken  as a whole and
       said linear force or motion is furthermore believed to have no equal
       and opposite reaction  that  can  be observed by any method commonly
       known and accepted by physical science to date.

         The invention further relates to machines or apparatus that depend
       for their force action or motive power on the gravitational field or
       energy of gravitation  that is being  controlled  or  influenced  as
       above stated; also, to machines or apparatus that depend  for  their
       force action or motive power on the linear force or motion exhibited
       by such machines or apparatus previously mentioned.

         The invention  further  relates  to  machines  and  apparatus that
       derive usable energy or power from the gravitational field or from
       the energy of  gravitation  by  suitable   arrangement,  using  such
       machines and apparatus as first above stated as principal agents.

         To show the universal adaptability of my novel method, said method
       is capable of  practical  performance  and  use  in connection  with
       motors for automobiles, space cars, ships, railway locomotion, prime
       movers for power installations, aeronautics.  Still another field is
       the use of  the  method and means enabling the same to function as a
       gravitator weight changer. Specific  embodiments  of  the  invention
       will be duly   disclosed   through   the  medium  of   the   present
       Specification.

         Referring to the accompanying drawings forming part of this
       Specification:

         Figure 1  is  an  elevation,  with  accompanying descriptive data,
                  broadly illustrating   the  characteristic  or  essential
                  elements associated with any machine or  apparatus in the
                  use of  which  the  gravitational  field or the energy of
                  gravitation is utilized  and controlled, or in the use of
                  which linear force or motion may be produced.

         Figure 2  is  a  similar view of negative and positive  electrodes

                  resistance or  induction at the negative  electrode;  and
                  also permitting,   where   desired,   the  conducting  of
                  excessive heat away from  the anode or positive electrode
                  by means of air or water cooling devices.

         Figure 6  is  an  elevation  of an embodiment of my invention in a
                  rotary or wheel type  of  motor  utilizing  the  cellular
                  gravitators illustrated in Figure 3.

         Figure 7 is a view similar to figure 6 of another  wheel  form  or
                  rotary type  of motor involving the use of the gravitator
                  units illustrated in Figure 5, or Figure 5¡.

         Figure 8 is a perspective view partly  in  section of the cellular
                  gravitator of Figure 3 illustrating the details thereof.

         Figures 9, 10 and 10a are detail views of the cellular gravitator.

         Figure 11  is  a  view  similar  to Figure 8 with  the  same  idea
                  incorporated in a rotary motor.

         Figures 12 and 13 are detailed views thereof.

         The general  showing in Figure 1 will make clear how my method for
       controlling or influencing  the gravitational  field  or  energy  of
       gravitation, or for producing linear force or motion, is utilized by
       any machine or  apparatus  having  the  characteristics  now  to  be
       pointed out.

         Such a  machine  has  major  parts  A  and  B.  These parts may be
       composed of any material capable of being charged electrically.

         Mass A and mass B may be termed  electrodes  A and B respectively.
       Electrode A is charged negatively with respect to  electrode  B,  or
       what is substantially  the  same,  electrode B is charged positively
       with respect to electrode A, or what is usually the case, electrode
       A has an excess of electrons while B has an excess of protons.

         While charged in this manner the  total force of A toward B is the
       sum force g (due to normal gravitational field), and force e (due to
       the imposed electrical field) and force x (due to the  resultant  of
       the unbalanced gravitational  forces  caused by the electro-negative
       charge or by the presences of an excess  of electrons on electrode A
       and by the electro-positive charge or by the presence  of  an excess
       of protons on electrode B).

         By cancellation of similar and opposing forces and by the addition
       of similar and  allied  forces the two electrodes taken collectively
       possess of force 2x in the direction  of  B.  The force 2x shared by
       both electrodes exists as a tendency of these electrodes  to move or
       accelerate in toward  B  and B away from A.  Moreover any machine or
       apparatus possessing electrodes A  and B will exhibit such a lateral
       acceleration or motion if free to move.

         Such motion  is  believed  to  be  due to the direct  control  and
       influence of the  energy  of  gravitation  by  the electrical energy
       which exists in  the  unlike  electrical   charges  present  on  the
       affected electrodes. The  motion  seems  to  possess   no  equal  or
       opposite motion that is detectable by the present day mechanics.

         It is to be understood that in explaining the theory underlying my
       invention I am  imparting  by  best  understanding  of  that theory,
       derived from practical  demonstration  by  the  use  of  appropriate
       apparatus made in  keeping  with  the  teachings   of   the  present
       Specification.
                                      Page 3





         The practice   of   the   method,  and  apparatus  aiding  in  the
       performance of the method, have been successful as herein disclosed,
       and the breadth of my invention and  discovery is such as to embrace
       any corrected or more refined theory that may be found  to  underlie
       the phenomena which I believe myself to be the first to discover and
       put to practical service.

         In this  Specification I have used terms as "gravitator cells" and
       "gravitator cellular body" which  are  words  of  my  own coining in
       making reference to  the particular type of cell  I  employ  in  the
       present invention. Whatever  the  construction involves the use of a
       pair of electrodes separated by an  insulating plate or member, such
       construction complies with the term gravitator cells,  and  when two
       or more gravitator cells are connected in series within a body, such
       will fall within the meaning of gravitator cellular body.

         In Figure  2  the  electrodes  A  and B are shown as having placed
       between them an insulating plate or  member  C of suitable material,
       such that the  minimum number of electrons or ions may  successfully
       penetrate it.  This constitutes a cellular gravitator consisting of
       one gravitator cell.

         A cellular gravitator, consisting of more than one cell, will have
       the cell units  connected  in  series.  This  type is illustrated in
       Figure 3, D  being  insulating members  and  E  suitable  conducting
       plates.  Various arrangements   of   cell  units,  each   possessing
       distinct advantages, may be resorted to.

         One arrangement,  such  as  just  referred  to,  is illustrated in
       Figure 6 of the drawings. Here the  cells  designated  F are grouped
       and spaced evenly around the circumference of a wheel G.

         Each group  of  cells  F possesses a linear acceleration  and  the
       wheel rotates as  a  result  of  the  combined  forces.  It  will be
       understood that, the cells being spaced substantial distances apart,
       the separation of  adjacent  positive   and   negative  elements  of
       separate cells is greater than the positive and negative elements of
       any cell, and the materials of which the cells are  formed being the
       more readily affected  by the phenomena underlying my invention than
       the mere space between adjacent cells,  any  forces existing between
       positive and negative elements of adjacent cells can never become of
       sufficient magnitude to neutralize or balance the force  created  by
       the respective cells adjoining said spaces.

         The uses  to  which  such  a  motor,  wheel or rotor may be put to
       practically limitless, as can be readily understood, without further
       description. The structure may suitably be called a gravitator motor
       of cellular type.

         In keeping  with the purpose of  my  invention  an  apparatus  may
       employ the electrodes A and B within a vacuum tube. This aspect of
       the invention is  shown  in  figures  4  and  5.  In  figure  4  the
       electrodes A and  B  are  such  as are adapted to be placed within a
       Vacuum tube H (Fig. 5), the frame and mounting being well within the
       province of the skilled artisan.

         Electrons, ions or thermions can  migrate readily from A to B. The
       construction may be  appropriately  termed  an electric,  ionic,  or
       thermionic gravitator as the case may be.

                                      Page 4





         In certain  of  the  last  named  types of gravitator units, it is
       desirable or necessary to heat to  incandescence the whole or a part
       of electrode A  to obtain better emission of negative  thermions  or
       electrons or at  least  to  be  able  to  control  that  emission by
       variation in the  temperature  of  said  electrode  A.   Since  such
       variations also influence the magnitude of the longitudinal force or
       acceleration exhibited by  the  tube,  it  proves   to   be  a  very
       convenient method of   varying   this  effect  and  of  electrically
       controlling the motion of the tube.

         The electrode A may be heated to  incandescence  in any convenient
       way as by  the ordinary methods utilizing electrical  induction,  an
       instance of the  former being shown at J (Fig. 5) and an instance of
       the latter at  J¡  (Fig.  5), the  vacuum  tube  in  fig.  5¡  being
       designated H¡.

         Moreover in  certain  types  of  the gravitator units,  now  being
       considered, it is  advantageous  or  necessary  also to conduct away
       from the anode or positive electrode  B  excessive heat which may be
       generated during the  operation  of tube H or H¡.  Such  cooling  is
       effected externally by means of air or water cooled flanges that are
       in thermo connection with the anode, or it is effected internally by
       passing a stream of water, air or other fluid through a hollow anode
       made especially for that purpose.

         Air cooled  flanges  are  illustrated  at  K (Fig. 5) and a hollow
       anode for the reception of a cooling  liquid  or  fluid  (as  air or
       water) is shown at K¡ (Fig. 5). These electric, ionic, or thermionic
       gravitator units may  be grouped in any form productive  of  desired
       force action or motion.

         One such form is the arrangement illustrated in Figure 7 where the
       particular gravitator units in question are indicated at L, disposed
       around a wheel  or  rotary motor similarly to the arrangement of the
       gravitator motor of cellular type  shown in Figure 6, the difference
       being that in Figure 7, the electric, ionic or thermionic gravitator
       units are utilized.  This motor may appropriately be designated as a
       gravitator motor of   the  electric,  ionic,  or  thermionic   type,
       respectively.

        The gravitator  motors  of Figures 6 and 7 may be supplied with the
       necessary electrical energy for the  operation  and resultant motion
       thereof from sources outside and independent of the motor itself. In
       such instances they  constitute  external  or independently  excited
       motors.

         On the  other  hand the motors when capable of creating sufficient
       power to generate by any method whatsoever for the operation of said
       motors are distinguished by being internal or self-excited. Here, it
       will be understood that the energy  created  by the operation of the
       motor may be at times be in excess of the energy required to operate
       the motor.

       IN SOME INSTANCES THE RATIO MAY BE EVEN AS HIGH AS A MILLION TO ONE.

         Inasmuch as  any  suitable  means  for  supplying   the  necessary
       electrical energy, and  suitable conducting means for permitting the
       energy generated by the motor to exert the expected influence on the
       same may be readily supplied, it is now deemed necessary to

                                      Page 5





       illustrate details herein.  In  said  self-excited motors the energy
       necessary to overcome  the  friction  or  other  resistance  in  the
       physical structure of  the  apparatus,  and even to  accelerate  the
       motors against such  resistance,  is  believed  to be derived solely
       from the gravitational field or the energy of gravitation.

         Furthermore, said  acceleration  in  the  self-excited  gravitator
       motor can be harnessed mechanically so as to produce  usable  energy
       or power, said  usable  energy or power, as aforesaid, being derived
       from or transferred  by the apparatus  solely  from  the  energy  of
       gravitation.

         The gravitator  motors  function  as a result of  the  mutual  and
       unidirectional forces exerted   by  their  charged  electrodes.  The
       direction of these forces and the  resultant motion thereby produced
       are usually toward   the  positive  electrode.  This   movement   is
       practically linear. It is this primary action with which I deal.

         As has  already  been  pointed  out  herein, there are two ways in
       which this primary action can accomplish  mechanical work. First, by
       operating in a  linear  path  as it does naturally,  or  second,  by
       operating in a  curved  path.  Since  the  circle is the most easily
       applied of all the geometric figures,  it follows the rotary form is
       the most important.  While  other  forms may be built  it  has  been
       considered necessary to  explain  and illustrate only the linear and
       rotary forms.

         The linear form of cellular gravitator is illustrated in detail in
       Figures 8, 9 and 10. It is built up  of  a number of metallic plates
       alternated or staggered with sheets of insulating material (Fig. 3).
       Each pair of plates so separated by insulation act as one gravitator
       cell, and each plate exhibits the desired force laterally.

         The potential  is  applied  on  the end plates and  the  potential
       difference is divided  equally  among the cells. Each metallic plate
       in the system  possesses  a  force  usually  toward  the  positively
       charged terminus, and the system  as a whole moves  or tends to move
       in that direction.  It is a linear motor, and the line of its action
       is parallel to the line of the electrodes.

        There are three general rules to follow in the construction of such
       motors.

           First, the insulating sheets should  be  as thin as possible and
                  yet have  a  relatively  high  puncture  voltage.  It  is
                  advisable also  to  use  paraffin-saturated insulators on
                  account of there high specific resistance.

           Second, the potential difference between any two metallic plates
                  should be as high as possible and yet be safely under the
                  minimum puncture voltage of the insulator.

           Third, there  should,  in most  cases,  be  as  many  plates  as
                  possible in  order  that the saturation  voltage  of  the
                  system might  be  raised  well  above the highest voltage
                  limit upon which the motor is operated.

         Reference has previously been made to the fact that in the


                                      Page 6





       preferred embodiment of  the invention herein disclosed the movement
       is toward the positive electrode.

          However, it will be clear that  motion  may  be  had  in  reverse
       direction determined by   what   I  have  just  termed   "saturation
       voltage", by which is meant the efficiency peak or maximum of action
       for that particular type of motor; the theory, as I may describe it,
       being that as the voltage is increased the force or action increases
       to a maximum  which represents the greatest action in a negative-to-
       positive direction.  If  the  voltage  were  increased  beyond  that
       maximum the action  would  decrease  to  zero  and   thence  to  the
       positive-to-negative direction.

         Referring more specifically to Figs. 8, 9, and 10, red fiber end
       plates 1 act  as  supports and end insulators and the first metallic
       plate 2 (for example aluminium) is  connected  electrically, through
       the fiber end plate, with the terminal 5.

         The second  insulating  sheet  3  is  composed,  for  example,  of
       varnished cambric some  times  known as "empire cloth". The relative
       size and arrangement of the metallic plate and insulating sheets are
       best seen in figures 9 and 10. A paraffin filler H is placed between
       adjacent insulating sheets around  the  edges of the metallic plates
       (Fig. 10a) and 6 represents a thin paraffin coating  over  the whole
       motor proper.

         7 and  8  indicate  successive layers of "empire cloth" or similar
       material, and 9  is  a binding tape  therefor.  A  thin  film  of  a
       substance such as black spirit varnish 10 protects and insulates the
       entire outer surface.

         A phosphor bronze safety gap element 11 is connected  electrically
       with the terminal  (not shown) opposite to the terminal 5.  A safety
       gap element corresponding  with   the  element  11  is  electrically
       connected with the  terminal  5, but has not been  shown,  in  order
       better to illustrate interior parts.

         The purpose of the safety gaps is to limit the voltage imposed on
       the motor to the predetermined maximum and to prevent puncture.

         The rotary motor (Figs. 11, 12 and 13), compress broadly speaking,
       an assembly of  a  plurality  of  linear motors, fastened to or bent
       around the circumference of a wheel.  In  that case the wheel limits
       the action of the linear motors to a circle, and the  wheel  rotates
       in the manner of a firework pin wheel.

         The illustrations I have given are typical. The forms of Figures 6
       and 7 have  been  defined.  In Figure 11, the insulating end disk 1a
       has an opening 2a therethrough for an extension of the shaft 12.

         The disk 1a is secured to a suitable  insulating  motor  shell, by
       fiber bolts or screws in any convenient manner, there  being another
       of these disks  at the opposite end of the shell, in the same manner
       as the opposite end plates 1 in figure  8.  The cells are built upon
       an insulating tube 11a disposed about the shaft-space 3a.

         Thick insulating  wedges  4a  separate  the  four   linear  motors
       illustrated.  These thick    insulating   wedges,   so-called,   are
       substantially greater in the body than the aggregate insulating

                                      Page 7





       sheets of the  units.  In  some  instances,  however, dependent upon
       materials employed for the charged  elements and insulating members,
       this need not necessarily be the case.

         In each  motor of this circular series of motors,  there  are  the
       alternate sheets of  insulation  5a  associated  with  the alternate
       metallic plates 6a: paraffin fillers  7a  along  the  edges  of  the
       plates 6a and  between  the  insulating  sheets  5a  being  employed
       similarly to the use of paraffin in Figure 8.

         The rotary  motor  is encircled by metallic (preferably) collector
       rings 10a which are connected with  the  end  metallic plates of the
       separate linear motors  at  9a  and  13  (Fig.  12),  one  of  these
       connections 9 being shown in detail where the insulating tube is cut
       away at 8 (Fig. 11).

         It is  unnecessary  herein  to illustrate a housing, and good ball
       bearings, conveniently supplied,   will   complete  the  motor.  The
       potential is applied to the safety gap mounted on  the  housing  and
       thence is conducted  to the collector rings of the motor by means of
       sliding brushes.

         While I have in the forgoing Specification outlined, in connection
       with the broader aspects of my invention, certain forms and details,
       I desire it understood that specific  details  have been referred to
       for the purpose of imparting a full and clear understanding  of  the
       invention, and not  for purposes of limitation, because it should be
       apparent that many changes in construction and arrangement, and many
       embodiments of the  invention, other  than  those  illustrated,  are
       possible without departing from the spirit of the invention  or  the
       scope of the appended claims.

         Having now particularly described and ascertained the nature of my
       said invention and  in  what  manner  the same is to be preformed, I
       declare that what I claim is:ÄÄ

         1. A method of producing force or motion, which comprises the step
            of aggregating  the  predominating   gravitational  lateral  or
            linear forces  of positive and negative charges  which  are  so
            cooperatively related as to eliminate or practically eliminate
            the effect  of  the  similar  and  opposing  forces  which said
            charges exert.

         2. A method of producing force or motion, in which a mechanical or
            structural part is associated  with  at least two electrodes or
            the like,  of which the adjacent electrodes or  the  like  have
            charges of    differing    characteristics,    the   resultant,
            predominating, uni-directional   gravitational  force  of  said
            electrodes or the like being utilized to produce  linear  force
            or motion of said part.

         3. A method according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the predominating
            force of  the  charges  or  electrodes  is  due  to  the normal
            gravitational field and the imposed electrical field.

         4. A method according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, in which the electrodes
            or other elements bearing the charges are mounted, preferably
            rigidly, on the body or support adapted to move or exert force


                                      Page 8





            in the  general  direction  of  alignment  of the electrodes or
            other charge-bearing elements.

         5. A machine or apparatus for producing  force  or  motion,  which
            includes at least two electrodes or like elements adapted to be
            differently charged, so relatively arranged that they produce a
            combined linear  force  or motion in the general  direction  of
            their alignment.

         6. A machine according to claim 5, in which the electrodes or like
            elements are   mounted,   preferably   rigidly,   whereby   the
            predominating uni-directional    force    obtained   from   the
            electrodes or  the  like  is adapted to move said  part  or  to
            oppose forces  tending  to  move it COUNTER to the direction in
            which it would be moved by the  action of the electrodes or the
            like.

         7. A  machine  according  to  claim  5 or 6, in which  the  energy
            necessary for charging the electrodes or the like is obtained
            either from   electrodes  themselves  or  from  an  independent
            source.

         8. A machine according to Claim  5,  6 or 7, whose force action or
            motive power  depends  on  part on the gravitational  field  or
            energy of  gravitation which is controlled or influenced by the
            action of the electrodes or the like.

         9. A machine according to any of  Claims  5 to 8, in the form of a
            motor including a gravitator cell or gravitator  cellular body,
            substantially as described.

        10. A  machine  according  to  Claim  9,  in  which  the gravitator
            cellular body or an assembly of the gravitator cells is mounted
            on a wheel-like support, whereby rotation of the latter maybe
            effected, said cells being of  electric,  ionic  or  thermionic
            type.

        11. A method of controlling or influencing the gravitational  field
            or the  energy  of gravitation and for deriving energy or power
            therefrom comprising the use of at least two masses differently
            electrically charged,  whereby  the  surrounding  gravitational
            field is affected or distorted by the imposed  electrical field
            surrounding said  charged masses, resulting in a unidirectional
            force being on the system of  charged  masses  in  the  general
            direction of  the  alignment of the masses, which  system  when
            permitted to  move  in  response  to  said  force  in the above
            mentioned direction derives  and  accumulates  as the result of
            said movement  usable  energy  or  power  from  the  energy  of
            gravitation or  the gravitational field which is so controlled,
            influenced, or distorted.

        12. The method of and the machine  or apparatus for producing force
            or motion  by  electrically  controled  or  in influencing  the
            gravitational field or energy of gravitation, substantially as
            hereinbefore described   with  reference  to  the  accompanying
            drawings.
