         The following  file has two fascinating images associated with it.
                       They are FARROW1.GIF and FARROW2.GIF.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       I  had seen  this information  when I  bought Fords book a couple of
       years ago  and meant to  put them online.  However,  other interests
       took  over and  I forgot  all about  it.  Thanks to Rod Fredlund for
       scanning in the images and sending it up to us to be shared with
       everyone.

                                This is taken from
              "Tesla Coil Secrets; Construction Notes and Novel Uses"
                       by R. A.  Ford, pages 69-71 entitled
               "Reduction of Weight Using a Hertzian Wave Generator"

       In 1911, New  York engineer and inventor Edward S.  Farrow  publicly
       described his work with a "condensing dynamo".

       When this electrical  device  was  placed on weight scales and power
       applied, the dynamo and any small  weight  attached to it, proceeded
       to lose 1/6th of its weight (3 ounces).

       In the photo the total weight was 18 ounces before  the power was on
       and it dropped down to 15 ounces while in operation.

       In Farrow's explanation, he said that the dynamo acted to "intensify
       the vertical component"  of  the  Hertzian waves which it generated.
       This intensifaction produced buoyancy  in  any  object  to which the
       unit was attached.

       The unusual pattern  of  Hertzian  waves  fanned   out   in  a  thin
       horizontal plane of electromagnetic stress over a broad area.

       The condensing dynamo  employed  either  a  horizontal row or a ring
       consisting of a  series  of  interrupters   or   breaks  (gaps)  for
       producing this field.

       The ring of electrical breaks extended in a horizontal  line  around
       the perimeter of  the device. Power and frequency of the oscillators
       were not given.

       The buoyant effect is similar to that  produced by floating a sewing
       needle on water. Although the steel has a much higher  density  than
       the water below  it,  the surface tension permits the linkup of many
       surrounding water molecules in a thin film or sheet.

       Similarly, the dynamo  lifts  against the strong gravitational field
       by REACTION against the weak geomagnetic field.

       The interaction over a very wide  area  between  this  field and the
       Hertzian waves produces electrical buoyancy.   No  U.S.  patent  was
       received on the invention.

       Norm Wootan tells us another version of this story from another book
       yet with additional  information,  essentially  the  same except for
       mentioning that Mr. Farrow had demonstrated  his  device at the 1926
       World's Fair.

       We will pursue  this angle and create another FARROW  or  append  to
       this one when we get any new information.

       There are MANY  correlations  for this phenomenon, most of which use
       different types of force, geometry  or  motion.   They include sonic
       (voice, tuning forks/bars, oscillators), spinning masses, gyroscopic
       precession, high voltage, etc..

       If anyone has  additional  information  regarding  this   intriguing
       research, we would   appreciate   hearing  of  it  in  the  form  of
       photocopies mailed to our address as above, or as an upload.
