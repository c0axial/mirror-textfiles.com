To speak of time "flowing" is misleading, as many have noted.  Flow is change
with respect to *something else*, and so for time to flow, it would have to
change with respect to something else.  What would that be? Some 'other' time?
Space?

The latter seems a more reasonable suggestion to me, but then you have the
problem of explaining rates of change in space, which in turn refer to
something else... i.e. time.

The simplest solution seems to be that the space and time aspect of events and
processes are not to be defined separately, but rather form a whole. i.e. you
have terms and relations that fix each other (space, time as terms, velocity
as one relation).

But on the question of tachyon time reversal...

Indulge my amateurish curiosity once more:

   if the direction of efficient causality (the causality which matches our
   everyday notion of 'causing') is reversed for tachyons, do they not
   represent a way for the future to act on the past?

If so, consider this:

   suppose that a German research institute were to develop a "tachyon
   transmitter" in the year 2937. Who (or, better, "When?") would be able to
   receive those signals?

Pretty damn implausible at this point, I realize...

Vanguard Note...

  The question is not so much WHO would be able to receive the signals, but
  to WHAT POINT IN TIME would they go?  Since vibration is associated with
  'translation' to higher levels of being, then perhaps a means could be
  produced to increase the vibration of a test mass, on a MICRO level, not
  MACRO.

  After all, isn't a tachyon a 'faster than light' particle?  Just as a paper
  straw can be run through a telephone pole without damage, so too could other
  mass be moved, while remaining in a stationary position, to produce a
  'shift' or translation.  The nature of this shift remains to be seen,  but
  using phase conjugation, the wave might be reversible to some degree.  See
  the file DUALVELO on KeelyNet, where a theory is postulated which calls for
  an INVARIANT MASS because the Lorentz transformation only applies to
  VELOCITY.

  It is my understanding that time exists only because of its association with
  mass aggregations.  The 'speed' or forward velocity of time is based on the
  intensity of the 'gravity' flows into the neutral centers of all mass in the
  region.  Keely said 'time is gravity', possibly the most elegant and
  accurate description of the 'dual' phenomenon ever uttered.

  As a 'spook' aside, some psychics say they are told by discarnates that
  there is no 'serial time' in the afterlife, because the spirit is not bound
  to the 'earthly plane' by the forces that produce 'gravity.'

  And one psychic claims that time is concurrent and can be accessed using
  various techniques including pharmacopeia.  The concurrency idea is
  intriguing because this psychic says he can actually visit people in the
  past because they still exist as frames in our 'time'.  The primary link is
  to LOCATION, in other words, you have to go to the place where past things
  happened to be able to interface with 'past' events or personalities.

  If this concurrency idea is correct, then it would be a 'Slider'/Incunabula
  type of shift because quantum realities must link from some common
  reference, i.e. location. ..................Jerry/Sysop/KeelyNet
