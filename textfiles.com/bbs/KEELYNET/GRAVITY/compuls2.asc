IV.  RADIATIONAL THEORY OF GRAVITATION AND COSMOLOGICAL FINDINGS

The new theory makes it possible to solve some of the important cosmological
problems.

Causes of the rotation of the Earth and other cosmic bodies.

Gravitational interaction between the Sun, Earth and cosmic material radiation
forces the Earth to stay on its orbit, i.e. at such a distance from the Sun
where the repulsive effect of solar radiation is just equal to the compulsive
effect of cosmic radiation.  The Earth is thus all the time exposed to the
effect of a pair of opposite forces (effects):  repulsion and compulsion.  The
resulting vectors of this pair of effect are of the same length but opposite
direction:  the repulsive vector goes in helio-geo-petal, the compulsive
vector in geo-helio-petal direction.  And it is just this pair of forces
(effects) incessantly acting on the Earth that is the generator of the
rotation of the Earth.

Causes of the orbiting motion of planets and other cosmic bodies.

The same pair of opposite forces causing rotation is involved in the origin
of the orbiting planetary motion.  Findings from aerodynamics and
hydrodynamics on the effect of collision between two opposite streams of
medium can be used for the zone of opposite penetration of two radiation
streams.  A floating body is not only rotating but performing a translative
movement crossing the direction of both streams.  This regularity is expressed
by the so-called Magnus effect:  A rotating body exposed to a current
perpendicular to the axis of rotation travels in the direction perpendicular
both to the current and to the axis of its rotation.  The generator of the
orbiting motion of the planets is thus permanent interpenetration of repulsive
solar and compulsive cosmic radiation.

Cause of the origin of elliptic paths of the planets of the solar system.
Explanation of Kepler's laws.

The orbit of a planet is a sum of points in which the mechanical repulsive
effect of solar radiation and compulsive effect of cosmic radiation are
levelled out.  On condition that both solar and cosmic radiation are
homogeneous, symmetrical, the planetary orbit would be a circle.  Only cosmic
radiation can be permanently asymmetric.  The elliptic paths of the planets
can arise only by the action of the cosmic factor.  It must be presupposed
that the penetration of cosmic radiation through our solar system is
asymmetrical, that there is more intensive arrival from the side of the
eccentrically positioned Sun and planetary perihelion.  Vector of this
unidirectional prevalence of cosmic radiation and vectors of repulsion and
compulsion of the planet are added up determining the elliptic path of the
planet and changing the orbiting velocity and rotational impulse of the
planet.  In this way Kepler's laws can be derived and their validity
explained.  The source of increased unidirectional arrival of cosmic radiation
can be a cluster of nearby stars or part of the core of our Galaxy.  It is
less likely that the asymmetrical passage should, on the contrary, be due to
shading of immense masses of reduced radiation from the opposite direction.

The principle of variable sped of light.

The principle of constant speed of light postulated by Einstein in his
special theory of relativity is rejected.  Changes in the speed of the motion
of minisystems of the cosmic radiation including the motion of the light
photon are described.  Initial speed of light is given by the release of the
radiation minisystem from the bond inside the atoms of the radiating body.
The movement of the emitting source in the direction of the ray is manifested
by the Doppler effect.  During the journey of the light beam through the vast
provinces of the Universe the speed of light is slowed down (together with
simultaneous retardation of the bound movement of the inner components of the
system) in regions distant from large masses, and near bodies with high
emission of radiation (particularly also before its target incidence upon the
Sun).  On the contrary, the speed of light grows near highly condensed masses
of high radiational shading and before target incidence upon the Earth.

The redshift problem.

Adopting the principle of variable speed of light it is possible to present
a new explanation of the origin of redshift and blueshift of the spectrum.
E.g. the extreme redshift of a quasar is conditioned by a considerable slow-
down of the departing velocity of the light minisystem at the very emission
out of highly condensed mass and, in addition to that, by the effect of the
intensive radiational (gravitational) shade.  The absolute prevalence of
redshift in the spectra of galaxies is exclusively due to the fact that the
global velocity of the minisystem of light radiation is slowed down (and so is
the bound whirling motion of its inner constituents) on its passage through
the immense intergalactic space.  It thus is not any manifestation of the
conjectural retreat of all galaxies.  The Hubble law in its general
formulation does not apply.  The hypothesis of an expanding Universe must be
rejected, too.

The quasar and pulsar problem.

The origin of a quasar from the masses ejected out of the exploding galaxy
has been proved beyond any doubt.  In the author's opinion, under special
conditions the process of gradual immense condensation in the masses of the
original star can develop without the necessary overture of a catastrophe.
Condensation of the quasar mass is reflected in the reduction of its own
emission of radiation, extreme increase in radiational (gravitational) shade,
and intensive absorption of cosmic radiation leading to further growth of the
amount of mass and its condensation.  The emitted minisystems of material
radiation show a slowed-down global departing velocity and speed of the bound
inner motion of its constituents (i.e. minisystems of a lower order).  This is
the  cause of the huge redshift and high participation of the radio noise
coming from the quasar.  The idea that a quasar might be an evolutional pre-
stage of new galaxies is highly improbable.  The tremendous condensation of
masses, i.e. rise in the amount of bound motion of the particles (inner
energy) can rather be said to lead to a "quasi spontaneous" explosion or to be
provoked by a collision with a star (in both cases the result of the
catastrophe is a Nova).  If the quasar penetrates as far as the nucleus of a
galaxy, the result of the explosion is a Supernova.

The black hole, white hole and wormhole problem.

In a critical and detailed analysis all the conclusions derived form the
"rigorous solution of Einstein's equations of the gravitational field", "the
mirror-image reversal of this solution", "maximal extension of the space-time
metric", "solution of the equations of the gravitational field of a spherical
body with and without rotation", construction of various Kruskal diagrams,
etc., are rejected.  They are products of extreme mathematical formalism and
solipsism isolated from objective reality.  Such ideas are pseudoscientific,
fantastic, even mystical.

V.  RADIATIONAL THEORY OF GRAVITATION AND EARTH'S GRAVITY

The Earth's gravity is no manifestation of any assumed attractive force acting
immediately at distance.  The weight of objects and free fall to the Earth
are due to the compulsive effect of cosmic radiation in the area of intensive
radiational (gravitational) shade of the Earth.

All the findings on the Earth's gravity can be perfectly explained in terms of
the radiational theory of gravitation.  Moreover, all the problems accumulated
so far and the so-called anomalies of gravity can be solved.  Departures from
the classical conception can be explained by the fact that the effect of
gravity is slightly weakened by the Earth's own emission (though small), that
radiational shading by large masses on the relief of the Earth surface becomes
manifested, and that the composition of the Earth's surface strata can change
both local intensity of the earth's radiational shade, and reflection and
absorption of cosmic radiation.

The tide problem.

Newton's classical explanation of the tides as due to the attractive force
of the Moon, or perhaps the Sun as well upon the mass of movable sea waters
is considered unsatisfactory.  Detailed reasons for a different explanation
are give.  Mutual radiational (gravitational) shade between the Earth and the
Moon gives rise to definite gradient of the mechanical effect of cosmic
radiation.  The initial and active phase of the tide is the ebb due to
prevalence of cosmic radiation in the tangential band of the smallest
gravitational shading of the Earth by the Moon.  All the peculiarities and
so-called anomalies of the tides can be explained in this way.  The same
holds for the tides of the Earth's crust.
