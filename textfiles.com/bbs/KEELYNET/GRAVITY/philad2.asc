       Have you made any contact with Alfred Bielek who claims to have been
       on the Eldrige?   If so, or if you are aware of his  claims  do  you
       believe he is credible?

       Richard,
       I know Al  Bielek.   He  has been to my home.  I have questioned him
       from every angle and cannot determine  whether  or not he is telling
       the truth.  He must have some inside information source  because  he
       knows about Project RAINBOW, an experiment in time travel.  I do not
       know the results  of RAINBOW but saw documents about its purpose.  I
       am keeping an open mind on Bielek at this time.

                         ___ The Philadelphia Experiment__

         1930's in  Chicago  -  N.  Tesla  and  two  other  people  discuss
                             possibilities of making things invisible.

         1933 - Institute of Advanced Studies at Princeton formed.

         1934 - Project with grants fron  navy  transferred  to  Princeton,
                N.J., Tesla, Einstein, Dr. John Von Neumann were present.

         1936 - Tesla becomes director of project('36-'42). He had done
                previous work for navy and knew Pres. Roosevelt.

         1940 - Small destroyer, unmanned, used in 1st successful test.

         1943 July 22nd - Manned test. Invisible for 15-20 min. Men were
              disoriented physically and mentally but there were no deaths.

         1943 Aug. 12th.- Navy gave no time to work out personnel  problems
              but the equipment was changed to give only radar invisibility
              so that the ships would not collide at sea.

              Then the  famous experiment.  For the first minute everything
              went well; the Eldridge was radar invisible and its outline
              could be seen hazily.  Then a blue flash of light happened
              and the ship completely disapeared  for  three  hours with no
              radio contact.  When it came back, observers  knew  something
              was wrong.

              The antenna  mast had snapped and parts of the superstructure
              were damaged. Radio contact could not be made so the ship was
              boarded, and the real extent  of  the damage was found.  Four
              men were embedded in the ships steel-two on the top decks and
              two in the bulkheads.

              One sailors' hand was embedded to a wall and  was  amputated.
              Men were   disoriented,  and  reports  were  that  some  were
              floating around-some disapearring.

              Others went completely, utterly insane.  Four days of meeting
              were had to determine what to do and what had gone wrong.  No
              conclusions were made but  it  was  decided  to  run  another
              unmanned test.   This test was towed and remotely  controlled
              without crew!

              The results  were that the ships equipment were burned up and
              missing, despite another successful 20 minute vanishing.  The
              navy gave  up  and  retuned   the   Eldridge  to  duty  after
              refitting.  The video tape goes into more details and the
              story is much like the movie.

              After the war, the experiments were continued  with  Dr.  Von
              Neumann (computer  developer and brilliant mathamatician) and
              others.  Einstein and Tesla  had  left during the first tests
              under protests that it would be a disaster to  the  personnel
              on board the ship.

              The developments   were   wide   ranged   and   became   very
              metaphysical later on.  I will try to outline these projects.

         1.  Philadelphia Experiment: August 1943 as previously described.

              a. Rainbow experiment in time travel.

         2.  Phoenix I Project: 1947-1968 - Based in old radar station
             in Montauk, N.Y.

              a. Stealth Technology
              b. Wilhelm Reichs' orgone energy/weather control

         3.  Phoenix II Project: 1969-1979  25 satellite linked stations -
             very expesive but no government money used.  Joint air force
             and navy with Von Neumann, Jack Pruet, and 30 personnel.
             Later funded by ITT, owned by the Krupp group of Germany.

              a. Mind control: electro/orgone energy beam. Altered
                 subjects (at  first  it killed them) and perhaps programed
                 them.

              b. Mind or thought amplification: created thought forms which
                 were real  only as long  as  switch  was  turned  on.   (I
                 theorize the wheat field rings could be coming  from  this
                 brain equipment.)  Was used to create time "vortex", which
                 was put on tape to produce a time "tunnel".

         4.  Phoenix III  1979-? (1983 in Montauk,N.Y.)

              a. Time machine operations.

                 - thousands of people were altered or programmed.
                 - like a "mission control"  operators  could see, hear,and
                   direct the door to the person who had gone to a time and
                   place to perform some task.  Tapes were  also  made, now
                   under heavy guard.
                 - Beyond  year  2014  or  so  a "wall" was encountered and
                   Cameron described a  deserted  city,  with  a  dreamlike
                   quality to it.
                 - Travelers would be returned just before  they  had  left
                   and so  couldn't  remember  the  trip.  A  form of brain
                   washing.
                 - Vortex tunnel propelled  subject through a fluted, cork-
                   screw, oddly turning path to destination.
                 - Alien technology and even assistance  was  used  to make
                   all of this possible.
                 - The  bases  are  probably  underground now.  Montauk was
                   abandoned in  haste  when  a  thought  created  creature
                   rampaged the base until the power could be cut!

          A little hard to swallow?

       Vangard Note...

           Undoubtedly, this  is  one  of  the most illiterate files I have
           ever seen, it has taken me fully 20 minutes to manually weed out
           the incorrect spellings.  One  thing I have noted with those who
           follow such unproveable assertions as this file  contains  is an
           overwhelmingly obvious  demonstration  of their lack of language
           and communication skills.  This  shows through massive errors in
           the spelling of simple words and the compilation of sentences to
           elucidate a point.  Typos are one thing but sheesh...

           Well, now  that I have that off my chest, what  about  the  info
           contained in  the  file?  As a beginning, I suggest you read the
           file BIELEK1 on KeelyNet.  You  will  note that a great majority
           of the   junk   currently   associated  with  the   Philadelphia
           Experiment project  is  TAKEN FROM THE MOVIE thanks to Al Bielek
           and his amazingly absorptive and integrative habits when exposed
           to information new to him, whether  that  information is factual
           or fantasy, if he sees a way to fit it in, he will include it in
           his "rap."   Bielek  openly  claims to have "remembered"  things
           which he  now  claims  actually  happened  to  him  AFTER  being
           prompted by the movie.

           Unfortunately, others also have this "ability" and are supported
           by those unwillingly to look  beyond  and  ask  for confirmation
           derived from historical sources and NOT movies  or the Hollywood
           concept of  what happened.  This follows with the Cult of Tesla.
           There are many who treat the  work  of  Tesla as if he were some
           kind of Messiah.  We continally see papers written making claims
           that are simply not supported historically or by Teslas writings
           or works.

           Free energy, anti-gravity, time travel, mind control  and a host
           of other claims which are woven together into "new" documents to
           further help confuse the issue of what he really did and what is
           useable today.    Yes,   the   rotating   magnetic   field,  the
           transmission of  AC  power  and   the  invention  of  radio  are
           fantastic achievements, yet no one can be or has been all things
           to all   people.   Additionally,  there  are   many   UFO   type
           "spokesmen" who  make  a  very good living off the deluded folks
           who choose to support their claims by attending presentations or
           purchasing products which these  people  generate based on their
           "research" or  "experiences".   Well,  this  document   is   now
           included on  KeelyNet  in  the  interest  of  fairness and as an
           additional Philadelphia Experiment file.
