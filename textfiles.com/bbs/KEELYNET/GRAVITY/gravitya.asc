                                  UFO PROPULSION?
                                    by A. Steel

       One of the many subjects frequently  discussed  by  ufologers is the
       method of propulsion  used by our interplanetary visitors  in  their
       flying saucers, cigar-shaped craft and various other shaped craft
       so often observed.   The  members  of  TUFOS  are  no  exception and
       frequent discussion on  the  subject   produces   many   interesting
       theories.

       The following speculation  is  the  result of talks  with  committee
       members and it  was felt in presenting the theory - via ORBIT - that
       much criticism and comment would be invited from conventional-minded
       ufologers.

       Flying saucers are not conventional craft, therefore it is felt that
       an UNCONVENTIONAL APPROACH to them  AND  THEIR ENVIRONMENT should be
       made.

       Flying saucers apparently do not use rocket motors  or other obvious
       forceful methods of propulsion.  Briefly, these craft can accelerate
       without apparent limitation,  frequently  disappear,  are  sometimes
       silent and have been heard buzzing or humming.

       They can remain  perfectly  stationary   in   high  winds  and  seem
       unaffected by heat friction or gravity problems.

       If these craft then are not motivated by propeller,  jet  or  rocket
       what does that leave use to consider?

       I consider gravitational   repulsion/attraction   to   be  the  only
       possible method but  -  and  a  big  BUT  -  not  using  gravity  as
       theoretically expounded by   Newton  and  accepted   by   our   more
       conventional friends.


                                      Page 1





       In pursuing this  theory  of  UFO  propulsion,  I  consider  it most
       important to TAKE A NEW VIEW of planetary  and  solar  energy fields
       and I would advance for your consideration the following theory.

       It is my  contention  that gravity is NOT A PULL from  Earth  but  a
       PRESSURE FROM SPACE.

       The atmospheric pressure  of  17 pounds per square inch which is the
       result of an external Earth field force ORIGINATING FROM THE SUN.
        (more precisely...14.7 PSI at 32 degress F at sea level...Vangard)


       Consider the following.  Evidence from very high flying aircraft and
       space capsules indicate extremely  low temperatures, low pressure or
       gravity and less light than on the Earth's surface.

       The higher one  goes  (into space), the less obvious  is  heat,  and
       gravity pressure, which to my way of thinking can ONLY mean that the
       Earth's field OR ATMOSPHERE is responsible for PROVIDING light, heat
       and pressure by CONVERGING SOLAR ENERGY wavelengths INTO these three
       conditions.  (interference with lower frequency spectra resulting)

       This retained-filtered-modified energy  wavelength  is  known as the
       gravitational field with  a  propounded   pole   directional   force
       indicated by a compass needle.

       The Earth is cocooned in a self made energy field with  the lines of
       force going polewards  and  EVENTUALLY ESCAPING at the 'holes in the
       poles'.  What are the 'holes in the poles'?

       The Earth, we are informed, is travelling  around the Sun at a speed
       in excess of 66,000 miles per hour and revolves around  its  axis at
       approximately 1,000 mile per hour.  (1,020 at the equator)

       Compare the Earth   to   a  ball  on  a  jet  of  water,  the  water
       representing the energy  force   of  the  Sun.   The  ball  will  be
       suspended at a certain distance from the jet depending  on  its mass
       or weight and will absorb the impact, revolving as it does so.

       The ball in revolving retains a film of water on its surface and the
       water jet does  not actually strike the ball but strikes the film of
       water which is constantly being renewed  and  replaced  and so it is
       with the Earth.

       Solar energy pressure   will   therefore  be  acting   AGAINST   the
       ATTRACTION of mass  FOR  mass.   The  equatorial region of the earth
       field RECEIVES THE FULL IMPACT of energy from the Sun, the energy is
       converted and deflected to the slower,  axial  moving  poles and the
       energy is pushed or escapes off into space.

       An American satellite which was launched northwards  shot  off  into
       space, drawn off  by this energy leak hole and - as a result - Earth
       satellites have since been launched  so  as  NOT  to  fly off at the
       poles.

       Now, back to  flying saucers.  In considering the  above  theory,  I
       have reached the  conclusion  that the method of propulsion possibly
       adopted by flying saucers would be  to  DUPLICATE,  WITHIN the Earth
       planetary-field, the conditions found outside it, i.e., NO HEAT, NO

                                      Page 2





       PRESSURE FORCE and,  as  a  result, NO LIGHT, a field barrier around
       the craft excluding the natural Earth field.

       This may be the answer as to why flying  saucers  seem to glow, then
       disappear as they  accelerate.  In duplicating the conditions  found
       outside the Earth magnetic fields, the saucer-created field EXCLUDES
       HEAT, PRESSURE FORCE and the REFLECTION OF LIGHT WAVES.

       By subjecting the  flying  saucer  to  the  downward  Earth-produced
       pressures, the saucer moves down,  by  REJECTING  this  pressure  in
       REPRODUCING THE EARTH-FIELD  CONDITION  the  saucer   moves  up  and
       similarly by subjecting or rejecting the N.S. or S.N. Earth pressure
       field indicated by  a  compass  needle the saucer moves in either of
       these directions.

       Flying saucers are often traced as moving in straight lines and many
       maps have been produced indicating  this  behavior.   I suspect that
       the saucers have been moving along these magnetic  force  lines  and
       then shooting off  at a 90 degree angle by SOME METHOD OF REJECTION,
       i.e. bouncing off sideways.

       A similar method of propulsion could  be  employed  out  in space by
       reproducing around the craft an Earth pressure field and BECOMING IN
       FACT A MINIATURE PLANET with a magnetic field subject  to  the solar
       energy pressure and  being  REPELLED  or  ATTRACTED  by  this energy
       WAVELENGTH.

       The occupants of the flying saucers  will, of course, not suffer any
       discomforture at these  high speeds and manoeuvres.   They  will  be
       contained within their  own  pressure  field  and  not be subject to
       external forces and changes of direction.

       A simple example of this protective force field can be observed
       in the following experiment.

       If a glass jar is completely filled with water, a fish placed in the
       jar, and the  jar  tightly capped,  the  fish  can  be  said  to  be
       contained within a pressure force field.

       Violent movement of the jar in any direction will have  no effect on
       the fish, it  will  not  be  bumped from side to side OR up and down
       because it is carried along SUSPENDED  and  PROTECTED  in this field
       and is not subject to external pressures or directional change.

       In the same way, the occupants of the flying saucers  are  obviously
       capable of retaining a constant state of non-gravity!

       Vangard Notes...

           Mr. Walter  Wright is the modern proponent of PUSH GRAVITY as he
           calls it.  He has NEVER been  disproven  in  his contentions and
           has dozens  of  very  excellent  models to illustrate  the  PUSH
           GRAVITY principle.    The   models  use  magnets  to  provide  a
           repellent force equivalent to that of a repelling field.

           We first met Walter at a 1989 Global Sciences Congress in Denver
           and have since maintained a correspondence  with him.  He showed
           a special  video  tape  made  up  just for Global  Sciences  and
           clearly demonstrating the PUSH GRAVITY idea.

                                      Page 3





           Walter gives  credit  for the initial impetus to investigate the
           PUSH GRAVITY concept to his son  TOM.   Tom was only 6 years old
           when he told his father that he did not believe  that  the  Moon
           created the tides.  When Walter asked him why, Tom launched into
           his idea of a pushing force which created pressure waves to move
           the water.

           The idea  so  intrigued  Walter  that he began investigating the
           possibility.  As a result he is totally sold on PUSH GRAVITY and
           his models and presentations are  so convincing that we can only
           urge you to CHECK IT OUT!!

           Walter has a very good book, "GRAVITY IS A PUSH"  which  you can
           purchase from him for about $15, as well as a complete series of
           video tapes  showing his various models, about $10 per tape.  At
           last count the video tapes exceeded  29.   They are narrated and
           will blow you away if you choose to see them.   He  also  has  a
           PUSH GRAVITY museum of his models which is open to the public.

           Walter makes  nothing  from duplicating the tapes, he just wants
           to get his work out to the greatest  number of people.  We found
           Walter to be SUPER COOL, intelligent, thoughtful  and persistent
           as hell.  He has spent tens of thousands$ to promote the idea.

           Walter also thinks he has discovered ANOTHER PLANET in our solar
           system which  he named TIOM after his two sons, Tim and Tom.  He
           has some of the most interesting  explanations  for a variety of
           phenomena and  which  have  not been successfully  explained  by
           modern science.

           Walter has  openly  challenged scientists, physicists, engineers
           and teachers to disprove ANY of his PUSH GRAVITY theories,
                                NONE HAVE ACCEPTED!
