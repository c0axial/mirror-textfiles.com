                      METHODS TOWARD A FUSION REACTOR THROUGH
                         MAGNETIC CONFINEMENT AND HEATING


       The object of the Controlled Thermonuclear Research (CTR) program is
       to provide a  new and essentially  inexhaustible  energy  source  by
       controlling thermonuclear reactions-the energy source of the sun and
       the stars.

       The explosion of   a   hydrogen   bomb  is  an  example   of   rapid
       thermonuclear energy release.   Through  the CTR program, scientists
       at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory  (LASL)  and  elsewhere  are
       working toward developing a method to slow down this  energy release
       in a new type of nuclear reactor-the fusion reactor.

       A thermonuclear reaction  is  a "fusion" reaction whereby the nuclei
       of light atoms, such as hydrogen,  heavy  hydrogen  (deuterium), and
       lithium, are welded or fused together.  All present nuclear reactors
       operate by the "fission" process, which is the splitting  of  nuclei
       of heavy atoms  such  as uranium or plutonium into lighter elements,
       plus the release of energy.

       Also, large amounts  of  energy  are   released  during  the  fusion
       process.  This energy,  if  controlled,  can  be made  available  as
       electrical power or heat.

       The importance of  pursuing  this difficult goal is evident when one
       considers the limited supply of Earth's fossil fuels (coal, gas, and
       oil)  and commercial-grade  uranium   ores.    In  the  face  of  an
       increasing world energy demand, these conventional  fuels  may  last
       only another 50 to 400 years.

       By contrast, fusion reactors could be fueled with deuterium, a heavy
       isotope of hydrogen  that  is  available  in  common  seawater.  The
       energy potential from  the  deuterium   in  1  gallon  of  water  is
       equivalent to 300 gallons of gasoline.

       One cubic mile of water has the energy potential of  100,000 tons of
       uranium-235.  There is  sufficient  energy  in  the oceans to supply
       power for many future generations.

       The end product   of  fusion  is  helium,  which  is  harmless,  and
       neutrons, which are  readily  captured   within  the  reactor  core.
       Therefore, we would only have few of the radioactive  waste-disposal
       problems that are    common   to   fission-reactor   power   plants.
       Furthermore, because of the small  fuel inventory on hand, explosive
       accidents would not be possible in a fusion reactor.

       Research in controlled thermonuclear reactions was  started  at LASL
       in 1951, although  the  idea  had  been  discussed by LASL personnel
       during World War II days.

       To attain a power-producing thermonuclear reaction, one must produce
       temperatures over 50,000,000 degrees C and contain pressures of tons
       per square inch.   These  temperatures   and   pressures   must   be
       maintained for at least one-hundredth of a second.

       At thermonuclear temperatures, all matter exists  as  a  plasma.  (A
       plasma is a  gas composed of equal numbers of positive atomic nuclei
       and negative electrons, which at ordinary  temperatures  would unite
       to form neutral gas atoms and molecules.

       A form of  plasma  is  the  glow  in  a  household fluorescent  lamp
       fixture, for example.)   Because  a  plasma  is  a  good  electrical
       conductor, it can be held by magnetic forces.

       The deuterium plasma that is created  and studied in CTR experiments
       is usually confined by special magnetic field configurations, called
       "magnetic bottles."

       A major effort  of  mational research in CTR is concerned  with  the
       containment of plasma    in    toroidal-shaped   magnetic   bottles.
       Particular types of these plasma  bottles  are  the Tokamaks and the
       toroidal Z pinches.

       Toroidal Z pinches,  with  their  higher  currents,  can  be  heated
       ohmically, such as  in the manner of an electric toaster.  Tokamaks,
       the major world  effort  in toroidal  geometry,  use  other  heating
       methods.

       A major area  of  fusion  research  at  LASL  is a toroidal  Z-pinch
       experiment, which has  a  15-cm  bore and a 40-cm major radius.  The
       plasma has been heated to approximately  10,000,000 degrees C by the
       fast-rising magnetic field of a large toroidal (axial)  current that
       compresses, or pinches, the plasma.

       In practice, the pinched plasma is stabilized by a nearby conducting
       wall and a   strong   toroidal  magnetic  field  that  reverses  its
       direction on the outside of the pinch.   Future  experiments seek to
       extend the present 30-microsecond confinement of the hot plasma.

       A large toroidal Z-pinch experiment is now being designed  and built
       a LASL.  This  experiment,  called  ZT-40,  is about 10 times larger
       than the demonstration Z pinch.

       The ZT-40 will have controllable magnetic field systems capable of
       producing a reversed magnetic field  outside  the  pinch.   Reversed
       field pinches have  demonstrated  longer  lifetimes   than  ordinary
       pinches, and it  is expected that research information obtained from
       the ZT-40 experiment will put us one step further toward the

                     MAGNETIC FUSION RESEARCH IN CTR-DIVISION

       Thermonuclear fusion research  began  in the 1950's  in  the  United
       States, Great Britian  and the Soviet Union.  From the beginning Los
       Alamos made significant contributions to this research and continues
       to play an important role now.

       For example, the first successful laboratory experiments to produce
       thermonuclear reactions were done at Los Alamos in 1958.  During the
       1960's and 1970's  considerable progress  was  made  throughout  the
       world in magnetic confinement research.

       Today at Los  Alamos, the emphasis in magnetic confinement  research
       is on two concepts, the reversed field pinch and the compact toroid.
       Both of these  concepts have the potential for development as small,
       compact fusion reactors.

       The work in CTR-Division is part  of  the  national  magnetic fusion
       energy research program  to develop fusion energy  as  a  practical,
       economical energy resource.

                                      ZT-40M

       ZT-40M is a reversed field pinch experiment.  It has a toroidal, or
       donut-shaped, magnetic confinement geometry and uses strong electric
       currents in the  plasma  to produce some of the magnetic fields that
       confine the plasma.

       These currents also heat the plasma  just  as electric currents heat
       the wires in an electric toaster.  ZT-40M has produced hot plasma at
       temperatures between 3 and 4 million degrees Celsius.   The  plasmas
       are produced in   pulses  in  ZT-40M  which  last  about  20  to  25
       milliseconds.

                                   CTX-SPHEROMAK

       CTX is a  compact  toroid  experiment.    The   experiment  produces
       toroidally shaped plasmas,  just  as  in  ZT-40M  but   without  the
       toroidal vaccum vessel and magnetic coils surrounding the plasma.

       Instead, the confining  magnetic fields are generated principally by
       electric currents flowing within the  plasma itself, and the hole in
       the torus shrinks  to  produce a compact toriodal  shape.   CTX  has
       produced hot plasmas  at  temperatures  between  one and two million
       degrees Celsius, in pulses lasting one to two milliseconds.

                                       FRX-C

       FRX-C is another type of compact toroid experiment that produces

                                      Page 3





       prolate (tall, cigar-shaped)   toroidal  plasmas.   As  in  the  CTX
       Spheromak, FRX-C relies on internal  currents for confining magnetic
       fields.

       Temperatures as high  as  10  million  degrees  Celsius   have  been
       achieved in FRX-C.   Plasma  pulses  lasting  up to 300 microseconds
       have been produced.
