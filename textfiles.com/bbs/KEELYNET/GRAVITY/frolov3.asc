This file refers to electro-gravitation based on the research of T.T. Brown.
You might also find the file STOWGRAD of interest because Paul says a gradient
field can be generated to produce lift or propulsion.

Jerry...I thought you'd appreciate this message.  It's from a guy in Russia
who is working on an electrogravitic disc, much like T.T. Brown.  Also, he
explains the principle...I thought you could contact him and maybe put it on
Keelynet.

Dear Sirs,

Did you see T. T. Brown's patent USA 3,187,206 Electrokinetic apparatus,
June 1, 1965?

Look at Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7. The idea is THE ASYMMETRY for electric
potential field. Before I saw these Figures I prepared own patents on it, but
now it is clear that I invented old news of 1965.

So, what is a "dielectric body form" that produces motion in an electrostatic
device.

                                     I---------------------->  positive
Look at the Figure here:       ______I_______
                            /I I            I I\
                          /  I I            I I  \
                        /    I I            I I    \
                      /      I I            I I      \
                    /        I I   opened   I I        \
                  /dielectricI I  cylinder  I Idielectric\
                /____________I I            I I____________\
                ______________                ______________
                  ring                            ring      I----------->
                                                                 negative

A Positive charged cylinder and a Negative charged ring are two plates forming
a simple asymmetrical capacitor. Forces from the ring to the cylinder are
perpendicular to its surface and the sum of forces is equal to zero.

Forces from the cylinder to the ring are perpendicular to the ring and its sum
is not equal to zero.  This Asymmetrical capacitor moves upwards in this
diagram.

The T.T.Brown version used an asymmetrical form for the dielectric body like
this:

                           ----------------- positive plate
                                 ____
                                /    \
                              /        \
                            /____________\

                         --------------------- negative plate

It is a cross-section of the dielectric body, where the view is from the butt-
end.

It is clear that forces are asymmetrical here since the lines of the
electrical field are curved. Let's try show it here:

                       metal plate of capacitor /positive/
            . ------.-------.-------.---------.-.-.-.-
            .       .       .       .        _._._._._
                     .        .       .     /
             .         .        .        ./
                         .         .    /
                           .          /
                 .            .     /
                                 ./
                                /       dielectric body
                       .      /
                            /
                          /__________________________________
              ------------------------------------------------
                                   metal plate of capacitor /negative/

The rule is that the line of field is always perpendicular to the surface. The
asymmetric pattern is necessary to develop the forces here.

I am ready for joint experimental work or patent work in this direction if you
can offer some help in funds for equipment for it. Please, contact my partner
for discussion of conditions:

                  David Rogers / rogersda@direct.ca /

The calculations I made show that 1000 Volts can create force of several Kg
for a capacitor 1 m diameter. It is defined by the distance between plates and
by the material of the dielectric.

Microtechnology that can create submilimeter size shapes for the dielectric
decribed above which will allow it to be built and tested.

IF YOU WISH TO CARRY OUT THIS EXPERIMENT AND BUILD A REAL ELECTROGRAVITY
MACHINE, PLEASE CONTACT ME OR DAVID ROGERS.
