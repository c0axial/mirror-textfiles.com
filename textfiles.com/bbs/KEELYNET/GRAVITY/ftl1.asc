                             Through the Light Barrier
                                   by Bob Jones

       Those who are  interested in the prospects of interstellar flight on
       some really meaningful scale find  the  so-called  "light barrier" a
       bitter pill to swallow.

       According to most physicists, it would not be possible for a ship to
       reach the velocity of light because the closer it got  to  achieving
       light velocities, the more massive it would become.

       According to them  you  would  never  be  able  to  beat  that  last
       fraction.  The whole thing is based  on  the  proven  fact  that the
       faster an object travels, the more massive it becomes  (due  to  the
       energy (speed) being converted to matter/mass...Vangard).

       The proof comes  from  tests  with electrons that are accelerated to
       near light speeds by electrostatic forces.

       They do indeed BECOME HEAVIER and in just the amount predicted!  The
       forces for making  these electrons  accelerate  came  from  outside,
       however.

       In the case of a space ship these accelerating forces will come from
       within.  Anything that happens to the ship will also  happen  to the
       reaction mass (all the mass around the ship).

       As a ship  nears  the  speed of light it will become noticeably MORE
       MASSIVE BUT SO WILL THE FUEL.   That  means  that  as  the  ship  is
       becoming more massive the thrust is becoming higher  too,  since the
       exhaust is more  massive  (heavier particles due to denser mass from
       the energy to mass conversion)!

       These two effects will of course occur in direct proportion with the
       acceleration remaining constant DESPITE THE SPEED.  We must remember
       that when a factor enters into a problem  due to speed we cannot try
       to change this speed from the outside THE SAME as from within.

       The faster the motion the greater the difference and  here  there is
       all the difference in the world!

       For those who  are  interested,  the  1958  Nobel Prize was won by 3
       Russians for discovering that the so-called Cerenkov Radiation moved
       FASTER THAN LIGHT!

       Vangard note...

           We should  include  the  concept  of TACHYONS, which are faster-
           than-light particles.  Who is  to  say  that  ALL MASS cannot be
           accelerated to greater than the speed of light.

           It follows that a mass moving AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT,  as  viewed
           from a stationary point would BE PERCEIVED AS LIGHT!

           It also follows that a mass could be accelerated to the speed of
           light (and  beyond),  yet  REMAIN STATIONARY.  What would be the
           effects, depending on the speed,  the  mass would either radiate
           at a  specific  color  or  become  invisible  as   it   achieved
           frequencies which are NOT VISIBLE to the human eye.

           Again we   have  indications  of  Philadelphia  Experiment  type
           possibilities since the reason  for  that project was to achieve
           practical invisibility.  There are arguments  that  the  process
           was intended  to acheive RADAR INVISIBILTY and had nothing to do
           with the masking of visible frequencies.
