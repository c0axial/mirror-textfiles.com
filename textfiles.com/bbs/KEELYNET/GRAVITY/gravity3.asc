       |        Gravity Resonance? What is this nut talking about?????    |
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       You are probably thinking, "how can gravity possibly be resonant?"

       This is a  good  question.  As  discovered by Thomas Townsend Brown,
       electricity is directly related to  gravity  (see  his  U.S. patents
       1,974,483, 3,187,206 in particular.)

       If this is so, it is most likely a vectorial relationship (law of
       opposites), and since there is already an electromagnetic vector (2
       dimensional), a gravitational vector would be at 90  degrees to both
       the magnetic and   the  electric  vectors  (since  we  are  in  a  3
       dimensional space.)

       The gravitational vector is like  the  "duration  in  time"  of  the
       electric and magnetic vectors. There are also, in addition to scalar
       electric and magnetic waves

              (see Bearden, Thomas E. "Toward a new electromagnetics:
                   part IV:  vectors and mechanisms clarified.  Tesla  Book
                   Co., Millbrae, California, 1983.

       This work, however, fails to mention gravity waves, although it does
       mention controlling gravity), there are also scalar gravitic waves

                   the Aharanov-Bohm  effect."   Journal   of   Physics  A.

       |                 Okay.  So There are gravity waves.               |
       |              How can resonating them control reality?            |
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

              All of  the  above  has  been proven; this is where basically
       theory comes in.  There has been much supposed experimental proof of
       these effects, however  all  current   research  is,  unfortunately,
       proprietary, and it is extremely hard to come by anything helpful.

              The only  good  sources of information are  some  small  mail
       order book stores, and no one store has everything.

              One example   of   publicized   experimental   proof  is  the
       information regarding the  largely  ignored  Biefield-Brown  effect,
       whereby gravity can be nullified and even reversed  due  to electric
       charge

              (see Thomas Townsend Brown, Above patents), and the book on
                   the Philadelphia  experiment  (and  NOT  THE  MOVIE! The
                   movie was fiction, the  book  is  an  attempt to analyze
                   what little fact is known.)

              The true  Philadelphia  experiment, if it actually  occurred,
       used a Navy  ship degausser modified to act as some type of resonant
       gravity vector coil.

              The actual  theory  is  that,   since   electricity   can  be
       "transmitted" through the ether through electric scalar  and  vector
       waves, and magnetic energy through magnetic scalar and vector waves,
       why not gravitational scalar and vector waves, if they do exist (law
       of opposites)?

              A gravity  wave  is  the temporal "shape" of the electric and
       magnetic vector (I  hope  this  is  a  good  explanation!),  and  by
       changing this shape you are changing the molecular  construction  of
       the matter (or lack thereof) transmitting the waves.

             Also, since  there  are  an  infinite number of parallel, real
       universes

              (see Hypernumbers II, by Charles Muses, January 1978
                   "Applied Mathematics    and    Computation",   and   his
                   introduction to Jerome Rothstein's "Communication,
                   Organization, and  Science,"  The Falcon's  Wing  Press,
                   Indian Hills, CO, 1958),

       the gravity vector    coil    MAY    allow   the   psychic   (scalar
       electromagnetic brain wave) postulation  of  reality  through the G-
       vector. Thisÿcould also be done with a computer, but both are beyond
       the scope of this paper.

              I will now present the plans for the construction of a simple
       G-vector coil. What you do with it from here is up to you, show it

                                      Page 2





       to your physics  teachers  and  have them look up the references and
       watch their eyes pop as they find out the speed of light is NOT
       constant.

            This, actually, is the hardest  part.  You  will either have to
       spend a lot of $$$ at a plastics company or have some  good  friends
       to get but  one  of  the  parts  needed, the others should be fairly
       easy.

            Listed in order of availability

            (2) 50 VDC (DC-10 MHZ preferred,  but...)  @ 10A, 50KV isolated
                power supplies

            (1) Case to put it all in

            about 7500 feet of #16 Guage heavy Formvar magnetwire

            a lot (probably 5000 feet) of #20 or #22 magnetwire

            some fiberglass tape

            some plastic tape

            TV HV corona dope

       And, the clincher:

            (1) Hollow plastic dia., about 30"-32" outside diameter, 24-26"
                inner diameter, and about 4"-6" thick.

                                      Page 3





                It must be hollow, thermosetting plastic, with supports for
                an internal  coil  of  wire,  and two holes for the wire to
                leave, spaced to avoid electrical discharges.

                It must be boiling wax-tight, preferrably with a gasket.

                And it should be openable,  at  least into 4 sections, with
                screwholes (and gaskets if available.)

                You also  need enough of equal portions of  Carnubura  (sp)
                beeswax, and paraffin wax to fill the inside.

       (1) Wind a  28"  (about,  must  center inside the hollow part of the
                      plastic donut) "hoop"  coil  of  the  #16 magnetwire.
                      (see Illustration 1)

       (2) Wrap first with fiberglass and then plastic tape,  and  then dip
                      it in TV HV corona dope. Allow to dry.

       (3) Place the coil inside the hollow donut.

       (4) Seal the  donut,  allowing  an  opening for the wax to be poured
                      into.

       (5) Pour the wax into the donut,  leaving  as  little  air  space as
                      possible.

       (6) Seal the donut, adding any extra wax.

       (7) Wrap approximately one layer of the #20 or #22  guage magnetwire
                      over the outside of the donut.

       (8) Coat with HV corona dope.

       (9) You are  finished  with  the  coil.  It  should  look similar to
                      illustration 2.

            The polarity, at this stage, does not matter.

            Next, connect the leads from the outer coil to the other 50 VDC
       power supply.

            Do NOT turn either of them on! Now, connect one of the leads of
       the inner coil  to  one  terminal of the 25-100 KV power supply, and
       connect one lead of the outer coil  to the other terminal of the 25-
       100 KV power supply.

            Thats it!

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

            Now, the hard part. You will have to figure  out  some  way  of
       modulating the fields.  This  could  be  done  through stepper motor
       control of the variac, or through  the  insertion  of  a  probe coil
       (probably just a  ferrite  rod wrapped with a few hundred  turns  of
       wire) into the center of the donut hole.

            This would  then  be  modulated  with  whatever electromagnetic
       signal you'd want to impress upon the field.

            Through careful experimentation,  you should be able to produce
       some very interesting effects, such as extreme gravity,  bending  of
       metal within the field, spontaneous materialization of ?, etc.

            Note that  the  purpose  of  the  wax  is  to  act  as a molten
       dielectric, so don't be surprised when it starts boiling.

            Thats why the donut form must  be made out of thermosetting (or
       any kind that  doesn't  melt near the temperature  of  boiling  wax)
       plastic.

            Have phun,  and don't do anything you wouldn't want perpetuated
       throughout your subjective reality!

       There are two modifications to the  above  device  which should make
       the effect of the unit more powerful, while at the  same time making
       it more safe for the operator to conduct his/her research.

       1.  In place  of  the  wax  in  the  coil  being  used  as a "molten
           dielectric", it would be advantageous to use Glycerine instead.

           The "scorch field" set up between the two coils using the 25-

                                      Page 7





           100kvdc supply  will  be  approx.  25 times greater in intensity
           than with the wax.

           While the dielectric constant (k) of wax is less than 3, the (k)
           of Glycerine is about 56.

           Also, the semi-liquid state that  Glycerine  maintains  at  room
           temperature will  prove  to  be an effective heat-sink  for  the
           inner coil.  Glycerine is an emollient, and can be obtained from
           most drug stores.

       2.  The Modulator  coil (250-300 turns) on ferrite core to be placed
           into the interior of the coil shall be replaced by a coil larger
           in diameter than the outer coil  of  the present unit (as herein
           described) and shall be placed outside the units' outer coil.

           This will   give  a  more  stable  field  configuration,   while
           confining the  gravitational  effects  to  the  interior  of the
           device.

           These two modifications, while increasing the units' power, will
           also provide a level of safety  not  to  be  had in the original
           design.

       A word of caution! --------

           While operating this device, it would be wise to  secure  a non-
           interruptable power supply for it.

           If, while  the fields were at their maximum output, the power to
           the coils  were  to  be suddenly  interrupted,  a  very  serious
           condition could  arise  as  the  distorted region  of  spacetime
           surrounding the  coil "cut-loose" into the surrounding spacetime
           beyond the coils influence.

           A "pulse" of distorted spacetime  might, under these conditions,
           leave the coil at high velocity, and inflict great damage to the
           surroundings near the coil.  (Including the operator)
