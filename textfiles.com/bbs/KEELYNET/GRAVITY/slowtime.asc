                       Experiment on Time Dialation Effects
                 Reported to Occur With High Speed Rotating Masses

                     Conducted by Norman Wootan and Bert Pool

       Hal Fox, editor of Fusion Facts, invited interested experimenters
       to verify or refute a report that  large  spinning masses apparently
       may affect time/space  in  the immediate vicinity  of  the  spinning
       mass.

       Back in the   1960's,  an  unnamed  experimenter  reported  that  an
       "Accutron" quartz movement watch would  lose time at a rate of about
       19 seconds for  every 1,000 seconds of "near exposure"  to  a  large
       spinning mass such as a large generator rotor.

       We had no  exact  description  of  the  spinning mass except that it
       probably was steel or laminated iron  -  and  we  had no exact rotor
       weight from which to work.

       Physicists theorize that  extremely massive objects  such  as  black
       holes can affect  time  in  their  immediate vicinity - could a much
       smaller spinning mass also produce a measurable slowdown in time?

       Norm Wootan and I (Bert Pool) decided to conduct an experiment which
       would help prove or disprove the alleged observation.

       During the months  of  December  1993   and  January  1994,  several
       experiments were conducted  using  fairly  large  spinning   masses.
       Below is a description of the test apparatus used and the results
       observed.

       First, a test  device was constructed using an aluminum test mass of
       31 pounds of aluminum disks stacked  to  form  a  rotor  8 inches in
       diameter and 6 inches tall.  The disks which were used  to  form the
       rotating cylinder were  precision  aluminum  computer  disk platters
       removed from surplus mainframe hard  disk drives.  The thin magnetic
       oxide was left intact on the platters.  The surplus  hard disk drive
       spindle provided an  ideal  bearing  which could handle the mass and
       speed we were to attempt in the experiments.


                                      Page 1





       Since we had  the  aluminum  disks ready-made, we decided to run our
       tests with aluminum instead of steel for the mass.

       Two quartz crystal controlled timebases  were  carefully  chosen  to
       form a "test timebase" and a "reference timebase".  Both were sealed
       in solid copper foil Faraday shields to isolate the  time bases from
       external electromagnetic fields.

       One timebase designated as the "test base" was placed 1/32 inch away
       from the edge of the spinning mass.

       The second timebase,  referred to as the "reference base" was placed
       in a secure area ten feet away from  the  spinning  mass.   Care was
       made to insure  that the reference timebase was at  least  ten  feet
       away from all  external  sources of moving mass or electrostatic and
       electromagnetic fields.

       Previous testing had verified that  the  two  timebases would remain
       synchronized to better  than  1/4  second per 48 hour  test  period.
       This degree of  synchronization  is  equal  to better than 1 part in
       691,000.  Since we were looking  for  a  reported  slowdown  of  the
       affected timebase on the order of 19 seconds in 1000,  or  1 part in
       52, this would   provide   us  with  more  than  adequate  measuring
       accuracy.

       The 31 pound aluminum cylinder was  spun  up  to  a  speed  of 3,090
       r.p.m..  For the first test, both timebases were  placed  in  copper
       shielding.  The mass ran for 45 minutes, or 2,700 seconds.

       The expected slowdown  of  the  timebase near the spinning rotor was
       postulated to be as much as 51.3 seconds (1/52 of 2,700 seconds).
       The spinning mass was stopped and both the reference timebase and
       the test timebase were removed from  their Faraday shielding and the
       displayed times carefully compared.

       Absolutely NO loss of time was found to have occurred  in  the  test
       timebase compared to the reference base.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       A second test  was run using UNSHIELDED timebases.  We expected that
       the magnetic oxide coating on the  platters  might interact with the
       electronics of the test timebase.  This time, the  mass  was  run at
       3,090 r.p.m. for 12 hours!

       At the end  of  the  test  period,  the  mass  was  stopped, and the
       timebases were again compared.   Absolutely  NO  loss  of  time  was
       measured in the test timebase.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       We decided that  perhaps  the  mass  and  inertia of  the  31  pound
       cylinder were not high enough.  We set up the experiment again using
       shielded timebases, but  replaced the 31 pound, 8 inch diameter mass
       with one which was 14 inches in  diameter  and  over  66  pounds  in
       weight.

       The driving motor  was  replaced  with one twice  the  size  of  the
       original.  The mass  was  spun up to a maximum speed of 3,200 r.p.m.
       (this was the maximum speed we could coax out of the motor with this
       large load) and ran the experiment for 1 hour.

       The mass was stopped, and the timebases examined.  As before,

                                      Page 2





       absolutely NO loss  of  time was observed in the test timebase which
       had been placed near the spinning mass.

       Two additional timebases placed INSIDE of the spinning mass, near
       the outer circumference  of the platters,  also  did  not  show  any
       unusual time discrepancies whatsoever.

       Conclusions:   Shielded accurate   quartz   controlled    oscillator
                      timebases are  not affected whatsoever when placed in
                      very close proximity to large spinning masses of non-
                      magnetic aluminum.    Even   non-shielded   timebases
                      showed remarkable stability over extended periods of
                      measurement in the experiment.

       We plan on  conducting  additional experiments in the  near  future,
       using a larger rotor machined from steel instead of aluminum.

       We believe that  the  reported  anomaly  was  most likely due to the
       interaction of residual magnetic  fields  present  in  the  original
       steel rotating mass interacting with the electronics  or tuning fork
       within the original "Acutron" watch placed near the mass.

       During our experiment  we  may not have observed an effect showing a
       measurable slowdown of time in our experiment because

            (1) the effect may only occur with steel or other ferrous metal
                rotors,
            (2) our mass may have been insufficient,
            (3) our rotor speed may have  been  too  low,   or perhaps some
                combination of the above, or
            (4) there very well may be no measurable effect on time by a
                spinning mass  constructed  of  any  material,   i.e.   the
                original observation was flawed or bogus.

       It is suggested   that   other  researchers  experiment  with  large
       spinning masses to help determine  whether  in  fact spinning masses
       can affect the  flow of time in space near the spinning  mass.   Our
       initial tests lead  us  to  believe  that  no  such effect is taking
       place.

       Vangard Note

           An excellent  experiment and  report,  despite  the  failure  to
           detect the reported time loss, the attempt is worthy  of  report
           and congratulations.  We look forward to additional experiments.
                               Thanks Bert and Norm!
