          An artificial  satellite  is  a  manmade  "moon."  It circles the
       Earth in space along a path called an orbit. An artificial satellite
       may be designed in almost any shape such as a ball, drum, or box.

          It does not have to be streamlined  because there is little or no
       air where it  travels.   Most  satellites measure only  a  few  feet
       across; some, such  as  Echo  balloons,  may  be 100 feet or more in
       diameter.  A satellite's size and shape depend on its purpose.

          Artificial satellites stay in space  for varying lengths of time.
       The lifetime of each satellite depends on its size and distance from
       Earth.

          When a satellite swings close to Earth, it runs  into  air  which
       slows it. To  stay  in  orbit,  a  satellite must maintain a certain
       speed.

          If it slows below this speed, it  plunges into the atmosphere and
       burns due to friction. The gradual slowing of a satellite  by air is
       called decay.

          Large, light  satellites  in  low  orbits  decay rapidly.  Small,
       heavy ones in high orbits decay  slowly.  The  six  inch  Vanguard I
       orbits more than  400  miles  above  the Earth and  will  orbit  for
       hundreds of years.

          Every satellite  carries some kind of radio transmitter. One kind
       is called a radio beacon which sends  signals  that enable engineers
       to track the satellite.

          Another kind of transmitter sends scientific information gathered
       by the satellite's  instruments.  This  sending  of  information  is
       called telemetry.

          Some satellites  carry  equipment  to  receive signals. Engineers
       beam signals to these satellites to turn the instruments on and off.

          Most satellites stop functioning  long before they fall to Earth.
       Their batteries go dead, or their electronic equipment  breaks down.
       They become "silent"   and  are  of  no  further  use.  Many  silent
       satellites are circling the Earth.

          Artificial satellites  may  be   classified  according  to  their
       purpose: weather, communication,    navigation,   earth    resource,
       scientific, or military satellites.

          Weather, or   meteorological,   satellites   help  scientists  to
       forecast and study weather. The first of these was called TIROS.

          These satellites carry television  cameras  that take pictures of
       the Earth's surface  showing  how  the  clouds  move   through   the
       atmosphere.  They also  show snow and ice. By studying the pictures,
       weathermen can discover and inform  people  of  approaching  weather
       conditions.

          Communication satellites make it possible to send radio messages,
       telephone calls, and television programs between distant parts of
       Earth. These satellites  are classified passive or active  depending
       on the way they operate.

          Passive communication satellites act as a mirror for radio waves.
       A sending station  on  Earth beams waves to the satellite, the waves
       bounce off the satellite, and return to Earth.

          They reach a receiving station  perhaps  thousands  of miles from
       the sending station. Active satellites receive signals from sending
       stations, amplify them, and send them back to Earth.

          Navigation satellites help pilots and sailors  find  their  exact
       positions in all  kinds  of  weather.  Navigators can use it to find
       their position much as they would use a star. But instead of looking
       at the satellite, they listen to its radio signals.

          Resource satellites  are  used   to   monitor   Earth's   natural
       resources.  This series  include  such  satellites  as  Landsat  and
       Seasat.  Scientific satellites carry a variety of instruments around
       the world.

          Some instruments  measure  radiation;  other  instruments  called
       magnetometers measure the Earth's  magnetic  field.  Satellites that
       explore the upper  parts  of the atmosphere by beaming  radio  waves
       down into the  atmosphere and then measure the reflected signals are
       called topside sounders.

          Orbiting observatories are the  largest  and  most complicated of
       the scientific satellites.  The U.S. uses three types:  geophysical,
       solar, and astronomical.   The   orbiting   geophysical  observatory
       explores space near Earth, and scientists  use  it  to study how the
       Earth's magnetic field affects energy coming from the sun.

          The orbiting  solar  observatory  studies  the sun  by  measuring
       radiation that cannot   get  through  the  Earth's  atmosphere.  The
       orbiting astronomical observatory looks deep into space at stars and
       galaxies measuring rays that never reach Earth.

          The U.S.  builds  and  launches  some  scientific  satellites  in
       cooperation with other countries. The first international satellite,
       Ariel, carried instruments built by British scientists. The topsider
       sounder, Alouette, was designed and built by Canadian  engineers and
       launched by the U.S.

          Military satellites are used for communication and navigation.
       Reconnaissance satellites can photograph enemy ground forces.

          Warning satellites can guard against surprised missile attacks.

       They can discover  a  missile  launch  by  measuring the heat of the
       missile rocket exhaust.  Since   1963,   the   U.S.  has  kept  Vela
       satellites in space to detect any "sneak testing" of  nuclear  bombs
       in space by other nations.
