                                  The Higgs Field

       Title->     Armies of physicists struggle to discover proof of a
                   Scot's brainchild.. (Peter Higgs; Higgs boson) (study of
                   mass and the cause of heaviness)

       Authors->   Mann, Charles C.

       Twenty men in   boots  and  hard  hats  pick  their  way  through  a
       construction site a  few  hundred  yards  from  the  border  between
       Switzerland and France.

       The morning is  hot and dry for May, but the ground  is  nonetheless
       muddy from the  continued  movement  of  bulldozers and trucks.  The
       center of activity  is  a  vast  hangarlike   structure   or,   more
       precisely, the pit at its center, more than 30 yards deep and almost
       as wide, cut into the soft French soil.

       A tall, stoop-shouldered  man  named  Samuel C. C.  Ting  leads  the
       group.  He is  a  physicist  from  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of
       Technology, a Nobel Prize winner.  He wears dark suits, immaculately
       clean, of no particular style, and  dark ties, perfectly knotted, of
       no particular hue.   Authority rests lightly on his  shoulders.   He
       and the people  walking behind him are working on a colossal physics
       experiment; they come from China,  the  United  States  and  a dozen
       other countries.

       Known unromantically as  L3,  the experiment is designed  to  answer
       what would appear to be a fundamental question:

              Why are things heavy?
              Why, in a gravitational field, do they have weight?

       Or, as physicists would phrase the question: What is mass?

       We think mass  is  created  by  the  actions  of a type of subatomic
       particle known as  the  Higgs boson,  named  for  Peter  Higgs,  the
       Scottish physicist who  was  one  of  the  first  to   predict   its
       existence.  Yet scientists  have  never seen it, and are not certain
       where to look.

                                      Page 1





       Ting thinks his experiment can find the Higgs, if it exists.  He may
       discover it, which   could   ultimately   prove  as  significant  an
       achievement as splitting the atom.   Then,  too, the discovery might
       just as well have no practical consequences.  Or, the  Higgs may not
       exist, after all.

       The wind, keening in the open struts of the elevator, follows the
       scientists into the hole.  Because nearby residents objected to the
       ugliness of the  construction,  an  earthen  berm stands between the
       hangar and the surrounding farms.

       As the car descends, the berm sweeps  out  of  view;  then  the Jura
       Mountains, too, are  hidden.  By the end of the elevator  ride,  the
       scientists have journeyed into a world of their own making.  It is a
       world some of  them  have  never  seen, despite having worked on the
       experiment for years.  Then, when  the  elevator finally stops, jaws
       drop and a silence falls over the group.

       Standing in the  center  of the pit is an octagon  the  size  of  an
       office building, its  huge  side  doors  yawning  open.   It  is  an
       electromagnet, made of more metal  than the Eiffel Tower, wound with
       hundreds of miles of cable.

       Some of the scientists are startled, even dismayed,  by  what is not
       there: the thousands  of tons of equipment that remain to be stuffed
       into the pit.  The magnet and all  the  apparatus  that goes with it
       together constitute the heart of L3 - the detector  that  may,  just
       may, come up with the Higgs boson.

       "When we first  put  the  plans for this experiment down on paper, I
       knew the dimensions were big," Ting says at last.  Usually his voice
       is toneless, careful,  without  edge  even  when  administering  the
       sharpest rebuke; you   keep  thinking  you  have  missed   bits   of
       sentences.  Now, however,  he  hesitates"But it isn't til you see it
       that you get a feeling for how .  .  .  big .  .  .  it really is. I
       went down here a couple of days ago  and I thought, 'This is crazy.'
       I thought, 'It can't be this size."'

       Seeking an answer  better than Aristotle's "Why are  things  heavy?"
       Artistotle thought objects are pulled to earth because they wish to
       return to it,  and for much of Western history nobody came up with a
       better explanation.

       It was left for Kepler, Newton and  their  fellows  to  realize that
       heaviness came from  the  interaction  of  gravity with  some  other
       quality, which we  today call "mass." It is the quality of an object
       that causes it to have inertia: that  means you have to use force to
       get it moving if it is standing still, and you have to use force to
       stop it if it is already moving.

       You must use force whether you are on the surface  of  a  planet  or
       floating weightless between  the stars.  Mass is a quality an object
       always has; it is different from  weight,  which  changes,  or  even
       disappears, with changing circumstances.

       Take an astronaut who, when he is on Earth, weighs  180 pounds.  The
       moon's gravitational field  is  only one-sixth as strong as Earth's,
       so when that same astronaut is standing on the moon, he will feel he
       only weighs one-sixth as much.

                                      Page 2





       When he is  in free-fall in a spacecraft, we say he is "weightless."
       His mass, however, is always the same 180 pounds.

       Well into this century, physicists knew a lot about how mass behaved
       but did not know whence it derived or, more simply, what it was.

       "Mass is the great question of physics," says Abdus Salam, a Nobel
       Prize-winning physicist who is director  of the International Centre
       for Theoretical Physics at Trieste.  "We have fruitlessly banged our
       heads against it for centuries."

       Today the search for the origins of mass has become,  to  the dismay
       of some researchers, one of the largest and most costly undertakings
       in the history of science.  On both sides of the Atlantic, thousands
       of scientists and  support  staff  are working to build the enormous
       machines that will be used in the  quest.   The L3 group, led by 450
       physicists from 39  institutions,  is  but  one  of  six  groups  of
       experimenters hoping to solve the mystery of mass.

       The quest began,   at  least  indirectly,  during  the  1950s,  when
       physicists first began to work out  their  grand  unified  theories,
       schemes in which  the  four fundamental forces in  nature  are  only
       different manifestations of one and the same thing (SMITHSONIAN, May
       1983).

       Part of the  idea  is  that  each  force  has  an agent, a subatomic
       particle, that produces  the  effects   we   see.   They  are  known
       collectively as GAUGE BOSONS.

       Photons, for example, "carry" the electromagnetic force,  whether in
       the form of  light  waves,  radio waves, x rays or gamma rays, among
       others.  Mesons carry the strong force  that holds the nucleus of an
       atom together.

       Scientists still have  not seen gravitons, the particles  postulated
       to carry gravity;  and  until recently, physicists had not even seen
       the particlcs, known as intermediate  vector  bosons  or the W and Z
       particles, that carry the weak force, an obscure  force  central  to
       the process of radioactive decay.

       It was in the atmosphere of looking for unification theories that
       physicists such as  Salam  and  Sheldon  Glashow,  now  of  Harvard,
       working independently, were    toying    with    the    idea    that
       electromagnetism and the  weak force could be brought  together  and
       seen as different  manifestations  of the same thing-the electroweak
       force.

       In the late 1950s, Glashow and Salam developed similar theories, but
       hit the same stumbling block: while  much of the mathematics in each
       theory worked, there were major discrepancies between  the particles
       that carried the forces.

       Photons have no  mass  at  all;  but  even before they were actually
       seen, W and Z particles were predicted  to  be  heavy  - very heavy.
       (Many physicists had calculated their mass and had  eventually  come
       up with a  similar ballpark figure.  Each W or Z weighs more than 80
       times what an entire hydrogen atom does.)

       Yet the equations of Glashow and Salam said that on some deeper

                                      Page 3





       level, the Ws  and  Zs  should  have no mass, like their sibling the
       photon.  "It was a problem," Glashow  has  admitted.   "It was a bit
       like saying a Ping-Pong ball and a bowling ball are somehow the
       same thing."

       By the early 1960s, Glashow had begun to look into other areas of
       physics, but his  childhood  friend  Steven  Weinberg,  now  at  the
       University of Texas,  and  Salam each continued looking for a way to
       describe the two forces as one.

       At the same  time, a Scottish theorist,  Peter  Higgs,  was  at  the
       University of Edinburgh working on a somewhat related  problem.  For
       several years the  shy,  soft-spoken,  excessively  modest Higgs had
       been investigating various aspects  of  field  theory,  which is the
       notion that all of space is saturated by a field, much  as the field
       of a magnet saturates the region near it.

       Like the field of a magnet, the hypothetical field Higgs created had
       ephemeral particles that  acted as its agents: these eventually came
       to be known as "Higgs bosons."

       Higgs had been engaged in intense doodling, fiddling with equations,
       adding in one variable and taking  out  another  to learn more about
       the nature of his hypothetical field.  It was at this  point, around
       1964, that he noticed something extraordinary.

       If he added  in  his own field equations (and thus the Higgs bosons)
       to equations somewhat analogous to  those  of  Salam  or Glashow, he
       found that certain particles in the original equation  behaved in an
       astonishing fashion.

       They began with zero mass and then mathematically "ate up"
       other, unwanted particles in the field (ones that had made a mess of
       the mathematics in  the  theory  he was investigating) emerging with
       mass.' (The unknown  particles   turned  out  to  be  the  W  and  Z
       particles, but Higgs did not know that at the time.)

       Higgs published his   findings   -  described  by   Glashow   as   a
       "terrifically loony idea: an idea that nobody would ever have paid
       attention to" - with little fanfare.  Eventually, Salam and Weinberg
       independently heard about his work and realized it might solve their
       problem.

       Each added Higgs'  equations  into the ones they had been working on
       and - to  their  great  delight -  found  that  the  particles  that
       acquired mass in  Higgs  equations  corresponded  to  the  W  and  Z
       particles in their  own.   Higgs'  hypothetical  boson  provided the
       mechanism by which the electromagnetic and weak forces could finally
       be seen as one.

       Higgs bosons might have been entirely  forgotten if a groundswell of
       theoretical and experimental work in the 1970s had  not  led  to the
       acceptance of the  electroweak  theory  -  and  to  Nobel Prizes for
       Glashow, Salam and Weinberg in 1979.

       Four years later the W and Z were  discovered by a team led by Carlo
       Rubbia and Simon van der Meer, who quickly received Nobels for their
       efforts.  Today the electroweak theory is inscribed in the


                                      Page 4





       textbooks, except for  one not-so-little worry: nobody has seen even
       the slightest trace of the Higgs.

       "And without the Higgs," jokes Paul Lecoq, a French member of the L3
       collaboration, "Messrs.  Glashow,  Weinberg and Salam may eventually
       have to give back those little prizes they got in Sweden."

       In a long, high laboratory, Ulrich Becker wedges his way through a
       forest of electronic equipment and the cables and welding equipment
       necessary to hook it together.  A big man with the  square  face and
       wiry, stand-up hair  of  a  friendly monster, Becker has been one of
       Ting's chief collaborators for two decades.

       Born and raised in the Federal Republic  of  Germany,  he  is  now a
       member of the international fraternity of science:  citizen  of West
       Germany, resident of  France, worker in Switzerland, taxpayer of the
       United States.  Like Ting, he is  officially  on  the faculty of MIT
       but, like Ting, he has spent the past decade traveling  the globe in
       quest of the Higgs.

       "Put naively," Becker says "most of the progress in particle physics
       for the past  20 years, this electroweak theory and everything else,
       depends on the supposition - the guess  -  that there is this field,
       the Higgs field,  that  saturates  the  whole  Universe,   and  that
       particles get their mass from interacting with it.

       You might say  it's a little like a magnet, with some kinds of metal
       being more attracted   than  others.   Particles   that   are   more
       'attracted' to the Higgs have more mass.  The picture  is very nice,
       theoretically speaking - yet there 'is not one shred of evidence for
       it."

       Ting's L3 group is based at the European Organization for Nuclear
       Research, still known  to  physicists  around  the  world by its old
       acronym, CERN.  The main campus is  in  a  suburb of Geneva, but the
       laboratory has grown with physics itself: the L3 assembly area is in
       France, a few miles from the Swiss border.  (Customs  is  a constant
       problem; recently, Becker  recalls,  he had to cross the frontier 12
       times in a single afternoon; the  border  guard  threatened to seize
       his car if he came through again that day.)

       A great circular  tunnel  connects the campus and  the  L3  pit;  it
       houses an almost  completed particle accelerator called the LEP, the
       Large Electron-Positron collider.

       Accelerators are devices  that  smash  subatomic  particles  into  a
       target or into one another with enormous energy;  in  the  resultant
       collisions, matter changes  into  energy and energy into matter, and
       the flying fragments provide clues to the laws of nature.

       They are usually built in the shape  of  a  wheel; as particles move
       around the circumference,  they  are  boosted to higher  and  higher
       speeds by powerful electric fields.

       Electrons, which at  rest  are very light, can be pushed to within a
       whisker of the  speed  of  light.    At  such  relativistic  speeds,
       however, the electron becomes heavy and difficult  to  turn  in  the
       necessary continuous circle.


                                      Page 5





       It takes huge  amounts  of electrical power to keep bending the beam
       of electrons, which keep losing energy in the form of x rays as they
       are forced to  turn.  To smooth out  the  turns,  accelerators  have
       become bigger and  bigger  around,  not  to mention  more  and  more
       costly.  The old   proton   accelerator   at   Brookhaven   National
       Laboratory on New York's Long Island is just half a mile around, the
       main accelerator ring at the Fermi  National  Accelerator Laboratory
       in Batavia, Illinois, is nearly 4 miles around.

       The LEP in Geneva, when it is commissioned in July, will be 17 miles
       around; the largest in the world.  Someday it may be eclipsed in its
       turn by the  planned Superconducting Super Collider  (SSC)  in  West
       Texas, which will have a circumference of about 53 miles - and which
       some investigators think  may  ultimately  have  the  best chance of
       finding the Higgs.

       The LEP will achieve extraordinary energy levels in two ways. First,
       instead of having the beam smash  into  stationary  targets, the LEP
       will have two beams moving in opposite directions.

       It will be the difference between a car running into  a tree and one
       car colliding head-on  with  another.   Second,  the  electrons will
       collide with their  antimatter  counterpart,   positrons,  producing
       total annihilation.

       Some collisions will  produce  Zs, the neutral agents  of  the  weak
       force.  A few  of these, theory predicts, will fall apart into Higgs
       bosons, which in turn will decay into a spray of other particles.

       The Zs and  Higgses  will  live  so   briefly  -  trillionths  of  a
       trillionth of a  second  -  that  they  will  be impossible  to  see
       directly.  But the end product, the spray of other particles, can be
       seen by complex detectors, and from it the researchers hope to infer
       the existence and properties of the Higgs (pp.  106-07).

       When the accelerator cranks up this summer, four experiments, all
       multimillion-dollar collaborations, will  begin  work.   L3  is  the
       biggest, the most expensive and  the  most  directly  aimed  at  the
       Higgs.

       The project began in 1979, when Ting, Becker and a  small  number of
       other physicists started designing an ambitious machine, a detector,
       that they hoped would trap the Higgs if, indeed, it exists.

       "We asked CERN  for  the  biggest hole they would give us," coleader
       Hans Hofer of Zurich says.  "It turned  out that we could fill it up
       completely with a detector the size of a four-story  building." This
       is the octagon  in the pit, a massive tube stuffed with electronics.
       Electrons and positrons  will  collide   at  its  center;  different
       detector parts will measure different particles flying  outward from
       the violence.

       "I hope," Becker says drily, "that Mr.  Higgs is pleased by how much
       trouble we have gone to in trying to find his little particle." His
       train of thought   is  interrupted  by  the  screech  of  a  million
       fingernails being dragged  across  a  million  blackboards  as  CERN
       workers drag a 20-foot-high metal rack across the concrete floor.

       "You know," Becker shouts over the noise "nobody sees Higgs!  He

                                      Page 6





       just sits up  there  in  Edinburgh!  My graduate students come to me
       all the time, asking me 'Who is  this  man  Higgs?'  Does  he really
       exist?"'

       On the wall  behind  Becker  is  a  painting  of an  object  vaguely
       resembling a Ferris  wheel,  It  is  the  section of the detector to
       which Becker has devoted nearly ten years of his life; the completed
       structure is more  than  30  feet  in  diameter,  yet  measures  the
       trajectories of particles called muons to within a  thousandth  of a
       millimeter.  Within the  wheel  is  a lacework of laser lights, each
       centered on a photosensitive cell.

       Like an onion, Becker explains, the detector consists of layers of
       instruments, each intended to measure a specific type of particle.

       Each layer takes  years  of work,  costs  millions  of  dollars  and
       requires delicate negotiations among the dozens of  institutions and
       nations involved.  Each  brings  unexpected benefits to industry: by
       giving one order to a company that  made  plastic whiskers for teddy
       bears, for example,  L3  launched  the  firm  into the  fiber-optics
       business.

       As Becker speaks, fatigue informs his voice; he has accumulated a
       quarter of a  million  miles in air travel.  There are shadows under
       his eyes and he often finds he needs  to  vent  his  frustrations by
       working on his car.

       "Nobody would choose to work this way, on projects  so big," he says
       "But we have  to,  if  we're going to chase after something like the
       Higgs.  And, obviously, we have to hope the people at Stanford don't
       get there ahead of us."

       Frustration and fury in a California lab

       A group of men and women gather, shirtsleeved  and disheveled, early
       one June morning at a laboratory just south of San Francisco.

       Outside, the California sky is as blue as heaven; inside,  the light
       is dim and  migraine  green.   In  a chair against the wall slumps a
       round-faced man with  bags  beneath   his   tired  eyes:  the  Nobel
       Prizewinning physicist and Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)
       director, Burton Richter, who has designed the project on which they
       are working.  He  has staked the rest of his career,  and  those  of
       everyone else in the room, on its completion.

       Richter, as it  happens,  shared his Nobel with Sam Ting in 1976 for
       their separate but simultaneous discovery  of  yet another subatomic
       particle, the J or Psi (SMITHSONIAN, July' 1975).

       Silent as stone,  Richter  watches  as,  one  after   another,   his
       colleagues recount the   small,  infuriating  problems  of  the  day
       before.  Blown electronics.    Inappropriate    settings.    Cooling
       difficulties.  Human error.  The list goes on and on.   The  project
       is more than  a  year  behind  schedule,  and  Richter's  fury is as
       palpable in the room as a heavy fog.

       "We're getting close,"  says  Andrew   Hutton,   the  tall,  bearded
       Englishman acting as program deputy.  "Close enough to proceed as if
       we were going to start for real."

                                      Page 7





       "Not as if," Richter says.  His voice is quiet, but his vehemence is
       unmistakable.  "We are starting.  It is real.  We can't wait anymore
       on this.  From now on, if something goes wrong, work around it.  You
       can't do science waiting for everything to work right.  I want us to
       start taking data at 4 Em."

       Hutton smiles.  "You  heard  the  man,"  he  says.  "In eight hours,
       we'll try to make history."

       Like their rivals at CERN, the scientists at Stanford are working on
       a particle accelerator.  Known as  the  SLAC  Linear Collider (SLC),
       the device is as intricate and baffling as an Escher drawing.

       Richter, its designer, had a hand in the original design  of the LEP
       When he discovered  that  the United States would not pay for such a
       gigantic machine, he tried to come  up  with  a  smaller device that
       would do the same work, and at a fraction of the cost  of a circular
       collider.  The linear collider is the result.

       Shaped somewhat like  a  two-mile-long  tennis  racket, it sends two
       pulses of particles - electrons  and  positrons  -  racing  down the
       handle and around opposite sides of the head until  they  meet  with
       soundless violence at the top.

       For most of  the  Journey, the particles move in a straight line and
       do not lose energy by giving off x  rays as they are forced to turn.
       That means the machine can be much smaller, and hence  more  quickly
       and inexpensively built,  than  a  conventional  accelerator.   Many
       physicists believe that the SLAC Linear  Collider is a prototype for
       future machines.

       On the other hand, the two bunches of particles must collide on the
       first pass, instead of having many chances as they spin millions of
       times around a ring.  The challenge is enormous: make two particle
       aggregations, each the thickness of a human hair, each  traveling at
       a fraction less  than  the  speed  of  light,  smash together at the
       precise center of a detector.

       Although construction began after  the  LEP,  the hope was to finish
       the Stanford accelerator more than a year sooner, giving  physicists
       there the first  chance  to  find  a  Higgs.   If all goes well, the
       machine's design will  have  been   one   of  the  most  daring  and
       successful gambles in recent science, and physicists  in  the United
       States will have   leapfrogged  their  friends  and  competitors  in
       Europe.  If, that is, all goes well.

       "There is a bare chance we can find the Higgs first," says Patricia
       Burchat, a young experimentalist at  Stanford.   "Like them, we will
       make Zs, some  of which will decay into Higgses.   The  question  is
       whether our machine  will  make  enough Zs, and that, I'm afraid, is
       not at all clear."

       "To get this project approved by the  government," Richter says, "we
       cut the budget to the point where there was some doubt  we  would be
       able to build  the machine.  It was a risk, but with the U.S. budget
       deficit, it was the only way we could get the money."

       The result is  a  bricolage,  new   equipment  attached  to  another
       accelerator that was built in the 1960s.  The jumble of old and new

       systems is an  engineer's  nightmare:  like an exotic sports car, it
       works fine on blocks in the garage, but develops new problems on the
       road.  The linear collider is now months behind, and every moment of
       additional delay further  cuts the  Americans'  chances  of  getting
       there first.

       At 4 that afternoon, Richter appears at the main control  center for
       the first test run.  Ninety minutes later, he is forced to leave in
       frustration: the machine  is  not  working.   With Richter gone, the
       staff continues to work before the  computer  screens lining one end
       of the long, dimly lighted room.

       The only sounds are the peeping of computer signals, the hush of air
       conditioning and the occasional murmur of a dismayed  voice.   At  a
       chair in the  center,  Hutton marks the log.  A Briton, he is one of
       the relatively few scientists to  work  both  in  California  and in
       Switzerland.

       "We've done enough to show that the principle works,"  he says. "You
       can make the   bunches   collide,   and   the   next  generation  of
       accelerators will be based on this  one.   But  the curious thing is
       that a future triumph will not be enough to make the  lab  look good
       today.  For that,  we  need to get this machine functioning ahead of
       our friends in Europe, and to get some physics done."

       Hutton laughs tiredly; he has been  working  for a long time without
       much sleep.  "I  must say that right now it would  be  really  nice-
       truly nice-if a Z turned up on the screen."

       They broke their hearts in San Francisco

       A punishing heat wave blankets San Francisco Bay at the end of July,
       forcing the region to ration water.  Faced with record 100-degree
       temperatures, the Stanford accelerator's components begin to
       malfunction.  Water pumps  break  down.   Flow  switches give up the
       ghost.  Microprocessors burn  out.   The  8  A.M.   meetings  become
       sweaty litanies of disaster.

       Five weeks after  Richter ordered the machine to be  turned  on  for
       real, the laboratory  has  managed  to accumulate a bare 21 hours of
       data, Not a single Z has been seen.  To make it worse, the Europeans
       are ahead of  schedule;  in an initial test, their  accelerator  has
       taken seven minutes  to  reach the goals scheduled to be achieved in
       seven days.

       Richter has taken to haunting the control room. His face looks, says
       one friend, as if he were barely restraining himself from biting his
       fingernails.  More and more, it is  apparent  that  the  jury-rigged
       machine was built too quickly and too cheaply.  Richter  is spending
       much time huddling  with  scientists  like  Martin  Breidenbach, the
       wiry, intense leader of the principal experiment.

       Weeks before, Breidenbach had been  happily  splayed  on  his  back,
       wrench in hand, beneath the team's detector; now he  is  being drawn
       to the accelerator  itself, for without the machine there will be no
       particles to detect, no discoveries to make.

       Back in his office at CERN, Sam Ting tells the delegation from the
       Soviet Union "I don't know what your rules are.  I don't even care.

                                      Page 9





       What I am  saying  is  this: when the announcement of a discovery is
       made, the people on the podium are  the ones who get the credit.  If
       you want your  scientists to get the credit they deserve,  you  will
       have to change your policies about not letting them work outside the
       Soviet Union.  Obviously,  the  choice  is  up  to  you, not me." He
       smiles.  "I am just a scientist, a lone professor at MIT".

       For the first time in the meeting, the Soviets laugh.  Whatever they
       think of their rules, experience has taught them that they are not
       dealing with lone  professors at  MIT.   The  face  of  physics  has
       changed and research is now performed by huge collaborations, run by
       men with fierce and powerful wills.  Richter, at Stanford,  is  one;
       Ting, at CERN, is another.

       A moment later  Ting says, "Nobody has spent all this time and money
       on these projects to do ordinary  physics.   I  will  consider  this
       experiment to be an utter failure if someone finds  the Higgs before
       we do or if we make a technical mistake that prevents us from making
       a major discovery."  Tapping  the symbol for the Higgs boson that he
       has written on the blackboard, Ting  repeats the words slowly.  "A .
       .  . major discovery."

       As the new year begins, tensions are running high at both CERN and
       Stanford.  The California team is still testing, but  hoped  to have
       the machine on-line as early as March.

       In Geneva, physicists  have  finished  installing  the components of
       their massive detector, are hoping  to  begin testing in late winter
       or early spring,  and  plan to have the machine up  and  running  by
       fall.

       In Scotland, serenity  reigns.   Sitting  in his small office at the
       University of Edinburgh, Peter Higgs  listens  to the details of the
       gargantuan effort to   find   the   particle  whose   existence   he
       hypothesized so many  years  ago.   "Of  course  I'm flattered by it
       all," he says.  Afternoon light comes  in the window, the same light
       that is filling  the  rolling  hills  outside  with  the  colors  of
       sunset"Of course I like it when they give seminars on the search for
       the Higgs and  so  on.  And of course I think it's important to look
       for.  But-you want to know the truth  -,  When  I  consider the huge
       sums going for this, the lifetimes spent on the search, I can't help
       but think: 'Good heavens, what have I done?"'
