                  The Riddle of Dellschau and His Esoteric Books
                            by J. Ward and P.G. Navarro

       "The year was 1910, the first gasoline-electric  combustion auto was
       in use.  Aviator W. R. Brookins flew to a height  of  one  mile.   A
       woman made a  public  flight  as  a pilot.  The first moving picture
       newsreel was exhibited and Father's Day was celebrated for the first
       time.

       "In Houston, a man began drawing  detailed  models  of air machines.
       Technically the machines probably would never the  ground,  nor  the
       drawing board for that matter.  But the mind of C.A.A. Dellschau was
       soaring.

       "In the next  fifteen  years,  Dellschau, with the help of a friend,
       would complete enough drawings to  fill  a  dozen scrap books.  Each
       drawing was carefully laid out, drawn on a grid, and  water-colored.
       A page of  newsclippings of the day might be included along with the
       sketches.  These pages he entitled  'Press  Blooms'  and  they often
       included stories from a German paper which was probably published in
       New York.

       "About a year ago eleven of these scrapbooks were  discovered  in  a
       dump yard.  Fred  Washington,  who describes himself as a scrounger,
       bought them from the man who found  them.  They sat in his furniture
       and antique shop gathering dust until some University  of St. Thomas
       students happened on  them.   Two  were selected to be part of their
       present display, 'The Sky is the Limit'".

       So began the article in the Houston  Chronicle  written by Ms. Sarah
       Peterson that fine June day of 1969.  One must forgive her for the

                                      Page 1





       many small errors in the story.  She reported what she had been told
       and no one  really  knew  much  about Dellschau or his books.  After
       nearly 14 years, a great deal has  been learned about them, but they
       still remain as enigmatic as ever.

       The books are about 22" X 22" and varying thicknesses.  The "plates"
       or pages are  bound  between  covers of heavy cardboard,  reinforced
       with more cardboard  along  the  edges, and sewn together with heavy
       thread.  The binding is held together  with  shoelace material.  One
       of the books has a heavy string with a metal washer  tied to the end
       and may have intended as a book marker.

       The covers, inside  and out, were lined with purple or green-colored
       cheese-cloth (which was  later  removed   as   it  had  deteriorated
       completely).  The material in the covers came from  cardboard  boxes
       and corrugated cardboard.  In some books, the laces were inserted on
       the covers, near  the binding, for use as a handle.  Shoe laces were
       also used for keeping the books  closed  by  tying  them  at several
       places along the   edges   of   the  covers.   Though   crude,   the
       construction is very reminiscent of Elizabethan portfolios.

       Because of their  fragile  condition,  they  were  displayed  at the
       university under glass and each day  a  new  set of pages were shown
       for the amazement of the visitors.  And amazed they  were,  for they
       saw bizarre aircraft  exhibiting  minute  details  of  construction,
       including, in some drawings, flaps and sections that could be opened
       up to show both exterior and interior  views, respectively.  Yet the
       viewers were unaware of the most amazing aspects of these books.

       Each page was numbered and dated.  And upon examination  of  the  12
       discovered books, it  was  found  that the earliest date was January
       24, 1908 and the lowest page or plate  number was 1,601.  The latest
       date was July 24, 1921, on page number 5,230.  There  was  a  gap in
       the sequence from January 24, 1908 to July 24, 1921 with 1,600 pages
       missing.  This meant that 3,200 pages were still undiscovered, which
       amounts to about  18  to  20 more books!  Assuming the dates on each
       drawing meant the date he started working on it, Dellschau must have
       worked and produced his drawings  at  the  rate  of approximately 23
       drawings per month or 276 per year.  More amazing still  is that the
       books extant contained  multiple  drawings  of  over  100  DIFFERENT
       craft.  This means the missing books  may  have contained an equally
       large number of other aircraft designs.

       Designing 100 craft  of  any  nature  is  a  monumental   task;  yet
       Dellschau designed and  drew over 200 of these craft within a period
       of just 20  years,  which  is  a relatively  short  period  of  time
       considering all the  details  of  design  and  patterning  that  was
       involved in producgin  each  of  his  drawings.   Not  only were the
       general shapes and layout of the  interior  different  in each case,
       but these designs   show   dozens   of  different   techniques   for
       transferring the "supe", or liquid propellant to the converter which
       changed it into  a  hot  gas.   There  were also dozens of different
       styles and constructions  of  converters.    There   were  different
       methods of inflating and deflating the gas bags.   And  even  before
       the gas reached  the  gas storage bags, it was used in later designs
       to operate various and sundry pieces  of  equipment  including "air-
       press motors", navigational devices, powered wheels for land travel,
       inflatable pontoons and/or  side  paddle-wheels  for  water  travel.
       Some craft even displayed gas nozzles for propelling the craft

       along.  And this  was  long  before  jet  propulsion, as used by our
       modern aircraft, was even envisioned.

       It seems impossible that one man  could  have  possibly  done all of
       this, yet the most amazing part is still to be covered!

       Each of these drawings and "press-blooms" are framed  with an ornate
       and colorful border  and no two are alike.  Within these borders are
       names, dates, and other data, some printed, some in illuminated type
       script, and some in code and other  forms of symbols.  Predominantly
       displayed on almost every page, are the code symbols for the acronym
       NYMZA - nowhere is this acronym in "clear"; ALWAYS in code.

       Scattered throughout the drawings is the letter X surrounded  by one
       or two circles, sometimes alone and sometimes with other letters and
       numerals also circled.   While the X is a code symbol for the letter
       Z, it is believed that the circled  X  means  AERO.  This conclusion
       was reached because of such notations as "KEEP THE  X", "WORTH X HOW
       MUCH X", and  others  that  indicate  a word or object rather than a
       letter.  In several places the circled X is given special prominence
       by its insertion within the ciphers which designate the Society name
       or initials.  But most often it is found in conjunction with circled
       V's.

       This last combination is especially  intriguing since the skull is a
       symbol for death and there are notations that several members of the
       Sonora Aero Club  had met their deaths in some way  related  to  the
       aeros.  The skull  can  be  found  in  several places throughout his
       books and seems to indicate danger  or  death  in connection with an
       Aero or someone  involved  with  its desing.  In one  instance,  the
       skull and cross-bones  was associated with the symbols for NYMZA and
       there was a vertical line of ciphers which contained the word "todt"
       which is the German word for death.   Very  little is clearly stated
       and must be interpreted.

       One would expect  that  his  enciphered  messages would  be  clearly
       stated, but such  is  not  the case.  Even after his code was broken
       and the messages  decoded, trouble  was  encountered.   His  English
       words were misspelled and his grammar was very bad.   His German was
       even worse.  It  was  "archaic" German, stilted and containing words
       no one had seen before and whose  meaning  was  unclear.   Even  his
       written messages were done in old-style German script  and difficult
       to read.  It  was as though neither English or German was his native
       tongue.

       The following are examples of attempted translations:

          In the  old times...the warrior  used  a  circle,  a  man  lance,
          and...in the country the bow and arrow.  When war  say deathknell
          was upon land and water!  And today are censored.

          You Christian  beings  haters.   Cannon and small guns in war, on
          land and wave!  Give me quick  an  airplane  sublime..the enemy's
          might destroy.

          You Christian  love - hard to understand on violent  Earth.   The
          enemy "thrashed".

          It if happens from under or above, the bad middle let us praise!

                                      Page 3





          So it was as long as there were people!  You Christian love reach
          for the  wanderplace,  and wander away from Earth.  Planets there
          are enough where Christian love shall be as they say so nicely in
          Book SELAG.

          The trip costs a lot of money, and often also borrowed money.  We
          go when it please us and when  it  is  safe.   Whoever goes...and
          that is our way...For over and through the blue  there is no way.
          There is  no  way, FOR YOU are alone.  Being alone you sit at the
          rudder.  Say you long for the world,  dear  Luder.  Show the line
          before you.  You pull it hard and so it shall be.   Then  down it
          will come to Mother Earth.

          Let the  big  men  beat  themselves  with  clubs or air balloons.
          There we have nothing to say.   Then  each  makes the living from
          it.  I  must have my say so.  The little people  will  stay  with
          us..and the  good says the teaching.  Money quiets the fight, and
          first with war balloons.

          Ah, the very fine cannon has spared  us dear people.  What fright
          I have received.  Luder, we are safe now that we have been spared
          by the bullets.  Yes, the clouds weakened their path.

          Sir, the sailor here Gekisher (was hysterical).  He was loud, but
          not as the crow of a rooster.  Now, after a few  years, this will
          become a  legend.  The noble men will know what an Aero they have
          flown.  Not us.  The fog-horn (?) has saved many a word.

          Again....on....up to heaven's path!

       These passages may be interpreted as either the ravings of a mad-man
       or the words  of an alien being from  a  crippled  space-craft  that
       crashed here on Earth, depending on your response to  the  following
       questions.  Dellschau spoke  "good  German",  why  did he write such
       "bad German"?  Why did he use an archaic form?  Why the old and very
       difficult to read German script for  passages  like these and modern
       script normally?  And  why were some of the above  also  encoded  in
       cipher to make   them  unreadable?   He  often  annotated  that  his
       knowledge of open secrets were not  for  profane  eyes.   What "open
       secrets" can the above reveal?

       C.A.A. Dellschau was not alone in his obsession of  drawing  strange
       aircraft and writing in code.  Several papers in 1897 mentioned that
       the Mystery Airships had flown over Omaha and hovered over a house a
       few miles from  the city.  The house was the home of John O. Preast,
       a German immigrant and "loner".  After his death, his home was found
       filled with drawings of strange airships, models, and piles of coded
       writings.  Coincidence, or connection?
