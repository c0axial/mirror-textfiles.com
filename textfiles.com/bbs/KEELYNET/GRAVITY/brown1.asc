       The following text  is  removed  directly  from the BROWN patent for
       electrostatic propulsion/levitation.
       -------------------------------------------------------------------

       My invention relates   to   electrokinetic   apparatus,   and   more
       particularly to method   and  apparatus  for  utilizing   electrical
       potentials for the  production  of forces for the purpose of causing
       relative motion between a structure and the surrounding medium.

       This invention was disclosed and described  in my application Serial
       No. 293,465, filed  June  13,  1952,  which application  has  become
       abandoned. However, reference  may  be  made to this application for
       the purpose of completing the disclosure set forth below.

       The invention utilizes   ad   heretofore    unknown   electrokinetic
       phenomenon which I have discovered;  namely, that  when  a  pair  of
       electrodes of appropriate  form  are  held in a certain fixed spaced
       relation to each other and immersed  in a dielectric medium and then
       oppositely charged to  an  appropriate degree, a force  is  produced
       tending to move the pair of electrodes through the medium.

       The invention is  concerned  primarily  with  certain  apparatus for
       utilizing such phenomenon in various manners to be described.

       Priorly, intervening electrokinetic  apparatus  has been employed to
       convert electrical energy to mechanical energy and  then  to convert
       the mechanical energy   to  the  required  force.   Except  for  the
       insignificantly small forces   of   electrostatic   attraction   and
       repulsion, electrical energy  has  not  been  used  for  the  direct
       production of force and motion.

       Since and conversion   of   energy  from  one  form  to  another  is
       accompanied by losses due to friction,  radiation  or  conduction of
       heat, hysteresis, and the like, as well as serious reductions in the
       availability of the  energy  by  increases  in the  entropy  of  the
       system, it is  apparent  that  great  increases in efficiency may be
       achieved through the  use of the  direct  production  of  electrical
       energy and force and motion made possible by my invention.

       Likewise, the elimination  of  the  machinery  for the  intermediate
       conversions results in great savings in first costs, maintenance,

                                      Page 1





       weight and space,  the latter two being of great importance in self-
       propelled vehicles including mobile  vehicles  such  as aircraft and
       space craft.

       It is therefore  an object of my invention to provide  an  apparatus
       for converting the energy of an electrical potential directly into a
       mechanical force suitable  for  causing  relative  motion  between a
       structure and the surrounding medium.

       It is another object of this invention  to provide a novel apparatus
       for converting and electrical potential directly to  usable  kinetic
       energy.

       It is another  object of this invention to provide a novel apparatus
       for converting electrostatic energy directly into kinetic energy.

       It is another  object  of  this  invention   to  provide  a  vehicle
       motivated by electrostatic energy without the use of moving parts.

       It is still  another  object of this invention to  provide  a  self-
       propelled vehicle without moving parts.

       It is a  feature  of  my  invention  to  provide  an  apparatus  for
       producing relative motion between  a  structure  and the surrounding
       medium which apparatus includes a pair of electrodes  of appropriate
       form held in  fixed  spaced relation to each other and immersed in a
       dielectric medium and oppositely charged.

       It is another feature of my invention  to  provide  apparatus  which
       includes a body  defining one electrode, another separate  electrode
       supported in fixed  spaced  relation  by  said body, and a source of
       high electrical potential  connected   between   the  body  and  the
       separate electrode.

       It is also a feature of my invention to provide apparatus  having  a
       body which is  hollow and a source of potential contained within the
       body.

       It is another feature of my invention  to provide apparatus having a
       body and an  electrode  connected  to  the  body, which  combination
       comprises a vehicle.

       It is also  a  feature  of  my  invention to provide apparatus which
       comprises a plurality of assemblies,  each  including  a body and an
       electrode secured in side-by-side spaced relation to each other.

       It is another feature of my invention to provide vehicular apparatus
       which includes a pair electrically conductive body  portions  joined
       by an insulating   portion,  whereby  said  electrically  conductive
       portions constitute the electrodes.

       Other objects and advantages of my invention will be apparent from a
       consideration of the  following specification,  read  in  connection
       with the accompanying drawings, wherein:

                the arrangement  of  parts  used  in an alternative form of

       Referring to the drawings, I have  illustrated  in Figure 1 a simple
       form of apparatus   which   is   readily  adaptable   for   use   in
       demonstrating the principles  of my invention, and which is utilized
       in this application as a simplified  representation to facilitate an
       understanding of the principles involved.

       The apparatus illustrated in Figure 1 constitutes on electrode which
       is preferably in  the  form  of  a  body  member  20,   said  member
       preferable comprising a relatively thing flat plate.

       A second electrode  21, in the form of a wire or other suitable form
       of electrical conductor is held as be means of insulated supports 22
       in fixed spaced relation to the body  20, the wire 21 being disposed
       in the plane of the body 20 and preferably substantially parallel
       with a leading edge 23 of the body 20.  A source 24  of high voltage
       electrical potential is provided and connected as shown at 25 and 26
       to the two electrodes 20 and 21, respectively.

       I have discovered   that   when  apparatus  of  the  character  just
       described is immersed in a dielectric  medium,  as  for example, the
       ordinary air of the atmosphere, there is produced a force tending to
       move the entire  assembly  through  the medium, and  this  force  is
       applied in such direction as to tend to move the body 20 towards the
       leading electrode 21.   This  force produces relative motion between
       the apparatus and the surrounding fluid dielectric.

       Thus, if the apparatus is held in  a  fixed position, the dielectric
       medium is caused to move past the apparatus and to  this  extent the
       apparatus may be considered as analogous to a pump or fan.

       Conversely, if the  apparatus  is  free to move, the relative motion
       between the medium and the apparatus  results in a forward motion of
       the apparatus, and it is thus seen that the apparatus is a self-

                                      Page 3





       propulsive device.

       While the phenomenon  just  described  has  been  observed  and  its
       existence confirmed by repeated experiment,  the principles involved
       are not completely  understood.   It  has been determined  that  the
       greatest forces are  developed  when  the  leading electrode is made
       positive with respect to the body  20, and it is accordingly thought
       that in the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  electrode  21  where  the
       potential gradient is very high, free electrons are stripped off of
       the atoms and molecules of the surrounding medium.

       These electrons migrate  to the positive electrode 21 where they are
       collected.  This removal of free  electrons  leaves  the  respective
       atoms and molecules  positively charged and such charged  atoms  and
       molecules are accordingly  repelled  from  the positive electrode 21
       and attracted toward the negative electrode 20.

       The paths of movement of these positively  charged  particles appear
       to be of the nature represented by the lines 27 in Figure 2.

       It appears that upon reaching or closely approaching  the surface of
       the body 20,  the  positively charged atoms and molecules have their
       positive charges neutralized by the  capture  of  electrons from the
       body 20 and  in  many  cases,  it may be that excess  electrons  are
       captured whereby to  five such atoms and molecules a negative charge
       so that they are actually repelled from the body 20.

       It will be appreciated that the  mass  of  each  of  the  individual
       electrons is approximately  one  two-thousandths  the  mass  of  the
       hydrogen atom and  is  accordingly  negligible  as compared with the
       mass of the atoms and molecules of  the  medium  from  this they are
       taken.

       The principle forces involved therefore are the forces  involved  in
       moving the charged  atoms  and  molecules  from  the  region  of the
       positive electrode 21 to and beyond the negatively charged body
       20.  The force so exerted by the system on these atoms and molecules
       not only produces a flow  of the medium  relative  to the apparatus,
       but, of course,  results  in a like force on the system  tending  to
       move the entire  system  in the opposite direction;  that is, to the
       left as viewed in Figure 1 of the drawing.

       The above suggested explanation  of  the  mode  of  operation of the
       device is supported by observation of the fact that  the  dimensions
       and potentials utilized  must  be  adjusted  to produce the required
       electric field and the resulting propulsive force.

       Actually I have found that the potential gradient must be below that
       value required to  produce  a  visible   corona   since   corona  is
       objectionable inasmuch as it represents losses through the radiation
       of heat, light and molecular charges in the medium.

       My experiments have indicated that the electrode 21  may be of small
       diameter for the  lower  voltage  ranges,  i.e.  below 125 kv, while
       above this voltage, rod or hollow pipe electrodes are preferred.

       These large electrodes are preferred  for  the higher voltages since
       sharp points or  edges  are  eliminated  which  at   these  elevated
       potentials would produce losses thus diminishing the thrust.

                                      Page 4





       For example, electrodes  to  be operated at potentials below 125 kv.
       may be made from small gauge wire  only  large enough to provide the
       required mechanical rigidity  while  electrodes to  be  operated  at
       potentials above 125  kv.   may  be  hollow  pipes  or rods having a
       diameter of 1/4 to 1/2 inch.

       In Figure 3, I have illustrated the  manner  in which a plurality of
       assemblies, such as are shown in Figure 1, may be interconnected for
       joint operation.  As may be seen from Figure 3, a plurality  of such
       assemblies are placed in spaced side-by-side relation.

       They may be  held fixed in such spaced relation through the use of a
       plurality of tie rods 28 and interposed  spacers  (not shown) placed
       between adjacent plates 20.

       The assembly of  plates 20 may be electrically interconnected  by  a
       bus bar or  similar  conductor  29  to which the negative lead 25 is
       connected.

       In a similar way, the plurality of  positive  leading  electrodes 21
       may be held  in  appropriately  spaces  relation to  each  other  by
       fastening their ends  to  pairs of bus bars 30 and 31, to the latter
       of which the positive lead 26 is connected.  The assembly of leading
       electrodes 21 may be held in spaced relation to the assembly of body
       members 20 by an appropriate arrangement of the supports 22.

       In Figure 4, I have illustrated diagrammatically  an  arrangement of
       parts for producing  a reversible action;  that is,  permitting  the
       direction of the propulsive force to be reversed.

       The apparatus is  similar  to  that  shown  in  Figure  1, differing
       therefrom in utilizing a pair of  leading  electrodes  21f  and  21r
       spaced by means of spacers 22 from the front and rear edges 23f and
       23r of the body member 20 in a manner similar to that described with
       reference to the  supports 22 in Figure 1.  The source  24  of  high
       voltage electrical potential  has its negative terminal connected to
       the body 20 as by means of the aforementioned conductor 25.

       The positive terminal is connected  as  by means of the conductor 26
       to the blade  27 of a single-pole, double-throw switch,  serving  in
       one position to connect the conductor 26 to a conductor 26f which is
       in turn connected  to  forward  electrode  21f  and  arranged in its
       opposite position to connect the  conductor  26  to  a conductor 26r
       which is in turn connected to the reverse electrode 21r.

       It will be  seen  that with the switch 27 in the position  shown  in
       Figure 4, the  apparatus  will  operate  in  the manner described in
       connection with Figure 1, causing  the  assembly to move to the left
       as viewed in Figure 4.

       By throwing the switch 27 to the opposite position, the direction of
       the forces produced are reversed and the device moves  to  the right
       as viewed in Figure 4.

       In Figure 5,  I  have illustrated the principles of the invention as
       embodied in a simple form of mobile vehicle.  This device includes a
       body member 50 which is preferably  of  the  form of a circular disc
       somewhat thicker in its center that at its edges.


                                      Page 5





       The disc 50  constitutes  one of the electrodes and is equivalent of
       the body member  20 referred to in  connection  with  Figure  1.   A
       leading electrode 51 in the form of a wire or similar small diameter
       conductor is supported form the body 50 by a plurality of insulating
       supports 52 in uniform  spaced parallel relation to  a  leading edge
       portion 53 of the body 50.

       A skirt or  similar faring 54 may be carried by the body 50 to round
       out the entire  structure  so  as  to  provide  a  device  which  is
       substantially circular in plan.

       A source of high voltage electrical potential 55  is  provided  with
       its negative terminal  connected  as  indicated at 56 to the body 50
       and its positive  terminal connected  as  indicated  at  57  to  the
       leading electrode 51.

       The device operates  in  the same manner as the apparatus  shown  in
       Figure 1 to  produce  a  force  tending  to move the entire assembly
       through the surrounding medium to  the left as viewed in Figure 5 of
       the drawing.
