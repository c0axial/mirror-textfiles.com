       Although I have  stated  previously that I am unable or unwilling to
       discuss material of "sensitive"  nature,  I  am  willing  to discuss
       material that is  of "public knowledge" that may  (or  may  not)  be
       being studied and  developed  by  one  of  many groups within the US
       government, and/or may (or not) be  technology  associated with UFOs
       and/or secret government projects.

       I am unable to give any details that might compromise  the  security
       of the government  (or  myself), as in, how I became knowledgable of
       this information, how it might pertain to governmental projects, how
       it might relate to UFO technology being studied, or the advancements
       and research that might still be classified by the government.

       All the information that I shall present  is  of "public knowledge",
       and I have included some sources that may be helpful  for  those who
       might be interested in further research.

       I will attempt  to  briefly  touch  on these subjects and attempt to
       lead you in a direction that with additional research and a logical
       approach, you might be able to come to your own conclusions.

       ELECTRO-AERODYNAMICS: Electric charges  are  applied  to  high-speed
               vehicles for the purpose of reducing air drag or eliminating
               sonic booms.  High-speed ions are projected forward from the
               leading edges  of  the  craft,  the  corona glow  propagates
               forward and  repels  air  molecules  away  from the oncoming
               surfaces, thus a shock wave cannot be mechanically produced.

       COUNTER-GRAVITATION: The sustaining  of  an object in space by means
               of a  counter-gravitational   effect  produced  through  the
               action of an electric field upon the object. Associated with
               the effects of levitation in this manner, is  a simultaneous
               appearance of  a strange luminous halo that appears at about
               500,000 volts.

       Although I didn't give much information on these subjects, I hope it
       will be helpful in your investigations  and  research  into  the UFO
       phenomenon. I will _attempt_ to answer any questions here, but don't
       know how much  or  little  I should say. I'll also  try  to  collect
       additional information on various subjects that might (or not) be
       related to, or  on the border of being "sensitive" material, but can
       be documented as being "public knowledge".

                                           Thanks for your time, Phillipp
