       Today, 22 June 1991, I visited the village of Mortimer, Berkshire,
       England where John Searl lived 10 years ago at the address 17
       Stephen's Close.

       Searl described to me that he built many flying disks while living
       there, and made demonstrations to the local people.  He also said
       that he was arrested in 1982 to stop his experiments, and his house
       was burnt down the next day to destroy his equipment. I visited the
       village to check the veracity of the information.

       I saw the house, the fairground, the high-tension pylons, and I
       talked to three people who all remembered him. One of his neighbours
       said he didn't think there had been a fire in the house.

       He did remember that Searl was arrested for trying to topple one of
       the high tension pylons visible from the house, and that (as far as
       he knew) he ended up in prison for it.

       He did remember that Searl sometimes put up posters that he would
       demonstrate his flying disks at the fairground.  He would charge
       people a lot of money for seeing a flying disk, but nobody ever saw
       a disk levitate.  Searl always claimed that the failure was due to
       the weather or some such circumstance.

       Many people wondered whether Searl was onto something, or whether he
       was making a fool of himself.  Nobody found any proof that he was
       onto something.  The neighbor didn't remember any problems between
       Searl and the electricity company before Searl tried to topple the
       pylon.

       Another inhabitant of the village remembered visiting the room in
       Searl's house that was filled with electrical equipment, and
       remembered that many people in the village wondered whether he was
       onto something, but none saw any proof that he was.  This inhabitant
       also didn't remember any trouble between Searl and the electricity
       company before Searl tried to topple the pylon.

       A third inhabitant also remembered Searl, but didn't know of anyone
       who had seen any proof that he could make disks levitate or could do
       any other abnormal feat.

       Searl's family no longer lived in the village.  It can be said with

                                      Page 1





       some certainty that Searl never made any public demonstrations of a
       flying disk, and that he probably never succeeded in levitating a
       disk, and that he was lying when he said his house was burnt down.

       Vangard note...

            We should all be most appreciative of the time, energy and
            expense of Mr. Heerfordt in looking into the claims of John
            Searle.

            It is very odd that of all the experiments Searle claims to
            have carried out, there are no witnesses.  Surely someone must
            be willing to come forth to recount what they had seen.  One
            would think the villagers would have seen something supportive
            of Searle's claim.

            Mr. Heerfordt had personally interviewed Searle to gather
            information and establish claims with dates and traceable
            information.  As the above file seems to indicate, there is not
            much if anything, which lends credence to Searle's claim of
            building either a levitating disc OR a free energy device based
            on the levitation technology operating in a governed fashion.
