                         John Searl and his flying disks.
                     a personal commentary by Anders Heerfordt

       I heard a  speech by John Searl around 5 Dec 1990. During the speech
       he claimed that  he  could  produce   antigravity  and  free  energy
       effects, using special magnets, and that he had been building flying
       saucers. He also  said  that he had a special magnet  bar  and  some
       magnetic cylinders with   such  unusual  properties.  He  could  not
       demonstrate the bar, he said, because  British customs had prevented
       him from bringing the magnets.

       According to Searl, many people had seen his flying  disks.  I tried
       to find somebody  who  had  seen  Searl  demonstrate something. That
       turned out to be difficult.

       During the speech Searl said that Gunnar Sandberg (a scientist at
       Sussex University) had seen him demonstrate  perpetual  motion  with
       his magnet bar and his magnetic rollers. Sandberg was not present at
       the speech.

       I visited Sandberg  at  Sussex University and asked  him  about  the
       demonstration.  Gunnar had  seen  the  magnetic bar and the magnetic
       rollers, and Searl had told him a  lot about them, but Searl had not
       demonstrated any unusual effects to him.

       In this case Searl was apparently not being truthful.

       I asked Searl if he could demonstrate the unusual effects to me, but
       he said that unfortunately he couldn't, because some  of the magnets
       had been lost, and he no longer had a complete set.

       I asked Searl to help me find someone who had known him in the past,
       so that I  could  ask  them  to  confirm  his  claims.  He  tried to
       discourage me from searching for  his  past  associates, saying that
       they had all died, or disappeared.

       That he and others had spent thousands of pounds on  advertising  in
       newspapers to find old witnesses, but none had surfaced. I mentioned
       Sandberg, but Searl  did  not think I should talk to Sandberg. As he
       had claimed Sandberg was a witness,  it seems strange that he should
       first say that  no witnesses could be found, then  acknowledge  that
       Sandberg was available,  then  try  to discourage me from talking to
       Sandberg.

       I mentioned to  Searl that he had been married, and one would assume
       that his family had known about his  experiments,  and  that I would
       like to hear their story.

       Searl said that  his  wife  had  been a very evil  person,  who  had
       ridiculed his experiments,  and  who had prevented his children from
       seeing any of his experiments. Searl  did not want me to talk to his
       family.

       Sandberg, however, had  managed to find a son, who  had  seen  disks
       being suspended from  wires, so that they could be photographed, but
       who hadnt seen any demonstration of antigravity or free energy.

       I managed to find a Mr. Louis Avilio,  who had worked with Searl for
       5 years, and  I  asked him whether he could confirm  the  claims  of
       Searl. He could not.

       Searl has certainly  told  him  a  lot about such claims, but he had
       never seen Searl  demonstrate his  claims  of  perpetual  motion  or
       antigravity. He had  however  not  known  Searl in  the  fifties  or
       sixties, where some experiments should have been done.

       Louis Avillio had met somebody, who had worked with Searl during the
       fifties or sixties,  but  he  hadn't  seen  any  proof of the claims
       either.

       Searl should have had a childhood  friend.  His  father was a George
       Haynes.  Searl and the friend made experiments together.  They  made
       the first free  energy magnet together, and the friend's father paid
       for the materials.

       The father is dead by now, but the  son  should  still be alive, and
       should be able  to  tell  about Searl's first experiments.  I  asked
       Searl for the  name  of  the  friend,  but  Searl  said  he couldn't
       remember it.

       I asked him where his friend lived  at  the  time,  but  again Searl
       evaded and said that he could not remember it. I had  the impression
       that Searl did not want me to find his childhood friend.

       Searl said his  magnet  bar  with the unusual properties was made of
       neodynium, titanium and bakelite.  A  small  chip  of  the  bar  was
       analyzed by a  scientist  at  Sussex  University. The  results  were
       published in Raum  &  Zeit.   According  to the analysis the bar was
       made of a magnetic mixture of iron and titanium.

       There were some  rare  earth  metals   in   the  mixture,  including
       neodynium.  Iron-titanium magnetic    powders   were    commercially
       available in fifties  or  sixties.  A  small  amount of a rare earth
       mixture was included as an antioxidant .

       Searl's magnet is apparaently made from such a powder.  It does
       not appear that Searl has been truthful  about  how his magnetic bar
       was made.

       I asked Searl  about news paper articles, but he  did  not  think  I
       should look for  newspaper  articles. He said however that there had
       been a lot of articles about his  work  back  in  1981,  when he was
       building a large flying saucer that could carry passengers.

       He was then  living  in  Mortimer,  near Reading west of London. The
       work had stopped when he became very ill, and went to hospital.

       Somebody then destroyed all his materials  and  models, and all that
       survived was his magnet bar and the magnetic rollers.   When pressed
       he admitted that  he  had  not  gone to hospital, but he had gone to
       jail after a court case in June-July 1981 at a court in Reading.

       He said he had been sentenced for  not  paying his electricity bill.
       He said he had only used electricity from his free energy generator,
       not from the public network.

       I asked the  court in Reading whether they could confirm  this,  but
       they said that the court records were not public.

       I went through  the  issues of the London newspaper Times from June-
       July 1981 but there was no mention  of  Mrs  Searl  and  his  flying
       saucers.

       I called the newspaper in Reading, but they said I  would have to go
       to Reading myself and go through their archives, if I wanted to find
       anything from that period. I haven't been to Reading yet.

       So I haven't  used up all possibilities of research into the past of
       John Searl. If I went to Reading  and  went  through the newspaper I
       might find that  Searl  was sentenced for something  else  than  not
       paying his electricity bill.

       Perhaps he was  sentenced  for  fraudulently  selling tickets to the
       Moon?

       The research I have done, does not  support that Searl ever made any
       flying disks or free energy machines, but rather it supports that he
       has a good phantasy.

       The people who  have  met him say that he seems convinced  that  his
       claims are possible, which is strange, because he has no evidence to
       support them.

       Perhaps antigravity and  free  energy  can  be demonstarted in a way
       similar to the one Searl describes.  But  as  he doesnt seem to have
       demonstrated it himself,  it  seems  strange that he  should  be  so
       convinced that it can be done.
