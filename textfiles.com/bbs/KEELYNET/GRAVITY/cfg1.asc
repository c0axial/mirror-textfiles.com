                         Charge Fluctuations as a Possible
                          Origin of Biefeld-Brown Effects
                                by Darrell Moffitt

       The Biefeld-Brown effect,   if   it   is  not  ionic,  presents  the
       phenomenon of a highly charged electrical  condenser  moving  in the
       direction of its  positive  pole when suspended in  a  gravitational
       field.

       A possible explanation for this behavior might be found by
       invoking statistical mechanics.    A  fundamental  theorem  of  this
       discipline states that the maximum  fluctuations  of  a given system
       are directly proportional to the square root of the particle number.

       Given this result, it is illuminating to consider the role played by
       charge fluctuations in a Biefeld-Brown device.  A simple calculation
       reveals a curious fact.

       One gram of matter contains

                         6.0223*10^23 (Avogadro's number)

       proton-electron combinations.  Thus, a maximum fluctuation  in  this
       system corresponds to a particle number of approximately

                       7.7604*10^11 "neutral" charge pairs.

       (The pairing is  not completely neutral, as virtual fluctuations and
       polarization effects are always present.)

       If one takes a value of

         2.3071*10^-19 (gm*cm^3/t^2) for the proton-electron interaction,

       and multiplies it by the fluctuation  particle number, the resulting
       quantity,

                            1.7037*10^-7(gm*cm^3/t^2),

       represents the (maximal) fluctuation charge product  in  a  gram  of
       matter.  (All units are in the cgs system.)

                                      Page 1





       Recent measurements of  Newton's  constant yield a figure of roughly
       6.6732*10^-8(cm^3/gm*t^2).

       Therefore, the magnitude of gravitational  interaction  between  two
       grams of matter is just slightly less than that produced  by  charge
       fluctuations within the sample.  Let's look at this more closely.

       Statistical systems are  usually  described in terms of distribution
       functions. One of these, the Gaussian distribution,

                              (exp(-x ^2)/2pi)^(1/2),

       often appears in studies of statistical  systems,  and  is  used  to
       generate the first-order wave functions of quantum mechanics.

       Simple fluctuation waves  then,  are specified by equations  of  the
       form

                             (N*exp(-x^2)/2pi)^(1/2).

       This function, however,  describes  a  total  distribution,  not the
       steady-state, equilibrium behavior of the system.

       That is better described by limit-point  equations,  i.e., iterative
       equations whose output  is  fed  back  until it reaches  a  singular
       value.

       Iterative equations possess  many  remarkable  properties, one being
       that of self-similar  (fractal  solution)   structure.    They  also
       demonstrate limit-point, oscillatory,    or    chaotic    behaviors,
       depending upon the nature of the function and its parameters.

       The function of  interest  here  is  the Gaussian distribution.  Its
       equilibrium value is given by the equation

                   (exp(-x^2)/(2pi))^(1/2))-x=0, where x=.3722.

       Multiplying "x" by the figure given  above  for  total  fluctuations
       (per gram) yields a value of roughly

                         6.6639*10^-8(gm*cm^3/t^2)(1/gm)^2

       which agrees with Newton's constant to within 99.86%.

       This coincidence, if  that  is  what  it  is,  suggests  a  probable
       relation between Biefeld-Brown effects and gravitation, but fails to
       relate more than a quantitative agreement of amplitudes.

       Extending the analysis  requires  treatment of such topics as charge
       screening, non-equilibrium thermodynamics,   and   plasma   physics,
       notably the physics of wave propagation in cold plasmas.

       Extensive studies by  this  author  and  others indicate  that  true
       gravitation is an    electromagnetic   phenomenon   described   most
       accurately by equations related to the Casimir potentials of quantum
       mechanics, and predicated upon the  existence  of  a  vacuum  ground
       state (zero point energy).

       This approach has to date yielded numerous relations whose

                                      Page 2





       predictions agree with  measured  gravitation  to an accuracy on par
       with that of quantum electrodynamics,  based  upon  a  treatment  of
       scalar mass potentials in the context of stochastic  electrodynamics
       (unpublished).

       Therefore, it is  the  author's  belief  that  Biefeld-Brown effects
       originate in mass-bound charge fluctuations  of bulk matter, whereas
       vacuum, or "true" gravitation must be described theoretically  at  a
       single-particle level, a  process  qualitatively  distinct from that
       suggested by the previous study.

       If this is true,it should be possible  to  derive  a theory based on
       interactions of mass-bound charge fluctuations with  virtual  states
       of the quantum vacuum.

       A useful starting  point  for  such  studies is Fradkin and Shabad's
       1974 paper "Spontaneous  Breaking  of  Translational  Invariance  in
       Quantum Electrodynamics".

       There, Fradkin and Shabad propose a theory of vacuum structure which
       is noteworthy for its description of "spontaneous"  charged particle
       currents propagating at lightspeed, i.e., in massless form.

       Fradkin and Shabad     also    derive    spacelike    (superluminal,
       longitudinal) wave vectors which  couple  to  produce the tranverse,
       luminal photons normally observed.

       In conclusion, the physics of mass-bound charge fluctuations  is (to
       this author's knowledge)  an  unexplored  but highly useful field of
       inquiry. In time  it  may  yield  a  deeper  comprehension  of  both
       Biefeld-Brown effects and the virtual phenomenon of quantum
       vacuum physics.
