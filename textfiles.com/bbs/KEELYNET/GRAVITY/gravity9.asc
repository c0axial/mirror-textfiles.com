               BRITISH SCIENTISTS TO SEARCH FOR "ANTI-GRAVITY" FORCE

       LONDON (OCT. 28) XINHUA - A TEAM OF BRITISH SCIENTISTS IS SETTING UP
                                 AN EXPERIMENT  TO  SEARCH  FOR  AN  "ANTI-
                                 GRAVITY" FORCE, "THE TIMES" NEWSPAPER
                                 REPORTED TODAY.

       MOST OF THE  EXPERIMENTS  IN  THE   WORLD  TO  DATE  HAVE  NOT  BEEN
       SUFFICIENTLY SENSITIVE TO  DETECT  THE  "ANTI-GRAVITY"  FORCE,  SAID
       PROFESSOR KEITH RUNCORN  LEADER OF THE RESEARCH TEAM, AT THE PHYSICS
       DEPARTMENT OF NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY.

       THE UNIVERSITY HAS  WON  SUPPORT   FROM   THE  SCIENCE  AND  NATURAL
       ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH  COUNCILS TO SET UP SENSITIVE GRAVITY-MEASURING
       INSTRUMENTS AROUND THE VAST DRY DOCKS IN PORTSMOUTH, SOUTHAMPTON AND
       BELFAST IN BRITAIN AS WELL AS BREST IN FRANCE.

       A CHANGE IN  THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD OCCURS WHEN THOUSANDS OF TONNES
       OF WATER POURING  THROUGH  THE  SLUICES  IS  MEASURED  DOWN  TO  ONE
       THOUSAND-MILLIONTH OF THE  STRENGTH  OF  THE  EARTH'S  GRAVITATIONAL
       FIELD.

       IF THE "ANTI-GRAVITY"  FORCE  EXISTS, THE INCREASE IN GRAVITY CAUSED
       BY THE WEIGHT  OF  WATER WILL BE  LESS  THAN  THAT  CALCULATED  WITH
       CONVENTIONAL THEORY.

       PROFESSOR RUNCORN EXPRESSED  HIS CONFIDENCE THAT THEY  COULD  DETECT
       THE VALUE OF THE "ANTI-GRAVITY" FORCE.

       THE FIRST SERIOUS  ATTEMPTS  TO  DETECT  THE FORCE AT THE DOCKS WILL
       BEGIN LATER THIS YEAR, THE NEWSPAPER SAID.

       THE "ANTI-GRAVITY" FORCE IS THOUGHT  TO  WEAKEN GRAVITY BY ABOUT ONE
       PERCENT OVER DISTANCES FROM A FEW YARDS TO ONE MILE.

       HOWEVER, PROFESSOR MICHAEL GREEN OF LONDON'S QUEEN  MARY COLLEGE, AN
       AUTHORITY ON THE THEORY OF THE FUNDAMENTAL FORCES OF NATURE, IS VERY
       SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE  EXISTENCE  OF  THE  "ANTI-GRAVITY"  FORCE,  THE
       NEWSPAPER ADDED.
