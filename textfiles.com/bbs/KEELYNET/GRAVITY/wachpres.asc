One of our contacts spoke with Mr. Wachspress about a year ago and he a free
flying SUPERCONDUCTING version actually uses the Earth's magnetic field to
provide free flight.  Demonstrations are available for $5000.  If the flying
device is allowed to ascend without restriction, it will move out of the
atmosphere.  Note this patent uses electromagnets to demonstrate the

                        FREE FLYING MAGNETIC LEVITATOR

BACKGROUND OF INVENTION

It is known in the art of magnetics that magnets and magnetic materials can
exert forces of attraction and/or repulsion between each other and various
magneto-mechanical devices are known, including flying systems such as
levitating trains.  These levitators require some form of linear guideway
to provide lateral stability and directional guidance.

Without such a guideway the interaction between opposing magnet systems would
terminate linear motion.  The levitator would no longer have suspension and
thrust, and would rotate to a static rest.

A novel levitator is herein provided that requires no guideway, is free
flying, self stabilized and fully maneuverable.

With regard to movement of the levitator hereof in space, it is noted that the
earth's magnetic field has substantially parallel lines of force over any
limited distance and the present invention provides for establishing an
interacting TRIPOLE magnetic field by forming the turns of magnetic fields
thereof perpendicularly to the circumference of the winding.

With such winds, interaction with the earth's magnetic field, for example,
results from coupling primarily through the vector potential field of the
levitator windings and obeys Ampere's longitudinal force law to indeed produce
substantial thrust in the "weak" magnetic field of the earth.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a levitator or flight unit incorporating a
number of magnets having an odd number of poles that is controllably movable
in an external magnetic field and which is herein embodied as a toy having a
tethered flight unit controllably movable in a magnetic field.

The term field generator is herein employed to define a principal magnetic
field source that the levitator interacts with.

It is known that a magnet having three poles may be formed by physically
connecting a pair of dipole magnets together with like poles contacting each
other.  This structure may then have, for example, north poles at each end and
a south pole at the center.  It has been commented by at least one researcher
that such structure has no useful purpose.

It is possible, however, to combine tripole magnets, for example, in such a
way that a net force is exerted thereon by an external magnetic field to the
end of moving the combination by magnetic forces and in fact to support and
move the combination in the space by such forces.

A simple combination of tripole electromagnetics is herein controllably
energized to not only levitate the combination in a magnetic field, but also
to controllably move the combination in the field.

Considering magnetic forces and interactions as an aid to understanding the
present invention, it is first noted that magneto-mechanical interactions are
the direct result of polar relationships.  Conventional magneto-mechanical
machines have an even number of active poles and can be explained by
elementary dipole-dipole interactions.  It is known that opposite poles
attract and like poles repel.

Two unrestrained dipoles may exhibit some repulsion temporarily, but will not
remain in stable opposition, as they inevitably rotate and attract each other.

A single isolated magnetic pole has been hypothesized as an elementary
particle but no single pole magnets have been adequately confirmed.

A hypothetical isolated magnetic pole would be attracted toward another
OPPOSITE monopole and repelled from a like monopole along a straight
trajectory.

A monopole would be attracted to one pole of the dipole and repelled by the
other pole and would follow a curvilenear trajectory.  A first dipole
magnet can be made to move across the field lines of a second if the field of
the first magnet is tapered, although a tapered dipole will also rotate as it
cuts across the field and will come to rest when in line with the other
field's force lines.

A three pole magnet, as employed in the present invention, exhibits many of
the characteristics of a monopole.  If the flux in both halves of a tripole
are equal, the opposite rotational moments thereof in a magnetic field will
balance each other.

However, in order to have linear motion between a tripole and a dipole, the
inner pole and outer poles of the tripole must have different effective
strengths and they should couple to the dipole field with different
efficiencies.  In essence, there should be weaker and stronger poles, i.e., a
pole differential.

Winding an electromagnetic tripole along two opposite horn or cone sections
with their throats meeting in the middle creates a greater magnetic flux
density in the middle pole because there are more turns per ampere of current
flow in the middle pole compared to the outer poles.  Also, the inner and
outer poles operate at different characteristic impedance (mostly reluctance
and inductive reactance) causing a differential of coupling efficiencies to
the external dipole field.  Without these acting on the tripole they would
balance each other and there would be no motion.

Another major factor determining the overall magnetomechanical performance of
the dipole-tripole interactions and all even pole-even pole, odd pole-odd pole
interactions is the overall impedance matching of opposing systems.  In most
magnetomechanical systems the gap between moving elements is very small the
loss of efficiency by poor impedance matching is insignificant so there has
been little investigation of the problem.

However, a free flying magnetic levitator generator system, with the flux in
the medium between them, where the gap between moving elements can be very
large, impedance matching becomes important.  A closer impedance match is a
function of the size, shape and materials of the opposing systems.  In the
case of an electromagnet tripole interacting with a permanent magnet dipole,
it is proposed that a coating of the winding wire of the tripole with
materials having a magnetic permeability larger than the wire but smaller than
the permanent magnet dipole would improve coupling efficiency and that such
permeability should be close to the permeability of the medium between both
systems.

The use of coating to improve the performance of a system is common practice
in other technologies, although the correlations to magnetic levitators have
been evidenced only by rudimentary demonstration.  The electromagnet tripole
is not limited to employing slowly varying direct electrical currents, but can
employ all types of modulated alternating currents, hence the levitator
becomes a cross between a motor and antenna.

The permanent magnet dipole has certain characteristic electromagnetic
resonances and a dynamic antenna motor tripole serving as a levitator will
interact dynamically with the dipole as well as statistically; however, such
theory and application is still only rudimentarily developed.  However, the
static odd pole even pole interactions of novel value are more clearly
demonstrated and explained above.

Free flying magnetic levitators can be configured from two tripoles disposed
perpendicularly to each other, as well as other combinations of tripoles, five
pole magnets and other odd pole combinations.  A simple magnetic levitator is
a full embellishment of Coulombs law for magnetomechanical systems:

           F sub FL = KC sub (PHI) F (PHI) L = U sub m to R squared

Where F= force between the levitator and the field generator,
      C=coupling efficiency,
      (PHI)F=magnetic flux of the field generator,
      (PHI)L=magnetic flux of the levitator,
      U sub m=permeability of the medium,
      r=distance between the levitator and the field generator,
      K=universal magnetic constant (for compatability of units).

This law is applicable to all permanent and electromagnets operating as motors
or generators.

It will be seen that the flight unit may be controlled, not only to hover in
an exterior magnetic field or the field of an exterior field generator also to
make all of the motions possible with conventional flying devices such as an
airplane.

One operating the present invention may thus move the flight unit about in the
surrounding magnetic field.  It will of corse, be appreciated that the
controls of the control unit may be set up in a variety of ways, possibly for
example, by providing separate joy sticks for (each axis)

If the current in a wire loop is considered to be in 3D space, the magnetic
field around the wire is the vector curl of the current and exists some
further dimension that might be considered to as in 4D space.

If the magnetic field around the wire is considered to be in 4D space the
vector potential field around the magnetic field is the vector curl of the
magnetic field and exists some further dimension that might be considered as
in 5D space.

Many more fields are nested in fields of higher dimensionality but only two
are known to demonstrate macroscopic forces of interaction, magnetic fields
via many common linear and rotational motors and vector potential fields.

It will be appreciated that levitation for any substantial distance in the
earth's magnetic field is best accomplished without physical connection of the
levitator to the ground or power supply.  This can be accomplished by
providing the levitator itself with a self contained power supply.  Such a
power supply may energize the windings of the levitator magnets with
electrical energy stored in the windings.

Considering this matter..it is noted that force, F, applied to a current
carrying conductor in a magnetic field, B, is proportional to Bli, wherein l
is the length of the conductor and i is current flowing through the conductor.

Interactions with the relatively weak earth's magnetic field produces
levitation and motion of the levitator hereof may best be accomplished by
causing a very large current to flow through the windings of the electromagnet
thereof.

Reference is made in this respect to FIG. 16 illustrating a curve of critical
current versus magnetic field strength.  Commonly motors are operated in the
range wherein the current is relatively low and the field strength is
relatively high.  Inasmuch as the field strength of the earth's magnetic field
is known to be quite low, the present invention operates upon an entirely
different portion of the curve, as indicated, for example, at C thereon
wherein a very large current is employed.

The current carrying capacity of electrical conductors is known to be related
to the resistance thereof, and in order to achieve truly high current density,
the present invention employs conductors having extremely small or
substantially zero resistance, i.e., superconductors.

One known superconductor of use here is niobium-titanium that may comprise an
alloy containing 48% titanium and a superconductor so comprised preferably
includes copper cladding of full annealed copper.  Superconducting properties
of alloys are generally considered to be attainable only at very reduced
temperatures although recent research indicates that some types of conductors
may exhibit superconducting properties at higher temperatures.

There is schematically illustrated in FIG. 17 a levitator incorporating a
tripole magnet or tripole magnet and cryostat.  The cryostat includes an outer
insulated envelope providing heat insulating for the interior thereof and an
interior shell mounting the tripole magnet.  A vacuum connection is provided
to evacuate the interior of the envelope and shell, and a fill and vent line
extends to the rear exterior of the envelope with a valve therein.  A switch
is electrically connected between the terminals of the tripole and terminals
exterior to the envelope.

In accordance with conventional practice the cryostat is first evacuated and
then charged with liquid helium through the valve.  The tripole is then
charged by an external power supply through the switch which is connected
accross the windings to prevent shorting of the power supply during charging.
After disconnection of the power supply the valve is opened to vent the liquid
helium so as to bring the temperature therein to a very low temperature by
boiling of the liquid helium.

Actuation of the switch then causes a circulating current to flow through the
windings of the tripole against substantially zero resistance so that this
current then persists to produce the above noted magnetic field about the
tripole which couples with the earth's magnetic field to cause forces of
interaction which move or levitate the levitator.  It will, of course, be
appreciated that this levitator may, and preferably does, include a pair of
orthogonal disposed tripoles, however, only a single tripole is illustrated in
FIG. 17 for ease of illustration and description.

The levitator of FIG. 17 may, for example, comprise a small space vehicle with
the outer shell being formed of aluminum sheet having dimension of ten inches
in length by two and half inches in diameter with the motor comprising a pair
of tripole windings of niobium-titanium wire having a one inch diameter and
two inch length.

With the structure weighing one ounce and the motor weighing three ounces, a
refrigerant in the form of two ounces of liquid helium may be provided therein
to provide a total weight at lift off of 6 ounces.

Such a unit may have a total thrust at lift off of 9 ounces with an altitude
at burnout of three miles and a velocity of twenty five hundreds of miles per
hour at such burnout.  Steering of such a unit may be accomplished by
controlled passage of some current through an orthogonal winding of aluminum
wire, for example, which exhibits some resistance at the temperature of
operation of the unit so as to provide desired lateral forces of interaction
with the earth's magnetic field.

The tripole magnet field hereof with longitudinally wound toroidial windings
as shown, for example, in FIG. 13, may also be formed by placing the
conductors upon a deformable form that may be similar to the structure of FIG.
10 wherein the ends of the winds are capable of being rotated.  A winding may
thus be formed as elongated turns in a cylindrical shape, as shown at A of
FIG. 18.  End discs or rings are then controllably rotated in opposite
directions to twist the winding into a pair of frusto-conical shapes having
contiguous small ends, as shown at B of FIG. 18.

Appropriate electrical connections are made to the windings as noted above and
the tripole electromagnet may thus be readily controlled as to taper of the
windings for establishing a desired differential field strengths between the
center and ends thereof.

It will be appreciated that there has been described above a free flying
magnetic levitator having extended capabilities not only for producing usable
forces of interaction with generated electrical fields but also with the
earth's magnetic field.  It is further noted that the present invention
particularly as described in the above noted example of a levitator in
accordance herewith may be scaled up to larger sizes with increased
efficiencies and the capablilties of lifting substantial payloads.

It is also noted that the toroidal windings of FIGS. 13 and 14 may be employed
in each of the configurations described and illustrated for the winding of
FIG. 2, for example. Thus the present invention does provide a material
advancement in the field of space vehicles whether such space be considered as
the space above a desktop or as the space about the earth, and beyond.

Vanguard Notes

The magnetic fields are produced by an interesting geometry which is key to
the entire patent claim showing how a magnetic monopole can be constructed and
used in a practical application.

To get a better idea of how it works, you draw a 'cross' on a piece of paper,
then imagine a line drawn vertically through the center, you will have 6
radial lines.

Tapered coils are wound on each of these six arms and energized so that the
same pole is located at the center.  That is, South pole only on the inside
and North pole ONLY on the outside (or vice versa).  Thus, you have an
'artificial monopole' as a direct result of the geometry.

By controlling the current flow through one or more of these conical coils,
the device can be caused to move in the desired direction.

The interactions between the magnetic fields can be so adjusted as to cause
the device to tilt.  If it is 'floating' as a result of a repelling field
(which would be located on the bottom for now...<g>), it works like a boat on
water.  When constructed of superconducting materials, it will float in the
air as it repels against the earth's very weak magnetic field.

For demonstration purposes according to the patent diagram, a coil is provided
on the bottom to provide a repelling field.  The device initially sits on this
platform when no power is applied to the floater.  When the floater is powered
up and since it is of LIKE polarity in a monopolar configuration, it is
repelled from the bottom plate freely floats in the air.

Though this is NOT true gravity control, it offers a unique means of
'steering' such a device when we get to that inevitable stage.  Additionally,
the idea of creating such an intense monopolar repulsion that a device could
actually work against the earth's natural magnetic field is amazing in itself.

The effects of such high density magnetic fields on living organisms might not
make this a 'desired' means of flight, though it does not rule out use of it
for payload delivery systems for space, upper atmosphere beacons or
transmitters, eye-in-the-sky surveillance systems, etc...........>>>  Jerry
