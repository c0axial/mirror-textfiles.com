                    CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BIEFELD-BROWN EFFECT
                    -------------------------------------------

       The Biefeld-Brown effect  produces  an  anti-gravity effect when the
       positive polarity electric  charge  exceeds  the  negative  polarity
       charge of the mass.

       Electricity, magnetism, and  gravitation are three separate  forces,
       yet each is  dependent  on the other to produce effects analogous to
       all of them.

       The closer the plates of a condenser  are  to each other the greater
       the effect.

       The higher the "K" or electric stress of the insulation  between the
       plates the greater is the effect.

       The greater the  area  of  the  plates  of  a condenser the more the
       effect will be.  The more voltage  on  the  plates  will also give a
       greater effect.

       A free-to-move condenser will always move in the  direction  of  the
       positive polarity side.   The  greater  the  mass  of  the  material
       between the plates the greater will be the effect.

       A charged condenser produces thrust without having any moving parts.

       An anti-gravity field  will collapse  if  it  is  within  "grounding
       distance" of the Earth.  This is roughly one-quarter of the diameter
       of the field.

       In ion propulsion  the  frequencies in the orange spectrum  will  be
       found to produce maximum results.

       Gravity will decrease as pressure proportionately relative to the
       charge of the mass of a body or planet.

       Control of gravity will be best effected at points of 120 of arc.

       Electro-static sources such as the Van de Graff and Wimshurst
       machines are required for anti-gravity research.
