The following article seems to be worth adding to the KeelyNet database in
light of recent assessments and correlations.  Over the past year, my approach
towards achieving anti-gravity has changed from one of seeking to produce
outright levitation to a more realistic goal of reducing the weight of a mass.
This change in approach was primarily triggered by the weight reduction
experiments of FARROW back in the early 1900's.

It appears electrical energy can be somehow applied to matter to reduce or
redirect the flow of gravity through or around a mass.  Graham Hancock claims
to have tracked down the Ark of the Covenant in Ethiopia as detailed in his
superb book, 'The Sign and the Seal'.  There are many wondrous ruins in
Ethiopia, one of which is a valley of Stellae, huge obelisks (like the
Washington Monument), some made of single pieces of stone.  One of these
stones is almost 600 feet high and is carved from one gigantic rock, then
stood on end.  This obelisk still stands today in Ethiopia.

When Hancock was speaking with the high priest who is charged with taking care
of the Ark, the priest commented on the 'mysterious powers of the Ark'.
Hancock asked what was the nature of these powers, to which the priest
replied, "did you pass through the valley of the stellae?...and did you not
wonder how such gigantic stones could be erected in ancient times?  They were
erected using the 'celestial fire' that emanates from the Ark!"

The Ark of the Covenant is suspected of being a very large Leyden jar which
accumulates its energy from atmospheric electricity.  There are also those who
claim the Ark was used as a power source in conjunction with pyramids, to
produce some kind of beam.  It is my opinion that the 'celestial fire' of the
Ark is electrical energy that could be projected into a mass, such as a large
stone in the form of a block, obelisk or other shape.  This energy, properly
applied, can cause a mass to lose a large part of it's weight, thus making it
much easier to move and requiring substantially less energy in the process.

Recently, while having dinner with Toby Grotz, Tim Binder and Ron Kovac, I
brought up this subject which prompted Toby to inform me of a discovery he,
Ron and Tim had made.  Toby said they had discovered a most interesting
Egyptian heiroglyph but which they did not have with them at the moment.

Toby drew a picture of it which showed two men, each holding a glass capsule
about the size of a Hoover cannister vacuum.  The front end, pointing outward
and away from the men, was curved as in the bottom of a test tube, the rear
end had a cable attached to it, thick and indicating a high dielectric for the
passage of high voltage.  Inside these glass cylinders, were what appeared to
be lightning bolts, apparently charging with the intent of being 'fired' at
something.

Most gravity researchers I have met, have come to understand that gravity is
not an attractive force, but a celestial repulsive force and that we are HELD
DOWN on the planet by an incoming 'wind' which also holds mass together, it
follows that this wind can be re-directed around a mass to reduce the effect
we call 'weight'.  (other phenomena also occur)

Both of these items indicate high voltage can somehow alter the flow of
gravity for reduced weight in the affected mass.  The large stones used to
build many ancient monuments could thus be easily moved, like giant styrofoam
blocks, once the weight was REDUCED, rather than CANCELLED outright.

The same phenomena of weight reduction can be achieved using sound or other
energies as evidenced by Keely's Airship demonstration to the US War
Department in 1896, the Tibetan Monk levitation of stone blocks in the 1920s,
more recently, the 1950's construction of Edward Leedskalnin's Coral Castle in
Homestead, Florida and others which I won't boar you with.

Imagine, WHEN, (not IF) we REDISCOVER how to re-direct the 'flow' of gravity,
we can put on a belt, reduce our body weight to 2 pounds or so, and jump over
a building.  We don't lose STRENGTH, just weight.  With wings, we could FLY
THROUGH THE AIR as easily as we swim through water.  With a controllable means
of propulsion, the flying abilities of the Rocketeer and Buck Rogers will
become TOMORROW'S realities.

I have several reports over the centuries of FLYING MEN who were seen to fly
through the air, some with wings, some with mechanical contrivances.  This is
easily achievable if the weight of the person is reduced by energetic or other
means.  Other reports indicate a mysterious gas, generated from coal which had
amazing lifting abilities when heated (see the Aero and Air ship files).

It is my opinion that there are groups and individuals over the centuries who
have discovered how to control natural forces and chosen to restrict the
information to a select few.  There are hints, many of which are related as
fantastic stories, that when correlated, show points of coincidence indicating
that which we barely suspect, let alone acknowledge, that there exists one or
more advanced and highly secret groups.

I suspect new members are invited to join and then put through rigorous tests
of loyalty to ensure information imparted from the group will not be discussed
or documented for public consumption.  The threat of death is used to ensure
loyalty and silence as reported to be the case with the Sonora Aero Club who
in turn were affiliated with a mystery group from New York called NYMZA.  Each
member took an oath of absolute secrecy, understanding they would forfeit
their life should they break that oath.

But we who PUBLICLY study and SHARE such information are not restricted by
such fears.  As long as we continue to share our findings, correlations, ideas
and results of experiments as GLOBALLY as possible, we WILL rediscover and
practically utilize these phenomena to improve our lives.

                             How I Control Gravity
                             by T. Townsend Brown

(an early article by Brown dealing, as the article preface said, "with the
meaning of the Einstein "Field Theories" and the relation between electro-
dynamics and gravitation.")

There is a decided tendency in the physical sciences to unify the great basic
laws and to relate by a single structure or mechanism such individual
phenomenon as gravitation, electrodynamics and even matter itself.  It is
found that matter and electricity are very closely related in structure.

In the final analysis, matter loses its traditional individuality and becomes
'an electrical condition'.  In fact, it might be said that the concrete body
of the universe is nothing more than an assemblage of energy which, in itself,
is quite intangible.  Of course, it is self-evident that matter is connected
with gravitation, and it follows logically that electricity is likewise
connected.

These relations exist in the realm of pure energy and consequently the true
backbone of the universe.  It is needless to say that the relations are not
simple.  Unfortunately at present they are not even well understood.  The
handicap is the outstanding lack of information on the real nature of
gravitation.

The THEORY OF RELATIVITY lends a new and revolutionary light to the subject by
injecting a new conception of space and time.  Gravitation thus becomes the
natural outcome of so-called "distorted space".  It loses the Newtonian
interpretation as a tangible mechanical force and gains the rank of an
"apparent" force, due merely to the condition of space itself.

Fields in space are produced by the presence of material bodies or electric
charges.  They are gravitational fields or electric fields, according to their
causes.  Apparently they have no connection, one with the other.  This fact is
substantiated by observations to the effect that electric fields can be
shielded and annulled while gravitational fields are nearly perfectly
penetrating.  This dissimilarity has been the chief hardship to those who
would compose a theory of combination.

It has required Dr. Einstein's own close study for a period of several years
to achieve the results others have sought in vain and to announce with
certainty the unitary field laws.

Einstein's new field theory is purely mathematical.  It is not based on the
results of any laboratory test and does not, so far as now known, predict any
method by which an actual demonstration or proof may be made.  The new theory
accomplishes its purpose by "rounding out" the accepted Principles of
Relativity so as to embrace electrical phenomena.

The Theory of Relativity thus supplemented represents the last word in
mathematical physics.  It is most certainly a theoretical structure of
overpowering magnitude and importance.  The thought involved is so far
reaching that it may be MANY YEARS before the work is fully appreciated and
understood.

However, Dr. Einstein's announcement of his recent work has spirited the
physicists of the entire world to locate and demonstrate, if possible, any
structural relationship between electro-dynamics and gravitation.  It is not
that they questioned or doubted Einstein's reasoning or his mathematics (for
they have learned better), but that they realized that the relation should
exist and were eager to find it.

Early Investigations

The writer and his colleagues anticipated the present situation as early as
1923, and began at that time to construct the necessary theoretical bridge
between the two then separate phenomena, electricity and gravitation.  The
work was slow at first, due to the scarcity of information and lack of proper
equipment, but the search gained speed as it gained information.

The first actual demonstration was made in 1924.  Observations were made of
the individual and combined motions of two heavy LEAD BALLS which were
suspended by wires 45 cm. apart.

The balls were given opposite electrostatic charges and the charges were
maintained.  Sensitive optical methods were employed in measuring the
movements, and as near as could be observed the balls appeared to behave
according to the following law:

  "Any system of two bodies possesses a mutual and uni-directional force
   (generally in the line of the bodies) which is directly proportional to the
   product of the masses, directly proportional to the potential difference
   and INVERSELY proportional to the square of the distance between them."

It will be noted that this law is merely a combination and slight variation of
Newton's law of gravitation and Coulomb's law of electrostatic attraction.  In
the specific text of this law the movement is in the negative to positive
direction.

THE PECULIAR RESULT IS THAT THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD OF THE EARTH HAD NO
"APPARENT" CONNECTION WITH THE EXPERIMENT.  THE GRAVITATIONAL FACTORS ENTERED
THROUGH THE CONSIDERATION OF THE MASS OF THE ELECTRIFIED BODIES.

The newly discovered force was quite obviously the resultant physical effect
of electro-gravitational interaction.  It represented the first ACTUAL
EVIDENCE of the very basic relationship.  The force was named "gravitator
action" for want of a better term and the apparatus or system of masses was
called a "gravitator."

Since the time of the first test, the apparatus and the methods have been
greatly improved and simplified.  Cellular "gravitators" have taken the place
of the large balls of lead.  Rotating frames supporting two and four
gravitators have made possible acceleration measurements.

Molecular gravitators made of solid blocks of MASSIVE DIELECTRIC have given
still greater efficiency.  Rotors and pendulums operating under oil have
eliminated atmospheric conditions as to pressure, temperature and humidity.

The disturbing effects of ionization, electron emission, and pure electro-
statics have likewise been carefully analyzed and eliminated.  Finally after
many years of tedious work and with refinement of methods we succeeded in
observing gravitational variations produced by the different planets.  It is a
curious fact that the effects are MOST pronounced when the affecting body is
in the alignment of the differently charged elements and LEAST pronounced when
it is AT RIGHT ANGLES.

Much of the credit for this research is due to Dr. Paul Biefield, Director of
Swasey Observatory.  The writer is deeply indebted to him for his assistance
and for his many valuable and timely suggestions.

Gravitator Action an Impulse

Let us take, for example, the case of a gravitator totally immersed in oil but
suspended so as to act as a pendulum and swing along the line of its elements.

When the direct current with high voltage (75KV to 300KV) is applied the
gravitator swings up the arc until its propulsive force balances the force of
the earth's gravity resolved to that point, then it stops, but it does not
remain there.

The pendulum then GRADUALLY RETURNS to the vertical or starting position even
while the POTENTIAL IS MAINTAINED.  The pendulum swings only to one side of
the vertical.

Less than five seconds is required for the test pendulum to reach the maximum
amplitude of the swing but from thirty to eighty seconds are required for it
TO RETURN to zero.

The total time or the duration of the impulse VARIES with such COSMIC
CONDITIONS as the relative position and distance of the moon, sun and so
forth.  It is IN NO WAY affected by fluctuations in the supplied voltage and
averages the same for every mass or material under test.  The duration of the
impulse is governed solely by the condition of the gravitational field.  It is
a value which is unaffected by changes in the experimental set-up, voltage
applied or type of gravitator employed.

Any number of different kinds of gravitators operating simultaneously on
widely different voltages would reveal exactly the same impulse duration at
any instant.  Over an extended period of time all gravitators would show equal
readings and equal variations in the duration of the impulse.

After the gravitator is once fully discharged, its impulse exhausted, the
electrical potential must be REMOVED for AT LEAST 5 minutes in order that it
may recharge itself and regain its normal GRAVIC CONDITION.

           (refer Puthoff on ZPE as being the 'cause of inertia' and
                    Aspden with ZPE entrainment experiment,
                   note that ZPE is another term for Aether)

The effect is much like that of discharging and charging a storage battery,
except that the electricity is handled in a REVERSE manner.  When the duration
of the impulse is great, the time required for complete recharge is likewise
great.

The times of discharge and recharge are ALWAYS PROPORTIONAL.  Technically
speaking, the EXO-gravic rate and ENDO-gravic rate are proportional to the
gravic CAPACITY.

Summing up the observations of the electro-gravic pendulum the following
characteristics are noted:

  APPLIED VOLTAGE - determines only the amplitude of the swing
  APPLIED AMPERAGE - is only sufficient to overcome leakage and maintain the
     required voltage through the losses in the dielectric.  Thus the total
     load approximates only 37 ten-millionths of an ampere.  It apparently has
     no other relation to the movement, at least from the present state of
     physics.
  MASS - of the dielectric is a factor in determining the total energy
     involved in the impulse.  For a given amplitude an increase in mass is
     productive of an increase in the energy exhibited by the system (E=mg).
  DURATION OF THE IMPULSE - with electrical conditions maintained, is
     independent of all the foregoing factors.  It is governed solely by
     external gravitational conditions, positions of the moon, sun, etc., and
     represents the total energy or summation of energy values or levels which
     are effective at that instant.
  GRAVITATIONAL ENERGY LEVELS - are observable as the pendulum returns from
     the maximum deflection to the zero point or vertical position.  The
     pendulum hesitates in its return movement on definite levels or steps.
     The relative position and influence of these steps vary continuously
     every minute of the day.  One step or energy value corresponds in effect
     to each cosmic body that is influencing the electrified mass of the
     gravitator.  By merely tracing a succession of paths, the relative
     gravitational effects of the moon, sun, etc., may be obtained.

In general then, every material body possesses inherently within its substance
separate and distinct energy levels corresponding to the gravitational
influences of every other body.  These levels are readily revealed as the
electro-gravic impulse dies and as the total gravic content of the body is
SLOWLY RELEASED.

The gravitator, in all reality, is a very efficient electric motor.  Unlike
other forms of motors it does not in any way invoke the principles of electro-
magnetism, but instead it utilizes the newer principle of electro-gravitation.

A simple gravitator has no moving parts but is apparently capable of moving
itself FROM WITHIN ITSELF.  It is highly efficient for the reason that it uses
no gears, shafts, propellers or wheels in creating its motive power.  It has
no internal mechanical resistance and no observable rise in temperature.

(this is analogous to the 'Inertial Drives' of Cook and Thornsen wherein a
uni-directional force is produced using mechanical means)

Contrary to the popular belief that gravitational motors must NECESSARILY be
vertical-acting the gravitator, it is found, acts equally well in every
conceivable direction.

While the gravitator is at present primarily a scientific instrument, perhaps
even an astronomical instrument, it also is rapidly advancing to a position of
commercial value.

Multi-impulse gravitators weighing HUNDREDS OF TONS may propel the ocean
liners of the future.  Smaller and more concentrated units may propel
automobiles and even airplanes.  Perhaps even the fantastic "space cars" and
the promised visit to Mars may be the final outcome.  Who can tell?
