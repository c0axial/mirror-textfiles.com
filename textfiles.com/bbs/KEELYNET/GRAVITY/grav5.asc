                                  Weighty Matters

                    Could Newton's 300-year-old law of gravity
                           finally be succumbing to age?

       Several recent findings seem to deviate from the theory, and now the
       most meticulous test  yet--a  measurement of the gravitational field
       in a mile-deep borehole in the Greenland  ice  sheet--has  turned up
       further evidence of a discrepancy.

       The implications could  be  profound.   Such  small  adjustments  to
       gravity are in  fact predicted by all the most promising attempts to
       forge a unified theory of the fundamental  forces--the ultimate goal
       of physics.

       These new effects, which some people call a fifth force  and  even a
       sixth force, are  expected  to  compare  to gravity in strength, but
       they act over perhaps a few hundred  or thousands of meters, whereas
       gravity has an infinite range.

       One possibile consequence  of such new effects is  that  within  the
       range of the  new  forces, Newton's inverse-square law (the strength
       of gravity falls as the square of  the  distance between two masses)
       may not be true.

       Another is that unlike standard gravity, which acts  only  on  mass,
       the new effects   may   depend   on   some  aspect  of  an  object's
       composition, such as the total number of baryons (protons and
       neutrons).

       Nearly a dozen  experiments  have sought--inconclusively--to  detect
       one of the effects (see "Force of a Different Color" in "Science and
       the Citizen," December, 1987). The Greenland project  is  the latest
       in a series  of attempts to detect a violation of the inverse-square
       law by measuring local gravitational  fields  and  comparing them to
       calculations based on the density of the surrounding terrain.

       An earlier experiment  done  inside  an  Australian   mine  found  a
       repulsive effect of  roughly  1  percent of the strength of ordinary
       gravity, acting over a range of a few hundred meters.

                                      Page 1





       A second experiment,  carried out on a 600-meter television tower in
       North Carolina, found an attractive effect of about 2 percent of the
       strength of gravity acting over a distance of 300 meters.

       The calculations worked out even better WHEN BOTH AND ATTRACTIVE AND
       A REPULSIVE EFFECT WERE PRESUMNED.

       Skeptics argue that  these  apparent   effects   could  result  from
       anomalies in local mass density, such as a hidden lode of metal ore.

       The Greenland group, led by Mark E. Ander of the Los Alamos National
       Laboratory and Mark A. Zumberge of the University of  California  at
       San Diego, therefore chose a highly homogeneous site: a borehole
       surrounded by a two-kilometer-thick expanse of ice.

       The team took  elaborate  precautions:  the  bedrock  was  mapped by
       42,000 high-frequency radar scans,  and  careful  surveys determined
       the height of the ice surface to within a centimeter.

       A gravimeter took more than 100 readings at half a  dozen locations,
       at depths of between 200 and 1,600 meters.

       The researchers assumed  the  density  of  the  bedrock  might range
       between 2.7 and three grams per cubic  centimeter; densities outside
       this range are geologically improbable.  Finally, different  members
       analyzed the data at least three times.

       Their preliminary conclusion:

            there appears to be a single, attractive effect whose
            strength is between 1.7 and 3.9 percent that of gravity.

            It is  thought  to  act over a distance of somewhere between 10
            meters and slightly more than one kilometer.

       The new findings agree with the results from North Carolina but seem
       to contradict those from Australia.  It may be possible to reconcile
       all three results by including both an attractive and a repulsive
       effect, but then the theoretical model "gets rather contrived,"
       according to Ander's colleague Richard Hughes.

       To help determine whether these  effects  are  real  or  are instead
       caused by hidden anomalies in the environment, the  group is already
       planning future experiments  in the Pacific Ocean and in Antarctica,
       where the ice is twice as thick as the ice in Greenland.
