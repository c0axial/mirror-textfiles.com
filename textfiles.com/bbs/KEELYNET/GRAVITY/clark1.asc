                                   GRAVITY NOTES

                  by Richard L. Clark, Ph.D. -  7 December, 1984

       The systems of universal energy flow, fields are in three dimensions
       only (three axes).   The  three currently recognized field flows are
       the electric, magnetic and gravitational.

       At the neutral centers, mid polar position, of each of these fields,
       and rotated 90 degrees from them,  are  the  cross fields, which are
       the dielectric, diamagnetic, and diagravitational fields.

       Thus, each directional flow axis has two energy flow  fields.  As an
       example, gravity and  the  diamagnetic  energy flows are both in the
       arbitrary Z axis.

       All six energy fields are thus coupled in one system.

       All of the  coaxial pairs of these  six  energy  flow  systems,  are
       modulating oscillations in the three axes, carried by the ether.

       The ether itself is an extremely tenuous and elastic  "carrier wave"
       medium, which oscillates in a frequency and mode of its own.

       Due to the  dual  field impressions carried in each flow axis by the
       ether, we can and do cause interference radial shifts in these axial
       flow systems.

       As an example, increasing the local  diamagnetic field does decrease
       the local gravity  field.   This is, in fact, what  Schauberger  was
       doing in his hydrodynamic systems.

       As Albert Roy  Davis has proved many times, any diamagnetic material
       placed midway between attracting magnetic  poles loses gravitational
       weight.  This happens  only  at  the neutral center,  the  mid-point
       between the attracting  poles,  which  is  the exact location of the
       diamagnetic field.

       Thus, as the  magnitude  of  the diamagnetic  field  increases,  the
       magnitude (and effect)  of  the  gravity  field  decreases.    These
       statements may be  verified  with  any  diamagnetic sample suspended
       from a spring  scale  and  two powerful  permanent  magnets  in  the
       spaced, attracting position.
                                      Page 1
       The electrical field  is  coaxial  with  the  diagravity  field  and
       explains T.T. Brown's capacitor units.  A large DC power supply, two
       spaced metal plates (a capacitor)  and  any  good  dielectric sample
       suspended from a  spring scale will demonstrate this  phase  of  the
       system.

       The fourth parameter is not time; it is oscillatory motion!

       Time is only an arbitrary interval in a sequence of events and not a
       dimension of existence.   The universe is composed of information in
       various forms of oscillations as to frequency, direction and mode.

       The technology involved is to transfer  useful  energy gains between
       these fields by purposeful interference.

       NOTE:  The universe is infinite and unbounded and not the
              "Divine Smoke-ring" of Eddington's torus equation.  Euclid
              was right about parallel lines.  Mathematics  is  a synthetic
              language and  should  not be mistaken for reality.  It can be
              an artificial tool or toy, but never real.

       Recommended Tests:

       Check for a weight change, if any, for each of the following
       conditions:

           1.  Diamagnetic (bismuth) in an attracting magnetic field.
           2.  Iron midway in an attracting magnetic field.
           3.  Diamagnetic (bismuth) in a repelling magnetic field.
           4.  Iron midway in repelling magnetic field.
