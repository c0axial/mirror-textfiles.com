                         Superconducting Whirls of Plasma
                                        by
                                  Hans Lauritzen

       During recent years  research on Magneto-Hydro-Dynamics has provided
       humanity with a  great  number  of   discoveries   of  new  physical
       phenomena.  It has not been possible to predict these phenomena.  We
       find ourselves at  the  beginning of a STARTLING development,  whose
       consequences are of immense importance for the future of humanity on
       planet Earth.

       When a plasma is COMPRESSED by VERY STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS, it has a
       tendency to form  special shapes (PLASMOIDS).  The shapes assumed by
       plasmoids are unexpectedly  rich   and   have  provided  information
       considerably in advance of the ability of theory to predict.

       A commonly observed  hydro-magnetic  property  of   plasma   is  the
       tendency of the   plasma   to  spontaneously  form  SHREDS  or  THIN
       filaments.  These filaments often  form  SPIRALS in the container or
       magnetic bottles in which the plasma is ACCELERATED.

       When a plasma with high electrical potential is compressed by a very
       strong magnetic field,  and  WHEN  AT THE SAME TIME  a  very  strong
       magnetic field is created INSIDE and ALONG the axis of the COLUMN OF
       PLASMA, the particles  of  the  plasma  will  MOVE  IN TIGHT SPIRALS
       around and along the magnetic lines of force.

       Associated with this CORKSCREW MOVEMENT are two important qualities;
       the number of revolutions per plasma  density  is  so  high that the
       number of distant-encounter collisions per second EXCEEDS  THE GYRO-
       FREQUENCY, the cork-cut  takes  place, so to speak, transforming the
       tight spirals into a great number of RING-SHAPED PLASMA WHIRLS.

       These ring-shaped plasma whirls ARE SUPERCONDUCTING!!!

       As the electrical potential in them  is  enormous  and  now does not
       encounter ANY RESISTANCE, VERY POWERFUL HYDRO-MAGNETIC  SHOCK  WAVES
       ARE EMITTED!!

       For many years  superconductors were thought of simply as substances
       whose electrical resistance vanishes  below  a  certain temperature.
       This concept met   with   a   number   of   minor  but   significant
       difficulties, which eventually   led   to   the   realization   that
       superconductivity represents a state  of  matter  in  which  a large
       number of electrons are in a COHERENT STATE OF MOTION.

       Such a state can persist INDEFINITELY in flagrant violation  of  the
       classical law that  a  circulating  electron  MUST  LOSE  ENERGY  BY
       RADIATION!

       A typical property of superconductors  is  their  IMPENETRABILITY TO
       MAGNETISM!!  (the Meissner effect...Vangard)

       As the ring-shaped  whirls of plasma are super-conducting,  MAGNETIC
       FIELDS CANNOT PENETRATE  THEM,  and  they are actually IMPRISONED in
       their own magnetic  fields  (and  those  of  the  other  neighboring
       whirls).


                                      Page 2





       That is why a ring-shaped current can remain stable INDEFINITELY
       and AT THE  SAME TIME emit powerful hydrodynamic shock waves WITHOUT
       A SUPPLY OF ENERGY.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Vangard note...

            Remember the "perpetual lights"  found  in ancient tombs, which
            when exposed to sunlight would go out and not restart.

            What if these "perpetual lights" are these ring  currents which
            have been  circulating  for  centuries.  The hydrodynamic shock
            waves would cause a crystal coating  to pulse at high amplitude
            to generate a piezoelectric light.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       These ring currents  of  superconducting  plasma   present   certain
       analogies with the ring currents created in superfluid helium (below
       2.2 degrees K)  when  bombarded with alpha particles, and with smoke
       rings.

       Because of these dramatic macroscopic  quantum  effects exhibited by
       the superconducting ring currents, they can under certain conditions
       pave (tunnelling.....Vangard) their way through the  containers  and
       escape from the  laboratories without interruption of their coherent
       state of motion.  They will then FOLLOW MAGNETIC LINES OF FORCE.

       In a separate paper I have mentioned  that  such  ring  currents are
       created in the  magnetosphere  due  to  the INTERACTION  OF  IONIZED
       PARTICLE WAVES from the sun and the geo-magnetic field of the Earth.

       Earth's magnetic lines  of force TRAP THE WAVES of charged particles
       and CAUSE THEM TO MOVE IN SPIRALS.   Under  certain  conditions  the
       spirals become so tight that HUGE superconducting ring  currents are
       created.

       When the superconducting ring currents consist of TRAPPED LOW-ENERGY
       PROTONS, they CAUSE  ELECTROMAGNETIC  RADIATION  at  frequencies  of
       about one cycle of second.

       And ring currents  of  trapped electrons  give  frequencies  in  the
       AUDIBLE RANGE, which is from 20 cycles to 15,000 cycles per second.

       The luminous phenomena  are also called "HASER" an acronym  standing
       for Hydro-Magnetic Amplification    by    Stimulated   Emission   of
       Radiation.  It is to be remembered  that  the  particles  are  in  a
       COHERENT state of motion in the ring currents.

       A great number  of  ring  currents,  are  often COMBINED  INTO  HUGE
       LUMINOUS CIGAR-SHAPED FIELDS,  but they can also separate and appear
       as smaller OVAL SHAPES or quite SMALL LUMINOUS BALLS.

       Due to perturbations of the magnetic  lines  of  force they can move
       NEARER TO THE  SURFACE  of  the Earth.  Such strange  bright  lights
       (Unidentified Flying Objects) have been seen by millions of people.

       The shapes reported   correspond   very   well   to  the  shapes  of
       superconducting ring currents.  As they are very SENSITIVE to

                                      Page 3





       magnetic lines of force, they have often been reported hovering over
       or moving along powerful electric current wires.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Vangard note...

            Note in  the  preceding  paragraph the mention of how SENSITIVE
            these PLASMOID shapes are to magnetic lines of force.  Remember
            Tesla's experiment with the  sensitive  electric  flame  (is  a
            plasma not also a flame)???  Does this not ring a bell??

            Also in  specific  relation  to UFO encounters,  the  Persinger
            experiment (listed  on  KeelyNet  as MIND5) shows how very weak
            pulsating magnetic fields can increase HYPNOTIC SUSCEPTIBILITY.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       When following the magnetic lines  of  force of Earth, the path will
       LOOK LIKE A ZIGZAG LINE.  They will also tend to move  along certain
       GEOGRAPHIC LINES because  of DEVIATIONS of the GEOMAGNETIC FIELD due
       to deposits of magnetic material in the Earth (orthotheny).

              (refer to the researches of  Bruce  Cathie and how he derived
               his system based originally on tracking the path of UFOs ---
               --Vangard)

       UFO's are often  CHANGING  COLOR  when  CHANGING   SPEED.    In  the
       superconducting ring currents the light is emitted by electrons that
       exhibit coherent wave properties OVER MACROSCOPIC DIMENSIONS.

       And a magnetic  field  is  capable  of varying the energy of quantum
       levels and hence the FREQUENCY OF  THE  LIGHT (different colors), as
       well as reducing drastically the THRESHOLD for the  ONSET  of  laser
       action.

       Many other strange   phenomena  accompany  the  UFO's.   The  strong
       hydromagnetism gives MAGNETO-OPTIC  REFLECTION  AND  ABSORPTION,  so
       that the ring currents CAN LOOK SOLID AND METALLIC.

       Also MAGNETO-ACOUSTIC  effects  are common.  In the super-conducting
       ring currents the  electrons  are in a coherent state of motion thus
       producing coherent electro-magnetic  waves  as  well as hydrodynamic
       shock waves which  are  capable  of giving RISE TO  COMPRESSION  AND
       RAREFACTION OF PARTICLES.

       The free electrons  in  a  current  will  THUS CHANGE THEIR DENSITY.
       Now, the behavior of electrons in a metal follows the rules of Fermi
       statistics, according to which the  energy  of  electrons  is ALWAYS
       related to their DENSITY.

       Thus when the density of the electrons in a metal is  disturbed, the
       DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR ENERGIES IS ALSO DISTURBED.

       ELECTRIC CURRENTS WILL  BE  STOPPED  causing  BLACK-OUT  of electric
       powered machines and instruments.

       To re-establish the EQUILIBRIUM DISTRIBUTION@ a  CERTAIN  RELAXATION
       TIME IS REQUIRED.


                                      Page 4





       Then the electric powered devices will REASSUME THEIR FUNCTION AS IF
       NOTHING HAD HAPPENED.  Such black-outs are some of the most reported
       effects during close  approach  of  UFO's.  (this is termed ELECTRON
       QUENCHING...Vangard)

       Two theories have been put forward  in order to explain the enormous
       amounts of energies released by hydrodynamic plasma.

       The first one says that there are hidden or uncounted EXTRA POSITIVE
       AND NEGATIVE CHARGES and hidden uncounted MAGNETIC  MOVEMENT  IN THE
       PLASMA.

       The second theory  says  that  the  energies  are  released when the
       hydromagnetic whirls of plasma assume  the SAME GEOMETRIC DIMENSIONS
       AS THE ELECTROHYDRODYNAMIC  THREADS  appropriate for  an  ELEMENTARY
       PARTICLE.  (thus providing  a  "resonant  tap"  into  the elementary
       particle...Vangard)

       The Mach principle taken into consideration, the self energy of any
       elementary particle must be described  within  the  framework of the
       universe as a whole.

       The universe is considered as a transient stage in which a transient
       LATENT UNIVERSAL POTENTIAL  (read ZERO POINT ENERGY  or  AETHER  ---
       Vangard) is TRANSFORMED  into  QUANTIZED  ACTIVE  LOCAL  ENERGIES by
       processes inside elementary particles.

       Now when we  know  that  the  energies   are   released   during   a
       superconducting state of plasma, the first theory can  be  ruled out
       DEFINITELY.

       The second theory is STILL VALID, (thank you Moray King!!).

       The superconducting state   of   electrohydromagnetic   threads   in
       particles and of coherent whirls of  elementary particles present us
       only with the information on how INFINITE AMOUNTS OF ENERGIES CAN BE
       RELEASED, but it does not provide us with any information on WHY and
       FROM WHERE the energies are coming.

       Any hypothesis saying that the superconductivity IN ITSELF possesses
       SELF-ENERGY INFINITES must be considered as IRREVELANT.

       The theory on   a   TRANSIENT   LATENT   UNIVERSAL   POTENTIAL   has
       considerable conceptual merit  in  as  much  as  it ALSO conforms to
       cosmological concepts and to universal constants.
