                                  Living Systems

                from the works of Lawrence Veale, Dr. Oscar Brunler
                            and personal communications
                            written by Jerry W. Decker

       Several years ago,   while   cruising  a  half-price  bookstore,  we
       stumbled on an  interesting  little   book   from  England  entitled
       "Divining the Primary  Sense",  by  Herbert  Weaver,   published  by
       Routledge & Kegan Paul, London, Henley and Boston in 1978.

       It details the  findings  of Lawrence Veale with his own design of a
       dowsing rod which he called the REVEALER.   The book goes into great
       detail about what Mr. Veale terms "paramagnetic suppressors."  These
       suppressors control the   chemical   interchange  phenomenon   which
       emanate between resonantly   linked  substances.   They  can  be  so
       arranged as to  either  suppress  or  enhance  radiations  by  using
       specifically geometered patterns of homogenous substances.

       This chemical interchange    phenomenon,    Veale    calls    HOMING
       CONDUCTANCE, since it  homes  onto  the  source of the radiation and
       conducts most efficiently when at resonance.

       George de la Warr, Dr. Ruth Drown  and  T.  Galen  Hieronymous found
       that radiative emissions of persons and chemical deposits are linked
       with their photographs.  Silver halides used in capturing the image,
       trap nuclear emissions which can then be used to trace  and  measure
       the nuclear bombardments.

       It appears that the electric charge of the particle is what actually
       allows this tracking   phenomenon.   Weaver  found  that  the  links
       between an organism and its blood, feather, hair, egg-shells, nails,
       bones (even after  death),  sputum,  perspiration,  excrement,  etc.
       could be intermittently detected with the REVEALER.

       It was also found that the subject is linked with its voice, or even
       heavy breathing, on  a  tape-recording.   This signal  survives  re-
       transmission over television,  radio  or the telephone and continues
       to maintain a  link with the owner  of  the  signal.   (Witness  the
       belief by many "primitive" tribes that a photograph  will  take away
       the soul of the subject of the picture.)

       In the 17th  century,  Sir Kenelm Digby produced a compound known as
       "Digby's Sympathetic Powder."  This  powder was claimed to be a cure
       for wounds.  The operation involved the application of the powder in
       the form of a curative salve TO THE BLOODSTAINS ON  THE  BANDAGE AND
       NOT TO THE WOUND ITSELF!  The results were reported to be both rapid
       and soothing, and  aroused  the interest of King James and his Royal
       Physician.

       In a modern  duplication  of the "Digby  Effect",  experiments  were
       undertaken by Veale using cuts on fingers, ankles  and  toes.   Very
       rapid healing of  even  very deep cuts were completely free from pus
       buildup which often accompanies the  healing of a cut which has been
       DIRECTLY TREATED by medicaments.

       Immediately after a cut, a clear fluid precedes the  issue of blood,
       known as the  "first  issue".   This  free  flow of blood as well as
       other cellular fluids (consisting  of  chemicals,  RNA and DNA) from
       the damaged cells inside the wound was staunched with a bandage.

       Within a few  minutes  the  bandage was taken off and  placed  in  a
       solution of TCP  and  water  (TCP  happened  to be the antiseptic at
       hand.)  The bandage was then laid  ON  A REVERSED SAUCER (to prevent
       suppression of the cellular radiation by the circular  form if in an
       upright position).

       A plaster was  then  placed  over  the  wound,  WHICH  HAD  NOT BEEN
       PHYSICALLY TOUCHED WITH ANY ANTISEPTIC,  in  order  to  keep out the
       grit.

       On one occasion  where a bad chisel cut had been suffered  the  thus
       treated patient reported an initial sharp stinging of the wound just
       after the removed  bandage had been treated.  In this case an amount
       of TCP had  been  applied to the  blood  on  the  bandage,  yet  not
       directly to the  wound.   The  next  day, this bad cut  had  lightly
       healed over, with no suppuration (pus) of any kind.

       A half and  half solution of TCP and water was applied to the cotton
       wool after the  boy  had  gone to  his  room.   AT  THE  MOMENT  THE
       ANTISEPTIC WAS APPLIED to the cotton wool, the boy  called  out that
       HIS TOE WAS STINGING.

       Is it possible  the "Digby Effect" is effective because of some type
       of HOMING CONDUCTANCE which penetrates  the  skin  and  reaches  the
       inner, damaged tissue  or  cells whence the blood  first  came?   As
       opposed to a surface treatment of the wouund using antiseptics which


                                      Page 2





       DO NOT REACH  THOSE  INNER  TISSUES owing to the pinch effect of the
       elastic skin and its congealed surface.

       Pain is sensed  ONLY  when the cellular  integrity  is  breached  by
       slicing into the  cell  wall  or  by  bruising which  causes  stress
       patterns in the cellular membrane with a partial collapse due to the
       squeezed out fluid in the localized area.

       Psychic healers claim  to  be  able  to  pass  their  hands directly
       through the skin without pain or  discomfort  on  the  part  of  the
       patient.

       If some form  of  high vibration could be practically  exerted,  the
       skin and tissues  of  the  body  could  be  entered  and manipulated
       without pain or  damage.   Cutting  and  brusing  results  in  great
       stress, shock, cellular  death and even somatic mutations  resulting
       in cancer.

       Reports indicate that  the  psychic  healer treats the skin as if it
       were a zipper, opening and closing it with hand manipulations.

       There are many stories involving  the  phenomenon  of "phantom limb"
       pain or itching which occurs in the location of a recent amputation.
       To all appearances,  there  is  NO  PHYSICAL STRUCTURE  which  could
       transmit pain or itching into the severed nerve endings.

       A friend tells  us  of  an  American  Indian method of torture which
       involved the amputation of an arm  or  a  leg.   The  arm or leg was
       placed on an ant bed while the living victim was left in a cell.

       As the ants proceeded to dismember the still living limb, the person
       would feel the  "phantom  limb"  and  slowly  go  insane  under  the
       unsatisfiable tearing and itching sensations.

       In Kirlian photography,  the "phantom leaf" effect is well known.  A
       picture is taken  of  a leaf which  clearly  shows  a  coherent  and
       structured radiational pattern emitting from the edges of the leaf.

       However, when a  section of the leaf is torn or cut  from  the  main
       body and another  Kirlian  photo  is taken, a ghost image is clearly
       seen showing the veins and general leaf structure where the leaf had
       originally been.

       This is the energy field of the  leaf  which  maintains  contact  by
       complex two-way frequency communication with the  physical  mass  no
       longer present.  Matter  is  formed  and  maintained by these energy
       patterns.

       Resonant coupling between  the physical  form  and  the  engendering
       energy pattern allows  this  communication until the  physical  mass
       degrades or "detunes" by decomposition or transmutation.

       A further interesting  note  in  regard  to this "phantom limb" pain
       comes from the 7 Laws of Noah (also on KeelyNet under NOAHLAW).

       When Noah and the 7 other members  of  his  group  left  the  Ark, a
       covenant was made between GOD and all the surviving  race of Man, in
       effect "as long as the rainbow shall form in the heavens".

       Man is forbidden from...

         V.  EATING THE LIMB OF A LIVING CREATURE

               1.  eating  a  limb  severed FROM A LIVING ANIMAL, beast, or
                   fowl

               2.  eating the flesh of any  animal which was torn by a wild
                   beast ... which, in part, prohibits the  eating  of such
                   flesh as was torn off an animal WHILE IT WAS STILL ALIVE

       We think it   quite  amazing  that  cellular  communication  between
       separated living body parts appears  to  happen, and that a Biblical
       tradition would enjoin  Mankind to refrain from such  activities  as
       the above.

       Man apparently was  not  at a level of understanding at that time to
       be capable of absorbing the REAL REASON for such a commandment.

       Depending on the sensitivity of the animal, it could be a horrendous
       torture.  David Fasold (discoverer  of  the  Ark of Noah) and Vendyl
       Jones tell us that some ancient peoples actually removed parts of an
       animal as they  needed  it, keeping the animal alive  until  another
       part was required.

       Remember that these   people   had  no  means  of  refrigeration  or
       preserving meats.  This was simply  the easiest means of keeping the
       meat available, as grotesque and primitive as it was.

       As further confirmation of Veale's discovery,we have  stumbled  onto
       something which gives  a semblance of proof of such cellular rapport
       over distance.

       Ron Barker taped  a  TV  special   by   the   producers  of  "That's
       Incredible."  This particular special was called "Super  Sunday" and
       had a fascinating segment involving the work of Cleve Backster.

       Mr.  Backster has  moved  from  using  lie  detectors  which  detect
       signals in the millivolt (thousandths)  range  to EEG's which detect
       microvolts (millionths) for his increasingly sensitive experiments.

       In this segment,  a  female  volunteer was given a  saline  solution
       which she used to rinse out her mouth.  The fluid was centrifuged to
       remove the still  living white cells which were then connected to an
       EEG machine.  The cells were then  placed  under a Faraday cage in a
       separate room in   order   to  shield  the  cells  from   electrical
       interference.

       The woman was  taken  to  another room where she was asked questions
       especially designed to provoke a reaction  which would indicate high
       anxiety or stress.  The video screen was split to allow  the viewers
       to see the  EEG  trace  simultaneously  with the woman while she was
       being questioned.

       When disturbing questions were asked,  the  white cell sample in the
       other room showed  a definite response through the  EEG  trace  even
       though not physically connected to the woman.



                                      Page 4





       As a further  indication  of  the  ability of the signal to traverse
       distances, the woman was taken to a rather seedy section of town and
       asked to walk through a lighted area.   As  she  walked, a videotape
       was recording her  movements  while  another was recording  the  EEG
       responses of her tissues back at the lab.

       A stranger accosted  the  woman  for  some  money,  resulting  in an
       extremely high anxiety response which  was INSTANTANEOUSLY picked up
       by the EEG  connected  to  her  white  cell sample  miles  away  and
       shielded inside the Faraday cage.

       Predictions for using  this  phenomenon include monitoring the vital
       signs or stress levels of astronauts  while  they are in deep space.
       This is to be done by using cultured samples of their living tissues
       here on the  planet.  This obviously opens many possibilities,  some
       very disturbing.

       Hospitals are as  a  rule  EXTREMELY  CLEAN  PLACES.  However, post-
       operational infections frequently    occur   DESPITE   THE   STERILE
       CONDITIONS of the operating room and the wound dressings.  (referred
       to as NOCOSOMIAL or "hospital contracted" infections)

       New medical evidence  assigns  the  cause  of  this to  "internally"
       released microbial infections.      COULD    THESE    POST-OPERATIVE
       INFECTIONS ALSO BE A RESULT OF THE HOMING CONDUCTANCE PHENOMENON?

       The surgically removed  section   of  the  body  (parts  or  fluids)
       automatically continues to HOME IN ON THE CONTIGUOUS,  DAMAGED CELLS
       IN THE BODY   area   from   whence  it  came,  unless  radiationally
       suppressed with the use of a paramagnetic suppressor.

       SHOULD THE REMOVED TISSUE OR FLUID  COME  INTO CONTACT WITH INFECTED
       MATTER, AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO ITS RADIATIONAL NEUTRALIZATION
       (where neutralization is understood to consist of putrefaction  or a
       half-life acceleration which  will decompose the tissue to elemental
       levels), THE INFECTION  COULD  BE   CONDUCTED   INTO  THE  PATIENT'S
       SURGICALLY WOUNDED CELLS VIA THE HOMING CONDUCTANCE RAY-LINK!

       In other words,  IF  THE FIELD AMPLITUDE OF THE INFECTED  MATTER  IS
       SUFFICIENT TO OVERCOME  THE  FIELD ENERGY FROM THE REMOVED TISSUE OR
       FLUID which has been absorbed in a DISCARDED BANDAGE, IT IS POSSIBLE
       THAT INFECTION MIGHT BE "BROADCAST" AND RECEIVED BY THE WEAKENED BUT
       RECOVERING BODY.

       This again opens many new avenues of investigation.  To think that a
       sample of saliva, blood or body waste  (all  of which contain living
       cells from your  body  - to establish a telephone link  directly  to
       your bodily energy  matrix),  could  come into contact with infected
       matter which could LITERALLY INFECT  YOU  WITHOUT  YOUR KNOWLEDGE OR
       PHYSICAL CONTACT!!

       Startling as this stuff is, we felt it worthy of inclusion  in  this
       issue of the  PLENUM  (and  now  on  the  KeelyNet).   If  you  have
       information relating to this phenomenon,  we  would  appreciate your
       sharing with us, so we can in turn share with others.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------
        The following article is also from the Nov-Dec issue of the PLENUM.
              It is almost most interesting and related to the above.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

                       Doctors and their Impact on Mortality

       According to at  least three independent surveys,  the human death
       rate invariably DECREASES  whenever  doctors go on strike.  In 1976,
       for example, doctors in Los Angeles  went  on  strike to protest the
       skyrocketing cost of malpractice insurance.

       An 18% DROP IN THE DEATH RATE was recorded during  the strike.  In
       that same year,  doctors  in Bogota, Colombia, refused to handle all
       but the most urgent cases; THE RATE OF DEATH PLUMMETED TO 35%.

       When Israeli doctors began limiting  their  patient contact in 1973,
       50% FEWER DEATHS OCCURRED.

       Most authorities attribute the cause of these deaths  to UNNECESSARY
       SURGERY!  Perhaps of equal importance is what physicians refer to as
       NOCOSOMIAL or "HOSPITAL CONTRACTED" disease.

       While being treated   for  one  disease,  OVER  1  MILLION patients
       annually in the United States CONTRACT  A  SECOND  DISEASE CAUSED BY
       THE HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT ITSELF; of these, 15,000   S U C C U M B
       TO THE HOSPITAL-BORNE AILMENT.

       Physician's negligence, meanwhile,  KILLS  OR  INJURES   MORE THAN
       100,000 patients a  year,  according  to  the  Public Citizen Health
       Research Group.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       What can one do to minimize the possibility of becoming one of these
       NOCOSOMIAL STATISTICS?

       If our actions were to be partially  based  on the preceding article
       and I personally found it necessary to be hospitalized, although it
       would seem to  be  a  strange  request, I would DEMAND that my wound
       dressings, bandages and removed tissues  be  placed in a sealed zip-
       lock type bag  to  prevent  physical  contact  with  other infected
       tissue.

       In addition, I  would  ask  that  these be given to me, my family or
       friends for disposal.

       The main thing is to allow putrefaction (detuning) to occur which
       would minimize the effectiveness of the cellular broadcasts between
       other tissues and your own.

       Within a 1 to 3 day period (depending on the nature  of the tissue),
       your tissues would  no  longer be YOURS due to this putrefaction and
       subsequent breakdown.

       The inverse square law shows that  the  closer one is to a radiating
       source, the higher the energy level absorbed.  Therefore, separation
       from radiating diseased tissues would seem prudent.


                                      Page 6





       Of course, proximity,  even though using separate  containers would
       still allow the  transmission  of  mitogenetic radiation which might
       pass through plastic, but I would  take  all possible precautions to
       prevent any energetic warpings of my system.

       Veale indicates that  the  use of a paramagnetic suppressor in the
       form of 4  parallel  lines  made  of  sticks or any other homogenous
       (identical substance) material for  all  4  could  also  be used to
       suppress the HOMING CONDUCTANCE RAY-LINK.

       If these 4  objects  were  placed  in the bag with the dressing or
       tissue, the ray  would  be  suppressed.   All it takes is 4 straight
       parallel lines which  could even  be  drawn  on  the  bag.  Another
       suppressor is a circle around the dressing or tissue  to contain the
       radiational outreach.

       This pattern should   be   maintained   until   the reduction and
       neutralization of the dressing/tissue by putrefaction is visible.
