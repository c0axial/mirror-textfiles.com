The following might be useful to help everyone deal with allergy problems, it
seems to only take about one afternoon of treatment that can last up to a
month in some cases.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From Science Digest - December 1982

In Brief

Inhalation of warm, moist air may help quell respiratory allergies.

A team of Israeli and French physicians recently tested a new device, called
the Rhinoderm, that delivers humidified air at 109 degrees Fahrenheit into a
patient's nostrils.

Of those allergy sufferers receiving three 30-minute treatments spaced two
hours apart, about three-quarters reported that they were FREE of symptoms a
week later; two-thirds said their relief lasted for up to a month.

The Rhinotherm was effective against allergies to pollen, molds, dust and
animal hair.  The researchers speculate that in raising the temperature of the
nasal passages, the procedure somehow rallies the patient's defenses against
the factors causing allergic attacks.  They also note that it may effectively
suppress symptoms of the common cold as well.

Vanguard Note

  The speculation as to why this treatment works on allergies is more
  logically due to flushing of the nasal passages by the hot moisturized air.

  Tissue is known to expand and become very absorptive when exposed to warm
  moisture and so, it makes more sense to claim that the polluting agents that
  accumulate on the nasal walls and up in the sinus passage could be easily
  dislodged by the hot moisture and ejected by blowing the nose.  Simply
  blowing ones nose won't easily remove lodged allergic particulates, but the
  hot, wet air would.

  As to colds, there is a machine on the market now (though I can't think of
  the name of it) which produces a hot moisture that is to be inhaled through
  the nostrils.  The idea is that the hot air would help to kill off any
  bacteria associated with the cold.

  I have also seen a device that would act as a pin to hold the nostrils
  together, thus preventing the input of any cooler air to aid the growth of
  the bacteria.  When the nostrils are held closed, the excess heat of the
  body will naturally kill off the bacteria.

  Another item I have tried for the feeling of a cold or flu (beginnings of a
  sore throat or nasal drips) is 2 HCL tablets followed by a glass of water
  and then sleep.  The tablets that I used were called BETAINE w/pepsin and
  sold as an assist to digestion.  However, thanks to the experimentation of
  Bob Aldrich and some of his folks out in LA based on the paper HCL.ASC, I
  haven't had flu now in almost two years.  When I feel the beginning of the
  sore throat or drips, I just take 2 tablets, the water and sleep, waking up
  with NO SYMPTOMS.  The bottomline is whatever WORKS FOR YOU.

  One more point regarding allergies, vitamin B-12 has been found to be very
  effective in helping to reduce the allergic response.  The recommended dose
  was 2000mg (milligrams) per day.  I must report that for 3 days running I
  had the most miserable of allergy symptoms, itching eyes and clogged
  nostrils, to the point that I was taking Triaminic and 4Way Nasal Spray just
  to be able to breathe comfortably.

  After finding out about the B-12, I took 2000mg the night before and awoke
  the 4th day with clear nostrils.  HOWEVER, I found I had to do 4000mg per
  day to keep them as clear as possible.  One other good point about B-12, is
  it's supposed to give you extra energy, it seemed to do so for me, but I am
  uncertain that the B-12 was the cause because of the fore-knowledgeable
  about what it was SUPPOSED to do.  Good luck with minimizing your allergy
  problems........................................................>>>  Jerry
