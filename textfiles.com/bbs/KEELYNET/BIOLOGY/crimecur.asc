                                 How to Cure Crime
                               written for KeelyNet
                                by Jerry W. Decker

       No doubt many of us are concerned with the steady increase of crimes
       that lead to  killings  or  the  development  of a  mentality  which
       disregards human life as being worth preserving.

       The Federal government  (with Clinton behind it) is proposing adding
       an additional 100,000 police officers  to  the  nation's  cities.  A
       radio talk show recently brought up the following facts.   It  costs
       the state from  $23,000  to  $30,000  per  person per year to keep a
       convicted criminal incarcerated.

       If each of these 100,000 NEW police  officers make just one case per
       month which results  in  a criminal conviction requiring  jail  time
       that comes to an ADDITIONAL $176,000,000 per year (least case) added
       to our taxes  to support this effort.  This does not include all the
       criminals CURRENTLY taking up jail space.

       How many times over the past few  years  have  you  heard  of  over-
       crowding in the jails?  Or that there are new facilities being built
       to support the ever-growing incarcerated criminal population.

       There is little  question that something must be  done  to  stop  or
       greatly reduce crime and its side effects.  Dr. Ruwalt suggests that
       by taking a  non-aggressor  role,  we could tremendously improve the
       situation.  This includes incarcerating  ONLY  violent  criminals or
       those who have committed theft or crimes which harm  others.   Drugs
       are an individual  choice,  harming  no one but the person who takes
       them and so is a non-aggressive crime.

       So many of the "criminals" now taking  up  jail  space  did not harm
       another person yet we are supporting them to the tune of $23,000 per
       year minimum.  It's OK to take medically prescribed  drugs  or drink
       alcohol as most  of  the resulting damage done is only to the person
       actually imbibing the substance.  So substance abuse is a victimless
       crime and is thus non-aggressive.   As long as it remains illegal to
       partake, then distribution sets up the illegal situations that

                                      Page 1





       foster criminal behavior  and  we just dig deeper holes, rather than
       jumping out and starting over.

       As long as "Our" government continues  to  spread  its  control into
       almost every aspect  of  our  lives, we will continue  to  not  take
       responsibility for our  OWN  actions,  thus  setting up the patterns
       that give such  control of our lives  to  some  kind  of  regulatory
       agency.  Sooner or later, such control will become  so all pervasive
       that it will  result  in  a backlash in the form of revolution.  But
       for now, we should do whatever we  LEGALLY can to make things better
       for ourselves and our countrymen.

       Because of this   ever  growing  criminal  population   and   random
       sociopathic behavior, I  decided  to document and distribute through
       KeelyNet and other  BBSs some observations  that  have  come  to  my
       attention over the years.

       We who study  alternative  science take a wide ranging  approach  to
       information.  This includes  formal  science  in  all its aspects as
       well as metaphysical and private  investigations  by  ourselves  and
       others willing to  share their findings.  These "less  than  formal"
       investigations are usually  shrugged  off  as  being  without  merit
       because you cannot always duplicate or verify what is being claimed.

       However, once you have established  in  your  own mind a set of what
       makes sense, that is the ultimate determinant as  to  what  you will
       allow as "possible".   Of  course,  all growing things change, so if
       one's concepts are  proven  as false  to  the  satisfaction  of  the
       person, the "worldview" also changes to fit the newest parameters.

       I preface the following with that last paragraph so  you  won't just
       laugh this off as a line of BS (as we say in Texas), but rather read
       it through, then  think  about  it.   There are numerous experiments
       verifying the action of monopolar  magnetic  fields and recently the
       CAT scan images have shown increased blood flow in  areas  which are
       being "used" by our conscious minds.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       One of the most interesting books I have ever read was one called "A
       Dweller on Two Planets", written in the late 19th century by a young
       man who "channelled"   the  information.   It  predicts  submarines,
       radio, TV, flying  machines,  transmutation  and  a  host  of  other
       developments which we  have  YET to achieve.  The  book  also  gives
       hints as to  the forces necessary to devise these machines.  You can
       purchase it from  Health  Research,   PO  BOX  70,  Mokelumne  Hill,
       California, 95245 for about $15.00.  You won't be disappointed.

       This is an  almost  forgotten  book  that  will  really   peak  your
       interest.  It would  make  a  movie that would blow everyone away if
       done at a quality level as demonstrated  by  the  likes  of Lucas or
       Spielberg.  Perhaps they will get a copy of this  and  look  at  the
       book.  It would  be great to see movies that teach moral and science
       principles through anecdotal experiences.

       The following is excerpted from Chapter  IX,  called  Curing  Crime,
       pages 96 through 101.  I have reduced it to the details  so you will
       more easily grasp the correlations that will follow.

       Zailm is the  character  who  we follow throughout the book.  In his
       youth, he stumbled on a very rich gold deposit which led to his

                                      Page 2





       association with two  investors.   These  fellows developed the mine
       and cheated not only Zailm but also  the  government  out  of  their
       share from the yield of the mine.  Once they were caught,  tried and
       convicted, they were  offered  a  chance  to  be  treated  for their
       criminal tendencies which would allow  them  to  remain  free.  They
       both agreed.  and  what  follows  is  the  chapter   describing  the
       "treatment".

       You should bear  in mind that the body is much like a magnet in that
       there is a FIELD which controls the formation of tissue.  This field
       is generally known as the "morphogenetic field" of Rupert Sheldrake,
       or my personal hero, Dr. Harold S.  Burr  with  his major researches
       into what he calls the "electro-dynamic field".

       Many people with whom I share information are of  the  opinion  that
       the AURA is  a  visible  representation  of these fields and that by
       energetically manipulating this "aura", you can affect the formation
       of tissue to heal.

       Please bear in mind that tissue,  once  formed  has  a longer "life"
       than the field which formed it.  Do you not wonder  why  a cancerous
       tumor can be surgically removed from the body, yet will grow back if
       not further treated?   It  is  because  the  AURA  is  projecting  a
       distorted field that will FORM the tissue in a cancerous pattern.

       So, for a  complete resolution of  the  problem,  depending  on  its
       severity of course, you must change the aura as well as remove or
       "affect" the tissue,  through  magnetic  or  other energetic  fields
       (including MIND forces such as positive sustained patterns projected
       to the diseased area).

                                    CHAPTER IX
                                   CURING CRIME

       ...Arriving at the  Court  of the Tribunes, I saw my mining partners
       there in custody, along with the incriminated purchaser of the gold.

       There could be but one verdict concerning  the  malefactors, "Guilty
       as charged."  This  opinion  was reached very quickly,  and  by  the
       culprits admitted to  be  a  just one.  Immediately, an officer took
       the prisoners into another part of  the  building, where was a well-
       lighted apartment, fitted  with  various  portable   and  stationary
       instruments.  He was accompanied by all persons present.

       A chair with  a  head-clasp  rest,  and with other rests, clasps and
       straps for the limbs and body of the  occupant,  stood in the center
       of the room.   A  guardsman seated and firmly strapped  one  of  the
       prisoners in the  chair.   This  preliminary  attended  to, a Xioqua
       (scientist teaching at a University) approached bearing in his hands
       a small instrument of which, from its general appearance, I knew the
       nature to be magnetic.

       He placed the two poles of this in  the  hands of the condemned man,
       and after a  brief manipulation a slight, purring  sound  was  heard
       from the instrument.  Immediately the prisoner's eyes closed and his
       every appearance indicated   profound   stupor;   he   was  in  fact
       magnetically anesthetized.

                                      Page 3





       Then the operator   carefully   felt   all  over  the  head  of  the
       unconscious man, and  this  examination   concluded,   ordered   the
       attendant to shave  the entire cranium.  When this  order  had  been
       obeyed, he made  a  blue  mark  upon the shaven surface in front and
       above the ears.

       Feeling further, he made the numeral  2  above  and a little back of
       each ear.  These  operatons  done,  he  gave  his attention  to  the
       spectators, but, on  being spoken to by the Rai Gwauxln (the emperor
       or ruler of the country), he paused  long  enough  from  making  his
       proposed address to  the  audience  to call me from  where  I  stood
       outside the railing.  The he spoke:

       "In the prisoner   I   find  that  the  predominant,  most  positive
       faculties are those which I have  marked  one  and  two;  these are,
       number one, a   grasping  desire  to  acquire  property,   and   his
       disposition is to  do  all  things secretly, as may be seen from the
       exceeding prominence of the organs of secretiveness.

       While the skull does not extend upwards very high, but at number two
       is very wide between the ears, I  should  infer  that here we have a
       very acquisitive individual,    lacking    conscientiousness     and
       spirituality, and therefore the moral nature, almost wholly.

       As he has also a very destructive temperament, we have withal a very
       dangerous character, one  which  I  marvel has so managed as not ere
       this to have exposed himself to this office for correction.  Why any
       one should hesitate,  even  voluntarily,   to   undergo   corrective
       treatment causes me much wonder.

       It is something, I suppose, explicable on the theory that one on the
       low moral plane of this poor fellow is unable to see  the  advantage
       of being on  any  higher  plane,  but  is  able to see the immediate
       advantages due to pursuit of nefarious methods.

       He is, in short, a man who would not  hesitate  at the commission of
       murder, could he  see  any  immediate  gain  in it,  and  be  wholly
       oblivious of after  consequences.   Is  this true, Zo Rai (a term of
       respect)?"

       "It is," replied the emperor.  (The  emperor  in  this instance is a
       highly evolved individual,  expert  in  most  fields  and  thus  his
       guidance is much appreciated and valued.)

       "My diagnosis of  the  case,"  continued  the  Xioqa,  "having  been
       confirmed by so high an authority, I will now apply the cure."

       He summoned an attendant, who wheeled out another magnetic apparatus
       contained in a  heavy  metal  case.    Having   placed   this  in  a
       satisfactory condition of  activity,  the  Xioqa  next  applied  its
       positive pole to that place on the head of the patient marked by the
       figure one, and the other pole he placed at the back of the neck.

       He then took  out his timepiece and laid it on the metal case of the
       instrument, near a dial the pointer  of  which he adjusted.  All was
       then still, except the low-toned conversation in  various  parts  of
       the room, during the ensuing half hour.

       At the end of this time the Xioqa arose from the seat and changed

                                      Page 4





       the positive pole to the other side of the head, where the duplicate
       figure was marked.   Then  again a half-hour's quiet, broken only by
       the exit of some of the spectators and the entrance of others.

       When the half hour had again elapsed,  the operator changed the pole
       to the place marked "two." This time only half an hour  was given to
       both sides of  the  head.  I had been told by the emperor to remain.
       He had only  stayed  a  few  moments  after  the  beginning  of  the
       operation which was not new to him.

       At the end of the work on the first man he was taken  from under the
       influence of the magnetic anesthetizer by merely reversing the poles
       of the instrument  at a second application.  The Xioqa lectured upon
       the theme afforded by the operation  while  the  first  patient  was
       being removed.  To the considerable audience that had, by this time,
       assembled, he said:

       "You have seen the treatment of those mental qualities  which tended
       through their predominance  to  warp his moral nature, something but
       partially developed.  The process  has been partially to atrophy the
       vascular channels supplying  that  portion of the  brain  where  are
       located the organs of greed and of destruction.

       But mark well this point, after all is said, the soul is superior to
       the physical brain, and it is in the soul, the nature of the man, in
       which these criminal  tendencies inhere - the brain and other organs
       being the seat of psychic expression  -  the  business office, so to
       speak.

       Hence, merely to have mechanically hypnotized this subject would not
       accomplish our purpose.   Hypnotizing  is  an  indrawing,   and  the
       cerebral blood-vessels contract   and  become  partially  bloodless;
       indeed, they may become fatally empty;  this are is a very dangerous
       one.

       But the opposite  effect  is produced in aphaism (Poseid  equivalent
       for the modern  word  "mesmerism").  The brain is filled with blood,
       and the reversion  of  the  instrument  cessated  the  hypnotic  and
       initiated the aphaic process.  It is at this moment that the mind of
       the operator may  assume  control  of the mind of the  subject,  and
       suggest to the erring soul a permanent cessation of the error.

       This man has been so treated, doubly treated, since not only has the
       blood supply been PARTIALLY CUT OFF which went to those organs where
       was the seat  of his weakness, but with my will I have impressed ihs
       soul to cease its sin, and I have supplied it with a work to execute
       which will have a counter action.

       He may be slightly ill for a few  days,  but  his  tendencies to sin
       will be gone.  It requires a superior mind, which has  gone wrong in
       several directions, to  make  a  successful evil-doer, and where the
       lower nature, chiefly  a perverted  sex-nature  predominates,  there
       will be found the criminal.

       Atla (their term  for their country, Poseid being  their  continent)
       has no debauchees,  for if a person show such disposition, the State
       takes the wayward one in hand and  operates  upon the proper organs.
       But I need not dilate upon these subjects any further."

       The first man having been taken away to receive careful nursing, the
       next of my  whilom partners was placed in the chair.  Examination of
       the cerebral development revealed that he was more weak than wicked;
       an habitual prevaricator, and of  libertine  tendencies;  one  whose
       skull was mostly  behind and above the ears.  I need  not  pause  to
       describe his treatment;  it  was on the lines of the other; mesmeric
       suggestion was the chief cure.

       End of Chapter
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       This amazing tale offers a series of techniques that could provide a
       solution to many  of  our societal  problems.   Yes,  I  sense  your
       thoughts of what a government or private organization  could do with
       such technology, yet,  do we ignore it because of paranoia (though I
       too have reservations about its misuse).

       The beneficial possibilities of these  combined methods are so great
       that we must  do  the  next  best  thing,  and  that  is  to  freely
       distribute the information  so  that  all  may  know of it.  Such an
       attitude allows people  to  be  aware  of  suspicious  actions  that
       indicate use of  mind control techniques.  The more  who  know,  the
       more difficult for it to be abused by a select few with superior and
       hidden knowledge.  We  here  at KeelyNet practice that approach with
       many subjects and promote such attitudes wherever possible.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Modern Correlations

       Recent studies with thermography  and  CAT  scans  have  shown  that
       certain areas of  the brain show heavy blood flow  with  a  rise  in
       local temperature when that area of the brain is being "exercised".

       The magnetic research  and  discoveries of Walter Rawls and the late
       Albert Roy Davis into the effects  of  North and South Pole energies
       is still not  widely  known.   North pole energies  spin  in  a  CCW
       direction and cause matter to CONTRACT.  South pole energies spin in
       a CW direction and cause matter to EXPAND.

       Experiments have shown  that  fluids  attract to a North pole magnet
       and are dispersed by a South pole  magnet.   This is simply a bar or
       cylinder magnet with  the  end being exposed to the  targeted  area.
       There must be the greatest purity of monopole energy to get the best
       effect, that is,  the further the North pole is from the South pole,
       the better.

       Magnets used in their experiments  were  on the order of 3000 Gauss.
       See "DAVRAW.ASC" on KeelyNet for further details and  "CONTACT1.ASC"
       for Walter Rawls  address should you decide to write him.  They have
       many excellent books  detailing their  findings  which  we  here  at
       KeelyNet support fully.  As usual, they will not be recognized until
       after their death (Davis is deceased, but I have met  with  Rawls in
       Jacksonville, Florida a few years ago).

       There is one  other  aspect that I hesitate to bring up, but it does
       indicate something that is a correlative to this concept of magnetic
       adjustment of tendencies.  It is called "Phrenology" and is based on
       the presence of bumps on the head.   Depending  on  their  location,
       these bumps can be interpreted and provide a "map" of the tendencies
       and abilities of a person.


                                      Page 6





       Since blood flow in a given area determines the amount of energy and
       nutrient available in  that area, it also determines the size of the
       organ so stimulated with such excess  blood  flow  (atrophied tissue
       results from lack of use, including mind stimulation).

       Thus, as per  the CAT scan and thermographs, these  bumps  could  be
       seen to be  tissue  projections.   This  is due to higher blood flow
       activity when that area or pattern  of behavior (as directed TO that
       physical location) are so stimulated as to increase  the  growth  of
       tissue in that area.

       So, here is the scenario as to how such a method would work:

       To determine the nature of the subject's tendencies

          The CAT  scan  method  only  shows  activity  WHEN the subject is
          consciously directing  thoughts   TO  or  concentrating  ON  that
          particular tendency (and thus area of the brain)  OR  is  in  the
          throws of  a physical reaction as directed by that "excited" area
          of the brain.

          Therefore, it is not reliable  because  the  subject  can  easily
          shift his  thoughts to other subjects, thus suppressing  activity
          in the region and masking the problem.  This could be overcome by
          a remote telemetering device constantly attached to the person so
          that a  recording  could  be made of his most prevalent thoughts,
          especially when exposed to situations  that  excite  thoughts  in
          that area.

          The other method of "Phrenology" involves the "reading"  of these
          bumps on the head.  They could be used to develop a 3 dimensional
          map showing such projections and there physical location.  Such a
          map would be compared to a database to determine which tendencies
          were detected.

       The Magnetic treatment

          Once the  tendencies and their physical locations (based on heavy
          blood flow and resultant increased temperatures) were determined,
          the North pole magnet energy can  be applied to cause the tissues
          to contract,  thus reducing the ABILITY of the  fluid  to  easily
          flow within  that  area  of  the  brain.   Thus,  you  reduce the
          electrical activity and the ability  to  "think"  about  a  given
          pattern of action due to the reduction of flow in that area.

          The amount of time to which the area is exposed to the North pole
          energies will determine the degree of contraction  of  the tissue
          for that area and thus the effectiveness of the treatment.

       Convicted criminals could  be offered this treatment, carried out by
       certified practitioners, with  the   understanding   they  would  be
       released under a probationary period, after the treatment  had  been
       successfully applied.

       The conditions would  include  a  thorough  analysis of the detected
       tendencies, with a full explanation to the subject of what was to be
       done and why.  The recommended treatment would be agreed upon by the
       subject and a formal contract and release signed for legal reasons.

       One of the  interesting  points  to  note  is  the  need  for a dual
       treatment.  It is one thing to diminish  blood  flow  in a specified
       area of the   brain,  with  the  intent  being  to  reduce   actions
       coincident with criminal   or  sociopathic  behavior,  it  is  quite
       another to alter the mind field  that  the  subject  directs  to the
       physical area TO  CAUSE such stimulation and tissue  growth  through
       ongoing mental excitation.

       This is where  the  AURA  and/or  the  mesmeric/hypnotic  suggestion
       techniques must be used.  You will  note in the quotes from the book
       that the practitioner  deemed  it  necessary  to  give  the  subject
       SOMETHING ELSE to keep them occupied and thus prevent a relapse into
       the old tendencies?  I thought that very intriguing, a form of "mis-
       direction" much like a magician uses, watch this hand and ignore the
       one that is doing the mischief.

       Magnetic anesthesia as  described in the paper seems to involve some
       kind of hypnotic sleep, not so much for pain, but for suppression of
       active thought to prevent a cancellation  of  the localized magnetic
       treatment from the  subjects  active  thoughts.    A   quenching  of
       electrical activity as it were.

       Despite the suppression of thought DURING the treatment, it was also
       necessary to convince  the  subject of the errors of his ways and BY
       THAT CONVINCING induce him to change on his own.

       So, you get a dual action, lack of  attraction to thinking about the
       ingrained patterning of the tissue as well as the  lack  of  further
       stimulation by the  desire  of the subject.  And it is made all that
       much easier when the subject has  something  to  take  its place and
       thus diminish the "morbid" thoughts in that direction.   What is the
       old quote?  "Idle  hands  (minds)  do  the Devils work" or something
       like that.

       No doubt you have seen how many people  don't  busy  themselves with
       useful activities and/or studies and thus wind up in  activities  or
       pursuits that hurt  themselves or others through their actions.  How
       many times have you heard people  say  how  bored  they are, or that
       there is nothing  to  do?   So,  the  Xioqa  just gave  the  subject
       something useful and fulfilling to do.

       This obviously has  possibilities FAR BEYOND simply reconditioning a
       criminal mind, but I won't go into those possibilities at this time.
       Perhaps this paper will get into the  hands of someone or group with
       the funding, equipment and knowledge to investigate it.

       I would dearly  love to be involved in such a project  (as  well  as
       dozens of others  which  we here at KeelyNet have researched to some
       degree), but people with capital just  don't  get it, so we continue
       collecting and sharing information, in hopes someday  we  will get a
       benefactor or group  of folks with sufficient foresight to see where
       much of this could lead.  In the  meantime,  papers  such  as  this,
       freely distributed so that a majority of people can  learn  of these
       things, serve to at least keep the information alive and available.

       I frequently wonder   why  people  who  come  into  money,  such  as
       inheritances, lottery winners, etc. don't even consider contributing
       to any kind of research in the field  of  the  alternative  sciences
       that can have such far reaching implications.

       As we all  get  older, time and energy loss works  against  us  all.
       There are SO   MANY   exceptional   people  out  there  who  need  a
       knowledgeable umbrella support system  to help bring their ideas and
       experiments to usable,  marketable products.  We could  change  many
       aspects of modern  life  and  offer  opportunities for expansion and
       improvement FAR BEYOND  the  current   technologies.   The  positive
       ramifications to society as well as stimulating the  young minds now
       wandering without purpose or direction are beyond calculation.

       We have leads  for  developing  technologies  in the following areas
       (there are more, but for lack of  space  and  time,  only  these are
       listed);

          1)  local energy generation devices that tap space energy as well
              as other non-conventional force producing techniques,
              a)  no  more electrical power bills from a centralized  power
                  company,
              b)  no more gas bills for your vehicle
              c)  no more pollution from petroleum by-products
          2)  magnetic,  herbal  and  electro-magnetic  techniques  to heal
              diseased tissue and sustain a healthy system
              a)  no more surgery (except in emergency situations)
              b)  no more drugs
              c)  no more reactions from  faulty  application  of  drugs or
                  medication
          3)  devices  that  allow  the  body  to  give  a feedback  signal
              indicating whether  a given substance will help it or further
              harm it
              a)  would determine a yes/no as to benefit for the body
              b)  advanced unit would determine degree of effect
              c)  can be adapted to a portable  unit  for  use  when buying
                  foods, eating out, determining the health  of a potential
                  sex partner, etc...
          4)  a means for slowing down, halting and/or reversing aging
              a)  based  on  continual replenishment and regrowth of tissue
                  with new material
              b)  barring massive accidental  destruction,  it  allows  the
                  subject to  decide  when THEY tire of life,  rather  than
                  allowing a "natural" system degradation
              c)  subject would have all the time THEY CHOOSE to experience
                  life in all its wonderment and potential
          5)  a  means  of  reducing  the "gravity" flow through mass, thus
              providing reduction of "weight"  or  outright  levitation  of
              that mass
              a)  totally new transport methods (both cargo and people)
              b)  expansion  of  the  populace  into areas  not  easily  or
                  readily accessible by ground transport
              c)  colonization  of  other  celestial bodies including space
                  stations as way stations,  thus offering mining, farming,
                  exploration, general colonization, etc.
              d)  possible  contact  with  other "alien" civilizations  not
                  native to the Earth with the resultant cultural exchanges
