                 Poll says Billions spent on Alternative Therapies

       BOSTON - A  third  of  Americans  seek  relief  from aches and pains
       outside mainstream medicine, spending  nearly  $14 billion a year on
       such therapies as relaxation techniques and herbal  cures,  a survey
       suggests.

       Although that is  only $1 for every $60 spent on all kinds of health
       care, the researchers  estimate that  Americans  actually  pay  more
       visits to providers of unorthodox treatments than they do to primary
       care physicians.

       The work suggests that Americans often bypass conventional  medicine
       when they want  help  for  backaches,  headaches,  stress  and other
       complaints for which doctors too often lack the skills - or the time
       - to cure.

       "Some of these treatments are probably quackery," said Dr. Edward W.
       Campion.  "Some of them are just the  American version of the health
       spa."

       The most common of these therapies are, in order;

            1)  relaxation techniques,
            2)  chiropractic,
            3)  massage,
            4)  imagery,
            5)  spiritual healing,
            6)  commercial weight-loss programs,
            7)  macrobiotics and other lifestyle diets,
            8)  herbal medicine,
            9)  megavitamins,
           10)  self-help groups,
           11)  energy healing,
           12)  biofeedback,
           13)  hypnosis,
           14)  homeopathy,
           15)  acupuncture and
           16)  folk remedies.

       The level of use of unconventional therapies revealed  by the survey
       is far higher than experts had thought.

       The study, based  on  a nationwide telephone survey of 1,539 adults,
       was directed by  Dr.  David M. Eisenberg  of  Boston's  Beth  Israel
       Hospital and published   in  Thursday's  NEW  ENGLAND   JOURNAL   OF
       MEDICINE.  It is  the largest effort yet to measure the use and cost
       of alternative medicine in the United States.

       The study found that 34 percent of Americans said they used at least
       one unconventional therapy in 1990.

       Among other findings:

          Backaches are the No. 1 reason  for  alternative therapies, cited
          by 36 percent of those seeking help.

          The use of unconventional therapy was most common among people 25
          to 49, those with some college education, and those  with  annual
          incomes greater than $35,000.  It was less common among blacks.
