                    Radio Waves Found to Affect Cell Behaviour

           (This article  which appeared in The New York Times on March 30,
            1959 is the first intimation,  apart from the claims of various
            radionic operators,  that  radio  waves  can   affect  cellular
            behaviour.  The  information  comes  somewhat as a shock to all
            physicists judging  by  the   remarks  of  the  physicists  and
            biologists visiting Dr.  Heller's laboratory who  say  "I'll be
            damned".

            We would  remind  our  readers  that  the  method of critically
            tuning a radio frequency to  produce  a  resonant effect with a
            specific cell group in the human body is a routine  performance
            with the more advanced radionic operators..........The Editor

                  Organisms line up in reply to High Pulsed Range

       The discovery that  radio waves can influence the behaviour of cells
       has been reported by a team of scientists.

       It is believed that the discovery  may  have far-reaching effects in
       medicine and in the understanding of basic life processes,  as  well
       as in industry.

       The findings, published  in  two technical journals, have to do with
       the behaviour of many living and non-living  substances in fields of
       radio energy.

       The scientists are  Dr. John H. Heller, Dr. A.A. Teixeira-Pinto  and
       Dr. John L. Cutler of the New England Institute for Medical Research
       in Ridgefield, Conn.  They have found that a variety of substances -
       including carbon, silver,  starch,  polystyrene particles, red blood
       cells and several types of living  microscopic  organisms  -  can be
       oriented by pulsed radio frequencies.

       Perhaps the most  significant  factor in this work  so  far  is  the
       discovery that the  new  technique apparently permits the scientists
       to affect structures inside living  cells.   The  use  of the pulsed
       radio frequency of about twenty-seven megacycles on cells in the

                                      Page 1

       growing root tip  of  a  garlic  plant,  for  example,  created some
       abnormal cells and killed others by  interference with the heredity-
       carrying elements.

       At present the  scientists  cannot  explain  the  phenomenon.    The
       possibility that particles  under  an impressed radio frequency tend
       to line up SO THERE IS MINIMAL DISTORTION  of  the field as close as
       they can come  to  guessing  how  it  works,  but this  leaves  many
       questions unanswered.

       The scientists, however,   are   able   to   reproduce   the  effect
       predictably.

       For example, randomly  swimming   groups   of   tiny,   cigar-shaped
       organisms known as Euglena can be made to swim together  in an east-
       west direction, ALONG  THE  LINES  OF  FORCE in the impressed radio-
       frequency field.

       They all move in straight lines as  though  obeying  the  lanes in a
       swimming meet.  This analogy is extended by the little  "flip turns"
       the Euglena make  when  they reach the end of a "lane" and swim back
       along their original paths.

       Even more astonishing things happen  when  the  radio  frequency  is
       increased a certain  amount.   The  little organisms  SUDDENLY  FLIP
       NINETY DEGREES and all start swimming in a north-south direction.

       Dr. Heller said  that  this  ability  to  "play  these things like a
       piano" has so fascinated his team  that  lights have been burning in
       the laboratory practically every evening and week-end since the work
       began last November.

       "Visiting physicists and biologists usually don't believe  it  until
       they see it work," he said.  "Then the first thing they say is 'I'll
       be damned!'"

       Dr. Heller and  Dr.  Cutler demonstrated the effect on several other
       things, including staphylococcus   germs,  amoebae  and  polystyrene
       particles (tiny synthetic  particles of uniform size).   All  except
       the staphylococci behaved  as  predicted,  lining up east-west under
       one radio frequency and north-south under another.

       Dr. Heller explained that each substance  seemed  to have a FAVOURED
       FREQUENCY for lining  up  with OR against the field.   Euglena,  for
       example, line up  east-west  at  six  megacycles  and north-south at
       about fifteen megacycles.   Staphylococcus   north-south  frequency,
       presuming it has  one,  appears to be one out of the  range  of  the
       institute's present equipment, according to Dr. Heller.

       Radio signals in  the  medium frequency range are being used roughly
       between five megacycles and forty megacycles.  The scientists are at
       work on equipment that will take them  into radar range, or somewhat
       above 100 megacycles.

       The present equipment  consists  of  a radio frequency  source  that
       permits pulsation of   the  signal  at  various  rates  and  powers.
       Pulsing is necessary because a constantly  applied  signal would fry
       any living material.


                                      Page 2

       Wire leads from  the  power source end in electrodes of silver paint
       on the underside of the microscope  slide that is covered with still
       another microscope slide  on which the material to  be  examined  is
       placed.  In this way the experimental material is insulated from the
       electrodes by two  thicknesses of glass and thus exposed only to the
       radio field and not directly to any current carrier.

       Preliminary results from work with  this  equipment  are  carried in
       NATURE, a British scientific publication, and the RES  BULLETIN, the
       American journal.

       The New England  team  got into this work by being dissatisfied with
       explanations offered for the reported  development  of cataracts and
       germ-cell damage in persons WHO WORKED IN RADAR, a  radio  frequency
       considerably higher than   that   being   used   in  the  Ridgefield
       laboratory.

       Some investigators suggested that  the  alleged damage was caused by
       the heating of tissue in the radar beams.  Dr. Heller  did  not like
       this theory and set out to explore other possibilities.

               Alteration of genetic material induced in plant test

       "Four reports of  the  peculiar  behaviour of fat globules in radio-
       frequency fields had been made since 1927," he said, "and we decided
       to see if we could get similar reactions from other things."

       He added that a number of other substances  that lined up AND STRUNG
       TOGETHER UNDER PULSED  RADIO FREQUENCIES were soon  found.   One  of
       their experiments stands out as an important turning point.

       Working with a  microscopic  animal  known  as paramecium they noted
       that a tiny particle within the cell  of  a trapped organism FLIPPED
       BACK AND FORTH according to the impressed field.   This  meant,  Dr.
       Heller explained, that  it  was  possible  TO REACH INSIDE CELLS AND
       AFFECT MANY INTERNAL STRUCTURES.

       That new possibility led to an experiment  in  which  cells  in  the
       growing tip of  a garlic plant were exposed to the  field  for  five
       minutes and then examined twenty-four hours later.

       The scientists reported   finding  several  changes  in  the  cells'
       chromosomes, the heredity-controlling structures.  VIRTUALLY ALL
       the classical aberations known to  be  caused  by ionizing radiation
       and certain poisons were noted, Dr. Heller explained.   This finding
       suggests that radio  frequencies appear to constitute a powerful new
       tool for studying the growth and genetic development of organisms.

       Work along this line has already  resulted  in  the creation of both
       LETHAL MUTATIONS and VIABLE NEW STRAINS of vinegar flies and certain
       bacteria, the scientists said.  They speculated that  this  research
       might find application  in  cancer  treatment  if it turned out that
       radio frequencies COULD BE USED TO SCRAMBLE CHROMOSOMES in malignant
       cells, thereby preventing their further growth.

       In addition, because each substance  seems to have a PREFERRED RADIO
       FREQUENCY to respond  to,  MIXTURES  OF  DIFFERENT   ONES  might  be
       separated with the new technique.


                                      Page 3

       In support of  this  possibility  Dr.  Heller cited experiments that
       showed how foreign substances could  be  made  to  flow over aligned
       polystyrene particles and  how two different strains  of  penicillin
       spores WERE DIFFERENTIATED by the radio-frequency fields.

       Dr. Heller also  remarked  that interest in his experiments had been
       expressed by the oil industry.  Behind  this interest, he explained,
       is the thought  THAT  IF PARTICLES CAN BE ALIGNED  before  they  are
       chemically strung together  into fibres, EXTREMELY STRONG STRANDS of
       the material probably can be created.
