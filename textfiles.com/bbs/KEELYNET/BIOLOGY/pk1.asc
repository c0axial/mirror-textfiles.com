                              Induced Psycho-Kinesis

                      written by Jerry W. Decker for KeelyNet

                (information for this file partly derived from the
                      November 27, 1990 Sun tabloid, page 35)

       Of course, some  of  the articles the tabloids print are known to be
       imaginary, yet they periodically come  up with some very interesting
       articles.  One in particular caught my interest.  Due  to  copyright
       laws, we cannot  print  the  entire  article  although  it can be so
       "rearranged" as to bypass the problem.

       The name of the article is 'Man hit  by  lightning makes object fly'
       on page 35.

       It tells the story of a Russian citizen, Sergei Rostov who claims to
       have been struck   by   lightning  on  8  separate  occasions.    An
       international symposium was held on "unexplained phenomena" in Oslo,
       Norway where Mr. Rostov demonstrated his psycho-kinetic abilities.

       It is claimed  that he can levitate objects by consciously directing
       his thoughts.  Mr. Rostov is now  48  years  of  age.  The lightning
       first struck him at age 9, again at 12, twice in his  20's, twice in
       his 30's, and twice on the same day in 1988.

       Shortly after the  last  episode,  he  noticed  that he could simply
       think of something being moved and  it  would  come  to  pass.   The
       article does not state if he must mentally place the  object  in the
       desired location or  actually  work  out  the  sequences of up, move
       sideways (whatever) and down in steps much akin to animation.

       There are intriguing possibilities  arising  from  such  an ability.
       Could something be "teleported" if it were mentally imaged?  Indeed,
       could something be "materialized" if a suitably stable  pattern were
       sustained?  Could time be altered or light be bent at will?

       Would it be  possible  to  move  things  at a distance, assuming the
       operator were familiar with the surroundings at the target location?
       Is it possible to stop someones heart  or  block  blood  flow to the
       brain with a proper image of the sequence or desired end result?

       Is it possible that such stimulation could engender the development

                                      Page 1





       of new abilities  within  the human brain?  Could this be attributed
       to an extension of the conscious mind into the 90% of the brain
       said to be "unused" by the conscious brain?

       The article on  KeelyNet entitled  VEDA1  postulates  just  such  an
       "extension of consciousness"  through  controlled   stimulation  and
       artificial pumping of the "cerebellic field" (to use Keely's term).

       The brain is  composed  of  the  cerebrum,  the  cerebellum  and the
       medulla oblongata.  Of these the  medulla  transforms  the very weak
       electrical signals of  the  cerebellum  and  cerebrum  int   signals
       capable of operating the senses and muscles in the body.

       The medulla can  be  likened to the coil windings of a solenoid.  It
       has the highest  amount  of  magnetism  in  the  body  besides  that
       generated by the heart.

       Experiments carried out on the Russian lady Kulagina showed that her
       medulla put off waves of pulsing magnetic energy much  stronger than
       that of the Earth's natural magnetic field.  This ONLY occurred when
       she was performing  her  psycho-kinetic  demonstrations.   Based  on
       this, it is obvious that the effect is consciously controllable.

       In the case of pre-pubescent children, massive hormonal fluctuations
       sometimes cause the    psychic    manifestations    classified    as
       "poltergeist" activity.  This  is a result of "un-directed"  psycho-
       kinetic energy.

       The VEDA1 article  indicates  that the body could be so "stimulated"
       through repeated and controlled electrical  surges that possibly the
       medulla might form  a  stronger  link  with  the  cerebellic  and/or
       cerebric instructions.

       There is much  work  to  be  done  in  this  area  with  a  focus on
       repeatability and what  it takes  to  initiate  the  first  results.
       Perhaps this is one of the steps in mankinds further evolution.

       The Siddhi powers  must  surely use such an "awakening"  of  ability
       with the intense  training  being  simply  a process of training the
       operator to "map"   the   abilities.    This   would   prevent   the
       uncontrollable events as experienced in poltergeist activity.

       In addition, it would not be acceptable for people  working  in such
       areas to have  such  little  control of their emotions that the mere
       thought of death or damage directed  at  another person or an object
       would occur just from an unrestrained thought.
