       The following item  appeared  in  the  _NEW TIMES_ tabloid in Miami,
       Florida.  It was taken from a column called "The Straight Dope".

       The NEW TIMES ("Miami's News and Arts Weekly") is an artsy, liberal,
       alternative newspaper.  Some of its  columns  are  rather  off-beat,
       including "The Straight  Dope",  where  readers  write  in  and  ask
       various formidable or  abstract  questions  (such  as  "What  is the
       nature of Light?", or, "Why do we have two eyes and not three?").

       The answers given to these question, while techinically correct, are
       usually written in a cynical or derisive tone.

       Having said that, here is the item:

       From the    _New Times_
                  Vol. 5, N0. 46
                  Miami, Florida
                  March 6-12, 1991
                  pg 8.

       Question:
           I've always cast a jaundice eye on the shenanigans of scientific
           fringe groups.  But my eye is  a  little less yellow when I look
           at Wilhelm Reich.

           Reich claimed  to  have  discovered  a  life  energy  he  called
           "orgone" back in the Thirties.  He made a device that supposedly
           accumulated the  energy,  the  "orgone  accumulator" (ORAC), and
           another that allegedly could  manipulate  it  in  the atmosphere
           called a "cloudbuster".

           Some MDs  who  still subscribe to Reich's theories  publish  the
           _Journal of  Orgonomy_.   I remember one article claiming tomato
           plants grown inside an ORAC produce more and larger tomatoes.

           There's a meteorologist names  James  DeMeo who does research on
           the cloudbuster.

           Plus (and this is the ultimate evidence) Kate Bush  sang  a song
           about the  cloudbuster  on  her Hounds of Love album.  Seeing as
           you're the last word on subjects like this, what's the last word
           on orgone? Yes, no, or maybe? - S.S.

       The reply:
           How about  "sheesh"? I fail to see what a self-described skeptic
           could find appealing about the work of Wilhelm Reich, one of the
           classic scientific screw-balls.

           Reich claimed that 1) he had done  battle with alien spaceships,
           2) he could produce clouds and create rain with his cloudbuster,
           and 3)  his  orgone  boxes  could cure (or at least  ameliorate)
           everything from cancer to the common cold.

           He believed  living  cells  arose  spontaneously  from inorganic
           matter; that  cancer cells are  actually  protozoalike  critters
           that have tails and can swim like fish; and that  orgone  energy
           is what makes the sky blue and causes heat shimmer.

           Even his  terminology was nutsy.  UFOs he called EAs, for Energy
           Alpha.  The alien spaceships  gave  off  DOR, for Deadly ORgone.
           The aliens  themselves  he  called CORE men, for  Cosmic  ORgone
           Engineering.

           Reich was  an intelligent, charismatic man who seems to have had
           only the  most tenous grasp of  reality.   He  was  a  cherished
           associate of  Freud  in  his  early years and made  some  useful
           contributions to  psychoanalytic  theory.   But his ideas became
           more and more eccentric over time and he was eventually expelled
           from the International Psychoanalytic Association.

           He wound up in the U.S. and from  then on it was orgone morning,
           noon, and night.  Reich convinced a great many people, including
           a few scientists like the aforementioned DeMeo,  who  claims  he
           ended a drought with a cloudbuster.

           To this  day  there  are  several  orgonomic societies.  But the
           mainstream view has always been  that  Reich is a quack and that
           his ideas have no scientific basis.  One of his orgone boxes, in
           fact, is on display in St. Louis's National Museum of Quackery.

           In 1956  Reich  was  convicted of shipping orgone  boxes  across
           state lines  in  defiance  of a court order obtained by the Food
           and Drug Administration. He was sent to prison, where he died of
           a heart attack in 1957.

           But his ideas, such as they are,  live on.  A summary of Reich's
           career by science writer Martin Gardner may be found in the fall
           1988 "Skeptical Enquirer"; for a full-length treatment check out
           _Fury on Earth_ by Martin Sharaf. - Cecil Adams
