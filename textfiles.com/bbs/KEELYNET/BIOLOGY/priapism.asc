                              Frog Legs and the Boner

       Frog's legs are  a true aphrodisiac, say researchers.  In fact, they
       can give a man an erection that won't GO AWAY!

       Cornell University researchers  answered  a  call  from  the  French
       Foreign Legion, which complained that its soldiers  in  North Africa
       were being stricken with PRIAPISM - the medical term for an erection
       that won't go away.

       The problem turned  out to be frog's legs, which are PACKED with the
       chemical CANTHARIDIN.

       Also known as SPANISH FLY, the compound  is  found  in  beetles  and
       prized as an aphrodisiac.

       When frogs eat  the beetles, canthardin is absorbed  and  passed  to
       anyone who eats the legs.

       "One meal can  contain  enough  of  the  chemical  to give the diner
       PROLONGED PENIL ERECTIONS," said a Cornell researcher.

       But he warns too much canthardin CAN BE FATAL.
