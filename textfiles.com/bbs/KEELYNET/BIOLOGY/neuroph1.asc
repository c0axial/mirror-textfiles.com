       The Neurophone is  a  device permitting you to hear through the skin
       without the signals ever reaching  your  ears.  I.e. the signals are
       transmitted through the nerves and are interpreted  in your brain by
       the neurons.

       From Bearden "Excalibur Briefing" definitions:

       The neurophone is an instrument for direct electromagnetic input of
       signals into the human brain and nervous system. Invented by Dr. Pat
       Flanagan. His latest  version  clips  an  input  signal  into square
       waves, differentiates it  twice,  then  feeds  the  resulting  noisy
       spikes into the  human  sensory  system.  The  original   signal  is
       impressed into the brain and directly into the mind.

       According to Bearden,  an  adaptation using more than 11 independent
       frequencies and built in accord with  work  by  the  Soviet Lisitsyn
       could conceivably be used to accomplish human mind linkage. Lisitsyn
       paper is said to refer to 11 independent channels in  the brainwaves
       (namely, in the  mind-life-consciousness  connection to the waves of
       dendrite firings that   make  the   brainwaves)   and   these   were
       specifically referred to clipped signals (not sines).

       For those who don't understand the differentiation process, it means
       that the output is proportional to the variation of  signal strength
       at its input.   (the  diagram  below shows how the signal is altered
       and fed into the electrodes)

       It will directly feed the brain and  reproduce sound and information
       directly in the  brain  and mind system, without going  through  the
       auditory system at  all.  The  electrodes are normally placed one on
       the forehead and the other one almost  anywhere,  including  on  the
       foot.

       The square wave   clipper   reduces   the  complex  signals,   their
       overtones, and their modulations to square waves, retaining the

                                      Page 1





       temporal content. When  the  signal  is  introduced  in  the body as
       pulsed voltages, they are modulated directly on the dendrites firing
       of the brain  and  nervous  system,   providing   direct  and  pulse
       modulation of the mindfield component channels.

       Two researchers at  the  University  of  Missouri: Dr.  Donald  York
       (neurophysiologist) and Dr. Thomas Jensen (Speech pathologist) have
       reported identifying and decoding 27 words and syllables in specific
       brain wave patterns  and  correlating  these  EEG patterns with both
       spoken and silently thought words  in  about  40 subjects. (Tales of
       mind reading!)

       There are also 2 patents involved:

       USP 3,393,279   Nervous System Excitation Device (16 Jul 1968)
                       by Gillis Patrick Flanagan

       USP 3,647,970   Method and System for Simplifying Speech Waveforms
                       (7 Mar 1972) by Gillis P. Flanagan

       The information package  from  Rex  research  has   some   excellent
       reprints about it.  One  article was "BioCybernetics II" by G. Harry
       Stine in Analog Science Fact/Fiction  (date  unknown).  At one time,
       DARPA would have  loked  at  it  as  a  possible  way   of  computer
       recognition of EEG patterns.  Flanagan initially found the principle
       while playing with electronic stuff in his parent's home when he was
       a 17 year  old. It was a proof of principle demo of a direct linkage
       between a crystalline electronic circuit and the colloidal system of
       the human nervous system.

       (I think the author meant solid  state  when  he  said  crystalline,
       although I'm more  confused  because he also says that  the  pioneer
       setup was using  6L6  vacuum  tubes  running as a 35 KHz oscillator.
       Also, I'm not  sure about the "colloidal"  characterization  of  the
       nervous system. Anybody knowledgeable in biology out there?)

       The output of the oscillator was amplitude-modulated  by  the output
       of any single   channel  audio  system  through  suitable  impedance
       matching transformers, etc. The 35 KHz signal was then stepped up to
       4,000 volts but at very high impedance  to  a length of twin-lead TV
       antenna wire, to  then  be  fed to electrodes taken  from  a  muscle
       relaxing device. The electrodes were made of 1/16 inch rubber sheet,
       a piece of  copper  window screen, and rubber to cover the screen to
       prevent electrical shocks.

       From the patents, there are many adjustments involved. However, the
       article says: put  a signal into  the  neurophone  input,  peak  the
       frequency, peak the modulation to 100%, and hold the  electrodes  to
       your body, anywhere.  And  you'll  hear  the sounds/music playing in
       your head. It worked better on the  bare skin but it would also work
       through a layer of clothing.

       Dr. Henry Puharich  is said to have developed a similar  device  but
       the pads were one inch copper plates that had to be rubbed along the
       skin to achieve his "fricative effect" to work.

       From some experiments  conducted  at  the  Huyck  Research Center in
       Stamford, Connecticut in June 1963, it was shown that the neurophone
       effect was not the result of

                                      Page 2





             a) the pads acting as electrostatic loudspeaker,
             b) the pads exciting bone conduction of the sound, or
             c) the pads activating the 8th Cranial Nerve.

       He says: We  now  know  that  it  operates  by direct linkage of the
       electronic circuitry with the nervous system through electromagnetic
       fields.  Yet, we don't know how Flanagan cracked the neural code for
       audio data transmission to the proper sector of the brain.

       What happened to the neurophone?

       The Huyck Research Center considered that it could not get a patent
       position because they were already  very  busy  with  all  sorts  of
       patents and production problems: after all, there is  a limit to how
       much new development  can  be  absorbed  by  a  company at one time.
       Anyway, they completely wrote off their corporate research program.

       Dr. Wayne Batteau (now deceased) had  also done considerable work in
       that area. The  last  he  heard  of  Flanaga,  he was  somewhere  in
       California as one of the top experts in pyramidology.

       Big science did  not  kill it but it was complacent and Academia was
       never consulted. At the time of the  article,  the  nueurophone  was
       said to have been dormant for 14 years. By now, it should be clearly
       in the public  domain  as  the patents protection expires  after  17
       years. That also  means  that  someone  who  would start making them
       could also be quickly copied, with all the impact that ensues.

       There was an article published in  "Innergy  News"  in June 1980. It
       said that the neurophone had been out for nearly 5  months.  Several
       people had reported   that   their   ability  to  remember  data  is
       increasing.

       It also mentions that Dr. Sheldon  Deal  of Tucson, the president of
       the Intnl College of Applied Kinesiology, had published  a  paper on
       neurophone research. The  title of the paper was "Meridian Balancing
       by Use of the Neurophone" and it was  reproduced  in its entirety in
       the June 80 issue of Innergy news.

       The skin is said to be both piezo electric and opto  electric,  that
       is when it  is  stimulated  by  an  electric  or  photon  field,  it
       vibrates. If mechanically  stimulated,  it  will  generate  its  own
       electric and photon field. Blind people had been trained to see with
       their fingers in Russia.  Deaf people have been trained to hear with
       their fingertips.  (without the neurophone).

       Dr. Flanagan is  also  the author of the book "Pyramid  Power".  The
       device would use some hyperspatial nested modulation technology. The
       square waves used  are  analogous to the clipped waves that Lisitsyn
       confirmed as carriers of the human  brain  waves.  (remember  the 11
       channels of the  brain?)  The  electrodes  were  made  of  zirconium
       titanate imbedded in  acrylic  to provide maximum impedance match to
       the skin.

       With his research with Dr. Batteau,  Dr.  Flanagan  found  that  the
       nervous system uses  time  ratios  as major sources  of  intelligent
       information.  It was found that speech intelligibility was contained
       in time dominant  ratios  of the speech waveform. Speech quality was
       found to be contained in the dominant frequency ratios.

                                      Page 3





       The neurophone suppresses  the  frequency  domain  and amplifies the
       time domain of the sound signal. This  one reason why the neurophone
       sounds so scratchy when one first begins to listen to it.

       They had also used it to balance meridians of the body.  They simply
       played two minutes of pink noise through the neurophone and retested
       10 acupuncture meridians.  The  meridians  were remaining in balance
       two weeks later. Some of the patients  commented  on  cessations  of
       seizures, improved sleep,  total  relaxation, improved  respiration,
       better concentration and cessation of pain.

       It was also   clearly   established  that  the  neurophone  was  not
       operating by bone conduction.

       Some of the possibilities opened by the neurophone are:

             1. increase in telepathic awareness
             2. Brain/mind link between many people
             3. subliminal learning (played at low volume)
             4. conscious learning by simultaneous  use  of  headphones and
                neurophones
             5. subliminal programs to alter undesirable habits
             6. Control of the aging process by cellular programming
             7. Hearing rendered possible for deaf people

       Much more research  would be needed for electronic  vision  via  the
       skin.

       It is said that the neurophone is made available to the layman as an
       experimental aid to   meditation,   electronic   learning   machine,
       experimental device for balancing bio-energy systems of the body. No
       name or address of Flanagan is given  but he would be 59 year old by
       now (1993).

       His first patent  application  was  when  14 year  old  but  it  was
       rejected on the  basis  that  it  would go against all known laws of
       science. Later on, after an article  ran  by  Life  magazine, he was
       successful in patenting it as he brought the device  for demo to the
       patent examiner and  they  tested it on one of their deaf employees.
       Flanagan was 17 years old then.

       While working on Man-dolphin communication,  he became interested in
       nerve signal information   encoding   and  developed   circuits   to
       duplicate the pattern  recognition  observed  in the nervous system.
       This led to work in cryptography.

       He developed a top secret sound scrambler  virtually  impossible  to
       decode based on  his  reaserch.  He also worked on  reproducing  the
       precise encoding of  the  cochlea and the 8th cranial nerve. When he
       applied for a patent, it was immediately  classified  top  secret by
       the NSA.

       He had spent  14 years on it so he certainly was not  interested  in
       not reaping the  benefits  of  the  research.  So  he challenged the
       secrecy order for 5 years before finally  being  granted a patent on
       it.  Another 5  years  of  research and he developed  a  circuit  to
       recognize the time relationships in the signal waveform and generate
       a time encoded square wave signal.(1978)

       The original neurophone was using 3000 volts via electrodes. The new
       neurophone uses only  50 volt square waves applied via ceramic disks
       to allow the energy field to affect the skin without a current flow.
       It causes the skin to vibrate internally  and  it  can  be  heard by
       others if they place their ears near the point of electrode  contact
       with the skin.

       The basis behind the skin sensing mechanism resides in the Pacinian
       Corpuscule which is   a   special   nerve   neding  that  transforms
       mechanical vibrations or pressure  into  nerve impulses. Until 1980,
       it was tought  that  it  could  only  work  at  low  frequencies  of
       stimulations. IEEE Transactions on Bio-Medical Engineering, Vol BME-
       27, No.10, Oct  80,  had an article on that by Fernando Grandori and
       Antonio Pedotti of  Milan,  Italy:   it   can  react  to  very  high
       frequencies and responds best to square wave stimulus.

       If you take the neurophone electrodes and apply a 50 volt sinusoidal
       audio signal, it will be perceived weakly. If you  use  50  volt but
       with square waves,  the  signal  will be perceived to be 10 times as
       loud.

       Pacinian corpuscules are located  over  the  entire  skins surfaces,
       with greater concentration  in  the finger tips and  sexual  organs.
       (This points at where the neurophone electrodes could be located for
       higher sensitivity!) :-)

       Dr. Flanagan is  also said to have researched bio-energy enhancement
       and would have developed instruments  to measure the response of the
       body to exercise,  clothing,  environment,  diet,  meditation,   and
       thought.

       Unfortunately the article  copy  that  I've  got is truncated. I can
       however spot some key words on the  use  of  a  crystal  receiver to
       detect something about  the bioplasmic field. The  8  Hz  bioplasmic
       signal is said to be in harmony with earth resonance. 8 Hz is a sub-
       harmonic of the  256  Hz  middle  C  of  the scientific music scale.
       Middle C is also the resonant frequency of the King's chamber of the
       Pyramid of Cheops.  8 Hz is also  the  frequency  of  perfect  alpha
       rhythm during deep meditation. The neurophone could then be used for
       generating a 8 Hz state of consciousness.

       I finally read  the  patent  3,647,970.   You should  know  that  it
       indicates exact values for all the components except those which are
       part of the 50 KHz generator.

       The speech waveform  is  converted to a signal having constant upper
       and lower levels  (square wave) with  abrupt  transitions  from  one
       level to the  other,  these  latter being in time correspondence  to
       amplitude changes in the speech waveform that exceed a predetermined
       rate of change  (that  means  high-pass filter). The optimum results
       were found with a high-pass filter  of 12 dB per octave slope from 0
       to 15 KHz. The patent shows two sets of amplifiers and a 6 dB filter
       in series.

       The speech waveform is combined with a high frequency  noise (the 50
       KHz) to mask  signals  of lower amplitude prior to processing of the
       signal.  There is an adjustable load  resistor  at the output of the
       50 KHz generator to permit the amplitude of the masking signal to be
       adjusted to eliminate oscillations caused by noise.

                                       Page





       The part to  square  the wave is made with a Schmitt trigger or very
       high gain amplifiers which saturates quickly, and the signal is then
       clipped with a bridge of diodes.  You  need  at  least  one stage of
       clipping but the  patent  shows two. The amplitude  of  the  masking
       signal should not   be   any   greater   than  required  to  prevent
       oscillation, this in  order  to  minimize   interference   with  the
       processing of the speech waveform.

       The circuit has 13 NPN transistors (MPS3393 type), 5 PNP transistors
       (MPS3640 type), and 8 diodes (1N914 type). There are  2  coils of 10
       mH used as  LC  circuit  with .001 microfarad capacitors. (The extra
       coil and capacitor in the 50 KHz  circuit  are  likely  made  of the
       same). All other  capacitors  are  of  10  microfarad   value.   The
       resistors are mostly  33K value but range amongst 330, 1K, 10K, 33K,
       and 100K. Some of them are adjustable.

       Sounds like it should be easy to build  one! At that time, they were
       using discrete components.  But  why  make an op-amp  with  discrete
       components when you  could  just use IC op-amp. If Flanagan is still
       selling these gizmos, he likely  "solid-stated"  them  for  ease  of
       manufacturing. You would  still  have sections to tune  with  solid-
       state ICs.

       In my info   package,  there  is  a  section  which  looks  like  an
       instruction manual for the Neurophone  Model  50,  the  THINKMAN. It
       would be the 50th neurophone design developed by Dr.  Flanagan. They
       describe it as  working  with  a  20  V  RMS  electric  field on its
       electrodes (called transducers).   Maximum  coupling of the electric
       field is said to be provided by the transducers discs  (1 inch diam)
       being made of   fragile   Zirconium  Titanate  which  has  the  same
       dielectric constant as  the  human  skin  (imbedded  in  acrylic  to
       protect it). A stethoscope used near the electrodes  will be able to
       detect local vibrations of the skin.

       The audio signal  will  be perceived in the person's head. There are
       no hazardous voltages or currents  between  the  two  electrodes (20
       VAC).  There are no radio frequency carriers involved  in the action
       of the neurophone.   (He  must  have  removed  that 35 KHz modulated
       waves?) It operates from a 9 volt  radio battery and lasts 10 hours.
       The LED probably does not help to shorten battery life.

       As to location of the electrodes, at first, you have  to locate them
       on your temples  (to  learn  to hear the scratchy sound). After much
       listening, you can  place  them  anywhere  on  the  body.  One  user
       reported excellent listening with one disc on the soft  flesh of one
       leg, and the  other  on  the  soft  skin  of  the  stomach.  But the
       neurophone must be  operated  at   higher  volume  than  when  using
       temples.  (this would  make  a  good  radio  receiver   for   secret
       agents!).

       The brain may  initially  have difficulty in recognizing the signals
       due to gaps  in perception. Also,  the  user  may  not  be  able  to
       perceive certain frequencies  and time domains in  portions  of  the
       audio spectrum.  These  holes  will  disappear with use as the brain
       learns to recognize these sounds.

       Since it stimulates  some unused  pathways  to  the  brain,  it  may
       increase intelligence and neural efficiency. Many  long  term  users
       reported increased awareness, telepathic ability, out of body

                                      Page 6





       experiences, better memory,  and increased auditory frequency range.
       Dr. Flanagan is  said  to  have  developed   extremely  high  neural
       efficiency scores from the long use of the device.  (What's a neural
       efficiency score?)

       A commercial pilot reported recovery of hearing damaged due to aural
       trauma from loud engine noise heard while on his job.  Remember that
       it is still considered an experimental device.

       G. Harry Stine  wrote  a  book  "Silicon Gods" published by Dell and
       discusses the possibility of using  the  device  as  a part of mind-
       computer link in  which  the  power  of  the  human  mind  could  be
       amplified by millions  of time.  That should be a good to read. Must
       be Lawnmower Man with a 100 HP engine  on it! (Thinking of the movie
       :-) although I have not seen it).  Bearden was also  expressing  the
       same idea in Excalibur Briefing but to link multiple minds together.

       (He referred to  the group mind linkage "gestalt" that would combine
       to create a  larger, super intelligent  being  which  Bearden  named
       ZARG.  The main fear with such a 'creation' was that  it  might come
       to consciousness, take  a look around, talk with other beings of its
       mental stature and decide how we  humans  had  screwed up the Earth,
       then using its power, it would destroy us all....a  tongue  in cheek
       comment, I hope....VANGARD)  It sounds like they intended to start a
       Neurophone Magazine and some user group.

       I guess I   am   what  you  call  a  lurker.   I  have  enjoyed  the
       conversations immensely, but hesitate to jump in as this is very new
       to me.  However, when you mentioned  Dr.  Patrick Flanagan.  I could
       contain my self  no  longer.  I am associated with  a  company  that
       makes nutritional programs.    The   founder   of  our  company  Dr.
       Christopher Hills and Dr. Flanagan  have  had a long association and
       last year,  we   began  to  market  the  newest  addition   to   our
       nutritional formulas,"Microclusters".  You know his past history.
       He holds a  number of patents on electronic devices and has traveled
       around the world five times researching  anti-aging  therapies.  For
       the past 25  years  he  has  focused on colloidal cluster  chemistry
       which has led    to   the   breakthrough   discovery   of   Flanagan
       Microclusters.  His wife, Dr. Gael  Crystal  Flanagan  has spent the
       last eight years in collloidal cluster chemistry research  with  her
       husband.  They were  married  and  spent  their wedding night in the
       Kings Chamber of  the  most  famous  pyramid.   A  first.   A  child
       prodigy; Dr. Flanagan has done his finest work to date with the
       Microclusters.  I am  living  testimony to that.  I  stay  saturated
       with this Newage  Nutrition.  The Flanagans live in Sedona, Arizona.
       At our meetings  we  have  had numerous  live  teleconferences  with
       them....but they live  and  do  their  research  reclusively.  I  am
       looking forward to  meeting  them at a company workshop in Sedona in
       June of this year.  As you see I am most enthusiastic about what I

       do and super  nutrition.  Please feel free to ask me any thing for I
       live and breathe nutrition.

       Glad to know that someone knows where Dr. Flanagan  is at this time.
       Some one was  asking  if  the  neurophones were still being sold and
       where they could be obtained. I read in a file on Keelynet (214-324-
       3501) that these things were selling  for  $1,000  at  one  time and
       there was now a Japanese company making a new model  for  $150.  The
       new model is  know  as  "Silent  Nights"  but there are no addresses
       mentioned. If you have the chance  to  talk to Dr. Flanagan, we were
       wondering whether that technology has finally allowed  transmissions
       of images to the brain in a same fashion.  You might also ask him if
       he'd be willing  to participate in a conference on Compuserve one of
       those nights. I'm sure that a few other participants would find some
       questions to ask about neurophones and microclusters.

       FWIW, I _did_ finally locate the little pamphlet that I have on the
       Neurophone. From a brief look, I don't  see that it covers very much
       that you haven't mentioned already.

       For the record,  it's  called:  "The  Neurophone  Manual",  subtitle
       "Instruction Booklet for  Neurophone Mk XI". Published by "Source of
       Innergy, Ltd., 9989 E. Morrill Way,  Tucson,  AZ 85715." Copyrighted
       1979 by G. Patrick Flanagan, Ph.D.

       It is a  small  format,  42  page  booklet, obviously  inexpensively
       produced, and without  much  proofing, I'd guess. The first 15 pages
       are Flanagan's, and the remaining pages are reprints of Bearden.

       I should say that the tone of the  pamphlet  is  pretty  breathless,
       e.g. "Col. Bearden believes that the _Neurophone_  is  the  _key_ to
       linking consciousness. He  believes  that  it may hold the answer to
       solving ALL the problems of mankind."  (emphasis  in  original. page
       14). Another example:

       "In 1974, two  years  after I wrote _Pyramid Power_,  we  spent  the
       night in the  Great  Pyramid...  I  can  say that I had a full blown
       _Kundilini Release_.  After that  experience,  I  became  a  _trance
       medium_. ..." (emphasis in original. page 6).

       BTW, he also  claims  that  after a Life magazine article  came  out
       about the Neurophone,  we  was  offered up to $8,000,000 (!) for the
       patent rights.

       The initial patent (3,393,279) was  not  relying  on square waves to
       transmit the signal, just on modulated RF (20-200 KHz).  30  KHz was
       the most oftten  used  frequency.  They  even used a coil around the
       head of a person (besides using electrodes).

       Each individual nervous system is  at  least  somewhat  selective in
       respect to the  frequencies  to  which  it  is  most  responsive.  A
       frequency to which  the  nervous  system of a person is demonstrably
       responsive can be determined by varying the frequency of the carrier

                                      Page 8





       waves that are modulated by an information signal, and measuring the
       frequency of such  waves  that  produce the sensation of hearing the
       sounds corresponding to the modulating  signal.  This  is likely why
       the models had an ajustable carrier frequency. Note that the carrier
       only cannot be heard unless there is an audio modulation  in it. The
       brain probably rejects   the   signal   as   noise.  The  modulation
       essentially truncates the top of the  square  waves.  (That might be
       the old principle:  I  think that the new one is more  likely  pulse
       width modulation, i.e. the square waves don't have the same widths).

       The width of the entering pulse with no information must be equal to
       the critical reaction  time  (C.R.T.:  typically 12 microseconds) of
       the nervous system at any given instance.  A  pulse  with  the wrong
       width will only partially load the neurone. If you  use a sinusoidal
       waveform, the width  of the wave will coincide with that C.R.T. only
       over a narrow period.  This is why square waves are used.

       The electrodes can be placed on  or  near  various  portions  of the
       body, such portions preferably being near (within one  inch  of) the
       spinal cord, or where nerves are concentrated close to the skin. The
       upper frequency limit  of auditory perception is extended, while low
       frequency perception is more difficult  until after some practice in
       listening.

       In the old  patent with vacuum tubes, the output of  the  source  of
       modulated electromagnetic waves is preferably at least about 1 watt.
       However, the study  by Huyck Research Center shows that at the right
       frequency, less than 10^-4 (or 0.0001)  watt is all what's needed to
       produce neurophonic effect   when   connected   to    the   temples.
       Stereophonic effects have been produced with electrodes on temple.

       They don't say what would happen with 2 neurophones connected at the
       same time. Would it be a way to produce stereo signals?

       I was browsing  through  the  ads in Popular Electronics and saw the
       word neurophone listed  there  under  the  paragraph  "Off-the-Shelf
       Hardware". They don't give any price and they say  "see  details  in
       catalog". (their cat  is  $4  w/o  order, $2 with). My guess is that
       neurophone will be quite expensive  if  Flanagan  dared selling them
       for $1K and  the  Japanese crank them out at $150 each.  If  someone
       checks it out, please let us all know?

       Because of a  thread  I  found  here,  I  contacted  ComsumerTronics
       regarding the Neurophone. After reviewing the catalog description, I

                                      Page 9





       am more confused about the device. The ConsumerTronics text suggests
       that the device  employes  a kind of pulse code modulation to encode
       information. The device   seems   to   accomodate   several   output
       transducers (induction coil, piezo-electric, voice coil...).

       >>Reply<<
       Ouch! Really expensive!

       The last patent number that I mentioned had a circuit  diagram  with
       components values in  it,  i.e.  all you need to build one. It was a
       transistorized version although someone "skilled-in-the-trade" could
       readily convert it to integrated circuit version.

       I'm not sure that a second channel  is really workable.  And I don't
       see why they have all these forms of output (low, 8  ohm, 50-600 ohm
       impedance, high voltage).  The  carrier  frequency input ought to be
       delivered with the device because  it  is  inherent  to  the  proper
       function of the neurophone.

       Vangard Note...

          The above  file  offers  excellent  information   and  we  really
          appreciate the  open sharing of such.  However, a few words based
          on our researches into this area.   In  some of Flanagans earlier
          writings, he indicates that mental telepathy, a 'thought linkage'
          could be effected.

          The human nervous system as a whole vibrates in a frequency range
          of about 50Kcps to about 100Kcps (Hertz is not a  term  respected
          by those  in  alternative  studies).  The frequency in control at
          any given  time is determined  by  dozens  of  factors  including
          stress, nervous   excitation,   physical   stimulation,    mental
          alertness or  overall  tiredness,  food  being  processed  in the
          system, etc.  As a result, the nervous system continually changes
          its resonant frequency.

          Flanagan found  a  way  to  sample  the  current  nervous  system
          frequency.  That frequency was then artificially  duplicated  and
          modulated with   the  audio  component.   When  this  signal  was
          injected into the body, the two  carriers  canceled  leaving only
          the audio  component.   Phasing obviously plays  a  part  in  the
          efficiency of such a system.

                                      Page 10





          The interesting point of this, is that when two (or more) systems
          are "in  rapport/resonance",  they  communicate.   So, if two (or
          more) people are experimenting  with  such  a  device,  AND their
          nervous systems  come into resonance, they will  experience  mind
          linkage as per Bearden.

          This applies  also  to  the  GESTALT  principle.   GESTALT can be
          loosely translated  to  mean   "group   mind".   It  is  somewhat
          correlated to the TETRACTYS principle as outlined  in NEUTRAL1 on
          KeelyNet.  If each atom has a VERY limited form of consciousness,
          then by adding more atoms to form molecules, we get a higher form
          of consciousness   as   a   direct   result   of   the   combined
          intelligences.  And in turn, as  molecules  combine  to form mass
          aggregations, the  resultant  structures have a  higher  form  of
          "grouped" consciousness.  (that is why we use the term, ESCAPE to
          a higher order....)

          Two points  we  should  mention  in  regard to "higher" orders of
          consciousness:

             1)  The response time to outside stimuli is reduced due to the
                 need to   adaptively   coordinate   all   the   components
                 comprising the conscious structure
             2)  Resonance  occurs  at ALL stages/orders from  the  simpler
                 levels, to  the  next  highest,  to the next highest, etc.
                 Thus, atoms   respond    at    higher   frequences,   mass
                 aggregations of  atoms in the form of molecules  harmonize
                 to form yet other frequencies, and those molecules in turn
                 form the   overall   mass   aggregate  that  has  its  own
                 frequencies.....as we go  up  the scale of complexity, the
                 wavelengths extend   to   cause   responses    at    lower
                 frequencies.

          For those  into computers, the idea of the TRANSPUTER or parallel
          processing is very similar, in  that  more  computing power comes
          from the combination of more processors along  with  a  means  of
          keeping track of who is doing what.  (requiring faster clocks)

          In natural  systems,  such  a  means of keeping order from a vast
          array of                  otherwise                   independent
          organisms/consciousnesses/computers takes the form of an ADAPTIVE
          response.  This  again ties into the fascinating  work  of  Illya
          Prigogine on Chaos and Dissipative Structures.

          BTW...I called  out to Sedona, AZ (602) with the very slight hope
          that Gillis Patrick Flanagan might  be  listed.  Not so, the only
          Flanagan in Sedona proper (city only, not suburbs) was a Brian.
