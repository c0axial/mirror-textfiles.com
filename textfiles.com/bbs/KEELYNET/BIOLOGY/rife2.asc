              From the Annual Report of the Board of Regents of
   
                     THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION - 1944
   
                          The Universal Microscope
   
   It is only  a  reasonable supposition, but already, in one instance, a
   very successful and highly commendable  achievement on the part of Dr.
   Royal Raymond Rife of San Diego, California, who, for  many years, has
   built and worked  with  light  microscopes  which  far  surpasses  the
   theoretical limitations of the ordinary variety of instrument, all the
   Rife scopes possessing superior ability  to  attain high magnification
   with accompanying high resolution.
   
   The largest and  most  powerful  of  these, the Universal  Microscope,
   developed in 1933, consists of 5,682 parts and is so called because of
   its adaptability in  all  fields  of  microscopical  work, being fully
   equipped with separate substage condenser  units  for  transmitted and
   monochromatic beam dark-field, polarized, and slit-ultra illumination,
   including also a  special  device  for  crystallography.   The  entire
   optical system of  lenses and prisms as well as the illuminating units
   are made of block-crystal quartz, quartz  being especially transparent
   to ultraviolet radiations.
   
   This illuminating unit  used  for  examining the filterable  forms  of
   disease organisms contains 14 lenses and prisms, 3 of which are in the
   high-intensity incandescent lamp,  4 in the Risley prism, and 7 in the
   achromatic condenser which, incidentally,  has a numerical aperture of
   1.40.  Between the source of light and the specimen  are subtended two
   circular, wedge-shaped, block-crystal quartz prisms for the purpose of
   polarizing the light  passing through the specimen, polarization being
   the practical application of the theory  that  light  waves vibrate in
   all planes perpendicular   to  the  direction  in   which   they   are
   propagated.
   
   Therefore, when light  comes  into contact with a polarizing prism, it
   is divided or split into two beams,  one of which is refracted to such
   an extent that  it is reflected to the side of the prism  without,  of
   course, passing through   the   prism   while  the  second  ray,  bent
   considerably less, is  thus enabled  to  pass  through  the  prism  to
   illuminate the specimen.
   
   When the quartz  prisms  on  the universal microscope,  which  may  be
   rotated with vernier  control  through  360  degrees,  are  rotated in
   opposite directions, they serve to bend the transmitted beams of light
   at variable angles of incidence while, at the same time, a spectrum is
   projected up into  the  axis of the  microscope,  or  rather  a  small
   portion of the  spectrum  to  the other, going all the  way  from  the
   infrared to the ultraviolet.
   
   NOW, WHEN THAT  PORTION  OF  THE SPECTRUM IS REACHED IN WHICH BOTH THE
   ORGANISM AND THE COLOR BAND VIBRATE  IN  EXACT  ACCORD,  ONE  WITH THE
   OTHER, A DEFINITE CHARACTERISTIC SPECTRUM IS EMITTED BY THE ORGANISM.
   
   In the case of the filter-passing form of the BACILLUS  TYPHOSUS,  for
   instance, A BLUE  SPECTRUM  IS  EMITTED  AND THE PLANE OF POLARIZATION
   DEVIATED PLUS (+) 4.8 DEGREES.
   
   
                                   Page 1
   



The predominating chemical  constituents  of  the  organism  are  next
   ascertained after which the quartz  prisms  are  adjusted  or  set, by
   means of vernier control, to minus (-) 4.8 degrees (again  in the case
   of the filter-passing  form  of  the  BACILLUS  TYPHOSUS)  so that the
   opposite angle of refraction may be obtained.
   
   
   A MONOCHROMATIC BEAM  OF  LIGHT,  CORRESPONDING   **EXACTLY**  TO  THE
   FREQUENCY OF THE  ORGANISM (for Dr. Rife has found that  EACH  DISEASE
   ORGANISM RESPONDS TO  AND  HAS  A DEFINITE AND DISTINCT WAVE LENGTH, a
   fact confirmed by British medical  research  workers)  IS THEN SENT UP
   THROUGH THE SPECIMEN AND THE DIRECT TRANSMITTED LIGHT,  THUS  ENABLING
   THE OBSERVER TO  VIEW  THE ORGANISM STAINED IN ITS TRUE CHEMICAL COLOR
   and revealing ITS  OWN  INDIVIDUAL  STRUCTURE  IN  A  FIELD  WHICH  IS
   BRILLIANT WITH LIGHT.
   
   The objectives used on the universal microscope are a 1.12 dry lens, a
   1.16 water immersion, a 1.18 oil immersion, and a 1.25  oil immersion.
   The rays of  light  refracted  by the specimen enter the objective and
   are then carried up the tube IN PARALLEL  RAYS  through 21 light bends
   to the ocular,  A  TOLERANCE OF LESS THAN ONE WAVE LENGTH  OF  VISIBLE
   LIGHT ONLY BEING  PERMITTED  IN  THE  CORE  BEAM,  OR  CHIEF  RAY,  OF
   ILLUMINATION.
   
   Now, instead of the light rays starting  up  the  tube  in  a parallel
   fashion, TENDING TO CONVERGE AS THEY RISE HIGHER AND  FINALLY CROSSING
   EACH OTHER, arriving  at the ocular SEPARATED BY CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE
   as would be the case with an ordinary  microscope,  IN  THE  UNIVERSAL
   TUBE THE RAYS ALSO START THEIR RISE PARALLEL TO EACH  OTHER  BUT, JUST
   AS THEY ARE ABOUT TO PULL THEM OUT PARALLEL AGAIN, ANOTHER PRISM BEING
   INSERTED EACH TIME THE RAYS ARE ABOUT READY TO CROSS.
   
   These prisms, inserted  in  the  tube,  which are adjusted and held in
   alignment by micrometer screws of 100  threads  to the inch in special
   tracks made of magnelium (magnelium having the closest  coefficient of
   expansion of any metal to quartz), are separated by a distance OF ONLY
   30 MILLIMETERS.
   
   Thus, THE GREATEST DISTANCE THAT THE IMAGE in the universal microscope
   IS PROJECTED THROUGH  ANY  ONE  MEDIA,  EITHER  QUARTZ  OR  AIR, IS 30
   MILLIMETERS INSTEAD OF THE 160, 180,  OR  190  MILLIMETERS  as  in the
   empty or air-filled  tubes  of  an  ordinary  microscope,   the  total
   distance which the  light  rays  travel  ZIGZAG  FASHION  through  the
   universal tube being 449 MILLIMETERS,  although the physical length of
   the tube itself is 229 millimeters.
   
   It will be  recalled  that if one pierces a black strip  of  paper  or
   cardboard with the point of a needle and then brings the card up close
   to the eye  so that the hole is in the optic axis, a small brilliantly
   lighted object will appear LARGER  AND  CLEARER,  REVEALING  MORE FINE
   DETAIL, than if  it  were  viewed from the same distance  without  the
   assistance of the card.
   
   This is explained  by  the fact that the beam of light passing through
   the card is very narrow, the rays entering  the  eye, therefore, being
   practically parallel, whereas without the card the  beam  of  light is
   much wider and   the  DIFFUSION  CIRCLES  MUCH  LARGER.   It  is  this
   principle of parallel rays in the universal microscope and the
   
   
   
                                   Page 2
   



resultant shortening of  projection distance between any two blocks or
   prisms plus the  fact that objectives  can  thus  be  substituted  for
   oculars, these "oculars"  being THREE MATCHED PAIRS OF  10-MILLIMETER,
   7-MILLIMETER, AND 4-MILLIMETER OBJECTIVES IN SHORT MOUNTS, which would
   make possible not only the unusually high magnification and resolution
   but which SERVE  TO  ELIMINATE ALL DISTORTION AS WELL AS ALL CHROMATIC
   AND SPHERICAL ABERRATION.
   
        Quartz slides with especially  thin quartz cover glasses are used
   when a tissue section or culture slant is examined, the tissue section
   itself also being  very  thin.  An additional observational  tube  and
   ocular which yield  a magnification of 1,800 diameters are provided so
   that that portion  of the specimen  which  it  is  desired  should  be
   examined may be  located and so that the observer can  adjust  himself
   more readily when viewing a section at a high magnification.
   
        The universal  stage is a double rotating stage graduated through
   360 degrees in  quarter-minute  are   divisions,   the  upper  segment
   carrying the mechanical stage having a movement of 40 degrees, plus or
   minus.  Heavily constructed  joints  and  screw  adjustments  maintain
   rigidity of the  microscope  which  weighs  200  pounds  and stands 24
   inches high, the bases of the scope  being  nickel  cast-steel plates,
   accurately surfaced, and equipped with three leveling  screws  and two
   spirit levels set  at  angles  of 90 degrees. The coarse adjustment, a
   block thread screw with 40 threads  to  the  inch,  slides  in a 1 1/2
   dovetail which gibes directly onto the pillar post.  The weight of the
   quadruple nosepiece and  the  objective system is taken care of by the
   intermediate adjustment at the top  of  the  body  tube. The stage, in
   conjunction with a hydraulic life, acts as a lever  in  operating  the
   fine adjustment. A  6-gauge  screw  having  100 threads to the inch is
   worked through a  gland  into  a hollow,  glycerine-filled  post,  the
   glycerine being displaced and replaced at will as the  screw is turned
   clockwise or anticlockwise,  allowing  a  5-to  -1  ratio  on the lead
   screw. This, accordingly,  assures   complete   absence  of  drag  and
   inertia. The fine adjustment being 700 times more sensitive  then that
   of ordinary microscopes,  the  length  of  time  required to focus the
   universal ranges up   to  1  1/2   hours   which,   while   on   first
   consideration, may seem  a disadvantage, is after  all  but  a  slight
   inconvenience when compared  with  the  many years of research and the
   hundreds of thousands of dollars spent and being spent in an effort to
   isolate and to look upon disease-causing organisms in their true form.
   
        Working together back in 1931  and  using one of the smaller Rife
   microscope having a magnification and resolution of  17,000 diameters,
   Dr. Rife and   Dr.   Arthur   Isaac  Kendall,  of  the  department  of
   bacteriology of Northwestern University  Medical  School, were able to
   observe and demonstrate  the presence of the filter-passing  forms  of
   BACILLUS TYPHOSUS. An  agar  slant  culture  of the Rawlings strain of
   BACILLUS TYPHOSUS was first prepared  by  Dr.  Kendall  and inoculated
   into 6 cc. of "Kendall" K Medium, a medium rich in protein but poor in
   peptone and consisting of 100 mg. of dries hog intestine  and 6 cc. of
   tyrode solution (containing   neither  glucose  nor  glycerine)  which
   mixture is shaken well so as to moisten the dried intestine powder and
   then sterilized in  the  autoclave,   15   pounds   for   15  minutes,
   alterations of the  medium being frequently necessary  depending  upon
   the requirements for  different  organisms.  Now, after a period of 18
   hours in this K Medium, the culture was passed through a Berkefeld "N"
   filter, a drop of the filtrate being added to another 6 cc. of K
   
   
   
                                   Page 3
   



Medium and incubated  ar  37  degrees  C. Forty-eight hours later this
   same process was repeated, the "N"  filter  again  being  used,  after
   which it was  noted  that the culture no longer responded  to  peptone
   medium, growing now  only in the protein medium. When again, within 24
   hours, the culture was passed through  a  filter-the  finest Berkefeld
   "W" filter, a drop of the filtrate was once more added  to  6 cc. of K
   Medium and incubated  at  37  degrees  c., a period of 3 days elapsing
   before a new culture was transferred  to  K  Medium  and yet another 3
   days before a new culture was prepared. Then, viewed under an ordinary
   microscope, these cultures were observed to be turbid and to reveal no
   bacilli whatsoever. When  viewed  by means of dark-field  illumination
   and oil-immersion lens,  however,  the  presence  of  small,  actively
   motile granules was established,  although  nothing  at  all  of their
   individual structure could be ascertained. Another  period  of  4 days
   was allowed to  elapse  before  these  cultures  were transferred to K
   Medium and incubated at 37 degrees C. for 24 hours when they were then
   examined under the Rife microscope  where,  as  was mentioned earlier,
   the filterable typhoid bacilli, emitting a blue spectrum,  caused  the
   plane of polarization  to  be deviated plus 4.8 degrees. Then when the
   opposite angle of refraction was obtained  by  means  of adjusting the
   polarizing prisms to minus 4.8 degrees and the cultures illuminated by
   a monochromatic beam  coordinated  in  frequency  with   the  chemical
   constituents of the  typhoid  bacillus,  small  oval  actively motile,
   bright turquoise-blue bodies were observed at a magnification of 5,000
   diameters, in high contrast to the  colorless and motionless debris of
   the medium. These observations were repeated eight times, the complete
   absence of these  bodies  in uninoculated control K Media  also  being
   noted.
   
        To further  confirm  their  findings,  Drs. Rife and Kendall nest
   examined 18-hour-old cultures which  had been inoculated into K Medium
   and incubated at  37 degrees C., since it is just  at  this  stage  of
   growth in this medium and at this temperature that the cultures become
   filterable.  And, just  as  had  been anticipated, ordinary dark-field
   examination revealed unchanged, long, actively motile bacilli; bacilli
   having granules within their substance;  and  free-swimming,  actively
   motile granules; while under the Rife microscope were demonstrated the
   same long, unchanged,  almost colorless bacilli; bacilli,  practically
   colorless, inside and at one end of which was a turquoise-blue granule
   resembling the filterable  forms  of  the  typhoid bacillus; and free-
   swimming, small, oval, actively motile,  turquoise-blue  granules.  By
   transplanting the cultures  of the filter-passing organisms  or  virus
   into a broth,  they were seen to change over again into their original
   rodlike forms.
   
        At the same time that these findings  of  Drs.  Rife  and Kendall
   were confirmed by Dr. Edward C. Rosenow, of the Mayo  Foundation,  the
   magnification with accompanying  resolution  of 8,000 diameters of the
   Rife microscope, operated by Dr. Rife,  was  checked  against  a dark-
   field oil-immersion scope operated by Dr. Kendall and  an  ordinary 2-
   mm. oil-immersion objective,  x 10 ocular, Zeiss scope operated by Dr.
   Rosenow at a magnification of 900 diameters.  Examinations of gram and
   safranin-stained films of  culture  of  Bacillus  typhosus,  gram  and
   safranin-stained films of  blood  and  of  the  sediment of the spinal
   fluid from a case of acute poliomyelitis  were  made  with  the result
   that bacilli,     streptococci,     erythrocytes,    polymorphonuclear
   leukocytes, and lymphocytes  measuring  nine times the diameter of the
   same specimens observed under the Zeiss scope at a magnification and
   
   
   
                                   Page 4
   



resolution of 900  diameters, were revealed with unusual clarity. Seem
   under the dark-field microscope were  moving bodies presumed to be the
   filterable turquois-blue bodies of the typhoid bacillus  which, as Dr.
   Rosenow has declared  in  his  report  (Observations on filter-passing
   forms of Eberthella-typhi-Bacillus typhosus - and of the streptococcus
   from poliomyelitis, Proc.  Staff Meeting  Mayo Clinic, July 13, 1932),
   were so "unmistakably demonstrated" with Rife microscope,  while under
   the Zeiss scope  stained  and  hanging-drop  preparations  of  clouded
   filtrate culture were found to be  uniformly  negative.  With the Rife
   microscope also were demonstrated brownish-gray cocci  and  diplococci
   in hanging-drop preparations  of  the  filtrates of streptococcus from
   poliomyelitis. These cocci and diplococci,  similar  in size and shape
   to those seen in the culture although of more uniform  intensity,  and
   characteristic of the  medium  in which they had been cultivated, were
   surrounded by a clear halo about  twice  the  width  of  that  at  the
   margins of the debris and of the Bacillus typhosus.  Stained  films of
   filtrates and filtrate  sediments examined under the Zeiss microscope,
   and hanging-drop, dark-field  preparations   revealed   no  organisms,
   however. Brownish-gray cocci and diplococci of the exact same size and
   density as those  observed  in  the  filtrates  of  the  streptococcus
   cultures were also  revealed in hanging-drop preparations of the virus
   of poliomyelitis under the Rife microscope,  while no organisms at all
   could be seen  in either the stained films of filtrates  and  filtrate
   sediments examined with   the   Zeiss   scope   or   in   hanging-drop
   preparations examined by means of the dark-field. Again using the Rife
   microscope at a magnification of 8,000  diameters,  numerous nonmotile
   cocci and diplococci of a bright-to-pale pink in color  were  seen  in
   hanging-drop preparations of  filtrates  of Herpes encephalitic virus.
   Although these were  observed to be  comparatively  smaller  then  the
   cocci and diplococci  of the streptococcus and poliomyelitis  viruses,
   they were shown  to  be  of  fairly  even  density,  size and form and
   surrounded by a halo. Again, both  the  dark-field  and  Zeiss  scopes
   failed to reveal  any  organisms,  and  none of the three  microscopes
   disclosed the presence  of such diplococci in hanging-drop preparation
   of the filtrate  of  a normal rabbit  brain.  Dr.  Rosenow  has  since
   revealed these organisms   with   the   ordinary   microscope   at   a
   magnification of 1,000  diameters  by  means  of  his special staining
   method and with the electron microscope  at  a magnification of 12,000
   diameters.  Dr. Rosenow has expressed the opinion that  the  inability
   to see these  and  other  similarly  revealed  organisms  is  due, not
   necessarily to the minuteness of the organisms, but rather to the fact
   that they are of a nonstaining, hyaline  structure.  Results  with the
   Rife microscopes, he  thinks,  are  due  to  the  "ingenious   methods
   employed rather than   to  excessively  high  magnification."  He  has
   declared also, in the report mentioned  previously,  that "Examination
   under the Rife microscope of specimens containing objects visible with
   the ordinary microscope, leaves no doubt of the accurate visualization
   of objects or  particulate  matter  by  direct  observation   at   the
   extremely high magnification obtained with this instrument."
   
        Exceedingly high  powers  of magnification with accompanying high
   powers of resolution may be realized with all of the Rife microscopes,
   one of which,  having  magnification   and  resolution  up  to  18,000
   diameters, is now  being  used  at  the  British  School  of  Tropical
   Medicine in England.  In  a  recent  demonstration  of  another of the
   smaller Rife scopes (May 16,1942) before  a group of doctors including
   Dr. J.H.Renner, of Santa Barbara, Calif.; Dr. Roger A. Schmidt, of San
   Francisco, Calif.; Dr.   Lois  Bronson  Slade,  of  Alameda,   Calif.;
   Dr.Lucile B. Larkin, of Bellingham, Wash.; Dr. E. F. Larkin, of
   
   
                                   Page 5
   



Bellingham, Wash.; and  Dr. W.  J. Gier, of San Diego, Calif., a Zeiss
   ruled grading was  examined,  first   under   an  ordinary  commercial
   microscope equipped with a 1.8 high dry lens and X 10 ocular, and then
   under the Rife  microscope.  Whereas 50 lines were revealed  with  the
   commercial instrument and  considerable aberration, both chromatic and
   spherical noted, only 5 lines were  seen  with the Rife scope, these 5
   lines being so highly magnified that they occupied the  entire  field,
   without any aberration  whatsoever  being  apparent.  Dr. Renner, in a
   discussion of his observations, stated  that  "The entire field to its
   very edges and across the center had a uniform clearness  that was not
   true on the conventional instrument." Following the examination of the
   grading, an ordinary  unstained blood film was observed under the same
   two microscopes. In this instance,  100  cells  were  seen  to  spread
   throughout the field of the commercial instrument while  but  10 cells
   filled the field of the Rife scope.
   
        The universal  microscope,  of  course, is the most powerful Rife
   scope, possessing a resolution of 31,000  diameters  and magnification
   of 60,000 diameters. With this it is possible to view  the interior of
   the `pin-point' cells,  those cells situated between the normal tissue
   cells and just visible under the ordinary  microscope,  and to observe
   the smaller cells which compose th interior of these  pin-point cells.
   When one of  these smaller cells in magnified, still smaller cells are
   seen within its structure. And when one of the still smaller cells, in
   its turn, is magnified, it, too, is  seen  to  be  composed of smaller
   cells.  Each of  the  16  times  this  process  of  magnification  and
   resolution can be  repeated, it is demonstrated that there are smaller
   cells within the smaller cells, a fact  which amply testifies as to th
   magnification and resolving  power  obtainable  with   the   universal
   microscope.
   
        More then  20,000 laboratory cultures of carcinoma were grown and
   studied over a period of 7 years by  Dr.  Rife  and  his assistants in
   what, at the time, appeared to be a fruitless effort  to  isolate  the
   filter-passing form, or  virus,  which Dr. Rife believed to be present
   in this condition.   Then,  in  1932,   the  reactions  in  growth  of
   bacterial cultures to  light  from  the  rare   gasses  was  observed,
   indicating a new  approach  to  the  problem.  Accordingly,  blocks of
   tissue one-half centimeter square,  taken  from  an unulcerated breast
   carcinoma, were placed in a circular glass loop filled  with argon gas
   to a pressure  of 14 millimeters, and a current of 5,000 volts applied
   for 24 hours, after which the tubes  were  placed  in  a  2-inch water
   vacuum and incubated at 37 degrees C. for 24 hours.  Using a specially
   designed 1.12 dry  lens, equal in amplitude of magnification to the 2-
   mm. apochromatic oil-immersion lens,  the  cultures  wee then examined
   under the universal   microscope,   at  a  magnification   of   10,000
   diameters, where very  much  animated, purplish-red, filterable forms,
   measuring less then one-twentieth  of  a  micron  in  dimension,  were
   observed. Carried through 14 transplants from K Medium  to  K  Medium,
   this B. X.  virus  remained constant; inoculated into 426 Albino rats,
   tumors `with all  the  true  pathology   of  neoplastic  tissue'  were
   developed. Experiments conducted   in   the  Rife  Laboratories   have
   established the fact that these characteristic diplococci are found in
   the blood monocytes in 92 percent of all cases of neoplastic diseases.
   It has also  been  demonstrated  that  the  virus  of cancer, like the
   viruses of other diseases, can be  easily  changed  from  one  form to
   another by means of altering the media upon which it  is  grown.  With
   the first change  in  media,  the  B.  X.  virus  becomes considerable
   enlarged although its purplish-red color remains unchanged.
   
   
                                   Page 6
   



Observation of the  organism  with  an  ordinary  microscope  is  made
   possible by a second alteration  of  the  media.  A  third  change  is
   undergone upon asparagus  base  media  where  the   B.   X.  virus  is
   transformed from its  filterable  state  into  cryptomyces pleomorphia
   fungi, these fungi     being    identical     morphologically     both
   microscopically to that of the orchid and of the mushroom.  And  yet a
   fourth change may   be  said  to  take  place  when  this  cryptomyces
   pleomorphia, permitted to stand as  a  stock culture for the period of
   metastasis, becomes the well-known mahogany-colored Bacillus coli.
   
        It is Dr. Rife's belief that all micro- organisms  fall into 1 of
   not more then  10  individual groups (Dr. Rosenow has stated that some
   of the viruses belong to the group of the streptococcus), and that any
   alteration of artificial  media  of   slight  metabolic  variation  in
   tissues will induce an organism of one group to change  over  into any
   other organism included   in  that  same  group,  it  being  possible,
   incidentally, to carry such such changes  in  media  or tissues to the
   point where the  organisms  fail  to  respond  to standard  laboratory
   methods of diagnosis.   These  changes can be made to take place in as
   short a period of time as 48 hours.  For  instance,  by  altering  the
   media - 4 parts per million per volume - the pure culture of mahogany-
   colored Bacillus coli  becomes  the turquoise-blue Bacillus  typhosus.
   Viruses of primordial   cells  of  organisms  which  would  ordinarily
   require an 8-week incubation period  to attain their filterable state,
   have been shown  to produce disease wi hin 3 days' time,  proving  Dr.
   Rife's contention that  the  incubation  period of a micro-organism is
   really only a cycle of reversion.
   
        He states :
   
        In reality, it is not the bacteria  themselves  that  produce the
   disease, but we  believe  it  it  the chemical constituents  of  these
   micro-organisms enacting upon  the  unbalanced  cell metabolism of the
   human body that in actuality produce  the  disease. We also believe if
   the metabolism of the human body is perfectly balanced  or  poised, it
   is susceptible to no disease.
   
        In other word, the human body itself is chemical in nature, being
   comprised of many chemical elements which provide the media upon which
   the wealth of  bacteria  normally  present  in  the human system feed.
   These bacteria are  able to reproduce.  They,  too,  are  composed  of
   chemicals.  Therefore, if  the  media upon which they  feed,  in  this
   instance the chemicals  or  some portion of the chemicals of the human
   body, become changed from the normal,  it  stands to reason that these
   same bacteria, or at least certain numbers of them,  will also undergo
   a change chemically  since  they  are now feeding upon media which are
   not normal to them, perhaps being supplied with too much or too little
   of what they need to maintain a normal existence. They change, passing
   usually through several stages of  growth,  emerging  finally  as some
   entirely new entity  -  as  different  morphologically   as   are  the
   caterpillar and the  butterfly  (to use an illustration given us). The
   majority of the  viruses  have  been  definitely  revealed  as  living
   organisms, foreign organisms it is true, but which  once  were  normal
   inhabitants of the human body -living entities of a chemical nature of
   composition.
   
        Under the universal microscope disease organisms such as those of
   tuberculosis, cancer, sarcoma, streptococcus, typhoid, staphylococcus,
   leprosy, hoof and mouth disease, and others may be observed to succumb

when exposed to  certain  lethal  frequencies,  coordinated  with  the
   particular frequencies peculiar  to   each  individual  organism,  and
   directed upon them by rays covering a wide range of waves. By means of
   a camera attachment  and a motion-picture camera not  built  into  the
   instrument, many "still"  micrographs  as  well as hundreds of feet of
   motion-picture film bear  witness  to  the  complete  life  cycles  of
   numerous organisms. It should be emphasized, perhaps,  that invariably
   the same organisms  refract  the same colors. when stained by means of
   the monochromatic beam of illumination  on  the  universal microscope,
   regardless of the  media upon which they re grown. The  virus  of  the
   Bacillus typhosus is always a turquoise blue, the Bacillus coli always
   mahogany colored, the  Mycobacterium  leprae  always a ruby shade, the
   filter-passing form of virus of tuberculosis  always an emerald green,
   the virus of cancer always a purplish red, and so on.  Thus,  with the
   aid of this microscope, it is possible to reveal the typhoid organism,
   for instance, in the blood of a suspected typhoid patient 4 and 5 days
   before a Widal is positive. When it is desired to observe the flagella
   of the typhoid-organism,  Hg  salts are used as the medium to see at a
   magnification of 10,000 diameters.
   
        In the  light  of  the  amazing   results  obtainable  with  this
   universal microscope and its smaller brother scopes,  there  can be no
   doubt of the  ability  of these instruments to actually reveal any and
   all microorganisms according  to   their   individual   structure  and
   chemical constituents.
   
        With the aid of its new eyes - the new microscopes,  all of which
   are continually being improved - science has at last penetrated beyond
   the boundary of accepted theory and into the world of the viruses with
   the result that  we can look forward to discovering new treatments and
   methods of combating the deadly organisms - for science dose not rest.

                              DISCUSSION
   
                    OBSERVATIONS WITH THE RIFE MICROSCOPE
                  OF FILTER-PASSING FORMS OF MICROORGANISMS
   
        Recently, I  reported  to  the  staff of the Mayo Clinic the more
   imported observation made during three  days,  July  5,6  and 7, 1932,
   spent in Dr.  Kendall's laboratory ar Northwestern University  Medical
   School, Chicago. I  went  there  at the invitation of Drs. Kendall and
   Rife, to share  with  them their observations  in  a  restudy  of  the
   filter-passing forms of  Eberthella  typhi as seen  with  an  improved
   model of the  Rife  microscope. They asked me also to bring with me my
   cultures of the streptococcus from poliomyelitis.
   
        I would like to repeat here that  portion  of my report which had
   to do specifically with the Rife microscope.
   
        Owing to the novel and important character of the  work,  each of
   us verified at   every   step   the   results   obtained.  Microscopic
   examinations of suitable specimens  was  made as a routine by Dr. Rife
   with his high-power microscope,by Dr. Kendall with the  oil  immersion
   dark field, and  by myself with the ordinary Zeiss microscope equipped
   with a 2 mm apochromatic oil immersion lens and 100 X 10 ocular giving
   a magnification of about 90 diameters. Most observations with the Rife
   microscope were made  at  8,000  diameters.  In  order  to  check  the
   magnification, gram and  safranin  stained  films   of   cultures   of
   Eberthella typhi, of the streptococcus from poliomyelitis, and stained
   films of blood, and of the sediment of the spinal fluid from a case of
   acute poliomyelitis were      examined.     Bacilli,     streptococci,
   erythrocytes, polymorphonuclear   leukoeytes   and   lymphocytes  were
   clearly seen, and  in  each  instance  were,  as nearly  as  could  be
   examined with the 2 mm oil immersion at about 900 diameters.
   
        The following  principles  and methods were stated by Dr. Rife as
   being essential in order to visualize  clearly the objects at this and
   higher magnifications by direct observation. Spherical  aberration  is
   reduced to the  minimum  and  magnification greatly increased by using
   objectives in place of oculars. Proper  visualization,  especially  of
   unstained objects, is  obtained  by  the  use of an  intense  beam  of
   monochromatic polarizes light  created by rotating wedge-shaped quartz
   prisms placed between the source  of  light  and  the  substage quartz
   condenser. Dispersion of the transmitted rays of light,  as  they pass
   upward to the  eye,  is  prevented by passing them through a series of
   quartz erecting (90 degrees) prisms.  Projection  of the rays of light
   through air is not greater tan 30 mm at any point.
   
        In my original report I summarized as follows:
   
        There can  be  no  question  of the existence of  the  filterable
   turquoise blue bodies  of  Eberthella-typhi described by Kendall. They
   are not visible by ordinary methods of illumination and magnification,
   not because they are too small. but  rather,  it  appears,  because of
   their peculiar non-staining  hyalin  structure.  Their   visualization
   under the Rife  microscope  is  due  to the ingenious methods employed
   rather there is to excessively high  magnification.  Examination under
   the Rife microscope of specimens, containing objects  visible with the
   ordinary microscope, leaves no doubt of the accurate visualization of
   
   
   
                                   Page 9
   



objects or particulate  matter  by direct observation at the extremely
   high magnification (calculated to  be  8,000  diameters) obtained with
   this instrument.
   
        The findings under the Rife microscope of cocci and diplococci in
   filtrated of cultures of the streptococcus from poliomyelitis,  and in
   filtrates of the   streptococcus   from   poliomyelitis,   and  herpes
   encephalitis, not detectable by the  ordinary  methods of examination.
   and which resembled  in  form and size those found in  the  respective
   cultures, and the   absence   of   minute   forms,  suggest  that  the
   filterable, inciting agent  of  these   diseases  is  not  necessarily
   extremely small, as is universally believed. Indeed,  the  filterable,
   inciting agent may  be the non-staining, highly plastic, hyaline stage
   of the visible, stainable, cultivable organism, the streptococcus.
   
        It is, of course, possible that  these unstained, invisible forms
   revealed by ordinary  methods  of  examination  are nit  the  inciting
   agents or `viruses'  of  these diseases and that they represent merely
   the filterable of other state of the streptococcus. A consideration of
   the great difficulty  one  has  in  isolating  the  streptococcus  and
   demonstrating diplococci in  lesions in these diseases  and  the  ease
   with which the  bodies are found in the filtrate indicate clearly that
   the `invisible' forms  of the streptococcus,  if  such  they  be,  are
   present in large numbers in the host, as in positive  cultures  of the
   streptococcus.  Their form,  size and color are too characteristic and
   true to type to permit considering  them  as  artifacts  or  as  being
   expressive of etiologically  unrelated,  contaminating   streptococci.
   Non- infectivity of  the  filter-passing forms, except in the cases of
   virus diseases, their presence in large  numbers in filtrates, both of
   cultures and of  infected  tissues,  and  the  great   difficulty   in
   obtaining the visible  forms  in  cultures  of filtrates indicate that
   "invisible," filter-passing forms  represent  a  certain  stage in the
   development of microorganisms.
