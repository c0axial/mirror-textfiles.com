                A PRELIMINARY STUDY OF EXTRACORPOREAL PHOTOPHERESIS
                                 FOR HIV INFECTION

          The combination   of   ultraviolet    irradiation    and   orally
       administered psoralen has been used successfully to  treat psoriasis
       and cutaneous lymphoma.

          This combination,  which  can  also  inactivate  some  viruses by
       cross-linking their DNA, has now been studied in preliminary fashion
       in patients with AIDS-related complex.

          Five HIV-infected  patients  with  lymphadenopathy  and  systemic
       symptoms underwent leukapheresis after taking 8-methoxypsoralen.

          The leukocyte-enriched  separated  fraction  of  blood  was  then
       exposed to ultraviolet A and returned to the patient.  The procedure
       was repeated twice  a  month  for  six  months,  and  patients  were
       followed for an additional nine months.

          Lymphadenopathy resolved in all  patients,  and systemic symptoms
       improved in four.

          At 15  months,  blood cultures for HIV had become negative in two
       patients.  Two completely  anergic   patients   regained   skin-test
       reactivity.

          The CD4:CD8 T-cell ratio stabilized or increased,  and antibodies
       to HIV antigens  p24 and gp120 increased in all patients.  There was
       no apparent treatment-associated toxicity.

          Given the uncontrolled and unblinded protocol, these results must
       be regarded with caution.  Nevertheless,  the  authors  believe that
       this therapy warrants further study.  -- ASB.

       Vangard notes...

          recent medical  reports  have  noted  the  use of  heat  or  high
          intensity light to destroy the HIV complex.

          We have  no  information  on  these  two techniques at this time,
          although we would greatly appreciate  anything  you might wish to
          share with our network.

          From our  limited understanding, the heat is generated  with  the
          use of microwave energy and the light is Ultraviolet.

          Another file  on  KeelyNet which indicates destruction of AIDS is
          the admixture of atomically pure  ozone  (made  with pure oxygen,
          not derived fromn the atmosphere which can generate  nitric acid)
          with blood.   The  file is OZONEAID.ASC and is listed as such and
          freely available on KeelyNet.
