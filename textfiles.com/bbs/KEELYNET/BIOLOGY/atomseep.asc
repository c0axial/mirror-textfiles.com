       The following file  possibly  accounts  for  the  plethora   of  new
       diseases and health  problems  that  seem  to have appeared over the
       past 30 years.  It follows the grave  warnings  given Walter Russell
       in his book ATOMIC SUICIDE.  A friend recently told  us of the first
       ATOMIC explosion which  occurred in San Francisco Bay at the Port of
       Chicago Naval Station!  This has been kept hidden for many years and
       the ramifications of the coverup are  still  being pursued.  We hope
       to have a file on this on KeelyNet in the near future.

                  Immune System Defects from Nuclear Bomb Testing

       In the 8 February 1992 issue of THE BRITISH MEDICAL  JOURNAL,  R. K.
       Whyte, a Canadian  pediatrician,  reports  some  disturbing evidence
       from official government sources.   Ingested  fission  products from
       nuclear weapons tests conducted in the atmosphere during  the  1950s
       had caused in  excess  of 320,000 infant deaths in the United States
       and England by 1980.

       Whyte shows that the increase in neonatal  deaths in those years can
       be explained only  by exposure to radioactive iodine  and  strontium
       injected into the  atmosphere  by  the  superpowers'  early  nuclear
       testing programmes.

       Whyte's findings validate predictions  made  in  1958  by the Soviet
       physicist Andrei Sakharov  and  cited  in  his  recently   published
       MEMOIRS.  Sakharov was   concerned,   however,  not  only  with  the
       immediate consequences of exposure  to  low-level radiation but with
       the latent effects of that radiation on the immune  system,  effects
       not considered in the Whyte paper.

       Sakharov, the most  eminent  and  authoritative nuclear scientist to
       reveal the official  misgivings about  the  health  consequences  of
       bomb-testing kept secret by all parties in the arms race, calculated

       that the tests  would  ultimately kill millions of people worldwide,
       immediately and over time.

       Sakharov's theory offers  the  first   explanation   of   the  great
       epidemiological mysteries of  our times.  The decline  in  mortality
       rates for infants and old people in the USA and the advanced Western
       European countries flattened  out  during  the  years of atmospheric
       bomb tests.  There was only a moderate  rate  of  decline  after the
       partial test-ban treaty was signed in 1963.

       In the 1980s both routing and accidental emissions from military and
       civilian reactors continued, and mortality rates  are  again  on the
       rise in the USA, UK, and France.

       According to the  UN  ANNUAL  DEMOGRAPHIC  YEARBOOK,  in  these same
       countries the death  rate  for  25-44   year  olds,  presumably  the
       healthiest and most  productive component of the labour  force,  has
       been rising since  1983  for the first time since World War II.  The
       Atlanta Center for Disease Control acknowledged this anomalous trend
       among American males.

       In the September 1990 issue of THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
       it was admitted that in states with high AIDS mortality rates, there
       are "associated" abnormal  increases   in  "other  immune  defects",
       including septicemia, pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, diseases of
       the central nervous system, heart disease, and blood disorders.

       Persons in this  age group were born between 1945  and  1965.   They
       were, therefore, most heavily exposed IN UTERO to the latent effects
       of bomb-test radiation  that  most worried Sakharov.  The consequent
       harm to their developing hormonal  and  immune  systems would emerge
       later when, as  young  adults with impaired immune  responses,  they
       would encounter the  new strains of sexually transmitted viruses and
       bacteria that Sakharov predicted would  also  result from radiation-
       induced mutation.

       Particularly after the Chernobyl disaster, we can no longer continue
       to ignore the radiation link to immune-deficiency diseases  foreseen
       by Sakharov.  Sakharov  complains that "to the best of my knowledge,
       no notice of these publications  of  mine  was  taken  in  the West,
       probably because my name was still quite unknown....Although this is
       no longer true in my case, the poor use Western journalists  make of
       their archives and reference works.....still amazes me."
