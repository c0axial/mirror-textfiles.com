                              Beet Therapy for Cancer

       One of the  most remarkable and tremendously successful programs for
       treating many different kinds of cancer  tumors was commenced in the
       late 1950's by  Alexander  Ferenczi,  MD.,  at  the  Department  for
       Internal Diseases at  the district hospital at Csoma, Hungary, using
       nothing but raw, red beets.

       Portions of his  intriguing medical  success  were  translated  from
       Hungarian and reprinted  in  the  Australian International  Clinical
       Nutrition Review for July 1986.

       Dr. Ferenczi's clinical report included methods of administering the
       beets and several very important case studies;

          In D. S., a man of 50 years of age, a lung tumor was diagnosed by
          me and  subsequently  confirmed  in  a  Budapest  hospital, which
          corresponded clinically to lung cancer....I started the treatment
          with beetroot in the described manner.

          After 6 weeks of treatment the  tumor  had  disappeared...After 4
          months of  treatment  he  gained 10kg. (22lbs.)  in  weight,  the
          erythrocyte (mature  red  blood  cell) sediment rate (e.s.r.) was
          reduced from 87 millimeters/h  to  77mm/h.   Thus, he represented
          the symptoms of a clinical recovery.

       A side-by-side comparison  of  two  cancer  patients,  one  on  beet
       therapy and the other not, further demonstrates the efficacy of this
       marvelous treatment.

          We received  simultaneously  two  patients  for  treatment.   One
          suffered from cancer of the prostate and the other from cancer of
          the uterus.  The body weight of both was the same.

          The patient  with  cancer  of   the  prostate  was  treated  with
          beetroot.  The patient with cancer of the uterus  could  not take
          it, but  remained  in our ward.  The condition of the man started
          to improve.

          When admitted, he was bedridden with a permanent catheter.  After
          one month, the catheter was removed.   The  patient walked around
          and put on weight, whereas the female patient lost weight.  After

                                      Page 1





          3 months,  there was a difference in weight of 10.5kg (23.15lbs.)
          between the two.

       Experience gained up to now points to the fact the beetroot contains
       a tumor inhibiting (anti-cancerous) active ingredient.  However, for
       the present no clue has been found  as  to the nature of this active
       substance.  One thing  is  certain,  that  it is not  very  unstable
       because it also acts when taken orally; therefore digestion does not
       harm it.

       The very apparent red color may suggest that the active substance is
       the coloring matter.    Treatment  with  beetroot  presents  several
       advantages over cancer.  Firstly,  because  it  is non-toxic and one
       can administer red beetroot in unlimited quantities.  Also there are
       unlimited supplies of beetroot at our disposal.

       We have therefore  endeavored  to  administer  to the  patient  this
       active substance in  the  most  concentrated form and in the largest
       quantities possible, because the beetroot  or rather the JUICE could
       not be given in large quantities.

       Beetroot is available to consumers in several different  forms.  One
       Lawrence, Kansas firm,   PINES  INTERNATIONAL,  makes  a  very  nice
       organic red beet root concentrate.  This beet powder is available at
       most local health food stores.

       One, however, has to be careful with the amount of beets consumed at
       any one time.  Certainly not because they're harmful, but rather due
       to their incredibly strong ability to quickly break up cancer in the
       body.

       A woman in her thirties who was treated  with  beetroot  for  breast
       cancer, contracted a  fever  of  104 degrees F., due  to  the  rapid
       breakdown of the   wastes   dumped   into   it   at  any  one  time.
       Consequently, the internal administration  of  beetroot  needs to be
       staggered out somewhat,  and closer attention given  to  DETOXIFYING
       the liver and  colon  at  the  same  time  the  beetroot  therapy is
       commenced.

       Dr. Ferenczi concluded his medical report with this undeniable fact:

          "The results achieved with beetroot  are no worse than those with
           well-known chemical  preparations, such as those  with  Tetramin
           (an experimental anti-neoplastic)."

       He attributed the anti-cancer strength in beets to their natural red
       coloring agent, BETAINE.
