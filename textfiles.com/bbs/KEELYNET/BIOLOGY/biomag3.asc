                                Magnetics - Part 1
                   The orthodox version as taught in our schools

       William Gilbert, court physician of Queen Elizabeth I, was the first
       to study magnets  from  a  scientific viewpoint.  Gilbert discovered
       that the Earth was a giant magnet by mounting a magnetized needle so
       that it could pivot freely in a vertical direction (known since as a
       "dip needle") so that the north pole  dipped toward the ground.  The
       earth was modelled by a spherical lodestone which  showed  that  the
       needle would behave exactly the same way as the earth when held over
       the "northern hemisphere", which is where Gilbert was at the time of
       his experiment.  These  researches  can  be  checked out in his work
       entitled DE MAGNETE.

       Scientists have long speculated that the Earth might have a gigantic
       iron magnet at its core.  Modern studies have shown the central core
       to be molten which discounts the magnet theory due to the phenomenon
       known as the "Curie temperature".  When iron is heated, it loses its
       strong magnetic properties.  This  occurs  at 760 degrees Centigrade
       (for iron).  The temperature at the Earth's core is CALCULATED to be
       at least 1000  degrees Centigrade indicating there  is  NO  magnetic
       field at the  core.   However,  as  the metal cools, it would become
       magnetic.

       The "Curie temperature" was discovered  by  Pierre  Curie  in  1895.
       Cobalt and nickel,  also  ferromagnetic (ferro = iron),  lose  their
       magnetic properties when  exposed  to  high temperatures.  Nickel at
       356 degrees Centigrade and Cobalt  at  1075  degrees Centigrade.  At
       low temperatures, certain    other    metals   are    ferromagnetic.
       Dysprosium becomes ferromagnetic at -188 degrees Centigrade.

       Magnetism is a  property  of the atom itself.  In most materials the
       atomic magnets are randomly oriented,  so that most of the effect is
       cancelled out.  Weak  properties  are  however  detectable  and  are
       referred to as  "paramagnetism."   The magnetic strength is referred
       to as "permeability."   Vacuum   has   a   permeability   of   1.00.
       Paramagnetic substances range between 1.00 and 1.01.

       Nickel has a permeability of 40, cobalt of 55, while  iron is in the
       thousands.  Magnetic "domains"  are  tiny  areas  about  .001  to .1
       centimeters in diameter, and are where atomic magnets line up to

                                      Page 1





       reinforce one another.   This  reinforcement  produces strong fields
       within the domains.

       In unmagnetized iron,  the  domains   are  randomly  oriented,  thus
       cancelling out one another's effect.  When the domains  are  brought
       into line by  action  of  another  magnet,  the  iron  is considered
       magnetized.

       The reorientation of domains during  the  magnetism process produces
       clicking and hissing  noises  which  can  be  detected   by   proper
       amplification.  This phenomenon  is  termed  the "Barkhausen effect"
       after the German physicist, Heinrich Barkhausen.

       In "anti-ferromagnetic substances",  such  as manganese, the domains
       also line up, but in alternate directions.  This cancels out most of
       the magnetism.  Again,  above  a particular temperature,  substances
       lose this anti-ferromagnetic   effect   and   becomes   paramagnetic
       (attractive to magnetism).

       Michael Faraday wound a coil of wire  around  a  segment  of an iron
       ring and a second coil of wire around another segment  of  the ring.
       When he connected  the  first coil to a battery, a momentary induced
       current could be  detected in the  second  coil.   The  galvanometer
       (current meter) showed  a positive increase as the magnetism  rushed
       in when the  power  was  switched on.  When the battery was switched
       off, the collapsing lines of magnetic  force  again  cut  across the
       wire of the second coil, causing a momentary surge of electricity in
       the opposite direction  of  the  first  flow.  This  was  the  first
       "transformer."

       Physicist Walter Maurice  Elsasser has proposed that the rotation of
       the earth sets up slow eddies in the molten iron core, circling west
       to east.  These eddies have the  effect  of  PRODUCING  AN  ELECTRIC
       CURRENT, also circling west to east.  Just as Faraday's coil of wire
       produced magnetic lines  of  force  within  the coil,  so  does  the
       circling electric current  in  the earth's core.  An internal magnet
       is created with a north/south axis.   This  accounts for the earth's
       magnetic field, oriented roughly along the axis of rotation, so that
       the magnetic poles are near the north and south geographic poles.

       The north magnetic  pole is off the coast of northern  Canada  about
       one thousand miles  from  the  actual  geographics  North pole.  The
       South magnetic pole is near the Antartica  shoreline  west  of  Ross
       Sea, again about one thousand miles from the geographic  South Pole.
       Interestingly enough, the  magnetic  poles are NOT DIRECTLY OPPOSITE
       EACH OTHER on the globe.  A LINE PASSING  THROUGH THEM DOES NOT PASS
       DIRECTLY THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE EARTH.

       The deviation of  the  compass  needle from the "true  North",  (the
       direction of the  geographic  North  Pole) varies irregularly as one
       travels east or west.  The compass needle shifted on Columbus' first
       voyage which he hid from his crew lest it excite terror in them that
       would force him to turn back.

       Modern physics texts teach that North Pole energy is an inflow while
       South Pole energy is an outflow.   The North pole of a magnet is the
       "north-seeking pole" of  a  bar  magnet  which  points   toward  the
       geographics North pole.

       In 1580, the  tilt or declination of the magnetic field was measured
       at 11 degrees East, 0 degrees in 1657,  25  degrees West in 1820 and
       is currently DECREASING  with  a value of about 7  degrees  West  in
       1972.

       The North end  of  a  magnet  attracts  the South end of another bar
       magnet, so we say that in magnetics,  LIKE  POLES  REPEL  AND UNLIKE
       POLES ATTRACT.  This is caused by the interaction between the moving
       and spinning orbital electrons which are bound to the nuclei.  Also,
       the radical differences  between  iron and copper  are  due  to  the
       possibility of cooperation  between  oriented  domains  in the iron.
       Therefore, ALL magnetic charges can ultimately be described in terms
       of moving charges.

       Modern efficient magnet coils use  wires  of a superconducting alloy
       (cooled below the   Curie   transition  temperature.)    A   typical
       commercially available magnet  uses  an  alloy of 75% Nb - (Niobium)
       and 25% Zr - (Zirconium) cooled to  4.2 degrees Kelvin.  Such a wire
       of only .01  inch  diameter  carries 25 Amperes with  absolutely  no
       Joule heating.

       The "Right-Hand Rule"  is  demonstrated  in the diagram on the left.
       If you picture your right hand grasping  the  shaft  with  the thumb
       pointing up, the positive current will be flowing in  the  direction
       of your thumb.  (SEE BIOMAG3.GIF)

       The fingers of  your right hand would then indicate the direction of
       the magnetic lines of force which  will  be CCW if looking DOWN ONTO
       the elliptical flux lines.

       Modern magnetics teaches that the lines of magnetic  flux enter from
       the North Pole  and  exit  from the South Pole.  These lines bow out
       into space from the RADIATING SOUTH  POLE  to  rejoin the CONDENSING
       NORTH POLE.

       There are theories which posit the existence of a MAGNETIC MONOPOLE.
       This would be a magnetic mass with ONLY A SOUTH POLE OR ONLY A NORTH
       POLE.  This postulated  phenomenon  has  yet to be  witnessed  under
       laboratory conditions although  there  have been reports in isolated
       instances.  (over the past few years, we received a copy of a patent
       showing a configuration of magnets  which  form  a  SINGLE monopole,
       either north or south depending on the orientation  of the 6 magnets
       which comprise the  structure,  they  are  arranged in an X,Y,Z axis
       with a common pole pointing toward the center)

       In the next  issue of the PLENUM,  we  will  go  into  the  research
       findings of Albert Roy Davis and Walter Rawls.  Here  we  will being
       to see a  potential conflict when attempting to define spin as CW or
       CCW.  It is entirely dependent on the PERSPECTIVE OF THE VIEWER.
