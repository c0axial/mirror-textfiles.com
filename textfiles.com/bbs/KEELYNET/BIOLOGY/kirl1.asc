                            KIRLIAN PHOTOGRAPHY

    What is Kirlian  photography?    What does it mean?   What promise
    does it hold for the future?   Many  are  familiar with what these
    pictures look like, but still have unanswered questions.

                   THE KIRLIAN EFFECT....ITS BEGINNINGS

    The process of  Kirlian  photography  was discovered  in  1939  by
    Semyon Kirlian, a  Russian  electronic technician, after ten years
    in research and development of this process.   Kirlian photography
    was not investigated  in  the  United  States  until  the  1970's.
    Thelma Moss, a UCLA psychologist, pioneered the technique  in  the
    United States.

    Dr. V.M. Inyushin,  a  Soviet biologist at the State University at
    Kazakhastan who has studied the Kirlian  process,  states that the
    bioluminescence revealed in  these  photographs is  BIOPLASMA,  an
    energy body similar to the aura or astral body as defined in Yogic
    literature.   Iyushin further believes that this bioplasmic energy
    body reflects both  the psychological and physical health of human
    beings.

    Kirlian photography is in its infancy,  so there are many theories
    and speculations regarding    interpretation.      However,    the
    photographic images are  REAL,  and offer tangible evidence of the
    pulsating charge and discharge of life's energies (vibrations).

                      COLORS AND KIRLIAN PHOTOGRAPHY

    Researchers have demonstrated that there is important meaning
    in the various colors captured in  Kirlian  photographs.  Findings
    suggest that normal, healthy human subjects emanate  "bluish-white
    coronal colors" that  are  clearly  delineated.    Additionally, a
    deep blue band, symmetrical in pattern  and  one-sixteenth to one-
    quarter inch wide, appears just beyond the outer  boundary  of the
    fingertips.

    In persons who   reported  feeling  tense,  aroused,  anxious,  or
    emotionally excited the pattern  is  different.    A  red color is
    distinct and appears as a luminous red cloud or blotch  just above
    the fingertips.   These Kirlian photographs of emotionally excited
    subjects produced images with boundaries that consistently seem to
    dissolve.

    One of the  most  controversial aspects of Kirlian research is the
    "phantom leaf effect",  where intact  images  of  an  entire  leaf
    appear after parts of the leaf have been cut away.    This  effect
    implies that the   bioplasmic  energy  body  (aura)  exists  in  a
    separate reality which extends beyond  the  ordinary  concepts  of
    space and time.








                              A FINAL THOUGHT

    The colorful Kirlian aura reflects the complex relationship of the
    frequencies of energy emitted by both the subject photographed and
    the field generated  by the Kirlian apparatus.   Yet, to determine
    the meaning of these vivid colors,  even  at  this early stage, we
    cannot rely entirely on our rational-intellectual  and  analytical
    abilities.

    We must, instead,  balance  these  intellectual  talents  with our
    intuitive sensing.   In the vast  realm  of  the human mind, there
    are seemingly no limits....but Kirlian photography will extend the
    limits of our experiments and our experience.
