                         Why are Negative Ions So Healthy?

       Lenard (1915) found that when water is atomized (e.g. on impact of a
       water droplet), negative and positive charges are SEPARATED.

       Molecules which are  torn  from  the  surface  of  the  water bear a
       NEGATIVE charge (small negative ions)  whereas  large  drops  or the
       entire mass of water are POSITIVE.

       This provided an   unexpected   explanation   for  the   refreshing,
       invigorating effect of residences close to a waterfall or spring, or
       even after rain.

       Some of these  reactions  which  IMPROVE WELL-BEING and physical and
       mental capacity have since become known.

         1)  Negative  ions  ACCELERATE   the   OXIDATIVE   DEGRADATION  of
             serotonin whereas POSITIVE ions have the opposite  action  and
             INACTIVATE the ENZYMES which BREAK DOWN SEROTONIN.

         2)  An  INCREASE  in  the  serotonin  level  (5-hydroxytryptamine)
             PRODUCES

                a)  tachycardia,
                b)  a rise in blood pressure,
                c)  bronchospasm going as far as ASTHMA ATTACK,
                d)  increased  INTESTINAL   PERISTALSIS  (contractions  and
                    dilations of  the  intestines  to  move   the  contents
                    onwards),
                e)  increased SENSITIVITY to pain,
                f)  increased AGGRESSION.

         3)  A  DECREASE  in  the  serotonin level is CALMING and INCREASES
             DEFENSES AGAINST INFECTION  (as  proven  with  influenza  'the
             flu').

         4)  Negative   ions   produce  an  INCREASE  in  hemoglobin/oxygen
             affinity so that the partial  oxygen  pressure  in  the  blood
             rises but the partial carbon dioxide pressure DECREASES.

             This results  in  REDUCED  RESPIRATORY RATE and  ENHANCES  the
             METABOLISM of water-soluble vitamins.

       In addition, negative  ions  produce  an  INCREASE  in  PH  and,  in
       particular, an INCREASE in the SECRETORY  performance  of the MUCOSA
       with an INCREASE in CILIARY MOVEMENT in the airways.

       According to the  studies  of  Fleischer and Pantlitschko,  negative
       ions probably also  IMPROVE  BLOOD FLOW by increasing the release of
       proteolytic enzymes with fibrinolytic activity.

       Wordens studied the adrenals of golden  hamsters kept under the same
       experimental conditions.  The  adrenals  of  animals   treated  with
       POSITIVE ions weighed  33% LESS than the adrenals of animals treated
       with normal respiratory air.

       On the other hand, the weight of the  adrenals  from golden hamsters
       treated with NEGATIVE ions was 29% HIGHER.

       Olivereau found a 30% ENLARGEMENT of adrenals in rats  after 20 days
       of treatment with  NEGATIVE  ions.   This  finding suggests that the
       ability of the adrenals to produce  glucocorticoids  is  REDUCED  by
       POSITIVE ions and INCREASED by NEGATIVE ions.

       Considerable INCREASE in  VITAL  CAPACITY  were  observed   by  M.A.
       Vytchikova and A. Minkh in 1959, with the maintenance of blood sugar
       and blood oxygen levels.

       Thus, in a  group  of  9 sports students, Minkh found that ergometer
       endurance was INCREASED by 260% in  32  days  compared with a normal
       control group following the INHALATION for 15 minutes  DAILY  of air
       enriched with 1.5 million NEGATIVE small ions per centimeter.

       Even before the  1976  Olympics,  air  ionization  in  the  sleeping
       quarters of team members was used  to  improve performance in sports
       centres in the USSR and the GDR [M. Jokl, Prague].

       Studies by Altmann  in  1975  clearly show that the  performance  of
       school children can,  for  example,  be  CONSIDERABLY  INCREASED  by
       changing the electrical conditions of the rooms.  Comparable effects
       have also been achieved by the use of IONIZED AIR.

       According to the  latest information  in  the  fields  of  medicine,
       biology and meteorology,  it  can  be definitively established  that
       atmospheric ions have a biological effect.

       Atmospheric electrical factors  are  a  component of our environment
       and we humans are clearly affected by ELECTRO-IONIC MICROCLIMATES to
       a far greater extent than previously imagined.

       This finding acquires particular significance  since, as a result of
       artificial air conditioning (e.g. atmospheric pollution,  buildings,
       air-conditioning units, heating,      electrical      installations,
       plastics), civilized man  spends   50-100%   of   his   time  in  an
       UNNATURALLY CHARGED ELECTROCLIMATE.

       In cities, in  closed  rooms  and  in  cars, etc., the proportion of
       small negative ions in the atmosphere  is  markedly reduced compared
       with undisturbed nature.

       An atmosphere with  an EXCESS of NEGATIVE ions, such  as  frequently
       arise under open  sky,  usually  INDUCES a complete VEGETATIVE TURN-
       AROUND within twenty days.

       In the curative  phase  of this total  turn-around,  the  vegetative
       nervous system is  normally  RESTORED and the course  of  infectious
       diseases is essentially   ATTENUATED  (weakened)  and  (healing  is)
       ACCELERATED.

       Vangard notes...

            The information in this paper  provides  more  than  sufficient
            evidence that  negative  ion  generators can  only  be  a  good
            investment.  The small decorative water fountains which cascade
            or spray  are not only visually appealing, but also provide the
            pleasing sound of moving water.   Now  with  the explanation of
            the negative charge from the rupturing of the  water  molecule,
            we can  see  how  the  atomizing  process is a highly desirable
            effect to bring about.

            Many of the electronics magazines  have  ads  in  the  back for
            companies which  sell  surplus.   We  have seen  small  plastic
            impeller pumps  which  could easily be built into a fountain or
            waterfall.  The cost is minimal,  something  on the order of $5
            to $25  for  the  pump,  plastic,  plaster of paris,  concrete,
            fiberglass or earth all can be used to build the fountain.

            A very  neat  and  healthful  project, in fact, something which
            could make money for all you  entrepeneurs.   Many people would
            buy such devices if they were available for a reasonable price.

            One in the bedroom, where face it, we spend  at  least  6 hours
            per day,  one in the living room or den, where we spend up to 4
            hours or more per day.  There are lots of possibilites.

            For that matter, the atomizer  does  not have to be decorative,
            just a  way  to moisturize the air with the negatively  ionized
            droplets.  Incidentally,   most   modern  cooling  systems  use
            refrigerated air   which   means   the   air   is   essentially
            recirculated and the majority of the moisture is REMOVED.

                         Have fun and good health to you!
