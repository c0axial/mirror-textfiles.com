                                Dr. Badgley on AIDS

                                   INTRODUCTION

            It appears that "AIDS" has become very big business.  The fear,
       the thought of  "AIDS"  produces  in  individuals is enough to cause
       some people to pretend it does not  exist.  What the public is being
       told about "AIDS" by the major media is making sure that it has this
       effect.  For  some time now I have been following the  "AIDS"  story
       and I am  not  surprised  to see that the people fighting the war on
       cancer are now fighting a new war.

            The mystery  of  "AIDS" has given  medical  researchers  a  new
       opportunity with which to bleed the American tax payer  of  precious
       research dollars.  I am not suggesting that we do not need solutions
       to the "AIDS" puzzle, but like the war on cancer, those that receive
       the research dollars  are selected by special interest groups in the
       medical and pharmaceutical community  has  approved your research as
       being valid and worthy of financial support.

            If ones research proposal fails to mention Dr.  Gallo  and  the
       HIV virus one could forget about receiving any part of the financial
       resources available for  research.   It appears that the bottom line
       in "AIDS" research is money, not the  money that is to be spent, but
       rather the money   that   will   be  made.  Imagine   how   much   a
       pharmaceutical company has  to  gain  if  they  own the patent on an
       effective drug to combat "AIDS".   Never  mind  an effective drug, a
       dangerous and suspect drug, like AZT will do.  Burrows-Wellcome  has
       made a substantial amount of money from the marketing of AZT, a drug
       that for some is so toxic that it is useless.

            The purpose for this paper is to disseminate information that I
       feel is being  suppressed by the main stream media, why this is so I
       can only guess at.  It seems that if you are not satisfied with what
       you are being told causes "AIDS"  then  you  can't  be serious about
       finding a solution to the problem.  The fact remains that no one can
       say unequivocally what causes "AIDS".  As of this date,  there still
       is no evidence  to  support  the  contention  that  the HIV virus is
       responsible for causing "AIDS".  How often is this fact mentioned in
       the main stream media.  How often  is  it mentioned or stressed that
       "AIDS" is not  a  disease,  but  rather  a  syndrome.    That   what
       ultimately puts an  individual  in the hospital is not a new disease
       but rather any number of diseases that have been around for ages.
       Why is it that the vital factor that  results  in  mortality  in all
       "AIDS" cases is  an  immune  system that has been compromised.   The
       course of treatment  is  to  aggressively  treat the individual with
       powerful drugs that  further  compromise   the  individuals  defense
       system.  I asked a physician friend of mine, what is the rational

                                      Page 1





       for this?  The good doctor says that, all though this is true, there
       is a philosophy  in medicine that says, when determining a course of
       treatment the physician must weigh the benefit of the treatment with
       the potential negative effects and  if  the  benefits  outweigh  the
       drawbacks the physician should go ahead with the treatment.

            In 1981 when the so called "AIDS" epidemic was  starting to get
       attention, the co-factor  theory  of cause was in the forefront.  As
       is often the case, the one disease  one  germ model took precedence.
       With the discovery, by Dr. Robert Gallo, of the HTLV-III  virus  the
       search for a solution was confined to finding a weapon to combat the
       alleged culprit.  Little  mention  is  made  in the general media of
       alternate avenues of  research,   and   for  some  reason  promising
       alternatives for combating this scourge are being ignored.  It seems
       clear that because  many  of  these  alternatives   implement   non-
       patentable remedies, and  therefore  no  money  can  be made, no one
       seems interested.

            What follows are excerpts from  a five hour "AIDS" special that
       aired on October  6,  1987  over  WBAI  radio in New  York  City,  a
       listener supported, non-commercial  FM  station operated by Pacifica
       Radio. The person who is responsible  for this wealth of information
       is Gary Noll.  I have tried to limit myself to the participants  own
       words and paraphrased  as  accurately  as possible.  When references
       are referred to, I have sought to properly document the reference.

       Gary:

       Our next guest is Dr. Laurence Badgley. Welcome to our program
       Doctor.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Dr. Badgley:

       Thank you Gary.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Gary:

       First, you have taken somewhat of  a  different  approach than other
       people in the field. The traditional physician has  used  very toxic
       immunosuppressant drugs in order to try to help the person with AIDS
       and even the  desire  and  the  intent  is  certainly  admirable the
       effects sometimes are as deadly as the disease process itself.

       From the alternative perspective  would  you  share with us what you
       see, first, the larger overview is the basic wrong headedness in the
       approach to treating  AIDS  and then more specifically  what  you're
       doing and the results.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Dr. Badgley:

       Truly what we're  seeing  at the present time is that the people who
       led the war on cancer, the failed  war  on  cancer,  have  now  been
       transferred over to lead the war on AIDS, with the  same  technology
       that did not work for cancer.

                                      Page 2





       Natural therapies on  the  other hand have a long time tested period
       in the field  of  medicine,  thousands  of  years  in  the  oriental
       traditions.

       What we do in the clinics in California with natural therapies for
       AIDS is that  we  use  a total program of nutrition  [and]  the  low
       intensity energies that balance the body, that stimulate the body to
       heal itself. I think that's one of the tenets of natural therapies.

       We have to  realize  we're  not talking about a cure, but rather the
       body heals itself when you give it  the  right energy, the right raw
       materials for immune  system  function,  so that we  use  nutrition,
       vitamins, minerals, herbs    to   stimulate   the   immune   system,
       acupuncture which has scientifically  been demonstrated to boost the
       immune system, and we bring in the mental therapies,  what  we might
       call relaxation medicines,   these  are  the  low  tech  high  touch
       therapies of self  hypnosis,  biofeedback,   imagery,  visualization
       because we know that the human mind has profound influence on immune
       system function form  moment to moment. What we're  seeing  is  that
       people who use  these  natural  therapies  are  able to increase the
       qualities of their lives are able  to  go  back  to  work,  be fully
       functional.

       Some of our people had Kaposi Sarcoma far in excess of the usual two
       years, they're doing  well  they  have  normal  helper  cell/T  cell
       counts. So that I think natural therapies have a wealth of knowledge
       and opportunity for people with immune system diseases.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Gary:

       Can you give  us  what  you've found is the most effective treatment
       for AIDS, and possibly give us some  of  the  actual case histories,
       the dates and the circumstances so that we can see a little bit more
       clearly and a little more objectively what your therapy consists of.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Dr. Badgley:

       Gary I have  to  tell you it's not one secret magic  bullet  natural
       therapy involved here  it's  a  total  program. Many people make the
       mistake when they start thinking  about  going  towards  alternative
       therapies are going to find the magic herb, the magic  vitamin  dose
       and so forth,  we  don't  have that, what we have is a total program
       that involves dealing with the mind  physical  body  and the spirit.
       What our AIDS patients tell us, the survivors, the  people  who  are
       doing well, who've  beat  the  odds  by far, what their programs and
       their lives have  indicated  to  us  with  their  natural  therapies
       approach is that they take charge of their lives,  I  think  this is
       the critical aspect, of the survivor program.

       People have made  the  decision  to  live  and taken charge of their
       lives and put in place a program that's  custom  made for themselves
       that has something from the different areas. It's often  based  upon
       natural nutrition, live  foods,  organic  foods, vegetarianism, they
       take large amounts of vitamins, minerals herbs and so forth.

       Some of the survivors, to give you a case example, one fellow, who
       is typical, who was bedridden for  many months in the early eighties
       with the ravages of this disease process, he made  the  decision  to
       live, put himself on a natural foods program undertook changes in

                                      Page 3





       his mental attitude so that he realized an attudinal shift to change
       his perceptions about his disease process put in place a very strong
       will to live,  used  high  amounts  of various vitamins and minerals
       that are commonly  used  by  natural   therapist   and   nutritional
       therapist took a  variety  of  medicinal  herbs  from   the  Chinese
       tradition, underwent acupuncture  once  weekly, and his T-cell count
       now is over 300 in this course of time over the last four or five
       years it would have ordinarily been markedly lower than that in fact
       he would not be alive if he were  to  have  followed the traditional
       course of the evolution of the disease process.

       I think the  natural  therapies  like  this  have   made  a  decided
       difference in many  of  these  patients,  Another  patient  has  had
       Karposi Sarcoma in excess of two years,  his helper cell count is in
       the normal range,  his  T-4/T-8  ratio is normal his  been  doing  a
       program like the  one  I  described, a little different mix of those
       items, but essentially the basic three  areas have been covered, the
       body the mind and the spirit.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Gary:

       As a preventive guide for people in the audience, what measures
       would you suggest for them?
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Dr. Badgley:

       I would say that for people who have ARC or AIDS, one thing
       that they need to do is realize the myth that this is caused by
       one virus, the HIV virus, by understanding the myth then you
       can begin understanding why the natural therapies, the low tech
       therapies might work.

       You see the germ theory has held sway over the last  hundred  years,
       and the high  tech approach in medicine has been an attempt to apply
       itself to that type of a theory where  there  is  one cause for each
       disease.

       Rather, in AIDS, I think what we have, and  what the survivors are
       teaching us, is that it's a disease that's a result of many co-
       factors.

       We used to here about co-factors in this disease process  until this
       HIV virus was  discovered and then the co-factor concept fell by the
       wayside, but indeed we see that people  who  develop  AIDS  had many
       things happen in their lives that become cumulatively  the  cause of
       the disease process, many past infections, lots of syphilis, lots of
       gonorrhea, many courses  of  antibiotics throughout their life time,
       improper nutrition, poor self esteem, anger, fear and panic.

       And when people learn that they have  AIDS since the media distorted
       this picture so greatly the average person is led to believe, by the
       authorities, the medical authorities, they have this  fatal  disease
       [that] they self program for death.

       Rather, the stories  that  the  survivors teach us is that they have
       not bought into that model. They have realized the co-factor nature
       of this disease process, and they have done things in their lives to
       correct these co-factor situations.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

                                      Page 4




       Gary:

       Do you find that the average healthy heterosexual, either black
       or white or Puerto Rican or any other nationality, is at risk
       of AIDS?
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Dr. Badgley:

       I don't think that the risk is as great as the media makes it
       out to be. It seems to be confined to populations of people who
       perhaps are involved in lifestyles and habits that are not in
       keeping with the balance of nature.

       If you look   at   the  situation  of  wives  who  have  unprotected
       intercourse with people who have  positive  antibody  blood picture.
       Many cases, cases that I have seen in my office amongst my patients,
       these wives have not converted to becoming antibody positive.

       If you take  the  cases  of  people  who have had accidental  needle
       sticks, it's clear  that  the  virulence  of this virus is much less
       than hepatitis.

       The virus is,  apparently  according  to  scientific  investigation,
       lives for two  weeks  outside the human body. The virus  is  clearly
       widely prevalent in  the  community  and  not  that many people have
       developed AIDS.

       If you look at the figures themselves  only one in every one hundred
       people who are  antibody positive have developed AIDS.  The  figures
       clearly demonstrate that this is not a virulent, easily transmitted
       disease.

       The stories of  the  people who have AIDS have impressed me with the
       fact that they  have done things  in  their  lives  that  have  been
       decidedly injurious to their immune systems, and  I  think  a strong
       case ca n  be  made that people who have developed AIDS have injured
       their immune systems first, that  the  HIV  virus and the other many
       germs that come  into the body at that point are secondary  invaders
       taking advantage of a week terrain, sort of speak.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Gary:

       I have a few thoughts I'd like you to respond to if you would
       please. Almost nowhere are we hearing the importance of
       stimulating the bodies natural immune response, but rather
       we're told that only a drug can stimulate that response, and
       generally those drugs don't work that well in co-operation with
       the bodies immune system, and if they do, they may stimulate
       one aspect of the immune system and at the same time suppress
       another aspect of the immune system.

       What do you see is being the critical point where the body can fight
       for itself? What  exactly  does it need, and in what measure does it
       need it, just  to  get a little clearer,  a  little  better  focused
       insight?
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Dr. Badgley:

       Well we're not  hearing  about  the natural therapies  because  they
       don't fit into the economic scheme of things in medicine.

                                      Page 5





       Clearly the types of therapies I'm talking about are low on the
       scales of economies. They don't require much money and they
       are not patentable so they don't make for lucrative business
       types of situations.

       The type of  things  we're  talking about are in the use of vitamins
       and minerals for example. It has been clearly demonstrated that AIDS
       patients are deficient in certain  critical  minerals  that  are  so
       important for immune  system  function,  the  raw material  for  the
       immune system. Be  aware that we make about five million white blood
       cells every few minutes.

       These are the forge fighters of the  immune  system, and if we don't
       put into our bodies the correct raw materials we don't  have  a good
       strong immune system.

       We're talking about  such  things  as  selenium,  iron,  zinc, beta-
       carotene becomes very important, vitamin  A,  vitamin C becomes very
       important.

       It's a whole range of vitamins and minerals that  are  so  important
       and so lacking in the average population. The average American diet
       has been analyzed  in  the  laboratory to find out how much vitamins
       and minerals it  contains.  And low  and  behold,  there  are  broad
       segments of our   population   who   are   malnourished   from   the
       [standpoint] of vitamins and minerals.

       It has been  demonstrated  that there are significant percentages of
       our population who  do  not  obtain   even   the  recommended  daily
       allowance of vitamins and minerals. This is a shame,  it's  part  of
       the problem.

       When we speak  about using nutrition for such a serious disease many
       people regard it to be a laughable matter, but I think the point is
       that it's so simple that it is over looked.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Gary:

       Let me run down some specific nutrients, and give us, if you
       would, what you feel is the relationship of that nutrient and
       the immune system. Lets start with some of the herbs, virtually
       unused at all in traditional medicine in the context of AIDS.

       Let us start with some of the oriental medicines, such as
       Chinese medicinal herbs.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Dr. Badgley:

       Well, the herbs have been demonstrated,  in the laboratory, to boost
       the immune system  function,  and  the  way  they   do  this  is  by
       increasing out put of hormones which are the messengers by which the
       immune system works.

       We've all heard of interferon and interluken II and every few months
       or every years  or  so we have a new natural substance from the body
       which that is being touted as a dramatic  break  through in the cure
       for cancer.

       The reason that these things don't pan out is that the allopathic

                                      Page 6





       physicians tend to take these powerful hormones chemicals and inject
       them back into body as drugs.

       I think that the way herbs work, rather, is to stimulate the body to
       do it's own thing.

       And it's been  demonstrated that certain Chinese medicinal mushrooms
       can stimulate the body to out put  it's  own  intefuron  at it's own
       level, it's own  high  tide,  it's  own  low  tide,  with  it's  own
       pulsation that changes  cyclically  from  moment  to moment, hour to
       hour through out the day.

       This is important because if you stimulate  the  body to do it's own
       thing, it is closer to finding its own balance, and when you put in,
       even substances that are natural to the body, you can overide this
       balance, this delicate balance, that the body has of its own wisdom.

       Chinese medicinal herbs have been shown to increase white blood cell
       numbers, and antibody production. Chinese medicinal  mushrooms are a
       particular interest of  mine  and  I  have  used them with some AIDS
       patients with interesting results.

       Herbs are natural  gentle ways to  stimulate  the  body  to  balance
       itself, and the  oriental  tradition  of  thousands   of  years  has
       demonstrated this to  us. Certain vitamins, herbs and mushrooms have
       been shown to provide longevity have been used medicinally.

       Echinasia is another herbs that's been widely studied in Europe, was
       used in the United States until the  late eighteen hundreds when the
       American Medical Association  criticized its use,  but  in  Germany,
       very good analytic   laboratory   science  has  demonstrated  simian
       potentiating function. It's  an herb  I  often  recommend  for  AIDS
       patients.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Gary:

       How about herbs such as garlic and licorice and even non-herbs
       such as wheatgrass and some of the micro-algies that have been
       shown, like spirolenena  and chlorella, to make an  impact  on  deep
       cell cleansing and  detoxification  because  we haven't heard of any
       programs being offered that first  detoxifies  the  person with AIDS
       and then to  rebuild  their  health  properly  with  natural  immune
       stimulators.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Dr. Badgley:

       Yes, many of the foods could be potential potent immune stimulators.
       Garlic is one,  it's  been  used  widely throughout the ages in many
       different cultures.

       When diluted many  thousands   of   times   in   water   still   has
       antibacterial, antifungal functions. The algae world  is  presenting
       us with a new class of compounds that look very interesting.

       There is work  being  done  currently  at  Harvard University in the
       department of dentistry and oral  pathology  with  oral  cancers.  A
       substance has been  taken  from  algae  which is a  mixture  of  the
       pigments of the algae. There are about fifteen different pigments in
       this mixture. These are the pigments that give the algae the color,

                                      Page 7





       and the pigments the algae uses to make energy to protect itself
       from excessive sunlight,  and  also  to  use sunlight to manufacture
       energy.

       These pigments have  been  demonstrated   to   increase  the  cancer
       surveillance system of the body. Be advised that one  third  of AIDS
       patients die of Karposi Sarcoma which is a skin cancer.

       For the first   time  in  history  the  scientist  at  Harvard  have
       demonstrated that the body indeed  has a cancer surveillance system,
       that these pigments can, under the microscope, increase  such things
       as tumornocroses factor  alpha  which  is  a  hormone--one  of these
       hormones they've been  talking about  from  macrophage  white  blood
       cells--that necroses or  kills  cancer  cells,  directly  visualized
       under the microscope.

       In the same experiment the experimenters have discovered that this
       mixture of pigments  increases  the  cytotoxic  T-cells around these
       incipient cancer cells that are developing.  The  cytotoxic T-cells,
       the T-H cells are the cells the body that attack  other  cells  that
       harbor viruses, it's the cell group that increases in AIDS patients,
       early on, in  an  attempt  to  scavenge up the cells that harbor the
       virus, again, directly visualized under the microscope.

       This landmark research shows that  we  do have a cancer surveillance
       system that can  be  activated by natural products,  food  products,
       nutrient products.  And  it's  a  very  exciting area of medicine, I
       hope that we have the freedom of  investigation  in  this country to
       allow these sorts  of ideas to be further used and investigated  and
       used in AIDS  patients  before it becomes tied up into a monopoly as
       was done with cancer.

       In my own state, I have to tell you,  there  are  laws  on the books
       that prohibits the types of methods we're talking  about  here  from
       being used with cancer patients.

       It's against the  law.  If I were to use them with cancer patients I
       could have my license taken away.

       Gary:

       Could you give us what you would  see  as  the Candida connection to
       AIDS and also  more specifics on some of the vitamins  and  minerals
       you feel would make a difference.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Dr. Badgley:

       Gary I have to tell you that the Candida connection is there. Indeed
       most of the  AIDS  patients  we  see  seem  to  have  a problem with
       candida.

       Early on when AIDS was first discovered,  all  the  patients  it was
       discovered in were found to have candida. I think it might be one of
       the co-factors.

       It's certainly an   organism  that  is  widely  prevalent   in   the
       environment, and comes  into  the body when the body when the immune
       system is weakened.


                                      Page 8





       I do have  to  counter  that  with  the observation though that many
       times in the alternative natural therapies communities there is a
       similar approach to  the  disease   process  that  we  find  in  the
       allopathic community, that is to say the one germ one disease model,
       and I think  that  perhaps  we've  entered  a  phase   of   to  much
       concentration on the germ candida as the cause of things.

       It's a friendly   germ,  it  lives  in  every  ones  body,  just  as
       pneumocyctis pneumonia does. It gets  out  of  bounds  when the body
       terrain, the body  itself is weakened so we need to  strengthen  the
       body, we need  to  strengthen  the  terrain,  and that's the guiding
       principle of natural therapies.

       So that we use, vitamin B-6, we use magnesium, we use manganese,
       malithinum, copper, zinc, iron, many of these patients seem to
       be deficient in iron. We use these  in  good  amounts that will help
       provide the immune system with the raw materials it needs
       in order to bring itself into balance.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Gary:

       What about specific vitamins and minerals?
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Dr. Badgley:

       Vitamin A becomes very important, folic acid, I'm sort  of  hesitant
       to talk about  levels of vitamin use, because I think that these are
       things that need to be done between  client/patient and their health
       practitioner.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Gary:

       That I agree with, but at least to give them an indication  of which
       nutrients have been shown to stimulate the immune system.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Dr. Badgley:

       Well, the ones  I  have  already  mentioned  so far are the critical
       ones, the ones  that  have been widely  demonstrated  to  boost  the
       immune system.

       Others are quarsathine  and Co-enzyme-Q which are  not  specifically
       vitamins might be brought into the picture.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Gary:

       I want to  thank  you very much for sharing these insights.  Clearly
       it is an  alternative  approach  or  even   concomitant  with  other
       therapies.

       It's only to the patients advantage to stimulate the  immune  system
       by using the  least  invasive  and  the  least toxic method, and the
       information you provided us with is heading us in that direction.
