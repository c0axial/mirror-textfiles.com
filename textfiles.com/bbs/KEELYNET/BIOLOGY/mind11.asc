                              The Quantum Zeno Effect

       Title->     Can't get there from here; quantum physics puts a new
                   twist on Zeno's paradox.

       Authors->   Powell, Corey S.

       Can't Get There from Here

       Two thousand years  ago  the  Greek  philosopher  Zeno noted that an
       object moving from one place to another  must  first reach a halfway
       point, and before that a point half of the way to the halfway point,
       and so on.

       Any movement involves an infinite number of intermediate points, and
       so any motion must require an infinite amount of time.  Motion, Zeno
       concluded, is logically impossible.

       In fact, things  do  move.  Zeno did not consider  that  an  endless
       series could have  a finite sum.  But in the counter-intuitive realm
       of quantum physics, something akin to Zeno's paradox can occur:

                atoms can be paralyzed if they are closely scrutinized.

       The act of observing prevents the  atom from passing a halfway point
       between two energy levels.

       In 1977 E.  C.  George  Sudarshan  and  Baidyanath   Misra   of  the
       University of Texas at Austin realized that an unstable object, such
       as a radioactive  atom,  WOULD  NEVER  DECAY  if  it  were  observed
       continuously.  They called this surprising  phenomenon  the  quantum
       Zeno effect.

       Now Wayne M. Itano and his colleagues at the National Institute of
       Standards and Technology  (NIST)  have observed a  variant  of  this
       effect in the real world.  Their work will appear in Physical Review
       A.

       The reason for the Zeno effect lies at the heart of quantum physics,
       which states that the energy of an atom moving between two energy
       states is somewhat uncertain and that (for short intervals) the
       uncertainty grows over time.
                                      Page 1





       For an atom  to  shift  from one state to the other, the uncertainty
       must be large  enough  to  bridge   the  two.   A  measurement  that
       determines the atom's energy "collapses" the atom  to  the  measured
       state.

       Afterward the uncertainty  grows again, but it should be possible to
       "freeze" an atom  in  one energy state  BY  TAKING  MEASUREMENTS  SO
       FREQUENTLY that its energy NEVER BECOMES UNCERTAIN  ENOUGH TO LET IT
       JUMP TO ANOTHER STATE.

       To observe the Zeno effect, the NIST team confined 5,000 beryllium
       ions in an   electromagnetic   trap   and   exposed   them  for  256
       milliseconds to a radio frequency  that  bumps  beryllium  ions to a
       higher, excited energy state.

       During the test they fired short, 2.4-millisecond  laser  pulses  at
       the ions to  determine their energy state.  Ions in the bottom state
       scattered the light pulse back; those  in the excited state did not.
       Each measurement pulse returned a scatter proportional to the number
       of ions still in the bottom energy state.

       When a single  measurement pulse was sent at the end  of  the  test,
       nearly all the  ions  were  found  to be in the higher state, as one
       might expect.  More frequent laser  pulses caused the number of ions
       in the higher energy state to decrease.

       When 64 pulses--the largest number used--were sent, essentially none
       of the atoms was able to jump to the higher level.   The measurement
       pulses occurred so  often  that  THERE  WAS  NO  TIME for each ion's
       uncertainty TO BECOME LARGE ENOUGH  TO  PERMIT IT TO REACH THE UPPER
       LEVEL.

       The NIST experiment sheds some interesting light on the question of
       the role of the observer in a system like this.  The scattered laser
       light, used to  determine  the  energy  states  of  the  atoms,  was
       observed after the end of the 256-millisecond test period.

       The energy states  of  the  ions, however, collapsed when hit by the
       pulses during the  test  period, before  the  return  scatters  were
       actually observed.

       Despite the apparent link between the viewer and the behavior of the
       ions, IT WAS THE ACT OF MEASUREMENT -- not the act of observing the
       measurement -- that immobilized the ions.

       Even so, the experiment may strengthen the conviction  of  those who
       believe the old adage: "A watched pot never boils."

       Vangard Note...

           A most  fascinating observation.  As a point of interest, in the
           early part of the 20th century,  two  well  known psychics did a
           study of   the  elements  in  an  attempt  to  ascertain   their
           structure.

           The psychics were C. W. Leadbeater and Annie Besant.  From their
           efforts, a book was written with descriptions of what they


                                      Page 2





           found.  That  book  is  "OCCULT CHEMISTRY" and is available from
           Health Research (listed in the CONTACT file on KeelyNet).

           Besant and Leadbeater described  their  attempts  to "look" into
           matter using  their psychic abilities.  In the  first  attempts,
           they managed  to  see  down into the structure but the particles
           were moving at such rapid speeds  that no pattern could be seen,
           simply a blur of moving bodies.

           Something inspired them to think that a psychic "clamp" could be
           effected which would temporarily FREEZE THE MOVING  PARTICLES to
           allow the structure to be seen.

           This technique  was tried and found to be successful.  The clamp
           could only be sustained for seconds  but  it  was  sufficient to
           allow them to describe and draw what they saw.

           Several years  ago,  Fate  magazine  ran a series  of  excellent
           articles written  by  a  physicist  who had been studying OCCULT
           CHEMISTRY.  He found that the patterns CORRELATED ALMOST EXACTLY
           WITH modern findings of atomic  structure.  We have these papers
           and will place them on KeelyNet as time allows.

           Our friend  Thom  Pawlicki,  author of "How to  Build  a  Flying
           Saucer" and  an excellent book on HyperSpace, writes in a letter
           to us that he believes it is possible to train ones eyes in such
           a manner that the vision path from each eye will NOT collide.

           Thom says that when the vision  paths  REMAIN  PARALLEL  to each
           other, the vision is essentially infinite, thus  allowing one to
           see for miles or into the heart of matter.

           We find   this   of   extreme  interest  since  John  Keely  had
           constructed a special microscope  which allowed him to view into
           the heart of atoms.

           We understand  this device used Ultraviolet rays  but  there  is
           little public  information  on  much of Keely's work beyond that
           which Vangard Sciences/KeelyNet  has  found  and  placed  in the
           public domain.
