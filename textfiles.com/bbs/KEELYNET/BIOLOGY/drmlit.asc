       Following is instructions  on  how  to  build  and  use  Dream Light
       Goggles.  These goggles are intended to be a mechanical aid to Lucid
       Dreaming.  They are  roughly  patterened   after  Stephen  LaBerge's
       "Dreamlight".

       THEORY AND USE:   The best way to understand the use  of dream light
                         goggles is   to   read   Stephen  LaBerge's  book,
                         "Exploring the  world  of  Lucid  Dreaming".   The
                         function of the goggles is based  on  the  use  of
                         "dreamsigns".  A  dreamsign  is  simply  something
                         within a  dream   that   serves   to  trigger  our
                         recognition that  we  are  dreaming   (and  become
                         lucid).  If  you  are  working  on  inducing lucid
                         dreams, dreamsigns  become important.  And the way
                         to use  dreamsigns  is to take notice  of  common,
                         recurring objects   or   events  in  your  dreams.
                         Especially if   these   objects   or  events  have
                         triggered lucidity before.

       For example:  The most common dreamsign for me is  flying.   I  have
       been doing this  flying  for  so  long,  that now, as soon as I find
       myself flying in a dream I almost  always immediately recognize that
       I'm dreaming.

       Another dreamsign I discovered by looking back over  my lucid dreams
       is "cliffs and  high  places".   I have found that these experiences
       often precede my becoming lucid in  a  dream.   Only a couple nights
       after I realized that cliffs were a dreamsign for me  I  had a dream
       in which I  was  climbing  up  the  face  of  a cliff.  I was having
       trouble and thought  I  might fall.   Then  suddenly  it  hit  me...
       Climbing a Cliff!  I'm dreaming!.

       Once you learn what your common dreamsigns are then you must program
       yourself to recognize  that  dreamsign as a indication  that  you're
       dreaming.

       Now the problem  with  dreamsigns  is  that we must wait for them to
       happen and then hope that we recognize  them  when they do. And that
       is the function of the dreamlight.  The dreamlight provides a ready-
       made dreamsign that you can program to happen when you choose.

       The dreamlight or "dream goggles" as I call my device, are designed

                                      Page 1





       to flash a  bright  red  light in your eyes at a predetermined time.
       Unlike LaBerges dreamlight these goggles  have no way of determining
       when you are in REM sleep. So we must use a hit and  miss  technique
       of having them  come on when you're dreaming.  There are two methods
       of doing this:

            (1)  Set the alarm clock to  come  on  about  1-1/2  or 3 hours
                 after you   think  you'll  fall  asleep,   and   set   the
                 sound/light switch  to  light. Then put on the goggles and
                 fall asleep.  The reason  for  1-1/2 or 3 hours is that we
                 normally have  90 minute sleep cycles, and  you  want  the
                 lights to  come  on  as you are passing through REM on the
                 way _out_ of a sleep cycle.

       The problem with this method is that there's a very good chance that
       you won't be  in  REM when the lights  turn  on.   Also  it  can  be
       difficult to sleep for a long period of time with  the  goggles  on.
       However this has  a hidden benifite in that it interrupts your sleep
       pattern so much that that in itself  can  bring about a lucid dream,
       (it worked for me).

           (2)  Set  the  "sound"  alarm to go on at a time  early  in  the
                morning, at  least an hour before you have to get up.  When
                the alarm wakes you up  reach  over  and  push  the  snooze
                button, then  put on the goggles and switch  the  alarm  to
                "lights".  Now  you have 9 minutes to fall back asleep.  If
                you can fall asleep before  the  alarm  (lights)  comes  on
                again you will most likely be in a dream.   If  you  aren't
                quite asleep yet, just push snooze again and try again.

       I have been sucessful with this method.  However more often than not
       I am so  tired when the alarm goes off that I either don't bother to
       mess with the goggles or I put them  on  and  then  fall into a deep
       sleep and sleep right through the flashing lights.

       This is not a fool proof method of attaining lucidity  in  a  dream.
       However I believe  if  you  put  enough  effort into it (more then I
       have), it could prove to be valuable aid.

       Good Luck!

       DISCLAIMER - I believe the device  constructed in the way I describe
       to be safe, but I'm no electrician.  I'm not responsible if it burns
       down your house, or shocks you.  If you're going to  be taking apart
       electrical appliances you  really  should  know  what  you're  doing
       yourself.

       HOW TO BUILD THE DREAM LIGHT GOGGLES

       PARTS: 1.  AC powered LED Alarm  clock  with  at  least  a  9 minute
                  snooze function.   The  clock I use is  a  Spartus  model
                  1108, it  is  small,  about  5.5"X3"X2".   It  cost about
                  $9.00.  Any small LED clock  would  probably work as long
                  as the  voltage  to  the speaker is not  too  high.   The
                  speaker voltage on the Spartus is about 7 volts DC.

              2.  Swim  eye  goggles.  Cost about $7.00.  The main thing is
                  to find  a pair that is  fairly  comfortable.  I'm  using
                  Speedo brand.  You can get cheaper ones, but it might be

                                      Page 2





                  worth it to get a pair you can actually sleep with.

              3.  Two Radio Shack Red High-Brightness Jumbo Blinking Light-
                  Emitting Diodes  Catalog No. 276-020 $3.99 ea.

              4.  One Low-Current Red LED (Light Emitting Diode) $0.89

              5.  About 6 feet of speaker wire.

              6.  One  toggle  switch.  This should be a 3 pole, 2 position
                  switch, like Radio Shack's Mini DPDT #275-663 $3.59
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       ASSEMBLY - STEP ONE:

       Using a tapered steel centerpunch,  or  some  other  suitable device
       burn a hole in the center of each plastic lens of the  swim goggles.
       A  tapered punch  works  well. Use a torch to heat it up, it doesn't
       have to be red hot (if you make it  red hot you will take the temper
       out of the punch).

       Then burn a  hole  in the lens until it is just the  right  size  to
       snugly fit the  Jumbo  Blinking  Diodes.  The diodes are tapered and
       you don't want them to fit all the  way  into  the  goggles  or they
       might touch your  eyelids.  Once you've done this  put  the  goggles
       aside until you wire up the diodes.

       STEP TWO:

       Making sure the  clock  is  unplugged, unscrew the back and take the
       clock apart.  You should be able  to  get  to  the  flat  piezo type
       speaker.  Next burn a hole in the body of the clock  at  the  top to
       hold the toggle  switch.  Make  sure  you put it in a place where it
       won't touch anything on the inside of the clock.

       STEP THREE

       Cut the positive wire leading from the circuit board of the clock to
       the speaker.  Use a voltmeter to  tell  which  one is positive. It's
       not necessarily the red wire. On the clock I used the black wire was
       positive.

       It really doesn't  matter  if you use the negative  instead  of  the
       positive, except that  the  diodes  are  directional,  they  have  a
       positive and negative pole and so  will  only  work in one way.  The
       way I'm describing is assuming you are using the positive side.

       Be sure you cut the speaker wire in a place that  you  can  get  the
       solder leads to  it.   Now solder the positive speaker wire you just
       cut coming from the circuit board  to  the middle pole of the toggle
       switch.

       Now take the  small red LED and solder the long lead  of  the  diode
       (Pos. side) to  one  of  the  outside poles of the toggle switch.  I
       found that there is a residual voltage  in  the speaker circuit even
       when the alarm is not active, and this is enough to cause the diodes
       in the goggles to emit a small amount of light even when the circuit
       is not active.  I tried resisters but I found that  putting this red
       LED in the circuit worked the best to prevent this.  For this reason
       this LED can  be  inside  the  clock  box, just make sure it doesn't
       short against anything.
                                      Page 3





       Next solder one end of one wire in the two wire speaker cable to the
       other lead of the red LED (the short one).  Most speaker cable has a
       way to identify  one  wire from the other. Some have a white line on
       one wire, or one wire may be brass  and  other silver.  It's best to
       use the wire  with  the  marking so that you know  that  it  is  the
       positive side.  The  length  of the wire is to determine how far you
       want to be  from  the clock when you're  sleeping.   6ft  should  be
       plenty.

       Now take the other end of the positive speaker wire and solder it to
       the long (pos)  lead of the first Jumbo Blinking LED.  Then  take  a
       short piece of speaker wire and solder it from the short lead of the
       first Jumbo LED  to  the long lead of the second Jumbo LED.  Be sure
       you make this jumper wire the right  length so that the two LEDs are
       spaced the proper distance apart to fit in the goggles.

       Next take the goggles end of the other speaker wire  (neg. side) and
       solder it to the short lead of the second Jumbo LED.  Take the clock
       end of that same wire and splice it into the negitive speaker wire.
       This makes a  complete circuit from the positive side of the circuit
       board, through the toggle switch,  through the lights in the goggles
       and back to the negative speaker wire leading to the  circuit board.
       This means that  when the switch closes this circuit the lights will
       come on every time the clock sends an alarm pulse to the speaker.

       Now you must conect the other side  of the speaker wire you cut (the
       speaker side) to  the other outside pole of the toggle  switch.  You
       will probably have  to  solder  in  a  jumper wire to do this.  This
       completes the speaker circuit so  that  when  the  switch  is set to
       speaker the speaker  sounds when the alarm turns on.   Be  sure  you
       insulate all your exposed conections.

       Now burn a notch in the back panel of the clock for the goggles wire
       to pass through  and  put  a knot in the wire just inside the box so
       that it can't be pulled out.  Now put the clock back together.

       The last thing to do now is to put  the Jumbo LEDs into the holes in
       the goggle lenses.   Use a black tape to tape them  into  place  and
       block out light  into  the  goggles  from  outside. Insulate all the
       exposed leads of the LEDs.  Run the  wire  from  the  LEDs along the
       goggle strap and tape them to the strap so that the  wire  exit  the
       goggles from the  strap at the back of the head.  Leave enough slack
       to allow for stretching of the strap.

       Well, now your ready.  Good luck,  and  please  report back to me if
       you have any  success  (or  problems) with it.  I'm  always  hanging
       around Sec. 13 of the New Age Forum.  See you there I hope!
