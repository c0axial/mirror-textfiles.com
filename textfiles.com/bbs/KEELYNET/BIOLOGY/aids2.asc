              Lancet - Resistance of AIDS Virus at Room Temperature -
                                September 28, 1985

       LAV/HTLV-III, the agent  causing  AIDS,  has been isolated from body
       fluids (blood, semen,  saliva,  tears).   Its  isolation  in  saliva
       prompted us to  investigate  the  possibility  of   TRANSMISSION  BY
       SALIVA, and we  have studied the sensitivity of LAV/HTLV-III at room
       temperature.

       The virus used  for  the  infectivity   assay   was   left  at  room
       temperature for 0, 2, 4, or 7 days in a sealed tube  or  ALLOWED  TO
       DRY in a petri dish.

       After the times indicated in the figure the virus was used to infect
       stimulated T lymphocytes  and  viral  production  was  determined in
       cell-free supernatant by  testing   for  the  reverse  transcriptase
       activity twice a week.

       [The data] shows   the  UNUSUAL  STABILITY  of  HTLV-III   at   room
       temperature.  No significant difference was found between 0, 2, or 4
       days.  Only a  slight  decrease  is  noted with a delay in the virus
       production indicating a loss of few  infectious  particles  after  7
       days at room temperature.

       Two petri dishes   containing   25,000   cpm   equivalent    reverse
       transcriptase of dry  virus were kept at room temperature for 4 or 7
       days and then resuspended in .220  ml  water and used to measure the
       infectivity.

       As [the data show], significant numbers of viral particles  are then
       inactivated, but some   infectious  virus  is  still  present  since
       release of virus was seen on day 10.  This result indicates that the
       virus is RESISTANT AT ROOM TEMPERATURE, either in DRY form OR LIQUID
       medium.

       This resistance of  LAV  at  room   temperature   MAY   EXPLAIN  THE
       APPEARANCE OF SOME CASES of AIDS cases in NON-RISK GROUPS.

       To prevent possible  contamination  by  viral particles  in  dry  or
       liquid form hygiene should be increased in the general population.

       Moreover, some more safety precautions should be taken in

       laboratories and in  hospitals and by dentists who use a vacuum pump
       for saliva aspiration.  Indeed, these  data strongly support the use
       of disinfectants found to be effective against the AIDS agent.
