Hair loss is a common problem in our society, particularly among men.  As a
result, everyone wants a full head of hair, which has led to many approaches
aimed at restoring hair.

Of the several approaches, some of the most common are :

   1)  wigs, hairpieces and toupees
       (consisting of natural or man-made fibers that emulate hair, these are
       difficult to fit and attach as well as having color or texture matching
       problems with what exists of the ever changing natural hair)

   2)  hair weaves or lengtheners
       (artificial or natural hair is attached or woven into the existing hair
       to increase thickness or length, this is one of the most popular
       non-chemical methods now being offered to the consumer)

   3)  various lotions, shampoos and conditioners which contain ingredients
       that help to deep clean the scalp and the hair follicles
       (one called Mane 'N Tail manufactured by Straight Arrow Corporation, it
       comes in both a Shampoo and Conditioner and is used to clean,
       condition and beautify horse hair, I have been told the Shampoo should
       be rubbed into the scalp over a period of about 5 minutes to allow it
       to clean the scalp, then lightly rinsed out, I tried it and did notice
       some light downy type fuzz growing where none grew before, it sells for
       about $8 for a huge bottle)
   4)  the diluted drug Minoxidil as available in the doctor prescribed
       Rogaine
       (once applied it must be continued or the hair that sprouts will stop
       growing and sometimes fall out)
   5)  herbal and energetic approaches
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hair growth is not a continuous process.  It takes three distinct phases;

   1)  the ANAGEN phase when hair grows the most actively
       (according to superstition, hair grows more rapidly when the moon is
       waxing or getting larger, and slowest when the moon is waning or
       getting smaller)
   2)  the CATAGEN phase is when hair growth slows
       (hair growth can be stimulated by use of glucose '6' phosphate
       dehydrogenase, PDG)
   3)  the TELOGEN phase is when hair stops growing and it will eventually
       fall out

Generally speaking, 10% of the hair on the head has stopped growing and will
fall out through brushing, shampooing or other activities which would dislodge
it.  The other 90% of the hair is typically in the ANAGEN phase and continues
to grow to replace what has fallen out.

It was found that dihydrotestosterone, DHT could block the cellular enery
mechanism, thereby preventing the ANAGEN phase.  Research was carried out to
find what could cause the cells to move from the CATAGEN or TELOGEN phases
back to the ANAGEN phase to promote hair growth.

Greater than 300 materials possessed the necessary odd numbered fatty acids
and it has been demonstrated that application of a high energy substance found
in actively growing hair, such as 3-carbon compound of pentadecanoic acid
glyceride caused a 350% increase in the production of ATP in animal tests.

Hair growth can be stimulated to grow by a variety of different products, all
of which increase the energy level during the anagen phase.  The follicle
energy level has been found to be highly reduced where baldness occurs.

A Dr. Kenkichi Oba claims that PDG (same as G6PHD) can outperform Rogaine in
its ability to stimulate the regrowth of hair.  In a study of 253 male
volunteers, ranging from 27 to 62 years of age, 19 dermatologists found it
increased hair growth permanently, not fading away like Rogaine.  No harsh
side effects were noted in blood, liver or urine analysis.

Biotin is a coenzyme which has been shown to assist carboxylation reactions
(where oxygen is introduced into the cellular energy cycle).  It can reverse
the pattern of balding which includes thinning and depigmentation of the hair.
It is applied topically and has been shown to rejuvenate hair.

The Chinese have long claimed that Ginseng root will prevent the loss of hair.
It is believed to protect the hair and prevent brittleness.

The Japanese have a tree called the Hiba, from which they extract an oil
called hinokitiol.  When the hinokitiol copper salt was mixed as an ingredient
in a tonic and used to treat areas deprived of hair, Japanese studies showed
that thicker hair growth occurred.  Of 11 patients, both male and female, a
downy hair growth occurred between 7 and 60 days.  Alopecia areata was treated
in 10 patients where a 60% increase in downy hair growth occurred over a two
month period.  A Tokyo hospital test of 50 patients yielded 68% effectiveness
in growing downy hair.

A substance made from rice oil, by the trade name Orizanol, is claimed to
stimulate micro-circulation and acts as an anti-oxidant.  Another Japanese
botanical which is applied directly to the scalp to stimulate hair growth is
called SWERTIA (known in China as TOYAKU).

In a clinical study of the Japanese product TAKANAL, a 92% effectiveness
resulted in the growth of downy and eventually coarser hair.  Three amino
acids, cysteine, serine and glutamic acid, when applied topically to the scalp
and combined with the TAKANOL produced a thicker, accelerated growth.  Other
amino acids called TRICHOPEPTIDES, are known to directly affect the hair by
enhancing cell growth.  Of 60 people tested with these trichopeptides, both
men and women, suffering from alopecia, reported a 100% improvement in hair
growth.

A placental extract yielded 70% positive results out of a test of 27 balding
men.

Over a six month period, a miracle compound called Tri-Genesis resulted in a
227% increase of vellus hair.  The key ingredient of this product is an
uneven-chained (odd-numbered) fatty acid, A-ANGELICA LACTONE, which
dramatically reduces the resting stage of hair follicles and gives each hair
an enormous burst of energy.

It has been found that odd-numbered fatty acids increase the amount of ATP
(energy) to the hair follicles.  A Japanese scientist developed an herbal
formula using safflower extract, ginko and ginseng, all excellent vasodilators
which prevents hair loss.

Vasodilation simply means enhanced blood flow, resulting in extra oxygen to
the hair follicles and stimulated growth because of the extra energy.  Rogaine
is a vasodilator.

One of the best overall hair growth stimulators is the product Tri-Genesis,
mostly because it takes a shotgun approach to the problem by using many
different substances that help to stimulate the hair follicles.

Basically, to promote hair growth, you need a means of increasing the blood
flow, oxygen level and the overall energy available to the hair follicles.

You can order Tri-Genesis from Tri-Genesis Corp., 520 Washington Boulevard,
Suite 385, Marina Del Rey, California or calling 1-800-654-0456.

Hinokitiol, Orizanol and Takanal might be available in a Japanese or Chinese
pharmacy or herb shop in major cities.  Also, you might check with your local
health food store for ginseng, swertia or other herbs or compounds listed in
this file.
