       Subject:      CARNIVORA letter to the editor

       The current issue (May/June) of NATURAL HEALTH magazine has a letter
       to the editor  about  an  article  that  appeared in the September /
       October issue of the same magazine.   The  article  was  written  by
       Morton Walker and  it  dealt  with  the  cancer  and   AIDS  fighter
       Carnivora.
                                        ^^^^^^^^^
       The letter to the editor says:

       "I want to thank you for saving our six year old poodle, Max, who
       developed a very aggressive tumor in his mouth this past November.
       I happened to read Morton Walker's article on the cancer and AIDS
       fighter, Carnivora just when it appeared that there was no hope.

       "After removing the  visible tumor and finding that it was cancerous
       to the edges, our local vet referred  us  to a veterinary oncologist
       who told us  that the only way to buy time would  be  to  remove  on
       third of Max's  upper jaw, where the cancer had penetrated, and then
       use radiation or chemotherapy.  But the prognosis was that even with
       that expensive and painful treatment,  our  dog  would  die within a
       year.  Two weeks after the first operation, a tumor  as large as the
       original one had appeared.

       "We had heard about Carnivora from a local vet, but he said it could
       not be obtained in the U.S.  It was then that I happened to read the
       article in your  magazine.  We sent an urgent fax to Dr. Keller, who
       developed the medicine, and hesent us a bottle with instructions for
       our vet.

       "Two weeks after we started giving Max injections of Carnivora, the
       tumor had practically disappeared.  We now have what appears to be a
       normal, health dog who continues to receive the Carnivora injections
       on a maintenance dose.

       "The local vets are simply amazed.  And the cost of the Carnivora
       comes nowhere near the cost of the surgery, chemotherapy/radiation
       therapy proposed by the oncologist.  This is truly a miracle cure.

       "Thank you for publishing such valuable information."

       Subject:      Carnivora Cancer cure Article

       Due to the  high  interest  and  inability  to directly post to some
       people here comes the whole article to the list:

       The following is from the Sept./Oct. 92 issue of Natural Health:
       -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

                 Venus' Flytrap Cancer and Fighter of the Future?

       A German doctor achieves promising  results  with  this  carnivorous
       plant.  Following the removal of malignant polyps  from  his  colon,
       President Ronald Reagan  sent  to Nordhalben, Germany, for an herbal
       extract to take  as  a  preventive   against  the  cancer's  spread.
       Thereafter, he drank 30 drops of this extract, Carnivora, in a glass
       of purified water or herb tea four times a day. According to records
       kept by the extract's German manufacturer, the former U.S. president
       still buys these drops today.

       Carnivora is derived   from   the  plant  Venus'  flytrap   (Dionaea
       muscipula).  This is  a  standardized solution used in the treatment
       of chronic diseases,  including most  forms  of  cancer,  ulcerative
       colitis, multiple sclerosis, all types of herpes infections, chronic
       arthritis, and almost any immune deficiency state,  including  AIDS.
       In cases of  cancer, Carnivora works therapeutically to shrink solid
       tumors, according to its proponents,  but  does  not help with blood
       abnormalities such as leukemia. Also, it works best  if  the patient
       has not previously  undergone  chemotherapy  or  radiation  therapy.
       Carnivora's proponents also   claim    that    in   other   clinical
       applications, it has been effective in boosting immune  function and
       eliminating the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from the blood.

       Carnivora can be   administered  as  drops  for  use  orally  or  by
       inhalation, or it  can  be given by  injection.  Laboratory  studies
       indicate that purified  Carnivora  is  safe,  and   its   new   drug
       application is pending   approval   by  the  German  Food  and  Drug
       Administration. It is readily available  for application to patients
       by physicians in  Germany  and other European countries.   Carnivora
       remains unapproved by  the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
       however, and cannot be imported or  used  legally  except  by people
       suffering from life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and AIDS.

       The discoverer of Carnivora is a researcher and oncologist, Helmut
       Keller, M.D., who  first  studied  the  Venus'  flytrap   at  Boston
       University in 1980.  He  moved  to Germany a year later to find more
       freedom for his Carnivora research.  I  visited  Dr.   Keller at his
       clinic in Bad Steben, Germany, in June 1991, and I  was given access
       to his files.  I have also interviewed about 50 of his patients. One
       was 65-year-old Betty  Williams   of   Ames,  Iowa.  Diagnosed  with
       inflammatory breast disease, the most lethal form of  breast cancer,
       she sought treatment from Dr.  Keller.

       Mrs. Williams's case study reveals that the skin of her right breast
       was at first red, swollen, warm, indurated, and painful.  All of the
       symptoms resembled an  infection,  but  diagnosis by biopsy revealed
       that it was inflammatory carcinoma. Death was likely to occur in a

                                      Page 2





       matter of weeks,  and  the  doctors had no hope for her survival. By
       the time three  American  oncologists   separately   confirmed   the
       diagnosis and prognosis, her breast was turning black.

       "The oncologists told  me  there  really was no hope  of  saving  my
       life," Williams explained.   "They   said   that   they   would  try
       chemotherapy; if I  was  still  alive,   they  would  then  give  me
       radiation; if I  remained  alive,  they would finally  send  me  for
       surgery. I asked, 'What will all this do for me?' And they answered,
       'Just buy you  a  little  time.'  Immediately, therefore, my husband
       bought us airline tickets for Bad Steben, and we left for me to have
       Carnivora treatment.

       "I received one three-hour intravenous injection a day, Monday to
       Friday. I had no side effects except  to  feel  better.  Gradually I
       gained a sense of well-being. The appearance of my breasts came back
       to normal.  The  blackness  and  inflammation totally  disappeared,"
       Williams said.

       Mr. and Mrs. Williams remained with Dr. Keller for three months.
       "At home, now, I take Carnivora intramuscular injections five days a
       week, administered by my husband," Mrs. Williams explained.

       I speak to   Mrs.  Williams  about  once  a  month.  Her  cancer  is
       completely gone and, since the time of her deadly diagnosis nearly 2
       1/2 years ago, it has not returned.  Now,  my  wife,  who has breast
       cancer, is taking Carnivora regularly as part of her cancer therapy.
       She has been doing so since our first visit to Bad Steben.

       In addition to its success in cancer, Carnivora has had a dramatic
       effect on patients infected with HIV, the virus cited as the cause
       of AIDS.

       Dr. Keller learned   that   various  strengths  of   the   Carnivora
       formulations work for  all  diseases in which immune stimulation and
       modulation are required. Besides  having  the  ability to reduce the
       growth rate of  tumor  tissue, Carnivora increases  the  number  and
       activity of the sick person's T-helper cells and other immune system
       components. I have observed laboratory test readings on HIV-positive
       patients, recorded by   Dr.   Keller   and  some  American  holistic
       physicians. The patients' T-helper  cell  counts rose from as low as
       11 per cubic millimeter of blood to well beyond 700,  while  the  T-
       suppressor cells decreased  sharply.  This  makes  the  individual's
       important helper/suppressor ratio almost normal.

       The most surprising result has been  Carnivora's  direct  effect  in
       reducing the viability  of  the  HIV.  Quite simply,  an  identified
       biochemical ingredient in  Carnivora kills the AIDS virus. Also, the
       Beta-2 Microglobulin test, which  measures  the  amounts  of  plasma
       proteins produced by HIV, decreases. This test for beta-2 levels is
       judged to be the most accurate of all predictors of HIV progression
       to AIDS. A decrease in beta-2 levels indicates that the HIV patient
       is not advancing to full-blown AIDS.

       Because Carnivora is not approved in the U.S., American  doctors are
       forbidden by law from stocking or prescribing it for patients.  Such
       prescriptions must come  from  an attending physician outside of the
       country. Therefore, Helmut Keller,  the  extract's developer, offers
       the appropriate protocol to persons with cancer, AIDS, or some other

                                      Page 3





       degenerative or infectious  disease  who  furnish  him  with medical
       records. Also, any  patient  who  suffers  from  a  life-threatening
       illness has the right to import a three-month supply of Carnivora or
       other non-FDA-approved remedies  for his or her personal  use.  This
       being done, there   are  two  methods  by  which  Carnivora  may  be
       administered for the American patient.

       First, the patient  or  a skilled  person  like  a  nurse  can  give
       intramuscular or intravenous injections at home. When Carnivora has
       been used in  its  most  purified  form,  which is  protected  under
       patents in Germany  and the U.S. by Dr. Keller, no side effects have
       been reported.  Second, by acting  merely  as the medical technician
       and following Dr.   Keller's  protocol, your own American  physician
       can administer the treatment.

       Indeed, it is best that you have medical supervision when you add
       Carnivora to your treatment program against cancer, AIDS, or other
       pathologies.

       ONE WOMAN'S STORY

          As part of her routine annual health maintenance practice, a
       sixty-five year-old retired school teacher, Betty Williams of Ames,
       Iowa, underwent a  number  of  diagnostic  examinations.   She had a
       physical examination by her family  physician  in  December  1989, a
       mammogram by an oncologist in January 1990, and an  internal checkup
       by her gynecologist   in  February  1990.   The  collective  medical
       opinion rendered was that Mrs. Williams  was  in  great shape - very
       healthy.  She took  no  medication of any kind - not  even  aspirin.
       "On April 11,  1990,  while  babysitting  with  a  new grandchild in
       Providence, Rhode Island, I noticed while dressing that my right

                                      Page 4





       breast was red  and  swollen.   Immediately  I  went to a Providence
       gynecologist, and, in  turn,  he   referred   me   to   a  surgeon",
       Mrs.Williams told me during our interviews.

          "Both specialists  said  that  they  did  not know  what  was  my
       problem.  They put  me on antibiotics, and I left to go home to Iowa
       the next day.  On April 16th I visited  my gynecologist who has been
       caring for me  for  years.   He  was uncertain about  the  condition
       affecting my breast, and be increased the dosage of antibiotics.  He
       thought I might have an infection.  There was no lump - only redness
       and soreness.  It  was  inflamed  but  with  no pressure pain, and I
       could wear a brassiere comfortably.   As  it  happens,  three  years
       before, I had  had  an  injury  during the course  of  receiving  my
       routine annual mammogram,  and this injury required that I undergo a
       minor operation.  So, April 20th,  I returned to that same operating
       surgeon for a new examination and possible diagnosis.  His guess was
       that I had inflammatory carcinoma, and he prescribed  another,  more
       potent antibiotic," said  Mrs.  Williams.  We'll wait a little bit,'
       he said.

          Well, I waited four days and then  consulted  the  breast  cancer
       specialist who had  done  my  mammogram  the previous  January.   He
       checked with the   doppler   ultrasound   technique,   took  another
       mammogram, and then sent me to the breast surgeon for a biopsy to be
       done under a general anesthetic.   On  Monday,  April  30,  1990,  I
       learned that I truly did have breast cancer inflammatory carcinoma."
       Inflammatory carcinoma is  atypical of breast cancer,  for  in  this
       condition the tumor  grows with great rapidity; the skin over it is,
       edematous and becomes red, warm, indurated, and painful.  All of-the
       symptoms resemble an infection.  Diagnosis is established by biopsy.
       Any form of raidical surgery is always  contraindicated  because the
       disease tends to recur locally with great speed in the postoperative
       period.  Palliative treatment  with  radiotherapy (with  or  without
       simple mastectomy) followed  by hormonal therapy or chemotherapy may
       be offered but they are of little  use.  Death is likely to occur in
       a matter of weeks following the diagnosis.

          "Upon hearing  my  diagnosis,  I did not panic  -  at  least  not
       entirely!  Just two  weeks  before, my son had attended a lecture in
       Minneapolis given by Chrystyne Jackson,  publisher  of the magazine,
       Raum & Zeit.   She  told the audience of a German physician,  Helmut
       Keller, M.D., who  advocates  the  use  of  a  very  special natural
       medication for treating cancer,"  Mrs.   Williams  explained.  "So I
       telephoned Dr.  Keller  in  Germany  the  next  day   and   made  an
       appointment to see  him  right  away.   That  same afternoon, I kept
       another appointment with a third oncologist.   I brougth my records;
       he examined me.  That specialist told me there really  is no hope of
       saving my life.  The oncologist said that he would try chemotherapy;
       if I was still alive, he would then give me radiation; if I remained
       alive, he would finally send me for surgery.  I asked, What will all
       this do for  me?"   And  be  answered, "Just buy you a little time."
       Immediately, therefore, my husband bought us airline tickets for Bad
       Steben, West Germany, and we took off on May 3rd.

         By the time that Dr. Keller examined  me  on  May  4th,  my  right
       breast was black  and  had  a  lump in it that was  larger  than  my
       husbands fist," said  the patient.  "Dr. Keller just groaned when be
       saw it and added, 'We have a lot of work to do.'  "After I had taken
       treatment in Bad Steben for a week, we began to see a little

                                      Page 5





       progress," said Mrs.   Williams.   "My husband took some pictures of
       my breasts after Dr. Keller had already  begun  to give me infusions
       with Carnivora.  I received one three-hour intravenous  injection  a
       day, Monday to Friday.  I had no side effects except to feel better.
       Gradually I gained  a  sense of wellbeing.  From his baseline tests,
       he was aware  that  my  immune  system   was  much  depressed.   For
       instance, my killer  T-cells were down to 3, and he  built  up  that
       reading to 13.   Also  my  helper/suppressor  cells  had been out of
       balance, but they rearranged themselves  to  a  normal  level.   The
       appearance of my breasts came back to normal too; the  blackness and
       inflammation totally disappeared."

          Mr. and Mrs.  Williams remained with Dr. Keller for three months,
       until August 1, 1990.  He lodged them in his clinic which has motel-
       like facilities that look out on rolling forest lands.  "It was very
       beautiful countryside," admits  Mrs. Williams.  "If it wasn't that I
       was ill, we could have considered  those  three  months our European
       vacation.  We took long walks in the woods every  day  and  had many
       recreational activities available.   "At home, now, I take Carnivora
       intrarmuscular injections five  days  a  week,  administered  by  my
       husband.Except that I don't have quite as much energy  as I used to,
       right now I feel fine - really good," said the Iowa resident.  "What
       I know is  that  Dr.   Keller saved my life by use of his innovative
       biological methods.  Everyone  with   a  life-threatening  condition
       should have access to Carnivora and not need to travel to Germany to
       receive it."  On February 26, 1991, I checked on the  health  status
       of Betty Williams.   She  is  alive  and  well - even thriving - and
       traveling the United States with ber  husband  in their mobile home.
       They are enjoying their retirement.

       Inflammatory carcinoma in  the  right  breast of Betty  Williams  of
       Ames, Iowa, a  photograph  that  was  taken  one  week following the
       commencement of treatment with Carnivora by Helmut Keller, M.D.  The
       intravenous infusion consists of 5  ml of Carnivora dissolved in 250
       ml of physiological  saline  administered  Monday  through   Friday.
       Administered also is 2 ml of Carnivora as an intermuscular injection
       on a five-day-per-week  schedule  over  a  three-month  period.  The
       patient's breast shows inflammation,  blackness,  and  swelling, but
       before this initial  five  days  of  treatment  was   received,  the
       patient's disease signs  were  worse.  Inflammatory carcinoma in the
       right breast of the same patient is gone.  This photograph was taken
       three months after  the  full  Carnivora   treatment   program   was
       administered to her.    Betty  Williams  is  now  on   a   Carnivora
       maintenance program at  home  with  an  optimal  schedule  of  2  ml
       injected two to three times weekly from three months onward (for two
       years or more), depending on the patienes blood CD, cells.

       THE DECADE-LONG USAGE of CARNIVORA

            Since 1981,  over  2,000  patients   have   been  treated  with
       Carnivora.  Among them has been President Ronald Reagan who received
       the substance postoperatively following his operation  for malignant
       polyps of the  colon.   The President took Carnivora drops for their
       healing and preventive powers against  cancer  recurrence.  Probably
       he continues to  take  them  even  today.  It's suspected,  but  not
       confirmed, that Nancy   Reagan  takes  Carnivora  for  avoiding  the
       recurrence of her breast cancer.

            Also, actor Yul Brynner(now deceased), from receiving dosages
       of Carnivorain injections and/or Carnivora drops, had experienced a
       reversal of signs and symptoms of adenocarcinoma of lung, a common,
       peripherally-spreading malignancy through   the   bloodstream.   The
       actor traveled to Hannover, West  Germany  to  consult  Hans Nieper,
       M.D..  In turn, Dr.  Nieper contacted Dr. Keller in  order to become
       educated about the beneficial properties and dosages of this extract
       of the Venus Fly Trap.

            Dr. Nieper   took  his  colleague's  advice  and  utilized  the
       nontoxic extract which Dr. Keller  supplied at no charge.  In just a
       short time regression   of   Yul  Brynner's  adenocarcinoma   became
       apparent by means  of  diagnostic procedures.  His lung tumor's size
       diminished considerably within  several  weeks.   The  patient  left
       Germany believing that his cancer was cured and continued taking the
       Carnivora for only  two  years.   Then,  he foolishly  followed  the
       recommendation of a  New  York City oncologist and failed to keep up
       the remedy.  Brynner did not understand  that  the Carnivora therapy
       required self-administration five  times  weekly for  an  indefinite
       period.  Therefore, the  actor's  lung  tumor"  began  its  previous
       growth.  Still, Yul Brynner did not  die from cancer.  What actually
       killed him on October 10, 1985 was meningitis.

       CARNIVORA CURE

            The therapeutic benefits of this extract of the Venus Fly Trap
       plant were discovered by Dr. Helmut Keller in a serendipitous way.
       His first suspicions as to the phytopharmacon's usage began during
       January 1973 as he observed the feeding actions of some plants grown
       by Elga his  wife,  in  her  window boxes.  They lived  in  Needham,
       Massachusetts, a Boston   suburb,   while   Dr.   Keller  worked  on
       tumorgenesis in the animal laboratories of Boston University.

            Elga's carnivorous  plants  were  digesting  primitive  protein
       tissues such as  flies, small worms and other insects.   During  his
       observations of their  foraging  behavior, it struck Dr. Keller that
       the pressed juices of Dioncea muscipula  might  be  useful  for  the
       treatment of cancer   and   possibly   other  chronic   degenerative
       diseases. At the   time   he   was  worldng  with  Syrian  hamsters.
       Therefore, for eleven  months  Dr.   Keller  experimented  with  the
       extract of Venus Fly Trap by applying it to human tumor  tissue  two
       centimeters in diameter  which  he  had  transplanted into the cheek
       pouches of the  hamsters.   Comparing   the   treated  rodents  with
       controls, he administered Carnivora to one group of the cancer-laden
       animals and cured them.

       SOME LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS WITH CARNIVORA

            Hydroplumbagin-4-0-beta-glucopyranoside (plumbagin),   a   main
       component of Camivora  which  has  high immune-stimulating activity,
       was isolated in 1988.  Two ml of  the  extract  contains 67.4 mcg of
       this component.'

            In his Syrian hamster experiments, Dr.  Keller implanted equal
       amounts of human   lymphosarcoma   and   squamous  epithelial   cell
       carcinoma tissues into the cheek pouches of l2O animals. Within nine
       weeks, thirty transplants  grew  to  tumor diameters of 10 to 12 mm.
       Twelve of these hamsters were treated  with 1-5 ml Dionaea muscipula
       injectable solution at two-day intervals.  After 15 injections all

                                      Page 7





       of the treated  animals  showed  a caseous degeneration and complete
       lysis of the tumor masses.

            Six hamsters  treated intraperitoneally  with  1.5  ml  of  O.9
       percent salt solution   served  as  non-medicated   controls.    The
       controls implants grew into full blown cancer and killed them.

          In another  experiment,  into  the  necks  of  mice crushed tumor
       tissue containing Harding-Passey  melanosarcoma  cells  was injected
       subcutaneously.  The animals were divided into three groups.

            Group one  was  the  negative  control  and, as  treatment,  it
       received 0.9 percent  sodium  chloride solution intravenously and/or
       intraperitoneally.

            Group two was the positive control, and it received a similar
       technique of treatment with cyclophosphamide,  a substance known for
       its growth inhibiting  properties.   However,  cyclophosphamide   is
       toxic if administered  for a prolonged period; therefore, Dr. Keller
       discontinued its use after 12 days  in order to prevent the death of
       this group of animals.

            For the  third  group, within 24 hours of transplantation,  the
       researcher administered Carnivora   extract   intravenously   and/or
       intrapezitoneally to these mice for 20 days.

            With all  the  animals,  on   the   29th  day  following  tumor
       transplantation, the tumors  were  removed and weighed.   Using  the
       tumor weight in  the  animals of group one as a standard, Dr. Keller
       learned that cyclophosphamide at  25mg/kg  body  weight 'reduced the
       tumor weight by 99% but with metabolic toxicity as a consequence.

         'Carnvora at lOOmg/kg bodyweight caused a reduction  of  the tumor
       weight to 59% with no toxicity for the animal.

            The cytostatic  effect  in capillaries is a slowing of movement
       and accumulation of   blood  cells,   especially   polymorphonuclear
       leukocytes.  As the  ATP-content  of  a  substance   decreases,  its
       cytostatic effect increases.

            Using bioluminescence,  by  measuring  the  ATP-content of Hela
       cells, the product's developer determined  the  cytostatic effect of
       Carnivora.  After inoculating Hela cells with Carnivora dilutions of
       1:10, 1:100, and 1:1000, in 1, 24, 48 and 72 hours,  Dr.   Keller  -
       found that the   Hela  cells,  ATP-values  were  sigificantly  lower
       compared to the controls (see illustrations #4 and #5).

            Carnivora in a dilution of 1:10 caused an ATP-loss of 50% after
       1 hour of Hela cells incubation.   After  24  bours, the cells' ATP-
       content was zero.

            Dr. Keller  performed  many  more laboratory experiments  which
       pointed up the  therapeutic  effect  of Carnivora against cancer and
       other immune suppression diseases.   For  instance,  he  did several
       phagocytosis assays on human granulocyte fractions   incubated  with
       yeast cells and  plumbagin  with  resulting  immunoinduction.  Since
       this article would  be  overly long  if  all  of  his  investigative
       efforts were to  be  described,  suffice  it to say  that  Carnivora
       proved itself as an in vitro and in vivo immunological booster.

        Identity, Indications, Formulations, and Dosages of Carnivora

            Pressed juices  of  Dionaea  muscipula, an extract of the Venus
       Fly Trap plant  (see  illustration   #6),  provides  a  standardized
       phytopharma-ceutical agent designated as 'Carnivora." In the form of
       Carnivora drops for  oral  and  inhalation  use  and  as  Camivorain
       injections for intravenous  and  intramuscular  administration,  the
       exact has been  used  successfully  for  the  treatment  of  chronic
       diseases including most  forms of cancer, neurodermitis,  ulcerative
       colitis, Crohn's disease,  multiple  sclerosis,  all types of herpes
       infections, primary chronic polyarthritis,  and  almost  any  immune
       deficiency state.  It is highly effective for the total  elimination
       of the HIV  virus  in  vivo from human blood and may be considered a
       cure for the autoimmune deficiency syndrome - AIDS.

            I have already pointed out that  a  series  of long- and short-
       term in vitro and in vivo laboratory studies on tissue  cultures and
       laboratory animals proved  that  Carnivora is extremely nontoxic and
       non-mutagenic.  Following German Food  and Drug Administration (GMP)
       guidelines, the endotoxin  activities  of Carnivora  are  less  than
       O.5ng/ml.This phytopharmacon offers    the   following   therapeutic
       benefits against multiple forms of  cancer,  AIDS, and other chronic
       pathologies: (1) cytostasis,    (2)    mitotic    inhibition,    (3)
       immunoinduction, (4) virucidal effect, and (5) alleviation of pain.

            Each 50  ml  of  the Carnivora injectable solution contains the
       sterile pressed juice of the entire  fresh  Venus Fly Trap, adjusted
       to 2% dry residue and isotonicity with mannitol.

            Each milliliter of the Carnivora Venus Fly Trap drops contains
       three ingredients, each comprising one third of the  solution.  That
       is, Carnivora drops  contain  one  third of the pressed juice of the
       entire fresh plant adjusted to 2%W/W  dry  residue, one third of 86%
       ethanol, and one third purified water.

            Making therapeutic  use  of  the  Carnivora  50  ml  injectable
       solution for intramuscular purposes, 2 ml are administered daily for
       any of the  chronic  diseases  already  named  until  the  therapist
       observes an increase in the patient's  helper/suppressor cell ratio.
       Then the same dosage of 2 ml is administered to the patient by means
       of intramuscular injection twice or thrice weekly as  a  maintenance
       dosage.

            For oral   administration,  the  100  ml  oral  formulation  of
       Carnivora is taken by the patient  as 30 drops three to five times a
       day before meals and diluted in a glass of purified  water  or  tea.
       Without diluting it  in  a  glass ofwater, the taste of concentrated
       Carnivora is similar to that of a  shot  of  aged  whiskey.  As with
       drinking any alcoholic  beverage  that  burns the tongue,  it  takes
       getting used to.

            For inhalation purposes, 2 ml of the Carnivora oral formulation
       should be mixed  with  2 ml of 0.9% salt solution and inhaled by the
       patient five times tillly by means of a cold steam vaporizer.

            The commercial  Carnivora  product   is   manufactured  by  the
       Carnivora Research Company,     Lobensteinerstmsse     S,     D-8646
       Norclhalben, West Germany;    direct   telephone   Oll-49-9267-1662;
       teleFAX011- 9267-1040.  In accordance  with  laws  of the country of
       import, Carnivora is available for purchase.

            As a  teleFAX  response  to  my  query about whether physicians
       around the world might administer  Carnivora  to their patients, Dr.
       Keller wrote:

           'Yes, but  I would like to induce the treatment  myself  in  Bad
            Steben for  the  period of four to six weeks, and discharge the
            patient to that referring physician with an optimal schedule of
            treatment." He welcomes physician preceptorships.'

       CARNIVORA AS A CURE FOR HIV-POSITIVE PATIENTS

            In Los   Angeles,  Ronald  T.  Asti,  a  forty-seven   year-old
       landscape gardener whose  blood  serum  tested  positive for the p24
       core antigen of  the  human  immunodeficiency   virus  (HIV-1),  was
       invited by Dr.  Keller to come to his Bad Steben clinic  to  receive
       treatment with Carnivora  at  no  charge.  "It was my lucky day.  My
       health was declining," Mr. Asti said.   "I  was  losing  weight-, my
       energy was way  down,  and  the  treatment  sounded   terrific.   It
       couldn't hurt, even  if it did not help."The patient had listened to
       a lecture presented by Dr. Keller  in  Pasadena,  California  at the
       Cancer Control Society's 18th Annual Convention, September 2, 1990.
       At this meeting Mr. Asti had approached the physician  about  how he
       might have Carnivora administered to him.

            "Six years ago," Asti continued, "I was diagnosed with HIV, and
       somewhere along the  line  I was infected with cytomegalovirus, too.
       Years before I had come down with  syphilis and was treated, but the
       condition kept coming back so that my immune system got run into the
       ground.  I never really did get over the syphilis,  even though last
       year I went on high doses of antibiotics for two months.

            "My true HIV diagnosis was AIDS- related complex (ARC) with
       frequent infections hitting me, being tired all the time.  And I had
       a problem in  that  I  saw  seven  doctors  in seven years, each one
       relating my condition to something  other  than the diagnosis of the
       doctor before -  herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus,  candidiasis,  and
       more.  Treatment with lots of antibiotics afforded me no help," Asti
       said."l was getting  sicker all the time.  In September 1990, when I
       consulted with Dr.  Keller in Pasadena,  I  was losing an average of
       one pound a day, my weight had dropped from 189 pounds to 168.  If I
       managed to work even one day, I needed four days to sleep.  The heat
       in Los Angeles  just wiped me out.  It was a very unhealthy  picture
       for me in the summer of 1990."

            His steady physical deterioration and lack of assistance he was
       receiving from conventional   medicine  caused  Asti  to  seek  out,
       Alternative medical care.  From   what  he  had  heard,  the  Keller
       Carnivora treatment program  seemed  to  match  his  need.   Indeed,
       within four months  of  Ronald  Asti's  embarking  for  Germany,  he
       returned to the  United  States   completely   cured  of  ARC.   The
       patient's blood shows absolutely no signs of HIV-1 antigen.

           "Pouring out of my body was much debris," Asti  explained  to me
       during our telephone  interview - he in Bad Steben, West Germany and
       me in Stamford, Connecticut - during his last week of receiving

                                      Page 10





       Carnivora treatment at  the  Chronic  Disease  Control and Treatment
       Center.  "Mucous came out of my nose  as if I had a bad cold; debris
       showed up on my skin in the form of pimples, papules, tiny blisters,
       and other skin eruptions in the head and neck areas.   It  was  just
       like I had  teenage  acne.  During this time I showed no temperature
       elevation, and my energy was exceedingly high.  I felt great and was
       active, but my lungs and bronchiole areas seemed much congested, and
       I coughed up phlegm.  It was eight  weeks  into  the  treatment that
       this entire detoxification action began for me.  I  urinated  more -
       at least ten urinations a day.

            Then my  T4  helper  cell  count started to elevate, and it did
       rise from 350  to over 1700.  At  the  eleventh  week  of  Carnivora
       treatment, my helper/suppressor  cell ratio increased  from  O.2  to
       l.00,"said the patient   The  known  normal  helper/suppressor  cell
       ratio is 1.5.| 'I was getting well  by  being  infused  with 5 ml of
       Carnivora in sodium chloride solution five days a week, plus 2 ml of
       Carnivora by intramuscular injection in the thigh.   By  week 10, my
       blood got so  dirty  with  dead  HIV  viruses,  Dr.  Keller's  blood
       monitoring machine could not measure  it anymore.  So, I traveled to
       an independent laboratory in Frankfurt for AIDS testing.   There  it
       was discovered that the HIV virus in my body was totally inactivated
       and dead.  Learning  that,  I  cried  with  joy.  I'm cured of AIDS!
       Please tell doctors about the Carnivora  treatment  program  so that
       others may live.

            Let me tell you, Dr. Keller is loved by everyone, because he
       loves people and is really interested in them.  He doesn't let the
       patient hang loose," said Ronald T.  Asti - 'I feel so very indebted
       and grateful to him.  Dr. Keller knows exactly what's going on with
       each of his patients, and he truly cares about all of them.'

       Subject: Re: Alternative cancer therapies
       Susan and everyone--

       I sent a  reply  to the wrong list about a book that was recommended
       to me by a friend.  Boy, do I feel  dumb.   At any rate, the book is
       called Heal Your Cancer Naturally--my friend thinks  the  author  is
       Edie Mae.  She  is also fighting against cancer which was thought to
       be gone but has returned in her bones--sounds  bad--she  broke a hip
       just turning over  in  bed  a few weeks ago.  But  she  is  in  good
       spirits, and would  appreciate  any advice on alternative therapies.
       My friend's name is Day--oh, and  the  other  thing  I posted to the
       *wrong list* was  that  the  March/April  issue  of  Natural  Health
       magazine has several   comprehensive  articles  on  the  results  of
       alternative therapies with various kinds of cancer. Thanks. - Lyn B.
