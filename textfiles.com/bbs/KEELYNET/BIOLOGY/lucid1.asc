          Most people  don't  realize  they've  been  dreaming  until after
       they've awakened and the dream has  come  to  an  end.  Some people,
       however, are conscious that they're dreaming. These  lucid dreamers,
       scientists have discovered,  can  literally direct their actions and
       change the content of a dream, deciding perhaps to talk physics with
       Einstein, woo and  marry a movie  star,  or  assume  the  powers  of
       Superman.

          After nearly a decade of piloting these daring nocturnal flights,
       two psychologists -  Stephen LaBerge of Stanford University,  author
       of LUCID DREAMING   (Ballentine),   and   Jayne  Gackenbach  of  the
       University of Northern Iowa - have  begun  to  develop  a  series of
       techniques aimed at  helping  ordinary  dreamers "turn"  lucid,  and
       lucid dreamers gain  greater  control over the wooly behemoth of the
       night. These special techniques, still under development, have never
       before been presented in a public forum.

          For those who have aquired the  knack  of  lucidity, the benefits
       can be enormous. Lucid dreaming gives one the chance  to  experience
       adventures rarely surpassed elsewhere in life. These experiences can
       enhance self-confidence and   promote   personal  growth  and  self-
       development. By facing fears and  learning  to  make the best of the
       worst situation imaginable, lucid dreamers can overcome  nightmares.
       Because recent scientific   studies   have   demonstrated  a  strong
       connection between dreams  and the  biological  functioning  of  the
       body, lucid dreams  might  facilitate  physical as  well  as  mental
       health. And finally,  because  lucid  dreaming  allows us to tap the
       power of the unconscious, it may also be useful for creative problem
       solving.

          To direct  your own nightly dream-time  show,  attempt  exercises
       one, two, three and four as outlined below. LaBerge  and  Gackenbach
       suggest that you  do the tasks as often as possible. Some people may
       succeed in having a lucid dream the  very  first  night they use the
       techniques; others, the researchers note may need  to  practice  for
       several weeks before getting results.

                                   EXERCISE ONE

          A number  of  techniques  facilitate  lucid  dreaming. One of the
       simplest is asking yourself many  times  during  the day whether you
       are dreaming.  Each time you ask the question, you  should  look for
       evidence proving you are not dreaming. The most reliable test: Read

                                      Page 1





       something, look away  for  a  moment,  and then read it again. If it
       reads the same way twice, it is unlikely that you're dreaming. After
       you have proved to yourself that  you  are  not  presently dreaming,
       visualize yourself doing whatever it is you'd like.

          Also, tell yourself that you want to recognize a  nighttime dream
       the next time it occurs.  The mechanism at work here is simple; it's
       much the same  as  picking  up  milk  at  the  grocery  store  after
       reminding yourself to do so an hour before.

          At night  people usually realize  they  are  dreaming  when  they
       experience unusual or bizarre occurrences. For instance, if you find
       yourself flying with no visible means of support, you should realize
       that this only  happens  in  dreams and that you must  therefore  be
       dreaming.

          If you  awaken from a dream in the middle of the night, it's very
       helpful to return to the dream immediately, in your imagination. Now
       envision yourself recognizing the dream as such. Tell yourself, "The
       next time I am dreaming, I want to  remember  to recognize that I am
       dreaming." If your  intention is strong and clear  enough,  you  may
       find yourself in a lucid dream when you return to sleep.

                                   EXERCISE TWO

          Many lucid dreamers report dreams in which they fly unaided, much
       like Superman. Some  lucid  dreamers  say that flying is a thrilling
       means of travel; others, that it has  helped them return from one of
       the more harrowing dream experiences --- the endless fall.

          Why is dream flying so important ? It's a form of  dream  control
       that's fairly easy  to  master. It gives the dreamer an exhilarating
       sense of freedom.  And it's a basic  means  of  travel  in the dream
       world.

          How do  you make a dream flight happen at all?  We  suggest  that
       before you retire for bed, you simply repeat these words: "Tonight I
       fly!" Then while still awake, imagine that journey.

          If you find yourself flying, it will be a clear sign that you are
       in a dream.  In any case, when you realize you're dreaming, remember
       that you want to fly. When you actually  feel  yourself flying, say,
       "This is a  dream."  Make  sure that you start modestly,  by  simply
       floating above the surface of your dream ground.

          As you  gain  confidence, both in the notion that you're dreaming
       and in your ability to control that experience, you might experiment
       with flying a bit more. Run, taking  big leaps, and stay aloft for a
       few seconds so that you resemble an astronaut walking  on  the moon.
       Try sustained floating, and then flying at low altitudes.

          As your  confidence  increases, so will your flying skills. While
       asleep, work on increasing altitude,  maneuverability, and speed. As
       with speed sports,  you  should  perfect height and  maneuverability
       before speed.  Of course, you couldn't really hurt yourself --- it's
       only a dream.  But you could get scared.

          After you  get  proficient  in  dream  flying,  remember  to  ask
       yourself these questions : "How high can I fly ? Can I view the

                                      Page 2





       earth from outer  space ? Can I travel so fast that I lose awareness
       of my surroundings and experience the sensation of pure speed ?"

          Throughout your efforts in dream  flight,  please  remember  that
       you're in a dream. With this in mind, your fears  will  be  held  at
       bay, and your control over your dream will be greatly enhanced.

                                  EXERCISE THREE

          Even if  you're  a frequent lucid dreamer, you may not be able to
       stop your-self from waking up in mid-dream.  And even if your dreams
       reach a satisfying end, you may not be able to focus them exactly as
       you please.

          During our  years  of  research,  however,  we  have  found  that
       spinning your dream  body  can  sustain the period of sleep and give
       you greater dream  control.  In  fact,  many  subjects  at  Stanford
       University have used the spinning technique as an effective means of
       staying in a lucid dream. The task outlines below will  help you use
       spinning as a means of staying asleep and, more exciting, as a means
       of traveling to whatever dream world you desire.

          As with  dream  flying, the dream spinning task starts before you
       go to bed.  Before retiring, decide on a person, time, and place you
       would like to visit in your lucid dream. The target person and place
       can be either real or imaginary, past, present or future.

          For instance,  Sigmund  Freud,  Vienna,  1900;  Stephen  LaBerge,
       Stanford, the present; or the president of the solar  system, Galaxy
       Base, 2900. Write  down  and  memorize your target person and place,
       then visualize yourself visiting your  target  and firmly resolve to
       do so in a dream that night.

          When following this procedure, it is possible that you might find
       yourself visiting your  target  in a non-lucid dream;  you  will  be
       aware that this  happened  only  after you awaken. Nevertheless, you
       should strive for lucidity by following  the  techniques in exercise
       one. Then proceed to your goal.

          To do so, repeat the phrase describing your target in your dream,
       and spin your whole dream body in a standing position with your arms
       outstretched. You can pirouette or spin like a top,  as  long as you
       vividly feel your body in motion.

          The same  spinning  technique  will help when, in the middle of a
       lucid dream, you feel the dream imagery  beginning to fade. To avoid
       waking up, spin as you repeat your target phrase  again  and  again.
       With practice, you'll return to your target person, time, and place.

                                   EXERCISE FOUR

          Up until  now  we  have had little control over the occurrence of
       creative dreams. But with lucid  dreaming  it  may  be  possible  to
       intentionally access the creativity of the dream state. You can help
       determine the feasibility  of  this idea by attempting  to  solve  a
       problem in a  lucid dream. Before bed, decide on a problem you would
       like to solve. Frame your problem  in  the  form of a question.  For
       example : "What is the topic of my next book ?" "How  can  I  become
       less shy ?"  If  you have an illness, you might consider the problem
       "How can I regain my health ?"
                                      Page 3





          Once you  have  selected  a  problem  question, write it down and
       memorize it.  When   doing   the  lucid-dream-induction   exercises,
       remember your question and see yourself looking for  the  answer  in
       your next lucid  dream.  Then,  when  in  a  lucid  dream,  ask  the
       question, and seek the solution.

          You might be most successful at  problem  solving if you take the
       direct approach. For instance if your problem is  shyness,  be  less
       shy in your  dream.  If your problem is health, try to heal yourself
       in the dream. Then reflect on how your dream solution relates to the
       waking problem.

          It may help to question other  dream  characters,  especially  if
       they represent people  who  you  think  might know the  answer.  For
       example, if you  were  trying  to  solve  a  physics problem, Albert
       Einstein might be a good dream character  to  query.  You  can  even
       combine this task with the dream spinning and flying tasks, visiting
       an expert on  your  problem.  You can also just explore  your  dream
       world with your  question  in mind, looking for any clues that might
       suggest an answer.

       For those of you who have made it  this far, I have just a couple of
       comments.  Lucid dreaming is the absolute MOST fun  I've  ever  had,
       and that's saying  a  lot,  since I've had some terrific times while
       awake.

       I can't dream lucidly every night,  and  if I stop the exercises, it
       takes a couple  of days to get things lucid again.  If  you  do  try
       lucid dreaming, don't expect results the first night.  Give it a few
       days, and keep up the exercises. They really work.

       I've found that  it helps me to write down every detail I can recall
       from a dream as soon as I get up in the morning. Then before bed the
       next night, I read those details,  making  them fresh in my mind. It
       seems to help bring on dreams that night.
