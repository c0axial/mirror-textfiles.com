       Vangard Notes...

       First, we must place a disclaimer in this file informing all readers
       that we are in no way prescribing, diagnosing or making any attempts
       to practice medicine.

       The information which follows is taken from various accounts as well
       as personal knowledge   and   experiments   done   with   the   RIFE
       frequencies.  The information is NOT  to  be taken as advice or as a
       substitute for qualified  medical  assistance and  we  will  not  be
       responsible for any  problems  which  might  result from experiments
       undertaken using the RIFE information as listed on KeelyNet.

       If you have a medical condition, please  consult a qualified medical
       practitioner.

       The following is  a  recounting of a personal experience  using  the
       RIFE frequencies.  For   additional   information   regarding   this
       subject, download the files RIFE1.ASC,  RIFE2.ASC  and the frequency
       list RIFEFREQ.ASC.  A Dbase program is also included  with  the RIFE
       frequencies under the filename RIFEBASE.ZIP.

                  A SHORT WORD ABOUT THE RIFE FREQUENCY GENERATOR

       If you understand  how a wine glass can be destroyed by singing into
       it at its' resonant frequency, then  you  understand  how  the  Rife
       frequencies can accomplish  the  same  effect  when   tuned  to  the
       fundamental resonant frequency of a disease organism.

       The basic Rife  device is composed of a signal generator that is set
       to produce SQUARE WAVES.  Square waves  are  rich in harmonics which
       tend to assist in the destruction of the targeted disease organisms.

       This square wave output is attached to the input of  just  about any
       impedance matching transformer  (as  used for speaker systems).  The
       output of the impedance matching transformer can be connected to the
       body in many different ways.

       Of these, some methods that have been used are :

          1)  take two buckets of water  (with  a  bit  of  salt  added  to
              enhance conductivity), place one foot in each bucket and turn
              on the machine

                                      Page 1




          2)  take  two  cylinders  of stainless steel, turn on the machine
              and hold one tightly in each hand
          3)  use two brainwave type electrodes or just two discs of metal,
              place them across the area  to  be  treated  and  turn on the
              machine
          4)  use one metal disc and one metal cylinder  as  the  "ground",
              hold the  cylinder  in  one  hand and place the disc over the
              area to be treated, turn on the machine

       A more advanced unit includes a gating circuit which basically turns
       the output square wave off and on  at a rate of 4 cycles per second.
       Experiments in the  destruction  of paramecium and  other  organisms
       have shown this to be much more effective.

       It is quite   fascinating  to  observe  the  destruction  of  micro-
       organisms.  In practical experiments,  the  electrodes  were  placed
       across a microscope slide which contained a sample  of "dirty" water
       from a puddle  in  the  driveway.   The  output  from  an oscillator
       generating a square wave signal was  sent  across this sample.  When
       viewed through a microscope, various micro-organisms  could  be seen
       swimming through the  water  (this  was  magnified  through  a video
       attachment for TV viewing).

       As the oscillator  frequency  was   slowly   increased,  at  certain
       frequencies, you could see the paramecium stop and start to vibrate,
       at one of those frequencies, the amplitude of the signal  was slowly
       increased.  The target  organism  began  to  swell  and  become more
       translucent as if something was squashing  it  (possibly  the  slide
       cover, yet other organisms were not so affected).

       As it continued  to  expand, it reached a point which  we  call  the
       "elastic recovery limit"  of  the membrane.  At that point, multiple
       ruptures occurred in  the membrane  causing  the  expulsion  of  the
       internals of the  organism  to dissipate into the ambient  solution.
       Bottomline, the organism went through a controlled explodion.  Quite
       fascinating.

       This research is  to  our  knowledge  original  and was done by Rick
       Sheppard of Dallas.  Rick has worked  and been in close contact with
       John Crane, one of Rife's research partners.  We were priviledged to
       see Rick's early experiments and be kept informed of others.

       These advanced experiments  have  included  the  broadcast  of  RIFE
       frequencies through a   modulated   UV   light   and  through  radio
       frequencies using a Citizens Band  (CB)  transmitter.  Both of these
       methods were found  to  work  as  well  as direct contact  with  the
       electrodes.

       If you choose  to  experiment with the RIFE frequencies, PLEASE take
       EXTREME care, especially with the exposure time and amplitude.

       Experiments have shown that 15 minutes  per day is quite sufficient.
       Some people do  15  minutes  every three days.  As  noted  in  Bob's
       account below, the  body must have time to dispose of the toxins and
       byproducts from the "exploded" disease organism.

       One word of explanation, some of the  disease frequencies consist of
       one or more  frequencies  for a given disease.  When  so  specified,
       these should be  sequentially  applied,  that  is, the first one for
       about 3 to 5 minutes, followed by the second, third, etc. each of

                                      Page 2




       about 3 to  5 minute duration.  The idea is that successive "shells"
       of the disease organism must be  "accessed"  to  be  subject  to the
       particular frequency in effect at that time.

       Also, in papers you find on KeelyNet referring to RIFE  frequencies,
       you will note  the  use  of  the term RIFE FREQUENCY (indicating ONE
       frequency) for a given disease.  Some diseases require MORE than ONE
       and so each disease grouping of frequencies  where  applicable  will
       come under the generic term of RIFE FREQUENCY.

       We have word that the RIFE frequency as determined for AIDS is quite
       dangerous.  Specifically, AIDS  patients exposed to  this  frequency
       became extensively dehydrated  and died from continual diarrhea.  We
       think the duration  of  treatment   possibly   in  addition  to  the
       amplitude of the signals was the cause of this.  In one way, it is a
       positive report since  a  definite  effect  was witnessed  with  the
       massive physical changes ONLY with exposure to the RIFE frequency.

       It simply goes  to show that you should crawl before you try to fly,
       that is, keep the duration and amplitude  on  the  lower levels.  If
       you get no  observable effects, then increase it  a  notch  and  try
       again.  BE CAREFUL!

       We are particularly  impressed by the use of the Scientology derived
       purification method using distilled  or pure water and a sauna.  One
       further suggestion to help purify the blood is the use of the herbal
       tea, ESSIAC.  That  formula  and sources for the tea  are  found  on
       KeelyNet in a  file listed as ESSIAC1.ASC.  This herbal tea contains
       three herbs that help the body to purify the blood.

       Don't hurt yourself, don't run afoul of the medical establishment by
       trying this on others (do it to YOURSELF ONLY) and if you experience
       pain or other discomfort, discontinue  your  experiments and ask for
       advice or seek  qualified  medical help.  You could  quite  possibly
       have other problems which conflict with Rife treatments.

       Good luck and we would appreciate hearing of your experiences in the
       form of messages,  a file or a letter to our mailing address, if you
       so allow, we will place your experiences  into  a  master file which
       might be of assistance to other experimenters.  THANKS!...>>> Jerry

       Subject: Use of Rife Generator
       Folder : A, "Public Mail"

       Hi all,
            Just wanted to share an interesting experience with the Rife
       Generator. Some time  back  I  developed a lump in my left leg. Now,
       what this lump was, I didn't want  to know. It was very painful, and
       after several weeks of not going away, I decided to  take  the cheap
       route and not go to the doctor, but instead went to a friend who has
       a Rife generator.  (well,  you  could  say  a cheap signal generator
       attached to an impedance matching  transformer attached to two metal
       plates on the floor).
            He made sure I understood that I was treating MYSELF, borrowing
       his equipment. He didn't touch the equipment while I was there.
            I did all the known frequencies to do with cancer type

                                      Page 3




       diseases, and I  left. The next day I had one hell of a headache and
       generally felt kind of ill. This feeling  didn't go away for about a
       week and I got a little worried. Oh, also the lump  was  diminishing
       too.
            I figured  what  happened was that I'd killed a little too much
       of the cancer too fast. You're supposed  to  do it for a few minutes
       not an hour like I did! So all these toxins were floating  around in
       my system, and  boy  the headaches felt like my brain was half dead!
       So I had to find a way to eliminate  the  toxins  from  my  body and
       fast.
            I'd heard  that the Russians at the Cherynoble  accident  could
       find no system  to remove more than 1% radiation from the body. What
       does that have to do with toxins  from  dead  cancer  cells? Well, I
       figured that partices  become radioactive and float  around  in  the
       body and kill it off. Same as dead cancer cells. So I knew also that
       the Russians found that the Scientology purification program removed
       40-60% radiation from  the  body.  After all other systems failed to
       remove more than 1%. So I have a small  sauna in my closet, actually
       an electric quartz  heater.  I  used it for five days  every  night,
       following the purification program instructions.
            The headache disappeared on the second or third day. The lump
       which was much smaller began to break the surface of the skin and
       "Leak". At the end of the 5th day I stopped as I felt fine and since
       then, about a  month,  there is only a very tiny spot under the skin
       that feels more solid than the rest  of  the flesh. It isn't painful
       and is very  hard to find. Originally it was about  the  size  of  a
       quarter or a little larger.
            If any of you wish to try this on yourself be sure you do it
       yourself, as I  did.  Someone  else  doing  it  on  you  constitutes
       practicing medicine without a license!  (I  mean the Rife Generator)
       As for the  purification program, anyone can drink  lots  of  water,
       take vitamins, excercise, and sweat in the sauna! Just don't call it
       medicine!
            I am afraid my friend left town and the frequencies we used are
       lost, but there are lots of people around disseminating that
       information I am  sure.  The  purification  program is laid out in a
       book called "Clear Body, Clear Mind" by L. Ron Hubbard.
