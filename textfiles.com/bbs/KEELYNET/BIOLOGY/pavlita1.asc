       This note is  intended  to  draw  attention  to  the  work of Robert
       Pavlita and his experiments in bio-energy. Feedback is very much
       wanted. Contact details appear at the end.

       A pleasing result  of  the enormous  changes  occurring  in  eastern
       Europe is the exposure of developments and ideas hitherto hidden
       from the attention of the west.

       The work of Robert Pavlita, a Czech scientist working for fifty
       years in almost total obscurity, is a good example.

       Pavlita built an extraordinary array of what he called  Psychotronic
       Generators, bizarre but  exquisite metal-work creations - each about
       the size of  a  paperback book -  which  serve  as  "batteries"  for
       certain kinds of psychic energy.

       In his experiments, Pavlita demonstrated that the Generators can
       be used to achieve an array of results:

          1)  causing magnetic-like behavior in such substances  as  paper,
              ceramics and lead;
          2)  purifying aniline solutions; making a flywheel spin at will;
          3)  transferring energy in a variety of ways with the only input
              being the energy of the mind.

       The list is  long: the key thing is that each of these events occurs
       through a combination of thought (brain activity) and Generators. No
       special inherent skills  are needed  by  the  operator  -  Pavlita's
       research points to  these exercises in Bio-Energy  being  doable  by
       anyone.

       It amounts, in  his  view,  to  a  fundamentally  different  form of
       energy, one which requires a paradigm shift. It has to be emphasized
       that Pavlita's work has always been  based on science and scientific
       methodology.

       Unfortunately, Czechoslovakia's turbulent history has worked against
       Pavlita. The greatest attention it received was from  the  Czech and
       Soviet secret police,  who  kept him and his research bottled up and
       isolated for most of the last fifty years.

       As far as we can tell, there are only a small handful of mentions of
       his work in any literature. Dr Stanley Krippner, who travelled to


                                      Page 1





       Czechoslovakia to meet Pavlita in the early 1960's, devotes a few
       chapters to Pavlita in his book FUTURE SCIENCE: LIFE ENERGIES AND
       THE PHYSICS OF PARANORMAL PHENOMENA (John White and Stanley
       Krippner - Doubleday/Anchor) and concludes:

            "...After spending  three hours with Pavlita... I was impressed
            by his  devotion  to his work.  I  am  aware  that  alternative
            explanations to  his  demonstrations  exist  (hidden   magnets,
            electrostatic effects  etc.)  It  is also possible that Pavlita
            and his daughter unwittingly  have used their own psychokinetic
            abilities to create the effects rather than tapping  sources of
            "biological energy"  common  to  everyone. Only future research
            will indicate  whether  the  psychotronic  generators  are  the
            scientific breakthrough that his supporters suspect."

       At about the  same  time,  a  reference appears in another  book  to
       interest evidently having  been  taken  in Pavlita's research by the
       United States Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA).

       Then in 1987, the Central Research  Institute  for  Physics  of  the
       Hungarian Academy of   Sciences  conducted  a  long   and   rigorous
       examination of Pavlita's Psychotronic Generators and his ideas about
       bio-energy. Their findings  are  abstracted  in a 28-page report (in
       English) which says:

            "Magnetic anomalies have been investigated and it is shown that
            the magnetization  curves  of  [unreadable]  and  ferromagnetic
            materials may change temporarily due to biological  activation.
            The apparatus, the method of the activation and the measurement
            procedure are  briefly  described  and a number of test results
            are included for various materials."

       In 1989, following the Velvet Revolution  which brought Vaclav Havel
       to power, a former Czech emigre now living in Australia  returned to
       Czechoslovakia and established  a  close  personal  connection  with
       Pavlita. The Australian  is  passionately   interested  in  exposing
       Pavlita's ideas to worldwide attention and having them  exploited in
       the various fields   of   relevance:   medicine,  computer  science,
       environmental control and others.

       He formed an international foundation  dedicated  to  spreading  the
       word about Pavlita.  Last spring, he brought a group  of  Australian
       film-makers to Czechoslovakia  to  make  a  one-hour video about the
       eighty-year old and his life and times.  The  video was completed in
       December 1991 and a private showing has been organized to take place
       in New York City in the next few days.

       Pavlita's diaries and  papers,  which  are copious  and  exquisitely
       documented, are being  stored  on optical disks at present, and work
       has commenced in translating some  of  it  from  Czech.  The  entire
       collection of Psychotronic Generators is currently  being catalogued
       and documented, and  a  small group of amateur researchers have been
       training themselves in Pavlita's  techniques,  especially  in how to
       "charge" a Psychotronic Generator.

       At this stage,  the foundation is interested in doing  a  number  of
       things. First -  to  let  people  know  about Pavlita's findings and
       research, and to start some public discussion about its implications


                                      Page 2





       for science, industry  and  health.  Then  -  to  create  the proper
       framework for additional research and development.

       We are interested  in  trying  to identify  strategic  relationships
       which will enable  the Pavlita group to move forward.  If  you  have
