                            Russians were not the First

       I want to  comment  briefly on the article Russians Photograph Life-
       and Death (FATE, September, 1962).

       In his book, Physical and Super-normal  Phenomena,  published by The
       Marlowe Press of Chicago, Dr. Paul Joire gives the  history  of work
       done by various  investigators  of  biological  emanations,  such as
       effluvia from plant and animal organisms.   Some  of  these antedate
       the work of the Kirlians of Russia by 75 years.  Among them are:

          The work of M. Albert Jounot on "Effluvia of the  Gaze,  Effluvia
          from the  Hand Influenced by Thought, and Photographic Experiment
          on the Relation Between Human and Terrestrial Polarity."

          The work of Commandmant Darget  of  Tours  (a photographer in the
          French army)  on  "The  projection of the brain  of  a  calf,  in
          section appearance, which had been slaughtered, on a photographic
          plate, which a butcher...had held on its head."

          Also, the   photography  of  the  zones  of  contraction  of  the
          "perispirit" of a plant (fern)  which  had  been  cut a half hour
          previously.  The phenomena shown were threefold :

                 1)  exact portrait of the plant,
                 2)  effluvia thrown off from each leaflet,
                 3)  zones of contraction  during the suffering.

          After it  died,  Darget  took  the  fern and placed  it  under  a
          photographic plate, leaving it there two days as he had done when
          the plant  was  alive.   "Nothing was obtained, not the slightest
          imprint."

       I recommend Dr. Joire's book.  It  will open the eyes of readers who
       otherwise may think that the Kirlians have made a new discovery.

       Vangard notes....

          Recall the Biological Transmutations of Kervran?   Kervran  found
          that living tissues were able to transmute one element to another
          if deemed necessary to survival or natural function of the

                                      Page 1





          organism.

          This must  necessarily involve the release or capture of neutrons
          which results  in  radioactivity.    Radiation   definitely  fogs
          photographic plates.

          It is of interest that the dying animal or plant somehow puts off
          such energy.   Ritual magic using animal and human  sacrifice  as
          well as  descriptions  of  mass  killers  refer  to the "rush" of
          energy felt when the victim expires.

          Of course, in magic, the capture,  focus  and redirection of such
          energies is  what is intended to achieve a desired  result.   The
          energy released  from  intentional  murder at the hands of a mass
          killer could possibly serve to amplify his desire to kill.

          The question here is : Does the  living  and  undamaged body emit
          radiation sufficient to naturally fog or etch photographic films?

          Is that  energy  amplified  or parametrically upgraded  when  the
          organism is damaged or dying?

          The experiment of Ted Serios in thought photography indicate that
          a sustained and focussed image can positively affect photographic
          film.

          After all,  it  is  only silver halides which are "rearranged" to
          fit the image.  Most of the photos  are  not  that well resolved,
          though they  most  definitely  show understandable  patterns  and
          shapes.

          We would like to study a copy of the book or documents.  We would
          greatly appreciate a photocopy of it, if anyone reading this file
          might come  across  one  or all of the documents.  We will gladly
          pay duplication and mailing costs.
