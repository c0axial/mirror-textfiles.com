          The following  was  sent  to us here at KeelyNet in the form of a
       photocopied paper with very fine print.  It follows what we believe,
          that most complicated systems  or  problems  result from what are
         essentially simple, easily correctable problems.   This holds true
       for medical, health, free energy, anti-grav and the host of subjects
          that interest  us  here  at KeelyNet.  In science, this is called
         reductionism, reducing things down  to  their most basic form.  We
       urge you to pass this file along to medical practitioners and others
                     interested in the base causes of disease.

                      HCL (dilute Hydrochloric Acid) Therapy
                                  author unknown

       In general terms  it  could  be  said that the response  of  a  sick
       individual to accept   the  therapeutic  measures  whether  they  be
       serums, vaccines, X-ray, radium, surgery,  intravenous  medications,
       blood transfusions, glandular therapies, re-mineralization,  vitamin
       therapies, hyperpyrexias, refrigeration, osteopathic or chiropractic
       manipulations, the new wonder drugs, and so forth, the best we could
       say of those is that they are of a hit or miss proposition.

       To date, no branch of the healing arts has as yet found a logical or
       truly scientific basis  on  which to study the cause or treatment of
       functional chronic or  degenerative   disease.    The   practitioner
       frustrated by lack  of  satisfactory  physical and  mental  response
       among chronic patients   has   been   skimping  in  his  efforts  to
       rehabilitate them.  However,  he  can  and  does  justify  his  mere
       routine consideration with the thought that the acutely ill need all
       of his time  and attention and that the chronics whom  he  generally
       dismisses as hypochondriacs  will manage somehow to get along.  This
       attitude for sometime has deeply concerned  both  medical and public
       health men who are in a position to know the facts.   Why  is  there
       this appalling and  utter  disregard  for  treatment  of the chronic
       patient?

       The medical man claims dogmatically,  "I  am  the true physician and
       mine is the  correct  approach  of  therapeusis."    However,  major
       aspects of the general public are continually faced with incompetent
       diagnosis such as  just  plain  nerves,  or neurasthenia, or nervous
       digestion, or exhaustion of nervous energy, or nervous dyspepsia, or
       nervous stomach, or hypochondriasis, or psychoneurosis, of essential
       hypertension, or general asthenia,  or  imaginitis, and let it go at
       that.  There is  no  question  but  that American medicine  and  its
       allied healing arts have utterly failed in their mission.  We have

       for some reason  allowed  our  medical  practice  to lag at least 50
       years behind the  times and are  not  only  content  with,  but  are
       insisting upon, the same old unnatural therapeutic approaches to the
       chronic disorders of  age.  Adequate medical care,  the  traditional
       American dream is not even obtainable by the very rich!

       We must attribute  this  failure  to  the  fact that in the study of
       chronic and degenerative disease,  for  too  long  a  time,  medical
       science has passionately and blindly concerned itself with the study
       of end results  without due consideration of first,  the  manner  in
       which your health   comes   about,  and  second,  the  physiological
       alterations that are occasioned long before tissue pathology sets in
       and thirdly, the environmental conditions  which have contributed to
       its development and  fourthly, that the disease is  not  a  separate
       entity or process  all  by  itself but rather that it effects and is
       effected in turn by the organism as a whole.

       The pathological anatomy, the visible  or  palpable  changes  in the
       structure that is found in the organs and tissues of  the  body was,
       and still is,  the foundation of practice of those who have not kept
       abreast of the changes that modern  science  has brought about.  And
       yet there is a basic phenomenon which occurs over and  over again in
       the practice lives of physicians and healers.  Every practitioner at
       one time or  another has seen or heard about one or more persons ill
       with an acute disease hopelessly  beyond  human  aid  or  of  others
       afflicted with an  incurable chronic disease to have  been  able  in
       some inexplicable manner  to  reverse the vital processess of injury
       and repair, action and reaction so  that  the  body  having acquired
       natural immunity, or  shall  we  say  having  increased  the  body's
       resistance, there results  an increasing cellular or tissue reaction
       followed by destruction  of  the invader,  restoration  of  balance,
       repair of all   injured  and  diseased  tissues  and   a   seemingly
       miraculous recovery takes place.

       As yet no  one  has  come  forward  with  an intelligent explanation
       except to call them spontaneous recoveries, or better yet MIRACLES.

       In search for a remedy that would stimulate the reticulo-endothelial
       systems of the  body, I performed  a  number  of  experiments.   One
       experiment was to introduce a number of substances  under the cover-
       glass slip of  the  microscope slide while observing the red, white,
       and bacterial cells under dark field microscopy.

       I experimented with serial dilutions  of  EDTA  as  a  chelator  and
       hydrochloric acid (HCL) as a reducer.  Once I had the dilutions down
       to the point where red cell damage did not occur visibly  I made the
       discovery that I was looking for.

       Two things were obvious by direct vision of the infected human blood
       before my eyes:

           1)  The EDTA dissolved the bacteria.
           2)  The  hydrochloric  acid  increased the activity of the white
               blood cell.

       The white cell observation was astounding  and led me to a search of
       the worlds literature on the use of hydrochloric acid  in  the human
       body.  The reports that came in were old but fascinating, I had no


                                      Page 2





       alternative but to  begin to give myself the treatment and watch the
       changes in my own blood.

       A number of excellent reports were  made  by  Drs. B. Ferguson, W.B.
       Guy, I. Howell,  W.G.  Brymer, M.A. Craig, A.M. Allen,  F.J.  James,
       O.P. Sweatt, R.L.  Sills  and  E.D. Jackson, and perhaps the largest
       concentration to the world's literature was by R.R. Garcia.

       It was on the strength of their efforts  and  the  years of clinical
       work done by  my  mentor  Dr.  Black  that  I  made   this  profound
       discovery.

       When hydrochloric acid  is  injected  into  the body in very dilute,
       physiologic amounts, the white blood  cell  systems  increase  their
       activity, the blood pH returns to normal regardless of whether it is
       too acid or too alkaline and the number of white cells increase.

       What follows are some random thoughts on this subject.

       The most obvious clinical observation in the treatment  of  an acute
       infectious disease with  the  use  of  hydrochloric  acid  is that a
       greater phagocytic activity is imparted  to  the  white cells by the
       injection of the  dilute  solution  of hydrochloric  acid  into  the
       bloodstream, and that   the   activity   varies  in  intensity  with
       different individuals.  It proved  to  be a very important factor in
       the improvement of the state of resistance of the organism.

       Leukocytes and phagocytosis, important as they are,  are  but a link
       in a chain  of  events  of  its defense mechanism to combat disease,
       whether it be  acute,  chronic or  degenerative.   As  part  of  the
       natural mechanism of  defense  and  repair  we  can   make   several
       observations in the  acute  disease.   The body must marshall all of
       the forces of  the  defensive mechanism  in  order  to  sustain  the
       successful struggle in   the   favorable  cases.   The   unfavorable
       conditions are increasing  injury  and  diminishing reaction.  These
       must be changed to increasing reaction  and  diminishing injury with
       destruction and ultimate repair of the injured and diseased tissue.

       In order to  accomplish this effectively there must  take  place  an
       adequate febrile reaction to bring about attenuation of the invading
       pathogenic microorganisms, rapid    elimination    of    accumulated
       bacterial and normal production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach.
       There must be an increased presence  in  the bloodstream as the acid
       responsible for the maintenance of a normal pH.   Obviously  in  the
       treatment of any   disease   process   we  must  do  away  with  all
       predisposing conditions such as malnutrition  and  local  infection.
       We must bring  about  elimination of all accumulated  bacterial  and
       metabolic poisons.  There  must  take  place  restoration  of tissue
       susceptibility, the production  of  hydrochloric  acid  whether  too
       much, or too  little,  or  none  at  all,  and its presence  in  the
       bloodstream must be   restored   to   normal.    In  other  words  a
       physiological balance must be restored.  It is reasonable to believe
       that the acid-base balance of the  blood  is  maintained through the
       acid cells and  since hydrochloric acid is the only  inorganic  acid
       normally made in  the  body and that it is to this acid specifically
       that we must attribute the apparent  acidic  response  of  the white
       cells.  When this  condition  of  physiologic  balance   exists  the
       individual is in  the  state  of  absolute  immunity.  He is in good
       health and in the possession of a normal pH in the bloodstream and

                                      Page 3





       other fluids in  the  body.   The  normal pH in itself is what could
       constitute what is generally known  as  a natural immunity.  Certain
       organs and tissues possess an ability to modify their  own  immunity
       make up or  local defense mechanism.  These seem to be governed by a
       normal production of HCL in the  stomach  and  a  normal  pH  in the
       bloodstream.  Consider continuity  of  the skin covering,  with  its
       acid mantle, the  acidity  of  the  stomach  contents,  the  defense
       mechanisms within the nasal passages,  the secretions and linings of
       the eyes, mouth, intestinal tract, female and male  genital  urinary
       tracts, and at times the presence of specific immunity.

       It is well  known  that practically everyone is harboring at various
       times in the membranes of the throat,  mouth  and  nasal  tract  the
       germs of influenza, pneumonia, scarlet fever, croop,  measles, mumps
       and other contagions  without  becoming  a  victim  of  the  disease
       itself.  It is also known that in order that infection shall develop
       it is not only necessary that the  bacteria  grow in the tissues but
       it is necessary  that  they injure the tissue and  thus  induce  the
       reaction of disease.   This  they do at times by producing injurious
       substances in sufficient quantities, that is, bacterial forms.

       The presence of a normal production  of  hydrochloric  acid  and its
       presence in the  bloodstream and other fluids of  the  body  is  the
       agent responsible for  the  acidity  of  the  white  cells  and  the
       maintenance of a normal pH.  It is the agent that renders the fluids
       and tissues of the body bactericidal  and  unfavorable  as  a media.
       The more the  white cells are maintained in a phagocytic  state  the
       better is the natural immunity.

           (HCL and  EDTA  have  both  been  used  with  DMSO  to get these
            substances in the blood stream without the usual shots.
            DMSO can often be obtained  in  Health  Food  storeas  and  Vet
            Suppliers.  Diluted   with   50%  sterile  water   some   treat
            themselves.....  Such  treatment  CANNOT BE CONDONED of course,
            and any medical problems are  best  taken  care  of  by private
            physicians....G)

       An infection can go in only so many ways.  It can either be aborted,
       arrested, or carried on a successful termination.   In the treatment
       of all functional   metabolic,   endocrine,  allergic,  chronic  and
       degenerative disease, once  the  production   of  hydrochloric  acid
       becomes restored to  normal there takes place a restoration  of  the
       normal acid base  balance, reversal of the vital processes, followed
       by repair of all injured and diseased  tissues  with  restoration of
       good health.  When the production of hydrochloric acid  falls short,
       a fact easily demonstrable by laboratory techniques and which may be
       observed to take  place  at  birth or at any time during our natural
       expanse of life,   the  conditions   of   hyper-chlorhydria,   hypo-
       chlorhydria or achlorhydria   take   place.   This   deficiency   in
       hydrochloric acid production   may  be  temporary  or  permanent  in
       character, and may be brought about  by  one  or  more  predisposing
       factors such as  malnutrition,  focal infection, chronic  poisoning,
       exposure, fatigue, emotional distress, shock and so forth.

       A better understanding of the concept of disease and immunity can be
       had by evaluating  a  few  of  the  things  that  we are known about
       immunity.  First of all, antibodies  are  specific  as the organisms
       which have called  them  into  existence.  Second, the  bactericidal
       power manifested by blood serum of man or animal toward all

                                      Page 4





       microorganisms outside the  body is not dependent on the presence or
       absence of specific antibodies.   Thirdly,  the  presence  of immune
       bodies does not convey absolute immunity against a  specific disease
       and fourth, when  invasion  takes place and the reactions of disease
       manifest, the disease may be mild  although  not infrequently may be
       severe irrespective of  the  presence or absence of  immune  bodies.
       The question that  follows  is how can we explain the inherent value
       of specific immunity and the manner  in which it affords protection?
       Why does this protection fail so frequently?  It  is  possible  that
       the it comes  into  play  only when the latter has failed to prevent
       invasion?  The leukocytes, or the  white  blood  cells,  are factors
       which aid or  supplement the natural immunity.  At  times,  however,
       when the virulence of the invading pathogen and the influx of toxins
       into the bloodstream  is  of  such a preponderant nature, the immune
       bodies become overpowered.  The excess  toxins  not only paralyze or
       shock the white  cells  into  inactivity but they also  bring  about
       tissue injury and the resultant reactions of disease.  Many times in
       doing dark field  microscopy  of  individual's  blood,  I have found
       massive accumulations of L-form bacteria  and  yet  the  white blood
       cells are completely dormant, non-motile, non-phagocytic and huddled
       up in a little ball doing nothing.

       Good health and  the  presence of absolute immunity  depend  on  the
       existence of a  normal  production  of  hydrochloric  acid  and  its
       presence in the bloodstream and other  fluids of the body.  When the
       HCL production falls  short,  and  a  progressive  diminution  takes
       place, we find  a  loss of absolute immunity, a decreasing degree of
       tissue susceptibility, an imbalance  of  blood  chemistry,  and poor
       digestion and assimilation.  This is the starting point  of  general
       ill-health and malnutrition.  It is a logical assumption that a lack
       of sufficient minerals in the daily diet must of necessity give rise
       to a deficiency  in  the  hydrochloric acid production.  It is known
       that certain salts, such as potassium,  are  needed  by  the  glands
       responsible for its production.

       It is also  known that when the hydrochloric acid  production  falls
       short the required  amount  necessary to maintain the acidity of the
       white cells and  the  acid-base  balance  becomes  insufficient  and
       hydrogen chloride eventually  vanishes  from the circulation.   When
       hydrogen chloride disappears  from  the  circulation some other acid
       must take its place immediately in  order  to maintain the pH of the
       circulating fluids.  The  acid  wastes assume the role  of  hydrogen
       chloride in the  blood  chemistry.  This is followed by an imbalance
       of the blood chemistry.

       The acid wastes can not be thrown  off as quickly as they are formed
       so they begin to accumulate in the fluids and tissues  of  the  body
       with the resultant  struggle between these and the alkaline reserve.
       The result is a depletion of the latter.

       Functional disorders of a metabolic,  endocrine  and allergic nature
       and the condition of acidosis become manifest.  The person loses his
       natural immunity and  is  highly  prone to develop  focal  infection
       followed by acute disease.  In this depleted condition they lack the
       necessary reserve to destroy the invading microorganisms completely.

       It has been  well  established that in all cases of malnutrition the
       condition of acidosis is always present.   There follows a reduction
       of physiologic functions and the EVER INCREASING accumulation of

                                      Page 5





       acid metabolic wastes  in  the  bloodstream.   The hydrogen chloride
       production becomes diminished.  The  hydrogen ions necessary for the
       maintenance of a   normal  pH  fall  short  and  sooner   or   later
       hydrochloric acid is  replaced by the waste acids in the maintenance
       of the acid base balance.  These acid  wastes include carbonic acid,
       diacetic acid, lactic  acid, acetic acids, fatty acids,  uric  acid,
       etc.  These acid  wastes  however,  are abnormal constituents of the
       bloodstream and will  act  as  a  disruptor  of  the  natural  blood
       chemistry.

       When hydrochloric acid vanishes from the circulation  hypersecretion
       of hydrochloric acid  takes  place  in the gastric cells responsible
       for its production.    A   condition   known   as   hyperchlorhydria
       supervenes.  The excessive secretion of hydrogen chloride  is but an
       effort on the  part  of  nature  to  restore  its  presence  in  the
       bloodstream by sheer force of numbers.  Sooner or later however, the
       gastric cells begin to tire and the  component  chemistry  begin  to
       dwindle.  Thus the production of hydrogen chloride  begins  to  fall
       short.  Focal infection  pours  a  continuous  stream  of  bacterial
       poisons into the  blood  stream  bringing  about  a  diminution  and
       ultimately a disappearance of hydrogen chloride from the circulation
       with a resultant loss of phagocytic activity.  There then follows an
       extension of the  primary  focus to one or more parts  of  the  body
       creating newer disease processes and newer foci of infection and the
       probability of a  chrnoic  poisoning such as lead, arsenic, monoxide
       gas, narcotics, alcohol, and so accumulation of the absorbed poisons
       plus the acid  metabolic  wastes causes  a  resultant  condition  of
       acidemia.  There follows    a   deficiency   of   HCL    production,
       malnutrition, loss of  tissue  susceptibility  and  thus the general
       causation formulation that leads  to  the  chronic  and degenerative
       disease.  Recent studies in Germany and in this country  demonstrate
       that cancer, diabetes,    acute    infection,    neurosis,   passive
       congestions, gastric catarrh,   severe   anemia,   arteriosclerosis,
       hypertension, chemical poisoning,   affections    of    the   heart,
       neoplastic growths, metabolic   and   endocrine   disorders,  senile
       insanities, dyspepsia, chronic ulcers  of  the stomach and duodenum,
       cholecystitis, appendicitis, duodenitis, worry, anxiety  and pyloric
       obstruction show pronounced   changes   in   the  hydrochloric  acid
       production.  Too much, too little or none at all.

       Statistical surveys have  been  made   of  the  gastric  acidity  of
       patients of all ages and it was found that 25-30% of  those over the
       age of 45  showed  no  free  or  combined  hydrochloric  acid.   The
       incidence of achlorhydria in the  whole  series  of  more than 3,000
       patients examined was  more  than  10%.   We  know  that  pepsin  is
       inactive unless a   considerable  amount  of  hydrochloric  acid  is
       present.  We also know that very few  bacteria  can survive the acid
       conditions in the  stomach  and  that  the  gastric juice  partially
       sterilizes the food preventing putrifaction during the gastric phase
       of digestion.  Without  acid  in  the  stomach  the  benefit of this
       action is not obtained.

       Let us consider the protective agencies  of  the animal organism but
       instead of talking about antibodies, vaccines, antitoxins,  immunity
       of the blood,  dietary  regimens,  etc. let us go to rock bottom and
       consider the very essential mineral  elements  of  which our body is
       composed.  It is generally believed that organic life  began  in the
       saline ocean many  eons  ago  and  that the chemical formula of that
       ocean, of the blood serum, and the temperature of the body have not

                                      Page 6





       changed materially since  that  time.   That  the ocean is generally
       always free from corruption no matter  how  many  of its animals die
       within it, is  probably  due  to  its  chlorine  content.   Chlorine
       related not only  to  sodium  chloride  but also to the chlorides of
       magnesium, calcium, and other minerals present.

       Let us study the part that chlorine  plays  in the digestion of food
       and its absorption  into the body tissues.  Chlorine  may  be  found
       free as hydrochloric  acid  in  the  gastric  juice or combined with
       albumin in albuminosis or it may be found united with sodium chiefly
       in the fluids  of  the  body  and  with  potassium  in  the  solids.
       Potassium was also   found   as   a   chloride  by   preference   in
       morphological elements like  blood  corpuscles,  muscle  cells, etc.
       Calcium chloride is  found  in the  gastric  juice  as  a  secondary
       product.  Hydrochloric acid   favors   the  excretion   of   calcium
       phosphates.

       The normal gastric  juice in man contains some two to three parts of
       hydrochloric acid per thousand.   In  healthy  dogs  five  parts  is
       found.

       It is curious  that a healthy dog can eat septic  meat  and  if  its
       stomach is opened one half hour later the foul odor of the meat will
       be found sterile.   The  acidity  and  the germicidal quality of the
       chorides perform this action.  Too  often;  however  acidity  of the
       stomach is not due to an excess of hydrochloric acid  but  rather to
       an excess of  lactic acid and if content of the stomach is alkaline,
       oxibuteric, diacetic and other acids  due  to putrefaction processes
       are present.  What is true of lactic acid is also true  of the other
       organic acids such  as butyric, formic, and acetic, all of which are
       especially abundant where there is  stagnation  of  gastric contents
       due to pyloric obstruction.  Hydrochloric acid is  the  ONLY  normal
       inorganic acid in  the  body's  economy.   All  other  acids such as
       lactic, carbonic, uric,  etc.  are   WASTE  PRODUCTS  eliminated  as
       quickly as possible.  The normal acid would be the  most  likely one
       to accomplish this end.

       If we have  too great an excess of carbonic acid we have COMA, as in
       diabetes or later stages of pneumonia.

       If the uric acid is too high we have  deposits  in  the  valves, the
       arteries and articular surfaces.

       When the hydrochloric acid content of the gastric juice is deficient
       or absent we must expect grave results which will inevitably  appear
       in the human metabolism.

       First of all  we  shall  see an increasing and gradual starvation of
       the mineral elements  in  the  food   supply.    The  food  will  be
       incompletely digested and failure of assimilation must occur.

       Secondly, a septic  process  of  the tissues will appear,  pyorrhea,
       dyspepsia, nephritis, appendicitis,   boils,  abscesses,  pneumonia,
       etc. will become  increasingly manifest.   Again  a  normal  gastric
       fluid demands activity  of  the  gallbladder  contents  and  of  the
       pancreas for neutralization.   Deficiency of normal acids leads to a
       stagnation of these organs, leading to diabetes and gallstones.

       In the absence of or in a great deficiency of hydrochloric acid we

                                      Page 7





       find a rise   in   the  multitudinous  degenerative  reaction  which
       prepares the way to all forms of  degenerative  disease.   What then
       are the causes  of hydrochloric acid disappearance  in  the  gastric
       fluid following eating of food?

       We have discovered   that   hydrochloric   acid   secretion  may  be
       completely SUPPRESSED by emotion  or  worry  and  in  these  days of
       emotional worry and  distress, loss of homes, business,  income  and
       monies, we may well fear that in the near future a great increase of
       degenerative diseases such  as  cancer,  nephritis, cardiac, nervous
       and mental afflictions must assuredly  occur  unless  man  can  rise
       above worldly affairs  and  find  the  true  and  only   source   of
       contentment and happiness.

       When one considers  that  this  normal  acid,  hydrochloric acid, is
       derived from the tissues of the stomach  or gastric membrane and not
       directly from the sodium chloride of the blood, one readily realizes
       that an ample  supply  of sodium chloride alone is  insufficient  to
       restore normal gastric  acidity.   Rather,  that  it  is  instead  a
       complex process.  The sodium atom is picked up and combined with the
       phosphorous atom giving  rise to  sodium  phosphate  which  must  be
       eliminated thus allowing  the  chlorine atom to be  set  free.   The
       chlorine atom combines  with  the  potassium  and other minerals and
       albumins in the gastric acid and is  made ready for future digestive
       functions.

       In my estimation it is not in the life of the cell  that  the secret
       to malignancies is  to be found but rather in THE MEDIA IN WHICH THE
       CELL LIVES and the nerves that control it.

       Cell growth is materially influenced  by  the  nerve  centers of the
       spinal cord.  This  is  undoubtedly true as is shown  by  the  rapid
       wasting of the  cellular  tissue  when  involvement  of the anterior
       horns of the  spinal  cord  occurs   in   infantile   paralysis  and
       progressive muscular atrophy.  Such being the case,  a toxin causing
       destruction of the   inhibiting  control  of  cell  growth  probably
       present in the  posterior spinal  nerve  centers  would  allow  wild
       growth of cell  life.   Therefore,  neoplasms  in   all   of   their
       multitudinous forms and  a  general failure of the antiseptic powers
       of the blood serum could bring about what is known as malignancy.

       We see cancerous  growths  frequently   appearing   when  the  blood
       pressure is low indicating a beginning failure of the adrenal system
       to combat toxemia.  When hypertension is present the  other group of
       degenerative diseases makes itself evident.

       What can we  conclude?   That  normal hydrochloric acid is necessary
       for complete healthy digestion, that  deficiency  of this acid tends
       to sepsis, suppuration, and general toxemia, that  if  adrenals  are
       inactive degenerative forms  of  disease usually appear, that if the
       adrenals are impaired malignant  neoplasms  may  be  expected,  that
       neoplasms are most likely caused by failure of the  inhibitory nerve
       control probably located  in  the  posterior  nerve  centers  of the
       spinal cord, that emotional worry,  grief,  anxiety,  depression are
       factors to be  considered  as causes of acid deficiency  of  gastric
       fluid and thus  give  rise  to  many  condtions causing degenerative
       processes in alkalescence so commonly found in cancerous disease.

       What is acidosis?  An accumulation of acid or a diminution of the pH

                                      Page 8





       reaction.  But what  acid?   We can glibly say, carbonic acid in the
       blood or lactic acid in the tissue,  uric  acid  in  the  joints and
       blood vessels, lactic,   diacetic,   butyric  in  the   stomach   or
       intestines, etc.  We  may  even visualize hepatic acids in the liver
       but unless we  know  why these acids  appear  in  excess  and  their
       relation to alkalosis,  we shall never be able to  understand  their
       true significance or marshall our remedies effectively against them.

       The only normal  acid  in the animal body is hydrochloric acid found
       in the gastric juice.  All other  acids  are  waste  products.   The
       carbonic acid of  the  breath  is  created by the oxidation  of  the
       lactic acid of the tissues and therefore an excess of lactic acid is
       a failure to  oxidize  this  acid sufficiently.  In diseases such as
       cancer, tuberculosis and fevers, this  failure of complete oxidation
       is present.  The  amino acids are but stages of food  digestion  and
       when present in  excess  show  an  impaired  hepatic  and pancreatic
       function.  The most pernicious form  of  acidosis  is  that produced
       when a stoppage  occurs  in  the  duodenum  or  pylorus.    In  this
       condition the hydrochloric  acid of the gastric fulid disappears and
       other acids such as the acetic, butyric,  and lactic take its place.
       The condition of  chlorine of the blood is usually  diminished,  the
       urea is increased  and  the  capacity  of  the blood to combine with
       carbon dioxide is increased.

       Achlorhydria occurs in some cases  of apparently healthy persons and
       in many cases of gastrointestinal disease.  It is also stressed that
       it appears frequently  in diabetes and with still greater  frequency
       in thyrotoxicosis as well as in certain nonmegalocytic hypochondriac
       anemias.  Absence of  hydrochloric  acid  in  the gastric juice is a
       common symptom in depressive neuroses.   It is frequently associated
       with mental fatigue,  persistent  worry  and  strain  especially  in
       persons with a  congenital  unstable  psyche.  The symptoms are very
       vague, lack of appetite, fullness  after eating, gaseous eructations
       and diarrhea is more common than constipation.  Pain is absent.

       Hydrochloric acid reacts  with the duodenal membrane  to  produce  a
       hormone called secretin  which  stimulates  the  pancreas to release
       insulin, increase the formation of  bile and upgrade the activity of
       the gallbladder.  If  we  were to summarize the sequence  of  events
       occurring as a  result of hydrochloric acid deficiency we would list
       the following:

             Improper digestion
             Fermentation and later putrifaction
             Reduced absorption
             Reduced liver and pancreas function
             Ulcer formation
             Elevated blood sugar
             Reduced oxidation of lactic acid
             Retention of carbon dioxide
             Reduced activity of the white blood cells
             Reduced destruction of bacteria
             Unbalanced mineral levels

       Improper digestion means an unbalanced  assimilation,  an unbalanced
       mineral content of  the  body.   What  are some of the  symptoms  of
       mineral imbalance?

       First a surplus of sodium.  This is following by tissues that are

                                      Page 9





       too watery and  a  tendency  toward edema and asthma, flabby muscles
       and a lack of chlorine.

       A deficiency of calcium means an excess  of  sodium and a deficiency
       of potassium.  Lack of hydrochloric is the main cause  of alkalosis.
       When the cellular  tissue  are too alkaline, the fatty acids tend to
       disintegrate and give off glycerol.   It is interesting to note that
       the Progenitoracae, a   series   of   bacteria   similar    to   the
       Actinomycetales which are  similar to the Microbacteria which is the
       Tuberculosis bacillus, and  that   all  of  these  grow  rapidly  in
       glycerin or sugar medias.  It is also interesting that  fluorine  is
       the most potent  inhibitor  of the enzyme enolase.  When this enzyme
       is inhibited, it causes the intake  of  carbohydrate  to  be shunted
       into the production of Glyceryl instead of being combusted  as  fuel
       energy.  In this   way   industrial  fluoride  pollution  aggravates
       infection.  If an alkaline condition  exists  in  the  body  and  is
       accompanied by a physiologic overcompensation of the  gastric  chief
       cells, an unaware    physician,   or   the   patient   himself   may
       inadvertently dose himself with alkali antacids.  This results in an
       aggravation of the existing alkalosis  and could force the body into
       a compensatory acid production within the tissues.

       The net result of this activity is the production of toxemia and the
       reduction of the final line of defense and repair.

       I have made repeated reference to the inactivity of  the white blood
       cells.

       It is interesting  to note that within two hours of the injection of
       hydrogen chloride intravenously, 32% of the white cells were showing
       pronounced phagocytic activity    and    engulfing   microorganisms.
       Twenty-four hours after  the  injection phagocytic  activity  showed
       that 69% of the white cells were in phagocytic activity.

       The average human  has 7000-8000 white blood cells per milliliter of
       blood.  Projected out for a 160 pound  male with six liters of blood
       we would arrive  at  a  white  blood cell population  of  around  48
       billion cells.  With  the  use  of  hydrochloride  injections we can
       predictably increase the white blood cell population by another 2000
       milliliter and add around 10 billion  more  cells  into  the  fight,
       whatever it may be.

       We, of course, know that there are many things which  can  produce a
       similar reaction.  Gamma   globulin,  pancreatic  extracts,  nucleic
       acids and so  on.   But  none  of   these  is  as  effective  or  as
       physiologic as hydrochloric acid.

       To show the tremendous support for healing such a  therapy  can  be,
       consider this case.

       An individual who  had  ulcers  in  the  duodenum and pyloric for 22
       years.  X-ray confirmed an active  state  of one of the lesions.  He
       received 10 injections of hydrogen chloride and all  evidence of the
       peptic ulcer disappeared.

       It is probable  that several hormones influencing the motions of the
       intestine and its  accessory organs  are  liberated  when  the  acid
       gastric juice containing  digested  food comes in contact  with  the
       duodenal mucous membrane.  We know that iron salts precipitate in a

                                      Page 10





       neutral or slightly   alkaline  medium  and  thus  the  presence  of
       hydrochloric acid in the stomach  serves  a  useful purpose in those
       who are being given iron for the treatment of anemia.

       We know that  Vitamin  B-1  is  unstable  in  neutral   or  alkaline
       solutions and for  this  reason hydrochloric acid plays some part in
       the efficient utilization  of  this   substance  given  orally.   By
       preventing the decomposition of thiamine which would  otherwise take
       place in the achlorhydric stomach, hydrochloric acid allows the full
       amount taken into the stomach to reach the duodenum.

       All disease processes,  whether  functional,  metabolic,  endocrine,
       allergic, acute, chronic  or degenerative  are  accompanied  by  the
       condition of acidosis  and  the deficiency of the hydrochloric  acid
       production.  It goes  without saying that the longer that ill health
       is permitted to  exist in the body  the  less  capable  the  tissues
       become to respond  to  physiological  stimuli.   Use   of   hydrogen
       chloride therapy in  rheumatism  and  arthritis is rather rewarding.
       In the treatment of acute articular rheumatism it is imperative that
       treatment be started immediately.   If  treatment is given when only
       one joint is  effected the process can be stopped  right  there  and
       then.  In the  treatment of arthritis we give intravenous injections
       of dilute hydrochloric acid solution  daily  for  about three weeks.
       When the pain has subsided we proceed to eliminate or cure all focal
       infections such as abscessed teeth, infected tonsils and turbinates,
       an infected or lacerated cervix, prostate glands and  rectal crypts,
       etc.

       Carbon monoxide has  an  affinity for hemoglobin 300 times as strong
       as that of oxygen.  We have found  the use of an injection of dilute
       hydrochloric acid intravenously  will  accelerate   the  release  of
       carbon monoxide from the hemoglobin.

       It is well  known  that  a  certain  reserve  of  alkaline  salts is
       necessary to normal physiology and  that  among many functions which
       might be mentioned the oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange carried on
       through the presence of an optimal amount of alkalies  in the blood.
       Decrease this reserve and oxidation becomes materially reduced.

       Actually the amount  of  oxidation  going on in the cells or tissues
       does not depend on the quantity of  oxygen absorbed or on the amount
       available in the blood but rather on the capacity of  the tissues to
       use it.  The  nature  of  this  catalyst  or  enzyme  is not clearly
       determined but most physiologists  at  present  recognize  that some
       such agent as  a  catalyst  is necessary for normal  oxidation.   It
       appears likely that   the  presence  of  hydrogen  chloride  in  the
       maintenance of the acid base balance  is responsible for this normal
       oxidation.  Here is an interesting case history from  the  annals of
       medicine.

       A very sick  woman was seen on a house-call basis.  Upon examination
       her temperature was found to be 100  degrees,  respiration 56, pulse
       160, she was highly toxic, cyanotic with a glassy glare  in her eyes
       and she was  unconscious.   She  was  immediately  given 20 cc. of a
       dilute solution of hydrochloric  acid  intravenously  and  within  5
       minutes there was a marked improvement in the heart,  the  breathing
       and the general condition.  The cyanosis disappeared, she opened
       her eyes and  spoke.   The  attending physician returned three hours
       later.  The temperature had gone up 1.5 degrees.  She was still

                                      Page 11





       conscious and her  general  condition  was  good.  It was then found
       that she had a septic incomplete abortion  which was then surgically
       corrected and the patient went on to complete recovery.

       There was a  case reported before the American Association  for  the
       Advancement of Science  by a doctor.  He stated a case history; "The
       patient was moribund due to the unexpected effects of an anesthetic.
       The hydrochloric acid was injected  at 10:15 AM, eight minutes later
       the lips began  to  twitch and ten minutes the hands  moved  and  in
       forty minutes the patient was talking coherently."

       Early in the  month  of January, Dr. B. Ferguson was called to see a
       patient, a man of 55 apparently dying  from angina pectoris.  He was
       alone in the hotel room and could give no history of his ailment.  A
       partly empty bottle of Digitalis was on the dresser.  Breathing from
       water-filled lungs precluded any possibility of hearing  anything of
       the very rapid  and  tumultuous heart.  With the aid of a bellboy he
       was given an  intravenous injection  of  hydrochloric  acid  dilute.
       Before the completion  of the injection the breathing  had  improved
       and the patient rested easier.

       It has been  observed  that an injection of hydrochloric acid dilute
       intravenously does not markedly change  the  carbon dioxide capacity
       of the blood while the oxygen content is markedly  increased  in  30
       minutes.

       It is entirely  possible  that intravenous solutions of hydrochloric
       acid can result  in more oxidation  of  red  blood  cells  than  the
       inhalation of oxygen through a nasal breathing device.

       In a previous  passage I showed a sequence of events  when  hydrogen
       chloride supplies diminish.   The  bacterial  growth within the body
       accelerates, the toxic levels rise and the sequence continues.

       Usually the disappearance of hydrogen  chloride  is  gradual and the
       bacteria wander into the circulation casually without  provoking the
       defensive mechanism.

       There begins a  constant  and  unending flow of bacteria toxins into
       the bloodstream followed by slowing  up  of  the circulation and all
       other physiological processes.   As a result of this  the  bacterial
       toxins start to accumulate in the bloodstream and a mild toxemia set
       in.  It is generally known that the patient presents himself for the
       first time to  consult with his family doctor.  He complains of mild
       functional disorders such as general weakness, a loss of appetite, a
       lack of endurance, a sallow complexion and irritability.

       The avidity with  which the white  cells  absorb  or  destroy  every
       foreign substance entering the bloodstream soon manifests  itself in
       the fact that  the  white  cells become smothered and overpowered by
       the increasing accumulation of bacterial  toxins.   The great influx
       of bacterial poisons having rendered the white cells  impotent,  the
       phagocytic response almost  nil,  even  though  there  may be a high
       leukocyte count.  Examination   of   the   blood  picture  after  an
       injection of hydrogen  chloride  will  reveal  a great  increase  in
       leukocytic and phagocytic activity.

       When the hydrogen  chloride  supplies  in the bloodstream become too
       low the body begins to manufacture other kinds of acids to

                                      Page 12





       neutralize the alkalosis  that  supervenes.  This is accomplished by
       lactic, carbonic, butyric, diacetic, acetic and fatty acids.

       This is followed by a functional stimulation  of  the gastric glands
       responsible for the production of hydrogen chloride.  As a result of
       this disturbance an over-production of hydrogen chloride  begins  to
       take place.  An  over-production  of  the  acid  takes  place  and a
       condition of hyperchlorhydria and  toxemia  becomes  manifest.   Our
       patient now pays  his  respects  for  a second time  to  the  family
       physician and reiterates  his  former  complaints  but  with the new
       added ones of the sympotoms of gastric distress.

       A disordered chemistry follows the  vanishing  of  hydrogen chloride
       from the circulation  and  its  replacement  by the  acid  metabolic
       wastes.  Some of  these  wastes  cannot be converted into substances
       suitable for excretion.  This factor  plus the presence of bacterial
       toxins or any  other  form  of poisons entering the  blood  and  the
       progressive slowing up    of   the   circulation   and   all   other
       physiological processes of the varied  tissues  gives  rise  to  the
       inability of the body to throw off completely metabolic  acid  waste
       as quickly as   they   are  formed,  and  therefore  they  begin  to
       accumulate in the  bloodstream  bringing   about  the  condition  of
       incipient acidosis and toxemia.

       Our patient now  makes  a  third  visit complaining  of  a  lack  of
       endurance, irritability, nervousness,   insomnia,  vague  pains  and
       digestive problems.  Observe that as the functional disturbances are
       beginning to become aggravated new symptoms are beginning to appear.

       In the disposal of the acid wastes  the bloodstream serves merely as
       a conveyor.  The  absence of an adequate supply of potassium  salts,
       for example, gives  rise  to  a  diminution of the hydrogen chloride
       production.  Be that as it may, the  production of hydrogen chloride
       falls short and  the condition known as hypochlorhydria  supervenes.
       The progressiveness of  this  metabolic  disorder  is  apparent  for
       sooner or later there is a total  suppression  of  the production of
       hydrogen chloride and  the  condition  know as achlorhydria  becomes
       manifest.

       Clinically this train of events manifests itself as malnutrition and
       a so-called physiological   disturbance,  metabolic,  endocrine  and
       organic.  Any of  the  infectious   arthritis   and  osteoarthritis,
       endocarditis, ulcerative endocarditis,    myocarditis,     rheumatic
       pericarditis, acute chorea,    muscular    rheumatism,    peripheral
       neuritis, herpes, abscess   of  the   brain,   acute   appendicitis,
       cholecystitis, salpingitis, oophoritis,   thyroiditis,    nephritis,
       osteomyelitis, phlebitus, synovitis,    various    skin   disorders,
       arteriosclerosis, bacteremia and the list goes on and on.

       Faulty digestion and  assimilation   due  to  a  deficiency  of  the
       hydrogen chloride production in the stomach brings about a resulting
       serious depletion of  the  alkaline reserve, malnutrition,  impaired
       metabolism, and a  derangement  of  the physiologic functions of the
       varied tissues.

       Furthermore, the bloodstream  becomes   stagnant   with   the   ever
       increasing accumulation of bacterial toxins, metabolic  acid wastes,
       acid wastes, acid  salts  altered  secretions of the endocrine gland
       and bacteria.  The bloodstream becomes a literal cesspool against

                                      Page 13





       which the varied  tissues,  particularly  those  with  an inheritied
       weakness or susceptibility,  begin   to   react.   Clinically  there
       becomes manifest the condition of advanced acidosis and toxemia.

       Our patient is  still  with  us  and by now he complains  of  marked
       general weakness, nervousness,    insomnia,   digestive   disorders,
       various functional disturbances of a metabolic and endocrine nature,
       functional disturbances of  the  heart,  severe  headache,  allergic
       manifestations, malnutrition, vague pains all over  the  body and in
       addition the symptoms   of   any  inflammatory  or  organic  lesions
       present.  He again visits his family physician.

       He is now  advised  to consult the  elite  of  the  profession,  the
       surgeon, neurologist, endocrinologist,   allergist,    the   stomach
       specialist and others.   In  due  time having made the rounds of the
       various specialists he finds himself  relieved of various appendages
       and certain sums  of  money.   His  condition,  however,   continues
       progressively worse.  The    deficiency    of    hydrogen   chloride
       production, starvation of minerals,  vitamins  and  amino  acids and
       other food elements  and  a  total unbalance or derangement  of  all
       physiological functions of  the  varied  tissues  of the body.  Also
       there is ever   decreasing   degree    of   tissue   susceptibility.
       Furthermore it is  to be observed that at this stage  it  no  longer
       matters what the predisposing factor has been that brought about the
       ill health.

       Well, time marches    on.     The    ever   increasing   degree   of
       intensification of each and every  component  comprising the general
       causation coupled with  the  presence  of  one or more  pathological
       processes brings back  our patient not only with the symptoms of the
       demonstrable pathology but also the symptoms of advanced progressive
       acidosis and toxemia, exhaustion  and  easy  fatigability, insomnia,
       feeling of pressure in the front of the head, the  top  of  the head
       and the back  of  the neck, the region of the throat and sternum are
       also favorite locations in which tight feelings occur.  There may be
       backache, bellyache, severe headace,  dizzy  spells,  muscular pains
       and weakness, dyspepsia,   extreme  nervousness  and   irritability,
       sexual disorders, mental  disturbances,  numbness  of hands, fingers
       and toes, clammy hands and feet,  vague  pains  all  over  the body,
       subnormal or above  normal temperature, high or low  blood  pressure
       and various functional  heart  disorders.   By this time one or more
       allergic diseases have already become manifest.

       By now our patient finally realizes  the futility of seeking further
       aid be it   allopathic,   homeopathic,  osteopathic,   chiropractic,
       neuropathic, or what  have  you and settles down in the bitter frame
       of mind to await his day of deliverance.

       On and on the process continues until  all the varied tissues become
       saturated with these   poisons   with  complete   loss   of   tissue
       susceptibility and the aberration of all physiological functions.
       Degenerative disease is  but  a  reaction of the tissues against the
       general pathology.  It  can  take   any  number  of  forms  such  as
       areteriosclerosis, diabetes, nephritis,  affections  of  the  heart,
       neoplastic growths, pernicious   anemia,   leukemia,   lymphadenoma,
       senile insanity, multiple sclerosis, and arthritic degenerations.

       Now let's take a look at this patient  in  the final stages.  Let us
       visualize the patient in his final stage of advanced acidosis and

                                      Page 14





       toxemia.  Look about  you as your friends, your loved ones.  Look at
       yourself.  Ask yourself, "How do  you  feel,  really?"   All of this
       tragedy, the death,  the  pain,  and  despair  solvable   by  simple
       therapies generated by  a simple process of thought and administered
       in a simple gesture of help and kindness.

       All of this available for more than  thirty  years.   But  what  has
       become of the genius that sprouted forth from the  minds  of  a  few
       physicians long ago?   A  simple  call  to  the  Bureau  of  Medical
       Investigation will reveal them to be "dead quacks!"

       At this moment we need an Emergency Survival Philosophy.

       In the future we will all participate in the Health Crimes Trials of
       the Twentieth Century.
