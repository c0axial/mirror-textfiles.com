           Many youngsters   participated   in  a  NASA  space  project  by
       capturing fireflies for the space  agency.  NASA  researchers wanted
       the luciferase found  in  fireflies to develop a machine  to  detect
       possible microorganisms on other planets.

          Luciferase produces   light   in   the   presence   of  adenosine
       triphosphate (ATP), which  is  a biochemical  found  in  all  living
       things. The NASA  biochemical  machine  process  for   detection  of
       extraterrestrial life has been adapted to human health uses in FLASH
       (Fast Luciferase Automated  Assay  Specimens  for  Hospitals), which
       analyzes bacteria in urine samples.

          In the assay, urine glows (becomes  bioluminescent)  if  bacteria
       are in it, and quantitative information is obtained automatically by
       detecting and recording light given off by the urine sample.

          Luciferase is  now  artificially  synthesized and  available  for
       widespread use.
