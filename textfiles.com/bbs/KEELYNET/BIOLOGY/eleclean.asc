                          Electronic Cleansing of Tissue
                                by Jerry W. Decker
                                  Sysop/KeelyNet

       This is a  "hypothetical"  file based on observations, various books
       and papers, discussions,  my own admittedly  limited  understanding,
       the file AGE7 and the file PAPIMI, (both on KeelyNet).

       The entire idea  is based on a very simple principle.   We  eat,  we
       drink, our bodies  are  SUPPOSED  to  process  all the food, that is
       remove the energy and some of the  mass;  which  is  converted  into
       tissue, and excrete the depleted mass as waste.

       A truly efficent and optimized organism would not  leave  ANY  waste
       material in the  body  and would extract the MAXIMUM ENERGY from the
       food or drink.   What  the  body   fails   to  remove,  remains  and
       PUTREFIES, becoming toxic  to the body.  These toxins  irritate  the
       tissue which manifests as disease.  The disease then alters the flow
       of energy in the body, loading the circuit as it were and helping to
       detract from the creation of new, optimized tissue.

       As specified in  AGE7,  these  toxic buildups could be thought of as
       the clogging of a filter where the  body IS the filter.  So, how can
       we "backflush" this filter to remove the accumulations?

       Nikola Tesla spoke of an "electric bath" to invigorate  and help the
       body to heal.  This does not mean to imply a literal bathtub type of
       bath, with immersion  in  an  electrified  fluid  such as water, but
       rather to be bathed in electricity  from  the  secondary  of a Tesla
       coil.

       We do have some information regarding "galvanic baths"  where  metal
       plates are suspended  in  a  bathtub  filled with water.  The person
       sits in the tub and the current flows  through their body as part of
       the circuit.  This  is  circa  1900 to 1940 information,  so  PLEASE
       DON'T TRY THIS TODAY.

       I must admit  succumbing to a "test" of this principle to see how it
       worked.  It took advantage of a battery  powered  (9 volt) TENS unit
       with adjustable frequency  and intensity.  I wondered  if  it  would
       work in a  shower  if  the shower was "dense" enough (like me), so I
       hooked up one electrode to the showerhead  and  the other to a piece
       of aluminum foil in the shower base.  This was then connected to the
       TENS unit at about half power.

                                      Page 1





       Nothing happened.  I  did  feel  a  slight  tremor when touching the
       showerhead direct, but nothing to write home about.  So, I increased
       the power to full (new battery) and again touched the showerhead.

       My muscles locked in place and I  could  not  let  go!   It was VERY
       STIMULATING but I  had  no  control of my arm muscles,  stricture  I
       think they call  it.   But I finally broke loose.  The after effects
       were simply EXCELLENT.  I felt very  exhilarated and full of energy.
       That feeling lasted for several hours.

       The second attempt  was with a bathtub full of water  after  reading
       several papers on  the  "galvanic  bath".  I used the same TENS unit
       but at MUCH LESS power and with  about  2  tablespoons  of  salt  to
       enhance the conduction.  The effect was similar but  not  nearly  as
       invigorating.  I attribute  that  to  surface  area because the arms
       were not the primary method of current  transfer  as  before, rather
       the energy was through the water with the body being  simply  a part
       of a larger  conductive  body.  The power was increased and although
       it was detectable, I did not "lockup"  as  with  the  earlier shower
       experience.

       The third attempt  was  when  Ron, Chuck and I did  our  Zap  Dallas
       lightning show.  We  all  tried  standing on an elevated metal plate
       that was connected  to  the  secondary  of  a  Tesla  coil  with  an
       adjustable power output.  The idea was to shoot the  bolts  off  the
       hands.  The top  sustained power (for prolonged periods) was 900,000
       volts normally; with  one test at  1,000,000  volts  (only  about  5
       seconds, that hurt!).  The frequency was 170KHZ.

       The emission of  the  high potential charges from the  body  created
       quantities of ozone   that  were  very  stimulating.   Additionally,
       despite the "skin effect" contentions,  there seemed to be some kind
       of invigorating influence beyond that of the ozone.   This  was most
       probably the ozone  but  I think there was also something to do with
       the electricity or frequency.  The point is, it was very stimulating
       and that feeling remained for about 2 hours afterward.

       So, is it  possible  to use "ionic  conduction"  to  remove  foreign
       toxins from the  body  tissues?  If you stood on a  plate  that  was
       "excited" by a  Tesla  coil  and let the energy flow from your skin,
       would it "takeup" anything loose  enough  to  be considered foreign?
       Would this include  dead tissue?  The tissue could  be  "milked"  by
       successive polarizations at  the  induced  frequency.   This milking
       effect would dislodge  and displace  to  the  surface  of  the  skin
       (because of the  energy flow from inward to outward)  any  loose  or
       foreign components and that might include toxins or dead tissue.

       The overall electric  output as it exits from the skin should NOT be
       high enough to create sparks, SIMPLY  A CORONA, so the amplitude and
       frequency should be adjustable to achieve that effect.  Although air
       is the normal  "ground"  for  this  process,  the  effect  might  be
       accelerated by using  a metal collector that would act as ground for
       the corona field.

       The collector would function as the  cathode for the accumulation of
       any material that  was exuded from the body. It should  also  reduce
       the energy required  to achieve the effect because of a controllable
       dielectric, based on spacing of the  metal  cathode  from  the skin,
       rather than just stochastic discharges into the air dielectric.

       Since waves travel   longitudinally,   that   is,  up  and  down  as
       compression and rarefaction, the depth  of penetration of the signal
       will be dependent  on  two  factors,  i.e.,  the amplitude  and  the
       wavelength of the signal.

       Pain would only  be  generated  when the current was too intense and
       this is regardless  of  frequency.    The   pain  results  from  the
       alternate polarization of the tissue, a jerking back and forth under
       control of the charge polarities.  So the greater the  current,  the
       more intense the  jerking  and  the  greater  the pain.  In fact, it
       could result in rupturing of tissue  because of the amplitude of the
       jerking action/reaction.

       Now if we  think  of  the  wave as having a crest (positive)  and  a
       trough (negative), that are equal in amplitude, the zero crossing
       or "ground" reference  would  be  the skin.  So, the amplitude would
       determine the depth to which the signal would penetrate the skin.

       There are two types of energy involved  here,  one  is  current, the
       other is voltage.  Both are present in a normal Tesla  coil  output,
       however, the Tesla coil puts out a much higher voltage than current.
       Typical current values  are  in  the  microamp  range, with voltages
       ranging from 20,000 volts up to 2 million, though they can go higher
       or lower.

       So, we have an "envelope" that makes  up  the wave crest and trough.
       That envelope consists of both voltage and current,  so  the  higher
       the voltage the  larger  the  heighth of the wave, the more current,
       the denser the field within that  wave.   We  therefore  try for the
       least possible current with the best workable voltage.   The  reason
       is to affect the majority of tissue, that is, to penetrate as deeply
       as possible for  complete  saturation  and  the  maximum  successive
       "milking" effect.

       In Tesla's work,  he used high frequency,  high  potential  currents
       which created a  "flame"  type  of corona as seen  in  some  of  the
       photographs where the  electrical  currents  were streaming from the
       skin.  This was not in the least  painful  because  the  frequencies
       were high, the potential was high and the current  was  probably  in
       the picoampere range.

       I have been thinking on this for several years now as an alternative
       health technique that   might   prove   beneficial.   Based  on  our
       experiences with Zap Dallas, there  are  safety considerations which
       can be implemented to minimize the risk.

       The basic idea involves using a tuneable Tesla coil  to  provide the
       high frequency driving  signal.   It  is  similar  to  the Lakhovsky
       Multi-Wave Oscillator which   uses   a   multi-frequency   broadband
       electrostatic antenna that is beamed toward the subject.

       The idea is that all tissue vibrates at many different  frequencies.
       When the tissue  is  in  the  presence of a frequency that resonates
       with it, the tissue will be energetically  "pulled  up" to match the
       amplitude of the   driving   signal,  just  like   a   tuning   fork
       sympathetically resonates with  other  forks  or  bodies of the same
       frequency AND TRANSFERS ENERGY IN THE PROCESS.

       Lakhovsky had astounding results with healing various diseases

                                      Page 3





       including cancer, tumors  and  a  host  of other viral and bacterial
       infections.

       Though a Tesla coil is MOST EFFICIENT  at its resonant frequency, it
       will still pass any frequency that is put into it, it is simply that
       the closer the  frequency is to the actual resonant  frequency,  the
       greater is the output.

       The way the  Lakhovksy  MWO  works  is  to use a series of separated
       concentric rings, i.e. one within  another  and  with  a gap in each
       ring.  The distance  from  one  ring  to  the other  determines  the
       discharge time and  therefore  the  electrostatic  frequency that is
       emitted.  That is how one basic frequency  from  the  Tesla coil can
       produce MANY frequencies...the secret is in the antenna.

       As to producing multiple waves from a Tesla coil as does the MWO, it
       is impossible because  of the wide range of the MWO  signals.   They
       span from about  3cps  up  to  about  3gigacps  (billion).  However,
       experimentation with the RIFE frequencies  as well as various others
       in the thousand or million cps ranges will yield the  best  results,
       and we have not even mentioned modulated or nested signals.

       The layout of the equipment would be

           1)  the  Tesla  coil (with optional tapped primary and secondary
               to tune the coil to resonate with the applied frequency)
           2)  fed by a variable oscillator,
           3)  a non-conductive stand about  1  foot high to prevent arcing
               to the floor,
           4)  a metal plate or pan of water which the subject stands in or
               on to achieve maximum conduction of the signal.

       The Tesla coil  would  ideally  be battery driven for  safety.   The
       subject would stand  on the plate, while the assistant would operate
       the power and  frequency controls,  all  the  while  monitoring  the
       subject for any adverse reactions.  Everything should  be documented
       for future reference.   (An  interesting  file  that  describes this
       principle for viewing the aura is AURAVIEW.ZIP on KeelyNet.)

       Not only would this machine provide  an  invigorating  effect to the
       subject but it would also have health implications  that  at present
       are only speculative.

       I have yet to do this experiment but plan to do so in the future and
       will report on  any results, good or bad.  If anyone else chooses to
       try it, I would greatly appreciate your feedback.
