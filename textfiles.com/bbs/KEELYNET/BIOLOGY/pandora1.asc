       The following is  a  description  of a prank device as listed on the
       various boards devoted to phreaking or hacking.

       High frequency sound, just above the  audio range, has been shown to
       be an irritant.  We at Vangard Sciences and KeelyNet offer this file
       only for your  amusement  and  hereby  disclaim  all  responsibility

       BROUGHT TO YOU FROM THE EXPANSIVE, WELL EQUIPED, AND VERY EXPENSIVLY
       DECORATED LABORATORIES OF DR. RAT I.C.R.

       THIS BOX FALLS  INTO  THE PRANK CATAGORY.  IT HAS LITTLE PHREAK/HACK
       USE, EXCEPT FOR IRRITATING THE HELL  OUT  OF ANYONE ON THE PHONE. IT
       MAKES OPERATORS MORE PISSED THAN TURNING ON YOUR CARRIER FOR THEM.

       A PHASOR IS A DEVICE USING HIGH INTENSITY SOUND TO PRODUCE PAIN. I'M
       SURE YOU HAVE  SEEN PHASORS (CROWD/DOG CONTROL, PAIN  FIELDS,  ETC.)
       FOR SALE IN  INFORMATION  UNLIMITED  ADS  OR CATALOGS. UNFORTUNENTLY
       THESE OFTEN COST $100 TO $1000. NATCHLY  THIS  WOULDN'T  DO  FOR DR.
       RAT. SO I CREATED THE POOR MAN'S PHASOR OR ...PANDORA'S BOX.

       PRODUCING THE SOUND  WAS  EASY  AND  THE  CIRCUIT  IS  PROBABLY  THE
       SIMPLEST METHOD TO PRODUCE A VARIABLE SOUND FROM A 555 CHIP. THE
       ONLY DRAWBACK TO  P.B. IS THAT YOU NEED TO USE A $13 TWEETER BECAUSE
       IT USES SO  LITTLE  POWER  AND GIVES  THE  LOUDEST  OUTPUT  OF  HIGH
       FREQUENCY SOUND.  PARTS LIST WITH RADIO SHACK CAT NUMBERS

           1. ONE 555 TIMER (RS#. 276-1723)
           2. ONE .01 MFD CAPACITOR (RS#. 272-131)
           3. ONE 100K VARIABLE RESISTOR (RS#. 271-1722)
           4. ONE TWEETER (RS#. 40-1381)
           5. ONE 9V BATTERY
           6. SOME WIRE (ANY KIND. DR. RAT SUGGESTS RS#. 278-1294)

       NOTE: YOU CAN  CHANGE THE VALUES OF #2 OR #3 ON THE  LIST  SLIGHTLY.
       BUT THESE ARE EXTREMELY EASY TO FIND SO TRY TO USE THEM.

       NOTE: PIN 1 OF THE 555 IS THE PIN  NEXT TO A SMALL DOT ON TOP OF THE
             CHIP.  VARIABLE   RESISTORS  HAVE  THREE  LEADS--THE   CIRCUIT
             REQUIRES ONLY  TWO, SO CONNECT ONE WIRE TO THE MIDDLE LEAD AND
             THE OTHER WIRE TO EITHER OF THE OUTER LEADS.

       HERE'S A PIN BY PIN READING OF THE  WIRING  IN  CASE THE CIRCUIT GOT
       SCREWED DURING TRANSMISSION.

                                      Page 2





       1. PIN 1  CONNECTED TO THE -9V, ONE LEAD OF THE TWEETER, AND ONE END
          OF THE CAPACITOR.
       2. PIN 2 CONNECTED TO PIN 6 AND THE OTHER END OF THE CAPACITOR
       3. PIN 3 CONNECTED TO OTHER LEAD OF  TWEETER  AND TO ONE LEAD OF THE
          VARIABLE RESISTOR
       4. PIN 4 CONNECTED TO PIN 8
       5. PIN 5 NOT CONNECTED
       6. PIN 6 CONNECTED TO PIN 2 AND OTHER LEAD OF VARIABLE RESISTOR
       7. PIN 7 NOT CONNECTED
       8. PIN 8 CONNECTED TO +9V AND TO PIN 4

       P.B. WORKS ESPECIALY  WELL  ON  ANIMALS,  GIRLS,  AND  YOUNG  PEOPLE
       BECAUSE THE BONES  IN  THEIR  EARS  ARE  SMALLER.   USE THE VARIABLE
       RESISTOR TO ADJUST THE PITCH TO JUST ABOVE THE HIGHEST PITCH YOU CAN
       HEAR. YOU MIGHT NOT NOTICE ANYTHING  AT  FIRST.   AFTER A SHORT TIME
       YOU SHOULD FEEL A TINGLE OR BUZZING IN YOU NECK, EARS,  OR SINUS.  A
       LITTLE WHILE LONGER  YOU  SHOULD FEEL A HEAD/NECK ACHE THAT GROWS IN
       PAIN. TRY TURNING IT TO AN AUDIBLE FREQUENCY AND BLASTING IT THROUGH
       THE PHONE. REMEMBER GIRLS CAN HEAR  HIGHER  PITCHES THAN MOST PEOPLE
       SO THEY CAN TELL WHEN YOU HAVE IT ON. TRY TURNING THE PITCH A LITTLE
       HIGHER SO THEY CAN'T HEAR IT. ENTERTAIN YOUR CLASS DURING FINALS.

                                     HAVE FUN!
