                                  Everyday Trance

                       From the May 26 BRAIN/MIND BULLETIN:

       According to Ernest  Rossi,  a  Los Angeles psychologist, most of us
       are unaware that periodically throughout  the  day, we enter natural
       trances. The apparent continuity that exists in everyday  awareness,
       Rossi explains, is  a  "precarious  illusion" based on conversation,
       task orientation and the like.

       But still, the mind wanders, and memories  flow  easily. Some people
       catch fleeting glimpses of "the big picture," while others become so
       entranced that they   neither   see  nor  hear.  Others   may   feel
       uncomfortable and try  to suppress what Rossi calls "personal truths
       that come unbidden during these naturally unguarded periods."

       The Basic Rest and Activity Cycle,  which  is  at  the root of these
       trance states, is an ultradian rhythm -- a shift that occurs about
       every 90 minutes.   Researchers   have   reported  a   left-to-right
       hemisphere shift as breathing changes from the right nasal passage
       to the left. The crossover period lasts roughly 10 minutes.

       Among the visual  cues  that  accompany  the  shifts are relaxation,
       reduced blinking, pupil dilation, reddening of the eyes, respiratory
       slowdown, and sweating.

       Rossi reports on  everyday  trances  in  a  new  volume  on  current
       research and theory entitled HANDBOOK OF STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS,
       edited by Benjamin Wolman and Montague Ullman (Van Nostrand).
