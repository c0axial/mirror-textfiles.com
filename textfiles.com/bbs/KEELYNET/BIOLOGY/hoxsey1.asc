                          What's in the Hoxsey Treatment?

                            By E. Edgar Bond, B.L.M.D.

                Editor of the Journal of Medical Physical Research
           -------------------------------------------------------------
                        This article is a reprint from the
                January, 1961, National Health Federation Bulletin.
           -------------------------------------------------------------

       In the Journal of The American Medical  Association  in its issue of
       June 12, 1954, is the account of its "investigation"  of  the Hoxsey
       Cancer Clinic of Dallas, Texas.

       This "investigation" was  conducted  from  its  swivel chairs in the
       Editorial office of Dearborn Street  in  Chicago,  Ill. It smacks of
       those ancient editorials  from the pen of Morris Fishbein,  who  was
       booted out for  writing  and  speaking  on  things  controversial in
       medicine because his  methods had  become  so  obnoxious  they  were
       disturbing even to  the  politician  in medical practitioners  ranks
       surrounding the A.M.A. and Trustees.

       The conclusion from that office was the Hoxsey Medicine was merely a
       "cough medicine" and  the only ingredients worth considering was one
       drug, Potassium Iodine. The conclusion it was a cough medicine was

                                      Page 1





       due, it said,  to  that drug being included in some cough medicines,
       as an expectorant.

       From all this "swivel chair investigation:  the report in part is as
       follows.

               "Any person  possessing  any  modicum  of knowledge  of  the
                pharmacological action   of  drugs  should  know  that  any
                combination of ingredients  listed  on the current label of
                the Hoxsey Tonic or in the statement filed over Mr.Hoxsey's
                signature in Federal Court in Dallas, Texas, is without any
                therapeutic merit in the treatment of cancer.

                Any such person who would seriously contend that scientific
                medicine is  under  any  obligation to investigate  such  a
                mixture or its promoter is either stupid or dishonest."

        We are preparing in this article to qualify as being either "stupid
       or dishonest." Yet  the AMA, which was Fishbein, from grandfather to
       Harry Hoxsey, have  tried to put  these  men  out  of  business  but
       without success and that is due to its success in treating cancer.

       Out of an experience of over fifty years we are preparing to analyze
       each ingredient which  both  experience  and  that of  many  eminent
       forefathers in the  field  of  medical  practice  purveying  natural
       medicines at the bedside has firmly established.

       Sometimes "scientific medicine"   is   not   scientific  nor  is  it
       conclusive. We are  not surprised Mr. Fishbein or  any  under  study
       applies to Potassium  Iodine the property of an expectorant in cough
       medicines. It is as alterative.

       If given in continuous doses it is  so potent as such it will create
       a rash or other skin lesions, evidence it does reach  every  cell of
       the body as  an  eliminate  rather  than  merely an expectorant in a
       coryza.

       In the article of June 12 the Journal  pays  great  attention to the
       trial of Dr. Hoxsey in which he was given restricted  orders  on the
       proper labeling of  the  Clinics  literature  but  from the evidence
       presented it did not prohibit him from using his remedies or sending
       the remedy by mail.

       There was one part of that trial the  Journal did not mention for it
       was proven " Dr." Fishbein had never visited a beside  as  a medical
       practitioner.

       Just how he  obtained  the  ever  present  M.D.  to his name was not
       entirely revealed. Yet this was the  man  of  medicine who closed up
       every Medical School  in  America except those he could  control  by
       medical politics. And  now  for  years he has been telling the world
       how it should heal all diseases.

       In addition "scientific medicine" in theory and practice is bound to
       the theory it takes a poison to "kill"  disease  and thus cannot see
       any virtue in natural medicines of botanical origin  which build and
       strengthen nature's fighting  forces  and enable it to better resist
       diseases as well as cure diseases. Such do not kill the patient with
       an overdose but hold vitality.

       In the last  analysis  all  medicines  are  proved, by actual use on
       patients. In jargon "Empirically."  The  following  is  the  16  oz.

       We submit the  following  analysis  of  each  in  its  clinical  and
       laboratory findings each   discovered   by   the  bedside  use,  and
       confirmed by recoveries from diseased  conditions as evidence of its
       value in such diseases as cancer, both internal and external.

                                 Potassium Iodide

       Potassium Iodide is  an  alterant  tonic influencing  the  glandular
       system, the serous   and   mucous   membranes.   It  cures  specific
       ulcerations.
                                      Page 3





       (Pot Ash) is  made from wood ashes as lye and is a strong alkali and
       brings with its  chemical  combination   with   Iodine   these  same
       qualities.

       With Iodine as a base there are formed many such combinations,  many
       of which are included in various medications.

                          Trifolium Pratense - Red Clover

       The common red clover is gathered when in perfect bloom and so used.

       It is a stimulating, alterant, influencing the capillary circulation
       to better distribution.  Its  use  promotes  healthy qranulations in
       indolent ulcers, scaly and pimply skin.

       In the elderly  person  it  influences   the  skin  to  more  normal
       condition and induces better protective moisture and perspiration.

                          Brudock Root - Arctium Lappa or
                           Lappa Major - Roots or Seeds

       The root is  a  soothing alterant, the seed are the  same  but  more
       active and somewhat  oily.  Eclectic physicians rely on this drug in
       blood dyscrasias and usually combine  it  with  more  stimulating or
       diffusive drugs if used in syphilitic cases.

       It is a persistent tonic alterative, relieves lymphatic congestions,
       inflammations of the skin and influences the alvine  structures.  It
       is of value  in  rheumatic conditions especially in the inflammatory
       stages of such  diseases aiding  in  cleansing  the  system  of  its
       accumulations.  Here the seed with its natural oils is of value.

                          Oascara Amarga - Honduras Bark
                                  Picramaia, Etc.

       This bark is little known by modern physicians yet  it is one of the
       best stimulating alteratives we have in the botanical field.

       It is of especial value in gummy tumors, chronic catarrhs, localized
       tubercules and general  blood disturbances. In fact, this drug seems
       to stimulate the kidneys and skin  in  such a manner as to eliminate
       the accumulated virus through these emunctories as  it  improves the
       appetite and digestion.

       It has been  also  known  the  addition  of  Berberis, Potassium and
       Xanthoxylum adds some  properties   due   to   their  diffusion  and
       emulating properties.

                        Xanthoxylum Flaxineum - Prickly Ash

       This drug made from the bark seed or berries is a positive diffusive
       stimulant which produces better arterial and capillary circulations.

       This property is unlike that of capsicum, in that it is more lasting
       and more agreeable the taste.

       It arouses the skin, is different have reaching to cold extremities,
       stimulates caralivary salivary and lymphatic gland and mucous areas.

       Of value by  itself  yet  it  is often combined with Phytolacca Root
       when it becomes  even  more  effective  in  rheumatisms,  scrofulaes
       congestions and paralysis.  A  vehicle  made  from   ripe   berries,
       possesses similar values but much milder in clinical values.

                        Phytolacca Decandra - Poke Berries

       This plant is common to our woods and fields, easily recognized with
       its stems of long black berries which are largely eaten by robins to
       condition them for their long flight south.

       Both berries and  the green root are used. Phytolacca influences all
       the deep structures and relieves congested or inflamed areas.

       It is a stimulating, relaxing alterant  which influences all serous,
       mucous and glandular structures. It enables the physician to relieve
       the system of excess accumulations of fats and filth within and give
       to the patient more muscular solidity.

       It is a  persistent remedy so is used in orchitis,  mammary  ovarian
       and scrofulous abscesses.   It  will  avert  body  and cartilaginous
       swellings and is of great value in rheumatisms.

                               Stillingia Sylvatica

       The root of this plant is used which also is a positive, stimulating
       drugs is urged for in large doses  it  is  cathartic and even emetic
       and may leave within the bowels a burning sensation.

       Like many of the foregoing drugs it is an alterant  to the glandular
       system and is   used   in   secondary   syphilis,  eczemas,  ulcers,
       scrofulaes and malignant eruptions.

                           Rhamnus Frangula - Buckthorn

       This is the European variety which is a mild, stimulative, laxative,
       cholagogue which in large doses  becomes  a  cathartic  of  moderate
       impression.

       Its addition to  any alterative medications gives persistent  values
       toward easy elimination  of  toxic  impurities in any system without
       any of the usual cathartic disturbing carps.  In such action it is a
       tonic laxative rather than that of drastic disturbances.

                           Glycyrrhiza Glabra - Licorice

       This root is  usually used as a vehicle  to  cover  up  any  bitter,
       tonic, medications, but the profession have of late discovered it is
       more than a mere covering for bitter taste.

       It is a  demulcent and gentle laxative yet somewhat  stimulating  to
       membranes. This is  now  emphasized  as  a  valuable addition to any
       combination of drugs designed to use in inflammatory ulcerations and
       many other indications in digestive disturbances.

       Is it a "Shot Gun" Prescription?

       Perhaps one may be secured in such a combination as using a shotgun"
       prescription. But when one analyses it he finds each has its

                                      Page 5





       purpose and reaches  diseases  especially  in cancers which are many
       sided from many angles as an eliminating  alterative,  blood builder
       and mildly stimulating factor in urging the system  to eliminate its
       accumulations of its pathology and rebuild.

                              Modern Theory of Cancer

       The difficulty of  those administering remedies in cancers, and such
       allied conditions, is in not realizing  cancer is first and always a
       systematic diseases and  failure to understand the manifestation  we
       term a local  cancer  is  not  the  entire  cause  of  the  systemic
       disturbances which are present as a result of such visable lesion.

       We are attempting to cure cancers  by  more  and  more X-ray forces,
       Radium and surgical elimination of the local manifestation  when  we
       should begin at  the  root  causes  and  its elimination by means of
       systemic eliminates. We must attack cancer as a systemic disease.

                           This Formulae Does Just That

       And, in the opinion of ten capable  medical  investigators,  does it
       better than any  other method available if used conscientiously  and
       persistently.

       We do not  expect  to  create  a great revolution soon in modern day
       methods of theory and practice concerning  the  cancer problems, but
       we have the  privilege  of an American citizen to expose  the  wrong
       thinking in the  medical  world  concerning the effectiveness of the
       above remedies, which are almost wholly botanical.

       Each drug is one which gives positive  elimination results which are
       term alterative in action.

       It is seldom realized that these near nature drugs  are possessed of
       antibiotic, that is,  have  bactericidal properties, especially when
       in the raw state, neither does the  average  physician realize these
       possess antiscorbic properties  as  also  diuretic   and   cathartic
       properties.

       Should there be  no  other  argument  for their efficiency, these of
       their elimination properties should  ensize  any  one with reason to
       reach the conclusion  there  is  in  this  formulae   these   needed
       properties in treating cancer.

       Also, there is  in  it  tonic  properties  which build in the system
       greater assimilation and strength from foods consumed.

       That this formulae does all of these  in  almost a miraculous way is
       attested to by ten medical men who had places at their disposal many
       witnesses and hundreds of authentic records.

       Editor's Note: This  article is being re-run in this  issue  of  the
                      Bulletin, in  the  hope,  that  Doctors  who have the
                      interest of their  patients  at  heart  will  use the
                      remedy in connection with whatever  method  they  now
                      use in  the  care  of patients who are afflicted with
                      this dread disease.   This  with the use of a Doctors
                      regular procedure, provided he is not  already  using
                      any of the ingredients contained in the mixture.

                                      Page 6





       Those who have  used  both  the  liquid and the pills have advise us
       they feel they  have received better  results  when  they  used  the
       liquid.

       This may be  due  to  the fact that some people do  not  digest  the
       coating on th  pills, hence they pass through the system and have no
       affect.

       This liquid can  be mixed by any  good  herb  man  or  druggist  and
       therefore can be  available  to  a  Doctor, who is licensed  to  use
       drugs, no matter where his practice may be located.

       In administering this  remedy,  the  same care should be used, as is
       used in the administering of any other drug.  In addition to regular
       care a strict diet should be followed.

       All foods that produce uric acid  should  be  avoided,  as  much  as
       possible. Those who follow a diet, during treatment, similar to that
       followed by vegetarians appear to recover faster  and  better.   The
       diet used with  the  Koch  treatment is also very good, according to
       the experience of patients reporting to us.

       The foregoing remedy is an alterative  and  topic. It should be used
       as an adjutant  to a doctor's regular procedure. It  should  not  be
       called a cancer cure, but rather an aid to normalcy.

                         Reactions to Foregoing Tablets or
                                 Liquid Medication

       If any of  the  following  symptoms  develop  and  are  too  severe,
       discontinue medication until symptoms  are  gone  (usually in two or
       three days). Then resume with one-half original dosage and gradually
       increase dosage to  an  amount  most comfortably tolerate  and  then
       continue.
                                     Reactions

       Pimples appear on  face,  shoulders  and  forehead, as well as other
       locations on the body. They may become  boil  like.   Glands  in the
       neck may swell, as well as the area of trouble.

       Excessive watering of the eyes and nose may occur particularly  when
       bending over.  Nausea  and  vomiting  may develop. A bitter or salty
       taste may upset the appetite and  an  extreme  feeling  of weakness,
       particularly in the knees, may occur, as well as a  pounding,  rapid
       heartbeat.

       These symptoms seldom  occur  but  are  given here as a guide to the
       doctor in caring for his patient. The pills should be crushed before
       swallowing.
