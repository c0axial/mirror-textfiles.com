         The following was in a program called SEXCNST.EXE and it printed
         out forms.  It did not work well with my laser printer, so it is
                      just listed on KeelyNet as a text file.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       SEXCNST prints Sexual consent forms,  which may also be known as Kim
       Campbells, or KC's.  Given the recent changes in the law, it may be
       advisable for any male to have his sex partner complete such a form
       before engaging in any sexual activity in Canada.

       The program prints six wallet sized forms per 11" page, and prompts
       for the number required.  If you are an active male print a supply
       and don't leave home without them.

       For reasonable results it is suggested that the form not be
       presented to your partner until after a good dinner, with candle
       light and romantic background music, and with not more than one
       glass of wine.  More than one glass of wine may enhance the mood,
       but unfortunately may also invalidate the signed form.

       For best results hold off presenting the form until fore play has
       made your partner fully receptive.  The danger in this is possible
       complications in any future legal action, so it may be best to stay
       with the reasonable approach.

       If she refuses to sign the form run, don't walk, to the nearest
       exit.  Freedom does sometimes come at a terrible price, and this is
       one of those times.

       There is space for a witness to sign the form.  This is witness of
       signature only and the witness is not required beyond signature
       point, though if you and your partner are not too shy it may be a
       good idea, for your legal protection, to keep one or more witnesses
       present for the whole event.  Do not, however, get carried away and
       sell tickets to witnesses as that too may cause legal complications.

       It is not true, in so far as I know, that the Minister of Justice is
       planning to make it mandatory for similar forms to be included with
       each package of two or more rubber prophylactics.  Nor do I give any
       credence to the rumour that a one dollar postage stamp must be
       affixed to each form immediately after signature, and then the form
       must be mailed, before the activity consented to is performed, to
       her attention at the House of Commons or to a Suprem Court Justice
       of your choice.

       This program is free, use it in any way you wish, but please note
       that you use it, and the forms it produces, entirely at your own
       risk.

       The program has been, extensively tested, and worked both times.

       The forms have been tested five times, but unfortunately the results
       are not conclusive.  Two of the testers haven't come up for air
       since they got forms signed, two are still in hospital due to
       partner inflicted wounds, and one is on his honeymoon.  It is,
       nevertheless, hopeful to note that none of the testers are in jail.
