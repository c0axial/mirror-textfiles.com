                                By NEWELL JONES

        Discovery that  disease  organisms,  including  one  occurring in
   dread cancer, can be killed by bombarding  them with radio waves tuned
   to a particular length for each kind of organism, was claimed today by
   a San Diego scientist, Royal Raymond Rife, Pt. Loma.  He added that he
   had isolated this  cancer  organism but is not positive yet that it is
   the direct cause of the disease.

        The discovery promised fulfillment  of  man's  age-old hope for a
   specific destroyer of  all  his  infectious  diseases,  although  Rife
   avoided any claim  that he had established this yet.  He announced his
   work in the  conservative  manner   of  scientists,  but  his  reports
   indicated the great promise in their telling of successful bombardment
   of thousands of  cultures  of organisms, including  almost  all  kinds
   known to mankind.

        Organisms from   tuberculosis,   cancer,   sarcoma,   the   tumor
   resembling cancer but not so mortal  as  it;  streptococcus infection,
   typhoid fever, staphylococcus infection and two forms  of leprosy were
   among many which  the  scientist  reported are killed by the waves. He
   said that his laboratory experiments  indicated  that the method could
   be used successfully  and  safely,  in  organisms at  work  in  living
   tissues.

        "We do  not wish at this time," Rife commented," to claim that we
   have `cured' cancer, or any other disease, for that matter. But we can
   say that these  waves, or this `ray,'  as  the  frequencies  might  be
   called, have been shown to possess the power of de-vitalizing  disease
   organisms, of `killing'  them, when tuned to an exact, particular wave
   length, or frequency, for each different  organism.   This  applies to
   the organisms both  in  their free state and with certain  exceptions,
   when they are in living tissues."

                                EXCEPTIONS RARE

        The exceptions,  Rife  explained, came when some unsolved one may
   be just a harmonic of the other or  may have a frequency which only is
   a part of  a complex frequency.  Rife has recorded on  film  the  life
   span of many  germs.   One  of  the  microscopes  is equipped with two
   motion picture cameras and one still camera.

        Under extraordinary magnification  of the "universal" telesope, a
   germ has less privacy then the proverbial goldfish.  It is scrutinized
   from all sides  and  made  as  transparent  as  a cellophane  wrapper.
   Magnification is from 10,000 to 30,000 times.

        The many  adjustments  on the microscope make it possible to view
   the subject from all sides without  readjusting  the  focus, which, at
   such high magnifications, could not be regained.

                           5,800 PARTS IN MICROSCOPE

        There are 5,800 parts in the largest of the four microscopes. Its
   development parallels in  the  field of microscopes,  the  advancement
   expected in telescopic  construction  when Palomar's 200-inch "eye" is
   completed.

        Associated with Rife is a corps of scientists and experts, in the
   radio physics and medical fields.   The work to combat man's invisible
   enemies is coordinated to obtain the highest degree of perfection from
   each.

        Although the higher magnifications give excellent  definition and
   clearness, experimental work on viruses has required magnifications of
   only from 6,000 to 10,000.

                            CONSTRUCTION INTRICATE

        It is  difficult  for  the  layman  to  comprehend  Rife's highly
   technical explanation of  the  construction  of  his  instrument.   He
   explained that his  results  were  obtained by interposing  correcting
   prisms and blocks  of  quartz  not  more  than  30  millimeters apart,
   allowing only a tolerance of less then  one  core beam of illumination
   from the objective to the ocular.

        By applying this new system of optics and diminishing  protection
   between any two  prisms or blocks to 30 millimeters, it is possible to
   use objective lenses as oculars, giving  a  more highly corrected lens
   system than is possible with any standard type of ocular.

                  MICROSCOPE THAT MAGNIFIES 20,000 DIAMETERS
                            EXHIBITED BY SAN DIEGAN

                ( Source of news article and date is unknown )

        A new and unique type of microscope, designed and  constructed by
   Royal R. Rife,  Point  Loma scientist, and including within the single
   instrument practically all modern systems of microscopy, is on display
   in the Fine Arts gallery, in Balbon park.

        The apparatus, displayed "as  an  example  of  fine and beautiful
   craftsmanship," magnifies its field to 20,000 diameters.   It has 6000
   parts, weighs 200  pounds  and  stands  20  inches  high. It is highly
   polished with a chromium finish, a  new departure in Rife microscopes,
   which until now  have  been strictly utilitarian instruments  with  no
   attempt at beauty of appearance.

        Known as  the  Rife  Universal  microscope, the instrument can be
   used with the  dark  field,  mono-chromatic   and  transmitted  light,
   polarized light, opaque   illumination,   slit  ultra-microscope   and
   refractability of crystallography  systems of microscopic observation.
   It is also equipped for micro-photography, and photographs of subjects
   enlarged 20,000 diameters have been made, according to Rife.

        This machine is the third of  a  series  built  by  Rife  for the
   observation of filterable viruses.  Each has embodied  refinements and
   improvements over its  predecessor,  according  to  Rife,  and the new
   apparatus eliminates several tedious  steps  in  observation that were
   required by the older ones.  Its construction required  neary  nine(?)
   months.
