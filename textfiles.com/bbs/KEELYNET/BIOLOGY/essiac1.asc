               Why Hasn't This Cancer Cure Story Been Told?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------

    For more than  50  years  people  from  all over the world went to
    Ontario, Canada for cancer treatment  with a simple herbal formula
    that gave miraculous results.

    Why has this  important news failed to reach millions  of  vitally
    interested people?  The  story of ESSIAC should be part and parcel
    of the natural  healing lore of  North  America.   Instead  it  is
    virtually unknown today despite the fact that it performed so well
    against thousands of cases of terminal cancer that  it came within
    only three votes  of  being  legalized by the Canadian parliament.
    Still, chances are you have never heard of it.

    Now, thanks to APW, you will not  only  know  the whole story, you
    will know the secret ingredients of this herbal formula and how to
    get the herbs and make the tonic yourself.

    What price truth?  The medical monopoly and government proclaim to
    have spent billions  in search of a cure for cancer.   Except  for
    the jobs created,  the  "War  on  Cancer"  has been an utter flop.
    That great "war" began in 1970 with  President Nixon's appointment
    of Benno C. Schmidt as "Cancer Czar" and about twenty  years later
    some truly valuable  information  squeezed  out  when  the  cancer
    establishment finally admitted  that  the  standard  methods  used
    (chemotherapy, radiation, surgery) have lost the  war - they don't
    work.  That may be valuable information - but it's not good news.

    How valuable is  information  that  testifies to genuine victories
    against cancer?  There have been  several  widely  proclaimed, but
    suppressed therapies that indeed saved lives and restored health -
    Dr. Koch, Dr. Ivy, Dr. Gerson, Hoxey et al.  However,  one  of the
    greatest of these alternative cancer stories - the story of ESSIAC
    has not been openly told.  Such information should not be withheld
    from the people,  but until now, it has been!  You have a right to
    know that a  simple  herbal  remedy   was   credited   for  curing
    thousands, and for relieving the pain of more thousands  of  dying
    cancer patients.

    "There is a tragic and shameful irony in the ESSIAC tale," notes a

                                    Page 1

    Canadian magazine, "In  the  beginning, a simple herbal recipe was
    freely shared by an Indian who understood  that  the  blessings of
    the Creator belong to all."

    You have probably heard such shameful stories before.   How greedy
    individuals with power  over  the  cancer establishment suppressed
    possible cures because they, the  owners  of  that  establishment,
    could not have absolute control.  It happened in  the  case of Dr.
    William F. Koch, for example.

    The ESSIAC story is one that has not been widely circulated.  Even
    the various "alternative" circles in the United States know little
    if anything about  this  fantastic  herbal  remedy and the role it
    played for decades in Canada.

    APW heard the story and read Dr.  Gary  Glum's book "Calling of An
    Angel."  Then our  investigative  skills went to work.   The  well
    written and documented book actually raised more questions than it
    answered, and it  did  not  reveal  the  formula.  We learned that
    there are present  day  charges and  counter-charges  marring  the
    whole truth, and people with vested interests are  squabbling over
    rights to the formula which had been used so well by the late Rene
    Caisse.  This fabled   nurse  used  the  formula  unselfishly  for
    decades.  ESSIAC, in fact, is her name spelled backwards.

    So many terminally ill patients  became  well  again  that  public
    pressure forced the  Canadian Parliament to react  in  1939.   The
    medical monopoly pulled out all stops, yet ESSIAC came within only
    three votes of  becoming  a legal therapy for cancer.  The medical
    establishment won the war of politics  and propaganda - but helped
    lose the war on cancer.

    APW'S Tom Valentine probed the story behind the story,  and  found
    out the whole  truth  with the help of sincere people, doctors and
    laymen alike, who have no special axes to grind.

    Dr. Charles Brusch  of  the  famed  Brusch  Clinic  in  Cambridge,
    Massachusetts (physician to  John  F. Kennedy) - not  only  tested
    ESSIAC on human  patients,  but  proved  its value against his own
    cancer.  He continues proclaiming it's great value today.

    ESSIAC appears to be able to dissolve diabetes as well as cancer!

    ------------------------------------------------------------------

          Excerpts from the book "Calling of An Angel" follows  :

    "I decided that if I should ever  develop  cancer,"  Rene wrote in
    her brief autobiography, I WAS CANADA'S CANCER NURSE, that I would
    use this herbal  tea.  Then about a year later she  was  strolling
    with a wise  and  aged  doctor  when he stopped, took his cane and
    stroked a weed.  "Nurse Caisse,"  he  told  Rene, "if people would
    use this weed there would be little or no cancer in the world."

    The doctor told  her  the  name  of  the plant, Burdock  and  Rene
    realized that it  was one of the herbs the elderly woman had named
    as an ingredient in the medicine man's tea.

    Rene Caisse was a practical and sensible  woman, who was very busy

                                    Page 2

    with her nursing  career,  so  she didn't get excited  right  away
    about the fantastic story of the herbal remedy, and even after
    the doctor's statement  seemed  to  confirm  that  she  might have
    something worthwhile, she  didn't  experiment  or  bother  herself
    about the formula.

    Then her mother's sister was diagnosed with cancer  of the stomach
    and liver.  The  woman  was  given, at most, six months to live by
    her physician, R. O. Fisher, MD.

    Rene knew the doctor well, so she told him the story of the herbal
    tea and asked permission to give  it  a try under his observation.
    Since there was  apparently nothing else medical technology  could
    do, Dr. Fisher consented on the spot.

    "I obtained the  necessary  herbs,  with  some  difficulty,"  Rene
    wrote, "and made the tea."

    Rene put it succinctly in her book:  "My  aunt  lived for 21 years
    after being given  up  by the medical profession.   There  was  no
    recurrence of cancer."

    One could write  "needless to say" when describing the reaction by
    Dr. Fisher, but  when it comes to  cancer,  the  behavior  of  the
    medical profession is  anything  but  predictable.   However,  Dr.
    Fisher was, indeed,  impressed  with  what  he observed.  He asked
    Rene to treat other patients -- other "hopeless" cancer patients.

    Dr. Fisher spread the word to other  doctors  and  soon  Rene  was
    being asked to  treat  their "hopeless" patients as  well.   They,
    too, were impressed  with  the results.  By this time the year was
    1926.  The rate of cancer death in  the United States had risen to
    103 per 100,000!  Apparently, cancer was growing  in  the  general
    population very much like a malignant tumor.

    Obviously Rene became  very  attached  to the herbal formula.  She
    called it ESSIAC, which is Caisse spelled backwards.

    Of all the factors inherent in the bureaucratic syndrome that sets
    itself up within the structures  of  large  organizations, the NIH
    factor is among  the  most powerful of influences.   Not  invented
    here!

    This is not the only reason for the infamous "waivers" required by
    large corporations, but  it's  likely  the most sincere.  Legally,
    the deep pockets of large corporations  are  a target for nuisance
    lawsuits, so they must take great care with what  they  accept  or
    reject that comes  to  them from outsiders.  None of this is truly
    germane to Rene's case, however.

    The simplest fact is -- ESSIAC is not going to profit a large drug
    company, even if it is acknowledged as the "cure for cancer."

    Firstly, it would wipe out most  of  the  other  product sales and
    secondly there is no way a company can monopolize  a simple herbal
    tonic if the secret formula gets out.

    They could protect  the  formula  as Coca Cola has done, you might
    argue.  True, but why ruin all that  good  business  with the real

                                    Page 3

    thing?  Cancer may be deadly, but loss of economy is even deadlier
    in many a person's view.

    Rene really knew  better  than  to  try  soliciting the large drug
    companies, but she tried anyway.   Back  when  WWII broke out, she
    recalled the fact that ESSIAC had a way of stopping hemorrhages --
    the face cancer  case  for  example.   She wrote  to  Parke  Davis
    company in hopes  they  would  use  her  formula  to  help wounded
    servicement during the conflict.  No dice!  She wrote to Merck and
    to the Biochemical  Institute  at  the  University  of  Texas  and
    received frustration for her efforts.

    Finally, in 1973  at  the  age  of  85  Rene Caisse  tried  Sloan-
    Kettering one more  time.   Perhaps  she was stimulated by all the
    hype for President Richard Nixon's  "War on Cancer," program where
    the rich within the cancer establishment were going to get richer.

    The Laetrile controversy was in full bloom and Sloan-Kettering was
    in the middle.  Many people today, including the man who served as
    the public relations officer for Sloan-Kettering,  Dr. Ralph Moss,
    are conviced that  the "tests" for any efficacy with Laetrile were
    rigged to fail.

    Dr. Chester Stock,  who  figured   prominently   in  the  Laetrile
    squabble by the nature of his position, responded  to Rene that if
    she would send ESSIAC, they would again test it.

    Rene sent Sloan-Kettering one of the herbs -- probably the Burdock
    Root -- because  it  is  the  apparent tumor regressor.  The other
    three are blood purifiers and symbiotic  support  substances.  She
    also gave them  careful instruction on how to prepare  and  inject
    the material.

    Results of their   tests   were   never  released.   Maybe  future
    inspection of the archives at Sloan-Kettering  may  tell the truth
    about the results of the animal experiments.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------

    The ESSIAC formula : 6 & 1/2  cups of Burdock Root (cut)
                         16 ounces     of Sheep Sorrel herb (powder)
