       I am always  interested  in anything that expands human capabilities
       and human abilities. This artical  in  The  Whole Earth Review (Fall
       1991) is extremely applicable to this end, that is;  extending human
       perception. The artical  is  entitled  "Nightwalking:  Exploring the
       Dark with Peripheral Vision", by Nelson Zink and Stephen Parks.
       ____________________________________________________________________

       It all began one afternoon a couple  of  years ago.  We were talking
       about people who have the ability to see farther or  more  deeply or
       more clearly than  the rest of us, those exceptional individuals who
       can easily master complexity and ambiguity  and  arrive at startling
       insights.

       We began to speculate on the possibility that these  people  weren't
       just smarter or  more  creative  than the average person but perhaps
       literally saw the world in a different  manner.   As  we  looked for
       direct connections between  the literal and figurative  meanings  of
       words like sight  and vision, it slowly became apparent that we were
       onto something. We reviewed the physiology  of  sight and discovered
       that neural structures  exist  within  the  eye  and   begin   which
       facilitate a way of seeing that is radically dissimilar from the one
       we're accustomed to  using.   We  confirmed that there is, indeed, a
       neurological basis for a distinct  "second"  type of sight, and that
       this way of seeing is available to all of us all the time.  (Usually
       we are so absorbed with our focused vision that we're unaware of its
       power.)

                                 Perpheral vision.

       Could peripheral vision possibly be related to Vision,  to  Insight,
       to all those   capitalized  powers  of  perception?   Searching  for
       references that might shed light  on  second  sight,  we  found that
       while many individuals  weren't  particularly  aware   of  how  they
       accomplished their achievements,    the   reports   contained   eery
       similarities.  We found a succession  of  texts  from the Taoists of
       early China through the books of Carlos Castaneda  that  spoke  of a
       certain kind of   all-seeing   gaze.   It  was  often  difficult  to
       determine whether the   authors    were    speaking   literally   or
       metaphorically, but it was perfectly clear in the case  of  Miyamoto
       Muksashi, the legendary  swordsman  of  fifteenth century Japan, who
       had the clearest and most insightful  description  of  the powers of
       peripheral vision we found.

                                      Page 1

       In The Book  of Five Rings, Musashi refers to the two types of sight
       which he calls Ken and Kan.  Ken registers  the movements of surface
       phenomena; it's the observation of superficial appearence.   Kan  is
       the profound examination of the essence of things, seeing through or
       into.  For  Musashi, Ken is seeing with the eyes, Kan is seeing with
       the mind.

       The difference is  akin  to that of style verses substance.  Musashi
       gives instructions for developing  Kan  sight:  "It  is important to
       observe both sides without moving the eyes.  It is no good trying to
       learn this kind of thing in great haste.  Always be watchful in this
       manner and under   no   circumstances   alter    your    point    of
       concentration."

       While Musashi certainly  didn't  understand the physiology of sight,
       he was acutely aware of the difference  between cone and rod vision.
       We reviewed the science of vision and read that the  retina  of  the
       human eye is composed of three distinct areas: the fovea, macula and
       peripheral region. Each  area performs a distinctive visual function
       and contributes to the sense we call sight.  Because these different
       functions operate simultaneously  and  blend  into  each other, they
       aren't normally differentiated.

       The fovea is a small circular pit in the center of the retina packed
       with an unbelievable   concentration  (160,000  cells   per   square
       millimeter, an area  about  the size of the head of a pin) of color-
       sensitive receptor cells called  cones,  each  with  its  own  nerve
       fiber.  The fovea  enables  the average person to see  most  sharply
       within a cercle  less  than  an  eighth  of an inch in diameter at a
       distance of twelve inches from the eye.

       Surrounding the fovea is the macula, an oval body of color-sensitive
       cells.  Macular vision is quite clear, but not as clear and sharp as
       foveal vision, because the cones  aren't  as  closely packed as they
       are in the  fovea.   We  use  the  macula  for reading  or  watching
       television, among other things.

       Moving away from the central portin of the retina, the character and
       quality if vision  changes  radically.   The  capacity  to see color
       diminishes as the color-sensitive  cones become more scattered. Fine
       vision associated with  closely  packed  cones, each  with  its  own
       neuron, shifts to a coarser vision in which two hundred or more of a
       different type of  receptor cell - the rods -are each connected to a
       single neuron.  The effect of the  connections  between  rods  is to
       amplify the perception  of  motion  and  light  while  reducing  the
       capacity for distinguishing detail.

       For our purposes,  we  began  to think of the retina as divided into
       two areas: the fovea and macula,  both  with  high concentrations of
       cones, and the periphery, where rods predominate  -  in  short, cone
       and rod vision,  responsible respectively for focused and peripheral
       vision.  A quick  way  of understanding  the  extent  of  these  two
       regions of sight is to extend your fists directly in  front, side by
       side.  Your fists cover the approximate area normally seen by cones;
       the rest of  your  visual  field is largely rod mediated.  Thus it's
       apparent that only a small percentage  of  our total visual field is
       clearly focused.  Attending only to this region results  in  what is
       commonly called tunnel vision - figuratively and literally, as we've
       come to believe.

                                      Page 2

       It became evident  to  us  that  many  of the special perceptions we
       sought came from the ability to observe the world and ourselves from
       a "different point of view," in a broader, unfettered context.

       In time the obvious struck us, that the experience of insight, rapid
       learning, invention, creativity,   intuition,   and   perhaps   even
       personal change have a direct connection with second  sight, a sight
       dependent almost completely  on  the brain's capacity for processing
       peripheral vision.

       We decided to  try to develop a technique  which  would  effectively
       stimulate which would  effectively  stimulate this  special  way  of
       seeing.  After some  trial  and  error we originated an exercise and
       designed a simple piece of equipment  which  seemed  to  enhance our
       access to decond sight.

       On the bill of a baseball cap we mounted a metal rod welded to
       a binder clip, extending about a foot in front of our  eyes.  On the
       tip of each  rod  we  glued  a small bead of plastic resin about the
       size of a baby green pea.  This created  a  fixed  point on which to
       focus.  We reasoned that with our focused vision  on  the  bead, any
       physical activity would necessitate the use of peripheral vision.

                                 We chose hiking.

       We drove out  into  the  countryside  near our homes in northern New
       Mexico, found a place where we wouldn't  be  interrupted, donned our
       caps and set  out.  In the beginning, disoriented  and  functionally
       blind, we made  our way cautiously along an old jeep trail.  Soon we
       noticed that our feet seemed to know  what  to  do.  We stepped over
       and around obstacles on the ground without consciously being able to
       see them.  It became apparent that our non-conscious minds could see
       the ground directly on front of us perfectly well.

       Within an hour  our  field  of vision began to clear,  and  we  both
       became engrossed with  the  phenomenon  of  seeing  double.  Walking
       behind, one could  watch  two  identical  people  moving  up  ahead,
       walking side by side, each making identical movements.   A  sort  of
       Zen paradox arose as to which was the real one.  We later understood
       that the solution  to  this  and  other  "reality"  paradoxes was an
       important part of learning to use and trust second sight.

       As we walked we began to notice that  other  senses such as hearing,
       balance and touch naturally expanded and became more  acute,  as  if
       we'd gradually become  conscious  of the peripheral regions of these
       senses too.  Concurrently, the perception  of "weight" shifted lower
       in our bodies, to the hips and on down to our feet.

       After a couple  of  hours  of  walking along the road  we  began  to
       experience a deep  sense  of  relaxation.   We noticed our hands had
       warmed considerably, an   indication   that   stimulation   of   the
       parasympathetic nervous system was somehow related to the experience
       of second sight.

       Each time we have walked (probably a hundred times  by now), a sense
       of deep calm  has  been  experienced.  It took a while to understand
       what was going on, but our theory  is  this:  Walking  while relying
       only on second sight requires that the conscious mind trust the non-
       conscious, and this  inter-mind trust is the essence  of  relaxation
       itself.
                                      Page 3

       On the next  few  outings  we  picked  steeper  grades  and  rougher
       terrain.  We found we could easily control fatigue and pain by using
       an application of will - focusing  attention on the tired body part,
       for instance, and  moving  the  discomfort  off  to   the  edges  of
       awareness, virtually the  same process as moving our attention about
       in the great field of peripheral vision without moving our eyes.

       In our reading we had been reminded  that  in  darkness,  peripheral
       (rod) vision is far superior to focused (cone) vision.  Night vision
       relies almost entirely  on  rods,  which  because  of  their  neural
       connections and physical  makeup  are very sensitive to light.  Rods
       need about thirty minutes of dark  or  dim  red  light  to  activate
       fully, and then, it is claimed, they have the capacity  to  detect a
       single photon - the equivalent, in clear air, of detecting the flame
       of a candle that is ten miles away.

       In the dark, cones are for the most part visually useless, and so we
       figured that walking  in the dark woukd force us to become even more
       dependent on peripheral vision. It was time to up the ante.

       We modified the  headgear by painting  the  beads  with  luminescent
       paint and increased our daily intake of Vitamin A (necessary for the
       formation of visual purple, a substance which enables  the  eyes  to
       adjust from bright  light  to  darkness)  to 50,000 IU for a week to
       make sure we weren't deficient.

       We picked an area where we hadn't  walked  before  and  started  out
       around sunset.  For  the first hour of walking we  noticed  all  the
       familiar inner shifts  and  sensations.   And then something strange
       happened:  we entered  the  night.   We  really  don't  have  better
       description.  When it  became apparent that we could  see  perfectly
       well, the night  became  alive.   Rabbits  hopped by, nighthawks and
       bats flew past to check us out.  Our  steps got lighter, walking was
       approaching the status of flight.  We felt like we'd  fully  entered
       the experience of second sight.

       Other senses expanded   even  more  than  we'd  experienced  before.
       Balance became much more sensitive.  Later we developed a very slow-
       waking kind of  Tai  Chi  just to  enjoy  this  exquisite  sense  of
       balance.  Our skin  started to feel peculiar, more "solid"  perhaps,
       and we found  we  could walk comfortably in quite chilly air without
       any clothes.  Probably due to our  increased  ability to concentrate
       and the air  qualities  of  night,  hearing  and smell  were  vastly
       improved.  As we  became  proficient at seeing in the dark, we found
       that we could run down arroyos and  climb steep banks in the dead of
       night, all the while focusing on the luminescent  beads.   With  the
       calm of Nightwalking,  we  discovered  that  anxiety and fear of the
       dark, so common in our culture, are effectively eliminated.

       Fear, anxiety and even physical pain  are  seemingly associated with
       focused vision, while peripheral processes engender  relaxation  and
       delight, a state we have half-seriously dubbed Sense-Surround.

       A friend heard  what  we  were  doing and tipped us off to Alexandra
       David-Neel, who for some years studies  and  toured  in  Tibet.   In
       Magic and Mystery  in  Tibet, she describes her encounter  with  and
       investigation of Lung-gom-pas,    Tibetan   spiritual   walkers   of
       extraordinary ability.  According  to  David-Neel,  "The walker must
       nerther speak, nor look from side to side.  He must keep his eyes

                                      Page 4

       fixed on a  single  object  and  never  allow  this  attention to be
       attracted by anything else.  When the trance state has been reached,
       though normal consciousness is for  the  greater part suppressed, it
       remains sufficiently alive to keep the walker aware of the obstacles
       in his way and mindful of his direction and goal."  We  felt in good
       company.

       Nightwalking became one   of  the  most  consistently  relaxing  and
       exhilarating experiences either of  us  had  ever had.  The reports,
       ancient and modern, turned out to be true - employing  second  sight
       did facilitate a   distinct   change  in  perciption  and  sense  of
       wellbeing.  Not only were we learning  to travel freely in the dark;
       it was becoming  apparent  that  this capability connected  us  more
       directly to the non-conscious.  Far from being a storehouse of fear,
       we found it  an  incredible  protector,  dedicated to our safety and
       happiness.

       Just to make sure we weren't doing  something that might cause undue
       eye strain, we thought it might be wise to take an  optometrist on a
       Nightwalk.  We contacted   a  respected  Santa  Fe  pracitioner  who
       initially sounded sleptical but agreed to join us.

       Not only did he give us a clean bill  of  health,  but by the end of
       his first walk  he  was  speculating  about  the possible  value  of
       Nightwalking in treating myopia.

       We began wondering  whether Nightwalking would prove as exciting and
       useful for others as it did for us.   So we planned a training which
       was divided into four sessions of about three hours  each,  covering
       varions terrains and their attendant challenges.

       The first group  of a dozen trainees assembled shortly after sundown
       in the dry stream bed of the Rio  de  oa  Truchas, on Bureau of Land
       Management land between  Santa  Fe  and Taos.  Hats  and  rods  were
       passed out along  with  simple  instructions:  Watch the rod tip and
       keep it up near the horizon, walk  slowly  and  start  to notice the
       scenery to the sides as you pass by.  With a sense  of  mystery  and
       excitement this first  group  set  out, walking single-file into the
       twilight.

       Musashi had given instructions for  a  particular  kind of stance to
       practice while using second sight.  We had fiddled  with it early on
       but found that  the  stance  came naturally while engaging in second
       sight.  We wondered if people would  automatically adopt this stance
       as they became more proficient at Nightwalking.   They  did,  and we
       found we could  tell  if  a particular person was using second sight
       just by watching their walk.

       After the third session everyone could run over the rocks and gravel
       in dry stream beds in the dark using  only  second  sight.   By  the
       fourth session members  of the group could take the  lead  and  find
       their way unerringly  on  the  darkest of dark nights.  After twelve
       hours of practice, virtually every  one  in  the  group  could enter
       second sight at will, which had taken us about a year  to figure out
       and master.  After  the  training  we queried participants about the
       lasting effects of the experience.   Most of them reported shifts in
       their worldly perception  and  daily  lives.  Several  commented  on
       their increased ability  to  quiet  "brain  chatter."  Virtually all
       walkers said their awareness of the world around them was broadened,

                                      Page 5

       and they were  less  "stuck"  in their heads.  As someone in a later
       group aptly pointed put: "This is  really  about  convergence.  It's
       about taking a  whole  bunch  of  things  that  are  semi-clear  and
       converging them into a single crystalline vision."

                               TIPS ON NIGHTWALKING

       For people living   outdoors,  peripheral  vision  is  critical  for
       staying alive.  It may be time to  rediscover  it.   Here  are a few
       tips.  Fix yourself a modified cap and adjust it so  the  rod tip is
       directly in line  with  your nose at eye level.  Focus on the tip as
       you walk around your house.  Then try walking around the yard.

       Avoid places where  there  may be  traffic  or  drop-offs.   In  the
       beginning your vision will seem blurred.  Pay attention to the total
       field of vision, far to the sides and up and down.  Slowly you'll be
       able to perceive a fairly clear field of vision with only the center
       (cone vision) blurred,  doubled in fact.  As your  field  of  vision
       begins to clear  take it as an indication that you're switching over
       to second sight.

       Later you can begin to examine elements  in  your field of vision by
       simply moving your attention to them.  Notice that we say attention,
       not eyes.  Your eyes should remain constantly on the tip of the rod.
       This is really  what  second sight is about, using  just  peripheral
       vision and the  mind  to gather and process visual information.  The
       first part will take about three  hours,  the  second about the same
       length of time.

       By keeping your eyes focused on the rod tip while walking,  you will
       eventually break two  strong  visual  habits  - relying only on cone
       vision and moving the eyes to new  points of interest.  Find a place
       to walk in the dark which is out of the range of artificial lights.

                Pick a night with little or no moon; take a friend.

       Because of the  rods'  extreme  sensitivity to light,  you  may  see
       unusual light phenomena.   Some  of  this  is  imaginary,  caused by
       "overcharging" of unused optic nerves, the rest results from natural
       or bioluminescence.  Over time Nightwalking  sensitizes  the eye and
       brain, so some of what you see may surprise you.  We've become aware
       of light-emitting bacteria in rotting logs and along  the  veins  of
       certain plants.  Fireflies  seem like strobe lights.  Glow worms are
       blinding.  A quarter moon rising on a clear night can bring tears to
       your eyes with its brightness.
