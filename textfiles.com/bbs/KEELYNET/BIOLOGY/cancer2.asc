                Electron Sensitive Membranes and their Role in the
                                Formation of Cancer

       As a general  rule,  every  cell  in  your body is operating under a
       system of "feedback control."  A  control  system  of  this  type is
       frequently found among living cells.

       In trying to  explain  the complexity of living cells,  perhaps  the
       best approach is  to  simply say that the thermostat in your home is
       much like the feedback mechanisms in cells.

       Without actually analyzing the components in detail, it is sufficent
       to know that  parts  of each cell  normally  function  together,  in
       reacting to whatever environment the cell is normally found in.

       Secondly, DNA is the genetic apparatus which controls  the functions
       and activities of  the living cell.  That is, the same DNA is active
       in each columnar epithelial cell  which  lines  the intestine of any
       given individual, as shown above.

       And as a  general  rule,  it  is the "regular orientation"  or  "the
       standardized activity" of  the  DNA  in  each  of those cells  which
       enables them to work in a regular, stablized manner.

                        WHY ALL THE CONFUSION ABOUT CANCER?

       It has been difficult for researchers  to  understand  how  a  given
       tissue has the  ability to order, and/or properly  restore  its  own
       cells.

       It is only  now  being recognized and published, by Neu Facts, Inc.,
       that normal cells  must  communicate  with  each  other  by  way  of
       Electron Sensitive Membrane Proteins.

       These "ESM Proteins," in turn, are linked into the feed-back control
       systems, at various  levels  of activity, in each cell.  Since  each
       cell as shown  above,  is operating under the same active DNA , then
       it is also true that the same "ESM  Proteins"  must  exist along the
       sides of every one of those cells.

       Hence, each cell  in any given tissue is normally  linked,  via  its
       "ESM Proteins," to  the  common  information  content of every other
       cell.

                                      Page 1





       When you put  cells into a regular laboratory culture however, these
       cell-to-cell communications are   evidentily  no  longer  active  or
       essential.  The entire  system  fails  when  each   cell  begins  to
       function on an independent basis.

                          THE DANGER OF A "HIGH-FAT DIET.

       It is easy  to  see  how  fats, and especially poly-unsaturated oils
       play an important part in all this.   They  are difficult to digest.
       The fats also coat the membrane surface of the intestinal cells.

       And if ANY  laboratory animal is put on a high fat  diet,  mouse  or
       rat, it will  spontaneously  develop  a  cancer  and it is usually a
       cancer of the colon!

       1/24/1990

       The results of a high fat diet links  perfectly  to the issue of the
       "ESM Proteins.  The  key  factor  is  the  difficulty   which  cells
       experience in degrading fats.

       As the levels  of  undigestible  fat  climb, it is obvious that they
       physically limit regular "ESM Protein" activity.

       Hence, the functionally  connected   feedback   system  of  cellular
       regulation is increasingly potentiated to fail. It poses a serious
       problem.

       Abnormal growth occurs if a cell (or cells) CAN NO  LONGER  SEND OUT
       an electronic signal  TO  CONFIRM ITS PRESENCE among the other cells
       of a given  tissue.    When this  happens  in  colon  cancers,  most
       Doctor's know what usually takes place.

       A small group of unnecessary cells starts growing first.  These form
       what is known as a polyp.

       Assume, for the   moment,   that  the  cells  normal   ESM   Protein
       performance has been  altered  by the fats and that the cells normal
       communications system has failed in  some of the cells on both sides
       of the long arrow in the drawing above.

       The other cells start dividing!  They are designed  to reproduce but
       now they are  attempting  to replace WHAT IS MISTAKENLY PERCEIVED TO
       BE DEAD OR otherwise MISSING, neighbor cells.  A glob of fat has won
       a very tiny battle, but the real war doesn't stop there.

       Those cells will continue to grow  until  the neck of that same area
       of cells is totally closed off.   And as the enclosed cells continue
       to grow, they will cause further problems.

       If the patient is fortunate, by seeing a Doctor when the first signs
       of bleeding occur,  the  polyps can be surgically removed.   Then  a
       small sample of  those  cells,  from  the  polyps,  are  sent  to  a
       laboratory.

       Once examined under a microscope,  if  there  are  no abnormal cells
       growing among those cells, the growth will be declared  "benign," or
       harmless.

       The Doctor's say,  "We caught it just in time."  What this means is:
       the genetic apparatus of those cells (the DNA) seems to be in good
       working order, and a great many cells were in one place where only a
       few should have been.

                        What Makes Cancer Cells Different?

       The abnormal operation of the cell's DNA, is the critical factor and
       once again that issue is linked to high dietary fats.

       In January, 1971,  M.  J. Hill and associates of St. Mary's Hospital
       Medical School in  London,  England,  discovered  that  certain  gut
       bacteria might play  an  important  part in the emergence  of  colon
       cancers, based on studies on cancer prone populations.

       In August of  that  same year the same researchers reported that one
       of the same bacteria that they had  suspected  to be somehow able to
       initiate colon cancers, was also active in breast cancers.

       That bacteria, reported  to  be  a "normal component  of  the  human
       intestinal flora" was lecithinase-negative clostridia and they BREAK
       DOWN FATS.

       In the process,  they  also  produce  two very powerful "look alike"
       female hormones.  Furthermore, it  is  known that the hormone levels
       in man drop, due to extreme stress, or when an individual passes the
       normal reproductive stages.  Evidently, that's when  these  bacteria
       really bloom.

       Researchers have found  that  excessive amounts of hormones (estrone
       and estradiol), are carried by post-menopausal women with breast
       cancer.

       In addition, other tissues have been  found  to  "behave like target
       organs" for these estrogens, such as the uterus, the vagina, and the
       pituitary.  Cancers emerge  there  and  the same bacteria  is  found
       there in limited numbers.

       Many other reports  in  the  medical  literature  note that a hidden
       relationship exists between clostridium,  cancer,  and  the hormones
       which clostridium  produce.

                        -  How Does It All Fit Together?  -

       The initial cancer  cell  emerges when the key features  of  regular
       FEEDBACK CONTROL are LOST, MASKED or DROPPED.

       It may be  due  to  radiation,  a  cancer  causing  chemical, or the
       transfer of foreign DNA from a bacteria.  The cell's own DNA becomes
       altered, or infected with the bacteria's foreign DNA.

       The bacteria are smaller than a dot  on  this  screen  or printed on
       this page, but  their  DNA causes a significant change  in  the  ESM
       Protein of the affected cell.

       Once the DNA is transferred, normal cell-to-cell communications fail
       and the reordered DNA enables the cancer cell to live and operate on
       the bacteria's ESM Proteins.


                                      Page 3





       The cell's normal  ESM  Proteins  are  lost.   And the body's immune
       system did not detect the ESM Proteins  of  the bacteria, so it will
       not detect the cancer cells either!

       It is also important to note these things:

            1. Researchers  have  had such a problem with  cancers  because
               NONE of  the cancer cell features have ever fallen under the
               ordinary rules of bacteriology and disease.

            2. The millions of cells, which  make up each cancer, have each
               unfolded WITH  THE  SAME  PROPERTIES of the  first,  initial
               cancer cell.

            3. The   altered   DNA   reorganizes  membrane  features  which
               obviously lends themselves  to  a  flexible and unstabilized
               range of activities, relative to a tissue's ability to order
               and/or properly restore it's own numbers.

           4.  The  bacteria  involved  in  each  cancer   can   be  easily
               identified because  they  normally  exist  among  the cancer
               cells which  some  of their  own  DNA,  in  part,  initially
               produced, and

            5. these bacteria also produce hormone sensitive  cancers, such
               as breast cancers, via "hormone carriers" which transport or
               move the  offending  DNA  through the host's blood stream to
               the hormone-sensitive cells.

       Vangard Note....

            Most researchers are aware of  how oil effects electricity.  It
            acts as  an  insulator due to its exceedingly  high  dielectric
            value.

            This coating of oil acts as an insulator which in turn PREVENTS
            the SENSING  of  cells  BY  OTHER CELLS.  Replicate then occurs
            WITHOUT THE  GUIDANCE of the  controlling  chemical  and  IONIC
            (read electrical) interchanges.

            A most interesting discovery and hypothesis which might help to
            explain some  of  the  seemingly  miraculous   and  spontaneous
            "cures" of  cancer.  Remissions have occurred after such simple
            actions as altering the environment or diet.

            If this ESM Protein hypothesis is true and the agglomeration of
            fat on the walls of the cells  is  of  sufficient  quantity  as
            brought about through a fatty diet, then it  follows  that  the
            cells could lose touch with the master controller of that organ
            or system.

            If true,  the  concept  leads  to  new  possibilities  for  the
            treatment of  cancer  as  well   as  a  complete  and  thorough
            re-examination of old and unorthodox techniques in light of the
            ESM Protein theory.
