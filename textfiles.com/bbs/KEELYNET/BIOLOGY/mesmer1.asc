                               The "New Mesmerism"

                         Taken from Scientific American
                                February 25, 1893

       Within the past  few  months most wonderful tales have appeared from
       time to time  in  the  daily  press   concerning   certain  mesmeric
       performances in the Paris hospitals.

       It was gravely  stated that Dr. Luys, of La Charite'  Hospital,  had
       obtained such a development of hypnotic suggestion as to bring about
       a transference of sensibility to inanimate objects.

       For example, a   person  in  the  hypnotic  state  would  receive  a
       suggestion that a glass of water was part of himself and was capable
       of sensation.  Then the glass would  be  taken out of his sight, and
       when the contained water was agitated the patient would  be  visibly
       disturbed or even give evidence of acute suffering.

       Other inanimate ob ects  were capable of receiving like impressions,
       and there was  apparent danger that  this  "externalization  of  the
       sensations," as it  was  called,  would come to be  regarded  as  an
       accepted fact by  not  a  few  prominent  scientific  men  with more
       imagination and credulity than sound common sense.

       Mr. Ernest Hart, when in Paris recently,  had his attention drawn to
       these seemingly astounding manifestations of occult  force,  and was
       so impressed with  what  he  saw  that he determined to seek out the
       cause.

       It took him but a very short time  to see that the subjects of these
       hypnotic experiments were impudent impostors, and that Dr.  Luys was
       the victim of gross fraud.

       He suggested to the doctor the employment of certain  simple  tests,
       such as the substitution of inert substances for the drugs in sealed
       tubes which were supposed to act upon the subjects when brought near
       the body.

       Dr. Luys, however, declined to act upon this suggestion, saying that
       he could perform  the  experiments  only in his own way, and if they
       failed to convince he could only express his regret.


                                      Page 1





       Mr.  Hart then  procured the attendance of five of these subjects in
       his own apartments and repeated the experiments in the presence of a
       number of Parisian and foreign medical men.

       The same phenomena,  he says,  in  a  communication  to  the  London
       Times, "were produced  with sham magnets, with substituted  figures,
       with misnamed medicinal  substances,  and  with distilled water, and
       with sham 'suggestion,' opposite suggestion, or none at all.

       Every one was able to convince himself that all the results so shown
       were, without exception, simulated, fictitious, and fraudulent.

       That some of the patients were hypnotic  and  hysterical  in  a high
       degree does not alter the fact that from beginning  to  end they all
       showed themselves to  be tricksters of the most barefaced kind; some
       of them very clever actors, possessing  dramatic  powers which might
       have been turned to better purposes, most of them utterly  venal and
       some of them  confessing  that they played upon the credulity of Dr.
       Luys for their own purposes."

       It is strange to think that men of  scientific  medical training can
       be so thoroughly  duped  in  this closing decade of  the  nineteenth
       century, and we  may well pause to ask ourselves whether, after all,
       the world is any less credulous that  it was in the good old days of
       witchcraft and diabolism.

       There may be a greater number of hard-headed skeptics  abroad, but a
       large portion of  mankind  is  still hungry for the incomprehensible
       and the supernatural,  and  as religious  faith  wanes  superstition
       seems but to take a firmer hold on certain minds.

       Vangard Notes...

            This most  interesting  article caught our attention  while  we
            were going through some very old SCIENTIFIC AMERICANS at a flea
            market.  Needless  to  say, we bought about $50 worth to add to
            our collection.

            As to hypnosis, there are several  interesting  phenomena which
            don't seem  to  be  generally  known.  One is SYNESTHESIA,  the
            confusion or  blending  of senses.  Another is something called
            NEGATIVE HALLUCINATIONS.

            The above article seems to be  related to SYNESTHESIA since the
            senses are extended to establish a "rapport" with  an inanimate
            object.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       SYNESTHESIA

            John W. Keely, namesake of KeelyNet from which this file comes,
            said that a "cerebellic field" could be established which would
            allow the operator to establish a "sympathetic attendant."

            Now the cerebellic field pretty much speaks for itself but what
            of this sympathetic attendant?


                                      Page 2





            Keely says  it  can  best  be  described as an extension of the
            NERVOUS SYSTEM to allow some  mysterious blending of our psyche
            and subsequent mental control to that of anything to which this
            attendant had  been established.  (see VEDA1.ASC  or  .ZIP  for
            information on the Krell Helmet)

            Of course,  as a baby must map its environment and learn how to
            control its appendages under  mental  direction,  so  must  the
            operator or  experimenter  in  such  fields as  this  learn  to
            "influence" the object.

            Not only  must  the  rapport  be  established,  but the correct
            signals must be learned to enable intelligent control.

       NEGATIVE HALLUCINATIONS

            In our researches into mesmerism  and  hypnotic  phenomena,  we
            came across a story from a book on "EXPERIMENTAL HYPNOTISM."

            A hypnotist was invited to a party (ostensibly as a guest),
            the same as how pickup owners have "lots of friends."

            At the party, someone brings up that the guy is  a hynotist, so
            they coerce  him  into  doing  some  party  tricks.   After the
            standard fare, they decide to try a "post-hypnotic suggestion."

            A woman is selected and placed  under  hypnosis.   She is given
            the suggestion  that  on  awakening, she will  continue  as  if
            nothing happened.    However,  when  the  hypnotist  snaps  his
            fingers, she will be unable to see her boyfriend.

            While the woman is under, the  boyfriend  leaves  the room.  On
            awakening the woman, she resumes her conversations  with  other
            people with  the  crowd  discretely observing her actions.  She
            showed no unusual patterns, even when the hypnotist snapped his
            fingers.

            The boyfriend was cued to enter  the  room.  When he did so, he
            had one hand behind his back.

            The woman  looked  up  and  over toward the doorway  where  her
            boyfriend stood.    She  was  obviously  surprised  and  seeing
            something.  Everyone thought the experiment a failure since she
            obviously was seeing her boyfriend.

            When asked what she saw, the woman replied, "Don't you see that
            rose FLOATING IN THE AIR?"

            The boyfriend had decided to  suprise  her  with  a  rose, this
            totally unbeknownst to anyone in the room.

            The woman, under the post-hypnotic command that  she  could not
            see her   boyfriend,   SAW   COMPLETELY  THROUGH  HIM,  A  ROSE
            "SUSPENDED" IN THE AIR!

            Of course,  the  hypnotist   and  crowd  were  amazed  at  this
            unexpected turn of events.

            This little experiment offers some fascinating possibilities.

            I told  the  story  to Vendyl Jones (the researcher looking for
            the Ashes of the Red Heifer  and  the  Ark  of  the Covenant in
            Israel) as a possible means of "seeing" through earth.

            He was intrigued but of course, the effect must  be  duplicated
            and proven before trying it in the field.

            How about if you were hunting for lost treasure?  Could you not
            see the earth as "glass"?

            In coincidence  with  this  phenomenon, could we not "tune" the
            thoughts to the "signature"  of  a  SPECIFIC  ITEM FOR WHICH WE
            WERE LOOKING?,  which would now be the object to which the body
            would "home".

            Not to mention the applications to crime resolution  by  remote
            viewing or viewing of past events "psychometry".  From there we
            can go into prediction and a host of other areas.
