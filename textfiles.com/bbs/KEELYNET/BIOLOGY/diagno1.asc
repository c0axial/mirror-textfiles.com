       Association, Washington, DC  20006, Tel. 202/857-0244)

       After  five days of suffering a miserable sore  throat,  you
       find yourself in your doctor's office.   Your doctor  thinks
       you  may  have strep throat,  a serious bacterial  infection
       that,  if  left  untreated.  can lead to  kidney  and  heart
       disease.

       The doctor swabs your throat,  sends the specimen to a labo-
       ratory  for analysis,  and three days later you know if  you
       have strep throat.   Meanwhile, the doctor is unsure whether
       or  not  to prescribe an antibiotic to fight the  infection.
       But  if the doctor could detect strep throat while  you  are
       still in the office, appropriate treatment could begin imme-
       diately.

       Now,  because of the diagnostic applications of biotechnolo-
       gy,  doctors  can identify strep throat,  right in their of-
       fices, in a matter of minutes.

       The  first step in treating or curing any disease or  infec-
       tion  is  diagnosis,  and  the  diagnostic  applications  of
       biotechnology   extend  far  beyond  strep  throat.    Heart
       disease,  cancer,  AIDS, cystic fibrosis, kidney disease and
       sickle-cell anemia are just some of the areas for which  the
       biotechnology  industry  has been developing new  diagnostic
       tools.

       This  article discusses the latest advances  in  diagnostics
       and looks at where applications of biotechnology are headed.


       DISCOVERY OF DNA AND CELL FUSION TECHNOLOGIES

       The  origin of DNA technology can be traced to the mid-1800s
       and  the  work  of  Gregor  Mendel,  an  Austrian  monk  and
       botanist.   His  work  with pea plants uncovered  the  first
       evidence that genetic traits were passed from generation  to
       generation.

       In the early 1900s, biologists discovered that humans obeyed
       the  same basic laws of heredity expressed in Mendel's work.
       THey  found  that  conditions  such  as  hemophilia,   color
       blindness  and  baldness were passed from  parent  to  child
       through  chromosomes,  the  components of every living  cell

                                        Page 1





       that contain genetic information.

       By the early 1950s, scientists developed an understanding of
       the workings of DNA,  or deoxyribonucleic acid, the molecule
       that carries the genetic information for all living systems.

       In  the  early  1970s,  genetic engineering  entered  a  new
       frontier.   Scientists  created new genetic instructions  by
       combining  segments of DNA from different  organisms.   This
       process is called gene splicing, or recombinant DNA.

       At the same time,  other scientists focused their  attention
       on  monoclonal antibodies.   Antibodies are produced in  the
       body by white blood cells.  They locate (and assist the body
       in  attacking)  bacteria,  viruses,  cancer cells and  other
       foreign   substances.    Monoclonals  are  highly   specific
       versions of the antibodies.

       But  it  wasn't until the  mid-1970s,  when  two  scientists
       discovered  how to mass produce monoclonals,  that their use
       as  diagnostic  (and also therapeutic) tools began  to  take
       shape.   By fusing, in a laboratory petri dish, an antibody-
       producing white blood cell with a cancer cell that  produces
       unlimited  generations of cells,  the scientists developed a
       method  to produce increased and consistent quantities of  a
       particular monoclonal antibody.  This manipulation is called
       hybridoma technology.

       Using monoclonals in diagnostic tests requires scientists to
       produce  the  purest quality  of these  specific  antibodies
       possible.   At  the  same time,  scientists also  need  mass
       quantities of the monoclonals.   Hybridoma technology  meets
       both of these needs.

       The  1970s  gave us yet another major contribution from  the
       scientific  world:   DNA probes.   Scientists developed  the
       ability to extract single,  small strands of DNA that  could
       be used to seek their complementary matching strand.

       These  DNA  probes  can locate  specific  genetic  material,
       information  that  is useful for both the detection and  the
       treatment of various diseases.


       IMPACT OF ADVANCES IN DIAGNOSTICS

       The  primary targets  of research in the  diagnostics  field
       have been genetic and infectious diseases.  Genetic diseases
       are  those  in which heredity plays either an  exclusive  or
       significant  role.   Infectious  diseases  are  spread  from
       person to person through exposure to a virus or bacterium.

       Many   Americans  suffer  from  these   conditions:    Adult
       polycystic kidney disease - 300,000 to 400,000;  Sickle-cell
       anemia  - 50,000;  Cystic  fibrosis  - 30,000;  Huntington's
       disease  - 25,000;  Duchenne muscular dystrophy - 20,000  to
       30,000;  Hemophilia  - 20,000;  Alzheimer's disease - 2 to 4
       million;  and Manic depression 1 to 2 million.   These  data
       are  reflective  of the number of lives that are touched  by
       inherited diseases.
                                        Page 2





       To  a large extent,  the discovery of the genetic basis  for
       these diseases has occurred in the last decade.   Currently,
       there  are  more than 3,000  known  genetic  diseases.   The
       development  of  biotechnology-based diagnostics will  allow
       physicians   to  identify  many  of  these  illnesses   more
       accurately and quickly.

       Meanwhile,  infectious diseases are among the most prevalent
       and dangerous threats to the health of the American  public.
       Federal officials estimate that more than 1.5 million people
       have  already  been exposed to human immunodeficiency  virus
       (HIV),  which  can  lead to the acquired  immune  deficiency
       syndrome (AIDS).  AIDS had already claimed the lives of more
       than 30,000 Americans by early 1988.

       Other  infectious diseases do not share the  headlines  with
       AIDS,  but their dangers persist.   For example, hepatitis B
       is  diagnosed  in 300,000 patients  every  year.   Influenza
       causes up to 50,000 death per year.

       Advances  in  biotechnology-based  diagnostics  will  afford
       improved  and  earlier detection of infectious  and  genetic
       diseases.   Currently,  some  diseases  are  extraordinarily
       difficult  to  diagnose  properly.    What  will  these  new
       advances mean for the patient?   Early diagnosis of diseases
       can have a significant impact in three areas:

            HIGHER  SURVIVAL  RATE.  Breast  cancer is one  of  the
       leading  causes of death in women,  and most  Americans  are
       aware  of  the  value of monthly  breast  self-examinations.
       Finding a lump in a breast before it spreads to other  parts
       of the body can save a woman's life.  The theory is the same
       for biotechnology-based diagnostics.  In fact, some of these
       diagnostics  will  be  able to identify  illnesses  (cancer,
       alcoholism   and  others)  before  the  appearance  of   any
       symptoms.   Although  early detection is not a guarantee  of
       survival  against  all diseases,  many  patients  will  live
       longer if appropriate therapy begins as soon as possible.

            IMPROVED   QUALITY  OF  LIFE  FOR  THE   PATIENT.    By
       identifying  a disease at its earliest stages,  doctors  can
       often  prescribe  treatments with the fewest  side  effects.
       For  heart  disease,  it  may  mean a  change  in  diet  and
       increased  exercise instead of surgery.   For cancer,  early
       diagnosis may mean surgical alternatives to chemotherapy are
       more feasible.

            REDUCED  HEALTH CARE COSTS.   Again,  by  diagnosing  a
       disease  at  its earliest stages,  patients can often  avoid
       surgery  and  hospitalization by undergoing  less  expensive
       treatments.    Not  only  does  this  benefit  the   patient
       afflicted  with  the disease,  but it can have an impact  on
       health care and insurance costs throughout society.

       APPLICATIONS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY-BASED DIAGNOSTICS

            MONOCLONAL    ANTIBODIES.     As   discussed   earlier,
       monoclonal antibodies are highly specific.  They are cloned,
       or duplicated,  from a single white blood cell that produces

                                        Page 3





       a specific type of antibody.   Because of their specificity,
       monoclonals can be used to diagnose infectious diseases  and
       other conditions.

       In order for a monoclonal antibody to be used in health care
       application,  it  must be linked to some sort of  substance,
       such as a drug or an imaging agent.   The monoclonal acts as
       a guided missile programmed to reach an exact location. When
       it  hits  its  target,  an imaging agent,  such  as  a  tiny
       radioactive  particle,  transmits  information back  to  the
       doctor.

       Many people are already using monoclonal technology in their
       homes to detect blood in the stool (an early warning sign of
       rectal cancer and other illnesses),  to identify the time of
       ovulation,  or  to test for pregnancy.   Diagnostic uses  of
       monoclonal  antibodies  in laboratories include testing  for
       sexually   transmitted   diseases   (syphilis,    gonorrhea,
       chlamydia), hepatitis B and cystic fibrosis.

       Monoclonals  are  also  used in  the  battle  against  AIDS.
       Current  technology allows doctors to identify the existence
       of  antibodies  produced by the body when it is  exposed  to
       HIV.   But  scientists  are trying to develop  a  monoclonal
       antibody-based  diagnostic that will confirm when a  patient
       has actually been infected with AIDS.   They are also trying
       to find a way to treat AIDS using monoclonal antibodies.

       Although  not  yet available for  widespread  use,  clinical
       testing  of monoclonal antibody-based technology  for  heart
       disease  is underway.   It is hoped these tests will  locate
       dangerous   blood   clots,   determine   the   severity   of
       atherosclerosis  (the  hardening or narrowing  of  arteries,
       which   is   the  underlying  cause  of  most  deaths   from
       cardiovascular  disease),  and  the extent of  damage  to  a
       patient's heart following a heart attack.

       Other diagnostic applications of monoclonal antibodies focus
       on   cancer.    One  currently  available  diagnostic   test
       identifies the continued presence of ovarian cancer in women
       who  have  already undergone initial treatment.   This  test
       helps   doctors   determine  the  necessity   of   follow-up
       exploratory surgery,  and assists them in deciding to  alter
       or  discontinue  therapy following this second  look.   Some
       12,000 women die from ovarian cancer each year.

       Clinical  trials are underway for  another  monoclonal-based
       diagnostic,  designed  to  help  diagnose six  cancer  types
       (lung, colorectal, breast, pancreatic, stomach and ovarian).
       Together  these cancers account for over 60 percent  of  the
       annual cancer deaths in the United States.

       In  this procedure,  a radioactive substance is linked to  a
       monoclonal  antibody  that can identify the presence of  any
       one of these six types of cancer.  The monoclonal transports
       the  radioisotope  to tumor  sites,  making  their  location
       visible through the use of an X-ray machine.



                                        Page 4





       The  test  also confirms the malignancy of the  tumors,  and
       helps physicians determine which tumors can be  successfully
       removed before surgery ever takes place.  These distinctions
       were not possible with previous diagnostic methods.

            DNA PROBES.  In the 1970s, scientists found ways to cut
       DNA  into fragments at predictable points,  using a kind  of
       chemical   scissors  called  restriction   enzymes.    After
       studying  large  groups of family members and their  genetic
       makeup,  they  identified variations in the size of the  DNA
       segments,  called  polymorphisms,  that appeared along  with
       certain diseases.

       Using this knowledge,  scientists devised DNA probes,  short
       portions  of DNA that are able to attach themselves  to  the
       polymorphism associated with a specific disease.  The probes
       are  labeled  with  a radioactive substance.   They  can  be
       easily visualized by exposure on film.

       DNA  probes  are  used  to diagnose  a  variety  of  genetic
       diseases,  including Huntington's disease, Duchenne muscular
       dystrophy,  and  cystic fibrosis.   Because they  can  often
       detect  and identify diseases and infections in a matter  of
       hours,  DNA  probe-based  tests could replace current  tests
       that take days to complete.

       Dentists  are also using DNA probes to diagnose  periodontal
       (gum) disease,  perhaps the most prevalent of all infectious
       diseases  other  than  the common cold.   According  to  the
       National Institute of Dental Research,  more than 90 million
       Americans have periodontal disease.   At least 23 million of
       them have severe cases.  Gum disease accounts for 70 percent
       of all adult tooth loss.

       Although this infection can be extremely painful,  it  often
       begins  and  progresses unnoticed.   A test using DNA  probe
       technology  can now detect the various bacteria  that  cause
       the  disease.   This  test  establishes progression  of  the
       condition,  helps dentists select appropriate  therapy,  and
       monitors treatment results.

       Another  important application of DNA probes is found in the
       food industry.  DNA probe-based diagnostic tests can rapidly
       detect disease-causing microorganisms such as Salmonella,  a
       bacterium that is a common cause of food poisoning.

       The standard culture method for the detection of  Salmonella
       in food requires a minimum of four days to identify negative
       samples.    If  the  culture  is  positive,  indicating  the
       presence  of the bacteria,  an additional two to three  days
       are required for confirmation,

       This  slow  process  causes a considerable expense  to  food
       processors,  whose  food  must remain in  quarantine  during
       these  diagnostic tests.   Rapid detection of Salmonella  in
       food  products  benefits  the  food  industry  by   reducing
       inventory  costs  and  response  time  in  the  event  of  a
       contamination problem.


                                        Page 5





       A  new DNA probe-based assay provides much quicker diagnosis
       of Salmonella contamination.  When the probe is labeled with
       an  identifiable  "tag," it can determine  the  presence  or
       absence of the bacteria.  Nearly 100 samples can be analyzed
       in  four to five hours following the growth of a culture  in
       the  laboratory.   The  test also provides  confirmation  of
       positive samples.

            GENE  MAPPING.   Human  genetics is in the midst  of  a
       revolution.   In the mid-1970s, about all that could be done
       was study inherited diseases and track their frequency.  Not
       it is possible to locate and identify those genes that cause
       hereditary   diseases.    As  scientists  learn  more  about
       defective genes,  the role they play in disease,  and  their
       locations relative to each other,  they are able to create a
       type of map.  This process is called gene mapping.

       Just  as  the  explorers  Lewis and  Clark  pieced  together
       information  into  maps  that guided  settlers  of  the  new
       American  frontier,  scientists are creating maps that  will
       help  lead  medical researchers into the 21st  century,  and
       beyond.

       Genetic  mapping  allows  for the development  of  tests  to
       diagnose  diseases.   Further study of the gene may  provide
       new directions for treatment.

       The  complete genetic code of a human being is contained  in
       50,000  to  100,000 genes comprised of  DNA.   As  discussed
       earlier,  these  genes  are  located  in  the  23  pairs  of
       chromosomes that each of us possess.

       Scientists  are  able to break the chromosomes  into  pieces
       called RFLPs,  or restriction fragment length polymorphisms.
       RFLPs are also called genetic markers because they mark  the
       location  of a defective gene.   Imagine you are looking for
       the public library, and someone tells you that it is next to
       a certain landmark,  such as city hall.  Now every time  you
       try  to find the library,  you may look for the landmark and
       know that you will find it.

       An  RFLP is like city hall,  a marker that helps  scientists
       find   the  approximate  location  of  a   defective   gene.
       Currently,  genetic  markers  are  useful for  diagnosis  in
       families in which specific inherited diseases are prevalent,
       such as cystic fibrosis.

       Scientists  have  pinpointed  the gene  that  causes  cystic
       fibrosis,   a   disease  that  affects  the  digestive   and
       respiratory  systems  so severely  that,  if  not  diagnosed
       early,  premature  death  is  often the  result.   With  the
       discovery  of the defective gene,  the fetus of a woman  who
       already has one child afflicted with cystic fibrosis can now
       be  screened  and diagnosed early in her pregnancy  with  99
       percent accuracy.

       While  there  is no known cure for  cystic  fibrosis,  early
       diagnosis  can  lead to therapy that can  improve  both  the
       quality of life and the life expectancy of the patient.

                                        Page 6





       Defective  genes have been linked to other diseases as well,
       including  Duchenne  muscular  dystrophy,  adult  polycystic
       kidney  disease,  a  familial  form Alzheimer's  disease,  a
       familial  form  of  colon  cancer,   and  a  form  of  manic
       depression found among the Pennsylvania Amish.

            USES  IN AGRICULTURE.   Have you ever noticed  a  house
       plant  that has sagging leaves?   Or maybe they have  turned
       yellow,  or  have fallen off their stems.   When it comes to
       their health,  plants are a little like people.   Infectious
       diseases  can make them sick.   The same is true  with  farm
       animals.   That's  why biotechnology-based diagnostics  will
       play an important role in agriculture.

       Some  of  the most promising aspects of new diagnostics  are
       their potential to reduce the use of certain chemicals,  and
       to better target the application of some necessary chemicals
       in  the fields.   By quickly identifying a crop  disease,  a
       farmer  can  use  a  more  specific  type  of  herbicide  or
       fungicide  in  a  smaller  dose.   This can  help  a  farmer
       increase the yield and reduce the cost of raising crops.  To
       the consumer,  it might mean lower food prices.  It can also
       mean  a cleaner environment,  including fewer  chemicals  in
       groundwater.

       Diagnostics  for  conditions  that cause rotting  in  stored
       vegetables can also prevent tremendous losses,  as can tests
       for diseases common among expensive fruit trees.

       Monoclonal  antibody-based diagnostics can  identify  fungal
       diseases  affecting  many  plants.   An example  of  a  test
       already in use involves turf grass.  It is being marketed to
       golf courses and will soon be available to home gardeners.

       The   turf   grass  diagnostic  kit  detects  three   highly
       destructive fungal diseases (pythium blight, dollar spot and
       brown patch) before visible symptoms appear.   As with early
       diagnosis  of diseases in humans,  early  identification  of
       turf grass problems means appropriate treatment can begin at
       a time when it can be the most beneficial.

       The disease can be diagnosed by using a dipstick.  A plastic
       stick is coated with the diagnostic material.   The stick is
       dipped into the soil,  and if a disease is present,  the tip
       of  the  dipstick  is turns purple.   The  severity  of  the
       disease is determined by the depth of the color.

       Monoclonals will also provide quick and definitive diagnoses
       of  animal diseases.   Now,  when an animal gets  sick,  the
       farmer  or  veterinarian often can only treat the  symptoms.
       But many diseases can produce similar symptoms, so without a
       quick  and  accurate diagnosis,  the farm animal  -- or  the
       domestic   companion  animal  -- may  not   receive   proper
       treatment.

       ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

       As  the advances in diagnostics expand our knowledge of  the
       human   genetic   code,   society  must  ensure  that   this
       information  is used properly.   The biotechnology  industry
       must be careful to protect the rights and safety of  people;
       it  does not take this responsibility lightly.   This is one
       of the roles of government regulation,  and various  federal
       agencies are working with the scientific community to ensure
       that our health and the environment are protected.

       While   biotechnology-based  diagnostics  may  confirm   the
       presence of some diseases for which there are no life saving
       treatments  at  this time,  the ability to use the tests  to
       study  these  diseases  enables scientists  to  develop  new
       approaches for prevention and cure.



       THE FUTURE OF DIAGNOSTICS

       Have  you ever wondered why some people smoke two  packs  of
       cigarettes  a day and live to be 90 years old,  while others
       develop lung cancer at the age of 45?   Or why an apparently
       healthy person dies of a heart attack at 40,  while  someone
       who  is  overweight  and has bad eating habits seems  to  be
       immune to heart disease?

       The answer may lie in their genes.   It appears some  people
       are  more likely than others to develop high blood pressure,
       heart disease,  cancer,  diabetes, arthritis, alcoholism and
       other conditions.   These people are said to have a  genetic
       predisposition to certain diseases.

       Scientists  hope  that gene mapping will lead us into a  new
       era  of diagnostics.   Much of the scientific  community  is
       concentrating its efforts on mapping the genome,  the entire
       genetic  material of humans.   The project,  which is  being
       worked on by government and private scientists,  is expected
       to  take years to complete.   It will probably cost hundreds
       of millions of dollars to pay for this research.

       Through  the mapping of defective genes and  their  markers,
       many  diseases  could  be diagnosed just a few  weeks  after
       conception.   In  some instances,  gene mapping may lead  to
       effective treatments where currently there is no cure.

       In late 1987,  several judges around the country allowed the
       results of biotechnology-based tests to be used as  evidence
       in criminal cases.   A Florida court convicted a man of rape
       and assault on the basis of a DNA test.

       Some  scientists and law enforcement officials believe  that
       DNA  probes and monoclonal antibody-based tests will be used
       more  extensively  in the  future.   The  tests,  which  can
       analyze  blood  and  other body  fluids,  may  provide  more
       accurate  identification of both suspects and  victims.   As
       the use of these tests becomes more widespread,  prosecutors
       and  defense attorneys may turn to biotechnology to  support
       their cases.

       Biotechnology-based  diagnostics that have been approved  by
       federal   regulatory  agencies  involve  in  vitro  (in  the
       laboratory)  techniques.   But  researchers  are  developing
       diagnostics that are used in vivo,  or in the body.  In vivo
       diagnostics  will  allow doctors to "see" diseases  as  they
       appear  within our bodies.   This will provide doctors  with
       greater  insight  into diseases that have confounded us  for
       centuries, leading to improved treatment for all of us.

       But  the  most  promising potential result  of  advances  in
       diagnostics  goes beyond merely treating the  diseases  that
       affect  our  lives.   The understanding that  biotechnology-
       based diagnostics will provide may help scientists find  the
       true  causes  of  these diseases and provide them  with  the
       information necessary to prevent and cure them.
