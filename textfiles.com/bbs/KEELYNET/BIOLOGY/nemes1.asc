                             First Photos of the Atom!
                                 by David Legerman

       A revolutionary  new scientific  instrument has  been invented that
       penetrates to the  heart of matter, the atom,  and photographs it in
       color!

       The incredible microscope  is   called  the Nemescope, and it is the
       culmination of  years of  research   by  Dr. Elmer  P.  Nemes, a 44-
       year-old  Hungarian-born  physician   presently  living  in  Beverly
       Hills, Calif.  Prior to the  development of the  Nemescope, the most
       powerful  magnifying instrument  known to  science was  the electron
       microscope. But this  has several drawbacks, not the  least of which
       is that it produces black-and-white  or grey shadow photos with very
       little  internal structure  shown.

       The  electron microscope  has an effective  magnification  of  about
       60,000X  which  can  be further magnified photographically. However,
       there  is no penetration of the structure of the  examined material;
       nothing can be  seen inside the surface. The Nemescope, which uses a
       ray of much shorter length than the  electron,  possibly  below even
       the neutron range,  gives  beautiful penetration and  resolution  of
       internal structure.

       The new microscope  costs a fraction of the  electron microscope and
       requires specimen preparation no more complicated than that required
       by a simple optical microscope. In addition to producing photographs
       of sub-atomic structure in color, the Nemescope can also project the
       image on a screen or reproduce it via television.

       The secret of  the Nemescope begins with the theory  that if you can
       cause radiation of any substance, it  will emit an image that can be
       converted to light,    magnified,    and   photographed   in   color
       corresponding to its spectrum characteristics. Any solid, liquid, or
       gas  could be  excited by   radioactivity in  this manner and would
       respond by emitting  at its own resonant frequency  an image in true
       color, form, and spectrum.

                                      Page 1





       Working  on this  theory, Dr.  Nemes constructed  his first model, a
       tank-like case shielded  with lead that was a  maze of knobs, wires,
       pipes, and cables. At first  all controls were hand-manipulated, but
       the  Nemescope is  now ready  for electrically  driven controls with
       motors  that have  recorded movement  intervals of 1/75,000th of an
       inch.

       A full  explanation of  how this  remarkable instrument works would
       take many pages (it includes more than 20 original patents) but here
       is a brief outline:

           1.  The   first   unit  is  a  cold  cathode  lamp with multiple
               units separately charged.   The  filaments are  preheated by
               an input of 18 volts amplified to  608 volts at the emitting
               end. This  cathode  gun  acts   as the  primary  source   of
               illumination  and bombarder of the specimen to be examined.

           2.  The   second   unit   is   a   condenser   under vacuum with
               molecular nitrogen injected.   In the condenser  circuit are
               placed  two  radium  guns each yielding 5,400,000   electron
               volts. The  condenser  includes  a  coil  which   carries by
               interchangeable switch    from  240  megacycles  to   35,000
               megacycles  in  magnitron  arrangement  which hits  the
               specimen to agitate or excite the molecular structure.

           3.  The  resulting stream of  energy is converted  into light in
               the front orthicon tube, actually consisting   of  two tubes
               which pick  up  resonant  frequencies   in the high  ranges.
               After amplification,   the  imaging    orthicon   emits    a
               picture   on   the   screen  in color corresponding  to  the
               nature of the substance under examination.

       Results  obtained  with  the  Nemescope   have  been  no less than
       astounding.  In  1955,  working  with  patients  in the hospitals of
       Mexico City,  Dr. Nemes succeeded  in making pictures  of cells from
       the  blood  and  urine  of   cancer  patients  which established a
       relationship between human cancer and a virus.

       In 1957,  enzyme battery research  started by Dr.  Nemes resulted in
       another breakthrough  when for the first  time enzymes were resolved
       under a microscope. Through the  Nemescope enzymes can be classified
       and  identified.  When  we  realize  that  enzymes  are the chemical
       catalysts of living matter and  that viruses share with bacteria the
       responsibility for most infectious  diseases, a microscope that will
       enable man to study  more closely these ultra-microscopic substances
       is indeed a boon to mankind.

       Another exciting discovery made by the  Nemescope is in the field of
       metallurgy.  Behavior of  metallic alloys  under bombardment by the
       Nemescope  has  indicated  that  the  present  makeup of widely used
       alloys must be  revised and new techniques developed  to insure more
       stable  bonding  elements.  Where  the  electron  microscope showed
       perfect molecular alignment, the Nemescope photos showed fault lines
       and distinct weaknesses among bonding elements.

       Metal failure of hull welds or pipe welds may have been the cause of
       the sinking  of the "Thresher". It's  obvious that a closer look at
       the behavior  of metals in the  atomic or molecular regions must be
       made. The Nemescope, with its great magnifying and resolving powers,

                                      Page 2





       will probably furnish the answers to these questions, as well as the
       answers  to how  materials behave  when exposed  to vacuum, ions and
       electrons, and the electromagnetic radiation known to exist in outer
       space.

       Nemescope  photos  of  the  structure  of  the  atomic nucleus are
       beautiful  in  their  resolution.  Perhaps  the  most surprising and
       exciting sight is  how the atomic particles are  connected by "force
       lines" or bands of energy.  Nemescope photos of sub-atomic structure
       have an  amazing similarity to Rutherford  models of the atom--those
       three-dimensional  models of  vari-colored balls  held together with
       pencil-thin rods. Leukemia particles and the common cold virus, when
       photographed  by the  Nemescope in  full color,  have a precision in
       structure  that  can,  perhaps,  be  appreciated  only by a research
       scientist or laboratory technician.
