                                THE ORIGIN OF AIDS

              A Startling New Theory Attempts to Answer the Question
                     'Was It An Act of God or an Act of Man?'
                                   By Tom Curtis

                   from Rolling Stone Magazine, March 19th, 1992

            It was  almost  thirty  years  ago,  but I clearly remember one
       event on that  hot  and  humid  day  early  in  August  1962.   Like
       communicants in some universal mass, my two brothers, my parents and
       I slowly moved to the head of a very long, snaking  line composed of
       thousands of people  --  a  significant  part  of  the population of
       Galveston, Texas.  All were awaiting  admittance  into  the  central
       hallway of Ball  High School so we could approach  a  simple  wooden
       table -- a kind of altar of science --where a volunteer nurse handed
       each individual a  tiny  paper cup containing a sugar cube.  I gazed
       intently at mine.  One side had a faint yellow tinge and dark specks
       where the helf-cubic-centimeter of  so  drop  of  liquid vaccine had
       landed.  Though I was surprised that my cube was so dirty looking, I
       popped it in my mouth, chewed and swallowed.  The rest of my family
       followed suit.

            Over the  next  two years, the same ritual was  played  out  in
       towns and cities  across  America.   These  other patient believers,
       like me and my family, were seeking  not  life eternal but science's
       more secular but  no less miraculous promise:  everlasting  immunity
       from the most   dreaded  scourge  of  the  Forties  and  Fifties  --
       paralytic poliomyelitis.  Before the  polio vaccines were introduced
       in the Fifties, the disease had struck about 22,000 people a year in
       the United States alone -- often young children.  The  new,  vibrant
       medium of television  showed kids like us shackled by leg braces and
       crutches or imprisoned in iron lungs  -- huge cylinders covering all
       but their heads.  I had an even more terrifying image of the ravages
       of polio:  A  close  friend of my parents, a vital  young  physician
       named Martin Schneider, had contracted the disease in 1948 and would

                                      Page 1





       spend the last two decades of his life paralyzed from the waist down
       and confined to a wheelchair.

            In one  of the greatest triumphs of twentieth-century medicine,
       the promise to deliver us from that  crippling  contagion  was kept.
       The one-two punch of the "polio shots" developed by  Dr.  Jonas Salk
       and the oral vaccine developed later by Dr. Alfred Sabin effectively
       eradicated polio in  developed  countries  and  later in much of the
       Third World.  But there was a shadow  over  the  conquest  of polio.
       It's estimated that   early   on,  at  least,  the  polio   vaccines
       administered to many  millions  of people in the U.S. and around the
       world were inadvertently contaminated.  "We took all the precautions
       we knew of at the time," Salk says  today.   "Sometimes you find out
       things after the fact."

            What Salk and the other pioneers of the polio vaccine found out
       was that accidents  did  happen.   In  the  preparation  of  massive
       amounts of various polio vaccines -- either weakened or killed virus
       that causes recipients  to  form  protective  antibodies  --  things
       occasionally went horribly  wrong.    Hundreds  of  people  actually
       contracted polio by the very means they sought to protect themselves
       -- and some died.  Researchers who cultured the virus  using tissues
       of animals were  stricken  and  sometimes  killed  by  other viruses
       infecting the animals.  And finally, the medium that scientists used
       to produce the vaccine -- the kidneys  of monkeys caught in the wild
       -- was found  to  be sometimes contaminated by simian  viruses  that
       were later passed on to millions of unsuspecting people.

            There is the prospect that we may find out something else after
       the fact:  that   another   polio  vaccine  may  have  inadvertently
       infected its recipients with an even  more  fearsome  and  insidious
       virus, the one  that causes acquired immune deficiency  syndrome  --
       AIDS.

            In August  1991,  Blaine Elswood, and articulate AIDS-treatment
       activist and diligent sleuth of medical  literature who works at the
       University of California at San Francisco, mailed  me  a  terse note
       paper-clipped to several  xeroxed  items from medical and scientific
       journals raising the issue.  "Here's  a bombshell story just waiting
       for an investigative reporter," he'd said.

            We'd had  a  casual,  two-year telephone-and-mail  acquaintance
       ever since Elswood  had been recommended to me as a source by a West
       Coast dermatology professor working  on  new  treatments  for  AIDS.
       Clearly a maverick,  Elswood  was  proudest  of  having   co-founded
       "guerilla clinics," which research and provide alternative drugs for
       those with AIDS, in San Francisco and elsewhere.  Elswood is neither
       a physician nor  a  Ph.D.,  and  he has one clear bias:  He does not
       think American doctors will easily  acknowledge that medical science
       itself may have played an unintentional role in introducing  AIDS to
       the human population.

            As I  soon  find out, Elswood is right.  When I broach the idea
       to Salk, who is once again working  to  develop a vaccine, this time
       for AIDS, he flatly refuses to discuss the subject.   "I don't think
       I can be  helpful  to  you," he says, "other than to try to dissuade
       you from pursuing that kind of hypothesis, because what value is it?
       What value is it to anyone to try  to  imply such a cause-and-effect
       relationship?"  He also makes it clear that he strongly subscribes

                                      Page 2





       to another plausible  theory:   that the AIDS virus has lingered for
       eons in African jungle tribes and  erupted  to  cause  epidemics  in
       recent decades only when those rural peoples migrated to the cities.

                                  African Genesis

            AIDS first appeared in equatorial Africa, many  scientists  now
       believe.  The earliest  evidence  of  its  presence  on  the African
       continent dates from a plasma sample  drawn in 1959 in what was then
       Leopoldville, the Belgian  Congo, and is now Kinshasa,  Zaire.   Dr.
       Mirko D. Grmek's  definitive  book  _History  of AIDS_, published in
       1990 by Princeton University Press,  describes  the  primary African
       epidemic's radiating outward  from  a region located  in  Zaire  and
       Rawanda.  There's also  a  tantalizing  connection  with monkeys and
       other primates:  Several African  species  carry  a virus related to
       the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes  AIDS  in human
       beings.  Although HIV  has  yet  to  be found in monkeys, a "missing
       link" simian virus  much  closer   to   the  human  virus  has  been
       identified in two  wild chimpanzees from Gabon.   This  has  led  to
       speculation that a chimp or a monkey with an AIDS virus identical to
       the human virus will eventually turn up.

            Scientists have proposed a grab bag of ideas to explain how the
       disease may have leapt the vast chasm from monkey to man.  There is,
       for instance, the  kinky-African-sex  theory.  It involves a bizarre
       sexual practice in  which,  to heighten  sexual  arousal,  male  and
       female members of tribes bordering the large lakes of Central Africa
       introduce monkey blood into their public regions, thighs  and backs.
       Then there's the  cut-hunter theory, recently described to me by the
       premier American AIDS researcher,  Dr. Robert Gallo.  Gallo suggests
       that since monkeys  in Africa are killed for food,  a  hunter  might
       have nicked himself while skinning an infected monkey and thus might
       have mixed virus-laden  monkey  blood  with  his  own; repeated such
       incidents over time, he argues, could have infected enough people to
       spark an epidemic.  Last Thanksgiving,  an  Oxford clinician writing
       in the prestigious  British  scientific magazine _Nature_  presented
       another startling hypothesis:  that the disease may have sprung from
       scientific experiments that   lasted   into  the  Fifties  in  which
       chimpanzee and monkey blood was directly  injected into human beings
       to see if people could carry the form of the malaria  parasite  that
       infests those primates.

            There are  problems  with  each  theory,   The first couple are
       basically speculations that can't  easily  be  confirmed  or  tested
       scientifically.  Anyhow, those African sexual and hunting  practices
       presumably have been  going  on  for  thousands  of  years; the AIDS
       epidemic is new.   The idea involving  the  malaria  experiments  is
       extremely provocative.  It  may  prove  to  be  more  than  that  if
       material from the  original  experiments  still  exists  and  can be
       scientifically checked.  But the  number  of  people involved in the
       tests was tiny:  As discussed in _Nature_, a total  of about seventy
       people received primate  blood or primate-tainted human blood during
       the entire range of the malaria experiments,  which ran from 1922 to
       1955.  Still, AIDS  had  to  start  somewhere,  so  like  the  other
       theories, this one has to be considered.

            Sprinkled through  the  medical  literature of the last thirty-
       five years are facts that buttress  the unnerving prospect that HIV,
       the AIDS virus,  may  have  crossed  the  species   barrier   as  an
       unintended byproduct of  a  live-polio-virus vaccine.  There was, in
       fact, an almost forgotten mass-vaccination campaign in which an oral
       polio vaccine was  administered to  at  least  325,000  people,  and
       perhaps more than half a million people, in equatorial  Africa  from
       1957 to 1960.   One  of  the  two vaccines used in that experimental
       effort was subsequently reported to  have  been contaminated with an
       unknown monkey virus.

            The timing  seems right.  A process called genetic  sequencing,
       which tracks the  evolution of a virus by measuring genetic changes,
       can read the molecular history of  a  disease.   According to Gerald
       Myers, the federal government's chief expert in genetic  sequencing,
       HIV dates from  about  1960, assuming it arose from a single, common
       ancestor.

            There are natural obstacles  preventing  a  virus from crossing
       the barrier to become established and thrive in a new  species.  But
       it happens.  And  when  it  does,  the virus frequently becomes much
       deadlier in the new species than it was in the original species.

            In recent decades, some scientists believe, live-virus vaccines
       may have actually  helped transfer  viruses  across  species  lines.
       Perhaps the classic  example  is  canine parovirus,  or  CPV,  which
       abruptly appeared in  dogs  in  1977  and within months had become a
       widespread animal epidemic -- or  epizootic  --  on  virtually every
       continent, causing entirely new dog diseases of the  intestines  and
       heart muscle.  CPV  is intriguingly similar in its genetic structure
       to a cat disease called feline panleukopenia  virus (FPLV), but it's
       even more similar to to the vaccine for this disease.  This has lead
       several virologists to suggest that by accident or  design,  the cat
       virus most likely was introduced into dog cells in the laboratory,
       where the strain adapted itself to the new host.

            A 1989  article  in  the  _Journal  of  the  Royal  Society  of
       Medicine_ noted that  case  and  a  number  of  other  cross-species
       transfers of viruses in the context of AIDS.  "It would appear," the
       piece said, "that the AIDS epidemic may be just one of the latest of
       several mammalian cross-species  viral  transfers triggered  by  the
       techniques of virology   developed   in   the  20th  Century,  which
       subsequently spread out of control in the new host species."

            To grasp how this possibility  relates  to a polio vaccine used
       in Africa, it helps to know how polio came to be suppressed  in most
       of the world.

                         "It's Not Good to Know Too Much"

            Jonas Salk, backed by a private philanthropy popularly known as
       the March of  Dimes,  introduced the first widely used polio vaccine
       in 1954.  His vaccine was a virulent  form  of  the polio virus that
       had been killed by formaldehyde.  This dead, or "inactivated," virus
       was injected into  people  to  provoke the body's immune  system  to
       manufacture disease-fighting antibodies  that  would repel the wild,
       paralyzing types of polio.  But medical  science ultimately rejected
       Salk's shots in   favor   of  a  weakened  but  still-living   virus
       administered by mouth -- Albert Sabin's sugar cube.  Unlike the Salk

                                      Page 4





       shots, which were believed to require periodic booster vaccinations,
       the oral vaccine  conferred lifetime immunity.  It could be taken by
       mouth and required no injections; and the live vaccine silently
       spread the weakened, non-paralyzing  virus  even to those who failed
       to take the oral vaccine.  These "susceptibles"  would  simply catch
       the weakened virus   and   get   the  infection  without  noticeable
       symptoms.  They also would become immune to paralytic polio.

            Polio vaccines are produced  by  selecting  weakened strains of
       polio virus and then placing them in tissue cultures  --  live cells
       from primates.  (Either   monkey  or  human  cells  will  work,  but
       researchers selected monkeys because  their tisue was more available
       and there were fears that human cell lines might spread cancer.  The
       unrecognized danger, though,   was   this:   Because   monkeys   are
       genetically similar to  human  beings,  some simian viruses can leap
       the species barrier with devastating effect.)  The virus then enters
       the cell and reproduces itself.   All  the  polio  viruses  grown to
       produce the mass vaccines in the Fifties were fed one particularly
       nourishing medium:  fresh  monkey  kidneys.   And   throughout   the
       Fifties -- a  period  that  was barely beyond the dawn of scientific
       knowledge regarding tissue culture  --  some of those monkey kidneys
       were infected with numerous monkey viruses.  Scientists  knew  about
       some of these  viruses  and  developed  tests  to  identify and then
       eliminate the tissues that contained them.

            One of the earliest and deadliest  was  the  so-called monkey B
       virus -- a  herpes virus first identified and isolated  in  1932  by
       Sabin after it  killed  a  medical  colleague at New York's Bellevue
       Hospital.  The unfortunate polio  researcher  had  been  bitten by a
       monkey.  "He had developed paralysis after the monkey  bite,"  Sabin
       recalls almost sixty years later as I interview him in the office of
       his Washington, D.C.,  apartment.   "He  died  after  a short time."
       Sabin, who with his full white beard  and  hair looks like Robert E.
       Lee, continues:  "At the autopsy I collected specimens  and isolated
       a virus.  Because  I  was  too  green  behind my ears in virology, I
       would not accept [it] as being an  ordinary  herpes virus with which
       human beings are   infected  --  which  a  professor   at   Columbia
       University, who knew  much  more  than  I,  did."   Chuckling at the
       memory, he adds, "Sometimes it's not good to know _too_ much."

            While working at the Lister  Institute,  in  England,  in 1934,
       Sabin was able  to  prove that what he found was a  distinct  virus.
       And in 1949,  when  he  was  working  in  Cincinnati, Ohio, he again
       isolated the virus after another physician  researcher was killed by
       it.  "Then, as  thousands  of  monkeys  began  to be  used  for  the
       preparation of the  Salk  vaccine in the early Fifties," Sabin says,
       ten or so caretakers working with  the  monkey  kidneys  or who were
       bitten while handling the monkeys also developed  the  same  illness
       and died.

           "In monkeys, it's a disease which is as mild as ordinary fever
       blisters are in   human  beings,"  Sabin  says,  but  in  humans  it
       paralyzes and kills.   "As a result  of  that,  all  the  [research]
       monkeys had to  be  tested."  Special  precautions were  instituted.
       "But often precautions  were  not  used,"  Sabin  says.  Deaths from
       monkey B virus, though infrequent,  have  continued,  the  latest  a
       veterinarian at a south Texas primate facility who  died of monkey B
       virus last fall.

                             The Fortieth Monkey Virus

            So monkey  B  was kept out of the polio vaccines.  But thee was
       another monkey virus that polio researchers  missed.   Between  1954
       and 1963, an  estimated  10 to 30 million Americans  and  scores  of
       millions of people  around  the  world  were exposed to a virus that
       infected the kidneys of Asian rhesus  monkeys  imported  mainly from
       India.  The virus survived the formaldehyde that Salk  used  to kill
       his polio viruses.   Since  1961 researchers have tested monkeys for
       SV40 -- so called because it was  the  fortieth  such  simian  virus
       identified -- before using their kidneys for vaccine production.

            SV40 was  delivered  straight into people's bloodstreams  along
       with their Salk  shots  and  via  sugar cubes in field trials of the
       weakened living virus developed by Sabin.  Though it was later shown
       to cause cancer in hamsters and to "immortalize" human cells in test
       tubes -- thus predisposing these  cells  to  cancer  -- SV40 has not
       been proven to  generate  illness  in  human beings.   Nevertheless,
       researchers at Johns  Hopkins  recently  discovered  that  when they
       injected cells treated with SV40  into  "nude"  mice,  which lack an
       immune system, the  mice  developed  Kaposi's  Sarcoma-like  tumors,
       similar to those   afflicting   many   AIDS   victims.   Remarkably,
       considering the large  numbers of  people  who  received  the  SV40-
       contaminated polio vaccines,   no   one  ever  conducted   a   major
       epidemiological study in  the  U.S. to discover whether there is any
       pattern of illnesses caused by the virus.

            Still, there are some troubling  statistical  associations.  In
       1968 a scientist in Australia described a correlation  between polio
       immunization and cancers  in  children  past  one year of age.  Much
       later, German scientists found evidence  of  SV40  in  30 out of 110
       brain tumors, and later reports indicated a jump in the frequency of
       brain tumors among those who had received vaccine contaminated  with
       SV40.  And SV40  has  been  associated  with  other human cancers as
       well.

            After news broke about the monkey virus SV40 contaminating some
       lots of Salk's and Sabin's polio  vaccines,  congressional  hearings
       were called to examine the explosive issue.  On April  14th, 1961, a
       rival polio researcher  of  Salk's  and Sabin's sent a letter to the
       House Health and Saftey Subcommittee taking issue with growing live-
       polio-virus vaccine in monkey kidneys.

            Sounding like someone who had come to his understanding through
       hard experience, the  researcher   --   Dr.   Hilary   Koprowski  of
       Philadelphia's Wistar Institute  -- suggested that  human  cells  be
       used instead.  "As  monkey  kidney  culture  is  host to innumerable
       simian viruses, the number found varying  in  relation to the amount
       of work expended  to  find  them,  the  problem  presented   to  the
       manufacturer is considerable, if not insuperable," Koprowski wrote
       to the committee.   "As  our  technical  methods improve we may find
       fewer and fewer lots of vaccine which can be called free from simian
       virus."

            But when Koprowski, Salk and  Sabin  were  doing  their initial
       vaccine development in  the  Fifties,  little  was known  about  the
       simian viruses, and  there  were  no federal regulations stipulating
       that the viruses be grown in a specific  type of tissue culture.  No
       one knew then about retroviruses like HIV that might take years to

                                      Page 6





       develop, and so  it  was  assumed that if no viruses had shown up in
       preparations after a  couple  of weeks,  then  those  vaccines  were
       clean.

            In 1988, when researchers in Washington, D.C.,  area reexamined
       an earlier study run between 1959 and 1965 on nearly 59,000 pregnant
       women, they found  a  startling  connection:  The incidence of brain
       tumors in children of mothers who'd  been  injected  with  the  Salk
       vaccine was thirteen times greater than that of offspring of mothers
       who hadn't had  those  polio shots.  Stored blood serum  from  those
       mothers still existed,  and  it  was  retested.  The tests seemed to
       exclude SV40 as the cause.  But if  not  SV40,  what  about the Salk
       vaccine might explain  the  increased  risk  of  brain   tumors   in
       offspring of vaccinated  women?   The researchers asserted that some
       other infection was probably the  culprit.   After  all, they noted,
       the Salk vaccine  was  known  to  have been contaminated  _numerous_
       monkey viruses.

                             The Marburg Monkey Virus

            In mid-August  1967,  six  years after the SV40 problem came to
       light, a mysterious,  dangerous,   infectious   disease   broke  out
       simultaneously in German   and   Yugoslavian  research   institutes.
       Thirty-one people, including  the technicians making polio vaccines,
       suddenly became ill  -- and seven  died.   All  those  infected  had
       direct contact with  monkeys  or  their  blood,  organs   or  tissue
       cultures.  Other people   later  got  the  disease,  too,  including
       hospital personnel who had contact  with  these  patients.   In  one
       case, a woman contracted the disease from the semen  of her husband,
       who had been  infected  three  months  earlier.   Though millions of
       monkeys had been used as experimental animals and as raw material to
       provide kidneys to make vaccines, no such disease had ever been seen
       before.  Eventually the "Marburg Virus" was isolated, and its source
       was traced to monkeys shipped from Uganda.

            But if HIV were one of those numerous anonymous monkey viruses
       contaminating the early Salk and  Sabin  vaccines,  presumably there
       would have been  an  explosion of AIDS in the U.S.  outside  of  the
       currently defined high-risk  groups:  male homosexuals, intravenous-
       drug users, hemopheliacs and the  sexual  partners  of those people.
       Of course, that sort of eruption hasn't happened in the U.S.  But it
       did happen someplace else:  in equatorial Africa.

                                 The Congo Vaccine

            As it happens, equatorial Africa was the site  of  the  world's
       first mass trials  of an oral polio vaccine -- a vaccine cultured in
       monkey kidneys but different in at  least one important respect from
       the Sabin vaccine ultimately adopted worldwide.   This  footnote  in
       medical history took  place from 1957 to 1960 right in the middle of
       what was then the Belgian Congo, Rwanda and Burundi -- the epicenter
       of the future  African  AIDS  epidemic.    It  was  developed  by  a
       naturalized American polio researcher named Hilary  Koprowski -- the
       same Dr. Koprowski  who  four  years later would warn congressmen of
       the dangers of  an  almost  infinite   number   of   monkey  viruses
       contaminating polio vaccines.

            Hilary Koprowski,  the developer of the vaccines  used  in  the
       Congo, is a charming, deep-voiced man of seventy-five.  Born and

                                      Page 7





       educated in Poland,  where  he studied to be a concert pianist while
       going to medical   school,  Koprowski   began   work   for   Lederle
       Laboratories in 1946.  Like Salk and Sabin he took  up  the cause of
       saving the world  from  polio.   He  tested  weakened strains of the
       virus in monkeys and chimps and in March 1951 surprised a meeting of
       polio researchers sponsored  by  the  March  of  Dimes  in  Hershey,
       Pennsylvania.  There he  revealed  that  he  had  become  the  first
       physician in history  to  administer a polio vaccine to humans.  The
       "volunteer" research subjects for  Koprowski's  live, weakened polio
       vaccine included twenty  children  he later described  as  "mentally
       deficient" who lived  in  Letchworth Village, a facility operated by
       the New York State Department of Mental Health.  Later he vaccinated
       other groups of  children,  among   them   the   newborn  babies  of
       institutionalized women in  New Jersey.  But a larger  test  of  the
       vaccine, planned for children of Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 1956,
       was scrapped amid  reports  that  some of his tamed oral vaccine had
       reverted to its wild, paralytic form.   While  no  one was paralyzed
       and Koprowski insists that one one ever would have been, authorities
       in Belfast feared that such a "reversion to neurovirulence,"  to use
       the medical jargon, might spark a new polio epidemic.

           *             *              *              *              *

            After the  Belfast debacle, Koprowski, who was racing Sabin for
       the distinction of producing the oral  polio vaccine of choice, left
       Lederle Laboratories to direct Philadelphia's Wistar Institute, then
       a modest research  organization best known for developing  a  unique
       laboratory rat.  But  he  held  tightly to his goal of producing the
       winning polio vaccine.

            Almost immediately, Koprowski  arranged  to  have  his weakened
       polio viruses tested in a colony of 150 chimpanzees in Camp Lindi at
       Stanleyville, in the Belgian Congo (now Kisangu, Zaire).  To protect
       the animals' caretakers, these humans, too, were  fed  the  weakened
       virus.  The successful  immunization  of the keepers then became the
       justification for the mass vaccination trials in the Congo itself --
       the first mass trials in the history of an oral polio vaccine.

            Called by drums, rural Africans  traveled  to  village assembly
       points.  There they lined up and had a liquid vaccine  squirted into
       their mouths.  Using  this  spray  method,  nearly a quarter million
       Africans were innoculated in six weeks.   Later another 75,000 or so
       children in Leopoldville,  now  Kinshasa, got the  vaccine,  too  --
       though European children  living  there  apparently  received  their
       vaccine in capsure form, possibly a significant variation.

            From the  beginning,  Koprowski's   campaign   was   marked  by
       controversy.  _Trial by  Fury_, Aaron Klein's 1972  account  of  the
       development of the polio vaccines, reports that Koprowski apparently
       claimed he had the backing of the World Health Organization, but the
       WHO denied sanctioning   the   claim.   Koprowski  says  today  that
       although he was challenged by WHO,  he  needed  only the approval of
       the Belgian authorities -- and there's no doubt he  had that.  Other
       preparations of Koprowski's   polio  vaccines  were  later  used  in
       Poland, Yugoslavia and Switzerland, among other places.

            Herald Cox, Koprowski's superior  at Lederle, had begun growing
       the polio virus in developing embryos in chicken  eggs.   Early  on,
       Koprowski also used the brains of cotton rats to select his weakened

                                      Page 8





       strains and nurture  the  virus.   But by 1956 and 1957, when he was
       readying his vaccine for use in the  Congo, Koprowski had long since
       switched to minced-up monkey kidneys.

            Monkey kidneys  contained  innumerable monkey  viruses.   Might
       the one that  causes  AIDS  be  one  of them?  And if it were, would
       Koprowski's method of  delivery --  shooting  liquid  into  people's
       mouths -- be  capable  of  transferring  the virus from  monkeys  to
       humans?

            "You can't  hang  Koprowski  with that," Albert Sabin growls at
       me.  He's sitting at the desk in  his  study;  the walls are covered
       with testimonial plaques,    certificates   of   commendation    and
       achievement, photos of  him  with several presidents.  Sabin insists
       that the AIDS virus won't survive swallowing.  He's certain of it.

            But whether it does or doesn't  survive is really not so clear-
       cut, Dr.  Robert Gallo and other retrovirus researchers acknowledged
       to me; no  one  knows  for sure.  Moreover, Gallo's  colleague,  Dr.
       William Haseltine of  Harvard  and  also  of  the Dana-Farber Cancer
       Institute, in Boston, and others have  reported  that the AIDS virus
       infects mucous cells -- which of course occur in the  mouth  as well
       as the genetalia.

            And Dr.  Robert  Bohannon  of  Baylor  College  of Medicine, in
       Houston -- who in November 1991 reported finding a monkey retrovirus
       in the tumor of an AIDS patient with no known contact with monkeys -
       - pointed out to me that the process  of squirting the polio vaccine
       in people's mouths would tend to send tiny drops into  the  air.  It
       might go directly to the lungs or nose and thence to the blood cells
       it is known to infect.

            Later I  pose the same question -- Could squirting an HIV-laden
       polio vaccine into people's minds  cause  AIDS? -- to Dr. Tom Folks,
       the chief retrovirologist  at  the  Centers for Disease  Control  in
       Atlanta.  "Sure it could," he says.  "Any time a person has a lesion
       in his mouth, then there could be transmission if you put enough" of
       the virus in.

                                    Monkey AIDS

            But was  there  anything  to  transmit?   The  answer  to  that
       question hinges on  the kind of monkeys  used  to  make  Koprowski's
       vaccine.

            In 1957,  when  the  Congo trials began, most researchers  were
       using rhesus macaques  from  India.   It would be another four years
       before scientists fully appreciated  the  danger  that macaques, the
       natural hosts for  SV40,  were  passing along the virus  to  humans.
       Once that troubling  discovery  was made, in 1961, vaccine producers
       shifted to kidneys from African green  monkeys,  which  in  the wild
       were free of SV40.

            Unfortunately, green monkeys were infected with something else.
       More than two decades later, in 1982 and 1983, veterinarians  at the
       California Primate Research  Center  and  at  Harvard's  New England
       Primate Center observed that large  numbers  of  their macaques were
       dying periodically of AIDS-like illnesses.  These disorders had been
       killing animals since 1969, but suddenly, the researchers were

                                      Page 9





       struck by the  similarity  to  the  new  disease afflicting American
       homosexual men.  The monkeys' illnesses, the researchers discovered,
       were triggered by a previously unrecognized retrovirus called simian
       immunodeficiency virus (SIV).

            Among the natural hosts for  this  virus  were  none other than
       African green monkeys,  but in that species, typically,  SIV  didn't
       cause serious disease.   SIV turned out to be related to HIV, though
       it was only about forty percent similar  in genetic structure to the
       chief AIDS-causing human retrovirus, known as HIV-1.   Robert  Gallo
       says some versions    of    this    monkey   virus   are   virtually
       indistinguishable from some human  variants  of  HIV-2,  the  second
       virus that causes  AIDS in human beings and mainly afflicts  western
       Africa.

            No one  who  was involved with Koprowski's Congo project and is
       alive today remembers what kind of monkey kidneys were used in 1957-
       60.  Koprowski is  still  vigorous   and   remains   at  the  Wistar
       Institute, in Philadelphia  --  now  as an institute  professor  and
       until 1991 as  the  director  of  the facility, which is housed in a
       stolid Victorian structure  on  the  campus  of  the  University  of
       Pennsylvania.

            Koprowski insists that his associates used kidneys from African
       green monkeys to  make the Congo vaccines.  When I express  surprise
       and mention that  Salk  and  Sabin were using rhesus monkeys at that
       point, he agrees to check.  When we  speak  next, he admits he can't
       find a single paper describing which species was  used  to  make his
       vaccine.  "But I  have a suspicion the virus was grown in the rhesus
       monkey at the original beginning,"  he  tells me in his thick Polish
       accent.  "Now when we switched to green monkeys,  I  have  no idea."
       Thomas Norton, his  associate who grew the virus for the vaccine, is
       now dead, Koprowski says -- as are  those  who worked with Norton to
       prepare the vaccine.  Significantly, the large lots  of  the vaccine
       used in the  Congo  apparently  were prepared at the laboratories of
       the Wistar Institute, he says.  Wyeth  Laboratories  made subsequent
       preparations, including those used in Poland.

                                   Contamination

            The question  of  which  monkeys were used to  make  the  Congo
       vaccine may not  be  crucial.   The  virus  that  causes monkey AIDS
       occurs in several species, though  the  original  hosts  --  African
       greens and others  --remain  healthy  even  when infected.   Monkeys
       frequently were gang-caged in those days, facilitating the spread of
       the viruses.  If  a  green  monkey  turned out to have a virus quite
       similar to HIV-1, it could have infected the other monkeys.

            Although most American researchers  in  this  period apparently
       did use rhesus  macaque  monkeys from Asia, for a while  around  the
       time Koprowski was  working  with his vaccine, the monkey supply was
       interrupted.  The Indian government  --  responding to popular alarm
       among its people about the widespread slaughter of  Indian  macaques
       for vaccine production and other research -- barred export of rhesus
       monkeys to the  U.S.   For  a time at least, that ban must have made
       suppliers scramble to find different  markets  and  alternate monkey
       species, probably including  African  monkeys.  Moreover,  Koprowski
       says the kidneys  used  at  Wistar  were bought already removed from
       their hosts, meaning that researchers might not have been sure what

                                      Page 10





       kind of monkeys  they  came  from,  much less what viruses came with
       them.

            According to no less an authority than Albert Sabin himself, at
       least one other virus did contaminate  Koprowski's  vaccine  used in
       the Congo.  In 1959, Sabin reported in the _British Medical Journal_
       that a special  test  he  had devised revealed the  presence  of  an
       "unidentified" cell-killing virus  in  "Koprowski's  Type  1  'Chat'
       vaccine used in the Belgian Congo  trials."  More than three decades
       later, Sabin says he never figured out exactly what the virus was.

            Koprowski insists  --  as he did at the time  in  the  _British
       Medical Journal_ --  that  two  other  labs examined his vaccine and
       found nothing except the weakened  polio  virus.   But  one  eminent
       polio researcher, Dr.   Joseph  Melnick,  former   chairman  of  the
       Department of Virology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who
       himself developed an  oral  polio  vaccine  while  working  at  Yale
       Medical School, says Sabin probably  was  right.   "Sabin was a very
       careful worker in  the laboratory," says Melnick,  a  tall,  formal,
       distinguished-looking man.  "And  I  have  not known him ever to say
       that he has found a virus in some  preparation that did not exist in
       that preparation."

            In any even, Melnick says, "Monkeys have a very high prevalence
       of lentiviruses," one of the subfamilies of retroviruses.   "You can
       isolate it from  their  tissues,  particularly  from  their kidneys.
       That is one reason why we stopped  using  monkeys  from the wild and
       just used home-grown monkeys."  Melnick pauses.  "It's of interest,"
       he says, "that HIV is a lentivirus."  So are simian immunodeficiency
       virus and the  so-called  foamy virus, both of which  widely  infect
       monkeys, Melnick says.   "In  the  early  days  of  the vaccines, we
       didn't know much  about  monkey   viruses."    As   for  Koprowski's
       contention that others looked and didn't find the virus in his Congo
       vaccine that Sabin had noted, Melnick has a simple explanation, "It
       may not be in one batch and may be in another batch."

                                A Tale of Two Maps

            Writing in the _British Medical Journal_ on  July  26th,  1958,
       Koprowski and his  colleagues  offered a preliminary report on their
       mass vaccination campaign.  They  included  in  the paper a detailed
       map showing where  nearly a quarter million inoculations  had  taken
       place in the  northeastern  part  of  the  Belgian  Congo.  The area
       outlined corresponds roughly to another  map  in  a report published
       thirty years later in the _Reviews of Infectious Diseases_  --  this
       one identifying the  regions  of highest HIV infection in equatorial
       Africa.

            Still another  paper  that appeared  in  the  _British  Medical
       Journal_ in 1985  reviewed  HIV  infection in the Kivu  District,  a
       remote, rural population   in   eastern   Zaire.    There,  somewhat
       puzzlingly, the researchers  discovered   "a   high   prevalence  of
       antibodies" to the AIDS virus without symptoms of the  disease.  The
       Kivu District happens  to be where Koprowski's colleagues vaccinated
       the lion's share of their reported  sample  --215,504  children  and
       adults.  And there  may  have  been  many  more  vaccinations   than
       initially reported.  "Could  have  been 200,000 more, I really don't
       know," Koprowski says,  because  the  subsequent  mass  trials  were
       interrupted by tribal chaos and the civil war the followed

                                      Page 11





       independence.  No one  really knows how those individuals fared over
       time.  No long-term follow-up was possible, Koprowski says.

            The researchers who studied the  Kivu  District in 1985 offered
       several possible explanations  for why the people  they  found  with
       antibodies for the  AIDS virus might not have the disease.  The fact
       that there were more children than  adults  with  antibodies  to the
       virus suggested that   the  adults  could  have  been   exposed   in
       childhood, and some  of  them  might  have died or departed from the
       area.  Perhaps, the researchers  ventured,  if  members  of  a rural
       population that was biologically adapted to the virus moved into an
       urban area, exposing a pool of more susceptible adults,  this  would
       create "new opportunities  for  the  virus to cause illness in urban
       adults and the  epidemic  appearance  of  the  disease  in  Africa."
       Moreover, the researchers pointed out that they were  looking  at  a
       region of "high mortality in childhood, particularly from infectious
       diseases."  Cases of  AIDS in children a generation ago simply might
       have gone unrecognized.

            Of course, many of the viruses contaminating the monkey kidneys
       went unrecognized in the Fifties and  early  Sixties.  Koprowski and
       his colleagues in  the  mass-vaccine  campaigns  found  some  monkey
       viruses and eliminated  them  from  their  preparations.   But  many
       others weren't known, and no test  to  identify  their  presence had
       been developed.  "That's the problem," Koprowski says.  "The viruses
       which you know,  there's a test -- there's no problem;  the  viruses
       which lurk, for  which  there  is  no  test,  obviously you can't do
       anything about."

            So, might Koprowski's Congo vaccine  have  been the vector that
       unwittingly first unleashed the AIDS virus among people in Africa? I
       ask the question and Koprowski dismisses the idea with a deep laugh:
       "Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho."

            I'm asking  the  question, I say.  He laughs again,  this  time
       longer and deeper.    "By   then   you  would  have  had  plenty  of
       opportunity to see AIDS in the vaccine,"  Koprowski says.  "You have
       started in 1960; now it's thirty years.  The latency  period of AIDS
       is nine years."

            But according  to Dr. Gallo, I point out, some retroviruses may
       take up to forty years to express themselves.

            "There is no indication from  any  part  of  the world that any
       other virus occurring  there [in the various polio vaccines]  causes
       any problem," Koprowski says.

            There are  reasons,  however,  why  AIDS  in the former Belgian
       Congo may have been invisible to medical  science.  In remote, rural
       eastern Zaire, where  most of Koprowski's vaccine was  administered,
       or even in Kinshasa, the disease simply may have passed unnoticed or
       may not have been identified.  "In the tropics, the wealth of lethal
       infectious pathology is   matched   by  the  poverty  of  diagnostic
       facilities, rendering undetectable  sporadic  appearances  of AIDS,"
       notes Dr. Mirko D. Grmek, a medical historian, in  his  recent  book
       _History of AIDS_.   "It is entirely possible that localized or even
       moderately large epidemics have passed unnoticed."

            On the other hand, AIDS may have been slow to express itself

                                      Page 12





       when it was  confined  to  rural areas where people had fewer sexual
       partners.  A laboratory experiment with monkeys also showed how AIDS
       may have taken a bit longer to emerge  as an epidemic in its present
       nasty form.  When  a  researcher  took a simian AIDS  virus  from  a
       healthy mangabey, a  monkey  species in which it typically causes no
       symptoms, and injected it into a  group  of  macaques,  the  disease
       became progressively more virulent each time it passed  through  the
       body of another macaque.  Finally, this isolated virus even sickened
       a mangabey, although  that  species  has  natural  resistance to the
       original virus.  A similar process  may  have  made  African AIDS in
       humans increasingly deadly  over  time:   It's easy  to  envision  a
       progression in which  an  original carrier infected by, let's say, a
       Congo vaccine would have to infect several others before the disease
       became virulent.  Such a process would  take  time and might explain
       the lull before the African epidemic appeared (just  about  the same
       time the epidemic  surfaced  in  the  United  States  and in western
       Europe).

                               The Zaire Connection

            In 1987, Belgian researchers writing for a Scandinavian medical
       journal identified seven AIDS cases  originating  in  Zaire  and  in
       nearby Burundi between  1962  and  1976 -- well before  the  African
       epidemic exploded.  Three  of  these were retrospectively identified
       as AIDS; the other four were cases  in which patients had antibodies
       for the AIDS virus.  Taken together, the authors said,  the evidence
       indicated "that AIDS  had already occurred in Central Africa several
       years prior to its emergence in the United States."

            There is yet another curious Zaire connection:  its relation to
       the secondary AIDS hot spot, Haiti.   No  one knows for sure whether
       AIDS migrated from Africa to Haiti or from the U.S.  to  Haiti.  But
       according to Grmek, in the early Sixties, after independence came to
       the former Belgian  Congo, many Haitians worked in Zaire, especially
       in Kinshasa.  The Haitians -- who  were  French  speaking, black and
       had no ties  to  Belgium -- filled the void previously  occupied  by
       Belgian colonialists.  Their  arrival, of course, came only a couple
       of years after Koprowski's vaccine  had  been tested in Kinshasa and
       in remote eastern Zaire.

            As for  the  idea  that the Congo vaccine started  the  African
       epidemic, Koprowski is  skeptical.   "Why  do you choose Africa?" he
       asks.  "Why don't you compare the enormous number of other countries
       where exactly the same [vaccine] material  was  used?  Why didn't it
       start an HIV epidemic there?"

            This answer  seems  to beg the question.  Specific  lots  of  a
       particular vaccine --  not  all  polio  vaccines everywhere -- might
       have unintentionally spawned AIDS.   For  instance, specific batches
       of Salk's killed-poliovirus vaccine prepared by Cutter  Laboratories
       turned out to  be  insufficiently  inactivated  by formaldehyde, and
       those batches paralyzed 150 of the  people  who  received  them  and
       killed 11.  Later, specific lots of Salk's and Sabin's vaccines were
       found to have been contaminated by the monkey virus  SV40,  with as-
       yet undetermined long-term   consequences  in  people.   Why  is  it
       unreasonable to ask  whether  a   specific   batch   of  Koprowski's
       preparation -- say, the unique lots prepared at the Wistar Institute
       solely for use in the Congo mass trials -- likewise might have been


                                      Page 13





       made from monkey kidneys unknowingly contaminated, in this case by a
       retrovirus that causes AIDS?

            "You're beating  a dead horse," Koprowski says.  "My opinion is
       that this is a highly theoretical situation, which ... does not make
       sense."

                                Testing Seed Stock?

            Koprowski told me that he maintains  the seed stocks -- samples
       of the original vaccines -- from the Congo mass trials  in  freezers
       at the Wistar  Institute.  I venture that it would be easy enough to
       answer the question just by testing those stocks.

            "Yes," Koprowski begins uncertainly.   "But I don't really know
       how much HIV is really present in monkey kidney ....  I  have  great
       doubt it would find its way to epithelial cells such as kidney.  You
       are postulating that  in  the highly processed monkey kidney, you'll
       get these viruses.  I doubt that they are present there."

            Later, Koprowski describes  for  me  how  the  kidneys  used in
       tissue culture were  minced  up  using "scissors or  something  like
       that."  He is  quite  correct  that  HIV and its monkey counterpart,
       SIV, do not appear to grown in kidney  cells.  Instead, as he points
       out, these viruses are known to grow in lymphocytes  and macrophages
       -- cell froms  found in the blood.  But this doesn't mean that under
       the right conditions a polio vaccine grown in monkey kidney cultures
       might not harbor an AIDS virus.

            I raise this issue with Tom  Folks,  chief  of  the  retrovirus
       laboratory at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.  "You see,
       the problem with the kidney," says Folks, is that "there's blood and
       there are lymphocytes that would be contaminating the  tissue.   So,
       no matter how  hard  you  try to mince it up -- and I've made monkey
       kidney tissue cultures many a time  --  you  haven't  gotten  rid of
       contaminating lymphocytes.  So, if the monkey that it's derived from
       has a pretty  fulminant  SIV infection, and then they  were  placing
       polio [virus] on   top   of   the  monkey  kidney,  but  there  were
       contaminated lymphocytes, that is  going  to  be  part of the stock.
       Yeah, it would be there.

            "That wouldn't  be surprising at all," Folks  continues.   "And
       the fact that  it's  a live vaccine would indicate that they had not
       gone through any inactivation procedures to denature the AIDS virus,
       because it would probably denature  the  polio virus.  So, the polio
       virus is kept alive, and the SIV virus would just  travel  with  it.
       The theory, the possibility is real.  And I don't think anyone would
       deny it."

            The ultimate  way  to  test the idea, Folks agrees, would be to
       return to the  original seed stocks  of  the  vaccine  and  actually
       isolate the retrovirus, if any, from the polio vaccine.

            Does Folks think there is value in figuring out where AIDS came
       from?  "I think any time we can learn more about natural history, it
       helps us understand  the  pathogenesis  [how  the   disease  process
       works], and it  helps us understand the transmission."  Nonetheless,
       he says:  "It's a delicate issue.   You're  going to put some people
       on the spot -- the person who has the stocks."

                                      Page 14





            Some others  in  the  AIDS  establishment  --  like  Dr.  David
       Heymann, who heads  the office of  research  for  the  World  Health
       Organization's Global Programme  on  AIDS,  and  Harvard   pathology
       professor William Haseltine  --  are  so  hostile to the possibility
       that a vaccine  could  have introduced  AIDS  that  they  refuse  to
       discuss it.  "The origin of the AIDS virus is of  no  importance  to
       science today," Heymann says in a phone interview from Geneva.  "Any
       speculation on how it arose is of no importance."

            Haseltine is   even  more  adamant.   "It's  distracting,  it's
       nonproductive, it's confusing  to  the  public,  and  I  think  it's
       grossly misleading in  terms  of  getting  to the  solution  of  the
       problem," he says.   "It's  over,  it's  done with, it's very, very,
       very unlikely it  happened  that  way,  and  it's  another  nonsense
       article.  It's the worst kind of reporting as far as I'm concerned."

            But you haven't even heard anything about it,  I  say.  "I know
       what the theory is," Haseltine snaps.  You don't think the origin of
       AIDS is a  significant  question?   "It's  not  relevant," Haseltine
       insists.  "Who cares what the origin was?  Who really cares?  If you
       want to do something good, write about  problems  people experience.
       Who cares where it came from?  It's an unanswerable question."

            It may or may not be unanswerable, I say.  "I'm  not interested
       in discussing it," he says again, and we end the conversation.

                            Monkey Virus == Human Virus

            In AIDS  research,  and in any inquiry about it, all roads lead
       to Dr.  Robert  Gallo,  the  federal  government's  preeminent  AIDS
       researcher.  Gallo, the  embattled  chief  of  the  National  Cancer
       Institute's Laboratory of  Tumor Cell Biology in Bethesda, Maryland,
       was more open-minded than Haseltine and Heymann.

            Among the reasons Gallo cites  supporting what he considers the
       settled question of the origin of AIDS in Africa  was  "the  greater
       divergence in people  of  the virus."  "The more divergent a microbe
       is in a population, the more time  it's  had  to diverge, all things
       being equal," Gallo says.  "The divergence in Zaire  is  far greater
       than the divergence  in  the  United  States  or  Europe or anywhere
       else."

            But how  did the virus come  to  infect  Africans?   Thanks  to
       recent research by Gallo's protege, Beatrice Hahn of  the University
       of Alabama, Gallo   notes,  we  now  know  that  there  are  genetic
       sequences of SIV that are extremely  similar  to  HIV-2,  the second
       identified AIDS virus that afflicts people and is  found  mostly  in
       western Africa.  "In other words," Gallo explains, "the monkey virus
       _is_ the human  virus  --  there  are  monkey  viruses  as  close to
       isolates of HIV-2 as HIV-2 isolates are to each other."

            The same is true of HTLV-1, the human T-cell leukemia virus, a
       retrovirus he discovered that causes a form of leukemia in people.
       Genoveffa Franchini in Gallo's lab has found some monkey viruses,
       specifically simian T-cell leukemia  viruses  know  as STLV-1, which
       are, Gallo says,  as  close  to  most  of the human  HTLV-1  viruses
       isolated from the   Caribbean   islands,   southern  United  States,
       southern Japan and equatorial Africa  as  some  STLV-1s  are  to one
       another.

                                      Page 15





            What does this mean?  Logically, it seems to suggest that there
       may well be  a monkey with a virus that exactly matches the one that
       causes AIDS in humans.  So far, however,  nobody's  found  it.   The
       closer counterpart -- the so-called missing link --  has  been found
       in two chimps from Gabon.  But Gallo says that it is nowhere near as
       close as the  two other monkey viruses he described are to HIV-2 and
       HTLV-1..  "Close enough to argue that it might have been a source of
       entry some decades ago," he says.   "But it's not close enough to be
       called equivalent."

            I ask  if Gallo thinks a monkey with a virus  resembling  HIV-1
       will ever be  found.   "I  wouldn't  be shocked if there was another
       species where [the virus] was even  closer  [to HIV than the variant
       found in the two chimps]," he says.  "Nobody would  be  shocked.  It
       would be interesting  and in a sense exciting, but you wouldn't say,
       'I can't believe it.'"

            So I raise the question of whether  Koprowski's  polio vaccine,
       if contaminated with a simian AIDS virus, could have passed it on to
       man.  At first Gallo dismisses the idea.  "Chimps have  a virus like
       ours," he says.   "The  African green monkey doesn't.  So start with
       the basics, okay?  You make an assumption  that it's got to leapfrog
       and change dramatically.   Well, that's ridiculous.   ...  SIV  from
       African green monkeys  is  not  real close to HIV-1.  So, stop right
       there.  It ends your theory.  Period."

            But, I ask, if we know some monkeys have a virtual twin of HIV-
       2, and if  some monkeys have a virtual  twin  of  the  human  T-cell
       leukemia virus, why wouldn't some group of monkeys  somewhere have a
       twin for HIV-1?  Might this monkey virus exist somewhere?

            "Your point is well taken," Gallo says.  "In support of your
       contention is the  fact  that  HTLV-1 is a far more ancient virus in
       man.  A _very_ ancient virus in man.  You can say that conclusively.
       There are Melanesians who were never  exposed to Europeans until the
       last fifty years who are widely infected with HTLV-1  .... Yet, yet,
       there are HTLV-1s  that are virtually identical to some monkey STLV-
       1s, even though it's had much longer to evolve [in man].  Similarly,
       HIV-2 is probably an older infection  in  man than HIV-1.  Yet there
       are HIV-2s and  SIVs  that  are  almost identical  --  that  are  as
       identical as many HIV-2s are to each other.

            "Therefore, you would suppose that in a newer infection of man,
       you would be far more likely to find an identical virus in a species
       of monkeys," says  Gallo.  "That's the support of your notion.  Very
       much so.  Against it is that a great  number  of  species  have been
       looked at without finding anything.

            "Maybe I'll just say I would have expected somebody  would have
       found it by  now," Gallo says.  "But maybe we just haven't looked at
       anywhere near enough monkeys.  Because  I guess you could argue that
       even a monkey  species  where we think we know the  virus  [exists],
       that it could have a second virus [equivalent to HIV].  And that not
       all monkeys are infected with that second virus, and that we haven't
       hit the monkey that is."

            After pausing  for  thought, Gallo adds, "I don't think that we
       can easily come upon that data, though, because there's not a lot of
       experiments being done on monkeys in the wild in Africa."

                                      Page 16




                             A Theoretical Possibility

            But even    assuming   that   a   monkey   version   of   human
       immunodeficiency virus exists,  Gallo,   like  Koprowski,  initially
       questions whether it would grow in monkey kidney cells  and  whether
       enough virus would be in the preparation to infect people -- perhaps
       through lesions in  their  mouths,  through  mucous membranes in the
       mouths or, since the vaccine was  sprayed  into  people's mouths and
       some of it  may  have become airborne, through the  lungs  into  the
       bloodstream.  After hearing  how the polio vaccines were prepared in
       the Fifties, Gallo  concedes  that  in  some  fashion  this  way  of
       transmitting AIDS is  "a  theoretical possibility."   One  important
       issue is whether the virus can be absorbed through mucous membranes.
       Gallo has his doubts, but Haseltine and others think it can.

            Earlier in  our  talk,  before  I  broached  the  polio-vaccine
       theory, Gallo discussed the case of  a  Norwegian seaman who visited
       an east African coastal city in the mid-Sixties, became sick with an
       AIDS-like illness in  1966  and  died  in 1976 at age  thirty  after
       infecting his wife and a daughter, who died shortly thereafter.  The
       family's blood-serum specimens  were  tested in the mid-Eighties and
       were positive for HIV.

            Gallo reminds me of the Norwegian sailor's case.  "That sort of
       thing goes against" the theory, he  says, noting that the sailor was
       only known to have been in east Africa, some 700 miles away from the
       Kivu.

            The virus  "sure  traveled,"  says  Gallo  sarcastically.    He
       pauses, considering the  large numbers of people inoculated with the
       oral polio vaccine.  "It _might_ travel," he says, "but if those are
       rural people, I  wouldn't  expect  it  to  travel  to  east  African
       prostitutes that fast."
                                  It Could Happen

            But the vaccine wasn't administered only in  rural  areas.   It
       was given to  at least 75,000 people in Leopoldville, a port city on
       the Congo River that was on a major trade route and that was visited
       at the time by around a million people  a year, according to a paper
       by Koprowski and his colleagues.

            After hearing  these facts, Gallo pauses and  then  says:   "It
       could happen."

            Well, I  ask,  based on the circumstantial case alone, wouldn't
       it be wise to check Koprowski's seed stocks?

            "Sure, why not?" Gallo says.   "Certainly it's not a hard thing
       to do.  How can I argue against checking the seed stocks?   I  think
       clearly that would  be  interesting.   You  have  to  say  what they
       [Koprowski and his colleagues] were  doing  was a good thing, trying
       to help people."

            Absolutely, I  agreed.   If  this  happened,  it  would  be  as
       unintended an effect as -- Gallo cut me off.  "It happens sometimes,
       in medicine."

                       Epilog:  Avoiding Future Catastrophes

            At my suggestion, Dr. Robert Bohannon of Baylor College of

                                      Page 17




       Medicine has already written to Koprowski in Philadelphia requesting
       samples of his  Congo vaccine so that the material can be tested for
       the presence of extraneous viruses  including HIV.  Koprowski hasn't
       yet responded, but  the  pressure on him to do so may  be  building.
       The original source  for this story, Blaine Elswood, has submitted a
       paper to a European medical journal,  which has sent Elswood's paper
       to Koprowski for comment.

            Bohannon has   also  written  to  the  U.S.   Food   and   Drug
       Administration requesting access  to  early  seed stocks of the Salk
       and Sabin vaccines.  The FDA has agreed  to  supply seed stocks from
       1976 on.  But Bohannon won't be getting any earlier samples -- there
       isn't enough of  this  material  left.  Dr. Gerald  Quinnan,  acting
       director of the   agency's   Center  for  Biologics  Evaluation  and
       Research, tells me that Sabin's original  seed stocks from the early
       Sixties were not tested even by the World Health Organization in the
       middle Eighties when concern about simian AIDS was  high.   That was
       because there are "only a small number of vials" of the preparation,
       Quinnan says, and tests "might use it all up."

            In his  1991  book  _Virus Hunting_, Robert Gallo suggests that
       probing for the origins of AIDS and  especially  seeking to find out
       whether a monkey carries the virus that causes AIDS  in people is an
       important quest.  "We  may  never  know  for  certain the answers to
       these questions," he writes, "but  they  are  of  more than academic
       interest because answering  them  may  help  avoid  future  zoonotic
       catastrophes -- that  is, transmission of disease from lower animals
       to humans."

            Current methods  of  growing   the   Sabin  poliovirus  vaccine
       "eliminate most of   the  blood  and  lymphocytes"   known   to   be
       susceptible to the AIDS viruses, Quinnan tells me.  Preparations are
       monitored, and that  "provides  assurance that there is freedom from
       most agents," he says.  As for being sure the stuff is free from all
       agents, like some new retrovirus  we  don't  yet know about, Quinnan
       says:  "No, you can never prove something absolutely.   However,  as
       far as we  know,  the system we use doesn't result in any extraneous
       viruses."

            Like Salk and Sabin, Koprowski  had  the  best  intentions:  He
       wanted to eradicate  a  debilitating and deadly scourge.   But  with
       what we know  now, it's clear there was a certain hubris involved in
       the rough-and-ready campaigns to conquer  polio.   There is evidence
       that all three  pioneers  used  vaccines inadvertently  contaminated
       with viruses from  a  species  dangerously close to our own.  If the
       Congo vaccine turns out not to  be  the  way  AIDS  got  started  in
       people, it will be because medicine was lucky, not  because  it  was
       infallible.
