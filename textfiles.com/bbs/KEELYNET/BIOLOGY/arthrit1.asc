                      "Proven Cure for Rheumatoid Arthritis"

       Sometimes the simplest  things  can  benefit  us.   Nature  has many
       secrets and in making that statement  it  becomes  apparent  we have
       much to learn  from  the  old girl.  What follows is  one  of  those
       secrets revealed that has amazed us in it actually working.

       First off before  we proceed, I must state that the cure is a simple
       one but may  cause  a hazardous situation  for  some.   If  you  are
       allergic to stings of any kind then proceed with caution.

       Back in the  eighties  Judi was stricken with Rheumatoid  Arthritis.
       The crippling condition  had  progressed to the point that she could
       not get up from a chair or move about  without  difficulty and pain.
       Each month it seemed to get worse.  The long term prospect  for  her
       condition was a wheel chair or being bed ridden, not a happy thought
       for one who loved being outdoors.

       David, her son,  was interested in bees and had a couple of hives in
       the back yard.  It soon became time  to  remove  the  honey from the
       hives.  Judi, not one to be left out, got involved  in  helping with
       the removal of  the  honey.   They  smoked  the hive making the bees
       docile and less aggressive to their endeavor.

       Somehow several bees got under Judi's  blouse  and immediately stung
       her on her midsection.

       By the next day all symptoms of her arthritic condition had vanished
       quite to her surprise.  She called an acquaintance  who  knew  a lot
       about bees and told him of her miraculously relieved condition.

       Yes, he said bees have been known in bee circles for quite awhile as
       a cure for her type arthritic condition.

       So there you have it.  If I weren't a witness to her being fit years

       after the dilemma  was  resolved I'd be a skeptic, but the proofs in
       seeing her completely free of this debilitating disease.

       Hope this helps other sufferers of arthritis out there.
       Please be sure that you are not allergic to honey bee stings
       before trying this.

       The best way to get honey bees is  to  catch  them  in a pint jar as
       they are getting pollen from flowers and the hold  the  jar  against
       you mid section after agitating them in the jar. A few stings should
       do the trick.  This  is  an old mountain cure used in the Blue Ridge
       Mountains of N.C.
