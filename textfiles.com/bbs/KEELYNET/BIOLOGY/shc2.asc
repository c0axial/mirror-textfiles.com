                                   MARY REESER:
                                  A Case Study in
                           Spontaneous Human Combustion
                           ----------------------------

       The 1951 death  of  Mrs.  Mary Reeser of St. Petersburg, FL, who was
       found reduced to ashes in a practically  undamaged  apartment, was a
       landmark case of  spontaneous human combustion because  it  was  the
       first instance where   every  possible  tool  of  modern  scientific
       investigation was used to determine  the  cause  of  this mysterious
       phenomenon. Yet despite  the  efforts  of the FBI,  fire  officials,
       arson experts, and pathologists, a year after the incident Detective
       Cass Burgess of the St. Petersburg police commented as follows:

               Our investigation has turned up nothing that could
               be singled out as proving, beyond a doubt, what
               actually happened. The case is still open. We are
               still as far from establishing any logical cause
               for the death as we were when we first entered
               Mrs. Reeser's apartment.

       And Dr. Wilton   M.   Krogman,  a  physical  anthropologist  at  the
       University of Pennsylvania's School of Medicine and a world-renowned
       expert on the effects of fire on  the  human  body,  finally gave up
       trying to figure out what happened. Dr. Krogman said:

               I regard it as the most amazing thing I have ever
               seen. As I review it, the short hairs on my neck
               bristle with vague fear. Were I living in the Middle
               Ages, I'd mutter something about Black Magic.

       Here are the details of the case:

           Mrs. Mary Hardy Reeser, an agreeable, motherly  widow of 67, was
           living in  St.  Petersburg,  Florida,  to  be  near her son, Dr.
           Richard Reeser. On the evening of July 1, 1951, she had remained
           in her son's home with one of  her  grandchildren while the rest
           of the family went to the beach. When they returned,  they found
           that Mrs.  Reeser  had  already  left for her own apartment. The
           younger Mrs.  Reeser drove to  her  mother-in-law's  to  see  if
           everything was all right.

           According to her testimony, there was nothing in Mrs. Reeser's

                                      Page 1





           appearance or  demeanor  to  cause any alarm. Dr. Reeser visited
           his mother later that evening.

           She was mildly depressed over  the  fact  that she had not heard
           from two friends who were supposed to rent an apartment  for her
           in anticipation  of  a return trip to Columbia, PA, formerly her
           hometown. His mother told him  that  she  wished to retire early
           and would take two sleeping pills to ensure a good night's rest.
           Dr. Reeser left at about 8:30 PM and returned to his home.

           The last person to see Mrs. Reeser alive was her  landlady, Mrs.
           Pansy M.  Carpenter, who lived in another apartment in the four-
           unit building (the two units between them were unoccupied).

           Mrs. Carpenter saw Mrs. Reeser  briefly  at  about 9 PM. She was
           wearing her nightgown, a housecoat, and black satin slippers and
           was lounging in a comfortable chair smoking a cigarette. The bed
           covers had  been  turned back. Mrs. Reeser's last  night  was  a
           typical summer  night  in  Florida:  the  sky  was overcast with
           occasional flashes of heat lightning in the distance.

           When Mrs. Carpenter woke up Monday morning at 5AM, she noticed a
           slight odor of smoke but was not  alarmed,  since she attributed
           the smell  to  a  water  pump  in  the  garage   that  had  been
           overheating lately. She got up, turned off the pump, and settled
           back into  bed.  When  she  got  up an hour later to collect her
           newspaper outside, she no longer smelled any smoke.

           At 8AM a telegram arrived for Mrs. Reeser. Mrs. Carpenter signed
           the receipt and went to her tenant's  apartment to bring her the
           telegram.  The doorknob, when she placed her  hand  on  it,  was
           hot. Alarmed, she stepped back and shouted for help.

           Two painters  working  across  the  street ran over. One of them
           opened the door; as he entered,  he  felt  a  blast  of hot air.
           Thinking of rescuing Mrs. Reeser, he frantically  looked  around
           but saw  no  signs  of  her.  The  bed was empty. There was some
           smoke, but the only fire was  a  small  flame  on a wooden beam,
           over a partition separating the living room and kitchenette.

           The firemen arrived, put out the small flame with  a  hand pump.
           and tore  away  part of the partition. When Assistant Fire Chief
           S. O. Griffith began his inspection  of  the  premises, he could
           not believe his eyes.

           In the middle of the floor there was a charred area roughly four
           feet in diameter, inside of which he found a number of blackened
           chair springs  and  the  ghastly  remains  of   a   human  body,
           consisting of  a charred liver attached to a piece of the spine,
           a shrunken skull, one foot still  wearing a black satin slipper,
           and a small pile of ashes.

           Coroner Edward T. Silk arrived to examine the  body  and  survey
           the apartment.   Although  deeply  puzzled, he decided the death
           was accidental and authorized  the  removal  of the remains. The
           scooped-up ashes,  the  tiny  shrunken  head, and  the  slipper-
           encased foot were taken by ambulance to a local hospital.

           The ensuing investigation included police and fire officials as

                                      Page 2





           well as  arson  experts.  The  facts that confronted them seemed
           inexplicable considering the great heat necessary to account for
           Mrs. Reeser's incinerated body.

           Little of the furniture, other  than the chair and the end table
           next to  it, was badly damaged, but the apartment  had  suffered
           some peculiar effects.  The ceiling, draperies and walls, from a
           point exactly  four  feet  above  the  floor, were coated with a
           smelly, oily soot. Below this four foot mark there was none.

           The wall paint adjacent to the  chair  was  faintly browned, but
           the carpet  where  the  chair  had rested was  not  even  burned
           through. A  wall  mirror 10 feet away had cracked, probably from
           heat. On a dressing table 12 feet away, two pink wax candles had
           puddled, but their wicks lay undamaged in their holders.

           Plastic wall outlets above the  four  foot mark were melted, but
           the fuses were not blown and the current was on.  The  baseboard
           electrical outlets  were  undamaged.   An electric clock plugged
           into one of the outlets had stopped  at  precisely 4:20, but the
           same clock ran perfectly when plugged into one of the baseboard
           outlets.

           Newspapers nearby  on a table and draperies and  linens  on  the
           daybed close  at  hand  -  all flammable - were not damaged. And
           though the painters and Mrs. Carpenter  had  felt a wave of heat
           when they  opened  the door, no one had noted smoke  or  burning
           odor and there were no embers or flames in the ashes.

       Faced with such  a mystery, the St. Petersburg authorities called in
       the FBI.  Laboratory findings showed  that  Mrs.  Reeser's estimated
       weight of 175 lbs. had been reduced to a total of less than 10
       lbs., including the foot and shrunken head.

       The final report concluded that no known chemical agents or other
       accelerants had been involved in starting the fire.

       Dr. Krogman has burned cadavers with gasoline, oil,  wood,  and  all
       kinds of other  agents.  He  has  experimented with bones encased in
       flesh or stripped,  both moist and  dry.  His  tests  have  utilized
       combustion apparatus ranging from outdoor pyres to  the  most modern
       pressurized crematorium equipment.

       He has demonstrated conclusively that it takes extraordinary heat to
       consume a body,  and that only at over 3000 degrees Fahrenheit would
       bone become volatile enough to lose its shape and leave only ashes.

              "These are very great heats",  he  said,  "that  would  sear,
               char, scorch or otherwise mar or effect anything and
               everything within a considerable radius."

       Another mystery was  the  slippered  left foot, which  Mrs.  Reeser,
       having been in some discomfort, was in the habit of propping up on a
       stool. The foot was left unburned, apparently because it was outside
       the mysterious four-foot radius of incineration.

       Perhaps strangest of  all,  and  unique to this case of SHC, was the
       shrunken skull. Dr. Krogman commented:


                                      Page 3





             ...the head is not left complete in ordinary burning cases.
             Certainly it does NOT shrivel or symmetrically reduce to a
             smaller size. In presence of heat sufficient to destroy soft
             tissues, the skull would literally explode in many pieces.
             I...have never known any exception to this rule.

       The following conversation took place  at 3:17 PM MST on October 16,
       1985, between myself  and Captain Jerry Hubbard, Public  Information
       Officer for the San Jose Fire Department. In reading the transcript,
       pay special attention  to these key elements that seem to crop up in
       _MOST_, but not all, SHC events:

           o  The probable ingestion of alcohol
           o  The victim is usually a loner  type,  and/or is alone at time
              of the event.
           o  An appendage is left untouched.
           o  Surroundings do not catch fire.

       I'm not sure what we're dealing with, but I think it  becomes  clear
       that it is not a non-event or misobservation. And this does not come
       from the Enquirer.

          JS      Tony Russomano gave me your name.
          JH      I know Tony.
          JS      You know Tony, OK.
          JH      Channel 7.
          JS      Right.  We've  been  investigating, sort of as a project,
                         Spontaneous Human Combustion.
          JH      Ah.
          JS      Tony tells me, a couple  of  years  ago,  you  had a real
                         strange one.
          JH      We did.
          JS      OK, what can you tell me about it, was it...solved, or is
                         it still on the strange list?
          JH      No, it hasn't been solved. The situation  is what we call
                         an accidental  fire death. It was in a boxcar in a
                         Southern Pacific  RailRoad  yard.   We were called
                         there, because  somebody spotted  from  a  Thrifty
                         store....said they   saw   smoke   coming  from  a
                         boxcar...When we  got  there  we  had a dead body,
                         completely consumed, 100% all over...
          JS      Not one thing left?
          JH      Not one thing left, well, with the exception  of,  uh,  a
                         quarter of  an  ankle  or something, and where the
                         victim's head was  laying  against the boxcar. Now
                         the strange thing about this...

                                      Page 4





          JS      Yes?
          JH      The only thing that burned was the body!
          JS      Uh, what about the clothing?
          JH      Oh,  and the clothing burned off, yeah, and apparently we
                         are assuming that  the  person  was  in a sleeping
                         bag. That was completely gone.
          JS      The sleeping bag was gone.
          JH      Yeah.  The  only  thing  that  was left  was  kind  of  a
                         skeleton-type thing, uh, burned charred bones, and
                         a foot,  I believe, was burned off. But the boxcar
                         never caught fire.
          JS      The boxcar never...was it a wooden-floored boxcar?
          JH      Yeah, wooden floor, wooden  sides.  And,  when we had the
                         body removed by the coroner's office,  all you saw
                         strictly that,   that  was  burned,  was  maybe  a
                         quarter of an inch of charring. It never caught on
                         fire. Now what  we're  saying  could possibly have
                         happened was that somebody could  have gotten mad,
                         as winos or transient people do, could have soaked
                         the person   in  liquid,  flammable...we  have  no
                         indication of [flammable  liquid]  at all. Ok, the
                         fire was contained strictly to the  body,  and the
                         sleeping bag,  or  blanket,  whatever  it may have
                         been. [But] if  you  had  used flammable liquid it
                         would have   ignited  the  entire   boxcar....that
                         didn't occur.
          JS      Uh-Huh.  Was  there  any  kind  of an oily residue on the
                         sides or walls of the boxcar?
          JH      Ah-hah, see, now you're getting good, that's interesting.
                         We'd probably have to look into the fire report on
                         that, to see if the fire investigator spotted that
                         one at all. Best  I  can recall is that, I went to
                         the scene, got there before the body  was removed,
                         but the  best  I can recall is that, we could tell
                         it was a male,...
          JS      There was no identification made?
          JH      No. I don't know if the  coroners,  from  this  point on,
                         have discovered  who  it might have  been  through
                         dental charts or something.
          JS      Now  you  said before that there was nothing left, except
                         for part of an ankle.  OK,  now when you say that,
                         do you mean that there was nothing  left as far as
                         skin, or his bones [were consumed] or....
          JS      No.  He still had a skull intact and chest intact, but he
                         was charred completely  all  over  his  body.  You
                         wanted just ashes and a foot, huh?  <laughs> Can't
                         give that to ya. No, best I can recall is, that I
                         remember seeing an ankle and a  foot,  by  itself,
                         and the  only way that could have happened is that
                         that foot was sticking  outside  of  the  sack and
                         didn't get  involved,  but  it [the  fire]  stayed
                         there and burned him _severely_, so that he wasn't
                         recognizable at all.

       Vangard note...

           SHC (spontaneous human combustion) has been an interest here for

                                      Page 5





           several years now.  As a result, we have SHC1, a file indicating
           a relationship  between  Deuterium  Oxide  and  this  mysterious
           burning effect.  It has been  called  the  "fire from heaven" in
           ancient times and was believed to have been punishment sent from
           the gods.

           The book  and  movie Alternative Three mentions  the  effect  as
           something which could be directed to a target using some form of
           unspecified technology.

           There is  also  the  possiblity  of  it  being  some  mysterious
           combination of  foods  or  other   factors   which   produce   a
           tremendously hot and highly localized flame.

           Finally, the  work  of  George  Crile led him to  postulate  the
           existence of  what  he termed "radiogens".  These were miniature
           nuclear furnaces within the cells  of  all  bodies consisting of
           flaming iron  suns.   Crile  estimated  the  heat   from   these
           miniature suns as being on the order of 6000 degrees Celsius.

           In addition, the nuclear energy generated in the cell helped the
           body to  fulfill the conversion of mass to energy as well as the
           transmutation of  one mass to  another  as  in  Louis  Kervrans'
           "Biological Transmutation".

           The reason  why bodies fail to incinerate from these  tremendous
           temperatures is due to the nature of the inverse square law.  As
           the energy  radiates  from  the  central  mass,  it cools due to
           spreading over successively greater distances.

           If for  some  reason,  these nuclear  furnaces  "went  wild",  a
           fissioning process  could result leading to the  end  result  of
           "spontaneous human combustion".

           We therefore  need  to  seek  the  "triggers" which lead to such
           fissioning.
