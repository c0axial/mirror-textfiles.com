                    INEXPENSIVE ABUSED SUBSTANCES SUBSTITUTION
                                        by
                              Richard L. Clark, Ph.D

       It is an  extremely interesting omission that none of the literature
       on the subject of Extremely Low  Frequency  (ELF)  systems  and  its
       effects on humans mentions drug or alcohol simulation capabilities.

       Because ELF can create exactly the same mental effects as drugs like
       cocaine, heroin, hashish,  LSD, marijuana and alcohol.   Very  large
       vested commercial interests   have   deliberately   suppressed  this
       information.

       The social costs in crime, deaths, and ruined lives due to drugs and
       alcohol is enormous in our society.   So,  while I do not personally
       condone or respect substance abuse in any form, I feel  it necessary
       to eliminate the dangers, damage and costs of such habits.

       The human brain  hemispheres  operate  on  separate ear inputs, thus
       stereo sound systems.  But of more  immediate  interest  is the fact
       that the frequency effect internal to the brain, is  the  difference
       frequency between the separate ear frequency inputs.

       Thus, if you  input 10 Hz in one ear and 18 Hz in the other ear, the
       brain hemispheres internally will  have  the  8  Hz difference.  The
       effects of 8 Hz are the meditation or ESP states in humans.

       Amazingly, the abuse  substance  reactions  are   near   this   same
       frequency.  The exact   reaction   frequency  varies  slightly  from
       individual to individual, but can  easily  be  found by tuning until
       reaction is achieved by the individual.

       All that is  needed  to  use this system is two inexpensively  built
       audio oscillators and stereo earphones.  One audio oscillator can be
       a fixed frequency,  say  20  Hz,  and  the  other oscillator tunable
       between 1 Hz and 100 Hz.

       Each oscillator is connected to  one  earphone  only,  thus  an  ELF
       difference system is possible.  The designs of ELF  oscillators  and
       amplifiers are available everywhere, along with the electronic parts
       stores.  The stereo earphones cost about $25 to $30.

       The advantages of this system are:

            o  Low initial costs (under $60.)

            o  Minimum operating costs (batteries)

            o  No after effects - turn it off and you are turned off
               immediately .

            o  Crime and antisocial behavior decreases.

            o  Criminal element revenue and control losses.

            o  Perfectly legal

            o  Not injurious to the body.
