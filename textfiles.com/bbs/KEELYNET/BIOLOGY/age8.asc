                              Youth Pill Finally Here
                              by Dorothy Larson-Dale

       Scientists say that  selenium - a mineral you can buy in health food
       stores - significantly slows the  aging  process  and  will keep you
       looking and feeling young years longer.

       The astonishing discovery was made after a 25-year  research project
       conducted by teams  of  dedicated  chemists  at  the  University  of
       California.

       The researchers described selenium as an essential nutrient found in
       seafoods and meats.

       In addition to retarding the body's  aging  process,  it also guards
       against organ damage caused by smoking and drinking.

       An environmental research  chemist  at  the  university's  food  and
       science department said  an  insufficient  amount of selenium in the
       human body can cause crippling muscle degeneration.

       But it is the discovery that selenium  retards  aging  and  prolongs
       youth that has electrified the scientific world.

       "In the test   tube,  selenium  is  a  powerful  protector   against
       oxidation," declared a  biochemist  involved in the amazing research
       project.  "And oxidation is believed to be one of the main causes of
       aging."

       An independent researcher,  Robert   Evans   -  whose  studies  were
       unrelated to those  at  the  University  of California  -  said  the
       mineral preserves the  elasticity  of  the  body  tissue by delaying
       oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty  acids,  thus  stalling the aging
       process.

       "Selenium was once regarded as not needed by the human  body," Evans
       told the News, "It was even thought to be dangerous."

       "It is now  going  to  be one of the ways we maintain our health and
       prevent degenerative disease.

       "But the outstanding research done  in  California  will  put  those
       notions to rest.

       "In addition to prolonging youth, there is strong evidence that

       selenium taken in  daily  doses  reduces  the  risk of breast, lung,
       prostate, colon and ovarian cancers and maintains a healthy heart."

       Selenium, also found in minute amounts  in  the  human body, is sold
       over-the-counter in most health food stores and in  some drugstores.
       A bottle of 250 tablets, each containing 50 mcgs. of selenium, sells
       for about $10  to  $11.   The  general  dosage is one or two tablets
       daily.

       Vangard note....

            Other information regarding selenium  as found in certain forms
            shows that EXCESS amounts can lead to brittle hair and nails.

            The above article offers an interesting viewpoint  when  viewed
            in light of the information available in DNAMAST1 on KeelyNet.

            In the  early  days  of  electronics,  selenium  was  used  for
            rectification of AC currents.  This semi-conducting property of
            selenium offers the possibility  that  this  substance might be
            used in the body to rectify AC transients to provide an overall
            higher level of available DC energy to the body.

            The modern  works of Crile, Becker and Bergstrom  among  others
            leads us to the inescapable fact that the body uses DC currents
            primarily for electrical tone as well as ion transport.

            The idea is that aging is caused by twisting of the DNA and RNA
            helices to  reduce  the number of base pairs per turn.  This in
            turn functions much like reducing the number of windings of the
            secondary of a coil in respect to the primary.

            As the voltage is reduced the  ability  of  the  body  to enact
            ionic transference of chemical substances and fluids is greatly
            impaired.
