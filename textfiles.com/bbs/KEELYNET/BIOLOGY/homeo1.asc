       Keep in mind  when  you  read  this, that the entire Royal Family of
       England uses ONLY homeopathic medicine  to  MAINTAIN  their  health.
       This is a VERY OLD and ACCEPTED practice in Europe  and  only in the
       countries with entrenched  and vested interest groups do we see this
       practice derided (can you say AMA?).

                      Healing by Raising the Blood Frequency
                            written by Jerry W. Decker
              based on personal correlations and thoughts as well as
                           using information taken from
               "Rays and Radiation Phenomena" by Dr. Oscar Brunler

       Homeopathy is defined as a system  of  medical  practice that treats
       disease using minute doses of a remedy that would in healthy persons
       produce symptoms of the disease being treated.  Homeopathic reagents
       contain only minute  traces of the substance in varying  degrees  of
       potency.  Generally, the higher the potency, the greater the effect.
       This phenomenon is  directly  opposed to the accepted principle that
       large amounts of a drug produce greater effects.  A homeopathic pill
       can contain anywhere from one hundred thousandth to only a millionth
       part of a   substance  in  the  higher   potencies.    Despite   the
       microscopic levels of the chemical or mineral used  in a homeopathic
       pill, the effect can be extremely powerful.

       A drop of  reagent  is  generally placed on a small pill, usually of
       sugar.  The sugar crystals dissolve  and  re-aggregate  in a pattern
       which closely approximates the geometric form of the reagent on both
       atomic and molecular  levels.   Barring  exposure  to  high  density
       fields, the sugar  pill  will retain the "programmed pattern" of the
       reagent in it's crystalline structure  for  a  great period of time.
       These pills are  placed under the tongue to allow rapid  dissolution
       and absorption of  the  pattern into the body.  When the "programmed
       pattern" comes into contact with living tissues and the body fluids,
       the movement of the fluids will provide  agitation  which "patterns"
       the reagent onto the fluid and eventually into the cells.

       Brunler gives a   short   story   illustrating   the    potency   of
       homeopathically treated substances.    A   very  well  known  doctor
       practicing homeopathy, had a young man as a patient.  This young man
       was 22 years of age, strong and solidly built.  For many weeks the

                                      Page 1





       doctor tried to cure this patient of some organic disorder.  All his
       attempts to improve the condition had failed.  Being at a loss as to
       what to do,  he  consulted  another  doctor  who  knew the patient's
       condition and who was considered a great expert in homeopathy.  This
       medical man suggested  that he should  give  the  patient  the  same
       medicine but in  a  higher  potency, about 50M (1 part  medicine  to
       50,000 parts water).    When  the  patient  consulted  his  original
       doctor, he was given the medicine and instructed to place the little
       pill below his tongue.  Within a  few  seconds,  the  young man fell
       dead.

       What happens when we potentize a medicine?  As an example,  take one
       cubic centimeter of concentrated hydrochloric acid and dissolve this
       one cubic centimeter  into  10  cubic centimeters of water.  We will
       call this mixture A.  This gives a  ratio of 1:10.  (1M = 1:1000, 2M
       = 1:2000, 10M = 1:10,000, etc.)

       Normal homeopathic treatments require succussion or  rapid agitation
       of the mixture  for  several  minutes.   This excites the mixture on
       multiple physical levels which allows  the  pattern of the substance
       to be more  easily impressed on the atomic and molecular  levels  of
       the combined fluids.   Again, take one cubic centimeter of mixture A
       and add 10 cubic centimeters of water.  We will call this mixture B.
       This is also rapidly agitated.  We now have a ratio of 1 part to 100
       or 1:100 (10 parts in the mixture  A  X  10  parts  in the mixture B
       gives 100 or 1 part acid to 100 parts water.)

       Now, if we  repeat the process a third time for mixture  C,  1  part
       (cubic centimeter) of  mixture  B  added  to 10 cubic centimeters of
       water, we have a ratio of 1:1000  (100  parts  from  mixture  B X 10
       parts from mixture C gives 1000 parts of water to 1 part acid.)

       In other words, the final third mixture contains one  thousandth  of
       the original cubic centimeter of hydrochloric acid.  This particular
       mixture is therefore  rated  1M  (for 1000) and is considered a very
       low potency.  The  more  a substance  is  diluted,  the  higher  the
       potency becomes and  the  smaller  the  quantity  of   the  original
       chemical in the solution.  In very high potencies, the final mix can
       be as high as one millionth part of the original medicine.

       The more we force the molecules of a substance to expand, the higher
       the frequency of   the   substance   becomes.    This  can  best  be
       illustrated by a  simple analogy.   If  several  drops  of  ink  are
       dropped into a  glass of water and the mixture stirred,  the  entire
       glass of water will become a homogeneous mixture.

       The color of  the  ink  began  as  black or dark blue.  If light was
       directed through the ink, nothing  would  pass  due  to  the intense
       concentration of darkness  from the low frequency  of  the  compound
       colors in the  ink.   However,  when  the ink molecules are expanded
       throughout the water, the wavelength  of  the ink radiation changes.
       This can be  shown  by  shining the same beam of light  through  the
       water.  The light  which  passes  through  will  be of a much higher
       frequency than when  attempted  to   pass  through  the  aggregated,
       concentrated ink drops.   Of  course, this is in truth  due  to  the
       dispersion of the  concentrated  ink molecules throughout the entire
       water area.

       The frequency increase is due to an increase in the DI-ELECTRIC

                                      Page 2





       POTENTIAL of the  ink  molecules.   This phenomenon is due to one of
       three possible explanations.   The   first   entails   the  physical
       separation of the molecules and atoms which provides greater surface
       areas for the  accumulation  of  electric  energy.   This  intensive
       buildup places a  stress  on  the surface of the physical structures
       causing a compression  of  the  surface  areas,  thus  reducing  the
       circumference and the  wavelength  of  these  structures.    As  the
       wavelength decreases through successive potentizing, the frequencies
       increase.

       The second possible  explanation  involves  the concept of colloidal
       structures (spongy structures having  extremely  high  surface areas
       which contain numerous convolutions).  As the molecular  and  atomic
       components of the substance expands, the electrical energy increases
       due to increased  surface  area.   This  process  adds energy to the
       compound frequencies always present  in  ALL  MASS  aggregations  on
       various levels, i.e.,  molecular,  inter-molecular,  atomic,  inter-
       atomic, etc..  When  energy  is added, the frequencies are amplified
       on all levels  with  the highest amplitude  and  lowest  frequencies
       present on the largest structures, i.e. the molecule.   Carrying  on
       the work of  Dr.  Henri  Coanda,  Pat  Flanagan  has  researched the
       properties of colloidal water as detailed in his book "Elixir of the
       Ageless," as did  Victor  Schauberger   and   his  electrically  and
       spirally energized "living water."

       The third possible  explanation again involves the  accumulation  of
       electric charge on  the  exposed  surface  areas  of  the structure.
       However, as the buildup occurs, we find an increase in the repulsion
       of the structures.  This alters the  frequency due to the separation
       of the vibrating structures to literally give them  room to breathe.
       In Keely's words,  they  would  be  allowed  to expand to their full
       "range of expression"  or vibrate  at  the  maximum  amplitude.   Of
       course, the simple  act  of  separating  the structures  from  close
       proximity with other  components  would  allow the full amplitude of
       expression to occur for a discrete  structure.   This  in turn would
       give off frequencies  already  present  in  a  substance   but  with
       amplitudes of sufficient power to be of practical use.

       As can be  seen,  we  are  in reality dealing with radiations in the
       case of homeopathy and not the simple effects of chemical reactions.
       As George Lakhovsky said, "Life is a WAR OF RADIATIONS."

       This phenomenon is also seen in the  compounding of high frequencies
       to aggregate into a lower overall wavelength.  If the  wavelength is
       "unwound" through spectral   analysis  techniques  such  as  Fourier
       Transformation, we can see the amplitude  and  spectral  band  of  a
       specific wave.

       It becomes apparent from the study of the work of John Keely that he
       was aware of this "compounding" of high frequencies  to generate the
       low frequencies and  how  this  process  could  be  reversed through
       interference or addition  to GENERATE  HIGH  FREQUENCIES  FROM  LOW.
       From this process, we gain a much advanced understanding  of many of
       his experiments and principles.

       Brunler continues with  an  anecdote  regarding  a  trip  he made to
       Lialpur, in Northern India.  He was  shown  an  18 year old bull who
       had been impotent  in  excess  of 6 years.  An experiment  had  been
       carried out which apparently involved the potentizing of the blood

                                      Page 3





       of the animal  with  subsequent re-injection into the body.  Shortly
       after the re-injection, the bull  again  became  potent and produced
       over 6 calves.

       Months later, on Dr. Brunler's return to London,  a  female  patient
       asked that he  examine  her  dying  husband.   Two  other doctors in
       charge of the case had given the 72  year  old man from 2 to 10 days
       to live.

       After a personal examination, Brunler had to agree  that the man had
       no hope due   to  his  advanced  condition.   While  discussing  the
       patient's condition, he recalled  the  experiment  with  the bull as
       well as similar  experiments  carried  out  in  Switzerland.    This
       technique was discussed  with  the  doctors  and  the  wife  of  the
       patient, all agreed  that  they   had   nothing  to  lose  and  gave
       permission to proceed.

       One cubic centimeter  of  the patient's blood was  removed  for  Dr.
       Brunler's trip back to London.  On arrival, the blood was potentized
       using standard homeopathic  techniquess.   (unfortunately, we do not
       know the dose)

       The next day, the potentized blood was sent to the country where the
       patient lived and one of the doctors  injected  the  blood back into
       the patient.

       After two days,  Brunler's secretary said that a man  was  anxiously
       waiting to see  him  but  refused to give his name.  On entering the
       waiting room, Brunler states that  he  was  totally surprised to see
       the man who had been on his deathbed only three days ago.

       The swelling in his legs had gone, the blue lips looked  again  red,
       and his whole appearance was that of a healthy man.  Four and a half
       years later, while  Brunler  was away from England, the patient died
       peacefully.

       Another story utilizing  this  technique   again  involved  a  dying
       patient.  Within seventy hours after the intra-venous  injection  of
       the patient's potentized  blood,  he  was  healthy enough to take an
       extended trip to North Africa.  This  patient  died five years later
       after he was given up for hopeless.

       Brunler writes that  many  similar results were obtained  and  these
       forced him to  seek  to  discover  the secret which lay behind these
       astonishing recoveries.  The   aforementioned    increase   in   the
       frequency of the reagent is Brunler's discovery.

       These anecdotes by  Brunler  are  what  brought  about  this  entire
       article for the   PLENUM.    It  is  very  exciting  that  something
       involving such a  simple procedure  could  produce  such  miraculous
       results.

       There appear to be many possibilities for this treatment which might
       positively affect a  wide  range  of symptoms and diseases.   Steven
       Braun suggested the  addition  of  H2O2  (hydrogen  peroxide) to the
       blood with subsequent  potentizing.    This  of  course  offers  the
       possibility of adding OZONE to the mixture.

       There is also the possibility of succussing under the static field

                                      Page 4





       of a North  pole  magnet  or  an  alternating North pole field.  The
       Japanese find that  both  North   and   South   magnetic  poles  are
       beneficial, whether static or alternating.

       We hope this  information  has  proved of benefit and  a  source  of

       1994 addendum

       I had forgotten about this particular  article  until  our  February
       Roundtable meeting.  We were discussing several subjects and somehow
       I got going on this frequency multiplying effect  that  occurs  from
       homeopathic succussion (rapid shaking).

       Dan Haley said he had never heard that explanation before and wanted
       additional, preferably printed  details.   I  thought  it  had  been
       placed on KeelyNet in the early  days  (we  have  been  online since
       1989), but on checking could find no record of it, so here it is for
       those who might be interested in such subjects.

       There is a term used by Homeopathic practitioners for this frequency
       raising of the blood, but this is all old information  and  I cannot
       recall the exact  term,  something  preceded by AUTO.  I want to say
       AutoImmune but that does not ring true.

       If you decide to try any of this,  study  the subject as much as you
       can and preferably work with someone knowledgable in  the field.  It
       can be dangerous.

       Keely said "oscillations occur across the diameter of the mass".  So
       the smaller a  mass  gets,  the  higher the frequency BECAUSE of the
       shorter wavelength.  Wavelength is  the  distance  it  takes for one
       wave to make a complete cycle, where a cycle is one  positive  going
       wave followed by  one  negative going wave in one second.  Frequency
       is the number of these waves that  pass a fixed point in one second.
       The higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength.

       Short waves tend to transfer more energy per second than long waves.
       This is because the wave packets (one cycle) of short waves strike a
       target many MORE times over the same period of time  than the longer
       waves.  Thus, you  get  more  "hits"  from the higher frequencies to
       accumulate more energy from each wave packet over the same period of
       time.
