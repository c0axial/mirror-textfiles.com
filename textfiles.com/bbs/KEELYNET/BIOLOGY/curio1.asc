       Vangard Note...

           The following file is a most curious bit of information we found
           in the  Journal  of Borderland Research.  It describes a strange
           phenomenon relating to the spinning  of  a magnet when suspended
           over a painful area.  There is a possibility that  some  form of
           vortex is  being  projected and picked up by the magnet.  As the
           magnet intercepts  the  vortex,   it   helps  to  dissipate  the
           accumulation of  energy  which  causes the pain  and  stops  its
           spinning when that point is reached.

           We would greatly appreciate any experiments you might perform in
           this area  since  it  could  very  well benefit a lot of people.
           Thanks.

                     The Balancing Effect of Carbon and Magnet

       "Here's something interesting to report using a COPPER-COATED CARBON
       ROD and a big, 15-3/4 pound magnet,  with  an average Gauss of 2000.
       It cost me $7.50 at a surplus store on Canal St.  in  New  York.   I
       suspended the magnet  on  a  short cord with a loop so that it would
       fit easily over my hand while holding it.

       "A woman aged 46 had an ovary removed  about  8-9  years ago and has
       had trouble with the remaining ovary ever since.  At the beginning

                                      Page 1





       of menstrual cycles,  she  would  double  up  with  sharp, shooting,
       excruciating pains in the remaining  ovary  area,  not each time but
       many times.  She had such pains last night and being  a  good friend
       of the gal  I  chum  around with, we visited her with the magnet and
       carbon rod to ask her if she would  be  gamr  to  try  something, no
       results guaranteed.

       When I told her what our plans were she looked insulted!   She  said
       it seemed silly  and  unworkable but she had nothing to lose, except
       maybe part of the pain!  So we tried  it,  following along the lines
       suggested by the Goeke Article.  I placed the carbon rod against her
       back in the  approximate  position  of  the  remaining  ovary,  then
       suspended the magnet  over her lower abdominal area about six inches
       above the skin.

       It remained MOTIONLESS  for about  20  seconds  or  so,  THEN  BEGAN
       SPINNING SLOWLY CLOCKWISE, then PICKED UP SPEED VERY  RAPIDLY  until
       it was really  moving,  much  like  a  rotating wheel on an axle.  I
       certainly did not expect this, so stopped the movement manually with
       my other hand.  It soon STARTED UP  AGAIN  on this time I let it go.
       It stopped in about 1/2 minute OF ITS OWN ACCORD.   I  then took the
       cord but the magnet remained motionless this time.

       In about 10  seconds  or so it began a slight movement which evolved
       into a rather  large  circle, about  six  inches  across,  and  this
       swinging was in a counter-clockwise direction, exactly  the opposite
       of the rapid  spinning motion just preceding it!  "It STOPPED OF ITS
       OWN ACCORD IN ABOUT A MINUTE or so  and  I took the magnet away.  We
       were so busy  talking  about the peculiar motion of  the  magnet  we
       forgot all about what we had come there for!

       I then asked  the  woman how she felt and the way she said, "I don't
       feel a thing" made me think she had suddenly gone numb!  I asked her
       again about the pain and then she  said  what she meant was that she
       couldn't feel any pain anyone.  She got up and moved  around  a  bit
       but still couldn't find any trace of pain in that area.  I asked her
       to concentrate on  that  area  and the pain that had been there, but
       even this didn't bring it back; nor  did  various  body motions that
       varied the pressure in that area.  All this last night  and the pain
       hasn't returned as of this afternoon the following day, and her flow
       is fuller than usual.

       "What all this  means  I'm  sure  I  don't know as this was my first
       experience with a magnet and carbon  rod.   Such  a  thing may never
       happen again.  What puzzles me most is the RAPID SPINNING  ACTION of
       the magnet, as  this sort of thing wasn't discussed as a possibility
       in the Goeke  article.  Let me know  if  you  would  like  a  sample
       copper-coated carbon rod."
