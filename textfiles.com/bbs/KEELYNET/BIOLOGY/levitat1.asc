                 A description and demonstration of anti-gravity.

       Neutral centers of mass are the energy focal points wherein the spin
       energy flow can be stopped, causing weightlessness.  Keely mentioned
       the neutral centers specifically, and used them in his research.

       To understand how this works, consider a bar magnet, with a positive
       and a negative  pole.   In  the  exact  center of the magnetic force
       field, there exists a neutral center,  from  which  an  OUTWARD push
       exists.  This is  called  a  Bloch  Wall,  or  a diamagnetic  field.
       Because the earth  has  magnetic  poles,  and  because  the earth is
       spinning at approximately 1000 miles per hour, there are Bloch Walls
       at various locations around the globe.

       In these areas, it is possible to  neutralize  the  spin energy of a
       mass at its neutral center, and create weightlessness.  In a smaller
       scale example, to  be described later in the text,  you  can  create
       this same effect anywhere on the globe, and perform a levitation.

       There are 20 of these Bloch Walls, or grid points around the globe.
       On these grid points, you will find artifacts such as the pyramids,
       Stonehenge, the Coral Castle, and, of course, the Bermuda Triangle.
       The architects of  these  designs  understood  how  to  utilize  the
       neutral centers of mass, especially  at  times  when the forces were
       greatest, such as  during  the  predawn  hours, and  during  certain
       solar/lunar cycles, which  is  why  stonehange,  for  example, is an
       extremely precise solar/lunar calendar.

       In modern times, our scientists locate  their gravitational research
       centers at locations  such  as Los Alamos, and use  the  energy  for
       levitation of other  types  of  devices.  Ancient astronomers in the
       grid areas may have been using their  data  to better understand and
       to predict the  effect of "heavenly" forces on the  grid  locations,
       which was passed along to the populace as "religion".

       Miracles, indeed, could be performed at peak energy times.

       You may have  heard  of  "ley  lines", which are the grid lines that
       connect the grid points.  The vast  preponderence  of  UFO sightings
       occur along these lines, which presupposes that either a grid survey
       is taking place, or that the UFOs are utilizing the energy along

                                      Page 1





       these lines.  Because   these   lines   and   the  grid  points  are
       strategically significant, governments  struggle  to  control  them.
       For example, grid  points  exist  in  Korea,  Vietnam,   Cuba,   the
       Falklands, etc..

       Where a grid  point  is  located  over water, such as at the Bermuda
       Triangle, and there are other locations  as  well,  the  Bloch  Wall
       effect can cause temporary gravitational inversions.   This  results
       in effectively "launching"   objects  far  into  space,  or  into  a
       space/time warp, similar to the Philadelphia Experiment.

       These anomalies are  predictable,   but   the   information  is  not
       available, because to release the information would  acknowledge  an
       understanding of the  forces  involved, and all governments in world
       history have kept this information classified.

       To demonstrate levitation, based upon the grid point model, you will
       need a group of four "lifters",  preferably  two  each  of  male and
       female, and a  volunteer to sit in a chair.  The chair  should  face
       north/south, and the lifters should be at the NE, NW, SE, SW compass
       points.  The lifters  should  be  standing  next  to a person of the
       opposite sex at these points.

       Two should be  just  behind  the  shoulders  of  the  person  to  be
       levitated, and two should be standing facing each other  beside  the
       knees of the person to be levitated.

       The actual lifting  will  be  done using the two index fingers only,
       with arms parallel, fists together,  palms  down.   However,  before
       lifting, you must  first  create  the  neutral  center   around  the
       volunteer.  To do  this,  have  the lifters stack their hands on the
       head of the volunteer, so that male and female hands are alternated,
       i.e., no male hands touching male  hands,  no  female hands touching
       female hands, and no one touching their own hands.  Press down for a
       count of ten, remove the hands quickly, and place the  fingers under
       the knees and  armpits  of  the  volunteer,  using  the  fingers  as
       described above, and the volunteer will levitate easily.

       This works because the lifters have  positioned  themselves as lobes
       of the energy grid, and in combining their energies in the 10 second
       "charge" have neutralized the center mass, ie, the  volunteer.   The
       volunteer could just  as  easily be a large stone, and the principle
       would work exactly the same.

       In an actual grid point location,  where  the earths energies assist
       in the process,  a  single  person  can  levitate large  objects  by
       resonating the mass's neutral center, such as with Ed Leedskalnin's
       "singing" to the stones.

       What does this mean to researchers of free energy, who often observe
       gravitational anomalies?  It means that their devices have resonated
       at their neutral  centers,  which stops the natural spin energy, and
       which effectively places these devices in a "gravity free" zone.

       Demonstrate this for yourself, and enjoy.

       Vangard notes

          This is  a very old "parlor" trick which has been documented many
          times.  Arthur Ford detailed  this  in  one  of  his books in the
          early 1900's.   Joel  has  come  up with an interesting  approach
          using Keely's Neutral Centre as a possible explanation.

          I first  did  this  experiment  when  about  12 years old, it was
          followed by numerous other times  and  always  "works".  We never
          worried about N/S orientation or alternate sexes.

          The heaviest  person we ever "lifted" weighed about  300  pounds.
          Our method  also required 4 people, using alternate stacked hands
          held over the head of the person  to  be lifted.  While the hands
          were held  over  the  head,  all lifters took 3 deep  synchronous
          breaths.

          Immediately following  the last inhalation, we removed our hands,
          placed the  left  and right forefingers  together,  inserted  our
          forefingers either under the armpits or at the crook  of the knee
          and lifted.   It  was always amazing how easily the person lifted
          and how light they were not only during the lift but also when at
          the maximum lift point.  We could  hold  them  there for up to 30
          seconds, but usually let them down after that.

          Those many years ago, I came to the conclusion  that  there  were
          one or  more  physiological  processes  involved.  These included
          hyperventilation through breathing  to enhance the oxygen content
          of the blood as well as distributed weight over  four  people  in
          addition to  the use of both arms of each lifter to provide added
          upward thrust.

          Because of the peculiar light  weight  sensation  we experienced,
          several of us concocted a way to conclusively "prove"  a  loss of
          weight.  It  was  to  involve  a  plywood panel lying on top of a
          scale or counterbalanced in such  a way as to allow us to monitor
          the actual weight of the entire process.

          A chair  was  to be placed on the plywood with a  suitably  heavy
          subject.  Each  of  the  4  lifters  would  then stand around the
          subject and the entire setup weighed.   This  would  provide  our
          base reference weight.

          The experiment would then be monitored at each of the stages.  If
          there was something else going on that involved an actual loss of
          weight, it could be a remarkably simple way to prove it.  We will
          probably do this experiment someday to see what  happens,  but if
          you should  choose  to  do it, please share your findings.  Also,
          try it with different people and  subjects  of different weights,
          just in case there is some kind of "balance" that  must  occur to
          get the  optimum lift.  I mention this because sometimes it works
          EXTREMELY well and other times, it is not so remarkable.
