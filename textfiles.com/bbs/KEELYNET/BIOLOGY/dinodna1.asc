                        CELLS OF DINOSAUR APPARENTLY FOUND

                          Scientists Believe Blood Cells
                             in Tyrannosaurus Rex May
                               Lead to Traces of DNA

                               By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

       A Montana paleontologist  and his colleagues believe they have found
       red blood cells in the fossilized  leg  bone  of a Tyrannosaurus Rex
       and say they have high hopes of extracting DNA from  the  dinosaur's
       cells.

       The discovery of the putative dinosaur blood cells has not yet been
       submitted to a scientific journal or independently confirmed but was
       reported two weeks ago by the National Science Foundation, which has
       financed the exploratory  project.  Jack Horner, a paleontologist at
       Montana State University who directed  the investigation, said in an
       interview yesterday that  his  group hoped to find  matches  between
       gene fragments left in the preserved blood cells with comparable DNA
       segments from modern crocodiles or birds.

       "If we're lucky  enough  to find matches," he said, "they could go a
       long way toward showing what the relationship  between dinosaurs and
       birds might be.   We're  not there yet, but we think  we're  getting
       close."

       The femur, or  leg bone, that Mr. Horner's group is studying is part
       of an unusually  well-preserved tyrannosaur  fossil,  more  than  65
       million years old,  which  they found and excavated  from  the  Hell
       Creek Formation in  eastern  Montana  three years ago.  The apparent
       blood cells were  discovered  by   Mary   Schweitzer,  Mr.  Horner's
       graduate student who  was  investigating  the  cell   structure   of
       fossilized bone and marrow tissue.

                               New Climate of Belief

       In the past,  few  paleontologists  or molecular biologists believed
       that biological material could survive for millions of years without
       becoming mineralized, thus losing  its  organic molecular structure.
       The survival of any intact DNA, which ordinarily decays  with  time,
       seemed even less  likely.   But  the  recent  discovery  of  organic
       material and even  fragments of DNA  in  ancient  plant  and  animal
       fossils has changed opinions.

       "Two years ago I would have called this baloney," said  Dr.  Raul J.
       Cano of California  Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo,
       a molecular biologist who has himself  extracted  DNA fragments from
       fossilized insects and plants millions of years old.

       Told of Mr.  Horner's  belief that blood cells have  survived  in  a
       tyrannosaur bone -  and that they may contain dinosaur DNA fragments
       - Dr. Cano said: "It's certainly  plausible.   We  have seen similar
       things ourselves, and there are reports from other  investigators of
       the finding of  surviving biological material inside fossil dinosaur
       bones, especially in  the  deep  bone  cortex,  which  seems  to  be
       somewhat protected from mineralization."

       Earlier this month,  Dr.  Cano and his associates  reported  in  the
       British journal Nature  that  they  had  extracted DNA from a weevil
       that had been entombed in amber  for  120  million  to  135  million
       years.

                            Doubter Grants Possibility

       A molecular biologist who has strongly questioned the premise that
       appreciable quantities of DNA could survive for very long periods is
       Dr. Russell Higuchi  of Roche Molecular Systems in  Alameda,  Calif.
       But Dr. Higuchi  said  yesterday  that  it  seemed possible that Mr.
       Horner's group, had actually seen dinosaur blood cells.

       Although Dr. Higuchi said he remained doubtful about the survival of
       dinosaur DNA, particularly in a fossil  that was probably exposed to
       water, "we ourselves speculated 10 years ago that  if  dinosaur  DNA
       survived at all, it might be found" deep inside a fossil bone.

       Mr. Horner said that microscopic examination of a thin slice through
       the dinosaur bone  revealed  that  although  its  outer  layers were
       mineralized the bone itself, brown  in  color, remained more or less
       intact in the interior of the marrow cavity.

       "Mary found spherical  structures  that appear to be  nucleated  red
       cells inside the blood vessels running through the bone, right where
       you'd expect to  find  blood,  if it's there," he said.  "Since then
       we've been trying everything we can  think  of  to show that they're
       not blood cells, but they still seem to be the real thing."

                              Fears of Contamination

       Part of the  science foundation's grant to Mr. Horner's  group  went
       for laboratory equipment  to  conduct a polymerase chain reaction, a
       technique that can single out a lone  molecular  fragment of DNA and
       make enough copies so it can be analyzed using standard methods.


                                      Page 2





       "The biggest problem  is contamination of the fossil by foreign DNA,
       "Mr., Horner said.  "There's lots  of it there, The real trick is in
       identifying something that is not a contaminant.  This is why we are
       looking for matches  with  crocodile  DNA, which  is  not  a  likely
       contaminant."

       Mr. Horner says  he  is  certain  that at least some original tissue
       remains in the fossil because his  group  has  positively identified
       collagen in the bone.  Collagen is a fibrous protein  found  in  the
       connective tissue of animals, which ordinarily decays rapidly except
       under special circumstances.

       Cheryl Dybas, a  spokeswoman  for  the  National Science Foundation,
       acknowledged that her agency had intentionally  released  its report
       of Mr. Horner's progress to coincide with the opening  of  "Jurassic
       Park," a science  fiction  movie based on the premise that dinosaurs
       might one day be cloned from their surviving DNA.

       "We thought it would be a good opportunity  to get the word out on 4
       of the 10  dinosaur  research projects the N.S.F.  is  funding  this
       year, including that of Mr. Horner," Ms. Dybas said.
