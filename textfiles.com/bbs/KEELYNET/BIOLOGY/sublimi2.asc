       This is an early article in the field of subliminal suggestion.

       Modern research questions the validity of subliminals although there
       is a profusion  of subliminal tapes.  Sleep learning takes advantage
       of this because the subconscious  records  everything  even when the
       conscious mind is asleep.

       My father used to have a phonograph with many switches  on  the face
       of a clock.   It  was part of a system that included records to help
       the user overcome various problems  or  induce  specific  habits.  A
       record with the desired suggestions was placed on the  turntable and
       the timer was  set  to  play  the record when the user was sleeping,
       somewhere around 2 AM.  The user  could  also  set  it  for multiple
       events of the same recording to further reinforce the process.

       It is illegal to broadcast subliminal images on TV, radio or movies,
       although subliminals are frequently used in visual printed ads.

       Now ad men  have  a  new  way  to  persuade  you.  They  can  pop  a
       suggestion into your  mind, using TV or movies, without your knowing
       it.
                                  TV's New Trick:
                                Hidden Commercials
                               By Wesley S. Griswold

       Probably you've heard  about  -   perhaps   even   worried  about  a
       revolutionary new way  to  beam  messages  into  the   human   mind.
       Especially suited to TV and movies, the new idea-injecting technique
       is said to work while you, all unawares, are innocently enjoying the
       program.  The idea-words  appear  superimposed on the picture images
       too fast and too dimly to be seen  in  the  normal  way.   Yet  they
       register on your mind.

       Despite rejection by the national networks, uneasy skepticism by the
       F.C.C. and alarm from people who fear that this strange  development
       may bring wholesale  invasion  of  privacy  and  risk  of  political
       tyranny, two means  of  reaching   people's  subconscious  minds  by
       television are currently being tested.

       This month one of them, called Precon TV, was scheduled  to be tried
       out on a  large  audience  of TV watchers in and around Los Angeles.
       It was to have been Precon TV's  first  big  showing.   It's  rival,
       Subliminal Projection, about which almost no technical  details have
       been released, has already ventured on the air in Bangor, Me., and

                                      Page 1




       on a Canadian  national  hookup.  Results for Subliminal Projection:
       inconclusive.

       For its debut on independent Station KTLA, Precon TV did not plan
       to use advertising.  Instead,  public-service  messages-like  "Drive
       Safely,"  "Support Your Community Chest," or "Don't be a Litterbug,"
       -  were to be tucked away into the telecast picture.

       But after this plan was announced, so much public criticism  of  the
       new technique boiled  up  that the trial was postponed.  Controversy
       over these idea-injecting systems has swirled around three issues:

                   (1) Are they legally proper?
                   (2) Are they ethically acceptable?
                   (3) And do they really work at all?

       Precon TV has a long history behind  it.  (The trade name comes from
       the work "preconscious,"  meaning  "below  the  level  of  conscious
       awareness."  "Subliminal" means the same thing.)

       Its inventors, Dr.  Robert  E. Corrigan of Los Angeles and Prof. Hal
       C. Becker of New Orleans, both men  now  in their mid-thirties, have
       been testing the theories and working parts of Precon  for  the past
       eight years.  Patents  were  applied for early in 1955, but have not
       yet been issued.   Consequently,   the  inventors  decline  to  tell
       everything about their  creation,  though  they  have  revealed  the
       essentials.

       The basic equipment, the means of sprinkling televison programs with
       invisible but receivable  messages,  is  contained  in a rectangular
       metal box about half the size of a  standard  table-top TV set.  Its
       power unit, in  a separate, much smaller container,  runs  on  house
       current.

       This equipment is  a  kind  of electronic mixing bowl, where printed
       information can be subtly stirred in with pictures.  Inside the main
       Precon TV cabinet,  along  with   17   vacuum   tubes  and  a  photo
       multiplier, is a little flying spot scanner and,  in  front  of  its
       round face, a  small  frame for holding the text to be scanned.  The
       text is printed on a transparent plastic  slide,  on a three-by-four
       inch space.

       Picture signals from image-orthicon tubes in studio  cameras focused
       on live performances,  or  from iconoscopes recording filmed scenes,
       are piped into the Precon TV apparatus on their way to the station's
       antenna.

       To understand what happens to them  in  the Precon blender, remember
       that it takes  one-thirtieth of a second for a cathode-ray  tube  to
       project one complete  picture  image on a televison screen.  In that
       time it has  to scan the picture  twice,  each  perusal  taking  one
       sixtieth of a second.

       Inside the Precon  TV  cabinet,  with  the aid of the  pulsed  light
       emitted by the  flying  spot  scanner, the printed message is super-
       imposed on the incoming picture signals  every other one-sixtieth of
       a second.  (The rate of mixture can be varied, as can  the intensity
       of the pulsed light, which normally is less than one-third as bright
       as that of  the  picture  signals.)   The well-mixed video brew then
       flows on to the station's antenna, to which the program's sound

                                      Page 2




       signals, not involved in Precon TV, proceed independently.

       Prof. Becker, an  electronics  engineer  and  physicist  who teaches
       experimental neurology at   Tulane    University,   points   out   a
       fascinating quirk:

              When you suspect you're watching a Precon  program,  you  can
              find out  what the hidden message is by spreading the fingers
              of one hand and moving them  rapidly  up and down in in front
              of your  eyes.  By varying the rate of this movement,  you'll
              soon find  and  match the rate at which the Precon message is
              being pulsed.  Then you'll be able to read it.

       "The two questions we are most often  asked  about Precon," said Dr.
       Corrigan, a former fighter pilot who is now a psychologist  for  the
       Douglas Aircraft Co.,"  are 'How do you know that it works?' and 'Is
       it dangerous?'

          "We have found ample proof that  it  works,"  he  continued,  "in
           exhaustive experiments at Tulane University that  we  have  been
           conducting since  1950.  In the course of finding that proof, we
           also became convinced that the Precon technique of communication
           can't be dangerous.  There is  no possibility of brainwashing by
           Precon, for  each man is his own censor.  His preconscious  mind
           responds to  Precon  messages  in complete accord with his likes
           and dislikes.  There is no better  chance  of  putting something
           over on his preconscious mind than there is of  hoodwinking  his
           conscious mind."

       Corrigan and Becker discovered people's built-in censorship in tests
       in which three  different types of words were very rapidly projected
       on a screen.  Some of the words were  neutral-like  "stove," "table"
       and "rug."  Some  had emotional impact - "scream," "blood,"  "hate."
       Others were obscene words.

       In repeated trials,  the speed at which each word was flashed on the
       screen was slowed until the person  being  tested  could say that he
       definitely had seen  it.  The researchers found that  the  emotional
       and obscene words had to be shown two or three times slower than the
       neutral words before  people  watching  the  screen  could recognize
       them.  Corrigan and Becker took  this  as  firm  evidence  that  the
       people were resisting and censoring upsetting words.

       Next,in addition to calling out when they could identify  a  word  ,
       the subjects were asked to press a little lever as well. It was then
       discovered that not  only  did  they push the lever sooner than they
       reported seeing the  word - thus proving   pre-conscious  perception
       -but they reacted  preconsciously  to  emotional and  obscene  words
       precisely as they  did  when conscious of them.  They were censoring
       them without being aware of it.

       Further tests showed,  they  contend,  that  people  can  be  taught
       preconsciously.   Corrigan and  Becker  arranged   to   give   their
       subjects tiny electric  shocks  whenever  certain neutral words were
       flashed on the screen.  Then the shocks  were  stopped, but when the
       words that had  been  associated  with  them  appeared   again,  the
       subjects reacted to  them  preconsciously  if they were words highly
       charged with emotion.  They had learned,  without  realizing  it  to
       attribute a new and painful meaning to harmless words.


                                      Page 3




       The Precon developers  gave  groups  of  people  jumbled  letters to
       rearrange into actual words.   Before  the  test  began, they showed
       the answers on  a screen, too fast for anyone in the  room  to  see.
       Preconsciously they were   seen,   however,  and  comparative  tests
       indicated that the subjects solved  the  puzzles  15  to 46 per cent
       faster when the  answers  had  been  slipped to their  sub-conscious
       minds in advance.

       Finally Corrigan and  Becker  expanded their experiments to theater-
       size audiences.  They showed movies  -  color  cartoons  -  in which
       printed information was hidden from conscious view.   In  one  case,
       geometric symbols - a triangle, a circle and a square-were used.  In
       the other, gasoline  trade names were used.  After the audiences had
       seen the films, they were asked to  tell  whether  they  liked, felt
       indifferent to, or disliked each movie.

       They were then shown the symbols and the trade names  and  asked  to
       give their reactions  to  them.   The results suggested that the way
       people had reacted to the symbols and trade names influenced the way
       they reacted to  the  movies. If they  felt  "positive"  toward  the
       preconscious information, they  liked  the  movie;   if   they  felt
       "negative" about the information, they objected to the movie.

       The Precon inventors  feel  this  point,  then, is amply proved: Our
       preconscious likes and dislikes are  the same as our conscious ones.
       Nobody, they contend, is going to convince us by  Precon  TV  to buy
       something we don't want to buy, or do something we don't want to do.

       Corrigan and Becker  began  their  experiments with Precon apparatus
       with the thought that the technique  would  be wonderfully useful in
       education (training films)   and   psycho-therapy    (reaching   the
       consciously withdrawn patient  by  tapping him on the subconscious).
       They still are ardently convinced of this.

       The commercial possibilities occurred  to  them  later.  Already the
       inventors, through the  newly  created  Precon Process  &  Equipment
       Corp. of New  Orleans, have marketed a counter top or window display
       electrical device for flashing Precon  advertising  at passersby who
       think they are  merely  looking  at an attractive illuminated  color
       photograph.  There is  a  strong  likelihood that there'll be Precon
       movies, too.

       Dr. Corrigan is convinced that if  emotion charged words suitable to
       the action of  a  movie  are  included  in  the  film  but  are  not
       consciously visible to  its audience, the movie will gain in impact.
       Prof. Becker says the trick can  be  turned  by  super-imposing  the
       words on a master print of the film, but that a better  way would be
       to synchronize a  special  Precon  movie projector with each theater
       projector.  A leading motion-picture  studio has indicated seriously
       that it would  like to be shown how a Precon movie  could  be  made.
       And a wag has already suggested what to call it - a "feelie."
