                                 Tons of Goldfish

       I read the  letter  from  Helen  L.  McGill  with  a  great  deal of
       interest.  It was the first I had  learned of farmer's ponds seeding
       themselves with fish.   True, I had heard of individual  cases  here
       and there, but I did not know that it was general.

       Her explanation of  the phenomenon is novel, to say the least.  I am
       curious as to how birds carry spawn  on  bits of water plant or moss
       or on their feet.  A bit of water plant conceivably  might adhere to
       a bird's foot  for  a while, but in sustained flight I fear it would
       dry and get blown off.  Fish eggs out of water do not last long.  If
       birds are doing this seeding it would  seem that game commission men
       would be aware of it.

       Orogrande, New Mexico,  in 1941 or 1942, was the scene  of  a  fish-
       seeding incident.  A  real heller of a rain filled up a low place in
       the desert, forming a large lake.   Within  a  short time, too short
       for natural development, goldfish, some eight inches  in length were
       found in the water.  Not juse a few; tons of them.

       Goldfish-fry parties were  commonl  until the lake dried up.  As the
       water lowered, farmers came with tanks and barrels, hauling the fish
       to their own tanks.  Tons of dead  fish still remained when the lake
       finally dried up.

       Nevertheless, I was  please  to  see  Helen's  letter.    If  enough
       interest is generated, we might learn something yet.  I am not quite
       ready to accept  the theory that where conditions are favorable life
       will occur spontaneously.

       Waite's Lake some 50 miles north of  Spokane,  Washington, has a bit
       of a mystery.  The lake has no outlet, was never  planted  -  but is
       populated with salmon.          Jim Fortner, Long Beach, California

       Vangard note....

            Spontaneous Generation is supposed to have been disproved under
            laboratory conditions.   In  a  natural  environment, there are
            many factors which could produce such rapid growth.

            There are still some interesting arguments for and against the

                                      Page 1





            case of   spontaneous  generation.   One  is  that  of  Antoine
            Bechamp, a  contemporary  of  Pasteur  and  the  discoverer  of
            MICROZYMAS.  As a matter of fact, Pasteur was  a  proponent  of
            the theory of spontaneous generation.

            Bechamp's work  is much too extensive to cover in this paper so
            a simple description will be  included.   He discovered so many
            things and carried out such original research that a full paper
            would serve our readers well.

            The term  Microbes  is the modern equivalent  of  the  original
            MicroZymas.  These   were  found  to  be  present  in  abundant
            quantities in the air as well as in water and earth.

            Microzymas are  physiologically  imperishable.   They  are  not
            germs of the air nor are the pre-existent in the  air, they are
            the LIVING REMAINS of organisms which have disappeared and been
            destroyed.

            After all  natural  organic matters, their tissues and cellules
            are reduced to their mineral  form, there still remain only the
            Microzymas.  They  are  the  agents of the changes  which  take
            place in living tissues through pleomorphic reorganizations.

            In other  words,  they  can  "project"  themselves  into higher
            orders of being from the initial  seed patterns inherent in the
            Microzyma.  Bechamp goes on to find that these  Microzymas  can
            become corrupted to the point of inflicting disease in the host
            body to the point of death.

            The point is that Microzymas of all dead beings are omnipresent
            in nature.   We are continually exposed to them and susceptible
            the their influence once they  are  given the proper conditions
            to awaken and exert their influence.

            To that extent, the appearance of the fish in  the newly formed
            lakes in a very low area of land might be because at one point,
            that area was a lake or part of a larger body of water.  If so,
            then the   concentration   of  Microzymas  in  the  area  would
            necessarily be extremely high,  accounting for the abundance of
            the fish and the speed of their appearance.
