       This text is  a  commentary  on psychotronic or psionic devices used
       for mind control,  for the purpose  of  subjugating  individuals  or
       segments of a population.

       It is hoped  that  through  this  discussion,  anyone  with  further
       knowledge of the technology involved will come forward and add their
       information in order  to  fit all the pieces of the puzzle together,
       and hopefully find a source of relief for those persons affected.

       This would include speculative details  of  the devices in question,
       as well as input for the construction of counter-measure devices.

       A brief history  is  in  order.  The  evolution  of   these  devices
       essentially begins with a device developed in the Soviet Union knowm
       as LIDA. Using  a  carrier  of  approximately  40  MHZ, the LIDA was
       originally designed as a therapeutic device.

       Then the military  began  to exploit  the  device  for  its  obvious
       usefulness as a means of interrogating prisoners of war.

       This had application in the Korean war and was used  by North Korea,
       although it has been denied.  Additional evidence suggests that this
       device, or one similar, was used by North Vietnam during the Vietnam
       conflict.

       For the most  part,  this  brings us to the present day. It has been
       brought to light  in  various  publications  (see  bibliography  and
       sources) that new versions of LIDA based on scalar  technology  have
       been developed and  have  been tested on the American public by such
       organizations as the NSA and CIA as well as by private researchers.

       There is an  organization in Cuyahoga  Falls,  Ohio  called  Thought
       Watch whose established  function  is  to  disseminate   information
       regarding mind control  experiments  and  to  gather  testimony from
       people who believe that they have been affected by this technology.

       Additionally it collects information regarding the technical aspects
       of the devices outlined here. Contact information is included at the
       end of this document.
