The following is a wonderful piece of work that we are honored to distribute.
For those who might not be familiar with the work of Royal Rife, I suggest you
download RIFE1, RIFE2, RIFE3 and RIFEFREQ.  The files will provide you with
sufficient information to form your own opinions and any experiments or
actions you take after reading them, you do SOLELY at your own risk.

KeelyNet, Vanguard Sciences, it's Sysops and Associates are in no way
responsible for ANY actions YOU might CHOOSE to take after reading any material
on KeelyNet.

Ok, now that's out of the way.

The BLASTER5 program was created and tested for the express purpose of
offering a simple way for everyone to use the RIFE technology.  It was written
by a KeelyNet Associate who wishes to remain anonymous and we are grateful for
his efforts and willingness to share his work and experimental results.

You understand how resonance can shatter a glass?  Well, the same principle
applies to mass, including living tissue and organs.  Tune to that mass
aggregate resonance and project an amplified signal and you can blow it up.

You don't believe it?  I have seen video tape (which we will try to set up in
future as an animation file) of paramecia being 'exploded' by purely sonic
frequencies.  At their resonant peaks, the critters stop and vibrate.  As the
amplitude of the signal is increased, they begin to swell and flatten until
their outer membrane pops, spilling all the guts.  From that point, believe
it, they are dead.

Further research claims to have found certain CONDITIONS to also be responsive
to specific aggregate resonances.  For a better understanding of the
principles involved, I suggest you also read NEUTRAL1.ASC on KeelyNet, with
particular attention to the concept of the neutral center AND the tetractys.

This is the way the BLASTER5 program was used.

  1.  Open your computer case and disconnect the SPEAKER wires.
  2.  Get an RCA audio jack, drill a hole in the rear of your computer and
      mount it.
  3.  Attach the two computer wires to the audio jack.
  4.  Construct a pair of single wire electrodes, where one wire leads from
      each electrode to be joined in an audio jack
      (see electrode construction details at end of this file)
  5.  The computer speaker jack is connected by an audio cable to any audio
      amplifier (Radio Shack has several).  This is used to amplify the
      computer speaker signal.
  6.  The electrode wire (which drives TWO one wire electrodes) is connected
      to the output of the audio amplifier.

Public Domain Information Regarding Experimentation with Resonant Frequencies

  1. In general, the frequencies pass through the path of least resistance
     between the electrodes. This pathway may be:

     A.   Directly between the electrodes.
     B.   Along conductive paths such as acupuncture meridians.
     C.   Through conductive body fluids such as blood.
     D.   Through body tissue containing saline fluids.
     E.   Through the area directly under (touching) the electrodes.

  2. Experimentation, therefore, is a combination of knowledge of these
     pathways, as well as a good deal of common sense. ie: an organism
     circulating the blood would be best encountered at a place in which the
     blood circulates in large quantities. Many experimenters have tried using
     electrodes on such places as:

     A.   The feet, in order to resonate microbes that may reside
          in, or pass through the legs, feet and crotch area.
     B.   The arms, in order to resonate microbes that may reside
          in, or pass through the arms or chest area.
     C.   The buttocks, in order to resonate microbes that may
          reside in, or pass through the lower abdominal area.
     D.   The back, in order to resonate microbes that may reside
          in, or pass through the chest area.
     E.   Directly on surface lesions, in order to resonate
          microbes residing in the infected area.
     F.   On either side of the neck, or throat, in order to
          resonate microbes residing in the throat or neck area.
     G.   On both cheeks, in order to resonate microbes residing in
          the mouth area.
     H.   On either side of the stomach, in order to resonate
          microbes in the stomach and intestine area.
     I.   On either side of the nose, in order to resonate microbes
          in the sinus area.
     J.   One electrode wire split off to two electrodes on the
          arms, and one electrode wire split off to two electrodes
          on the feet, in order to resonate microbes residing below
          the neck.
     K.   Lying down on two long electrodes that are side-by-side,
          separated by an insulator of duct tape or similar
          material.

  3. Several application methods have been tried using stainless steel
     electrodes, such as:

     A.   Electrodes bare against the skin.
     B.   Electrodes covered with separate washcloths damp with
          epsom salt water.
     C.   Electrodes covered with separate sponges damp with epsom
          salt water.
     D.   Electrodes submerged in separate pans of warm epsom salt
          water.
     E.   Use of a large and a small electrode, for concentrating
          the frequency at the site of the smaller of the two
          electrodes.

  4. Several timetables have been used by experimenters in various
     circumstances, including:

     A.   5 minutes per frequency, with several or all suspect
          frequencies being used.
     B.   Several frequency applications per day in the case of
          microorganisms that would normally "run their course" die
          out in several weeks or less on their own.
     C.   3 to 5 minutes per frequency once every third day for 60-
          90 days on microorganisms that will not die out on their
          own.

  5. Several general sources of information that may be helpful are:

     A.   John F. Crane's Polarity Research Manual.*
     B.   Any acupuncture books with meridian charts.
     C.   Any literature regarding electrode placement of galvanic
          stimulators.

IMPORTANT NOTES AND CONSIDERATIONS:

If damp cloths or sponges are to be used with the electrodes, take care to use
separate cloths, for each electrode. If this is not done, and one cloth is
placed over both electrodes, the frequency will pass directly from one
electrode to the other through the damp cloth or sponge, and bypass entirely
the tissue that is the intended target of the frequency.

This same principle applies when using pans of epsom salt water. Do not place
both electrodes in the same pan of salt water. If both electrodes are placed
in the same pan of salt water, you are shorting the electrodes through the
epsom salt water, and the frequency will pass through the water, and not
through the intended tissue.

Do not touch the metal electrodes together while the frequency is turned on,
or you risk damaging your equipment.

Many experimenters do not realize that it may take 60 to 90 days to reach most
or all of the targeted microorganisms with an experimental electrode system.

Electrode Construction Details

  Estimated size of each electrode is 4" X 5"
  You will need to construct two of these electrodes.

  Buy about one yard of soft terry cloth fabric.

  Buy a couple of strips of velcro fastener material to seal the terry cloth
  pouch that you will sew.

  Buy two CELLULOSE sponge pads PER ELECTRODE (4 total), about 1/4 to 1/2 inch
  thick.  Don't use artificial sponges as they are not sufficiently
  conductive.

  You can use sheet metal, aluminum or stainless steel sheets for the
  conductive plates that go on the inside of the terry cloth electrodes.

  Cut the terry cloth and sew into a flat pouch, open on one end.

  Solder a single insulated stranded wire to a metal plate, sandwich the plate
  between the two cellulose sponges and insert into the pouch.

  Attach velcro so that the pouch can be closed.

  The other end of the wire connects to one leg of the audio jack (one
  electrode wire per audio jack leg) that plugs into the output of the audio
  amplifier.  The audio jack will have two legs, one leg for each of the two
  speaker wires.

  To use, dip in an epsom salt/water solution and lightly wring out.  These
  electrodes are then placed on either side of the area to be zapped.

You can run the program just by typing BLASTER5.

If you choose to modify your computer to run the program PROPERLY, then do the
very simple mod to the computer, construct your electrodes, hook'em up and run
BLASTER5.

The duration of the applied frequencies has been found to work best when set
at 5 minutes in most cases.  You are expected to set the duration.

You will note, in many cases there are multiple frequencies that are being
applied in sequence during the chosen duration time.

We would greatly appreciate your reports of any problems or successes you
might have should you choose to decide to experiment with this system.
