                      The Orgone Energy of Dr. Wilhelm Reich

       The concept of  Orgone Energy evolved from a simple question.  Reich
       noted that living organisms were  able  to  release MORE energy than
       they take up in their food.  The essence of the problem  was  almost
       solved towards the late 1930's.

       The Orgone Box  which  Reich  devised and constructed consisted of a
       small box covered  on  all  sides   by  an  electrically  conductive
       material, in this  case  aluminum  foil.   Under   that   foil  were
       successive layers of  organic and inorganic materials.  (metal, then
       cotton/moss/wool/wood (anything organic)  followed  again  by  metal
       foil in as many layers as you wish)

       The number of layers in addition to the size of the  box  determines
       the amount of orgone energy which will be accumulated.

       Although the container  could  be placed in any location and be in a
       light or dark area, the air was  found  to  become  about  4 degrees
       Centigrade warmer than  the  surrounding  room  temperature.   (this
       translates to about 12 degrees Fahrenheit)

       Reich based the  design  of  his  Orgone  Box on the cell of a human
       organism.  It was represented by a  housing  covered on all sides by
       an electrically charged membrane with double contortions.

       It is interesting  to  note  that  the  phenomenon   of   "malignant
       hyperthermia" (spontaneous combustion  in  its  worst form) can also
       result in a  temperature  increase   to   as   high  as  43  degrees
       Centigrade.  It can  further  lead to cramps and contractions  which
       can threaten life.   Attempts  at cooling the person by ingestion of
       large volumes of iced water only  result  in  heating the water from
       the excess body temperature.

       The parallel of the increase in temperature of the  Orgone  Box  and
       the heating of   the   body   through  this  hyperthermia  is  quite
       fascinating.  Persons suffering from this symptom have been found to
       have VERY HIGH CALCIUM CONCENTRATIONS in the cell membranes.

       This indicates a possible means of  IMPROVING  THE EFFICIENCY of the
       Orgone Box by using a calcium coated layer.

       research, Dr. Reich wrote a letter to Albert Einstein in December of
       1940.  Einstein agreed  to consult with Reich which ended up lasting
       almost five hours.  As Reich discussed  the temperature differential
       surrounding his Orgone  Box, Einstein told him that  if  the  effect
       could be reproduced, it would represent "a bomb in physics."

       Later, Reich left  an Orgone Accumlator with Einstein for study.  It
       was set up in the basement and two  thermometers  clearly showed the
       temperature differential.

       One thermometer was located in a tube directly ABOVE the Orgone Box,
       the other one was freely suspended about one meter  away.   Einstein
       had to agree  to  the  correctness of Reich's observations.  He then
       exchanged the two  thermometers   and   the   OBSERVED  DIFFERENTIAL
       remained the same (about 4 degrees Centigrade).

       Reich later developed  an  Orgone  Motor based on the  principle  of
       coupling a small  excitor  dynamo  having 0.5 voltage power, with an
       orgone energy accumulator  of  a  special  design.   This  prototype
       supplied a 25 volt motor with a PERMANENT ENERGY SUPPLY.

       In March 1954, Reich was officially requested to stop any additional
       research in the  area  of  Orgone  Energy  and  to suspend  all  his
       publications on the  subject.   Three  years later, Reich died in an
       American prison.  His books and writings were confiscated and burned
       on order of the U.S. government.

       From what we know of thermodynamics  today,  the  Reich  temperature
       differential would provide  more  than sufficient power  to  operate
       devices which could easily lead to generation of electricity or as a
       motive power.
