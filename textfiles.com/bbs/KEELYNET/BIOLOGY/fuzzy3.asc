     The contents of the following article are at present undocumented
    rumors which have been spoken of in various conversations with our
        KeelyNet and Vangard Sciences contributors and consultants.

                          Rumor about new weapon?

    A Mr. Cunningham,  who  lived  in Canada built two weapons using a
    new principle.  He made a statement  that  he could destroy Mexico
    City from Canada  with one shot.  The Israelis are  said  to  have
    bought one and used it most successfully in the 6 day war.

                       Parting of Cells without pain

    Linda Howe described  some  cattle  mutilations  as having a shear
    vertical wall as if done with a laser.  In addition, there is
    very little blood remaining in the animal.

    Psychic healers seem to be able to vibrate the cells apart so that
    no rupture occurs to release the  acid/alkali  fluids  in the cell
    interior.  This release of intra-cellular fluid is what causes the
    sensation of pain.

    The science fiction show Dr. Who uses a vibrating  (sonic?)  knife
    which is intended to work by separting cells without cutting.


                       Look for new book, "Genesis"

    Peter Kelly, of  Interdimensional  Sciences,  told  us in a recent
    conversation to be on the lookout  for  a  science fiction book of
    about 500 pages.

    It is said to contain information regarding Alternative 3, various
    genetic experiments, Tom  Bearden  and  his  Scalar  Technologies,
    secret UFO experiments,  a  secret colony at the poles and several
    other strange relationships.

    We are instructed to buy as many copies as we can get our hands on
    and pass the info to our network.

    The book, "Genesis" was published  by  Harbinger in 1982 and gives
    an extensive bibliography.  (IN A SCIENCE FICTION NOVEL??)

    It is said that the book has been ordered removed from the shelves
    due to the content.

    To date (2/25/90), one of our people has found a  single copy at a
    major chain while  another found 3 copies at a half-price store on
    Preston.





    We will keep  you  informed if we find a source.  The word is that
    the book is excellent and contains  much true information of which
    we should be  aware.   Due  to  the  nature of the  book,  it  was
    possibly written as science fiction to get it past the editors.
