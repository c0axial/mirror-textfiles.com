                        Biomagnetics:  The Magnetic Answer
                           By William H. Philpott, M.D.

         The Value of Using Negative Magnetic Energy in Diabetes Mellitus
                   (Contains some professional-level material.)

          Central to the non-insulin dependent diabetic (Type  II diabetes)
       is insulin resistance.   Over  the  past twenty years, I have tested
       several thousand patients for disordered  carbohydrate metabolism in
       relationship to single-food test meals.  Several  hundred  of  these
       were also tested  for  insulin  response  to  single-food test meals
       which were also correlated with the degree of carbohydrate disorder.

          The primary diagnosis of these  patients  was  a wide spectrum of
       physical and mental  disorders, including several hundred  maturity-
       onset diabetes cases and a few insulin dependent juvenile diabetics.
       From these studies,   solid   evidence   emerged  that  the  insulin
       resistance of Type II non-insulin  dependent  diabetes  mellitus  is
       produced by maladaptive reactions largely to foods  and, to a lesser
       extent, common environmental chemicals.

          There is a routine clearance of insulin resistance as well as the
       carbohydrate disorder by  avoidance  of  the  foods  and  substances
       evoking the maladaptive reactions, which consist of an array of

                                      Page 1





       physical and emotional  symptoms as well as higher-than-normal blood
       sugar response.

          The carbohydrate disorder, of  brief  duration,  and  the chronic
       carbohydrate disorders justifying the diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus
       Type II behave  alike.   Therefore,  it is concluded  that  Diabetes
       Mellitus Type II is simply an extension of these lesser carbohydrate
       disorders.  Both are   readily   reversed   by   avoidance   of  the
       maladaptive reactive substance.   Thus,  initial  avoidance (usually
       three months) and  later  spacing  by  rotation  with   a  frequency
       (usually of four   days  or  more)  the  symptoms  and  carbohydrate
       reaction, both the minor and major  carbohydrate  disorders  and the
       insulin resistance, is initially corrected and remains corrected.

          Unfortunately, there is a low level of awareness  of the ecologic
       causes of insulin  resistance  carbohydrate disorder.  The stress of
       obesity has been highlighted for its  significance since some 80% of
       diabetics at the  time  of  their  onset  are obese.   This  obesity
       certainly is a significant stress that could be corrected.  However,
       surprisingly, the insulin  resistance  and the carbohydrate disorder
       was corrected immediately by avoidance  and spacing before there was
       any time for weight reduction to have occurred.

          It is  a  strange  fact of scientific medicine that  this  is  so
       little known despite  the  fact  that a statistical verification has
       been published in the right place, that is, the Journal of Diabetes.
       For years, it has been the custom to consider the presence and level
       of hormones and enzymes to be the  producer of biological reactions,
       without any consideration of an energy source making  such reactions
       possible.  This belief   in   spontaneously   occurring   biological
       responses is no longer tenable now  that  we  understand the role of
       electromagnetics as the energy that governs biological responses.

          Specifically, it   is  the  energy  of  magnetism   which   makes
       biological responses possible.   For  years,  it  was  customary  to
       consider magnetism as one unit of  energy.   However,  it  has  been
       demonstrated conclusively that magnetism is two energies  THAT  HAVE
       OPPOSITE BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS  when  these energies are separated.  It
       is the balance between these two energies that governs metabolism.

          Magnetism is a push and pull system.   The  CLOCKWISE  spin  of a
       positive magnetic field PUSHES and the COUNTERCLOCKWISE  spin of the
       negative magnetic field  PULLS.   This  can  be  illustrated  by the
       energy of a moving object such as  a  car.   The  front end of a car
       pushes while the back end of a car pulls, yet the moving  car is one
       unit of energy, however, with two opposite effects.

          It also  should  be  understood that negative magnetic fields and
       positive magnetic fields are both  magnetic  energy with 180 degrees
       opposite response in biological systems.  Life energy is the balance
       between these two  systems.  An example is acid-base  balance.   The
       positive magnetic pole  is acidifying and the negative magnetic pole
       is alkalinizing in terms of biological  response  to single magnetic
       fields from a unipoled magnet.

          Biological life  has  a balance between acidity  and  alkalinity.
       There is evidence  that atheromatous plaques are the result of amino
       acids crosslinking sulphur and fatty  acid  bonds when the pH of the
       blood drops below normal.  There is clinical evidence justifying the

                                      Page 2





       conclusion that a negative magnetic field keeps the pH buffer system
       intact, thus preventing  crosslinking  and also that thecrosslinking
       can be reversed by a negative magnetic field.

          Another important issue is the  demonstrated  evidence  that  the
       positive magnetic pole  is  inflammatory- evoking and  the  negative
       magnetic pole is   anti-inflammatory   and  inflammatory  resolving.
       Understanding the oppositeness of biological responses evoked by the
       separate positive and  negative   magnetic   fields   is  critically
       important, because with  this  knowledge,  exposure  of  tissues  to
       single magnetic poles   can   provide   a   predictable,   governing
       capability over the  biological  responses  being  evoked  in  those
       tissues.

          It has  been  my  custom to routinely correlate  saliva  pH  with
       maladaptive reactions to  foods  and chemicals.  These reactions are
       routinely acid.  They  can  be controlled  by  a  negative  magnetic
       field.  Inflammation and an associated acidity can  be controlled by
       exposure to a  negative  magnetic  field.  How can we understand the
       cause of insulin resistance being caused by maladaptive reactions to
       foods, chemicals and inhalants?

       The formulation is on this order:

           these maladaptive   reactions,   whether   they   be   allergic,
           addictive, toxic   or   otherwise   unexplainable   inflammatory
           reactions, cause an inflammation edema of cells and whole tissue
           groups to occur.

           Insulins' assignment  is to carry blood glucose through the cell
           wall into the cell.  A cell and  its  membrane  that  is swollen
           cannot make proper use of insulin, thus the blood  sugar remains
           in the blood and is not transferred into the cell.

           When these cells or tissues are placed in a negative magnetic
           field, the  inflammatory edema is corrected and insulin works as
           it should.  Therefore, not only  should  we  use  avoidance  and
           spacing of  maladaptive  reacting substances,  but  also  tissue
           exposure to  negative magnetic field energy to make a correction
           of the insulin resistance in maturity-onset diabetes mellitus.

           Exposure to negative magnetic  field  energy ahead of a meal has
           been conclusively  demonstrated  as  materially   reducing   the
           chances of a maladaptive reaction to foods.

       Maladaptive reactions to    most    environmental   substances   are
       essentially the same process as maladaptive  reactions to foods.  If
       and when a  reaction  does  occur,  it can readily be  corrected  by
       placing those reactive  tissues  in  a  negative magnetic field. The
       inflammatory reactions occurring   due   to  the  diabetes  mellitus
       disease process reduce  oxygen  to  tissue,  encourage  invasion  of
       microorganisms (viruses, fungi  and  bacteria), produce inflammation
       of arteries with atheromatous plaque  buildup  and create many other
       tissue and nerve   degenerative   disease  processes   of   diabetes
       mellitus.

          However, the  most important thing we can understand is that this
       diabetes mellitus disease  process   exists   because  there  is  an
       imbalance between the positive and negative magnetic field energies

                                      Page 3





       where positive magnetic  energy has the ascendancy over the negative
       magnetic energy.  Direct tissue exposure to negative magnetic energy
       can do much to correct this magnetic energy imbalance disorder.

                                 DIAGNOSTIC FORMAT

          Testing blood sugar one hour after  meals  of single foods is the
       most important test.  Physical or mental symptoms are  also examined
       at the same  time.   Only  about  a  third of the foods that produce
       symptoms also produce a high blood sugar.  All maladaptive reactions
       are considered important and serve  as  indicators  of  the need for
       initial avoidance and  later  spacing  on  a  four-day,  diversified
       rotation basis.

          Before starting  deliberate  food  testing, it is necessary to go
       through five days of either fasting  or  preferably  the  infrequent
       eating of foods.   During  this  five day avoidance  period,  it  is
       important to be monitoring the saliva pH, and if the saliva pH drops
       below 6.4, then  it  is  important  to  take  sufficient soda bicarb
       frequently enough to keep the saliva  pH  at  about,  and preferably
       above, 6.4.

          It can also be helpful to provide during the first three days for
       intravenous Vitamin C  (12  .5  grams),  B-6 (100mg),  B-5  (200mg),
       Calcium (250mg) and Magnesium (250mg).

          It requires  a  month  of  four  meals  per day to go through the
       deliberate food testing.  It is well,  but  not always necessary, to
       have the usual classical examination for inhalants.   The  inhalants
       are not usually  highly significant.  It is largely the reactions to
       food that is significant.

          An insulin-dependent diabetic cannot  be  tested this way and the
       foods must be tested otherwise than by deliberate food tests.  It is
       significant to run  IgG  food tests and honor the  evidence  of  IgG
       allergic reactions to  foods.    It  should  be understood, however,
       that initial maturity-onset diabetics  become insulin dependent only
       after a long  period of degeneration.  Two-thirds  are  not  insulin
       dependent, even though they are taking insulin.

          This can  soon  be  discovered as a person tries the five days of
       avoidance.  Regular insulin can be  used  to cover the insulin needs
       when it is demonstrated that this is necessary. It  is  important to
       study the diabetic for nutritional disorders of vitamins, minerals,
       amino acids and  essential  fats.   Quantitative  studies  for these
       should be done.  It is also important  to  do functional studies for
       B-6 by the Tryptophan Loading Test and the EGPT.  Folic  Acid  needs
       should be examined   by  the  FIGLU  Test  and  B-12  needs  by  the
       Methylamalonic Acid spillage of the  urine.  It  can be demonstrated
       that there usually are enzyme disorders by studying assays for ESOD,
       MAO and lipid peroxide.

          This helps explain the persons weakness and reduced ability for
       processing toxins.  These tests also serve as a way to monitor
       improvement during treatment.  If there is any historical reason to
       examine for toxins, they should be examined for, especially spillage
       of lead in the urine. The infectious state should be assessed.  This
       especially includes viral infections, including Herpes Simplex,


                                      Page 4





       Epstein-Barr, Cytomegalo, HHV-6 and Coxsackie virus.  These can be
       examined for antibody levels to determine current activity.

          Candida should  be studied by culture from the vagina, the rectal
       area, the stool, the mouth as well  as  antibody  studies.  Both the
       citric acid cycle  and  urea  cycle  are  disordered   in   diabetes
       mellitus.  To test  for the rise in ammonia caused by the urea cycle
       disorder, it well to test both arterial  and venus ammonia two hours
       after an 80% protein stress meal.

                              DIABETES COMPLICATIONS

          It has  been  said that to understand diabetes is  to  understand
       disease.  Virtually any   metabolic   system   or   any   organ  can
       deteriorate with diabetes.  Micro-organism  infections  flourish  in
       diabetes.  Atherosclerotic development is accelerated  in  diabetes.
       Muscle waste (amyotrophia),   nerve  degeneration  (neuropathy)  and
       varied inflammatory reactions develop in diabetes.

          Negative magnetic energy can be  quite  valuable in treating many
       of the complications  of  diabetes  mellitus,  especially   such  as
       infections, pain, atherosclerosis, etc. An elderly man with gangrene
       of a foot  was  undergoing  EDTA  chelation which was not adequately
       handling this problem.  The gangrenous  foot  was so severe that the
       foot was scheduled to be surgically removed in one week.

          The negative  pole of a 4 X 6 X 1/2", 3950 guass  ceramic  magnet
       was placed twenty-four hours a day on the sole of the infected foot.
       Within one week,  the  improvement  was so substantial that the foot
       was not removed. An elderly, deteriorated diabetic man with diabetic
       neuropathy had severe burning pain  in  his  feet  for  which he had
       found no relief.  Each foot was placed on the negative  poles of a 4
       X 6 X 1/2", 3950 gauss ceramic magnetic.  In a few minutes, the pain
       left.  He remained  pain  free  for  several  hours.   When the pain
       returned, it was again relieved with  the  negative  magnetic field.
       Surprisingly, after a  few  days  of  treatment, the  pain  did  not
       return.

          At seventy,  a  man  with  atherosclerotic  heart  disease  had a
       multiple by-pass operation.   At   seventy-two,   his   heart   pain
       returned.  He was unsteady on his feet and would stumble, his speech
       was thick, he  would get lost in even familiar surroundings  and  he
       was chronically depressed.   At  seventy-four,  he  started magnetic
       therapy treatment by sleeping with  magnets at the crown of his head
       and a magnet over his heart during his waking hours.   When  seen  a
       week later, his  symptoms  had  disappeared.   At  one month, he was
       observed to have no pain in his heart,   steady  on his feet with no
       shuffling or stumbling,  speech  was  distinct,  he   was   smiling,
       socially assertive and there was no evidence of depression.

                                 TREATMENT FORMAT

          Of prime  importance is the initial avoidance of foods, chemicals
       and inhalants that evoke symptoms and/or disordered carbohydrate
       metabolism.  Minor reactive foods can be returned to the diet within
       six weeks and major reactors, as noted, usually within three months.

          Ninety-five percent of the foods  to  which  a  person  has  been
       demonstrated to be reactive can be returned to the diet on a once-

                                      Page 5





       in-four-day basis rotation  without  the  reoccurrence  of  symptoms
       and/or hyperglycemic reactions.   Interestingly  enough,  this  also
       includes free sugars.   The sugars need to be separated  into  their
       respective original sources  for  the  purpose  of  rotation such as
       corn, cane, beet,  maple and honey,  which  needs  to  be  separated
       according to where it was gathered.

          A person may react to a honey from their own locality  but not to
       a honey from  a  locality  away  from  where  they live.  It is also
       important that the honey not be heated.   The  digestive  enzymes in
       honey are observed  to  help  prevent  the maladaptive  inflammatory
       reaction.  It is  of  interest  to note that seldom does a maturity-
       onset diabetic react to maple sugar.

          It is  of  prime importance to  keep  the  excess  of  biological
       positive and the deficiency of negative magnetic energy  in balance.
       This is achieved  by  one-half  hour  exposure  to negative magnetic
       fields ahead of a meal, one hour before going to bed and exposure of
       the crown of the head while asleep,  and  by relieving symptoms when
       they occur.

          The atherosclerosis that develops in diabetes can  materially  be
       helped with negative magnetic energy.  There is substantial clinical
       evidence that atheromatous plaques are dissolved by prolonged (three
       to six months)  direct  exposure  to negative magnetic field energy.
       Furthermore, the pain of local hypoxia  due  to  atherosclerosis  is
       relieved by direct  exposure  of  the  painful area  to  a  negative
       magnetic field.  The mental confusion, disorientation and depression
       of cerebral atherosclerosis is remarkably reduced or even completely
       relieved by sleeping  at  night with negative magnetic energy at the
       top of the head.

          Neuropathy pains  in  the feet  can  be  remarkably  relieved  by
       placing the feet on the negative pole of a 3950 gauss,  4 X 6 X 1/2"
       ceramic magnet.  Gangrene  of  the  feet  has also been successfully
       reversed with this same magnet.  Infections  (fungal  and bacterial)
       are treated with twenty-four hour negative magnetic  field  exposure
       until the infection has disappeared.

                   junction of  skull  and neck.  It is well  to  reinforce
                   this with a round neodymium magnet placed in the center.
                   Alternatives are  to  use  cubes  bi-temporally  or  the
                   plastiform and neodymium on the forehead.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                   ONE HOUR IN THE EVENING BEFORE GOING TO BED:

       Use placement as described above  for  pre-meal  and  add a 3 x 24 x
       1/2" plastiform down the spine. A 2 x 1-3/8 x 1"  cube  on  anterior
       neck on each  side  of  larynx  can be held in place with an elastic
       bandage.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   During sleep:

       To initiate sleep, it is well to  use  a  2 x 5 x 1/2" magnet on the
       sternum.

       Four 4 x 6 x 1/2" magnets in a carrier holding the  magnets  upright
       one inch apart within three inches of the top of the head.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  During the day:

       Wear a 2x3x1/8" plastiform over the heart (left shirt pocket or left
       bra cup).  Do not use with a pacemaker.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   For Symptoms:

       Use appropriate magnet over the symptom and with sufficient duration
       and frequency to   reduce  symptom,  such  as  pain,  inflam-mation,
       infection, edema, etc.

                MAGNETIC POLARITY DEFINITIONS USED IN THIS ARTICLE

       This is to avoid the semantic confusion  when referring to north and
       south poles.

       Negative magnetic polarity energy:

              This is  identified  either  as  the side of  a  flat-surface
              magnet with  poles  on  opposite sides or as the end of a bar
              magnet that registers negative  (-)  on a magnetometer.  This
              is also the same energy as the true physical  north  magnetic
              pole of the earth.

              This is  opposite  to  the  north  seeking  pole of a compass
              needle, which was originally  wrongly named north pole, when,
              in fact,  the  north  seeking pole of a bar  magnet  (compass
              needle) is south pole, since opposites attract.

       Positive magnetic polarity energy:

              This is  identified  either  as  the  side  of a flat-surface
              magnet with poles on opposite  sides  or  as the end of a bar
              magnet that registers positive (+) on a magnetometer.

                                      Page 7





              This is  also  the  same  energy  as  the true physical south
              magnetic pole of the earth.   This  is  the same as the north
              seeking pole of a compass needle. A positive compass needle
              pointing north,  which  was misidentified as  north  pole  by
              navigators, is in fact a south pole seeking the north pole of
              the earth.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       This follows the   recommendations   and  use  of  several  authors,
       especially those interested   in   the   biological   responses   to
       magnetism, electricity and ionization and provides  the  consistency
       of parallel biological  responses  to  the  specific  separate  pole
       and/or energy of positive and negative  electricity,  magnetism  and
       ionization.

       Negative parallels are  the negative pole of a DC circuit,  negative
       pole of a magnet and negative ionization.  Biological responses to a
       negative magnetic field,   negative   electric   pole  and  negative
       ionization are parallel.

       Positive parallels are the positive pole of a DC circuit, positive
       pole of a magnet and positive ionization.  Biological responses to a
       positive magnetic field,  positive   electric   pole   and  positive
       ionization are parallel.

       Dr. William Philpott has been a pioneer in orthomolecular psychiatry
       and medicine.  No  longer in private practice, Dr. Philpott  devotes
       his time to raising health consciousness through his writings and
       teachings as a seasoned speaker at health and medical meetings
       throughout our country.  He also has been appearing on various radio
       talk shows. Dr. Philpott has written and sent to your editor several
       articles on Biomagnetics that are going to be published regularly in
       HC!  I find that he writes with a great clarity and understanding of
       his topics.  I have been a student of Dr. Philpott since the early
       1970s when I first began to hear his talks at meetings of various
       alternative health organizations,   especially   the   International
       Academy of Preventive Medicine, the  Orthomolecular  Medical Society
       and the Academy of Orthomolecular Psychiatry. Dr.  P.  is  author of
       three great booksBrain  Allergies:  The  Psychonutrient  Connection,
       Victory Over Diabetes, and his latest,  The Biomagnetic Handbook.  I
       encourage you to  read  each  of  these.   The latter,  as  well  as
       magnets, are available through HC as well as through :
