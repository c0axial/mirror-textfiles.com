                          Ocular & Visual changes in space.

            Before we  begin talking about the odd effects of space on vision,
       we need to agree on some definitions.

            These are:

                VISUAL THRESHOLD: the minimum  amount  of light that elicits a
                                  sensation of light.

                VISUAL ACUITY   : the degree to which the details and contours
                                  of objects are perceived.
                                  Visual acuity is usually defined in terms of
                                  minimum resolvable separation.

            Threshold is a complex phenomenon, depending heavily on conditions
       within the eye and in the surrounding environment.  Conditions such
       as optical factors,  the state of the image forming mechanisms  of  the
       eye;retinal factors, such  as  the state of the cones; stimulus factors
       such as illumination, brightness of  the stimulus, contrast between the
       stimulus and the background, length of time exposed  to  the  stimulus,
       and so on; and other, random factors.

            Minimum separation is the shortest distance by which two lines can
       be separated and  still  be  perceived as two lines.  People with sharp
       vision can resolve lines which are  very  close  together.  People with
       less sharp vision must either move closer to the target (increasing the
       apparent separation), or move the lines farther apart  (increasing  the
       actual separation).

            Taken together,   these   two  measures  are  reasonably  accurate
       measures of the overall state of a persons vision.  It is said eyes are
       the windows into man's soul.  The  importance  of  the  organs of sight
       cannot be over-emphasized.  The visual system, eyes  and  brain,  are a
       navigation system which   can  measure  distance  through  stereoscopic
       vision, detect motion, focus from  the  tip  of  the  nose to infinity,
       recognize a multitude of colors, shades and shadows,  adapt  to  a wide
       range of lighting  conditions,  coordinate an average 70 kg male/female
       in motion as complex as a ballet or as exacting as threading a needle.

            It operates  through  a zillion  neural  interfaces  in  a  system
       thousands of times more powerful than the most advanced  computer,  and
       does it all  without  any  conscious thought at all.  You simply decide
       that you want to do thus and so, and it is done.

            For all  its  amazing versatility, vision is a specialized system.
       Human visual hardware is a result  of  a  billion  years  of  evolution
       within the earths atmosphere where light is scattered  by  molecules of
       air, moisture, and particulate matter.

            But as  we  ascend  into  our  atmosphere  light  distribution  is
       changed, due to the decreasing density  of  the  air. The visual system
       receives information differently.  Sometimes this can  result  in  odd,
       even astounding, visual effects.

            Gemini 4  astronaut Edward White reported seeing networks of roads
       during his space walk, and so did cosmonaut  Nikolayev from Vostok 3 as
       early as 1963.   "During the day, the earth has a predominantly  bluish
       cast.....I could detect  individual  houses  and  streets  in  the  low
       humidity and cloudless areas such as the Himalaya mountain area.  I saw
       a steam locomotive by seeing the smoke  first.....  I also saw the wake
       of a boat  on  a  large  river in the Burma-India area...and  a  bright
       orange light from  the  British  oil  refinery to the south of the city
       (Perth,Australia.)"

            The above observation was made  by Gordon Cooper in Faith 7 [1963]
       and it generated much skepticism in the light of the thesis  by Muckler
       and Narvan "Visual Surveillance and Reconnaissance from Space Vehicles"
       in which they  determined  that  a  visual angle of ten minutes was the
       operational minimum possible  for   humans,   and   that   the  minimum
       resolvable object length [M.R.O.L] at an altitude of 113 miles would be
       1730 ft.

            This limitation of acuity was revised the next year to 0.5 seconds
       of arc for  an  extended  contrasting line and 15 seconds  of  arc  for
       minimum separation of   two   points   sharply   contrasting  with  the
       background.

            So how could these astronauts  "see"  objects  much  smaller  than
       this?  The answer  is  that  the  eye isn't the entire  visual  system.
       There is a  mind  intimately  connected  with  the eye, and the mind is
       capable of inferring details where  none  can be seen.  Orbiting at 237
       miles in Skylab it was possible to see the entire east coast [Canada to
       the Florida Keys] and resolve details of a 500 feet  long  bridge based
       on inference.

            Of interest  is the fact that even though a mechanical eye [camera
       system] can resolve objects greater  than  fifty  times better than the
       human eye, without  human  ability  to  infer, people,  possessing  the
       ability to infer, can match that performance--or even surpass it.  That
       leads us to our first conclusion, the first observed difference between
       visual performance on  earth  and  visual  performance in space: Visual
       acuity in space exceeds that of earth  norm  when  objects  with linear
       extension such as roads, airfields, vessel wakes, etc.

            An ability called by some the "Search Light Effect".   This  is  a
       positive factor.  In space, vision is sharper than it is on the ground.
       The next factor  is not so positive.  In fact, it can be a grave danger
       to anyone working in the space environment.

            We judge distance by the mechanism  of  stereoscopic  vision.   It
       works by fusing the twin images impinging on the eyes,  combining  them
       into one image,  and producing a sense of distance.  This system relies
       on reference points.  One object overlaps another, or the images

                                        Page 2





       received in either eye are slightly different.

            You can  demonstrate  this  to  yourself  by simply looking into a
       mirror.  As you look, close one eye.  You see one side of your face
       slightly more than the other. Now look  through the other eye.  You see
       the other side  of your face.  Now, with both eyes open,  you  can  see
       your face and  somewhat  of  both  sides,  and  along  with that visual
       impression you have a sense of how far away you are from the image.

            The sides of your face, perceived  unequally  in  either  eye, are
       reference points for distance.  In space one has to deal with a poverty
       of reference points.  For  hardware  evolved  in  a reference  oriented
       paradigm this poses a grave problem, once out of the space craft gazing
       outward the eye  can  only  fix  on  the stars [without even a twinkle]
       which for all practical purpose is at infinity.

            This induces a state called "Empty  field  myopia".   Empty  Field
       Myopia is a condition in which the eyes, having nothing  in  the visual
       field upon which to focus, automatically focus at about 9 feet.

            An astronaut/cosmonaut experiencing empty field myopia focusing at
       9 feet would be unable see objects at a range as close as 100 feet.  If
       another spacecraft, satellite,  meteorite or whatever entered his field
       of vision, he or she would not be able  to determine either its size or
       its distance.

            That is our second conclusion: Vision in space is  very subject to
       a lack of visual reference points, a condition which induces a state of
       visual "neutral lock"   known  as  empty  field  myopia.   Is  there  a
       solution?  Man does not face any hostile  environment  in  his birthday
       suit, the clothing industry and walk-in-closets say it all.

            In space  we  will  wear  our exoskleton just as  we  wear  winter
       jackets in winter.   We  will  wear our helmets with visors to maintain
       our internal environment, filter out all those nasty rads etc.

            Since empty field myopia is a result  of loss of reference points,
       why not just build them into the visor itself?  Give the  eye points of
       reference.  Create a  virtual  reality?  This line of speculation leads
       to amazing concepts.

            To learn more about the concept  of virtual universe in the helmet
       read: Journal: Air & Space, [Smithsonian Publication]
             Article: Big Picture by Steven L.Thompson.
                      illustrated by Dale Glasgow.

            About the  creation of a virtual universe with new  computers  and
       software in the   helmets   of  F-16  fighter  pilots--this  is  not  a
       theoretical posibility but a reality.  There is another downside to the
       performance of human visual systems in space.

            One aspect of a adaptation to microgravity  [space sickness] is an
       increased dependence on visual as opposed to vestibular  mechanisms  in
       the stabilization of the retinal image during head movement.

            This phemonemon  only underscores the importance of being aware of
       our visual ability.  This is our third  conclusion:  Microgravitational
       effects on the human visual/orientation system can cause  unpleasant or
       even debilitating effects.

            As if  that  weren't  enough,  studies  done  by  the  Russians on
       cosmonauts on effects of perception  of  colors  in  space  suggests  a
       reduction in the  perception  of  brightness  of all colors.   Greatest
       degradation seems to occur in purple, azure, and green.

            Conclusion number  four: Visual perception of color is impaired in
       the space environment,  with implications  for  color  coded  reference
       systems.

            And, finally,  there  are  the light flashes.  Not  the  so-called
       fireflies noted in  orbital flights by astronauts [shown graphically in
       the movie "The Right Stuff"] but lights  perceived  as  faint  spots or
       flashes seen after  dark  adaptation  in  the  cabins   of  the  Apollo
       missions.

            These light  flashes  described  as  white  or colorless have been
       classified as three types:

             1)  Described as "spots" or "starlike"  objects 66 % of the time.
                 Appearing in both eyes simultaneously or one eye at a time.

             2)  Described as "streaks" 25 % of the time.

             3)  Described as "lightning discharge seen behind  clouds" 9 % of
                 the time.

            It is  of  interest that the very same astronaut who reported them
       in the Apollo flights failed to see  them  in  previous Gemini flights.
       After the Apollo flights this phenomena was noted by  the  crew  of all
       three Skylab missions  especially  when they crossed the South Atlantic
       Anomaly.

            W.Zachary Osborne,  Ph.D., and  Lawrence  Pinsky,  Ph.D.,  at  the
       University of Houston  &  J.Ver on  Bailey at Lyndon B.  Johnson  Space
       Center conducted an  investigation of this phenomena and concluded that
       it was due to heavy cosmic radiation penetrating the craft.

            The fact that the effect was noted  only  after the eyes were dark
       adapted confirmed retinal  interaction  rather  than  interaction  with
       optic nerve.

            Which brings  us  to  our last conslusion: Radiational effects and
       light flashes, can be a problem to future space travelers.

            These are not the only effects  that we will (literally) see as we
       explore and move  out  into  space.  They are, however,  a  significant
       divergence from normal  human vision, and must be taken into account in
       both the planning and execution of  future  construction workers living
       and working in space, and it must be taken into account.

            Failure to do so can be costly, both in terms  of  time  lost  and
       valuable equipment damaged or destroyed.  It can also be fatal.  To the
       construction worker who fails to see a moving object coming toward him.
       To the pilot   that  misjudges  an  approach,  or  to  anyone  in  that
       environment relying on vision for safety.

            These are the effects: Unusual visual acuity
                                   Empty field myopia
                                   Space sickness
                                   Lost color perception
                                   Light flashes

       They must be  taken  into  account during the planning and execution of
       any space mission.  Failure to do so can be costly...or fatal.
