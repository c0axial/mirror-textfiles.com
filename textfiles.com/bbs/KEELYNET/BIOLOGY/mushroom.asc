                                  Manchurian Tea

       Youth!  Beauty!  Health!  The timeless quest!  But,  where  is it to
       be found?

       It is well  documented  that  there  are  pockets of people, who are
       centenarians, clustered not only in  the mountainous Caucasias where
       they are most celebrated, but also in other rural areas like Yakutia
       in Siberia, or the Poltaya District of the Ukraine, as well as Tibet
       and Spain.  Compare this to the elderly in the United States who are
       often medicated and  placed  in  nursing  homes resigned  to  dying,
       without ever thinking  of reaching the age of 100.  A centenarian in
       this country is interviewed, congratulated  by  the President of the
       United States and given a party in his honor at his nursing home, so
       great is this  occasion.   These centenarians in Russia,  Spain  and
       Tibet are actively involved in life at that age.

       There is an  area  in Russia called Kargasok, where the people are a
       dairy and vegetable eating populace  who  cherish  family ideals and
       traditions.  Liquor and  smoking are excluded from their  lifestyle.
       A common outlook  shared  by  the  inhabitants  is  not  to let life
       pressure them.  They  are  a  hearty,   outdoor  folk  who  work  as
       carpenters, bookkeepers, and farmers who usually  live  to  be  well
       over 100.  These  Elders  are  revered, active and valued members of
       society and family.

       The harmony prevalent in Kargasok  society  cannot  be reproduced in
       our Western world  of  stress and fast-paced living.   However,  the
       Russian centenarians attribute  their  longevity  not  only to their
       work habits, but also to the Yeast  Enzyme  Tea  which  has  been in
       their diet for hundreds of years.  This tea contains  a concentrated
       amount of high  quality  protein  which  the  body  ingests and uses
       immediately.  Yeast Enzymes respond to the living micro-organisms in
       the body and metabolizes it readily.

       The ancient, yeast-culture  tea which the Kargasoks believe sustains
       their excellent health into their  hundreds, found its way years ago
       back to Japan  again,  when  a prominent Japanese lady  traveled  to
       Kargosok, Russia.  Upon  arrival  there  she  made  an extraordinary
       observation of an  unusually  healthy   people.    The   women  were
       virtually without wrinkles and few other visible signs of aging.  It
       was disclosed to her that everyone drank at least  eight  ounces  of
       the Kombucha tea  daily.   To  make  this  tea,  the  Japanese  lady
       obtained a piece of the special yeast  culture  with instructions on
       how to make  it  with  her  close friends.  After  drinking  it  for
       several weeks, her friends reported an astonishing difference in how
       they felt physically.    Her   reports  also  claim  the  pronounced
       lowering of high blood pressure, the fading of wrinkles, the gradual
       beginning of hair restoration and  an overall feeling of well-being.
       Today, over a million Japanese people drink the fermented tea daily.
       It is a common conversation piece on television and over the radio.

       Dr. Pan Pen, a scientist of Japan, reports his findings as follows:

          1)  the tea helps restore hair growth after 4-6 months,
          2)  and gray hair will darken;
          3)  and it can strengthen the eyesight.

       Because he found  the  culture contains three basic  vital  elements
       needed by the body, he claims that the tea is a LIFE EXTENDER.

       Dr. Sklenar of   Germany   is  using  this  tea  to  support  cancer
       treatments.  He is also using Kombucha 1X and some other remedies to
       aid in cancer treatments.  He believes  that  this  tea  can PREVENT
       cancer if drunk daily.

       The first recorded use of Kargasok Tea was during the Chinese empire
       of the Tsin Dynasty in 221 BC.  It was referred to  as  "The  Remedy
       for Immortality" or  "The Divine Tsche."  In 414 BC, Dr. Kombu, from
       Korea, brought it  to  Japan during  the  reing  of  Emperor  Inkyo.
       Afterwards, this tea was used throughout China, Japan  and Korea and
       later introduced into Russia and India.

       It was called by several different names;

            "Fungus Japonicus",
            "Fungo-Japon Kombucha",
            "Pichia Fermentans",
            "Cambuya Orientalis",
            "Combuchu",
            "Tschambucco",
            "Volga-Spring",
            "Mo-Gu",
            "Champignon de Longue vie",
            "Teekwass",
            "Kwassan",
            and "Kargasok Tea"

       The Kombucha Fungus  is built in membrane-form and is a SYMBIOSIS of
       yeast cells and different bacteria.  Among these bacteria are:

           Bacterium Xylinum,
           Bacterium Gluconium,
           Acetobacter Ketogenum,
           and Pichia Fermentans.
                                      Page 2





       The Kombucha Fungus  needs  to  live  in a solution of black tea and
       sugar.  In the right temperature  they  multiply  constantly.   They
       don't build spores as yeast normally does, but instead multiply by a
       process which produces Glucuronic Acid, Lactic Acid, Acetic Acid and
       several vitamins.  The yeast culture transforms the  sugar and black
       tea into enzymes  useful  for the body.  The fermented mixture later
       contains not only these products, but also 0.5% alcohol.

       Glucuronic Acid is  used  in  the   body   to  build  the  important
       polysaccharides such as :

          Hyaluronic Acid - vital for the connective tissues,
          Chondroitinsulfat Acid - the basis substance in our cartilage,
          Mukoitinsulfat Acid - for the mucous and for the vitreous (eye),
          and also  Heparin  and  Lactic Acid which is especially  for  our
          colon.

       Kombucha works like a natural antibiotic.

       The Kombucha 1X  or  Kargasok  110  has been used for many hundreds,
       maybe thousands of years by those who believe it can

          1)  activate the glandular system;
          2)  stimulate the metabolism,
          3)  reduce weight,
          4)  lower Uric Acid,
          5)  lower Cholesterol,
          6)  prevent rheumatism,
          7)  prevent arthritis,
          8)  prevent neurasthenia,
          9)  assist in stomach-liver-kidney disorders,
         10)  prevent gout,
         11)  prevent boils,
         12)  prevent arteriosclerosis,
         13)  reduce hypertension,
         14)  prevent skin diseases, etc.

       The tea is also felt to rebuild the  colon  flora  and  increase the
       blood circulation and aids those under stress.

       We are talking  about  a  "Panacea" Manchurian Mushroom  that  takes
       seven days to  reproduce  itself;  it  looks  like a hot cake but is
       grayish in color.  Properly cultivated it:

          1.  Eliminates wrinkles and helps  the  removal of brown spots on
              hands.  It is a skin humectant.
          2.  Prevents  certain types of cancer; in Manchuria,  where  this
              mushroom came  from,  there  has not been detected one single
              case of  cancer.   Every day  people  drink  this  tea  as  a
              religious atonement.
          3.  During menopause, reduces hot-flash discomforts.   Just after
              drinking the  Manchurian  Mushroom  Tea,  you may feel a warm
              sensation, due to the fact  that the tea components "join the
              blood stream"  causing  a draining action of  toxic  chemical
              elements and  fluids, the reason for which you will notice an
              increased mobility  in  your  extremities  and  an  increased
              flexibility around your waist.
          4.  Helps prevent constipation.
          5.  Helps muscular aches and pains in shoulders and neck.

                                      Page 3





          6.  Helps  bronchitis,  asthma, cough in two or three days.  Will
              help children with the removal of phlegm.
          7.  Helps with allergies, also with aching nerves.
          8.  It is prescribed in kidney problems.
          9.  It has proven useful in cataracts and other formations on the
              cornea.
         10.  It  cleanses  the gall bladder,  helps  colitis  and  nervous
              stomaches.
         11.  Helps  heal diseases.  It will lower cholesterol  and  soften
              veins and arteries.
         12.  It will stop infectious diseases.
         13.  Helps burning of fat, therefore, helps to lose weight.
         14.  Helps insomnia.
         15.  Helps the liver to work more efficiently.
         16.  Helps to level off glucose and sudden drops of blood sugar in
              diabetics.  If  taken  daily,  it  will eliminate urea in 100
              days.
         17.  It has surprising effects on  the scalp, helps avoid balding,
              thickens hair and eliminates gray hair.
         18.  Helps digestion.

              HOW DO YOU PREPARE YOUR TEA AND PROPAGATE THE MUSHROOM?
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       You must use an enameled or glass pot or container  (3-1/2 quart pot
       by Visions).  No  metal rim.  When you handle the mushroom, take off
       your rings and any other metal that  could  be near proximity to the
       mushroom.  If you  are  using  a spoon, make sure it  is  wooden  or
       plastic.

       Heat three quarts  of water.  When it starts to boil, add one cup of
       light brown sugar and let it boil  for  five  minutes.  Turn off the
       tea and add five tea bags or 4 family bags; let it cool off.

       When cool, place the Manchurian Mushroom on top of  the  liquid  and
       cover the container with cheesecloth.

                      THE BACTERIA MUST BE ALLOWED TO BREATHE!

       Let it ferment  for  seven  days, undisturbed, in a cool place, room
       temperature of 70 to 75 degrees F.

       Remove the Manchurian Mushroom from  the pot and place it on a glass
       plate.  You will notice that it propagates itself by forming a "baby
       mushroom" right under  the  original mushroom.  Separate  them  with
       your hands by  pulling  them  apart.   Place each one in a different
       container with tea to start the process all over again.

       When you work at it, be in a meditative state.  It is sensitive.  If
       it falls down to the bottom of the  glass or enamel container, leave
       it alone.  In a few days it will come back to the top.   Don't leave
       it around bad vibes (like appliances, machinery, TV/radio equipment,
       etc.)  It helps  to  channel  some  energy  to  it through the glass
       occasionally.

       The tea where the mushroom stayed  for seven days is what you drink,
       but you can put it through a sieve (fine cloth).  You  can  store it
       in a pitcher  or  glass  jar (no metal lids or handles), or plastic.
       Keep this tea refrigerated.

                                      Page 4





       Take 4 ounces  (1/2  glass)  every morning, on an empty stomach.  Do
       not take more  than  1/2 glass per  day.   If  you  notice  the  tea
       becoming too strong or fermented, dilute it with freshly brewed tea.

       Did you ever read that there is a place in Siberia where people live
       to be over  100  or 130 years old?  And they are healthy  and  happy
       people?  We are sharing their secret.

       NOTE :  As  with  any  cleansing  process,  your  body  MAY  undergo
               conditions which would require appropriate but simple care.

             WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THE KOMBUCHA ELIXIR OR MANCHURIAN TEA
                          FOR PREGNANT OR LACTATING WOMEN!
