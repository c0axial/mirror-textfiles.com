       From: keith@raptor.cray.com (Keith A. Fredericks)

       In the Summer  1989  issue  of  Robert  Anton  Wilson's Trajectories
       Newsletter it is reported that Dr.  Michael  Persinger  has a device
       which can induce the UFO abduction experience.  I thought  that this
       was particularly interesting in light of some of the ideas mentioned
       by Whitley Strieber.

       If the UFO abduction experience can actually be induced in this way,
       then we might    think   that   the   phenomena   are   induced   by
       electromagnetic effects.  Can  biological   entities   as   well  as
       machines modulate/control these electromagnetic effects?

       It is also interesting that we apparently cannot distinguish between
       what is <<real>> and what is happening in a dream state.   The whole
       thing reminds me  of  the  series of books by Carlos Casteneda where
       the goal of the impeccable warrior is to become familiar with and to
       remember what has occurred in the <<second attention.>>

       An exerpt from the article follows.

       The Persinger Helmet:  Dr. Michael  Persinger  has  been making news
       again.  To test his hypothesis that electromagnetic waves can create
       UFO experiences and other <<paranormal>> perceptions, Dr. Persinger
       (Laurentian University, Ontario) has designed the most awesome brain

                                      Page 1

       machine to appear  thus  far.   The  Persinger <<helmet>> (as it has
       been dubbed) sends specific frequencies into the hippocampus area of
       the back brain  and  a  large  percentage  of  subjects  report  UFO
       abduction experiences, <<out-of-body experiences>>  and a wide range
       of Altered States of Consciousness, including <<union with God.>>

       None of the   HEAD  machines  previously  reported  in  Trajectories
       produced so many mystic states --  or  so  many hallucinations.  The
       helmet experience, Dr.  Persinger  says, <<involves  a  widening  of
       emotional meaning, such   that   things   not  typically  considered
       significant would now be considered  meaningful>> and hallucinations
       are <<percieved as extremely real.>>

       Dr. Persinger does not intend to allow this device  to  be  marketed
       for recreational uses   or   experiments   by   the   untrained  and
       unprofessional.
