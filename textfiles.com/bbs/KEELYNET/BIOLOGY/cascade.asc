                        The Medicine Men, "We Do Our Best"

       "A young man had an acutely inflamed throat.  He went to his doctor,
       who gave him  an injection of penicillin.  The sore  throat  quickly
       got better.

       Three days later the young man began to itch.  The itching got worse
       and he developed  hives  all  over  his  body.   The doctor made the
       correct diagnosis of an allergic  reaction  to  the  penicillin.  He
       prescribed antihistamines.  The hives disappeared.

       The young man,   a   machine   operator,   got   drowsy   from   the
       antihistamines and cut   his   hand  at  work.   The  nurse  in  the
       dispensary gave him first aid and  put on an anti-bacterial ointment
       containing penicillin.

       The hives returned and now the young man had swelling  of  the  eyes
       and lips.  The   doctor  recognized  that  a  potentially  dangerous
       allergic reaction was present; he ordered a course of corticosteriod
       treatment.

       Result - the itchiness, the hives  and  the swelling disappeared and
       the patient was well again.

       Except that now he had pain in his belly plus heartburn, and he

       began to show  signs  of blood in his stools.  The correct diagnosis
       of a peptic ulcer (induced by the corticosteroid) was made.

       The young man did not do well on medical  treatment; he continued to
       bleed from his ulcer.  His doctor, therefore, had a  surgeon  in for
       consultation.  The two  doctors  agreed that partial gastrectomy was
       necessary, an operation to remove  the  ulcer-bearing portion of the
       stomach.  The operation was successful.

       But because of  the  previous bleeding and the unavoidable  loss  of
       blood at the  operation,  a  transfusion  of  1000  milliliters (two
       pints) of blood was given.  Hepatitis  (inflammation  of  the liver)
       followed.

       The young man became intensely jaundiced; he vomited  his  food  and
       had to be  fed  intravenously  for a few days.  His youth did him in
       good stead as he recovered from his hepatitis.

       At the right ankle, where the intravenous  needle  and  the  plastic
       tube had been  inserted into a vein exposed by cutting  through  the
       skin, a tender   nodule  appeared.   It  became  red  and  inflamed,
       evidence of infection.

       Because of the  bad  experience the  patient  had  experienced  from
       penicillin, the doctor  prescribed tetracycline.   The  inflammation
       promptly subsided.

       But because of  the antibiotic, diarrhea came on and the patient had
       severe colicky cramps.  The doctor ordered a special diet and gave a
       new anti-spasmodic drug to control the cramps.  Diarrhea stopped.

       The new drug was in the belladonna  class.  It relaxed smooth muscle
       all over the body, and by its action on the iris, it caused dilation
       of the pupil of the eye.  The young man's vision was impaired.

       He drove his car into a tree. Exitus young man."

       This is a  true story from "The Medicine Men, the  Myth  of  Quality
                                  Medical Care in America today",
                                  by Leonard Tushnet, M.D.
