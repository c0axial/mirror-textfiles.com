                           A CANCER CURE IN ORANGE PEELS?

       According to a  newsletter called Alternatives, researchers  at  the
       University of Wisconsin   may   have   discovered  "an  inexpensive,
       effective compound that may both control and prevent cancer." This
       compound is found in the oil of orange peels and is known as d-
       limonene.

       When Michael Gould added the substance  to  rats  who had tumors, an
       amazing 90 percent  of  the  creatures  had  the  tumours  disappear
       completely!

       Only 15 percent  of  a  control  group  even showed any shrinkage of
       tumors.  Gould also found that d-limonene  shrank human cancer cells
       in the laboratory.

       Don't start eating  orange  peels just yet or drinking  orange  peel
       oil.  The toxicity level of the substance is unknown.  Rats fed high
       doses of d-limonene  over  several months developed kidney problems.
       Dogs, however, did not develop this problem.

       Another encouraging sign is that when  animals were given d-limonene
       one hour before they were exposed to cancer-causing  substances  "it
       had a very significant protective effect."

       Will something this  simple be the cancer cure that we have all been
       waiting for?  Will it cure some cancers but not all?

       Will Gould's research  not  be  funded because drug companies cannot
       patent the chemical and make large  amounts  of money from it?  Only
       time will tell.
