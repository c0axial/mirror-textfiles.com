                       MEDITATION AND RESONANCE EFFECTS
                                by Philo Stone

    (This  paper  is  from THE HOLISTIC QABALAH,  a series  of  12  books,

    The   use  of  psychedelics  or  empathogens  traditionally   involves
    effectual  traits or nuances which can parallel endogenous mystical or
    cybernetic landscapes.  This piece presents an introduction to current
    descriptions  common  throughout  all  three  fields.   A  promise  of
    increased  comprehension  so  far  as  metaphor,   symbol  and  effect
    surrounding  these and other cross-correlative fields is reviewed  and
    annotated.

    ...If  the manas is to preform its proper task of controlling  senses,
    it  must  reflect the ideal pattern that is laid up in the heavens  of
    Buddhi.   Only when that pattern is reflected in its mirror has it the
    standard of reference by which to judge...nor should we think that the
    possession  of such a divine standard by which to judge attainment  is
    far above us; one to which we may aspire in some dim future.  Here and
    now the Pattern is within us.

    Theoretically,  the practice of meditation is intended to withdraw the
    personal mind from its persistent preoccupation with external affairs.
    It  can  be seen as a form of training for the mind in switching  from
    matter to psyche.   There is a purpose.  It is to prepare the personal
    nature so that it is able to reflect and express its relationship with
    the Universal Self.

    Throughout  history  there  have been a number of techniques  used  to
    achieve a meditative state.   The most often used first step is a form
    of  rhythmic breathing.   If done correctly,  a sequence of strong and
    unusual  body  reactions occur.   These also will  eventually  trigger
    unusual psychological states via a type of resonance effect.  A closer
    examination of these resonance-relationships yields information useful
    in improving the meditation.

    Perhaps an example clarifies this:   When a subject is totally relaxed
    and has achieved a deep meditative state,  a slow,  rhythmic sine wave
    pattern can be registered by a cardiograph-type sensing device.   What

                                    Page 1





    is  being  measured  is  a standing wave in the  aorta.   There  is  a
    heart-aorta  resonating  oscillator which affects other parts  of  the
    body, including the brain.

    Resonance  occurs  when the natural vibration frequency of a  body  is
    greatly  amplified  by vibrations at the same frequency  from  another
    body.   Oscillators alter the environment in a periodic manner.   When
    in  a deep meditative state the regular movement of the body indicates
    that a standing wave is set up in the vascular system, specifically in
    the aorta.   This standing wave affects several other resonate systems
    in the body, all of which are driven by this large signal.

    A  paper by Paul F.J. New(1), and several current papers, indicate the
    presence  of  a major resonant cavity oscillator located between   the
    heart and the bifurcation,  where the aorta divides itself.   When the
    timing  of  the  pressure pulses travel down the aorta   coincide  (in
    phase) with the reflected pressure pulse, a standing wave is achieved.
    When  this frequency approaches 7Hz.,  a progressively amplified  wave
    form  is  created  by  resonance,  resulting in  a  large  oscillation
    affecting  every other circuit in the body tuned to this frequency(2).
      (Vangard note...Refer STALKING THE WILD PENDULUM by Itzhak Bentov)

    There  is  a resonance relationship to this frequency   with  standing
    waves on the Earth's crust.   If we assume that the spherical crust of
    the Earth represents a condenser,  then the frequency of resonance can
    be calculated on the basis of the equation:

                         Resonance frequency = C/7.3R2

    Where  C is the velocity of propagation of electromagnetic waves and R
    = radius of the Earth.  This frequency has been shown to be 6.4Hz.

    Thus,  a  harmonic  frequency  corresponding to the pulsation  of  the
    electrical charge of the Earth is present in the heart/aorta.

    The brain may be considered as a piezoelectric gel(3),  one converting
    physical vibrations into electrical ones.   Although the body movement
    from this heart/aorta resonance is relatively small,  0.003-0.009 mm.,
    the head is a dense and tight structure.   By moving up and down,  the
    skull accelerates the brain with mild impacts.  These acoustical plane
    waves  are  reflected from the cranial vault and are focused upon  the
    third and lateral ventricles.   A hierarchy of frequencies couple this
    7Hz. body movement to the higher frequencies in the ventricles.

    That which is that bright within the heart;  in that this man resides,
    innate with mind transcending death, with brilliance innate.

    In the book Biomedical Engineering Systems(4), Chap. 7 is a major work
    entitled  "Toward  A View of Man",  by Manfred Clynes.   Clynes  is  a
    medical  doctor  working  at  the Research  Center  in  Rockman  State
    Hospital,   Orangeburg,   New   York.    This  work  is  considered  a
    breakthrough in the fields of psychology and medicine,  known today as
    the field of psychobiology (biocybernetics).

    Clynes  took a number of volunteers and shaved their heads,  placing a
    series  of  electrodes in rosette patterns or various regions  of  the
    brain.    These  included  the  temporal,  frontal  lobe  section  and
    occipital  region.   In this way,  not only were the brain frequencies

                                    Page 2





    monitored,  but  directional shifts in these frequencies could also be
    determined by the geometry of the electrodes on the skull.

    The original purpose of Clynes' work was to find out how precision and
    order  exist  in  brain  processes;  to discover  what  is  inherently
    programmed in man and how he might make use of the inherent programs.

    These  individuals were given a number of images (form) and colors  to
    concentrate   on  while  their  brain  was  monitored  by   computers.
    Recording  from  opposite  pairs  of  electrodes  simultaneously,   he
    obtained  views  of  the electrical activity  from  different  angles:
    mathematically,  a  spatial  differentiation of the  electric  vector.
    What was happening literally was a mapping of consciousness.  A number
    of very important observations were made:

        1.  Certain qualities and relationships were of great importance
            to the   computer  than  such  quantitative  factors  such  as
            intensity.  This   meant   that   the   brain's   systems   of
            identification are based on differences, rather than intensity
            of the signal.

        2.  Thin  lines  were  found  to  produce  characteristic   evoked
            potentials, irrespective   of   size.    The  form  itself  is
            transduced into another form in the brain space time which can
            be measured.  There is a one-to-one correspondence between the
            visual form of the stimulus,  the  response form in the brain,
            and the perception.

    This  is,  perhaps,  the first physical description of the field of an
    archetype.  It is a geometrical structuring and has uniqueness.

        3.  The process of inhibition is as important for transducing the
            external world as is excitation.   Concentrating  on  specific
            lines of  geometry  does not constitute the changing stimulus,
            but their steady presence systematically  and radically alters
            the response to another changing stimulus.

        4.  Changes in intensity of a single color produce very simple
            response shape.   Light  and darkness (as opposites)  show  no
            evidence of  being  different  values  of  the  same variable.
            Rather, they seem to be the  result of stimulating and also of
            inhibiting different receptors.

    This,  the  evoked  potentials to light and darkness in no way may  be
    said to be positive and negative,  respectively.  White,  for example,
    appears in this view as the result of mutual inhibition of color.

        5.  These   experiments   clearly  imply  an  inherent   form   of
            organization and  not  a random learning of nerve nets.  It is
            possible to  mentally  recognize  and  perceive  the  stimulus
            within the first portion of the invoked potential.    Portions
            responding (in  the brain) which occur later than 0.3 sec. are
            seen as systematic processes,   or  tuned  circuits  to  those
            responses to specific in-coming stimulus.  This  is  a form of
            resonance in the brain to specific geometry.   This could also
            lead to the formation of memory.

        6.  Every perception has a unique counterpart as a space-time code
            form in the brain.  These space-time shapes are evidence of

                                    Page 3





            relationships between    the    external    world    and   its
            representation in the brain.    They act like keys to "unlock"
            specific parts  of  our  brain,  often  being  observed  below
            psychological threshold levels (subliminal).

    Clynes  literally  mapped fields in the human brain.   A computer  was
    able  to  identify and reproduce those geometrical figures  from  what
    that human was concentrating on,  either as a geometric form or color.
    The  individual  did not even have to look at the pattern  but  simply
    concentrate "in his mind's eye."   A standing wave means that the wave
    is  not  changed,   but  is  holding  itself  steady  in  one  certain
    geometrical thought.

    If  quantum mechanical properties of matter are actually the conscious
    property  of matter,  then one would predict that all phenomena  where
    quantum  wave  explanations  are important,  the  phenomena  could  be
    interpreted better in terms of consciousness.(5)

    Our  planet is surrounded by a Layer of electrically charged particles
    called the ionosphere.  The lower layer of the ionosphere starts about
    80km.  from  the Earth.   This charged layer is known to reflect radio
    waves.

    Since this is a highly charged layer, the ionosphere forms a so-called
    capacitor  with the Earth.   This means that there is a difference  in
    electrical  potential  between  the two,  the Earth  being  negatively
    charged  and the ionosphere being positively charged.   This potential
    varies somewhat but is around 200 volts/m.

    This is a fundamental type of electrical generator.   The solar winds,
    interacting with the upper atmosphere rotation, act as a collector and
    brushes of a generator.  The lower atmosphere can be seen as a storage
    battery for this gradient potential.

    This  electrostatic field  around the Earth can  be viewed  as a stiff
    jelly.   When  our  bodies  move  and  vibrate,  these  movements  are
    transmitted  to the  environment.   These fields  not  only impinge on
    our body but they  also affect  the charges inside our body.   When we
    are standing on the ground,  under normal conditions, we are grounded.
    Our body  then acts  as  a  sink  for the electrostatic  field and  we
    actually  distort  the force lines somewhat.

    Our  body  also has its own electrostatic field about  itself.   These
    field-lines are the result of the various biochemical reactions in the
    body.  This resultant bio-field couples us to the isoelectric field of
    the planet.

    A  "tuned  system"  consists of at least two oscillators of  identical
    resonant  frequencies.  If one of the oscillators starts emitting, the
    other  will  be  activated by the signal very  shortly.   Because  the
    coupling is ideal,  they will respond to the tiniest signals and begin
    to resonate.

    In  1957,  W.O.  Schumann(6) calculated  the  Earth-ionosphere  cavity
    resonance frequencies.   His works were updated over the years and the
    figure now used is at 7.5Hz.  As indicated previously, the micromotion
    of the body is about 6.8 to 7.5Hz.

    It is obvious that when one is in deep meditation,  it is possible for

                                    Page 4





    the human being and the planet system to start resonating.  There is a
    transfer  of energy.   It is no coincidence that this frequency is  in
    the theta region of brainwaves, the state of maximum regeneration.

    Information is embodied in a field, rather than just being a field.  A
    field  is  thus  an abstract quantity  of  information;  relationships
    between this point and that point in the universe.

    Astral  temples  are set up to evoke a certain correspondence  effect,
    like a resonance.   These temples are like a physical matrix, one with
    specific geometrical form and color.

    The  visualization,  in turn sets up a particular EM resonance in  the
    brain.   The  reverberation pattern is most explicit.   Clarity is all
    important.   Distortion minimizes the resonance effect and reduces any
    amplification to connecting other "tuned" oscillators in the body.

    Techniques  of extending this harmonious resonance have been known for
    thousands  of years.   These are the different meditative  techniques.
    Most slow down the metabolic rate of the body so that much less oxygen
    is required to keep the body going.

    As  one  becomes proficient in meditation,  the breathing  becomes  so
    gentle  as  not  to  disturb the resonate  state  of  the  aorta.   An
    automatic  process  develops  in  which the lungs  and  the  diaphragm
    regulates the heart-aorta system so as to keep them well-tuned.   This
    helps extend the resonant behavior even with shallow breathing.

    In  conclusion,  the  following  points should be made  regarding  the
    resonant effects available through meditation:

        1.  There is a heart/aorta resonance which links up with a number
            of other critical oscillators, including several in the brain.
            It starts at the heart.

        2.  Specific  geometries or geometrical mandalas (form and color)
            create resonance   effects  in  the  brain.   The  pattern  is
            repeated in the brain.

        3.  Specific geometrical systems can be used as "keys"  to access
            those specific archetypes.  Access occurs to the psyche.

        4.  This linking of resonant cavity  oscillators  can  be  seen to
            form a  common  thread, going from Hadit (DNA-RNA   helix)  to
            Nuit (galactic hydrogen-helium field).

        5.  By "tuning"  one's meditation,  it is possible to amplify and
            have access  to  the other resonant systems, in and out of the
            body.

    The  Human organism has usually been regarded as a complex arrangement
    of  chemical  elements and compounds.   The quantity and structure  of
    these  variables are our reference points for states of health.   This
    is the area of biochemistry and biochemical analysis.

    An  equally  valid  approach  is to regard the human  organism  as  an
    aggregation of electromagnetic fields which are constantly interacting
    and  changing as are their biological equivalents.   It has been shown
    that the human system is an emitter of electromagnetic radiations.(7)

                                     Page





    All  biological  processes  are a function  of  electromagnetic  field
    interactions.   EM fields are the connecting link between the world of
    form and resonant patterns.

    The  patterns are arbitrary forms which are non-physical.   Archetypal
    forms are based on inherent characteristics and correspondences.  This
    provides  a  basis  for  what  we would  call  resonant  phenomena  in
    archetypal systems.   EM fields embody or store gestalts,  patterns of
    information.

    An  archetype  may  then be seen as a specific geometrical  system  of
    standing waves occurring in the brain as a space-time shape ("key").

    In  living  organisms,  opposites receive their structure of  symmetry
    from  particular combinations of spatial and temporal  aspects.   Like
    reins on a horse,  each of the opposites of the psychological pair has
    its  own place.   This geometric property makes them capable of  being
    opposites.   The  activity  of each arm determines the  quantity;  the
    spatial  identity  of the rein determines the quality.   There  is  no
    monotonic  (or  linear)   transition  from one to  the  other  passing
    through zero.

    A  human being,  immersed in the galactic hydrogen-helium  field,  may
    also  utilize the pulsing feedback between man and the galaxy to build
    up  the  resonance effects,  much like we would tune a  radio.   These
    primary frequencies are multiples of the base frequency 7 Hz.

    These four nucleotides provide resonant frequencies for alpha,  theta,
    and delta (the characteristic brain states going from consciousness to
    deep  sleep:  14-2 Hz.).   This resonance relationship can be seen  to
    link with helium inside the body at various chemical sites.

    The  bridge  connecting  the  solar system resonances  and  the  brain
    frequencies seem to reside in the DNA-RNA helix.

    In a paper  by Oliver Reiser(8) from the University  of  Pittsburgh, a
    relationship  is developed between the four helium cores in an  atomic
    nucleus and the matrix forms on the DNA and RNA. Reiser describes them
    as  "radiation belts of thought,"   the four "nucleotides"  enter into
    the  dynamics  of  these nuclear properties.  A spheron is  a  nuclear
    constituent  roughly  spherical  in  shape and  spaced  in  concentric
    layers.

    The   platonic  solids  are  the  five  regular  solids  described  by
    Pythagoras,  now  seen  to form all crystal formations.   These  forms
    later became the basis of the mathematics known as group theory.   The
    so-called  "resonances"  were  specific combinations of  five  regular
    solids geometry.

    "Helions" is Pauling's term for spherons when he modeled the helium in
    the  sun,  the heliosphere around the Earth,  and the  hydrogen-helium
    plasma of the galactic disc.  An optically activated molecule, such as
    helium,  contains  an electron which is coerced into a helical path by
    electric   field.    This  one-sided  spiral  is  maintained  in   the
    intermolecular  transport  through protein molecules.   Note that  the
    protein  units  of "spherical viruses"  are packed  symmetrically,  in
    accordance with the pattern of cubic symmetry.   Once more we find our
    way back to Pathagoras and the Platonic solids!
