                         Sound Machine Heals Broken Bones

       Broken bones heal with lightning speed thanks to a revolutionary new
       device that bombards  the  body with low-intensity sound waves.  Arm
       and leg casts can be taken off up  to  a month earlier than usual by
       patients who use the amazing ultrasound module for  20 minutes a day
       at home.

       "X-rays definitely show   a  significant  acceleration  of  fracture
       healing when ultrasound is used,"  says  Dr.  Thomas Kristiansen, an
       associate professor of  orthopedics  at  the University  of  Vermont
       College of Medicine in Burlington.

       The module is attached by a cord to a lunchbox-size transformer that
       plugs into a  wall socket.  The round, 1 & 1/2 inch diameter head is
       inserted into an opening in the cast  and  placed  against  the skin
       above the fracture.

       The experimental treatment is still under study by the Food and Drug
       Adminstration.  If it's   ultimately  approved,  the   1.7   million
       Americans who suffer  arm and leg fractures every year could benefit
       in other ways, too, researchers say.

       "It would do  a lot more than just  rid  them  of  cumbersome  casts
       sooner," says Dr.  James  Heckman,  chairman  of the  Department  of
       Orthopedics at the  University of Texas Health Science Center in San
       Antonio.  "Their medical expenses would also be less, and they could
       return to work sooner."
