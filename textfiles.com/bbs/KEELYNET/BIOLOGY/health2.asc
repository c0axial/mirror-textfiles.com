                   Electric, Magnetic And Other Field radiation
                              Effects On Your Health
                                        by
                                    James Behr

       Lately, a lot of reports have been flying around, still unconfirmed,
       as the experts will tell you, about electric and magnetic fields and
       perhaps other forms radiation being dangerous to your health.

       The biggest exposure  you  get  from these fields are from your T.V.
       or video display terminal (VDT).

       There are two types of field intensities  VLF  (very  low frequency)
       and ELF (extremely low frequency).

       You could get  antiradiation screens to combat this  but  they  only
       work on electric  fields  at the forementioned frequencies but it is
       the magnetic field that seems to be  the  culprit for all the health
       concerns.

       Not to say that electric fields are by no means non-hazardous as the
       current controversy over the above ground electric  power lines will
       contest or the sleepiness in subways that is thought to be caused by
       the third rail electric field.

       The type of  health  concern  is  not  one of catching a cold due to
       these fields but  disruption  on   the   molecular   level  and  the
       disprution of DNA reproduction causing mutations or cancer.

       Let's take the  brain,  the  brain is composed of millions,  perhaps
       billions, of neurons. Neurons work by electrical stimulus. As we all
       know (or some  of  us  anyway) magnetic fields cause current to flow
       (among other things) and this includes  electric  fields  which is a
       form of magnetism. Imagine passing a very strong  field  say  in the
       subway and now imagine on the neuron level.

       The field will  have  a  profound  affect  on  the stimulus of these
       neurons either activating them or  dulling them which brings me back
       to the sleepiness a lot of people seem to suffer when  they get into
       the subway.

       DNA may even be more at risk by the a field's influence on essential

       enzymes for DNA  construction  causing the DNA system to malfunction
       and be diverted from the original "designer's" plan.

       This is all from two types of Wavelengths  on  a  spectrum  and they
       should be a  great cause of concern for all. But this  leads  me  to
       think: What about the other Wavelengths?

       Right at this  minute,  thousands of waves are passing thru the body
       from radio and t.v.  transmissions  and thousands of others sources.
       what are they doing to the body?  Not that I want to cause worldwide
       panic but it does make one wonder.

       Of course the experts tell us that all of this can neither be denied
       nor confirmed so you will have to draw your own conclusions.  As for
       me, I've taken no chances.

       I have on   my   radiation   suit  to  protect  me  from  the  other
       wavelengths, I'm sitting more than  28  inches from the t.v. and VDT
       with a grounded antiradiation shield and the back  of  the  t.v. and
       VDT encased in  lead  to  absorb  stray  waves.  This may seem a bit
       excessive but like I said I'm taking  no  chances.  Wait, isn't lead
       poisonous!?

       Vangard note...

           The subtle  energy  system of the body are known  to  be  highly
           sensitive to  both  electric  and  magnetic  fields.  When these
           fields become  resonant with  particular  components  of  living
           systems, phase shifting and excess amplitudes can induce changes
           not necessarily of benefit to the tissues affected.

           The DNA/RNA replication cycles are especially sensitive  to such
           artifically applied  electric and magnetic fields.  The hydrogen
           bonds which  hold the DNA staircase  together  are  very  easily
           broken.  This is referred to as "denaturation" and can allow the
           wrong amino acid to form in a wrong position on the staircase.

           This, in turn eventually leads to mutations and  a host of other
           symptoms.  We  refer  you  to  DNAMAST1  and  DNAMAST2  for more
           information regarding the DNA chains and how they operate.
