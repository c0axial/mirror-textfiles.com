                                    Magic Menu
                              (the Mayo Clinic Diet)

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Breakfast :  1/2 grapefruit or unsweetened grapefruit juice
                    2 eggs any style, 2 slices bacon, minimum
                             (You may eat 12 eggs and
                          12 slices of bacon if you wish)
                    Coffee or tea, no cream or sugar

       Lunch     :  1/2 grapefruit
                    Meat, any style, any amount
                    Salad, as  much  as  you can eat with any dressing that
                    does not contain sugar
                    Coffee or tea

       Dinner    :  1/2 grapefruit
                    Meat, any style, any amount, with gravy providing it is
                    not thickened with flour; of course, you may substitute
                    fish for meat.
                    Any green or yellow or  red  vegetables, as much as you
                    can eat.
                    Salad as above
                    Coffee or tea

                (dressings should be something like Lite Less Oil,
            Wishbone Classic, Dr.  John Vinaigrette - reduced calorie)

       Bedtime Snack : Tomato juice or skimmed milk

               1.  At any meal, you MUST EAT UNTIL YOU ARE  FULL, until you
                   cannot possibly eat any more.

               2.  Don't  eliminate  anything.  For example, don't skip the
                   bacon as breakfast or  omit the salad at dinner.  (THESE
                   BURN FAT)

               3.  The  grapefruit  is  important  because  it  ACTS  AS  A
                   CATALYST that starts the fat-burning process.

               4.  Cut down on coffee.  It is thought to effect the insulin
                   balance that  hinders  the  burning  up process.  Try to
                   limit yourself to one cup at each meal.

               5.  No eating between meals.  If you can eat the combination
                   of foods suggested, until  you are stuffed, you won't be
                   hungry between meals.

               6.  Note  that  this  diet  completely  eliminates sugar and
                   starches which form lipoids,  and  lipoids are what form
                   fat.  Fat does not form fat, it helps burn it up, so you
                   can fry your eggs in butter generously, and also on your
                   vegetables.

               7.  Note that with this "Magic Menu" you can  eat  what your
                   family eats    except   desserts,   breads   and   white
                   vegetables.  While your family eats these you may have a
                   double or triple helping  of  meat, salad or vegetables.
                   Eat til you are stuffed, and then force  yourself to eat
                   some more.   The  more you eat of the proper combination
                   the more you lose.

               8.  You can lose ten pounds  in  ten days.  There will be no
                   weight loss the first four days, but you  will  suddenly
                   drop five pounds on the fifth day.  Thereafter, you lose
                   one pound a day until the tenth day.  Then you will lose
                   one-half pound every two days until you get down to your
                   proper weight.

       This was being  passed around at the office where I work my "normal"
       bill-paying type job.  It looked interesting, so we now list it.
       If you lose weight following the above  diet,  we would like to know
       about it to  check  on  the success of the system.   Thank  you  for
       sharing.
