The following document was anonymously shared with KeelyNet and is taken as a
transcript of an introductory lecture given by David Hudson at the Northwest
Service Center in Portland, Oregon on July 28, 1995.

It offers additional insights into the researches of David Hudson,
particularly in light of biological and space/time effects.

So now I know your question is "so what the heck good is this stuff?"  If you
can't get energy into it and you can't get energy back out of it, what the
heck good is it?  Well what you come to find out is that in the superconductor
there is a single frequency of light, just like a laser, that is flowing
perpetually inside the superconductor.  And when it flows inside the
superconductor it produces around it what is called a Meissner field which is
unique to superconductors.

A Meissner field excludes all external magnetic fields from the sample.  What
color must it be?  It has to be white.  Anything that excludes all light from
the sample has to be white.  Anything that absorbs all light has to be black.
[How does this statement square with the flash in the pan from exposure to
sunlight?]  If it reflects all light it has to be white; now I'm talking about
a pure single element superconductor.  It has to be white when it is
superconducting.  [Check this out]

What you have to do is you have to take a radio frequency transmitter and you
have to resonance frequency tune the superconductor to match the frequency of
the wire.  [More likely tune the wire to match the superconductor].  So the
wire now is oscillation with its electron waves exactly the same as the
superconductor.  At that point the electronic pair can go on the
superconductor with no push at all.  Because electrons are continually moving
over here on the wire and they are seeking the path of least resistance.  And
so when you have them in perfect synchronization with the superconductor they
go on with no push at all as pairs.

Now this takes a little explaining because one spin one half electron plus one
spin one half electron are two particles.  Yet when these two particles become
perfectly paired as mirror images of each other they lose all particle aspects
and they become nothing but pure light.  This doesn't make sense either, does
it?  But that's the way it is.  Spin one half plus spin one half gives you
spin one which now is pure light.  Trust me it is so.  So they can't go on as
individual electrons, they go on as light.

Now the crazy thing about electrons is that one electron can exist in one
space time and if it moves to another space time it gives off light or absorbs
light.  It's moving from one space time to another.  Now we have light, which
is two electrons.  Light doesn't exist in any space time.  You can put 50
billion lights all in the same space time and it is OK.

Now we don't have a conductor.  A conductor you put electricity on the wire,
you got to take the electricity off or it won't flow.  You've got to ground
it, right?  With a super conductor it's not.  It can go on and go on and go on
and go on...and it doesn't have to come off.  Now if you want to take it off
you have to put a wire next to it and you have to resonance frequency tune the
wire to match the superconductor.  And when it's in perfect harmony you apply
a voltage and poof off goes the energy.

So if you literally can make a superconductor that stretches from Portland to
New York City and you put energy on over here for two or three or four days.
You don't have to take it off over there. It's ok you can keep putting it in.
And when they want it in New York they can resonance frequency tune the wire,
apply voltage and suck it out.  It gets a free ride from Portland all the way
to New York.  On this quantal wave of the superconductor, as light not
electricity.

How do you measure it if it has no voltage in it?  How is it possible to get a
machine that can measure this light?  And guess what, it can't be done.  Cause
every piece of instrumentation man has ever figured out always uses a
differential it must reflect and yet a superconductor has no voltage.  You
literally start the superconductor flowing by applying a magnetic field.  It
responds to the magnetic field by flowing light inside of it and building a
bigger Meissner field around it.

You can put your magnet down and walk away.  You come back a hundred years
later and it is still flowing exactly the same as when you left.  It doesn't
ever slow down.  It excludes, not 99.9999, it excludes 100.000000 of all
external magnetic fields.  There is absolutely no resistance in the sample; it
is perpetual motion.  It runs for ever and ever and ever and ever.

The Russian physicist Sakarov said in the 1960s that we are looking for
gravity and we are never going to find it as a magnetic field.  Gravity is
what is produced when protons, neutrons and electrons inter-react with the
vacuum energy.  That energy that is everywhere in the universe, timeless.
That energy that is there like the ether.  When you pump out all heat and all
matter; everything, there still is energy there.  It's called the vacuum
energy.  When the protons, neutrons and electrons inter-react with that energy
they produce gravity.  If there is no matter, there is no gravity.
Interesting theory.

Everyone kind of ignored it for a while.  Then this fellow by the name of Hal
Puthoff down in Texas who began life over here in the Bay Area in California
doing distant viewing experimentation.  Now he's working down in Austin,
Texas.  [H. E. Puthoff works at the Institute for Advanced Studies at Austin
in Austin, Texas.]  And he actually developed the mathematics for Sakarov's
theory of gravity.  He published this in 1993 in one of the top science
journals.  [It was actually published in the March 1, 1989 issue of Physical
Review A.  The paper is titled "Gravity as a zero-point-fluctuation force" by
H. E. Puthoff.]

In the mathematics (he actually does all his mathematical calculations) it
figures out that when matter begins to react in two dimensions, as opposed to
inter-reacting in three dimensions, (which by definition a superconductor is a
resonance coupled quantum oscillator resonating in two dimensions, not three
dimensions) he comes up with the mathematics which shows when it begins to
inter-react in two dimensions that it should theoretically loose four ninths
of its gravitational weight.  Did you know that five ninths is 56%, exactly.

So I decided that I've got to go down and see Hal Puthoff.  I've got to take
all my data and go down and see Hal Puthoff.  I said "Hal, we have the
experimental confirmation that, in fact, your mathematics are absolutely
correct.  In addition Sakarov's theory of gravity is absolutely correct.
Because this material only weighs 56% when it goes to the superconducting
state.  And Hal Puthoff says "Dave, you do realize that gravity is what
determines space/time.  And he said "Dave, when this material only weighs 56%
of it's true mass you do realize that this material is actually bending
space/time."  Now if you think about this it seems correct.  He said "Dave,
what we really need is a material that totally bends space time."  "A material
that has no gravitational attraction at all."  Less than zero.  It's what he
called exotic matter in his papers.  I said "Hal, do you realize that if you
heat this material it has no gravitational attraction at all?"

I've been reading papers on the vacuum energy.  Do you know that there is an
overlap between the thermal spectrum and the zero point spectrum; the two of
them overlap.  And so if you heat something it should inter-react with the
zero point energy.  Well this material because it was resonating in two
dimensions, when you heat it it literally loses all gravitational attraction.
You know what Hal Puthoff said to me?  He said "Dave at that point you
shouldn't be able to see the material."  I said "correct, you can look in the
pan, through the quartz tube and there is nothing in the pan.  But the pan
isn't weighing what it would weigh if the stuff wasn't in it.

Now I had mistakenly assumed that the material was just resonating at a
frequency we didn't perceive.  He said "Dave, theoretically it should be
withdrawing from these three dimensions."  " It should not even be in these
three dimensions."  I said "wow."

He said "Dave, you have to devise an experiment where you can do this: while
it is not there, pass an arm through the sample pan."  "So if it is there and
resonating at a frequency that you don't perceive you knock it out of the
pan."  Because when you cool it back down and it begins to reappear it always
appears in the same shape it was in before it left.  And he says "if it's
there you're going to knock it out of the pan, then when you cool it down,
it's going to return back in exactly the place it was before.  That's proof
that it left these three dimensions."  And he said "Dave, if you do that you
will never ever want for money."  Do you think a stealth plane is really
important?  What happens when it can literally disappear?

Now, what are some of the other aspects of a superconductor?  You see in 1988
I not only filed a patent on ORMES I filed a patents on S-ORMES.  The resonant
coupled quantum oscillating system of many atoms of these ORMES.  I have 11
patents on ORMES and another 11 patents on S-ORMES.  I have 22 patents.

What are some of the other aspects of a superconductor?  A superconductor; how
do you prove it's a superconductor?  You literally take a constant magnetic
field and you pass the material into the constant magnetic field.  If it's not
a superconductor if you apply a magnetic field you get positive inductance.
If you graph it, applied magnetic field vs. Inductance.  Magnetic field vs.
Inductance. [DH waves hands depicting a graph]  If it's a perfect insulator,
you'll run totally parallel.  No matter how much magnetic field you apply, no
inductance.  If it's a perfect conductor, just the littlest amount of magnetic
field on a perfect conductor will go straight up.  So between here and here
some place, most metals graph about like this.

If it's a superconductor as you apply a magnetic field it goes negative.  It
literally eats the magnetic field.  It feeds on the magnetic field and takes
it inside itself.  Negative inductance in a positive applied magnetic field is
the proof of a superconductor.

In other words if you had a machine that was a superconductor when it passed
by ordinary power lines, it would cancel the voltage potential of the power
lines.  Or if it passed by a home that had electric appliances it would
literally turn them off and cause them to flicker and go off.

Do you realize that if you had a machine that would do that, it could
literally move in space time is what Hal was saying?  That it could disappear
and reappear in space time.  It could withdraw from these three dimensions
into a fifth dimension where there is no distance, and there is no time
between here and other star systems and then reappear out of that in that star
system.  Have you ever heard of anything that does that?

Anyway, the material is very very important.  The material and the way it
works is very very important.  Because we are talking about controlling
gravity and we are talking about controlling space/time.

Now let me give you an analogy.  If, if it is possible for me to shrink your
molecular body down small enough, miniaturization that would make you so tiny
that you could climb inside of an atom, you'd be down in the world of the
quanta where there is no time forward and there is no time reverse: everything
is interchangeable.  There is no time as we know it.  You would become an
immortal.  You literally could live forever in the world of the quanta.

A superconductor is billions and billions and billions of atoms all acting
like one big macro atom.  And so literally you make yourself a vessel that you
can climb inside of that superconducts and you energize it and you exclude all
external magnetic fields including gravity.  And you are now in this world but
you are not of this world.  Hear me.  In this world but not of this world.
And literally by just heating it you can literally disappear from this space
time.  Just like that, gone.  Now you will still be able to see everybody
there, they just can't see you any more.  It's like being above the water and
looking down in the water at the fish.  You're not in their world.  But you
can see them.

[Someone from the audience interrupts with a question.]  "But you wouldn't
have any thoughts either because they produce electromagnetic fields."  [Big
silence from Dave Hudson. Then person from audience says]  "You would just
have pure awareness." [Dave Hudson recovers by saying] "That is correct."  As
you can see this becomes very philosophical very quickly.  When you come to
understand as we did that literally we decided well gee if we have this
analytical capability, and we can quantitatively and qualitatively analyze
this stuff where else is it?

So we went down to A. J. Bayless and got ourselves some cow's brains and some
pig's brains.  We carborized these brains in fuming sulfuric acid.  That was a
really raunchy thing to do but it was the only way we knew to do it.  We
weren't organic chemists, we were inorganic chemists so we destroyed the
carbon, carborized it, added nitric-nitric-nitric acid, kept taking it down to
fumes of sulfuric more nitric, fumes of sulfuric, more nitric till we got
rid of all the carbon.  Then water, water, water till we got rid of all the
nitrous compounds.  Then we did a metal sulfate analysis.  Did you know that
over five percent by dry matter weight of the brain tissue is rhodium and
iridium in the high spin state?

Did you know that the way cells communicate with each other is by
superconductivity?  That the U.S. Naval Research Facility knows that the way
cells communicate with each other is by superconductivity?  That they have
actually measured it using SQUIDS?  Superconducting Quantum Interference
Devices with a superconducting ring around the body.  And they have seen by
this procedure that literally light flowed between cell to cell to cell to
cell.  Did you know that your nerve impulses are not electricity that they
travel closer to the speed of sound than they do to the speed of light?  And
electricity travels closer to the speed of light?  Do you know what speed the
superconducting wave travels?  The speed of sound.  This, in fact, is what is
in your body that we call the consciousness.  It's what separates you from a
computer.

It literally is the light of life.  This is that part of your body that has
been there all of this time, that scientists can't find because their
instruments can't see it.  They call it carbon because it has no absorption or
emission spectra and they assume therefore that it is carbon when, in fact, it
isn't carbon.  That there are 11 elements that it could be but primarily
rhodium and iridium are the elements that are in your body right now.  And
that literally they resonance connect and literally flow the light of life
perpetually in your body.  And around your body you have a non polar magnetic
field which is called the Meissner field or they refer to it as the aura.

That literally these are the spirit atoms in your body.  These are the atoms
that are in resonant harmony and resonating with the vacuum energy.  And the
vacuum energy is another dimension where there is no time. Everything that
ever existed and everything that ever will exist is registered in the vacuum.
And I will tell you now, my friends, that when you meet your God, you will
meet him in the vacuum.  That is where all matter came from, that is where all
matter originated and that is where everything is recorded.  And your
connection is through these resonant oscillators that are in quantum resonance
with the vacuum energy.  That is what brings the light of life from the world
of the quanta up into the macro body you call your own physical being.

These atoms, in a macro state and dried, look like a white powder.  But
actually if you look at them under a microscope they look like glass.  You can
actually heat the white powder to 1160 degrees under a vacuum and it forms a
glass just like that window glass.  Another form the element can exist in.

When you come to understand that each of these atoms is resonating with the
vacuum energy.  You can't harness a single atom.  You can't put reins on it
and say work for me; this perpetual motion machine.  But when one atom is
resonating back and forth in two dimensions it creates a quantile wave that
comes off of it.  The next atom nestles in that wave and perpetuates the wave.

The atoms are actually too far apart to have any chemistry and yet they are
sitting at a distance resonating in perfect unison, harmony.  The energy that
literally rolls around one atom for ever and ever and ever: did you ever ask
yourself why an atom never runs down?  It is because it is dipping into the
zero point energy all of the time.  But now you have each atom in resonant
harmony with each other; each atom dipping into the zero point energy.  So now
you've got billions and billions and billions of them doing it for you.  So
what you now have is a perpetual motion machine.  You have something that
literally is running perpetually on zero point energy.  You actually can build
a ring of this material and it will flow and respond to the earth's magnetic
field.

For example, did you know that a single element superconductor, a type one
superconductor, will literally respond to a magnetic field of two times ten to
the minus fifteenth ergs?  And do you know that there is ten to the eighteenth
power ergs in a gauss?

And the earth's magnetic field, that the compass aligns with is about point
five gauss?  So an erg is the measure of the magnetic field around one
electron. And a superconductor responds to a magnetic field of two times ten
to the minus fifteenth ergs?

Gosh.  Literally, when you think; it registers.  So when you are working with
this material your thoughts are registering in the material.

In fact, some of you women will get upset with me when I say this but we
actually came to know these as female elements.  Cause what we did is we said
"you know we're going to flip these things.  We're just going to overcome
these things.  Cause if you just put enough energy to them you can make them
do what you want, right?  Sure.  We purchased what is called an arc furnace.
We took about thirty grams of this white powder and we put it in the furnace.
This furnace had an insulated crucible; it had a copper crucible in it with
water all around it to keep it cool.  You bring a lid to set down on top of it
and there's a tungsten rod that hangs down in it.  And it actually runs a
little arc welder which you strike from the tungsten electrode to the copper.

And in this arc you sit there and you stir with the electrode back and forth,
back and forth till you literally melt everything that is there.  Now what we
did was we pumped out all of the air, we back filled it with helium gas, for a
plasma gas, and we struck the arc.  It went bzzp, like that and shut off.  We
opened up the arc furnace, no tungsten electrode.  Now this tungsten electrode
is about the size of my thumb.  Tungsten is the filament material that they
make light bulbs out of.  The people who built this furnace said we could use
it for thirty five to forty times with no deterioration of the electrode.  We
could burn it for minutes and minutes and minutes and minutes.  We didn't even
get a second out of this thing.  So we sent to the manufacturer, got another
electrode put it back in it, put back on, closed it back up, vacuumed the air
out, put in the inert gas, struck another arc, bzzp, shut off.  Opened it up
again and the tungsten electrode is all molten into this powder.

What we found when we analyzed the powder after we did this, it wasn't the
same element it was before we did this.  And what we also found is that there
was an amplification of heat about two thousand times.  It was not chemical
heat, it was nuclear heat.  What we found is all the wiring in the laboratory
was beginning to crumble and fall apart.  You could go up to copper wires and
do that and they would just go to powder.

The glass beaker sitting in the laboratory near the furnace was getting full
of little air pockets in the glass and when we would pick them up they would
fall apart.  And that's radiation damage.  There is no other explanation for
it.  I'll show you tomorrow that Berkeley-Brookhaven has confirmed that this
is 25,000 electron volt photons.  [I don't remember being shown this]  Gamma
level radiation comes out of these high spin atoms when you throw too much
energy at them.  So like all females if you tell them you will force them you
will get absolutely nothing, but if you give them what they want, they will
give you what you want.  So you cater to these elements; you don't fight these
elements.  These elements are alive.  And what you have to do is give them the
chemistries that they want, cooperate with them, coerce them, give them what
they want and they will literally go back to the low spin state and you can
make them into metals, or you can use them in the high spin state.

Now everything was pretty interesting now till my uncle came up with this book
in 1991 called Secrets of the Alchemists.  I said I'm not interested in
reading about alchemy, this is when the church was involved in it and
everything, this was all perverted, I'm not interested in that, I want to know
about chemistry and physics.  He said "Dave, it talks about a white powder of
gold."  I said "really?"  And so I began to look into alchemy.  And the
philosopher's stone, the container of the light of life was the white powder
of gold.

Now I said "is there a chance that this white powder of gold that I have,
could it be the white powder of gold they're talking about?  Or is it possible
that there is two white powders of gold?  Now the description says it is the
container of the essence of life; it flows the light of life.  Well that we
had proven.  It's a superconductor.  It flows the light that is in your body.
They claimed that it perfects the cells of the body.

Well I can show you tomorrow Bristol-Myers-Squib research that shows that this
material inter-reacts with DNA, correcting the DNA.  All the carcinogenic
damage, all the radiation damage, all is corrected from these elements in the
presence of the cell.  They don't chemically inter-react with it, they just
correct the DNA.

I really became intrigued with this stuff.  What would happen if we give this
material to people?  It's not metal-metal bonding so it doesn't have heavy
metal properties.  So first of all we got a golden retriever and gave the
material to the golden retriever.  This golden retriever had tick fever,
valley fever and a large abscess here on his side.  And none of the
veterinarians could find any medicine that would get rid of it due to the
combination of all three diseases.  And they just gave up; they weren't going
to cure him.  We began giving him one cc injections of one milligram of the
white powder.  One shot in the tumor and one shot in the blood stream.  After
a week and a half the tick fever was gone, the valley fever was gone, the
tumor has shrunk down and disappeared.   So we stopped the injections.  About
a week later it starts coming back again.  So we start giving the injections
again and it shrunk back down again.  This time we continued about a week
longer and then when we stopped it never came back.  The dog felt great.

So then the doctor we were working with said you know this is really
incredible stuff.  He said you know I have an assistant that works in my
doctor's office who is a day or two away from death with aids.  He is being
fed intravenously right now.  He can't speak, he can't dress himself, he is
dying.  So he said "I'm going to start giving him just a little bit of this
material and see what happens.  A week and a half later he had pulled out all
the feed lines out of his arms, he was feeding himself normally, getting
dressed on his own, just doing great.  A month and a half later he was on an
airplane going back to a family wedding in Indiana and nobody even knows he
has aids.

This doctor says "Dave, this is like a magic material."  So he got a patient
who had KS; Karposi Sarcoma which is the cancer you get all over your skin.
This man had over thirty lesions all over his body and we began to give him
one milliliter injections into his blood stream.  After a month and a half
there was no more active KS on his body.  One milligram per day!  Now if you
are familiar with KS there is only one treatment and that is radiation
treatment.  And after a while you get the maximum amount of radiation and they
have to discontinue the treatment, then you get worse and die.  And this
totally got rid of KS lesions.

Then we started working with another patient who was actually not gay.  This
woman had received the aids virus in an invitro fertilization that was done
down at the University of Arizona.  There were ten women who received the
semen from this patient who had the HIV virus.  She was the only one who got
aids.  She had it for 11 years.  She was really starting to go down hill.  Her
white blood cell count and her T cell count were really classic.  We gave it
to her orally for the first time and basically there was no change in her
white blood cells and her T cells.  Now when we give it by injection the white
blood cell count goes from 2200 to 6500 in an hour and a half.  Unbelievable.

When we take it orally nothing happens to the white blood cell count.  Which
is the only analytical battle we have available.  After a month she said "I
want the injection; I want to see this increase my white blood cell count."
So we prepared her a shot and she took the material by injection.  At the same
time we gave her the shot, we pulled blood samples and sent them to [Noing?]
Laboratories in southern California for an infected virons per milliliter of
blood analysis.  She took the first inject ions.

She got high fevers, just like everyone does, so we said cut it in half.  She
cut it in half, (actually the doctor cut it in half) the next day she took it
and she went into seizures and she died.  I just found out from a man in San
Francisco that people who have taken AZT; that AZT can cause brain lesions and
Hodgkin's lymphomas in the brain.  Anything that dramatically stimulates the
immune system can cause them to go into seizures.  And so we don't take
someone with AZT and give them the injections.

By that time we got our analysis back from [Noing?] Laboratories and it said
the infected viron count was so low that this woman shouldn't even know she
had aids.  Now we didn't do an analysis up front so we decided well we'll
start giving this to people after we do a lab analysis.  We worked with a man
who had an infected viron count of 57,000.  He was so weak that he could
hardly walk; he used a cane.  The doctor said he gave him two to three weeks
to live.  He took this material orally and it took about 60 days to begin to
drop the infected viron count.  After 60 days it went down 30% every thirty
days.  By the end of seven months it was so low they couldn't even detect it
any more in his blood.  And that's taking 50 milligrams per day orally.

Now do understand, I'm not a doctor.  I have no interest in becoming a doctor.
What I wanted to know is, is it possible that this stuff works?  That is all
my interest was.  There was one doctor in North Phoenix that I gave two
bottles of the dried material to and he gave it to two cancer patients.  One
was forty two years old and the other was fifty seven years old.  They both
had breast cancer.  The forty two year old woman had had her breast removed
two years earlier and had extensive radiation treatments.  After two years she
was having pain in her neck, pain in her ribs. She went to a chiropractor that
couldn't help her. She finally ended up with an oncologist who said she had
cancer in her neck, her shoulder, her back, her spine, and your ribs.  He said
it is stage four, get your affairs in order.  We can give you chemo-therapy
but you are going to die.

The woman went to this doctor.  He gave her these capsules which was a month
and a half worth of pills.  She took this material, at a hundred milligrams,
for a month and a half.  At the end of the month and a half she went back to
the oncologist.  She had no cancer anywhere in her body.  I didn't even know
who the woman was.  I had nothing to do with giving her the material.  I get
this phone call and this woman says "Mr. Hudson, I don't know who you are or
what this material is, but it is really fantastic material.  And she told me
the story.

The fifty seven year old woman it apparently didn't work on.  We were then
back at the University of Chicago having cancer studies done with mice.  And
what we found is about half the mice it killed of cancers but the other half
the cancers grew faster.  But at the end of the study the cancer researchers
injected the mice with estrogen.  Which should have caused the cancers to even
grow faster.  Instead as soon as the estrone hit their bodies; within twenty
four hours all the cancers were gone.  And so what I suggest to people right
now is anyone who is over forty years of age I understand should consider
taking DHEA or some female hormone because in treating breast cancer the
female hormone plays an important role in the treatment of the breast cancer.

Now I'm not presenting this to you as technical information.  I'm presenting
this to you as my experience and what I can tell you about it.

We also had a doctor in Florida who was giving it to a pancreatic cancer
patient, last November.  He was dramatically losing weight.  He did not expect
him to survive.  So they were desperate for anything.  He took this for sixty
days and has now gained all his weight back and is doing just great today.
The doctor doesn't understand it.  He is just totally blown away about how it
could happen because nobody survives pancreatic cancer.

This is not an anti-anything.  This is not anti-aids.  This is not anti-
cancer.  This is pro-life.  It literally is the spirit.  The material is not
here to cure aids.  The material is not here to cure cancer.  The material is
here to perfect our bodies.  It makes our bodies be in the state they are
supposed to be in.  It is our own immune system that fights and cures the
disease.  If you can correct your DNA at every cell in your body.  If you can
correct the damage that's been done that brought about the cancer, if you can
correct the damage that has been brought about by the virus, the aids; you
literally will become a perfected being.  You will return back to the original
healthy state you were meant to be in.

This is not a medicine.  This material is, in fact, a philosophical material.
It is here to enlighten and to raise the consciousness of mankind.  If in
doing that it happens to cure diseases so be it.  It's real hard for most of
us to understand that this is what it is all about.

We are just about at nine o-clock.  Tomorrow I will lay out all the physics
that has happened since I filed my patent.  I will lay out all the theories
about superconductivity and the high spin atoms.  We will come to see all the
published literature; I will put it up on the overhead projector where you can
read the credentials; Brookhaven National Laboratories, Oakridge National
Laboratories, the Niels Bohr Institute over in Copenhagen.  You will see all
the papers on superconductivity in the body.  You will see all the papers on
literally the light of life being the superconductor.  And we will discuss in
depth the zero point energy, the vacuum energy, space/time, gravity.  And I
will explain it to you, I think, clearly.  And all of you will walk out of
here with a pretty good understanding of what gravity and space/time really
is.  And how we are just a hologram; a picture show, ourselves.  We are not
reality; even ourselves.  Then we will go into the history of this from four
or five thousand BC to the Tigris-Euphrates valleys, Zachariah Sitchin papers,
to the Egyptian pharos and high priests.  To the Hebrews and the Bible.  To
the prophecies of Nostradamus, the Keys of Enoch; all the prophesies relating
to this material.  And the prophecy that it will be here by 1999; will be
known to science.  So that is the story.  We will see you tomorrow if you feel
like coming.
