Subject: Chinese - Russian Scientists Join to Prove the
                   Body "Meridian Channels"
Date: 20 Nov 91 05:14:53 GMT

                      News from P.R.China :
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Chinese and Soviet Scientists Cooperate to Confirm the Existence of the
                    "Jinluo" Line ( Meridian Channels )
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Reflexology (manipulating areas on the feet to affect the rest of the
 body) was listed as "near bizarre" in a recent Times cover article on the
 alternative therapies (Claudia Wallis, "Why New Age Medicine is Catching On",
 November 4, 1991) compared with the "more credible" treatments like
 acupuncture, while they are both based on the same ancient Chinese theory of
 "Jinluo" system, the "meridian lines network" which links virtually all human
 (and animals as well reportedly) parts and passes the "qi" through them to
 maintain one's health and vitality. These channels are also strongly believed
 by most Chinese psi (EFHB in their term) researchers and qigong masters as
 the pathways of the subtle energies which carries psi informations. They even
 published papers measuring (mainly subjectively) the ESP message's propagating
 speed along the lines among the gifted EFHB children as typically several
 centimeters per second, and reported once the "qi feelings (usually tingling
 and bloating)" reach their forehead, the desired information appears as a
 picture on a special "TV screen" there. There are as many patients receiving
 the Jinlou-based traditional Chinese madicine treatment today in China as
 those who using Western medicien (many use both simultaneously since it is not
 unusual for a Western styled doctor, "Xi-Yi", also prescripts "Zhong-Yi"
 drugs and treatments along with Aspirin pills, etc.), since they took the
 Jinlou system as an established fact from their birth.

 No anatomic evidence of these channels was found so far, but studies
 on the subject is still carried in many state-funded Chinese traditional
 medicine centers, research institutes and universities. Professor Zhu Zong-
 xiang, who leads a group in the Institute of Biophysics of the Chinese
 Academy of Science (Academia Sinica) claimed that from 17 year's careful
 studies in his lab, they had proven there are really 14 Jinluo lines in the
 human body by three independent biophysical methods (Zhu Zongxiang, Xu Rui-
 min, et al., "A Study on the Low Impedance characteristics of the Meridian
 Lines before and after amputation", Ziran Zazhi[Nature Journal], 9, 281-287;
 Zhu Zongxiang, "The Advances and Prospect in Physiological and Biophysical
 Approaches to the Acupuncture Meridian System", Ziran Zazhi, 9, 327-332;
 additional references pending), including acoustic conduction speed and
 electrical conducting impedance. A detailed experimental channel location
 map had been produced by 1989. These claims have brought wide attentions
 among Chinese scientists and news media, partially because the claim is
 contradictory to a general believe that the system builds on the dynamic
 processes in the living body and therefore it will not be detectable in
 vitro.

 According to a recent news item from the official Xinhua News Agency
 (September 26, Beijing, Zhu Baihua reporting), Chinese and Soviet scientists
 are cooperating to further reveal the reality of meridian channels by using
 modern Biophysical means, and major progress has been made already.

 From the source, the research center headed by Professor Zhu signed a
 collaborate agreement with the Institute of Cytological Biophysics, Soviet
 Academy of Science, to lunch a series of morphological and biochemical
 experiments on Jinluo. The Soviet scientists would investigate the special
 structure of the channels by optical and electron microscopes, as well as
 to measure the lines objectively by biochemical (enzymic) methods.

 The news reports that the scientists from the both sides had made
 exchanges frequently since May, 1990. A delegation led by Professor Zhu
 visited the Soviet site in the past June, and Dr. Klamov (name translated
 from Chinese), director of the Cytological Biophysics Institute's
 radiology department, is working in the Professor Zhu's lab in Beijing.
 The report says the Russian researchers have successfully detected acupoints
 which on the whole agree with the Jinluo map made by Zhu's group.

 Also from other Xinhua reports, Dr. Qian Xuesen, the prominent
 Chinese rocketeer, Dr. Robert Jahn's predecessor of the Cal Tech Jet Propul-
 sion Laboratory's Goddard Professorship who provided the crucial supports to
 the China's psi studies from the very beginning, was granted by the party a
 one-of-the-kind "Outstanding Scientist Award" which was described as the
 highest honor ever to a scientist in China. The Chinese government had also
 started a "learn from Dr. Qian" movement throughout the nation's scientific
 and technological units. In the grant awarding ceremony attended by the
 party's top leaders, Dr. Qian mentioned that he will aim to further advance
 the "Somatic Science" research in China, among many other subjects like
 the Biological Sciences and System Science.
