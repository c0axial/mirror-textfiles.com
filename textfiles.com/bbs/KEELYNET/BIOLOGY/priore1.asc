                           The Bordeaux Magnetic Machine

            There was  once  great  interest in what was known as The Great
       Bordeaux Magnetic Machine Mystery,  or  L'  Affaire Priore'.  It was
       reported in the popular press, and in a number of papers  in COMPTES
       RENDUS des SEANCES de l' Academie des Sciences since 1964, sponsored
       by Robert Courrier.

            The machine,  built  at  the  University of Bordeaux by Antoine
       Priore, a 62-year-old electrical  engineer,  was  originally used to
       kill micro-organisms that produce rot in fresh vegetables and fruit.

            Subsequently, it   was  reported  that  wondrously   beneficial
       effects on experimental  subjects  were  obtained  by  the radiation
       emanating from the machine.

            Today, its primary use appears  to  be  in  cancer treatment of
       animals, where a  large  number  of  cures  have  been  claimed,  as
       described in further  detail  below.   Of course, human treatment of
       cancer is the final goal.

            The machine is reported to be comprised of the following:

                 1)  a large plasma tube excited by 430 V;

                 2)  a magnetron oscillator (9.4 Ghz, 40 Kw peak),
                     which pulsed on for 1 micro-seconds at a rate of
                     1 Khz;

                 3)  two high frequency oscillators (17.6 Mhz and 15.8 Mhz)

                 4)  and a magnetic field (1200 G)
                     which confines the  plasma  and  which  is pulsed at a
                     rate of 50 times per minute.

                ( G = Gauss a measure of magnetic field strength )

            The magnetron and the two high-frequency signals  are  mixed in
       the plasma so  that the 9.4 Ghz signal is modulated by the two high-
       frequency signals.

            The magnetic field at the table,  where the subject is located,
       is about 600 G.  (A second machine was also built which  was capable
       of producing an active magnetic field of about 1200 G.)

            Several experiments  have  been carried out.  Some of these are
       summarized below:

            1.  A cancerous tissue was grafted to laboratory rats.

                Twenty-four control rats died within 22-30 days.

                                      Page 1





                In those  rats  which  had been exposed to radiation to the
                magnetic field from Priore's  machine, the cancerous tissue
                was either  completely absorbed, or, if the  treatment  was
                begun after  cancer had started to spread, had regressed to
                the point of total cure.

                There were no observed bad  side  effects  and there was no
                recurrence of the cancer.

             2.  A  different  and  highly  malignant strain  of  cancerous
                 tissue, leukaemia,  which  can cause death in as little as
                 two weeks, was grafted onto laboratory rats.

                 Again, exposure to the  radiation  in  the  magnetic field
                 resulted in  the  complete  inhibition of  growth  of  the
                 cancerous grafts,  or,  if  the  disease  had  started  to
                 develop before  the treatment  was  begun,  to  its  total
                  regression.

             3.   Mice were inoculation with a microscopic  blood parasitic
                  (Trypanosoma equiperdum)  which  causes sleeping sickness
                  and death in short time.

                  The course of the experiment could be followed closely by
                  analysing blood samples taken daily.

                  All control animals died by the fifth day.

                  Mice exposed daily to  the  radiation  and magnetic field
                  survived (38   out   of   46   animals)   with   complete
                  disappearance of the parasites from their systems.

                  They also   developed  a  specific  immunity  to  further
                  infection.

                  Animals exposed some days  before inoculation appeared to
                  have developed an immunity.

            4.    Rabbits, which develop a chronic illness  when inoculated
                  with trypanosomes  from  which  they  usually  die  after
                  several weeks,  were  tested  with  the  radiation  in  a
                  magnetic field   with  the  same  positive   results   as
                  described above.

            A twenty-man  commission composed of well known men of science,
       medicine, law and other professionals, have begun and are continuing
       investigations into the claims made for this mystery machine.

            They have been able to report  experimental  findings, but have
       not been able  to  provide  an  explanation of the workings  of  the
       Priore equipment.

            Funding was  provided  by  the French Government to construct a
       third and more powerful machine which  cost 3.5 million dollars.  It
       was called the M-600 and functioned for about one week  until a huge
       tube in it  exploded.    Due  to  the inflation rampant in the early
       70's, the replacement cost would have  exceeded  one million dollars
       which was felt to be too high to continue the project.

            The story  of  this  remarkable work began in 1944 when Antoine
       Priore noticed some oranges which  had  been  left in a room next to
       some electrical equipment.  These oranges remained  in a fresh state
       while others not  near  the  electrical  equipment became rotten and
       putrid.

            This anomaly intrigued young  Priore  to  explore  magnetic and
       electromagnetic effects on  various  plants.   One  of  his  earlier
       experiments was the  exposure of lentil seeds to a magnetic field of
       225 gauss at electromagnetic frequencies of 80, 32, 3 and 10 Hertz.

            This caused the lentils to grow  12-15 centimeters in length as
       compared to only a 5 centimeter growth for controls not subjected to
       the same treatment.   The  effect  proved  similar   for  asparagus,
       tulips, and other plants.

            Hens' eggs were then exposed to the same energies which brought
       about hatching in 19 days as opposed to the normal 21 days.

            Later research  using cancerous tissue yielded partial or total
       remissions when exposed to these energies.

            Similar reports of tumor regressions  were  obtained by Kenneth
       McLean with the use of a 3000 gauss or greater magnetic field.

            Later tests made by Biraben and Delmon using a  field  strength
       of 4500 gauss   on  T-8  tumors  had  not  the  slightest  trace  of
       remission.  This showed that there was obviously something besides a
       magnetic field at work.

            Tests made  with the Prior machine  on  cancer  tissues  ALWAYS
       caused total remission in all tissues exposed to the  peach  blossom
       violet color which the machine emitted.

            The machines  of  Antoine  Priore were dismantled shortly after
       his death in the early 80's.

            Time will tell whether this has  been a great hoax, whether the
       French Government and numerous well known scientists  have supported
       a charlatan, or  whether  mankind  has  stumbled  on a revolutionary
       scientific development.

       Vangard note...
           It is interesting to note that T. H. Moray advocated the use
           of a peach blossom violet ray for the dissolution of cancerous
           tissue which formed on his hands when working with radioactive
           material....in addition Dinshah speaks of the violet/magenta ray
           for healing various cancers.
