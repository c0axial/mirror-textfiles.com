            REM Sleep Monitoring and Signaling Circuit and Program

Plans, description and Qbasic program for a dream detection and signaling
system.  The following device can be put together with just a few dollars of
parts from an electronics store (eg. Radio Shack), a hardware store and a
sporting goods store. Other requirements are:

      An IBM compatible PC with a game port and a parallel port
      DOS 5 or greater with the bundled Qbasic interpreter
      VGA monitor (optional - for graphing REM data)

My goal is to design a cheap, easy to assemble device that feeds raw input to
a computer requiring few or no additional purchased hardware or software that
will be fairly accurate in detecting periods of rapid eye movement (REM).  I
have very little money to spend on parts, not a lot of electronic design
background, and a decent amount of free time to work on a program that will
run it all.  I would like to thank John Goldsworthy for creating the basic
program structure that I was able to build on, since I haven't worked with
BASIC in many years, have no Qbasic manual and had no idea how to access ports
and files.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BASIC OPERATION OF CIRCUIT AND PROGRAM

An infrared (IR) LED reflects off your eyelid and into a PhotoTransistor(PT).
Any eye movement changes the amount of light entering the PT.  The circuit is
extremely simple in that the PT connects directly to the game port, feeding
the raw light change values to the computer.

The program as it is right now takes these changes and accumulates all changes
(over a value of 2 (user changable via menu), which I consider noise) for a
period of 10 seconds.  If the accumulated value (MOVEMENT) is over a user-
defined THRESHOLD the PERIOD counter is increased by one (0 -> 1).  Whether or
not that minimum is reached the timer is reset for another 10 seconds.  If
three _consecutive_ PERIOD's of THRESHOLD or more MOVEMENTs are read this is
an indication of "rapid eye movement", whether it is REM sleep or you wake up
and look around.

At the point REM is verified the FLASH subroutine is called, flashing the LED
a user-defined number of times.  Then the flash is disabled for a user-defined
amount of time (default 15 minutes).

During the entire monitoring time the TIME, MOVEMENTS and PERIODS are written
to a file.  There is a built-in graphing routine that will plot this data to a
VGA monitor, showing different colors for 0, 1, 2, and 3 PERIODS and for the
flash disable period.  The THRESHOLD line is drawn over the graph lines to
show if you chose a good THRESHOLD value.

Disclaimer:  I am providing these plans and program as experimental aids in
achieving lucid dreams by way of monitoring eye movements and signaling the
user when he or she is probably in a dream state.  I will assume no
responsibility for damage to your computer or yourself caused by using this
information.  The Infrared LED emits only .0005 watt of light/heat.  I am not
an expert, but even at a centimeter from your eye I can't imagine it causing
eye damage.  The green LED emits 6.3mcd, whatever that is (milli-candles?).
It flashes only at the start of REM sleep, so it shouldn't cause damage
either.  The wires provide a maximum of 5 volts of current-limited power.  If
they are plugged into the wrong pins or shorted together there is a
possibility of causing computer damage or fire.  Make sure to tape or use heat
shrink tubing on all exposed wires.

The program makes the circuit continuously self-calibrating, so slight shifts
in goggle position will have very little effect.  It is very cheap and easy to
make.  The program needs a fancy algorithm to more accurately determine REM
sleep.  Currently you need to watch the graph and determine the optimum
THRESHOLD movement level.

MINIMUM PARTS LIST (about $10 + or -):

  $1.99   IR LED/Detector pair (Radio Shack P/N 276-142)
  $ .99   Green LED pair       (RS 276-022) {or use red, yellow, "bright",
                               etc}
  $ .79   Diode (1N4005)       (RS 276-1104 any 1N4000 series will work, 2
                               diodes per pack, need 8 diodes=4 packs)
  $1.49   25 pin male D plug   (RS 276-1547) {printer port plug}
  $ .49   3.1K (or so) resistor (package of 5)
  $ .49   1K resistor          (RS 271-1321) 2 in parallel = 500 ohms
  $ .98   2.2K ohm resistor    (two packages of 5)
  $1.80   30 ft. (or distance PC to bed) of 4 wire phone cord (Home Depot)
  $1.29   "Intermediate" sized swim goggles (Thrifty Drug) or better ones
  $1.99   Game port (15 pin male) solder plug (hard to find)

Here is how the simplified circuit looks like.  Resistors are what I could
find on old PC-XT boards, and are not critical values.  The 3.1K can probably
be anything from about 1K to 50K.  The 500 ohm resistor should be at least 250
ohm and probably not more than 1K or so.  I used all eight parallel port pins
rather than just one.  I burned out my parallel port, and suspect either by
overdriving it by powering the LED with just two data signals soldered
together, or maybe by trying to print while the monitor connector was shorting
out the pins.

Basically, all you need to do is get eight small diodes, solder the banded end
together on all of them, and solder the other ends to 2.2K resistors and
solder them to pins 2 through 9 of the parallel port connector.  Put a plastic
tubing sleeve over each resistor/diode pair before soldering to the parallel
port to keep them from shorting together.  This configuration has the bonus of
being able to brighten or darken the flashing LED by changing the number of
data pins used.  I added that to the program.  Alternatively the LED could be
"effectively" darkened by adding increasingly more "off cycles" within the LED
flash loop.

The diodes in the parallel port circuit are there to make sure there is no
voltage feedback between on and off pins.  After burning out one port I'm not
taking any chances.  Any suggestions for a simplified circuit from a qualified
electronic engineer would be appreciated.  The purpose of all resistors is to
reduce the 5V to a point where the LED or PT won't be damaged by higher than
rated voltage (typically 2V).

A 4 wire phone cable is sufficient for computer to goggle connection for 5V,
 gnd, detect & flash.  Some concern about connecting the two printer port data
pins together may be warranted.  One pin might supply enough power to drive
the green LED.  You may want to get a 6 conductor phone cord at 2 cents more
per foot to add an additional sensing circuit that is in the program already
or to allow for an audio cue from a miniature earphone plugged into a sound
board with a vocal "You are sleeping" played at flash time.  Find out your
"dream signs" and use a cue you will recognize in your dream.

The NovaDreamer that this is patterned after does not use goggles, but uses a
very comfortable "light mask" type of device, something like a "Lone Ranger"
or "Zorro" mask.  I'll describe it and see if someone can come up with a
reasonable substitute in materials.

The mask is 8 1/2" wide by 4" high at the widest points.  It is made of a
vinyl material silky on the outside and textured on the inside.  There are 9"
by 2" elastic straps sewed into each end.  The other end of one strap has a 2"
by 2" velcro "hook" patch.  The other strap has three 2" by 1" velcro "pile"
patches sewed every other inch, so that no matter where the velcro attaches
there is 1" of hook/pile connection.

There is a 4 1/2" wide by 4" high pouch in the back of the mask that holds the
circuit board with 2 AAA batteries, 3/8" piezo-electric speaker, LEDs and PT
and electronic components (16 pin EPROM, 8 pin TLC25L2CP, 7 capacitors, 14
resistors + 1 SIPP resistor, 10 position switch, earphone jack, MC reality
switch) and it is held into the pouch with two 3/8" square pieces of velcro at
the top, back corners.

Stuck to the inside pouch there is a 3 1/2" by 3 1/2" cloth-backed on one
side, adhesive on the other side soft 1/2" foam rubber.  There are 1 5/8"
diameter semicircles cut on each side of the foam and a widened nose shaped
cutout at the bottom of the foam.  The semicircles center 1 3/4" below the top
of the foam.  The nose cutout goes to 2 1/4" from the top of the foam and out
to the lower corners.

There are 3/4" cutouts toward the bottom of the semicircles for the flashing
bright red LEDs on both sides and IR LED and PT on the right side.  All LEDs
are recessed into the circuit board, so there is about 1/2" between all LEDs
and PT and eye side of foam.  Your eyes will be back somewhat from there.

There is a "reality test" button on the front center 1 1/4" from the top.  The
foam rubber goes from 1/2" from the top of the mask down exactly to the bottom
edge.  This needs to be added to my circuit, since after wearing the mask
awhile people tend to dream that they are wearing it.  They need a reliable
indicator they can push that should flash the LEDs.

In a dream pressing the button usually doesn't produce the correct flash and
sound.  The button will reset delay cycles if held down for 1 second.  I
intend to add a feedback circuit with this type of switch that will
momentarily flash and sound the earphones if pressed quickly and will reset
delays or possibly change other features if pressed repeatedly or held for a
second.  This circuit would use wires 5 or 6 and would go to a joystick switch
terminal.  An easier way would be to connect a momentary contact switch
between 5V (with resistor) and the flash LEDs.

However, this would not allow a feedback to the program.  When the mask is
worn it completely blocks out light except for some coming in from the bottom.
It should be snug but not uncomfortable.

The Lucidity Institute sells another device called the DreamLight.  The
DreamLight mask itself is sold by the Lucidity Institute for $15.  Its
description is the same as the NovaDreamer mask without the circuit board.
The DreamLight with all associated electronics is sold for $1200.  It is
basically a NovaDreamer with several additional features including a wire that
runs to a computer module that will save data gathered from several nights of
monitoring.  I have tried calling the Lucidity Institute many times and always
get a recording.  They don't call back and I'm not going to leave a credit
card number on a recording.

I Added a second movement recorder on 9-13-94.  The main purpose for this is
to use in conjunction with the NovaDreamer to compare ND triggering with this
circuit triggering and find a correlation.  I am assuming REM for both eyes
will be the same.  The ND uses only the right eye for REM detection.

Putting the goggle over the left eye with a second PT on top of it facing the
ND flashing LED will record all ND flashes along with REM sensed with this
circuit.  I'll have about a week to test this with after I buy and install the
second PT.

I tested the ND for over two weeks with mixed results.  When I used two
joystick inputs they seemed to interfere with each other, causing a lot of
noise on the second movement sensor graph.  I had a lot of other observations
about the ND that would be too verbose to add here.

If you use goggles they should be assembled something like this (1 or 2 eye,
your preference):

       /---------\
      /   O   O<--\--IR & PT pair about 5/8" apart toward top of eye
      |           |
       \    O <--/--flashing LED
        \-------/

I used a 3/16" drill bit and a tiny file to make the holes slightly larger.
The IR LED has a fairly narrow beam of light, so it is important to aim it so
the LED light beam meets the center of the field of view of the PT as closely
as possible to where your eyelid is. If you use both sides of the goggle you
should put a flashing LED on both sides, but the IR/PT pair only needs to be
on one side.  There have been reports that the listed IR LED may not shine
directly out, so use one of the following techniques to find the path of the
invisible IR light.

Use a camcorder viewfinder in low-light to find the direction of light output
from the LED.  If not vertical try to place the LED so the light "shines" more
toward the PT.  Then simply line up the LED light axis so it converges with
the expected PT axis right at the eyelid.  Once you do that test it by being
_in_almost_complete_darkness_ with the "Calibrate" option of my program or in
the idle loop waiting for STARTTIME while displaying light values.

As you move your hand slowly toward the place your eye would be the values
should continue to increase.  After a certain point, hopefully closer to the
LED than your eyelid would be, the values will sharply drop off again.  Mine
had high values in the low 200's and a value of 0 with nothing blocking the IR
light.  These are total light reflection values, not movement (change) values
over a period as noted in the first paragraphs.

If you don't have a camcorder handy you can just as accurately determine the
light path by separating the LEDs from the goggle and pointing them directly
at each other, then rotating the LED and monitoring the output as above.  You
could also do that with the PT to see if there is a more sensitive input path
for it.  I would be interested to see if the PT had better sensitivity with a
non-vertical direction or if the sensitivity drops off very sharply.

Color the goggle lens black to keep out outside light, since it is very
succeptible to incandescent light.  I replaced the rubber seal on the cheap
goggle I bought (that left a ring around my eye) with foam rubber.  I think I
need a thinner foam layer, because now REM activity is less obvious.

The LED polarity (on the Radio Shack IR LED & flashing LED listed) is
determined by looking through the lens.  The opaque metal in the base is
divided in two pieces.  The smaller piece connects to the positive lead (V+).

The PT (dark red) should be connected reversed from this diagram.  Wrong
polarity will probably be indicated by an apparent open circuit with full
voltage at + side of LEDs/PT and nothing working.

If you add audio cues with a soundboard you can purchase a cheap set of
earphones (I used a $3.99 Memorex 1/2" wide separate foam pad set) cut the
earphone cord in the middle, _carefully_ strip the two wires, and connect the
center conductor of them to wires 5 & 6 if you got the 6 wire AT&T phone cord.
My SoundBlaster Pro has stereo output with a common ground.  I didn't need to
ground the computer end of the headphone plug, since it was already grounded.

The goggle end of the earphones needs to be grounded to the ground wire used
with the LEDs.  The center conductors connect to the same two wires used on
the plug end of the phone wire.  If the computer is close enough you can just
connect the headphones directly to the soundboard without cutting it, or use a
headphone extender.  Radio Shack has one for under $3 I believe.  An
alternative audio device would be a Radio Shack piezo-electric buzzer.  It
runs on 1.5V to 4V DC and could be connected directly to the flashing LED
terminals.  Add a toggle switch to one lead to enable or disable it.

The "reality test" button on the NovaDreamer could be simply emulated by
putting a resistor and switch between the flash LED and the 5V line at the
goggle (game port pin 1) or even just a switch between the flash LED and the
point between the IR-LED and the 500 ohm resistor as noted in the diagram.
