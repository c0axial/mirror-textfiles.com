                 FALL OF IRON CURTAIN FREES ANTI-AGING FORMULA OF
                    FAMOUS ROMANIAN CLINIC USED BY MOVIE STARS!

                  Doctors World Wide Proclaim Its Effectiveness!

       BUCHAREST, Romania.  -  On  January  6th of this year, only two days
       after the communist-backed Romanian  Government  was  overthrown, an
       American Doctor named Larry Wood started negotiations with the new
       Democratic Government of Romania to acquire the long-standing secret
       "anti-aging" formula of the famous Romanian Rejuvenation Clinic.

       For three decades now, gossip columnists in our newspapers have
       reported frequently that  certain aging movie stars  or  dignitaries
       were making trips  to  the famous Geriatric Institute of Romania for
       its famous rejuvenation therapy.

       It seems like every movie star or famous person has been there at
       one time or another; Liz Taylor, Cary Grant, Onassis, Kirk Douglas,
       Marlene Dietrich, Prince   Ranier,    Sommerset   Maugham,   Charles
       DeGaulle, Sukarno, Imelda  and  Ferdinand  Marcos, Stalin,  Chairman
       Mao---even John F. Kennedy, who went there for back treatments.

                            Zsa Zsa Is Frequent Visitor

       Of course we all see how young 72-year-old Zsa Zsa Gabor looks on
       TV.  The press  has  reported  that  Zsa Zsa, her sister Eva and her
       mother Magda have been there several times.  At $1O,OOO for a week's
       therapy plus the travel costs, food  and  lodging, the treatment was
       affordable only by  the  rich.   But  just one week  ago,  all  that
       changed.  Now anyone  can  afford  the  famous and proven anti-aging
       treatment.

       It all began in 1951 when Dr. Ana  Aslan was assigned to a geriatric
       hospital in Bucharest,  Romania  (she  was  Romania's  first  female
       physician and cardiologist).

       After a year  of frustration trying to help thousands of people with
       a multitude of  age-related problems,  she  began  studying  medical
       journals in her spare time, looking for something  that  might  help
       these poor, helpless people.

                           MAO Goes Up When You Reach 35

       Dr. Aslan learned from the Journal of Physiology that there was an
       enzyme in our  bodies  called "monoamine oxidase" (MAO), which stays
       at about the same level until we reach  about  age 35.  Then it goes
       up dramatically every year as we get older.  Many doctors  had found
       that the level  of  MAO  was even much higher in people who suffered
       debilitating diseases such as arthritis, neuritis, arteriosclerosis,
       senility and depression.

                            Lowers MAO 85% In Two Weeks

       Dr. Aslan began experimenting with  various  formulas  on  old white
       rats to see  if  she could lower their MAO levels.   Finally,  after
       over a year  of  experimentation,  she  found  the right combination
       which lowered the aged rats' MAO levels by an astounding 85% in just
       two weeks.

                   Test Subjects Lived 21.2% Longer Than Normal!

       The doctor knew  she was onto something  special  and  continued  to
       treat the rats with her new formula.  To make sure  their  treatment
       was scientifically valid,  she  tested  it  on  92O  aged rats.  The
       average test subject lived an incredible 21.2% longer than normal.

       After the long years of experimentation,  she  was  finally ready to
       try her formula on a human.  Dr. Aslan was fairly sure  it  was safe
       because she had  given  numerous  rats  huge  doses  without any ill
       effects.

                         Patient Thought It Was A Miracle!

       In the hospital where she worked was  a man suffering from arthritis
       so badly that he couldn't even move one leg.  Dr, Aslan asked him if
       he was willing  to  volunteer; the bedridden man and  depressed  man
       said he was  willing to try anything.  Within a day after taking her
       secret formula, the man was moving  his  leg freely.  Two days later
       he went home  from  the  hospital, walking as if he  had  never  had
       arthritis.

       Shortly thereafter, a  homeless  man  was brought to the hospital by
       the police.  He  was  dirty,  disheveled,   mute,  depressed,  in  a
       terminal stage of  senility, had no memory, and was  crippled.   Dr.
       Aslan felt if  she  could  help him, she would really prove that her
       formula worked.

                           1O9 Year Old Man Revitalized!

       Within a year  of  her  special therapy,  the  old  man  was  alert,
       vigorous, very mobile, and with much of his memory restored.  He was
       an Armenian named  Parsh  Margosian.  Newspapers printed  the  story
       with his picture.    A   daughter  who  hadn't  seen  him  in  years
       recognized the man as her father and brought documents to the doctor
       showing Parsh to be 1O9 years old.

                        KGB Came In The Middle Of The Night

       Rumors at the time were that Nikita  Khrushchev  was  suffering some
       affliction and didn't have long to live.  After the news of the 1O9-

                                      Page 2





       year-old man, Dr.  Aslan  said  the  KGB came to her quarters in the
       middle of the night and told her to pack.

       A month later,   Khrushchev   appeared    in    public,   remarkably
       revitalized.  At the same time, Dr. Aslan was made  the Chief Doctor
       and Administrator of  the  Bucharest  Geriatric  Institute, and soon
       became famous throughout the world.   And  so did her formula, which
       she calls "Gerovital H3".

                    Test Patients Lived 29% Longer Than Normal!

       Dr. Aslan kept meticulous records on the next 111 patients  for over
       15 years, making  sure  they  continued  their  treatment.   On  the
       average, these patients  lived  29%  longer  than  the  normal  life
       expectancy.

                   Increased MAO Affects All Parts Of The Body!

       MAO circulates throughout  the body, but its heaviest  concentration
       is in the  brain - the central nervous system.  A malfunction in the
       central nervous system affects every part of the body.

                      Many Doctors Didn't Believe It Worked!

       Dr. Aslan proved  with  her thousands  of  patients  that  Gerovital
       alleviated many aging   problems   such   as  arthritis,   neuritis,
       impotence, mental deterioration,  memory  loss,  psoriasis,  asthma,
       angina pectoris, ulcers,  arteriosclerosis,   depression,  skin  and
       muscle tone, sexual  drive,  wrinkle  smoothing,   loss  of  energy,
       osteoporosis and hearing  loss.  Some patients even found their hair
       darkening.

                               MAO Level Drops 87%!

       But most doctors didn't believe one formula could help all those
       problems until 1973, when Dr. Joseph  P. Hrachovec of the University
       of California found Gerovital reduced the MAO level  by  as  much as
       87%.  Dr. Hrachovec  was  considered the top scientist in the United
       States in geriatric and gerontological research.

                      Many Doctors Confirm Gerovital's Power!

       Dr. David Macfarlane of USC confirmed Dr. Hrachovec's research.  Dr.
       Arnold Abrams of the Chicago Medical  School  conducted  a series of
       carefully controlled double  blind tests of GH3 with  very  positive
       results that caused  the  enthusiastic  doctor  to visit Romania for
       more information.

                                 Works Very Fast!

       An East German physician, Dr. Fritz  Wiedermann,  treated  over  6OO
       patients with Dr.  Aslan's  formula  and  said,  "The  results  were
       stunning and happened very fast."

       To demonstrate his  point  about  the  speed  of  results, he showed
       reporters a file on a sixty-seven-year-old  female  patient given to
       crying jags, suffering from arthritis and a total inability to work,
       who was back  on  the job within one week of Gerovital  H3  therapy.
       Within three months after beginning the treatment, her swollen hands

                                      Page 3





       became thin again and her arthritis pains disappeared.

                                Hair Regains Color

       Two months later  her  hair  regained  its former color and began to
       grow in where it had fallen out.  To top it all, in her sixty-eighth
       year, the woman's wisdom teeth appeared,  "proving  how  extensively
       the regeneration had occurred in her case," says Wiedermann.

                     Doctors Say It Makes People Feel Younger!

       Dr. Keith Ditman,   Medical  Director  of  Vista  Hill   Psychiatric
       Foundation in San   Diego,   and  Dr.  Sidney  Cohen,  Professor  of
       Psychiatry at UCLA reported to the  Gerontological   Society in 1973
       that they found 89% of aging patients reported less  depression  and
       an increased sense of well-being after taking Gerovital H3.

                               Slept Better At Night

       In describing the  therapeutic  benefits  of  Gerovital,  Cohen  and
       Ditman reported that most patients who took the drug "felt a greater
       sense of well-being and relaxation,  slept better at night, and many
       obtained relief from  depression  and  the  discomforts  of  chronic
       inflammation or degenerative disease."

       Dr. William Zung,  Professor  of  Psychiatry  at Duke University and
       associate professor Dr. H. S. Wang,  reported  at  the 1975 American
       Geriatrics Society annual meeting that their double blind test with
       Gerovital H3 and  placebo showed significant improvement  of  mental
       condition of those getting Gerovital H3.

                            Double Blind Tests Confirm!

       Dr. Leonard Cramor  of  the  New  York Medical College agreed, after
       conducting his own  double  blind   test.    Dr.  Albert  Semord,  a
       prestigious member of  the American Medical Association  (AMA),  the
       New York County  Medical  Society,  the New York Academy of Science,
       the American Geriatrics Society,  and  the  New  York  State Medical
       Association, said after  using  Gerovital  H3  on  5O  patients  and
       himself for several months, "Every month I'm more stupefied with the
       results---not only physically, but mentally and emotionally."

                       78-Year-Old Makes Love Twice A Week!

       "And all my  patients  feel  the  same as I do.  I don't look my age
       (78), I fish, I hunt, I ski.  I  make  love  twice  a  week.  I feel
       extremely well."  Dr.  Edith  Pakesch  of Vienna, Austria,  reported
       that patients receiving  treatments  with Gerovital H3 all felt much
       better physically and it had "an astonishing  effect on their mental
       clarity and emotional stability."

                       Users' Enthusiasm Surpasses Doctors'!

       We asked the doctors in the U.S. if we could talk to some of their
       test subjects.  The  response  was overwhelming.   Robert  Entre  of
       Santa Barbara, California,   said,   "As   a   41-year-old  business
       executive, I felt like I was getting  old before my time.  I had low
       energy, looked pale,  haggard and felt angry and irritated  most  of
       the time.  After six weeks of taking GH3, I feel like I'm in my

                                      Page 4





       early 2O's!  It makes such an incredible difference!  I feel like I
       have a whole new attitude and outlook on life!"

                                 Feels Spry Again

       Clara Key of  Decatur,  Georgia,  stated,  "My  life was so slow and
       painful the past nine years.  Now, after three months of GH3, I feel
       like a spry  woman again."  Gerry  Stone  of  Moorpark,  California,
       replied, "I am a 5O year old design engineer who is  truly  grateful
       for this formula.    I   was  experiencing  depression  and  feeling
       sluggish.  Now, after seven weeks  of  taking GH3 I feel as though I
       have regained my  youth!   My  mind is sharp and physically  I  feel
       absolutely terrific!"

       Annie Bushell of  Halifas, Virginia, remarked, "I'm 89 years old.  I
       can remember seeing Halley's Comet  as  a young girl in 191O.  After
       taking GH3 for the past month.  I feel like I'll probably live to be
       over 1OO!  The aches and the pains are less, and my eyesight is even
       better!"

                           7O-Year-Old With High Energy!

       Jean Finley of Palm Springs, California, said, "At  the age of 7O, I
       thought I was  living  out  the  last  few  years of my life.  I was
       depressed and filled with anxiety  about  the  thought of dying.  My
       doctor asked me to try GH3.

       "After just four  weeks  I  noticed  an  increase in  energy  and  a
       comforting clarity of mind.  I've been taking GH3 for several months
       now and I  feel  like I'll probably live to be 1OO!  GH3 should be a
       part of every senior citizen's diet!"

                                 Sex Life Renewed!

       Ken Glen of St. Petersburg, Florida, confessed, "At age 53 I felt my
       sex life was over.  Now at age 62  (nine  years  later), I've got it
       back!  It really  makes a difference!"   38-year-old  Mary  Rand  of
       Thousand Oaks, California, replied, "Several months ago I suffered a
       severe head injury  from  a  horseback riding accident.  I thought I
       would never be the same.  None of my doctors' medications or therapy
       seemed to work.  As a last resort  I  agreed to test GH3, and I must
       tell you that it has made a big difference.  Not only  did  it speed
       up my recovery,  but  I can honestly say that I feel better now than
       before the accident!  This is a marvelous discovery!"

                             Flirts With Girls At 73!

       Guy Almond of Atlanta, Georgia, was  very  candid.   "I have a clear
       mind, a vibrant body and I'm flirting with the girls  again!   At 73
       that's remarkable!  I'm glad it's now available without being a test
       subject."   Jackie Carter  of  San  Diego, California, said, "I am a
       51-year-old nutritionist and  since   I've  been  taking  GH3,  I've
       noticed a remarkable improvement in my ability to think  clearly and
       I look and  feel  years younger!  Just when I thought I was starting
       to get old, suddenly I feel like I'm getting younger."

                             Rebuilds Life After Loss!

       Lorriane Flood of Van Nuys stated: "After my husband died I almost

                                      Page 5




       gave up on  life.   That  was  four  years ago.  Now, after only six
       weeks of taking GH3, I actually feel  like  getting out of the house
       and being people!  It's wonderful!"

       Dr. Ronald Klatz, D.O., M.D. and president of the American Longevity
       Institute, retorted, "It's about time Gerovital H3, the most widely-
       tested anti-aging drug in the world, is made available in the United
       States."

             Why It Took So Long To Be Available In The United States!

       Behind the Iron Curtain (before the recent change) communists were
       not eager to share their technology with free world  countries.  And
       the U.S. was  equally  not eager to share with them.  In fact, we've
       put people in jail for selling even computer components and programs
       to the communists.

                        Khrushchev Made It A State Secret!

       Dr. Aslan's discovery became a "state secret" after Khrushchev tried
       it.  And it still is a state secret today.  Doctors in the U.S.  and
       elsewhere were given samples to  test  -  but  not  told  the  exact
       ingredients.

       Many scientists in  various  countries  tried to duplicate  it,  but
       their formulas only worked about half as well, and some not at all -
       until now!

                       Communists Are Becoming Capitalists!

       Now that the  Iron Curtain is down, and Glasnost and Perestroika are
       here, the communists want to make  money.   And  they  are confident
       that no one will figure out how Dr. Aslan compounded  Gerovital,  so
       they are willing to sell it to us.

                       American Company Has Selling Rights!

       Vita Industries has just acquired the rights to sell a new, improved
       version of Gero  Vita GH3 in the United States from Dr.  Larry Wood.
       A company spokesman said that it will  take  about a year to prepare
       the packaging, advertising  campaigns and distribution  system,  and
       get a sufficient  supply  before  it will be available at your local
       drug store.
                         Limited Supply Available By Mail!

       Vita Industries has a limited supply  available  now,  and those who
       wish to try it may order it by mail or phone.  In fact,  the company
       president says he's  so sure everyone will be pleased with Gero Vita
       GH3 that you can try it for a month  without  risk.  He says to just
       send back the  empty bottle for a full refund.  The  price  for  one
       month's supply is  $39.95,  two  months'  is $69.95, four months' is
       $119.95, and six months' supply is  only  $149.95.  They accept most
       credit cards, but add $4.OO for shipping the order.

       Vita Industries' address is 37O2 South Virginia,  Suite  16O,  Dept.
       494, Reno, NV  895O2.  Their toll-free number is 1-8OO-345-9111; ask
