                   CURING CANCER WITH ULTRA RADIO FREQUENCIES

                              By George Lakhovsky

            A new  and  important application of very short wave-lengths
       is described in  this  article  by  one  of  the  leading  French
       scientists.

            The new   application  of  short  wave-length   oscillations
       described in this  article  is  one  of  the  most important ever
       found, and we are pleased to present  to our readers this article
       by Mr. George Lakhovsky, the well known French scientist.

è           The experiments described were carried out in  collaboration
       with several doctors and scientists of high standing and it seems
       from results obtained,  that  the  very high frequency treatments
       will play an important role in the future.

            We shall publish in a later  issue  another  article on this
       new system, together with the effects of ultra radio  frequencies
       in the treatment of other diseases in human beings.

            Since November,  1923, I have published in various technical
       and radio publications, several  papers  in  which I explained my
       theory that the instinct or special feeling, which  permits birds
       to direct themselves  in  space,  is  only  the  results  of  the
       emission and reception of rays by living beings.

            While developing this theory,  I  explained how thoroughly I
       was convinced that science will discover, some day,  not only the
       nature of microbes but the radiation which they produce, but also
       a method of  killing  disease  bacilli  within  the human body by
       means of the proper radiations.


                                     Page 1




            The researches  I  have  made  by means of special apparatus
       have shown such results, that I believe  my theory to be correct.
       This theory is that life is born from radiations,  kept  going by
       radiation and suppressed    by   any   accident   producing   the
       destruction of the oscillatory  equilibrium,  especially  by  the
       radiations of certain  microbes,  which  suppress  those  of  the
       weaker cells.

            Before going  any further in our reasoning, it is necessary,
       in order to  present the facts  to  the  uninitiated  reader,  to
       imagine what oscillations really are.

            The motion of a pendulum will be used for this  explanation.
       When a pendulum is displaced from the position of equilibrium, it
       moves back and  forth  producing  what  are  known as synchronous
       oscillations, until the energy stored  is entirely exhausted.  By
       means of a motor, a spring, or an electro-magnet,  it is possible
       to keep the   motion  of  the  pendulum  of  constant  amplitude,
       producing undamped oscillations.

            If, on the contrary, the source  of  power  is  removed, the
       oscillations die down  and it is necessary not only  to  re-apply
       the power sustaining   the  oscillations,  but  also  to  furnish
       additional energy to  start  the   pendulum   in   motion.   This
       oscillation of a pendulum reproduces exactly what  happens in the
       cells of a living being.

       ----------------------------------------------------------------

                                BODY COMPOSITION

            Our organs  are  composed  of  cells  formed  of  protoplasm
       containing various mineral  matters  and  acids,  such  as  iron,
       chloride, phosphorous, etc.  It  is by the combination  of  these
       elements that the   cells   detect   outside  waves  and  vibrate
       continuously at a very high frequency,  probably  higher than the
       period of X-rays or over all other vibrations known  and measured
       today.

            The amplitude  of  cell  oscillations  must  reach a certain
       value, in order that the organism be strong enough to repulse the
       destructive vibrations from certain microbes.

            The astrophysicians are actually carrying out experiments of
       great interest on the existence  of  vibrations,  which have been
       called penetration rays and of which the frequency is higher than
       that of X-rays and of the alpha, beta and gamma rays of radium.

            Such rays,  according  to  the theory, are produced  by  the
       earth itself and  some  others come from outside space (reflected
       cosmic radiations are termed "noxious rays"....Vangard).

            Accurate measurements have  proven  the  correctness of this
       theory.  Therefore, it is quite permissible to believe that these
       penetration rays, or at least some of them, produce the vibratory
       motion of living cells and consequently their life.

            For instance, let us suppose a cell vibrates  at  a  certain
       frequency and a  microbe  vibrates  at a different frequency; the
       microbe begins to fight the cell through radiation, and sickness

                                     Page 2




       is started.

            If the  cell cannot repel the stronger vibrations and if the
       amplitude of its own vibration is forced to decrease, the microbe
       gains in amplitude and its vibrations  begin to decrease and stop
       those of the cells, bringing on dangerous sickness or death.

            If, on  the  contrary, the living cell is started  vibrating
       with the proper  amplitude  by  inside  or  outside  causes,  the
       oscillatory attack is repulsed.   Such is my theory.

            The problem is somewhat similar  to the situation in which a
       rescuer finds himself  when,  coming  to  help   a  friend  in  a
       dangerous situation, finds  himself fighting hand to hand against
       strong aggressors.  The rescuer  does  not  dare to fire his gun,
       fearing to harm  his friend mixed up with the aggressors  in  the
       melee.

            Similarly, microbes  and  healthy  cells  are all exposed to
       electric or radio-active action,  which  could be used to destroy
       the unwanted rays  and it is difficult to suppress  them  without
       harming or killing  at  the  same  time the cells which are to be
       treated.  In fact, since Pasteur, scientists have been constantly
       searching for a means of destroying microbes.

            The great difficulty with  all  methods  found  was  that in
       destroying, the bacillae cell was attacked too.    The experience
       gained in cancer and tuberculosis treated with radium, X-rays, or
       ultra-violet rays, shows  how  difficult  is  the  world  of  the
       investigators.

       ----------------------------------------------------------------

                                  A NEW METHOD

            The remedy in my opinion,  is  not  to  kill the microbes in
       contact with the healthy cells, but to reinforce the oscillations
       of the cell either directly by reinforcing the radio  activity of
       the blood or  in producing on the cells a direct action  by means
       of the proper rays.

            During January, 1924, I began  to  build,  according to this
       theory, and with  the  purpose  of  therapeutic applications,  an
       apparatus, which I have called the Radio-Cellulo-Oscillator, with
       the firm belief that the cells vibrating at extremely short wave-
       lengths would find  their  own  in the Hertzian waves, which have
       the properties of producing extremely short harmonics.

            The cell with very weak vibrations, when placed in the field
       of multiple radiations, finds its  own frequency and starts again
       to oscillate normally through the phenomenon of resonance.

            This type of vibration are produced by the radio waves which
       I propose to use, is harmless, unlike those of x-rays and radium.
       Their application, therefore, does not present any danger for the
       operator.

            I exposed in front of my apparatus, during  long  periods, a
       certain number of microbes in culture, which developed themselves
       normally.   I, myself, have never felt the effect of these ultra

                                     Page 3




       radio frequencies, although I remained for a great many days near
       the apparatus, during the treatment applied to the living cells.

            It is  only  when  two  living  beings  such as a cell and a
       microbe, are in contact, that the  rays  produced  by  the Radio-
       Cellulo-Oscillator have any   direct   effect    upon    cellular
       structure.

            The experiments  which  I  carried  out  at  the Salpetriere
       Hospital in Paris, in the service  and  with the collaboration of
       Prof. Gosset, were made with plants inoculated with  cancer,  and
       the results were  described in a paper presented on July 26, last
       year, before the  Biological Society.  The  text  of  this  paper
       follows.

              "One knows that it is possible to produce  by  inoculation
               of Bacterium  tumefaciens  in  plants, ¸tumors similar to
               those of cancer in animals.
               One of us obtained experimentally by this method, a great
               number of  tumors.      These   had  various  degrees  of
               development.  Some of them dry up partially,  but  do not
               die entirely  until the entire plant or at least the limb
               bearing the tumor dies.

               Even removed by surgical methods, these tumors grew again
               on the sick limb."

       ----------------------------------------------------------------

                          THE RADIO CELLULO-OSCILLATOR

              "We propose to describe  in  this  paper,  the  action  of
               electromagnetic waves of very high frequency  obtained by
               means of   the   Radio   Cellulo-Oscillator   of   George
               Lakhovsky.

               This apparatus produces wave-lengths  of the order of two
               meters and less, corresponding to 150 million  cycles per
               second.

               A first   plant  was  submitted  to  the  effect  of  the
               radiation one month after  being  inoculated with cancer;
               at this time small tumors of the size of  a  cherry stone
               were visible  upon  it.   This plant was submitted to the
               rays twice, for three hours each time.

               During the following days,  the  tumors continued to grow
               rapidly in  the same ways as those on plants,  which  had
               not been submitted to the effect of radiations.  However,
               16 days  after  the  first treatment, the tumors began to
               shrink and dry up.

               A few days later the tumors  were  entirely  dried up and
               could be very easily detached from the limb  of the plant
               by merely touching them.

               The drying  action  of  the radio frequency radiations is
               selective and affects only the sick part of the plant.

               Even the inside sick tissues were destroyed, although

                                     Page 4




               they were  next  to  healthy  cells  in the center of the
               limb, showing that the radiations  had  not  affected the
               healthy parts."

       ----------------------------------------------------------------

                            THE LENGTH OF TREATMENT

              "Another plant was treated in the same way, except that it
               was exposed 11 times, for three hours each  time,  to the
               radiations of the oscillator.

               Sixteen days  after  the first exposure the tumors, which
               were rather large as shown  in  one  of  the photographs,
               began to shrink and dry up and were easily  detached from
               the limb exactly as in the first case.

               Again in this a case, the healthy parts of the plant were
               not affected in the least.

               A third  plant  exposed to the radiations for nine hours,
               that is, three treatments  of three hours each, was cured
               in the same manner as the two others.

               Sixteen plants  also innoculated with cancer,  were  left
               without treatment.   They  have  tumors in full activity,
               several of which are very large.

               These experiments   show    conclusively    that   plants
               innoculated with cancer an be treated and  cured by means
               of the ultra radio frequency vibrations, whereas surgical
               treatment fails.

              "In conclusion  I wish to call the attention of the reader
               to the fact that I have obtained  very conclusive results
               not only with a wavelength of two meters, but with longer
               and shorter wave-lengths. The main thing  is  to  produce
               the greatest number of harmonics possible."

            Such are  the results of my researches with plants.   At the
       present time, similar experiments  are  being  carried  out  with
       animals and it seems that the effect on cancerous  animals is the
       same as on cancerous plants.

            I am  highly pleased to present my theory and the results of
       my work in a scientific review of  the  United States, this great
       country, which has always been in the lead in the  fight  against
       this terrible sickness,  cancer,  and  whose  sympathy and help I
       would greatly appreciate.
