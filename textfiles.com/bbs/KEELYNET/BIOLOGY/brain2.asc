                    THE BRAIN / INDEPENDENT SIDES AND FUNCTIONS


           To give you a better idea of the differences between the 2 sides
           of the  Brain,  here is a list borrowed from Robert E. Ornstein.
           I thought that this text would assist those who were interested.

           NOTE:  It   is   the  right  side of the brain, that tends to be
                  neglected, beginning as  children  whe we were encouraged
                  to focus  on the three R's, later as teen-agers  when  we
                  were admonished  to  stop  daydreaming,  still  later  as
                  young  adults  when  everything  that seemed important to
                  us required developing our left-brain talents.

                  But while we strengthened  and  nurtured  our intellects,
                  we weakened  and all but forgot about the  intuitive  and
                  spontaneous side of ourselves.  Although it continued  to
                  function,  we became insensitive to it.

                  Fortunately, some  people never lost touch with this part
                  of themselves; among them  are those who  give us the art
                  and poetry that embellish our lives.

           I trust you can use this information in your  quest  to  see the
           potential of   the   power  of the human brain.  It has answered
           many questions that I've had in  various areas, and now it makes
           sense.
