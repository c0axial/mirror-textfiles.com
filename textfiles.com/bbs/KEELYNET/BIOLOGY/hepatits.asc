                     DISCOVERING A NATURAL CURE FOR HEPATITIS

           `After contracting hepatitis  B  during  surgery, here's how one
                     physician fought back and cured himself.'

                               By Karolyn A. Gazella

       Carson B. Burgstiner, M.D., was at the height of his  career. He had
       developed a thriving  practice  as  an  obstetrician/gynecologist in
       Savannah, Georgia. A highly trained  and  skilled  microsurgeon, Dr.
       Burgstiner was devoted to his profession. But his profession  nearly
       cost him his life.

                                 THE ORDEAL BEGINS

       "In 1983, I contracted hepatitis B after I had stuck my finger while
       operating on an infected patient," recalled Dr.  Burgstiner, who was
       49 at the time.

       The discovery of  the disease and the disasters that followed nearly
       devastated Dr. Burgstiner and his wife, Jacque.

       After his diagnosis, Dr. Burgstiner notified the Centers for Disease
       Control (CDC) and the Georgia State Board of Medical Examiners. They
       provided guidelines for  him  to  follow.  Because  he  intended  to
       cooperate fully, Dr.   Burgstiner volunteered to have  his  patients
       undergo epidemiologic studies.

       His patients stood  behind  him  through his ordeal, Dr.  Burgstiner
       explained. "I was very fortunate  to  have  such loyal patients," he
       said.


                                      Page 1





       Unfortunately, the local  media  soon learned that Dr.  Burgstiner's
       patients were being tested for hepatitis.   Headlines  on  the front
       page of the morning newspaper declared: "Source of  Local  Hepatitis
       Outbreak Discovered!"

       A detailed account of Dr. Burgstiner's diagnosis was included in the
       article. Immediately, his    successful    practice   and   sterling
       reputation were jeopardized.

       "The CDC and the local health department  proved that none of the 26
       reported cases of  hepatitis in the county were patients  of  mine."
       Dr. Burgstiner said.   The   newspaper   subsequently   published  a
       retraction on its back page.

       The publicity added even more stress for the Burgstiners.

       "After 26 years of medical practice  without  a  lawsuit, suddenly I
       had two past  patients  who  claimed that exposure  by  surgery  had
       caused their hepatitis  B,"  said Dr. Burgstiner.  As it turned out,
       both patients were infected by other sources.

       Dr. Burgstiner was  forced  to  discontinue   obstetrics  and  major
       surgery, limiting his   practice   to  minor  surgery   and   office
       gynercology. He was an aggressive, motivated physician, and it was a
       painful transition.

       "The economic and emotional impact was truly devastating," he said.

                              DOCTOR BECOMES PATIENT

       Coping with the  shock of local publicity as well as the frustration
       of having to refer all of his patients  to colleagues for obstetrics
       and major surgery  was  just  the  beginning  of  Dr.   Burgstiner's
       struggle. The devastating  side  effects and fear of dying from this
       disease began to surface.

       "A chronic hepatitis B carrier in  the United States today has a 255
       percent chance of dying of liver cancer," he said. "There is clearly
       an epidemic of  hepatitis  B,  with  over 300,000  new  cases  being
       diagnosed yearly."

       The fear also haunted Dr. Burgstiner's wife.

       "I remember when my husband and I attended a conference where one of
       the speakers was discussing hepatitis B," Mrs.  Burgstiner recalled.

       This was when  she realized the severity of her husband's condition.
       Their fear and  concern  fueled their  determination  to  fight  the
       disease. The devoted doctor soon became and equally devoted patient.

       "I've always believed strongly in the teachings of  my  professor of
       pathology, W.A.D. Anderson, M.D., who taught me that if you maintain
       normal physiology, you prevent disease," Dr. Burgstiner explained.

       Dr. Burgstiner is  the  first to admit that he is somewhat unique in
       the medical establishment.

       "For the past  29 years I have believed  in  preventative  medicine,
       nutrition, exercise, and  hormonal replacement,"  he  said.   "If  a
       gland dries up, you need to replace it."
                                      Page 2





       This philosophy virtually saved his practice and his life.

       Other than the  hepatitis B, Dr. Burgstiner was in excellent health.
       He asked himself, what gland could be deficient? What gland could he
       support in order  to combat his hepatitis:  Armed  with  a  thorough
       understanding of the human body, he realized the  thymus  gland  was
       the key.

                             THE CRUCIAL THYMUS GLAND

       "I had always  been  taught  that the thymus gland (which is located
       within the upper chest) is large  in  infants  but  atrophies  as we
       age,"" he said.  "The  thymus  gland has always been  credited  with
       controlling the immune system."

       Because hepatitis B  is  an  immune disease, Dr. Burgstiner sought a
       nutritional supplement containing  thymus tissue extract. He visited
       his local health food store, Brighter Day in Savannah.

       Dr. Burgstiner began  taking  a  thymus  tissue extract  supplement,
       along with 25,000  units  be  beta  carotene and a multiple vitamin.
       Within three weeks, after a seven-year  battle  with  an "incurable"
       disease, the E-antigen became weakly positive and the  liver studies
       turned up normal.

       "After being tested  every  week  for  seven  years, I almost didn't
       believe the test results," Dr. Burgstiner  said.   "Before  I shared
       the news with Jacque, I waited until a few more tests came back."

       "I was so  happy.  My  prayers had been answered," Mrs.   Burgstiner
       said.

       After another three   weeks  of  following  his  own  protocol,  Dr.
       Burgstiner became E-antigen negative  and  antibody positive. He was
       cured of hepatitis. To confirm his finding, he notified  the CDC and
       had blood drawn  at Candler Hospital, which was sent to Mass General
       (Harvard) and Scripps  Institute   in  California.  These  prominent
       health facilities conducted many tests on his blood, and all of them
       showed there was absolutely no trace of the virus in his system.

       Dr. Burgstiner shared  his  good  news  with a colleague  he'd  been
       communicating with about   hepatitis   research.   Dr.    Milton  G.
       Mutchnick, a gastroenterologist/hepatologist    at    Wayne    State
       University in Detroit,,  Michigan, had published controlled  studies
       where he converted  75  percent of his patients who were hepatitis B
       carries.

       "I was planning  on getting into  his  next  treatment  group,"  Dr.
       Burgstiner explained. "When  I  called  him  and  told  him  that  I
       converted myself, he asked what I took."

       When Dr. Burgstiner  told  him he was taking an oral thymus extract,
       Dr. Mutchnick explained that he was  using  thymus injections in his
       studies. After their   conversation,   Dr.   Burgstiner   sent   Dr.
       Mutchnick a bottle  of  the  oral thymus supplement. Dr. Mutchnick's
       preliminary tests with  the product  have  him  the  same  startling
       results.

       Today, Dr. Burgstiner is excited about the potential for helping

                                      Page 3





       others. "The impact  of  thymic  hormonal  replacement  has enormous
       potential in immune system diseases, from allergies and hay fever to
       rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, cancer,  and  AIDS,"  he  said.   "This
       simple glandular hormone could answer a lot of prayers."

       Understandably, Mrs. Burgstiner   is  thrilled.  Her   husband   has
       regained his thriving  practice,  but  even more importantly, he has
       regained his health.

       "I've gotten a second chance, and I want to help as many people as I
       can," Dr. Burgstiner said.

                              DEALING WITH HEPATITIS

       Hepatitis is an  infection of the  liver  caused  by  the  hepatitis
       virus. Basically, there are two main strains of the hepatitis virus.
       Hepatitis A is  more  common  and more contagious.  The  chances  of
       complete recovery from hepatitis A are very good.

       Hepatitis B, on   the  other  hand,  is  much  more  serious.   With
       hepatitis B, the symptoms are more  severe and last longer than with
       hepatitis A. One  of  the more serious outcomes of  hepatitis  B  is
       chronic liver disease.

       TRANSMISSION: Transmission of   hepatitis   B  is  very  similar  to
       transmission of the AIDS virus. Common  sources of infection include
       blood transfusions, intravenous  drug abuse, needle  punctures  from
       acupuncture or tattooing, and sexual contact.

       The virus can  spread  through  contact  with infected saliva, nasal
       mucus, sperm and blood. Hepatitis  B may also be transmitted through
       pregnancy from the infected mother to her unborn baby.

       SYMPTOMS: The symptoms of any type of hepatitis include  fatigue  or
       extreme weakness, jaundice  (yellowing of the skin and the whites of
       the eyes), nausea,  dark  brownish   urine,   fever,  and  abdominal
       discomfort. The severity  and range of symptoms vary  from  case  to
       case.

       DIAGNOSIS: Hepatitis is  suspected when the above-mentioned symptoms
       are present. Exact diagnosis is confirmed  by  specific  blood tests
       that determine elevated liver enzymes and measure antibody activity.

       TREATMENT: Although there is presently no known cure  for  hepatitis
       B, a vaccination  is  available.  Health care workers are especially
       encouraged to get the vaccination.

       Various nutritional factors should be considered in the treatment of
       hepatitis B. Many  natural  liver-supporting   techniques  are  also
       recommended. The use  of  an  oral  thymic  fraction  supplement  to
       convert hepatitis B  carries  is  presently  being  explored in more
       detail.

       Because hepatitis A  is  so  contagious,  scrupulous  sanitation  is
       essential. Clothing and bed linen require special handling when they
       are visibly soiled, and should be laundered with  a  detergent  that
       kills germs. Contaminated  toilets and floors should be cleaned with
       a disinfectant.

       Patients with hepatitis A are advised to get plenty of bed rest.  In
       the first few  weeks of the infection, alcohol is prohibited.  After
       a bout with  hepatitis  A,  patients  develop  an  immunity  to  the
       disease.
