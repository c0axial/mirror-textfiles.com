            This information was given to us by a close friend, Mrs.  Hetty
       Quarrella, from Michigan.   Hetty  has  been  doing  research in the
       health field for many years.

            She has many friends in the  Michigan  area  who  work  in  the
       science community researching  various  aspects of  field  energies.
       They thought that this would be a good article for the KeelyNet.

            Also if  you  are  not  aware,  this is a peak year for sunspot
       activity.  This solar  cycle  occurs  every  11  years.   Electronic
       communications are most effected by this, particularly  radio. There
       are many BBS  systems  for  short wave radio operators which monitor
       sunspot activity.
                                                                R.B.

            In addition, high concentrations of solar radiation contain
       invisible rays in the UltraViolet  region.  It is a proven fact that
       tissues are MOST  SENSITIVE  to the 260 nm frequency,  although  the
       range of 200 to 350 nm has been proven to be the band most harmful.

            Cellular injury  takes  the  form  of  mutation  or  death when
       subjected to intense doses of light in this range.

            Photobiologists found that the  wavelength  of UV that was most
       EFFICIENT AT BRINGING ABOUT CELL DEATH was precisely  the wavelength
       that DNA ABSORBED MOST EFFICIENTLY.

            Fortunately for  earth  surface dwellers, little of the intense
       UV light actually makes it to the  surface  due  to  our  protective
       atmopshere.

            Of the UV rays that do penetrate, sunburn occurs as a result of
       overexposure to such radiation.  It occurs when one  is exposed to a
       substantial amount of   sunlight   without  the  skin  being  tanned
       (pigmented with melanin).

            The action  spectrum necessary  to  produce  the  MAXIMUM  skin
       reddening occurs at about 290 nm, a wavelength present  in  sunlight
       even at the earth's surface.

            The reddening   that  we  notice  is  a  result  of  vasoactive
       (vascular system affected)  substances   being   released   in   the
       epidermis by the radiation.

            Immediately following   the  reddening,  skin  pigmentation  or
       tanning occurs when melanin appears at the skin surface.

                          SOLAR RADIATION AND YOUR HEALTH

            Based upon information given  to  us by one of our professional
       client's, it is our desire to pass along to you and your family some
       health maintenance tips.

            As a  result of solar radiation activity this  summer,  certain
       days, from the  beginning  of  August,  thru to the end of February,
       have been designated as "Days of High Intensity Solar Radiation".

                         These "Red Days" are as follows:

            The entire month of August
            September.................. 1, 5, 7, 8, 21, 23
            October....................15, 22
            November................... 1, 10, 15 thru 22
            December................... 1, 2, 12, 30
            January....................15, 27
            February...................18 thru 21

            Precautionary measures taken  by  you and your family will help
       in reducing the risk of an overdose to this solar radiation.

            A few common sense measures include:

            1. Make sure that your skin is not in direct contact  with  the
               sun during the days listed above.

            2. Wear  a  total sun-block tanning product on those areas that
               must be exposed to the sun, such as "Sun Down".

            3. Make sure that you wear  a  hat  on  your  head  when out in
               direct sunlight.

            4. Taken  internally, "Paba", an ingredient found  in  the  "B"
               vitamin complex.

            Should you feel you have overexposed yourself to the sun's rays
       on any one  of  the  day's  listed  above,  you can help yourself by
       taking a bath, and mixing in your  bath  water,  one  (1) cup of sea
       salt, along with one (1) cup of baking soda.

            This will  help  to reduce the skin irritation  resulting  from
       overexposure to the sun's radiation.

            * Please  note,  some  people have been found to be allergic to
              "Paba". If you are one of  those  people,  please test "Paba"
              internally (it is available at most health food  stores  as a
              single nutritional  supplement).  By ingesting a small amount
              before you  begin  to  take   it   daily   as   a   sun-block
              preventative.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

           ** IMPORTANT: IF YOU ARE A DIABETIC YOU CANNOT TAKE PABA. **

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

            "Paba" taken  internally  should be kept in the range of 500 mg
       per day.  This   will   help  to  prevent   skin   irritation   from
       overexposure.

            If you find you must be exposed to solar radiation and can plan
       for it, then begin taking the "PABA" five (5) days before you are to
       be exposed to the sun.

                     vacation at the nudist camp this year!!!!
