                BIOWARFARE RESEARCH CONDUCTED AT U.S. UNIVERSITIES

       Overshadowed by Star   Wars,  the  push  toward  developing  ghastly
       instruments of biological  warfare   has  been  one  of  the  Reagan
       administration's best-kept secrets.

       The research budget for infectious diseases and toxins has increased
       tenfold since fiscal  1981,  and  most  of the 1986  budget  of  $42
       million went to  24  U.S. Universities where the world's most deadly
       organisms are being cultivated in campus labs.

       The large sums  of  military  money   available  for  bio-technology
       research is a  powerful  attraction  for scientists  whose  civilian
       funding resources have dried up.

       Scientists who formerly  researched  diseases  like  cancer  now use
       their talents to develop strains of  such rare pathogens as anthrax,
       Rift Valley fever,   Japanese  encephalitis,  tularemia,   shigella,
       botulin, and Q fever.

       Many members of  the  academic  community  find  the trend alarming.
       However, when MIT's  biology department  voted  to  refuse  Pentagon
       funds for biotech research, the administration forced  it to reverse
       its decision by threatening to cut off other funds.

       In 1987, when the University of Wisconsin hired retired Army Col.
       Philip Sobocinski to   help   professors   attract   Pentagon-funded
       biowarfare research, a UW science  writer was fired after disclosing
       the details in the student newspaper.

       Since the U.S.  signed  the  1972  Biological  and   Toxic   Weapons
       Convention, which bans  "development,  production,  stockpiling, and
       use of microbes  or their poisonous  byproducts  except  in  amounts
       necessary for protective and peaceful research," the university-
       based projects are called defensive efforts aimed at developing
       vaccines and protective gear.

       Scientists who oppose the program insist that a germ-warfare defense
       is clearly impractical;  the  entire  population would  have  to  be
       vaccinated for every known harmful biological agent.

       The only feasible  application  of  a  "defensive" development is in
       conjunction with offensive use: Troops could be effectively

       vaccinated for a single agent prior to launching an attack with it.

       Another issue receiving  even  less  attention  is the safety or the
       security of the labs involved.   Release  of  pathogens,  either  by
       accident or design, would prove tragic.

       Twenty-three U.S. schools, including the Universities of California,
       Connecticut, Georgia, Massachusetts,  Minnesota,   and   Utah,   are
       currently engaged in Bio-Warfare Research.
