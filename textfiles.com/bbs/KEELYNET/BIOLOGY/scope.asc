             New optical microscopes transcend limits of visible light
                                  By John Markoff
                            New York Times News Service

       A new generation  of  optical  microscopes  is  emerging, capable of
       resolving images far  beyond  the  conventional  limits  imposed  by
       visible light.

       These microscopes are   known   as   near-field   scanning   optical
       microscopes, or NSOM,  and  they  may  soon  offer a wide variety of
       remarkable applications ranging from  detailed  movies  of the inner
       workings of cells to vast increases in data storage capacity for the
       computer industry. In theory the technique could pack information so
       densely that two copies of "War and Peace" could be  transcribed  in
       the area of a pinhead.

       The renaissance of  optical  microscopy  is  a  striking reversal of
       recent trends in this three-century-old  technology. Since the 1930s
       conventional lens-based optical microscopes have increasingly lagged
       behind two other  kinds.  One is the electron and X-ray  microscopes
       which resolve at  far  shorter wavelengths than optical systems; the
       other is scanning  probe instruments  which,  in  the  case  of  the
       scanning tunneling microscope, can now routinely resolve  objects as
       tiny as individual atoms.

       Yet despite the  razor-sharp  imaging  ability of nonoptical systems
       they have failed to replace traditional  optical microscopy for many
       applications because of  what  researchers  call a Faustian  bargain
       struck by each  technology.  In both cases compromises must be made.
       There are shortcomings in these powerful  technologies  ranging from
       lack of viewing contrast to the destructiveness of  techniques  that
       destroy biological material.

       Despite its great  promise,  the  new  optical  technique  has  been
       developing slowly because of a variety  of hurdles that are only now
       being overcome.

       Until now near-field  scanning  optical microscopes  have  been  the
       laggards of the  field,  said  Eric Betzig, a physicist at AT&T Bell
       Laboratories who is one of the leading developers of the

                                      Page 1





       instruments.

       That is now  changing  quickly  based  on technical advances made in
       Betzig's laboratory and by researchers at Cornell University and IBM
       scientists in Zurich, Switzerland. Their hope is that the near-field
       optical instruments now being perfected  will  take advantage of the
       decades of experience  gained  with  improving conventional  optical
       microscopes. Betzig said  advantages  like  speed  and  the  ease of
       preparing specimens would enable scientists  to adapt quickly to the
       new technique.

       Betzig's belief in  the field's promise is echoed  by  some  of  the
       leading figures in microscope research.

       "Near-field optical extends   the   limits   to  a  degree  that  is
       unprecedented," said Calvin Quate,  a  Stanford University physicist
       who is a pioneer in developing advanced microscope technologies. "If
       you have two  microscopes of similar resolution, the  optical  would
       win out because of the power of photons."

       Bell Laboratories researchers   have  already  perfected  near-field
       scanning optical microscopes capable  of  resolving  images  down to
       approximately 12 nanometers, or less than one 1,700,000-millionth of
       an inch. This  makes it easy to view objects like bacterial  viruses
       which are in  the  range  of  70  nanometers  across  or  about  one
       360,000th of an inch.

       At the heart of the new technique is an ultra-fine fiber-optic probe
       that can be steered over the surface  of  a  sample  with remarkable
       accuracy while staying within several nanometers of the object's
       surface.

       The probe itself  is  created by heating and drawing  a  fiber-optic
       wire and then  sheering  its  tip. The probe is coated with aluminum
       and a light is shined through it.  As  the probe is scanned over the
       surface of an object, an image is built up line by  line,  much as a
       television image is created.

       The great advantage  of  the new technique is that it evades a basic
       physics principle known as the diffraction  limit,  which holds that
       details that are smaller than half the wavelength of light cannot be
       resolved. The microscope  can  in  fact  resolve  objects  that  are
       dwarfed by the wavelength of light, which is around 500 nanometers.

       To get around  the  diffraction barrier, the new instruments exploit
       the fact that a light wave can be  defined as the sum of a series of
       waves with far shorter wavelengths. Because of the probe's extreme
       proximity to the  surface  it  is  measuring,  it can  detect  these
       "evanescent" waves that are lost at greater distances.

       Several applications for  the  new  breed of optical microscopes are
       now being explored. At Bell Laboratories  Betzig  and his co-workers
       have used the instrument to view extremely thin tissue samples taken
       from the hippocampus of a monkey's brain.

       When it is used together with a conventional optical microscope, the
       viewer can jump back and forth from a wide viewing  area to focusing
       in on extremely  fine  features  that  have  traditionally only been
       accessible to transmission electron microscopes. The Bell research

       suggests that the  new instrument could become a cost-effective tool
       for clinical pathology.  MORE (Optional 2ndtake follows.)

       In the laboratory of Michael S. Isaacson,  a  Cornell  physicist who
       led one of the three groups that originally developed the near-field
       optical microscopes in  the late 1970s and early 1980s,  researchers
       are using the  devices  as  diagnose  semiconductor lasers. With the
       instrument's power, they can understand more precisely problems that
       develop in the process of growing the lasers.

       Despite early promise,   some   significant   hurdles   remain.   In
       biological fields, Isaacson said that the instrument's usefulness is
       narrow so far.

       "The technique may  be restricted to a certain class  of  biological
       objects," he said.  Because  the optical probe functions so close to
       the surface of an object, it may  be  impossible  to navigate across
       cell surfaces that have many protruding receptors. But Isaacson said
       that researchers at the University of Washington had  already  begun
       using a near-field  microscope  to  explore  the structure of muscle
       cells, which generally have smooth surfaces.

       Indeed, the Bell Laboratories researchers,  working  with scientists
       at the Center  for  Light  Microscope  Imaging and Biotechnology  at
       Carnegie Mellon University, have already demonstrated that the near-
       field technique can  obtain  more detailed images of cell structures
       than can other microscopic methods.  The  detailed  cell  images are
       providing new insights  into  the mechanisms of wound  repair,  they
       said.

       They have also  recently  begun  to  view cells under water, a first
       step toward creating  images of living  cells.  It  currently  takes
       about 45 minutes to obtain a 512 by 512 pixel image, far slower than
       some of the  living cell processes. In the future,  however,  Betzig
       said the researchers  believe  that  modifications  to  the  current
       system may make it possible to create several images per second.

       There are also several research projects  under way in nonbiological
       areas. The Cornell Laboratory, in conjunction with IBM, is exploring
       use of the NSOM to write ultra-thin circuit lines on  silicon wafers
       by scanning the  probe  tip  over  a  light-sensitive semiconducting
       material.

       At present electronic  circuits  are  etched  on  semiconductors  by
       shining ultraviolet light  through masks that make  it  possible  to
       expose as many as 30 wafers an hour. Using a single NSOM probe would
       take a prohibitive  amount of time even to write the circuitry for a
       single chip.

       To overcome this barrier scientists  are  discussing the possibility
       of creating arrays of tens of thousands of probes  that  could  scan
       across the surface  of  a  wafer  writing  ultra-dense semiconductor
       circuits.

       "You can fabricate silicon structures  that  are  almost  comparable
       with what you  can do with electron beams," said Isaacson.  "But  in
       order for it to be realistic in a manufacturing sense you would have
       to do it in parallel."

       There may be   intermediate   applications   in   the  semiconductor
       manufacturing process, however. The  Bell  Laboratories  researchers
       are studying using  the  NSOM  tools  as  an inexpensive  means  for
       correcting defects in  the  masks  that are used in the lithographic
       process needed to make microchips.   Potentially it will be possible
       to microscopically "weld"  defects  in  the  delicate  semiconductor
       circuit pattern masks.

       The Bell Laboratories researchers are also exploring the possibility
       of using the  NSOM  as  a device for storing and retrieving computer
       data. Currently they have been able to read and write information at
       densities of 45 billion bits per inch.

       If that much information were in  the  form  of  recorded  music, it
       would take a  disk the size of a quarter as much as  eight  days  to
       play it all.   If  it  took  the  form  of  compressed  high-density
       television programming, a  palm-sized  disk  could  hold  17  hours'
       worth.

       Yet while such densities are more than 40 times greater  than  those
       attained with state-of-the-art  magnetic recording techniques, there
       are competing technologies that may  be  even  more  promising. Last
       year IBM scientists at the company's Almaden Research  Center in San
       Jose used an  atomic  force  microscope  probe in conjunction with a
       laser to store and retrieve data at even higher storage densities.

       It is still early but researchers  are  beginning  to talk about the
       advent of a  golden age in the Lilliputian world of  high-technology
       microscopes.

       "It's a fantastic  time,  its  the  golden  age of microscopy," said
        Kumar Wickramasinghe, manager of  physical  measurements  at  IBM's
       Thomas J. Watson  Research  Center  in Yorktown Heights,  N.Y.  "The
       scanning tunneling microscope  has  taught me and a lot of others in
       this field that  by scanning probes  around  you  can  overcome  the
       limits to resolution.   Now  you're  really  limited   only  by  the
       ingenuity of the  scientist  designing  the  probe. We're all having
       lots of fun."
