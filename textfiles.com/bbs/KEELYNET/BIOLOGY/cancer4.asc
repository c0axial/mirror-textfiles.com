                   Prevention of Cancer by increased Blood Flow

       The first detailed  analysis  of an organ-forming protein, a natural
       chemical that induces the body to  sprout  blood vessels, could open
       new approaches to fighting cancer, heart disease and other ailments,
       researchers say.

       The protein, named  angiogenin,  was  discovered   and   studied  by
       researchers at Harvard  Medical School, who published their findings
       in the latest issue of the journal Biochemistry.  They also isolated
       the gene that oversees production of the protein.

       "It is the first time that a specific substance has been clearly
       related to the creation of a type  of organ," said Dr. Hans Neurath,
       editor of Biochemistry. "That is really a first."

       Cancers secrete angiogenin   --   and   probably   other,   similar,
       substances -- to  promote  the  growth  of tiny blood vessels called
       capillaries. This provides the blood supply that allows the tumor to
       enlarge and eventually spread.

       Some experts theorize that if some way could be found to block
       angiogenin and its chemical cousins, then cancers could be stopped.

       "I would fondly hope that this will  prove  possible," said Dr. Bert
       L.  Vallee, who  directed  the  research.  "I  think   this   should
       facilitate it."

       Experts say the work represents a major step in the study of
       angiogenesis, or blood vessel formation, which was pioneered two
       decades ago by Dr. Judah Folkman, another Harvard researcher.

       "It's a stunning achievement," Folkman said. "I think it's very
       important for the  whole  field,  because it will enlarge everyone's
       thinking about how tumors send the  signal  to  keep  blood  vessels
       growing in toward them."

       Dr. James F. Riordan, another member of the research team, said one
       logical cancer strategy  will be to try to produce  antibodies  that
       will neutralize angiogenin.

       The researchers said they were surprised to find that angiogenin
       holds about a 35 percent similarity to another well-known enzyme

       called ribonuclease. This,  too,  could be turned to their advantage
       in finding ways to defeat the protein.

       Comparing angiogenin to ribonuclease  "gives  us  a  clue  as to its
       three- dimensional structure,"  Riordan  said.   "If  you  know  the
       structure, you can  try  to design drugs that will specifically bind
       to the protein" and deactivate it.

       The blood vessel growth promoters  also  probably  play  a  role  in
       diseases besides cancer. For instance, experts believe that they are
       responsible for the  proliferation of blood vessels  that  leads  to
       blindness in victims of diabetes as well as the overabundance
       of capillaries in rheumatoid arthritis.

       Neurath said it may be possible to use the substance to promote the
       growth of new blood vessels in victims of heart disease.

       Vallee said much more work remains to understand the workings of the
       gene and the chemical it produces.

       "What turns it  on?"  he  said.  "What turns it off? How is it made?
       How is it excreted? It is enough to keep people busy a long time."

       The scientists derived angiogenin  from  a  human  colon  cancer and
       showed that it would promote capillary growth in  chicken  eggs  and
       rabbits.

       Normal tissues also produce similar hormones. They are part of the
       female menstrual cycle and fetal growth in the womb, and they are
       released to repair wounds and heart attacks.

       Folkman said the   angiogenesis  factors  released  by  cancers  are
       probably extremely similar to those produce in the body's day-to-day
       housekeeping.

       "The big difference is timing," said Folkman. "Normal tissues rarely
       put these factors out. They are normally  turned  off. In the tumor,
       they are turned on and stay on continuously."
