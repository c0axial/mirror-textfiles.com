                            THE UNIVERSE AS A HOLOGRAM

           DOES OBJECTIVE REALITY EXIST, OR IS THE UNIVERSE A PHANTASM?

            In 1982  a  remarkable  event took place.  At the University of
       Paris a research team led by physicist  Alain  Aspect performed what
       may turn out to be one of the most important experiments of the 20th
       century.  You did not hear about it on the evening  news.   In fact,
       unless you are  in  the  habit  of  reading  scientific journals you
       probably have never even heard Aspect's  name, though there are some
       who believe his discovery may change the face of science.

            Aspect and his team discovered that under certain circumstances
       subatomic particles such  as  electrons are able to  instantaneously
       communicate with each  other  regardless  of the distance separating
       them.  It doesn't matter whether  they  are  10  feet  or 10 billion
       miles apart.

            Somehow each particle always seems to know what  the  other  is
       doing.  The problem  with  this  feat is that it violates Einstein's
       long-held tenet that no communication  can  travel  faster  than the
       speed of light.  Since  traveling  faster than the speed of light is
       tantamount to breaking the time barrier, this daunting  prospect has
       caused some physicists  to  try  to  come  up with elaborate ways to
       explain away Aspect's findings.  But it has inspired others to offer
       even more radical explanations.

            University  of  London  physicist   David  Bohm,  for  example,
       believes Aspect's findings  imply  that objective reality  does  not
       exist, that despite its apparent solidity the universe is at heart a
       phantasm, a gigantic and splendidly detailed hologram.

            To understand why Bohm makes this startling assertion, one must
       first understand a little about holograms.  A hologram is a three-
       dimensional photograph made with the aid of a laser.

            To make  a  hologram,  the  object  to be photographed is first
       bathed in the light of a laser beam.  Then a second laser beam is
       bounced off the reflected light  of  the  first  and  the  resulting
       interference pattern (the area where the two laser  beams commingle)
       is captured on film.

                                      Page 1





            When the  film  is developed, it looks like a meaningless swirl
       of light and dark lines.  But as  soon  as  the  developed  film  is
       illuminated by another laser beam, a three-dimensional  image of the
       original object appears.

            The three-dimensionality   of  such  images  is  not  the  only
       remarkable characteristic of holograms.   If a hologram of a rose is
       cut in half and then illuminated by a laser, each half will still be
       found to contain the entire image of the rose.

            Indeed, even if the halves are divided again, each snippet of
       film will always be found to contain a smaller but intact version of
       the original image.   Unlike normal  photographs,  every  part  of a
       hologram contains all the information possessed by the whole.

            The "whole in every part" nature of a hologram provides us with
       an entirely new way of understanding organization  and  order.   For
       most of its history, Western science has labored under the bias that
       the best way  to understand a physical phenomenon, whether a frog or
       an atom, is to dissect it and study its respective parts.

            A hologram teaches us that some  things in the universe may not
       lend themselves to this approach.  If we try to take apart something
       constructed holographically, we will not get the pieces  of which it
       is made, we will only get smaller wholes.

            This insight  suggested  to  Bohm  another way of understanding
       Aspect's discovery.  Bohm believes  the  reason  subatomic particles
       are able to  remain  in contact with one another regardless  of  the
       distance separating them  is  not because they are sending some sort
       of mysterious signal back and forth,  but because their separateness
       is an illusion.  He argues that at some deeper level of reality such
       particles are not  individual entities, but are actually  extensions
       of the same fundamental something.

            To enable people to better visualize what he means, Bohm offers
       the following illustration.

            Imagine an  aquarium  containing  a fish. Imagine also that you
       are unable to see the aquarium directly  and your knowledge about it
       and what it contains comes from two television cameras, one directed
       at the aquarium's front and the other directed at its side.

            As you stare at the two television monitors, you  might  assume
       that the fish  on  each of the screens are separate entities.  After
       all, because the cameras are set  at  different  angles, each of the
       images will be  slightly  different.  But as you continue  to  watch
       the two fish,  you  will  eventually  become  aware  that there is a
       certain relationship between them.

            When one turns, the other also  makes  a slightly different but
       corresponding turn; when one faces the front, the other always faces
       toward the side.   If you remain unaware of the full  scope  of  the
       situation, you might   even   conclude   that   the   fish  must  be
       instantaneously communicating with  one another, but this is clearly
       not the case.

            This, says  Bohm,  is precisely what is going  on  between  the
       subatomic particles in Aspect's experiment.

                                      Page 2





            According to  Bohm,  the  apparent faster-than-light connection
       between subatomic particles is really  telling  us  that  there is a
       deeper level of  reality  we  are  not  privy  to,  a  more  complex
       dimension beyond our own that is analogous to the aquarium.  And, he
       adds, we view  objects  such as subatomic particles as separate from
       one another because we are seeing only a portion of their reality.

            Such particles are not separate "parts", but facets of a deeper
       and more underlying  unity that is  ultimately  as  holographic  and
       indivisible as the previously mentioned rose.  And  since everything
       in physical reality  is  comprised of these "eidolons", the universe
       is itself a projection, a hologram.

            In addition to its phantomlike  nature,  such  a universe would
       possess other rather   startling   features.    If    the   apparent
       separateness of subatomic  particles is illusory, it means that at a
       deeper level of reality all things  in  the  universe are infinitely
       interconnected.

            The electrons in a carbon atom in the human brain are connected
       to the subatomic  particles that comprise every salmon  that  swims,
       every heart that beats, and every star that shimmers in the sky.

            Everything interpenetrates   everything,   and  although  human
       nature may seek  to categorize and  pigeonhole  and  subdivide,  the
       various phenomena of  the  universe,  all  apportionments   are   of
       necessity artificial and all of nature is ultimately a seamless web.

            In a  holographic universe, even time and space could no longer
       be viewed as fundamentals.  Because  concepts such as location break
       down in a universe in which nothing is truly separate  from anything
       else, time and  three-dimensional space, like the images of the fish
       on the TV monitors, would also have  to  be viewed as projections of
       this deeper order.

            At its deeper level reality is a sort of superhologram in which
       the past, present,  and  future  all  exist  simultaneously.    This
       suggests that given  the  proper  tools it might even be possible to
       someday reach into the superholographic  level  of reality and pluck
       out scenes from the long-forgotten past.

            What else the superhologram contains is an open-ended question.
       Allowing, for the  sake of argument, that the superhologram  is  the
       matrix that has  given  birth  to everything in our universe, at the
       very least it contains every subatomic  particle  that  has  been or
       will be --  every  configuration  of  matter  and   energy  that  is
       possible, from snowflakes  to  quasars,  from  bluü  whales to gamma
       rays.  It must be seen as a sort of  cosmic  storehouse of "All That
       Is."

            Although Bohm concedes that we have no way of knowing what else
       might lie hidden in the superhologram, he does venture  to  say that
       we have no reason to assume it does not contain more.  Or as he puts
       it, perhaps the  superholographic level of reality is a "mere stage"
       beyond which lies "an infinity of further development".

            Bohm is not the only researcher who has found evidence that the
       universe is a hologram.  Working independently in the field of brain
       research, Standford neurophysiologist Karl Pribram has also become

                                      Page 3





       persuaded of the holographic nature of reality.

            Pribram was drawn to the holographic model by the puzzle of how
       and where memories  are  stored  in the brain.  For decades numerous
       studies have shown that rather than  being  confined  to  a specific
       location, memories are dispersed throughout the brain.

            In a  series  of  landmark  experiments  in  the  1920s,  brain
       scientist Karl Lashley  found that no matter what portion of a rat's
       brain he removed he was unable to  eradicate  its  memory  of how to
       perform complex tasks  it  had learned prior to surgery.   The  only
       problem was that  no  one  was able to come up with a mechanism that
       might explain this curious "whole  in  every  part" nature of memory
       storage.

            Then in the 1960s Pribram encountered the concept of holography
       and realized he had found the explanation brain scientists  had been
       looking  for.  Pribram believes memories are encoded not in neurons,
       or small groupings  of  neurons,  but  in patterns of nerve impulses
       that crisscross the entire brain  in  the  same way that patterns of
       laser light interference crisscross the entire area  of  a  piece of
       film containing a   holographic  image.   In  other  words,  Pribram
       believes the brain is itself a hologram.

            Pribram's theory also explains how the human brain can store so
       many memories in so little space.   It  has  been estimated that the
       human brain has the capacity to memorize something  on  the order of
       10 billion bits of information during the average human lifetime (or
       roughly the same amount of information contained in five sets of the
       Encyclopaedia Britannica).

            Similarly, it  has  been  discovered  that in addition to their
       other capabilities, holograms possess  an  astounding  capacity  for
       information storage--simply by changing the angle at  which  the two
       lasers strike a piece of photographic film, it is possible to record
       many different images on the same surface.  It has been demonstrated
       that one cubic  centimeter  of  film  can hold as many as 10 billion
       bits of information.

            Our uncanny ability to quickly retrieve whatever information we
       need from the  enormous  store   of   our   memories   becomes  more
       understandable if the  brain  functions  according   to  holographic
       principles.  If a  friend  asks  you  to tell him what comes to mind
       when he says the word "zebra", you do not have to clumsily sort backÿ
       through ome gigantic and cerebral  alphabetic  file to arrive at an
       answer.  Instead, associations  like  "striped",  "horselike",   and
       "animal native to Africa" all pop into your head instantly.

            Indeed, one of the most amazing things about the human thinking
       process is that  every  piece  of information seems instantly cross-
       correlated with every other piece  of  information--another  feature
       intrinsic to the hologram.  Because every portion of  a  hologram is
       infinitely interconnected with  ever  other  portion, it is perhaps
       nature's supreme example of a cross-correlated system.

            The storage of memory is not the only neurophysiological puzzle
       that becomes more tractable in light  of Pribram's holographic model
       of the brain.   Another  is how the brain is able to  translate  the
       avalanche of frequencies it receives via the senses (light

                                      Page 4





       frequecies, sound frequencies,  and  so on) into the concrete world
       of our perceptions.

            Encoding and decoding frequencies  is precisely what a hologram
       does best.  Just  as  a  hologram functions as a  sort  of  lens,  a
       translating device able to convert an apparently meaningless blur of
       frequencies into a  coherent  image, Pribram believes the brain also
       comprises a lens and uses holographic  principles  to mathematically
       convert the frequencies  it  receives through he  senses  into  the
       inner world of our perceptions.

            An impressive  body  of  evidence  suggests that the brain uses
       holographic principles to perform its operations.  Pribram's theory,
       in fact, has gained increasing support among neurophysiologists.

            Argentinian-Italian researcher Hugo Zucarelli recently extended
       the holographic model into the world of acoustic phenomena.  Puzzled
       by the fact that humans can locate  the  source  of  sounds  without
       moving their heads, even if they only possess hearing  in  one  ear,
       Zucarelli discovered that  holographic  principles  can explain this
       ability.

            Zucarelli has  also  developed  the  technology  of  holophonic
       sound, a recording  technique able to reproduce acoustic  situations
       with an almost uncanny realism.

            Pribram's belief   that  our  brains  mathematically  construct
       "hard" reality by relying on input  from a frequency domain has also
       received a good deal of experimental support.

            It has  been found that each of our senses is  sensitive  to  a
       much broader range of frequencies than was previously suspected.

            Researchers have  discovered,  for  instance,  that  our visual
       systems are sensitive to sound frequencies,  that our sense of smell
       is in part dependent on what are now called "osmic frequencies", and
       that even the cells in our bodies  are sensitive to a broad range of
       frequencies.  Such findings  suggest  that  it  is   only   in   the
       holographic domain of consciousness that such frequencies are sorted
       out and divided up into conventional perceptions.

            But the  most  mind-boggling  aspect  of  Pribram's holographic
       model of the brain is what happens  when  it  is  put  together with
       Bohm's theory.   For  if  the concreteness of the  world  is  but  a
       secondary reality and what is "there" is actually a holographic blur
       of frequencies,  and  if  the  brain  is  also  a  hologram and only
       selects some of the frequencies out  of this blur and mathematically
       transforms them into sensory perceptions, what becomes  of objective
       reality?

            Put quite  simply, it ceases to exist.  As the religions of the
       East have long upheld, the material  world is Maya, an illusion, and
       although we may  think  we  are  physical  beings moving  through  a
       physical world, this too is an illusion.

            We are  really "receivers" floating through a kaleidoscopic sea
       of frequency, and what we extract  from  this  sea  and transmogrify
       into physical reality is but one channel from many  extracted out of
       the superhologram.

            This striking new picture of reality, the synthesis of Bohm
       and Pribram's views, has come to be called the holographic paradigm,
       and although many scientists have greeted it with skepticism, it has
       galvanized others.  A small but growing group of researchers believe
       it may be  the most accurate model of reality science has arrived at
       thus far.  More than that, some believe it may solve some mysteries
       that have never  before  been  explainable   by   science  and  even
       establish the paranormal as a part of nature.

            Numerous researchers,  including Bohm and Pribram,  have  noted
       that many para-psychological     phenomena    become    much    more
       understandable in terms of the holographic paradigm.

            In a  universe  in  which  individual   brains   are   actually
       indivisible portions of  the  greater  hologram  and  everything  is
       infinitely interconnected, telepathy  may merely be the accessing of
       the holographic level.

            It is obviously much easier to  understand  how information can
       travel from the mind of individual 'A' to that of individual  'B' at
       a far distance  point  and  helps to understand a number of unsolved
       puzzles in psychology.  In particular,   Grof  feels the holographic
       paradigm offers a  model  for  understanding  many of  the  baffling
       phenomena experienced by   individuals   during  altered  states  of
       consciousness.

            In the 1950s, while conducting research into the beliefs of
       LSD as a psychotherapeutic tool,  Grof  had  one  female patient who
       suddenly became convinced she had assumed the identity  of  a female
       of a species  of  prehistoric  reptile.   During  the  course of her
       hallucination, she not only gave  a  richly  detailed description of
       what it felt like to be encapsuled in such a form,  but  noted  that
       the portion of  the  male  of  the  species's anatomy was a patch of
       colored scales on the side of its head.

            What was startling to Grof was  that  although the woman had no
       prior knowledge about such things, a conversation with  a  zoologist
       later confirmed that in certain species of reptiles colored areas on
       the head do  indeed  play  an  important  role as triggers of sexual
       arousal.

            The woman's experience was not  unique.   During  the course of
       his research,  Grof  encountered examples of patients regressing and
       identifying with virtually  every  species on the evolutionary  tree
       (research findings which  helped influence the man-into-ape scene in
       the movie Altered  States).     Moreover,   he   found   that   such
       experiences frequently contained  obscure zoological  details  which
       turned out to be accurate.

            Regressions into  the animal kingdom were not the only puzzling
       psychological phenomena Grof encountered.   He also had patients who
       appeared to tap into some sort of collective or racial  unconscious.
       Individuals with little  or  no  education  suddenly  gave  detailed
       descriptions of Zoroastrian funerary practices and scenes from Hindu
       mythology.  In other  categories  of  experience,  individuals  gave
       persuasive accounts of   out-of-body   journeys,   of   precognitive
       glimpses of the  future,  of  regressions  into  apparent  past-life
       incarnations.


                                      Page 6





            In later  research,  Grof  found  the  same  range of phenomena
       manifested in therapy sessions which  did  not  involve  the  use of
       drugs.  Because the common element in such experiences  appeared  to
       be the transcending  of  an  individual's  consciousness  beyond the
       usual boundaries of ego and/or limitations  of  space and time, Grof
       called such manifestations "transpersonal experiences",  and  in the
       late '60s he   helped   found   a   branch   of   psychology  called
       "transpersonal psychology" devoted entirely to their study.

            Although Grof's  newly  founded  Association  of  Transpersonal
       Psychology garnered a   rapidly   growing   group   of   like-minded
       professionals and has  become  a respected branch of psychology, for
       years neither Grof or any of his  colleagues  were  able  to offer a
       mechanism for explaining  the bizarre psychological  phenomena  they
       were witnessing.  But  that  has  changed  with  the  advent  of the
       holographic paradigm.

            As Grof recently noted, if  the  mind  is  actually  part  of a
       continuum, a labyrinth  that is connected not only  to  every  other
       mind that exists  or  has  existed, but to every atom, organism, and
       region in the vastness of space and time itself, the fact that it is
       able to occasionally  make  forays   into  the  labyrinth  and  have
       transpersonal experiences no longer seems so strange.

            The holographic  prardigm also has implications  for  so-called
       hard sciences like biology.  Keith Floyd, a psychologist at Virginia
       Intermont College, has  pointed  out  that  if  the  concreteness of
       reality is but a holographic illusion, it would no longer be true to
       say the brain produces consciousness.   Rather,  it is consciousness
       that creates the appearance of the brain -- as well as the body and
       everything else around us we interpret as physical.

            Such a turnabout in the way we view biological  structures  has
       caused researchers to  point out that medicine and our understanding
       of the healing process could also  be transformed by the holographic
       paradigm. If the apparent physical structure of the  body  is  but a
       holographic projection of  consciousness, it becomes clear that each
       of us is much more responsible for  our  health than current medical
       wisdom allows.  What we now view as miraculous remissions of disease
       may actually be due to changes in consciousness which in turn effect
       changes in the hologram of the body.

            Similarly, controversial   new  healing  techniques   such   as
       visualization may work  so well because in the holographic domain of
       thought images are ultimately as real as "reality".

            Even visions and experiences  involving  "non-ordinary" reality
       become explainable under  the  holographic paradigm.   In  his  book
       "Gifts of Unknown  Things,"  biologist  Lyall  Watson  discribes his
       encounter with an  Indonesian shaman  woman  who,  by  performing  a
       ritual dance, was  able to make an entire grove of  trees  instantly
       vanish into thin  air.   Watson  relates  that  as  he  and  another
       astonished onlooker continued to  watch  the  woman,  she caused the
       trees to reappear, then "click" off again and on again several times
       in succession.

            Although current  scientific  understanding  is   incapable  of
       explaining such events, experiences like this become more tenable if
       "hard" reality is only a holographic projection.

            Perhaps we agree on what is "there" or "not there" because what
       we call consensus reality is formulated and ratified at the level of
       the human unconscious    at   which   all   minds   are   infinitely
       interconnected.

            If this is true, it is the most  profound  implication  of  the
       holographic paradigm of all,  for it means that experiences  such as
       Watson's are not commonplace only because we have not programmed our
       minds with the  beliefs  that  would make them so.  In a holographic
       universe there are no limits to the extent to which we can alter the
       fabric of reality.

            What we perceive as reality is  only a canvas waiting for us to
       draw upon it  any  picture  we  want.   Anything is  possible,  from
       bending spoons with  the  power  of  the  mind to the phantasmagoric
       events experienced by Castaneda during his encounters with the Yaqui
       brujo don Juan,  for  magic  is our  birthright,  no  more  or  less
       miraculous than our ability to compute the reality  we  want when we
       are in our dreams.

            Indeed, even  our most fundamental notions about reality become
       suspect, for in a holographic universe,  as Pribram has pointed out,
       even random events  would  have to be seen as based  on  holographic
       principles and therefore  determined.  Synchronicities or meaningful
       coincidences suddenly makes sense,  and  everything in reality would
       have to be seen as a metaphor, for even the most haphazard events
       would express some underlying symmetry.

            Whether Bohm   and   Pribram's  holographic  paradigm   becomes
       accepted in science or dies an ignoble death remains to be seen, but
       it is safe  to  say  that  it  has  already  had an influence on the
       thinking of many scientists.  And  even  if  it  is  found  that the
       holographic model does  not  provide  the best explanation  for  the
       instantaneous communications that  seem to be passing back and forth
       between subatomic particles, at the  very  least,  as noted by Basil
       Hiley, a physicist  at Birbeck College in London, Aspect's  findings
       "indicate that we  must  be prepared to consider radically new views
       of reality".

            This is one of the most fascinating files we have seen since it
            seems to offer a hypothesis which  "synthesizes" a multitude of
            phenomena including  that  generally  classed as  "paranormal."
