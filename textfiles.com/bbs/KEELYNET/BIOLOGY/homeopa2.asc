The following information is an article written by Dr. J. Benveniste to Peter
Kelly and Peter's response to Dr. Benveniste.  We don't have the circuit that
is mentioned YET but hope to get it and place it online in the future.  In the
meantime, you can see the references to a scalar approach that allows energy
to be 'programmed' to influence matter....>>>  Jerry

                             When its Becomes True
                          by Jacques Benveniste, M.D.
                     Director of Research, INSERM, France
                                 June 22, 1994

I am often asked the question; what will be the consequences of your work if
your results are shown to be true?  My response is at first epistemological
and then technological.

The history of science teaches us that a discovery does not "exist" until it
has survived two tests:

   1)  Facts, which are most often - though not always, especially at the
       beginning - reproducible, must be displayed, if possible within the
       context of existing theories.  When the latter is NOT the case, the
       situation is very difficult as it is necessary to change theories, an
       exercise repugnant to scientists.  Consider Galileo, Pasteur, Newton,
       Einstein, Bohr, Planck...

   2)  The Scientific "Community" must accept these results.  This is becoming
       more and more difficult, with science being true to the destiny of all
       human enterprises in its becoming increasingly structured and rigid.
       Contray to what the public IS LED to think, technological progress is
       accelerating while scientific progress slows down.  For example, even
       though we have acquired detailed knowledge and control over SOME
       cellular processes, we are still VERY FAR from a satisfactory
       understanding of cellular functioning.

In our research, we are at stage one.  After perhaps one or one-and-a half
THOUSAND experiments, we think we have discovered the nature of MOLECULAR
COMMUNICATION: it is via electromagnetic (EM) fields (comparable to radio
transmitter/receiver waves) which are RELAYED BY WATER MOLECULES. Or, rather,
we are at stage one-and-a-half: we are no longer alone.

A university research group from Montpelier has just reported a high dilution
effect in an international journal; another group, from a pharmaceutical
company, has published results identical to those we obtained five years ago.
(Quotidien du medecin, 16 Dec 93 and 14 Feb 94); Erwin Heintz published, in
1962, similar results in the Comptes-Rendus de l'Academie des Sciences; two
other university research groups, in Paris and in Bordeaux, are preparing
reports on analogous facts observed in other systems; the director of an
INSERM research unit, who is so afraid that he swore me to secrecy, has kept
comparable results under lock and key since 1988; five European groups,
including three from universities, presented similar results at congresses of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science (Boston, August, 1993)
and Experimental Biology (Los Angels, April, 1994); the scientific literature
of the highest level contains numerous articles where the dilution is such
that there is less than one molecule PER CELL, where the effect is thus NOT
MOLECULAR IN NATURE; a delegation of INSERM commission n<198>5 observed the
experimental EM transmission of molecular information (see below) in our
laboratory and reported: "this experiment does not contradict the results
announced by Benveniste"; Georges Charpark, the Nobel Laureate in Physics, was
intrigued enough to suggest a collaboration on this subject between his school
and INSERM....the latter refused.

Despite all this, this factual truth might well not be admitted immediately;
it could, as has happened in the past, remain buried for ten, twenty, thirty
years, before re-emerging AS IT MUST.

Twenty eight years had to pass before acceptance of Loewi's 1920 discovery of
the chemical nature of nerve-synaptic transmission, today one of the
FUNDAMENTAL tenets of physiology.

In fact, the explanation of these mysteries is simple: the molecular signal,
the precise nature of which we ignore (we do not EVEN ASK THE QUESTION), would
appear to be composed of SPECIFIC EM frequencies which can only communicate
with the EM field THAT CO-RESONATES WITH THEM, as is the case for the radio
receiver-transmitter couple.

This EM information is transferred and CAN BE AMPLIFIED by POLARIZED WATER
DIPOLES (minute magnets capable of orienting themselves in an EM field) which
FORM A COCOON around EACH biological molecule.

The molecular structure would thus appear to provide a supporting structure
for oscillating ELECTRIC CHARGES which emit, thus, a SPECIFIC RADIO-ELECTRIC
FIELD.

THE REALITY OF THE EM NATURE OF THE MOLECULAR SIGNAL IS DEMONSTRATED BY THE
TRANSFER, BY STRICTLY EM MEANS, OF THE ACTIVITY OF SIMPLE AND COMPLEX
MOLECULES TO VIALS OF WATER, A VERITABLE LIQUID RECORDING TAPE, OR TO CELLS IN
CULTURE, A TRANSFER WHICH WE HAVE PRACTISED IN OUR LABORATORY FOR TWO YEARS,
NOW, IN THE COURSE OF SEVERAL HUNDRED BLIND AND OPEN EXPERIMENTS (Faseb J.,
1994 8:A398).

This is not the least HERETICAL (the emission of specific frequencies BY
MOLECULES is one of science's classical phenomena), but calls for some
theoretical progress in physics, seemingly already made by quantum physicists,
who, in passing, attempt to explain how molecules of water (a gas mixture
liquid at room temperature!) stay together.  And this no more denies either
the existence or role of molecules than the recording of a voice or a visual
image denies that of the larynx of the body.

All this will, sooner or later, become "true".  Then the EM transmission of
biological information will transform our everyday life.  The molecular
message, that is the EM expression of the NATURAL molecules which make our
bodies work, as well as that of drugs, those natural and synthetic molecules
which regulate (sometimes) the body's dysfunctioning, will be dealt with as
sound and image are today.

It will be numerized, recorded, transported and the potential for detecting
normal and abnormal molecular functioning both in vivo and in vitro, will
provide us with substantial means for intervention.

For example, a simple apparatus, capable of analyzing physiological constants,
and LINKED BY PHONE OR CABLE to a central computer, will be found in homes and
also in vehicles where it will MONITOR the physiological state of the driver;
administration of therapeutic activities via the same means; remote detection
of simple and complex pollution; antennas broadcasting pesticidal frequencies
and this at the level of entire continents in, for example, the struggle with
parasites, and with ABSOLUTE SPECIFICITY and without chemical pollution...It
can be predicted that a substantial part of the traffic on future's
"information freeways" will be BIOLOGICAL INFORMATION.

At such a level of utopia (which, we are told, is denied to scientists but the
right to which I demand when it is informed by facts) there are a good many
reasons for confining the dreamer responsible to a mental asylum, a fate which
has already been suggested as apt to myself.  In my defense, I would say only
this: he (or she, let's not be sexist) who invented the wheel invented the
Formula 1 (racecar).  And, closer to ourselves, Graham Bell, in carrying the
human voice from one room to another, knew very well that one day it would be
from continent to continent and this despite the sarcastic remarks of his
contemparies for whom the telephone was a mere toy.

Similar incomprehension and sarcasm notwithstanding, we transmit, on a daily
basis, the specific activity of simple and complex molecules USING COILS of
electrical wire and a simple amplifier.

We send this information either to water, which stocks it (records it) before
retransmitting it, or DIRECTLY to cells whose metabolism is thereby PROFOUNDLY
CHANGED.

This is experimentally and scientifically true.  When it becomes
institutionally true, the rest will follow.  For we cannot escape this truism;
if the activity of a molecule can be transported in this way, it is because it
is EM IN NATURE and thus susceptible, through the application of EXISTING
technology, to the treatment I have described.

In order that these utopias cease to be no more than just that, audacity,
fairness and a genuine desire for progress are and always will be necessary in
science, that is IN SCIENTISTS.

This is hardly the case in our society increasingly threatened by hand-out
NORMS, which pursues its collapse into lazy CONSENSUS and covert CONFORMISM,
and pays LIP SERVICE to democracy while flirting with its opposite.

For my part, and that of my colleagues at INSERM U 200 (now closed for
HERESY), somewhat puzzled by the years of INDIFFERENCE and of vicious and
senseless attacks on our professional competence and even integrity, but still
obliged to carry on BY OUR RESULTS, that have up to now never been seriously
challenged by any SOLID HYPOTHESIS, it is these fundamental values (and also
FUNDS) that we find most lacking.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is a letter written by Peter supporting and confirming Dr.
Benveniste's results...

Dear Dr. Benveniste:

   It was with great pleasure that I received your note today, referencing our
mutual friend of Scotland, and of course the synopsis of your milestone work
in the field we call POTENTIZATION.

   I am enclosing several papers that are published of our work.  To summarize
briefly:

   We have been working in this area for almost 25 years, since the latter
part of 1969, when, as a young electrical engineer, I was presented
information that insects were being killed by "broadcasting" their "death" to
their fellow insects at a distance of several hundred kilometers.

   Since that time, we have uncovered a lot of the principles involved in
radionics/psychotronics, and the engineering to MAKE THEM WORK, including full
scale challenges from our Medical Field and their Federal watchdogs, the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration in early 1986.  (you mentioned HERESY...)

   What we have found is this:  ALL animate and inanimate objects in this
"three-dimensional reality" are basically composed of two things....

    The "energy-as-information" which DEFINES WHAT THEY ARE,
    and the "magnetic" field which HOLDS IT IN PLACE.

   We define these forces as "summed scalar potentials" of quantum charge and
find that this explanation is specifically in line within the field of Quantum
Physics, as quantum electrodynamics, and follows all the "rules" as are known
at present.

   Besides being involved in the training of close to 10,000 individuals,
medical professional, agricultural and dairy farmers, the people we have
trained, and ourselves have done innumerable research projects where we have
satisfied our own curiosity in regards to the "workings" of the nature of
reality, and the "mechanisms" for the hows and whys of many things AS THEY
ARE.

   All of the people we have trained either have our small "agricultural"
analyzer, our large "Experimental" agricultural analyzer, and/or our various
potentizers, which as you have found, are capable of transferring the
"pattern" of "information" from one material to another.  We have even found
that this can be detectable at the "gross" level, such as transferring the
"hotness" or "bite" from the herb cayenne pepper to ordinary water.

   Besides this, we found that one can specifically "tune" to the specific
"disease" of an individual, or animal or field and "identify" the information
of that specific disease, produce a potentization in accord with strict
homeopathic principles (in-phase information) and provide it to the human,
animal, agricultural field, and be virtually assured of a "cure" medically or
agriculturally....OR and...I think this is even more significant...broadcast
an out-of-phase "treatment" of the pathogen (or whatever) in question and
achieve the same results.

   Anyway, I am enclosing some of the papers that I have done over the years,
as well as packets of information that we use as handouts.  I hope that this
will help you with the work you are doing.  Specifically, with the gaining of
acceptance by the so-called "traditional" scientists that seem to be more of a
plague than a benefit on their parts.  It is interesting to note that we have
reached a point where antibiotics and vaccines and the like are no longer
having the fabled successes that they did in the past, because we feel that
the earth's magnetic field is weakening, exponentially, and the information
that makes the bacteria and viruses what they are, is mutating very rapidly
and traditional medicine and science no longer has the mechanism to "keep up"
with their changes.

   Soon, very soon, the work of individuals such as yourself, myself, and
others will be absolutely critical to all of mankind, if for no other reasons,
than to prevent the grand plagues, such as already seem to be building,
worldwide.

   Good luck, and if there is any other information you would like, or if you
get to the United States, please do not hesitate to look us up.  Perhaps you
would consider a trip with our mutual friend during the latter part of this
year.

                                                             Sincerely,
                                                             Peter J. Kelly
                                                             President

P.S.  The key to doing all of this is a combination of two things:

   1)  Tricking the magnetic component of "reality" into NOT BEING THERE for a
       moment in time....pulsed OPPOSING EM fields WILL ACHIEVE THIS.

   2)  And, as you are finding....amplified fields to TRANSFER "energy-as-
       information" of whatever it is you are trying to transfer.  Your
       circuit diagram is virtually identical to our amplifier portion of our
       devices.  Bravo! Bravo! BRAVO!

Vanguard Note

  Be aware that scalars occur as nested modulations consisting of many
  frequencies.  It can be thought of three dimensionally as an onion, since
  oscillation occurs across the diamter of a mass, the larger diameter skins
  are lower frequencies and the internal 'skins' are higher frequencies
  because they are shorter wavelengths.

  All structures thus have a gross fundamental frequency, determined by its
  outer diameter, and every component which comprises the mass aggregate also
  has their own frequencies.  This is how the onion skin is built up.  Refer
  to the file NEUTRAL1 on KeelyNet and the Tetractys to see how this works.

  These two documents provide major keys to a better understanding of scalar
  generation and applications.

Subject: waves
Folder : A, "Public Mail"

Hello, KeelyNetters!

I heard a broadcast on Tom Valentine's Radio Free America last month on 5810
with Neal (Neil?) Girardo (Gerardo?) that blew my mind! (Now on 5065 in the
"tropical band...)

Tom interviewed Neal and George Bowen (Bowin?) in the 2nd hour about their
"MRX" device, which kills virii with resonant energy in the optical
wavelengths.  They use lasers to break the bonds between toxins and healthy
tissue, and they can focus "to a pinpoint."

Girardo International (somewhere in Florida) claims their MRX locks onto
molecular emission frequencies of the offending molecule (!) and responds with
a blast of synchronized energy that destroys it.

Impressive stuff, if they really have it!  But why didn't Valentine give us
any contact info?  He didn't take any phone calls, either.

My questions:

1. Is this a "Rife-type" technology: shaking the beast to bits?

2. Who's got a grip on Girardo and his Company:  What's Up?
   Phone?  Fax?  Internet?  Too Busy?

3. Why do some folks play games at a time like this?

I understand Bob Dratch's MES (Molecular Emission Scanner) has the capability
to not only look at, but also do X-Y plots of frequency bandwidths vs.
amplitude in the millimeter-wave range.  How does this fit with your
knowledge?

Does Gerardo acknowledge?  I'll swap info anytime.  OK?

The Russians have significant work in this area too; their patents are in the
area of Auras.  I can provide references, 93 & 94.  They seem to (too) have
discovered mm-waves, but the info is elusive.  Let's toss it open for
discussion.....

We have monthly meetings here in Dallas, called the 'Vanguard Sciences
Roundtable' where a group of our friends and Associates meet to eat, exchange
information and discuss the latest information we each encounter during the
past month.  There are always visitors, sometimes from out of state or out of
the US.  If we are lucky, they provide us with additional information they are
aware of.

At this last months meeting (VSRT1194.ASC), we brought Steve's email and
read it to see if anyone had heard of it or had additional information.  I
love this phrase, IT JUST SO HAPPENS, one of our people, Dan Haley, had
visited with Neal Gerardo just last week in Florida.  Dan has information on
the system and provided the following verbal account;

Gerardo's system is similar to a magnetic resonance scanner.  It uses optical
energy to build up photons in diseased cells.  The purpose is to break the
molecular bond.  The technology is based on scanning systems developed for SDI
and used commercially to detect ripeness in fruit through changes in molecular
emissions.

A computer drives the scanner and can run through a full range of frequencies
to determine the type of disase.  The laser is adjusted to match the disease
signature.  Once the signature is determined, a matching signature consisting
of modulated photons are projected into the tissue to cause it to break up.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rick Sheppard did seminal proofs of this several years ago, based on Royal
Rifes work and which RIck videotaped.  The tape shows 'critters' such as
paramecia living in stagnant water that swell and expand to rupture ONLY at
certain frequencies.  A variable audio oscillator was used to drive the
transducer feeding the solution on the microscope slide.  You could clearly
see the critters become very agitated when you reached their frequency.

Once it was determined which gave the strongest reaction, that frequency was
amplified and the critter would swell as if breathing until it popped.  What I
found interesting was that it would swell slightly, but would never shrink as
in a full breath cycle where you have a 1:1 ratio.  Once the outer membrane
ruptured, all the insides leaked out and the thing was dead.  The same as
singing into a wine glass at its resonant frequency until it shatters.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are other devices that claim to use such signatures to alter the
structure of matter.  The SE-5 is a computer that is claimed to be a radionic
device capable of analyzing and treating matter, living or otherwise.  The
Morse Water Purification system was supposed to use molecular emission
techniques also, details on KeelyNet as MORSE1.ASC.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As to Bob Dratch, I met him at one of Dean Stoniers' Global Sciences
Conferences in Denver several years ago.  At that time, Bob was promoting a
new discovery he had made that allowed you to derive a quantitative number for
pain measurement.  Pain, being a subjective thing, is very difficult to
'prove'.  His device used a microwave horn that was passed over the body.  The
output signal was audio and produced various frequencies as it was moved over
the body.  When a pain area was encountered, the machine would scream with a
high pitch.

A random audience member was selected and brought to the stage.  When the
machine passed over her shoulder area, it screamed.  The woman was asked if
she felt pain in that area and she said yes.  She had participated in some
kinesiology (muscle testing to determine system vitality) the night before and
both arms were sore.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A point of interest here, a friend (Cheyenne Turner) and I went to see a
Filipino psychic healer named ROMI a few years back.  I had heard this fellow
could remove diseased tissue, etc. using psychic means.  Not that I knowingly
had any diseased tissue (except maybe for my brain), but it would prove
interesting to see it removed should it prove necessary. The price was $50.

Since ROMI had been involved in legal problems relating to his 'treatments',
they were given at one of his supporters homes far outside Dallas.  We drove
out there and were shown some videotape of ROMI scanning people with his
hands, opening up their skin like a zipper, pulling out a chunk of tissue and
closing the skin.  Blood was present, but once the skin was closed, the blood
was wiped off, showing no scar.  The patient was watching and in no pain
during and after the 'operation.'

When it came time for us, we were taken to separate rooms and instructed to
disrobe down to no clothes.  An assistant came in and rubbed me down with
alcohol.  After waiting for about 10 minutes, ROMI came in and passed a white
terry cloth towel back and forth over my body while looking into the towel
with great concentration.

I asked him what he saw and he told me the alcohol excited the skin to enhance
the glow of the aura.  Since the aura was a field energy, it takes the form of
layers of different colors and densities.  The towel was moved in and out of
my field, which allowed him to see the various layers against the whiteness of
the towel.  He said I had nothing wrong with me, but might have a gastric
problem in the future.  Last year (1993) I had a gall bladder removed due to
inflammation.  Nothing else so far.

Speaking with his various assistants, I asked what they did with the removed
'diseased' tissue.  They said it was flushed down the toilet.  I explained
that it should be available for analysis. They said the tissue was never given
back to the patient, because it represented a psychic manifestation of the
problem and to keep it would mean the problem would come back.

A few weeks later, a chiropractor friend of Cheyenne (George) went to see
ROMI.  He had a problem with one knee but did not tell the healer.  He was
wearing shorts.  ROMI found something wrong with the knee, opened the skin,
pulled out a chunk of flesh and closed up the skin again, all without pain or
discomfort.  He would not let George have the tissue.  George did not realize
the blood on his shorts could be analyzed as to being human or not until after
his wife had washed the blood out of the shorts.

The point here is that the subjects feel no pain.  ROMI said that an energy
like a vibration allows him to open the tissue up without pain.  On
considering this, it becomes apparent that pain is a direct result of cellular
rupture.  If you can vibrate something at the correct frequency (or complex of
frequencies) you could open the skin like a zipper and without pain.  The Dr.
Who series on channel 13 has a surgical knife that uses this principle of
vibration to separate tissue.

You can see correlations not only with Dratch's pain scanner but also with the
molecular emissions to explode disease tissues.  It also ties in with Shrameks
aura viewing technique using a Tesla coil (AURAVIEW.ZIP on KeelyNet).  The
microwave frequencies interact with the bodies frequencies to show dark and
light areas, thus indicating energy imbalances where disease can manifest if
the energy body is not corrected.

All this is based on microwave emissions on a molecular level and how
diagnostic and surgical medicine as well as pain could all be impacted by
accelerating such research or projects.....>>>  Jerry
