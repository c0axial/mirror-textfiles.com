       A  few  notes  about  caution  in  working  with  Enhanced Resonance
       Devices...

       Having read and (hopefully) absorbed over 1.5MB of data concerning
       over-unity  and  ZPE  related  devices,  and  having  a  substantial
       background in electronics, including HVAC, I have a few thoughts to
       share regarding the safety of the experimenter.

       All of these devices rely on resonance of one form or another.
       Resonance can be destructive, regardless of whether the source is
       mechanical/audio, magnetic or electrical.  We're all familiar with
       the demonstration of the tuning fork shattering the crystal glass,
       simply by resonant audio stress.  Human organs can likewise be
       shattered  by  mechanical  vibrations  of  adequate  frequency  and
       amplitude.  Should you create resonance in, for example, a heart
       chamber, fibrillation can occur.

       Over and over, resonance is cited in the theory of operation in
       free-energy devices.  The text file CLEM1.ASC, included with the
       CLEM1.GIF file, uses Tesla's theory of resonant frequencies to
       describe the operation of the cooking oil engine.  Two things come
       to mind:

                 1.        Stability of the machine is compromised at
                           resonance, just like with the crystal glass.  I
                           believe that this may be part of the reason for
                           the engine failure in Clem's demonstration.

                 2.        Cooking oil has a flash point...an experimenter
                           should be aware of this, as the normal operating
                           mode of the motor is thermal runaway, limited by
                           the efficiency of the heat exchanger, which will
                           degrade over time.

       Using 600Hz to extract hydrogen from water seems safe enough,
       PROVIDED that you are trained in capturing and compressing hydrogen.
       Enough car batteries have exploded for all of us to be aware of the
       nature of hydrogen.

       The  Tesla  coil  itself,  while  amazing  to  watch,  is  typically
       operating well above the voltage range where x-rays are generated.
       Mammography machines use 25KV-30KV to x-ray soft tissue.  Unshielded

                                      Page 1

       x-ray is known to cause, among other things, cancer, cataracts,
       sterility, arthriris in the appendages, etc.  That's why the most
       dangerous part of a CRT is in the back, where the flyback (Tesla)
       coil is located.

       Nuff' said?  Hardly!

       Working  with  x-ray,  I've  personally  seen  autotransformers with
       shorted windings of heavy copper wire.  The short of adjacent
       windings creates a circulating current of 1000+Amps, from 20Amps
       input!  As these windings self-destruct, which is a matter of
       seconds, the autotransformer (which was lifted into place with a
       fork lift), actually jumped into the air.  An energy blast occurs,
       which can burn anyone standing too close, provided that they aren't
       hit by the transformer.

       Should your Tesla fail in the same mode, you will also be releasing
       scalar energy, the effects of which are not thoroughly understood.

       Early  researchers  into  other  forms  of  energy  have discovered,
       sometimes the hard way, of the true power of their products, ala the
       Curies.  Experimenters in resonance based devices should be aware
       that little or nothing is known regarding the long, or even short
       term effects of these devices on living tissue...and at the least,
       avoid  resonating  ANYTHING  at  peak,  where  it  ultimately  self-
       destructs.

       There are stories about Tesla sitting on a park bench, watching the
       pigeons and taking notes.  It is said that he believed that the
       pigeons were aliens, sent to watch him, so he was studying and
       "telepathing" with them.  True or not?  Who knows?  But perhaps he
       was over the limit of his brain to absorb scalar energy, resulting
       is some scrambled neurons.  Since the brain emits scalar waves,
       perhaps Tesla had resonated it once too often.

       As you may be wondering by now, I'm building a Tesla coil.  However,
       I'm taking the added precaution of shielding it with copper plated
       steel, solidly grounded.  I still can't define the penumbra of the
       beam, so I can't be absolutely sure of the shield's benefit, but
       it's something, anyway.  Odds are, it will be a little safer for me
       and my family by using the shield.

       My opinion is that, before building an experimental ZPE project,
       learn as much as you can about the stress factors, thermal dynamics,
       and flash point of any and all of the components in the project
       design.  Shield yourself, as best you can, and if possible, use some
       form of monitoring device to be sure that you aren't flooding
       yourself with any ionizing energy.  Ionized cells, whether from
       solar radiation or any other power source, can become cancerous.

       Avoid devices which distort space-time.  Yes, the information is
       available to build them, but a sudden power outage can collapse YOU
       or anything else in the warp field.  And, I doubt if you will
       receive posthumous credit for your "discovery".

       Anything else?  Oh yeah...

       I saw a researcher on the FOX network program "Sightings", who had
       compared the diameter of crop circles, and found that all of the

                                      Page 2

       different sizes are related to each other in terms of the diatonic
       scale, i.e. harmonically resonant.  Therefore, I assume that many of
       the theories regarding Enhanced Resonance Devices are basically
       accurate.  It would make sense that the size of a device would be in
       sync with the resonant frequency of the power source, or some
       harmonic thereof.  This also leads me to believe that there is an
       optimum  frequency  relative  to  gravity  and  scalar  effects, and
       therein lies the rub...to sustain this frequency, at power levels
       adequate to achieve buoyancy, without super-conductive substrates,
       could cause violent molecular disintegration, similar to the crystal
       glass.

       Please feel free to take exception to anything I've said in this
       file.  If you disagree, leave me a message and tell me why.  My hope
       is that, should you decide to work in the field of ZPE, that you
       will find it to be both safe and rewarding.
