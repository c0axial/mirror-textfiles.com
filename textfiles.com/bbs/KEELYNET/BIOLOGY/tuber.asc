                       NEW TUBERCULOSIS "EPIDEMIC" SPREADING

                          By Clark Staten, EMT-Paramedic

       Chicago, IL.  A  new and virulent form of tuberculosis has struck as
       many as thirteen (13) states, including  Illinois.  The states named
       by the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) include;  New York, New
       Jersey, Alabama, California,   Texas,  Arizona,  Georgia,  Virginia,
       Washington, Pennsylvania, Florida, Hawaii, and Illinois.

       This new mutant  form  of  tuberculosis   is  proving  resistant  to
       standard antibiotic treatments  that  have been used  for  years  to
       treat the disease.  According the CDC officials, they requested that
       representatives of as  many  as  forty-eight  (48)  states come to a
       recent two day meeting to attempt  to  develop  strategies to combat
       the new strain of bacteria.

       Public health reports have been received that multiple  outbreaks of
       the deadly new  form  of the virus have already occurred in at least
       five states, with  eight others reporting  one  case  of  the  newly
       mutated form.  Reportedly, thirty-one (31) other  states  have  also
       reported higher than   normal   numbers  of  the  standard  form  of
       tuberculosis.  Several health officials have also expressed concerns
       that they do not have adequate data  on the actual number of victims
       of the new strain, in order to determine the true extent of
       the threat.

       Tuberculosis, like many  other  virus-type diseases,  is  spread  by
       "droplet dispersion", when  the  infected patient coughs or sneezes.
       Contact with the infected body fluids  has  been  shown  to  be  the
       primary route of  introduction  to  the  disease.  Health  care  and
       emergency workers seem   to   be   those   at   greatest  risk  from
       tuberculosis, due to the fact they  are  often  called upon to be in
       close contact with the victims.

       The latest lethal strain of the disease also seems to have been most
       often reported when   associated   with   those   with   the   Human
       Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).  Researchers  say  that it is possible
       that those with  a  compromised   immune  system  may  be  the  most
       susceptible to this new form of the disease, and  that  is  why they
       are being diagnosed at the onset of this outbreak.

       Doctors at the Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, New York, have reported
       the latest large  outbreak  of  the  disease.   Out of thirteen (13)
       patients diagnosed with the drug-resistant  virus,  eleven (11) have
       died.  In the New York outbreak, however, researchers point out that
       85% of the patient that expired also had tested positive for HIV.

       Doctors report that some patients, infected with the drug-resistant
       form of tuberculosis,  can  be cured with early multiple  antibiotic
       intervention.  They say  that  early diagnosis and treatment seem to
       be most important factors in the eventual  survival  of the infected
       patients. CDC experts, however, report that they do not at this time
       have sufficient data  to  determine the overall mortality  rate  for
       exposures to drug resistant tuberculosis.

       Dr. Dixie Snider,  CDC's  top tuberculosis expert, reportedly issued
       the following statement;  "At  no   time   in   recent  history  has
       tuberculosis been of  such  concern  as  it  is  now.  .  .  because
       tuberculosis is out  of control in this country".  President Bush is
       expected to acknowledge  the  growing  threat  of  this  disease  by
       announcing increased funding   for   tuberculosis   prevention   and
       research programs in the Health & Human Service's 1992-1993 budget.
