                 SHEILA SNOW EXPLORES THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING
                        THE FAMOUS CANCER FORMULA, 'ESSIAC'

          Controversy  and  intrigue  still  continue  to  shroud  Essiac,
       striking a chord of anxiety in the hearts of the seriously ill who
       have staked their lives and expectations on the promise of its
       healing properties.  Yet its clandestine quality gave the remedy its
       power.  Had its secrets been revealed early in its long history,
       would it have made such an impact on the lives of many Canadians?
       For those new to the story of Essiac, here is a brief summary to
       date.
           Rene Caisse was a Canadian nurse who was born in Bracebridge,
       Ontario, in 1888.  While working in a norhtern Ontario hospital in
       1922, she noticed the scarred but healed breast of an elderly
       patient and questioned her about it.  Some years earlier a Toronto
       doctor had diagnosed the breast to be malignant and a mastectomy was
       recommended.  Instead, the woman accepted the offer of a herbal tea
       prepared by an Indian neighbour believed to be of the Ojibwa tribe,
       also known as Chippewa- The nurse asked for and received the Indian
       herbal remedy which she later modified.  That professional curiosity
       began a quest that was to last until her death at the age of ninety
       in December, 1978.  Her life became one of turmoil and frustration,
       joy  and  high  hopes  followed  by  bitter  disillusionment, much
       adulation and reverence by patients who recovered, and endless
       questioning by sceptics and some members of the medical profession.

            When Rene's aunt, after using her remedy for two years, fully
       recovered from an inoperable stomch cancer with liver involvement
       two years later with her remedy and other terminal patients also
       began to improve, physicians put their signatures on two petitions
       (1926  and  1936)  requesting  that  Nurse  Caisse,  be  given the
       opportunity to treat cancer cases in a larger way. Both were tumed
       down by Ottawa's Department of Health and Welfare.  But word of
       Essiac's medicinal virtues kept spreading.  Dr. Frederick Benting,
       hailed as the discoverer of insulin, offered her access to is
       laboratories at the Universitv of Toronto for animal studies if she

                                      Page 1





       would temporarily give up her practice at the Bracebridge clinic.
       She rejected his offer because the lives of her patients depended on
       Essiac. Even the Ontario government became involved in 1938 when a
       bill was introduced to legalize Essiac as a remedy to treat terminal
       cancer patients, but in a close decision the legislature turned it
       down by three votes.  Today the spirit of this magnanimous lady
       still lives on with many questions left unanswered about the recipe
       she perfected and called 'Essiac' , simply by reversing her maiden
       name 'Caisse'.

       THE SECRET FORMULA

            Rene never wanted the general public to know what ingredients
       were in the formula or how to prepare it.  Her main concerns were
       that they would make it incorrectly and that exploiters, once
       apprised of the herbs in it, would put out specious facsimiles that
       lacked the healing properties of Essiac.  She feared that the very
       simplicity of the remedy would cause many persons to question its
       ability to alleviate or cure such a formidable disease.

            Perhaps this is why she was persuaded to hand over her beloved
       Essiac to the Resperin Corporation in 1977 for the sum of $1.00.
       This group, which includes several physicians on its board of
       directors, may have been her last hope of convincing the Canadian
       government to set up trial studies on terminal cancer patients
       across the country.  The studies would be properly documented with
       authentic diagnoses as well as detailed reports about the progress
       of the patients.  Her dream of having Essiac recognized as a
       legitimate cancer therapy would then be fulfilled, while proof of
       its efficacy would permit the Resperin group to successfully market
       it.

            Unfortunately, this has not yet occurred.  Cancer patients may
       still obtain the decoction from Resprerin's Dr. Hugh Wilson who
       lives in Orillia, Ontario, by having their doctors submit written
       requests through Health and Welfare Canada.  However, during the
       years since Rene's passing, some doctors have failed to turn over
       their patients reports so Resperin has fallen behind in keeping up
       with its records.  Only word-of-mouth accounts and hearsay evidence
       portray improvement and some recoveries, while a number of dying
       patients spoke of reduced pain with little or no need of pain-
       killers, a sense of peace and a clear mind.  Thus belief in Essiac
       remains alive.

            Soon after Rene's death a new product emerged on Essiac scene
       called 'Easy-Ac' , a decoction made by Gilbert Elondin of Hull,
       Quebec.  In 1977 he watched his wife, mother of three young
       children, recover from a lymphosarcorma three months after she began
       taking Essiac directly from the nurse.  Today she is still free of
       cancer and her family devoutly believes in the remedy.  When Rene
       refused  any  offer  of  financial  remuneration  from  Gilbert,  he
       returned to paint her living quarters and do some necessary repairs
       on the house which had been neglected because of her more pressing
       preoccupation with patients.  Few if any people had ever offered
       help of this kind and the nurse was touched hi generosity. A bond of
       trust formed between them and some believe she may have taught him
       how to prepare the recipe for his wife in order to forgo the
       extensive travelling to Bracebridge every second weekend.


                                      Page 2





       THE COURT CASE

            As word spread of his wife's recovery, people came to Gilbert
       for help, and when demand for his product increased, he quit his
       trade to work full time making the decoction.  In due course he
       filed dutifully for a Drug Identification Number (D.I.N.) from
       Health and Welfare Canada but was told that since Easy-Ac was
       considered to be a food, there would be no need of a D. I. N. In
       1988, however, health inspectors closed down his small operation and
       filed a suit against his company for advertising Easy-Ac as a cancer
       remedy and for failing to obtain a D.I.N.  Apparently the health
       department felt that if it cured anything, it should be labelled a
       drug.  After two years in court, Easy-Ac was considered by thejudge
       to be a food, and some slight charges and small fines were assessed.

           While this court case was going on, something else was also
       taking place that was to make Essiac a household word again in both
       the United States and Canada.  In 1988 Dr. Gary L. Glum, a
       chiropractor  in  Los  Angeles,  Califomia,  rekindled  interest  by
       publishing a book titled, 'Calling of an Angel', termed "the true
       story of Rene Caissc and an Indian herbal medicine called Essiac.  "
       It updated the article published by Toronto's Homemaker Magazine in
       1977 'Could Essiac Halt Cancer?' 'Throughout his work Dr. Glum
       asserts the authenticity of the formula and in a special video
       details what he claims to be the Essiac recipe.  From the large
       amount this dried herbal mixture produces, we believe it is the
       recipe Rene used in, the 1930's when she prepared the remedy in her
       Bracebridge clinic for hundreds of patients and quite conceivably
       the one passed along to the Resperin corporation for its clinical
       studies.

            We owe a large debt of gratitude to Dr. Glum for having the
       courage to take on this enormous responsibility -no small task!-at
       great personal financial expense, time and energy.  It would be
       impossible for anyone bent upon revealing the Essiac recipe to
       imagine beforehand just what kind of reactions it might stir up.
       Presenting it to the world at long last has been like opening
       'Pandora's Box'.  Whether it will be a blessing or a curse remains
       to be seen.

       DR. GLUM'S RECIPE

            The four main components of Dr. Glum's recipe are:
          1) 1 lb. (16 oz. by scale weight) of powdered Sheep's Sorrel
             (Rumex acetosella).  This is a wild perenial miniature of
             garden sorrel.  It must be green in colour and have an aroma
             of sweet grass.
          2)  6 1/2 cups (52 oz. in a kitchen measuring cup) of cut Burdock
             Root (Arctium lappa). This should weigh about 1 1/2 lbs. if it
             is quality material gathered from the first year roots of this
             biennial.  Fresh burdock toot has a distinct aroma.
          3) 1/2 cup (4 oz. by scale weight) of the Slippery Elm inner bark
             (Ulmus fulva), also in powdered form.  It is best to purchase
             this because the novice could kill a tree by stripping off
             bark carelessly in the spring.  Sometimes the commercial
             product is adulterated with inferior flour or other starchy
             substances which create a gravy-like decoction, so beware.
             The powder should be light beige.
          4) 1 oz. of Turkey Rhubarb Root (Rheum palmatum).  This must

                                      Page 3





             be purchased because its natural habitat is in China and
             Tibet.  Rene preferred this variety to the common rhubarb
             because its medicinal properties were stronger and the taste
             less bitter.  It is yellowish-brown in colour.

       QUESTIONS ABOUT ESSIAC

            Numerous interpretations of this recipe being passed around are
       raising rumours, doubts, and questions which always seem to surface
       when anything unorthodox is introduced.  I will try to clear up some
       of these with the following questions and answers, but do so with
       considerable trepidation as, no doubt, my answers will spark even
       more questions.

            Q: How can we be sure that Dr. Glum's recipe is the correct
       one?
            A: The four herbs in Dr. Glum's recipe are also present in
       Essiac.  Rene often emphasized in the 1970's that only four herbs
       were being used and this today is still the decoction that continues
       to help people.  Rene's motto, which her patients firmly believe in,
       was, "If it works, don't change it."
            Q: How much Essiac can be made out of the entire dried mixture?
            A: Remember, as stated before, this amount was for a large-
       scale production to treat hundreds of patients in a short period of
       time.  One might want to experiment by with one quarter of this
       recipe.  Once the herbs are mixed well, the kitchen measuring cup
       can be used to find out just how many eight-ounce cupfuls are in the
       mixture.  Each decoction makes up at least twelve 16-oz. bottles of
       Essiac. One quarter of the dried recipe should provide an eighteen
       month supply for one person if he were to take one ounce of Essiac
       every single night.  Powdered herbs tend to lose their medicinal
       properties faster than cut or whole plants so it is wise to
       replenish your stock every year when possible.
            Q: Do we weigh the eight ounces of dried mixed herbs on a
       scale?
            A: No. Rene only used a kitchen measuring cup and filled it up
       to eight ounce line.  If this amount were measured on the scale the
       decoction would be much stronger.
            Q: Is the herb being sold today as Sheep's Sorrel a substitute?
            A. The samples I have received from many outlets in Ontario and
       the  United  States  appear  to  be  an  inferior  quality  of an
       undetermined herb which may or may not be related to the Sorrel
       family.  Since this is the primary herb in Essiac, one must become
       thoroughly acquainted with its appearance, aroma and taste.
            Q: Are Dr. Glum's directions for taking Essiac correct?
            A: Dr. Glum obtained his directions from a physician who
       treated patients with Essiac under close supervision, so the dose is
       stronger than the one Rene recommended.  Here are her instructions:
            1)  Take one ounce of Essiac with two ounces of hot water every
       second day at bedtime, on an empty stomach two or three hours after
       supper.
            2)  Do not eat or drink anything for at least one hour after
       taking Essiac.
            3)  Continue the treatment every other day for thirty-two days,
       then take the treatment every three days.
            4)  Always keep Essiac refrigerated but never in the freezer.

            For the novice this is a trial and error experience; nobody
       becomes a cook overnight.  It should not be attempted when a life-

                                      Page 4





       threatening situation is involved because the desperate run to any
       available source for herbs they may know nothing about.  The
       complete mixture is sold in many stores but how can one tell if the
       powdered herbs are correct and of good quality, or how old they are
       or if the amounts of each are accurate? Why waste precious energy,
       time, money and even the mixture itself if it proves to be inferior?

            The routine for making the recipe may be simplified with
       practice.  Understand that no two decoctions are exactly alike as
       any chemist will confirm. Don't be concerned about the number of
       bottles you get out of each decoction because various things affect
       the amount of liquid that will be absorbed by the herbs. Rene used
       one quart (32 oz.) of local spring water. (Never use treated tap
       water!) for one ounce of mixed herbs (measured in the kitchen cup,
       remember?) Once people are comfortable about cooking this brew, they
       may want to harvest the Sheep Sorrel plant and Burdock Root.

       MANY BELIEVE ESSIAC HAS HELPED THEM

            Essiac is not a hoax or a fraud.  To hear experiences described
       by the patients themselves cannot help but convince observers that
       dramatic and beneficial changes definitely took place in many but
       not all of those who received the remedy.  Although the focus on
       Essiac has been as a cancer treatment,  it alleviated and sometimes
       cured many chronic and degenerative conditions because it cleanses
       the blood as well as the liver and strengthens the immune system.
       It will continue to remain controversial until opened-minded an
       dedicated scientists and even lay researchers unveil and explore the
       unknow essences that create Essiac's healing magic.

       ABOUT SHEILA SNOW

            Sheila Snow has devoted much of her life to an investigation of
       the Essiac formula.  Recently she was invited by the Consumer Health
       Organization of Canada to address its annual convention in Toronto
       on this topic.  She has now prepared a small book for the layperson:
       The Essence of Essiace.  Publication is expected later this year.

       CLOSE-UP ON THE ESSIAC CONSTITUENTS

            Of the four plants which were purportedly suggested by the
       Ojibwa  Indians  to  Rene  Caisse,  only  two,  Arctium  lappa and
       Ulmus_fulva have any recorded use by the Native people anywhere in
       North America.  In fact, they are the only two indigenous plants.
       Rene must have added Rumex acetosella and Rhewn palmatum on her own
       initiative.

            Arctium  lappa  has  a  well  established  tradition  on many
       continents for use as a depurative or 'bloodcleanser'. Mills calls
       it 'a general alterative remedy appearing to exert a cleansing
       effect on the tissues as such' and being a 'diuretic and mild
       laxative'.  In moderm herbal practice, it is used primarily as a
       dermatological remedy, said to 'move the body towards a state of
       integration  and  health,  removing  such  indicators  of  systemic
       imbalance as skin problems and dandruff. (Hoffman) A poultice is
       also applied to wounds and ulcers.

            But because of its action as a bitter, there is certainly
       stimulation of the digestive system and of the liver. James Duke

                                      Page 5





       records Shemluck's contention that the Chippewa used the root of
       Arctium as a, 'blood medicine' and Virgil Vogel notes that the
       Ojibwa used the root as an anodyne, stomachic and tonic.

            The native use of Ulmus fulva as a poultice for hard tumours
       and swellings was observed by Samuel Stearns and recorded by Virgil
       Vogel.(2)

             There is also some mention of its use in spitting blood from
       the lungs.  This is, of course, a sign of one form of cancer.
       However, according to the BHP, Ulmus is a demulcent, emollient,
       nutritive and antitussive and although it is specifically indicated
       for gastric and duodenal ulcers because of these soothing qualities,
       one can see little reason to assume that it would have much more
       than an palliative action in a cancerous state.

            Rumex acetosema is a European alien 'traditionally used for
       fevers, scurvy and inflamaution. The fresh leaves poulticed (after
       roasting) were used for tumors, -and wens (sabacious cysts).  The
       leaf tea was considered a folk remedy for cancer, according to Duke.
       3 There is, however, no modern scientific evidence of this and its
       use by modern herbal medicine is virtually unknown.  Due to its high
       oxalic acid content, this species should be avoided if one is
       suffering from arthritis or kidney disease.  (McIntyre)

            Rheum palmatum Radix contains anthraquinone glycosides and
       sennosides which act as laxatives and, in larger doses, purgatives.
       In China, Rhubarb is an important ingredient in many prescriptions
       to treat high fevers.  According to McIntyre, it should be avoided
       by persons suffering from arthritis, kidney disease or urinary
       problems and during pregnancy.  It is likely to be of benefit for
       someone suffering from constipation, which is a common complaint
       among cancer patients.

            Given these actions, it is not impossible to accept that such a
       combination might have some benefit for some people suffering from
       some types of cancer.  And there is certainly little reason to
       believe that, if taken according to the originator's instructions,
       there is much possibility of harm or injury resulting.

       TREATING THE WHOLE PERSON

            However, any 'formula' for cancer makes a mockery of modern
       scientific phytotherapy. Research has moved forward a long way since
       Bracebridge,,e in 1922.  We now know that cancer patients, even if
       taking chemotherapy or radiotherapy, can benefit enormously from
       herbal treatment.  There are many more efficient herbs to help the
       liver cast off accumulated toxins.  We now know of plants capable of
       boosting the immune system, plants which have been shown to inhibit
       metastases, plants which have an anti-tumoral effect and still other
       plants which work directly as cleansers for the lymphatic system.
       The danger of limiting oneself to a single 'formula' to treat cancer
       is this: there are many forms of cancer and they affect 'the body
       and its systems in many different ways.  By receiving personal
       attention from a trained professional herbalist, there is a much
       greater probability that appropriate herbs can be chosen which are
       especially suited to the particular sufferer.  Moreover, the wholis-
       tic herbalist is committed to looking beneath the symptoms, to
       correcting the faulty or destructive diet or lifestyle which

                                      Page 6





       underlies the body's final protest, to working with the patient in
       all aspects of his mental and spiritual struggle: in short, to treat
       the person as a whole, not the disease entity.  Because of our
       obsession with a formula, we may well have overlooked this aspect of
       Rene Caisse's work.  K.S.

       I just received a package of mixed herbs and a sheet of instructions
       for preparing Essiac.  It was from:   Auburn Nutrition Center, Inc.
                                             13112 Lincoln Way
                                             Auburn, California 95603

       They have a catalogue, which I was told about but have not seen.
