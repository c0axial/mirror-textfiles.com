               The Original Concept of the Regeneration History
                        with interesting Correlations

  In the early 70's, I (Jerry Decker) first encountered a book "Design for
  Destiny" by Edward  W.  Russell.   This  book  discussed the work of Dr.
  Harold S. Burr  regarding  the Electrodynamic  Field  Theory  of  living
  organisms.

  Essentially, it stated   that  a  majority  of  body  tissues   replaced
  themselves at least  once every 6 months.  This meant that a totally new
  body "grew" and incorporated all the  previous  patterns  as well as all
  patterns to which  it  was exposed over the last 6 month  period.   This
  included stress, sickness and physical injuries.

  As time progressed and the body aged, the intensity of the most recent
  afflicting pattern would  diminish  yet  would leave a physical trace in
  the form of disease, scar tissue or organ dysfunction.

  Each cell was alledged to maintain a perfect pattern of all past
  conditions for each 6 month period.

  It was my belief at that time, that the use of a "Radionic" type device,
  inspired by Dr. T. Galen Heironymous  and  his  wondrous  black  box,  a
  desired pattern could  be recalled and holographically  stored  for  re-
  projection onto the body.  The natural field intensity would be overcome
  by a stronger superimposed signal which would force the cells to take on
  the form of the earlier pattern.

  Thus, if you liked the way your body functioned and appeared at the age
  of 26, you  could  Radionically  tune to that pattern (rate), encode the
  rate onto some form of recording system  and  impose  it  on the body to
  overcome the current aged pattern with the 26 year old pattern.

  For that reason,  in  1976 I came to Dallas to pursue  an  education  in
  Electronics to attempt  to  understand  the technology which would allow
  the practical application of such a system.

  Years later, I met Mary and Dean Hardy, authors of "Pyramid Energy
  Explained".  We became friends and had many fascinating discussions on
  many topics.

  On explaining the Electrodynamic Field Theory and how I intended to use
  it for regeneration of tissue, Mary asked if I had ever heard of a book
  entitled "The Lost Millenium".  She said that much of what I was saying
  was in the book.

  I ordered it through InterDimensional Sciences, PO BOX 167 Lakemont, GA
  30552 (Peter Kelly's group).

  On receiving the book, I immediately read it.  "Lost Millenium" offered
  the possibility that in times past Jehovah (a biologist) had perfected a
  technique which involved 30 minutes of intense meditation each night.



                                    Page 1







  This meditation allowed him to "purify" his Electrodynamic Field of any
  stresses which could become manifest as disease or symptoms of aging.

  He immediately slept for a full nights rest which enabled a perfect
  DNA/RNA replication during the sleep period.

  If this was done each night, over time his body would optimize to a
  maximum healthy pattern and sustain it as long as he performed the
  meditation exercise.

  Eventually all cells  would  come  under  the  dominion  of  the healthy
  pattern but would need periodic prompting  via  the  inductive  field to
  maintain it.

  According to the book, other investigators of Jehovah's time believed
  that only chemical injections could cause cellular regeneration.

  As a result   of  their  experiments,  many  hideous  experiments   were
  performed which caused entire organs to sprout indiscriminately from the
  test subjects.

  During Jehovah's time,  there  was  no  knowledge  of the Electrodynamic
  Field Theory which  we  know to determine  the  differentiation  of  all
  structures in the body.

  In the Russell book "Design for Destiny", the discovery of the L-field
  (L=life) by Dr.  Harold  S.   Burr  is  described.   Mr.   Russell  also
  postulates the existence of a secondary field, the T-field (T=thought).

  This T-field controls the L-field, while the L-field actually controls
  the differentiation and organization of all body components.

  An interesting tie-in is in the Huna philosophy.  Huna teaches that a
  person is composed of a trinity, the Low, Middle and High Self.

  The Low self  is  the  controller  of  the  body  and  is experienced as
  emotion.

  The Low self also is not so bright and must be cajoled into carrying out
  the wishes of the Middle self (which represents your consciousness).

  Energy for the life process as well  as  an  occasional boost for use in
  the performing of what are deemed miracles, is channeled directly to the
  Low self from the High self.

  Since thought controls emotion, then sustained thought can control the
  pattern which tissues will take as they are grown within the field.

  If the concept of the meditation of Jehovah is valid, perhaps a direct
  link with the Low self can actually be accomplished  to  smooth  out all
  the little problems  which  build  up  to distort the linear flow of the
  Life Field.

  As the cells grow in this field, so are they influenced to record any
  distortions.

  It is much akin to placing sticks in a straight flow of water.  The
  sticks create eddy currents or whirlpools which manifest as distortions
  in the flow of the water.

  Just so can emotions manifest as disease in the body.  (Refer to RFP.001
  on the work of Keely on differentiation)

  Ernst Chladni (pronounced shladnee) developed the technique now known as
  Chladni waveplates.  These are simply membranes which are stretched and
  supported over a frame.

  When sand or powder is spread over the membrane and the membrane is
  excited with an acoustic pressure wave, a very clear 2 dimensional
  pattern of the wave is shown.

  This is a key method which Keely used in his development of analytical
  equipment.

  Current terminology for this technique is Cymatics which is being
  researched England by Dr. Peter Guy Manners.  This work is in turn based
  on the late Dr. Hans Jenny of Switzerland.

  The point about Chladni waveplates is that a vibrating structure always
  has a central point from which the vibration is generated.

  Standing waves are set up much as a stone thrown in a pond will send out
  ripples which expand to the limit of the water enclosure.

  The inverse square law determines the extent and ever decreasing
  magnitude of the wave as it moves farther from the source.

  T. B. Pawlicki,  in  his  book,  "How  to  Build  a Flying Saucer" has a
  chapter which shows an interesting diagram of the solar system.

  The sun is shown as the main point  of  vibration  in  our  solar system
  while the planets orbit in the tracks created from the  standing  waves.
  The standing waves  in  turn  are  modulated  by  waves which propel the
  planets around the orbital track.

  The businessman Maurice Cooke of Canada channels an entity known as
  "Hilarion".  This channel generates some of the most interesting science
  related information yet seen from a source of this nature.

  "Hilarion" is the Ray which the Theosophists claim carries all
  information of a scientific nature.

  Hilarion claims that Protons are pin  sized  holes  in the fabric of the
  4th dimension  which  rupture to allow energy to flow  in  a  compressed
  form into the  3rd  dimension.   This is the energy we percieve as light
  and radiant matter.

  Electrons are the regrouping of this force to flow through another
  pinhole back into the 4th dimension.

  This pinhole can  apparently move around  the  modulated  standing  wave
  which encircles the vibrating point of a Chladni waveplate.

  The flow of energy between the Protons and Electrons is what we measure
  as the electrical field.

  In a videotape of the UFO contact case known as the "Meier Chronicles",
  mention is made  of  circular  patterns  which are sometimes left at the
  site of a UFO landing.

  In this particular case, there are  3  circular  projections  left  in a
  field of grass.   The grass was noted to swirl in a CCW  pattern  as  if
  under the impress of a powerful wind.

  The interesting point   of  this  is  the  observation  that  the  grass
  continued to grow in a swirling pattern  for  months  after the landing.
  In a later  contact  with  one  of  the  ship inhabitants,  Billy  Meier
  inquired why the  grass  continued to grow this way although the landing
  was several months old.

  The answer was,  "the  intense  counter-clockwise   anti-gravity   field
  overcomes the Earth field to force the grass to grow in a CCW pattern".

  As time passes, the CCW field will eventually fade away to allow the
  Earth field to once again take over the growth pattern of the grass and
  it will grow straight again.

  It is difficult to understand how a relatively illiterate and very poor
  farmer could come  up  with  something  which ties in to  Electrodynamic
  Field Theory.

  There are other  fascinating  aspects  of  this  case  which  lend  some
  credence to the  possibility  of a higher  contact.   We  recommend  the
  viewing of the  tape  known  as  the Meier Chronicles.  (available  from
  Genesis III)

  In our research, we have found indications from several other sources
  that the anti-gravity effect is indeed a counter-clockwise flow.  Again,
  how could this man know such a thing with such limited contacts?

  We have found what little we know to be a product of much study and
  deliberation.

  Another interesting observation from our researches into anti-gravity is
  an account mentioned by Alexandra David-Neel in "Magic and Mystery in
  Tibet".

  The authoress was travelling by horseback over the mountains of Tibet in
  the early 1900's.   As  they  came  to  the  top  of  a mountain pass, a
  wondrous sight in the form of a monk leaping high into the air came into
  view.

  The monk appeared to leap about 50 feet for each jump.  Ms.  Neel was
  startled and excitedly asked who he was and how he did that.

  The guide informed Ms. Neel that this monk was a Lung-Gom-Pa
  (sleepwalking monk).  The function of the Lung-Gom-Pa was to act as
  messengers from one monastery to another over the rugged mountainous
  terrain of Tibet.


                                    Page 4







  He explained that the monk acheived a certain order of meditation which
  allowed him to  adjust  the  amount  of gravity to which he was subject,
  thus was his effective weight adjusted.

  As we have come to understand gravity, it is similar to a wind which
  blows toward the Neutral Centre (again Keely) of all masses with a
  velocity proportional to the size of the Neutral centre opening.

  Obviously, the larger the mass, the  greater  the  Aetheric flow towards
  its Neutral centre.

  This means that we are all blown toward the center of the Earth rather
  than sucked by the force of gravity.

  If a plate could be placed above our heads which could deflect this
  "Aetheric wind", then we would float up to the plate.

  Thus, the monks had learned how to control the amount of "Aetheric wind"
  which struck their  body  so  that  they could control  their  effective
  "weight".

  On first reading this in the early 70's, it seemed rather far-fetched
  UNTIL I READ THE NEXT PASSAGE.  It stated that Ms. Neel on her further
  travels in Tibet, encountered and befriended many high lamas, who shared
  many secrets with her.

  While staying at one of these lamaseries, Ms. Neel noted the presence of
  certain aged men who had heavy chains draped around their shoulders.

  On asking why  they  subjected  themselves  to such punishment, the lama
  said that these men were at one time members of the Lung-Gom-Pa AND THAT
  THE CHAINS KEPT THEM FROM FLOATING AWAY INTO SPACE.

  Apparently over the years of daily "weight" reduction, the practitioners
  of Lung-Gom-Pa had a majority of their body cells "re-programmed".

  This "re-programming" caused the Neutral Centre of each cell grown under
  the reduced weight pattern to weigh nothing or next to nothing.

  This is exactly the same phenomenon as in the CCW growth of grass in the
  Meier case.

  This simple statement regarding the older Lung-Gom-Pa NAILED ME TO THE
  FLOOR!

  How could Tibetan lamas be aware of this Electrodynamic Field years
  before Dr. Burr did the definitive research beginning in the early 30's?

  The continual growth of the DNA/RNA under the impress of a field which
  polarized the cells in such a manner as to deflect the "Aetheric wind"
  would cause each cell replication to "think" that it should only weigh
  what was desired by the sustained desire of the subject.

  This "cellular recording" phenomena is also present in the Meier grass
  observation and indicates that the cells of all living things LITERALLY
  record patterns which  are  in  ascendance   at   the  moment  of  their
  formation.

                                    Page 5







  Thus, disease propagates disease, aging propagates aging.  The work of
  Burr (Electrodynamics) and Sheldrake (Morphogenetic Fields) is verified.

  A sustained field   with  the  proper  characteristics  would  literally
  entrain all DNA/RNA replications grown under the impress of the field to
  "record" the pattern in control during the time of tissue formation.

  It is much like striking a tuning fork and listening as the vibrations
  slowly die away.   So  would  the  cells  "peak"  out  and  continue  to
  replicate in successively  weakening patterns until the  next  sustained
  exposure to the desired field.

  A friend in California (Bill Strauss) received an early copy of this
  paper and came up with the idea to attempt to record a radionic "rate"
  for the different body energies in effect during the different stages of
  life.

  Bill recently told me that his first effort yielded two rates, 63.64 and
  83.13.

  If this technique  works,  then  radionic  bombardment  might  allow the
  projection of a regenerative field  onto  the  natural  body  field on a
  constant basis if  a machine could be automatically "swept"  to  produce
  the field.

  The work of Backster and Gurwitsch show that cells removed from the body
  continue to communicate over any distance with their original host body.

  Cells could be  kept  alive  in  a  solution  which  was  bombarded by a
  radionic device tuned to the desired regeneration frequency.

  The hydrogen bond dissolution would not be affected by such subtle
  energies and might radically out-perform other modalities due to their
  direct kinship to the Electrodynamic Field.

               ** Thanks to Bill Strauss for his suggestion! **
