       The following is  taken  from  an interview with Ed Sopcak which was
       reprinted in the magazine "Nexus" Vol 2, No 17, December '93-January
       '94. The article was a reprint from  Sovereign Scribe Magazine, vol.
       1, no. 31.

       Ed Sopcak has a product called Cancell, which, providing the patient
       is no longer  under  the  stressful  condition which  precluded  the
       disease, cures the  cancer,  and  AIDS,  and most other diseases for
       that matter.

       It was tested by the FDA and they  verified  this,  as  a  matter of
       fact. Per the article, The FDA has gotten a federal court injunction
       against Ed to not distribute the cure, even for free!  So  there you
       go! That proves  it! If the FDA says it works and THEN prohibits its
       distribution, why, it must work!

       Interview between Soveriegn Scribe (SS) and Ed Sopcak (ES)

       SS: What exactly is the cause of cancer?

       ES: It is  a  mutation of an anaerobic  cell.  So  where  does  that
           anaerobic cell  come from? There are basically  two  sources  of
           them.  One  is  if  you eat any fat or oil that carries a lot of
           free radicals. The free radicals  affect  the  nucleic acids and
           will reproduce themselves in a damaged state. Free  radicals are
           in any  partially  hydrogenated things such as margarine, Crisco
           or all the oils on the shelves.  Also  most  baked  goods have a
           partially hydrogenated oil in them. This is the  basic  cause of
           an anaerobic cell.
           Another thing is if you eat protein. Protein digestion is a two-
           stage process  in  the  body.  At  the end of the first stage of
           digestion you will have a DNA  chemical  or  frequency that will
           damage the nucleic acid, and unless you have an  adequate supply
           of vitamin B6 within the system you don't complete the digestion
           of protein.  Therefore  you  will damage those nucleic acids and
           you will have the production of  cells  in a damaged state. When
           they are  damaged  enough, when they are sitting  in  a  voltage
           range of  between a negative .17 volts and a negative .21 volts,
           and when you have in the system  a bacteria that's classified as
           a progenitor crypto-cyden, then that will facilitate  the change
           of an aerobic cell to an anaerobic cell. Once you have anaerobic
           cells in the body those cells will create energy. You do come up

                                      Page 1

           with ATP  but  it's  in a different form or ratio. When the body
           recognizes that you're coming  in  with  a  different ratio, why
           then the function of the body is to circle the  wagon to protect
           itself.
           This is  where  all  the  degenerative  diseases  occur, such as
           arthritis, lupus, diabetes, M.S., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's etc.
           They will stay there and create  all  kinds of mischief. Now if,
           at the  same  time, some place along the line  the  body  has  a
           chronic demand   for  energy  that  is  greater  than  the  cell
           structure is programmed to deliver, the body answers that demand
           for energy by mutating the anaerobic  cells.  Since the mutation
           of an  anaerobic cell is cancer, that's the cause.  Usually  the
           chronic demand for energy here is stress.
           Over the  past  10  years I've spoken to over 40,000 people with
           cancer. Almost universally, at least 90% of the time you can say
           to a person diagnosed with cancer,  "Within  6 months to 3 years
           ago, you went through a stressful situation. What  was it?" They
           always then  say,  "Well  how  did  you know that?" It is almost
           chiselled in stone that that is the case.

       SS: This leads us to the approach taken by people like Dr. Bernie
           Seigal who say that cancer is related to one's attitude.

       ES: He is correct. Now when I used to answer the phone about 4 hours
           a day, volunteers have since taken over this for me, but I could
           tell simply  by talking to the  person  with  a  95%  degree  of
           accuracy whether CanCell could be used successfully  for them or
           not.
           A person  who  takes CanCell and has cancer and is still staying
           in a stressful situation, CanCell  won't  affect  them at all. A
           person who  is uptight and refuses to relinquish  their  stress,
           there's a problem there.

       SS: Getting into a preventative approach, do free radical scavengers
           like vitamin E and SOD work?

       ES: They sure  do.  Any  of the anitoxidants such as the B vitamins.
           Vitamin C, the water soluble one, and vitamin E, the oil soluble
           one, do work. The mineral is selenium.  I  don't personally take
           supplements of any type. I don't believe God put  me  here to be
           popping pills  so  I don't take things like that. But in general
           if you got your diet back to as  much  raw fruits and vegetables
           and nuts  and minimally cooked foods, and if you  did  that  and
           stayed away  from  animal  products,  I  think  you'd  be  a lot
           healthier.
