         Have you ever gone a conference an collect a bunch of papers.
    Then you bring home all that STUFF!   Then saying to yourself that
    one day I'll  read  that  STUFF or do something with it. Of course
    you have and than you toss it into  a  box  that  you have marked,
    STUFF TO READ SOMEDAY.  Well, last week I was moving  some  things
    around and found a box with a bunch of papers that I had collected
    from several conferences.    Some  of them look like they might be
    good articles for the KeelyNet BBS.

         This is one such article on Ozone. There will be several more
    articles to follow in the next few  weeks.   Now you can down load
    this off the  BBS and make a hard copy and put it  into  your  box
    marked STUFF!

                             OZONE STOPS AIDS

           Ozone Blood Treatment Cures Aids Victims In Germany.
                          No Mention in US Media

         Dr. Horst  Keif  is curing AIDS victims in the Munich area of
    West Germany, by hyper-oxygenating  their  blood with ozone, which
    destroys the AIDS virus on contact. The same basic process appears
    to be also effective against hepatitis, herpes, the  Epstein  Barr
    Virus and the  cytomegalovirus,  as  well  as  providing  a simple
    method of purifying stored blood  and  blood  components, and pre-
    oxygenating blood to be transfused.   Some of the  medical uses of
    ozone have been appreciated for years in Europe and elsewhere, but
    it's still relatively unknown in the US.

         The treatment  itself  is  remarkably  simple.   The ozone is
    produced by forcing oxygen through  a  metal  tube carrying a 300-
    volt charge.   A  pint  of  blood  is drawn from the  patient  and
    placed in an  infusion bottle.   The ozone is then forced into the
    bottle and thoroughly mixed in by  shaking  gently,  whereupon the
    blood turns bright cardinal red.   As the ozone molecules dissolve
    into the blood  they  give  up their third oxygen atom,  releasing
    considerable energy which  inactivates  all lipid-envelope viruses
    while leaving blood cells unharmed.

         Ozone overcomes  AIDS  virus  by  a  fundamentally  different
    process than usually attempted with drugs.   Instead  of burdening
    the liver and  immune system with more elaborate toxic substances,
    ozone simply oxidizes the molecules  in  the  shell  of the virus,
    rendering it incapable of spreading.

         It also  oxygenates  the blood to a greater  degree  than  is
    usually reached, what with poor air and sluggish breathing habits.
    The treated blood  is  then  given  back  to  the patient.    This
    treatment is given from twice a week  to twice a day, depending on
    how advanced the disease is.   The strengthened blood confers some
    of its virucidal properties to the rest of the patient's  blood as
    it disperses.

         The disease will not return, as long as the patient maintains
    his blood in  an  oxygen-positive state, through proper breathing,
    exercise, and clean diet.

         The major  US  news  sources   and   most   of   the  medical
    establishment seems to   be  ignoring  this  line   of   research.
    Meanwhile hundreds of  millions are being spent to "try and find a
    cure", which supposedly won't be  available  for  years,  if ever.
    Once AIDS is diagnosed, "it means death" insists AMA president Dr.
    John J. Coury.  "There  is  no cure...and no immunization."  (Mtry
    Herald 2/27/87)

         He also  mentioned that each case brings the medical industry
    another $40,000 to $150,000, or 40  to 150 million bucks off every
    thousand victims.   Of course, that's totally unconnected with the
    AMA's silence about the AIDS cases cured with ozone.

         Apparently the lone exception to the medical  establishment's
    overall disinterest in  this  promising  breakthrough,  is the FDA
    approval of the Medizone Company's tests on ozone blood treatment.
    The NY-based company  obtained an  IND  (Investigative  New  Drug)
    Approval for ozone, which falls under the heading  of  drugs  even
    though it isn't.     Their  recently  completed  animal tests have
    demonstrated no indication  of   toxicity,   at   ten   times  the
    equivalent amount that is proposed for human treatment.

         Medizone was granted US Patent # 4,632,980  on  December  30,
    1986, on "inactivating  lipid-envelope  viruses  in  blood that is
    returned to a mammalian host."    In  humans,  this includes AIDS,
    herpes, hepatitis,   Epstein   Barr  virus,  and  cytomegalovirus.
    Medizone now has  FDA  approval  to begin human testing around the
    end of April 1987.

         All this has been with virtually  no  publicity,  because the
    accepted procedure for  publishing  medical  breakthroughs  is  to
    complete all the  tests first, even though victims may die waiting
    for the cautious, methodical testing  procedure to run its course.
    No one in  the  industry  wants  to raise false hopes,  let  alone
    repeat the medical  disasters that have resulted in the past, from
    rushing approval on new treatments.

         On the other hand, the drug  AZT  was  widely  publicized for
    many months before  it  was  approved  in the US,  as  is  ongoing
    research into possible  AIDS  vaccines.    The  difference is that
    ozone offers an actual cure, and  it's  cheap.   AZT does not cure
    but only buys  time, and is expected to cost $10,000  per  patient
    per year, bringing  the  Burroughs-Wellcome  Company  up  to  $300
    million, from the 30,000 reported AIDS cases.

         Only a  few independent physicians  in  the  US  are  already
    applying this discovery  to  their  patients.   Most  hesitate  to
    publicize their work   because   of  the  FDA's  track  record  of
    attacking anyone promoting treatments  that haven't been approved,
    or that don't profit the existing medical industries.

         Early reports suggest that drinking and bathing  in a diluted
    hydrogen peroxide solution  can  produce  results similar to ozone
    blood treatment.   The principle  is  the  same;  peroxide is just
    water molecules with extra oxygen atoms, and it kills the virus by
    oxidation as it spreads through the patient's tissues.   This

                                  Page 2




    offers a possible  home  treatment, as no blood needs to be drawn,
    and hydrogen peroxide is cheap and  plentiful.    Keep  it diluted
    though; in high concentrations it can irritate sensitive  skin and
    induce vomiting when  ingested.    The  proper  dosage has not yet
    been established, so  do-it-yourselfers  are  advised  to  proceed
    cautiously and with the assistance of a freethinking physician.

         This is  as  good  a  place  as  any  for  the   FDA-required
    disclaimer:

            "Information given  here  is  for research and educational
             purposes only   and  is   not   intended   to   prescribe
             treatment."

         Dr. Terry  McGrath  at  Medizone  confirmed   that   hydrogen
    peroxide would in  principle act much like ozone in destroying the
    AIDS virus, but pointed out that  it's  never  likely to be tested
    and proven in  the  laboratory.    There's  simply   no   economic
    incentive, since it's  an  unpatentable process and offers no more
    commercial returns than most other natural remedies.

         So it's up to individual patients  and  concerned citizens to
    push these options out into the open, immediately,  before various
    companies get too  financially  committed  to  the assumption that
    AIDS will continue to spread and to be incurable.
