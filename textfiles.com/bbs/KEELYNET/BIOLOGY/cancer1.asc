         WASHINGTON -  A  study by a leading U.S. health scientist has
    found a statistically significant  link  between  cancer and human
    exposure to electromagnetic fields from the electrical  wires that
    crisscross the nation.

         The unpublished  findings by Dr. Genevieve Matanoski of Johns
    Hopkins University add  to  concern  in  the  American  scientific
    community that health  risks  from  power  distribution  lines  no
    longer can be ruled out.

         Matanoski, a  professor  of epidemiology, said Wednesday that
    her findings are preliminary and  require further testing but that
    the results had changed her view of the theory about a cancer link
    to power lines.

         "I thought before that the theory was wrong," she said.  "I'm
    not so sure any more."

         The major conclusions from her study of 50,000 New York state
    telephone workers are  that  there  may  be an increased  risk  of
    leukemia among active  workers and that incidence rates for almost
    all types of cancer are highest among  linemen,  whose exposure to
    electromagnetic fields is  the  highest  in  the telephone  worker
    group.

         Her study  found three cases of leukemia among 4,500 linemen,
    an incidence rate seven times higher  than  among  other telephone
    workers.

         Matanoski also  found  exceptionally  high  rates  of  breast
    cancer among male technicians who work on central office telephone
    switching equipment.  Her  study  found two cases of breast cancer
    among 9,000 central office technicians;  ordinarily  the incidence
    rate for males would be about one in one million, she said.

         (The study apparently did not address the effects, if any, on
    people who live near power lines or towers.)

         Matanoski reported  on  her  study  at  a  technical  meeting
    sponsored jointly by  the Energy Department and the Electric Power
    Research Institute in Portland, Ore., two weeks ago.  She said she
    expects to publish the findings early next year.

         A few   days   before  the  meeting,   officials   of   EPRI,
    representing most electric  utilities,  sent  letter   to  utility
    executives noting that  Matanoski's  results "may attract national
    attention because they suggest an increased risk of cancer."

            This article was taken from the Dallas Times Herald
                       On Sunday, December 3, 1989.

         NEW YORK - Two events last  week  called  attention  to a new
    headache of the  technological  era:  the cost of  reducing  human
    exposure to electromagnetic radiation.





         On Monday,  International  Business Machines Corp.  confirmed
    that it cut  radiation from its new  large-computer  terminals  to
    comply with requests from European customers.

         On Wednesday, a researcher from Johns Hopkins University said
    she had found  a  link  between  cancer  and  human   exposure  to
    electromagnetic fields from power lines.

         The twin   developments  highlighted  public  concerns  about
    whether electricity - the lifeblood  of  modern society - could be
    harming the people it intended to serve.

         Most of  the  discussion  so  far  has  focused   on  whether
    electromagnetic radiation really  is  harmful and in what amounts.
    But even if  the early warnings  turn  out  to  be  overstated,  a
    movement to reduce  human exposure to it seems to  be  well  under
    way.

         The questions are what steps can be taken to cut exposure and
    how much will  they cost? The reassuring answer is that many steps
    can be taken easily and cheaply.  Even daunting problems may prove
    easier to solve than many think.

         Louis Slesin,  who began putting out Microwave  News  in  New
    York City a   decade  ago,  said  the  latest  developments  carry
    conflicting messages.

         On the bad side, he said, the  Johns  Hopkins study indicated
    biological effects from  alarmingly low levels of  electromagnetic
    radiation.

         But on  the good side, the new IBM displays show that cutting
    radiation - at least in the case  show that cutting radiation - at
    least in the case of video display terminals does  not always have
    to be expensive.  An  IBM  official  said  last  week that the new
    displays were built about as inexpensively as the old ones.

         IBM, incidentally, says it produced  the new displays only to
    satisfy customer demands, not because of any health  concerns.  So
    far no other companies have followed suit.

         IBM's new  terminals don't reduce radiation at a frequency of
    60 hertz (cycles  per  second),   the   frequency  that  has  been
    implicated in several medical studies, including  the one at Johns
    Hopkins.

         Sixty hertz  radiation  is emitted by all kinds of electrical
    devices, from hair dryers to coffee  makers to larger electricity-
    powered machines.

         Fortunately, early studies indicate that any danger is mainly
    from long-term exposure at sufficiently close ranges.   The fields
    of most devices  drop  off  sharply  a few inches away, and people
    don't spend all day with them.

         Likewise, the hazard of video  display terminals, if any, can
    be minimized by  keeping  an arm's length from the  screen  and  a
    greater distance from neighboring terminals.

         There may  even  be  relatively inexpensive ways to deal with
    power lines, both the long-distance  transmission  lines  and  the
    high-current distribution lines  that go straight  into  populated




    areas.

         According to  Slesin,  one  way to cut power lines' fields is
    disarmingly simple: Anchor two  wires  side  by  side,  as  in the
    average extension cord.  Their alternating current  fields  should
    substantially cancel each other out.

         Utilities have gotten interested because the public's fear of
    electromagnetic fields has  contributed to long delays in building
    transmission lines - even longer  than  the  notorious  delays  in
    building new generating plants.


                             SPECIAL NOTE

         Last month in `Consumer Report' they issue  a  warning,  that
    children and pregnant women should not use electric blankets do to
    electromagnetic fields.
