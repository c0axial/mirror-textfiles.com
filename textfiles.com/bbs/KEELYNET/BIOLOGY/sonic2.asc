                          Metal Carving with Super-Sound

       Ultrasonic waves now   have   found   a   new   and  most  important
       application.  Their ultra-high frequency vibrations make it possible
       to activate SOFT steel tools so that they can carve into the HARDEST
       of substances.

       No one would believe that an ordinary pen point can penetrate a hard
       slab of thick glass.  Nor that a  perfect  thread  can be cut into a
       disk of tungsten-carbide,  which  is  one  of  the  hardest  of  all
       presently-made metals, with  nothing  better  than a run-of-the-mill
       standard screw.

       Neither could be done, of course, in the USUAL manner but as soon as
       one of these objects is attached to  a  SUITABLE bit through which a
       current of ultrasonic waves is chased, the miracle happens.

       Be it pen  point  or  screw,  a little cogwheel or even  a  well-cut
       cameo-like picture, it begins to SWING UNBELIEVABLY fast!

       In fact it  vibrates  27,000 times a second.  NO SURFACE hard enough
       to stand up against such impact CAN RESIST PENETRATION.

       Anything resilient, on the other  hand,  remains  unaffected  by the
       driving force of the vibration.  A finger inadvertently  held  under
       the carving piece  remains  unhurt,  simply because the flesh is TOO
       CUSHIONY for the bite.

       The Cavitron Equipment Corporation  of Long Island City, N.Y. avails
       itself of this scientific discovery using a cheap abrasive  and jets
       of water, thereby eliminating costly methods and materials.

       Vangard notes...

           This article  seemed  particularly  apropo for KeelyNet since we
           are interested in sonic phenomena  as researched by John Worrell
           Keely.

           Tornados have shown that paper straws can be propelled  at  such
           high velocity that they will penetrate telephone poles and trees

                                      Page 1





           with no damage to the straw.

           Unfortunately, the   article  does  not  detail  the  degree  of
           deflection from a fixed axis,  but it would seem to be dependent
           on the speed with which the cutting was desired without it being
           so great as to cause a loss in thrust.  Although  here it is not
           power but speed which does the work.

           We are  reminded  here  of  Keely's  discovery  of the molecular
           disintegration process  which   used  a  specific  signature  of
           acoustic frequencies.   He  was able to reduce  quartz  to  dust
           simply from  the  proximity of the vibrating head of his device.
           Not much is known about the machine  as  Keely destroyed it when
           ordered to reveal the secrets of his devices to the courts.  All
           the details we have are in the Keely section of KeelyNet.

           We are   also   reminded   of   one   of  Tesla's   experiments,
           (considerably after Keely) which used mechanical vibrators.  The
           principle was  used  to  demonstrate  that  all  mass  could  be
           destroyed or otherwise damaged from resonant oscillations.

           One such story says Tesla had  a giant chain link suspended from
           the ceiling.  A small mechanical vibrator was  attached  to  the
           link and  tuned  to  the resonant frequency of the line.  Within
           minutes, the  link began to  "beat  like  a  human  heart"  then
           shattered into pieces.

           Modern researchers into this field include Professor  Gavraud of
           France and his investigations into INFRASONIC frequencies (below
           15 cycles  per  second).   It was found that 7 cycles per second
           was the most disastrous frequency  found  for  all  matter.  The
           oscillations at  7  cycles  are  quite unnatural  and  bring  on
           rupturing at a rate proportional to the amplitude of the wave.

           It is  almost  impossible  to generate such low frequencies with
           electronics, so mechanical systems were used.  Reports indicated
           the wave could be detected as  much  as  30  miles form the test
           site.  A  truck mounted weapon was built by the  French  in  the
           60's using the principle.

           Modern cutting  techniques  include  the use of water ejected at
           very high  pressures  (on  the  order  of  50,000  PSI)  to  cut
           extremely hard surfaces, leaving clean cut edges and no residue.
           Lasers also  are  used  for cutting and are in essence  ejecting
           "wavicles" of  matter/energy  at very high rates of speed to cut
           or burn.
