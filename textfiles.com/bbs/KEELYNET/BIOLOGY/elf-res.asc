                        R&D ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH SECTION:

              "Worry Over Power Lines Likely to Last," by James Glanz

       Potential hazards of extremely low frequency fields (ELF) have taken
       an extremely low  profile  amid  public  accusations that microwaves
       from cellular phones might cause brain cancer.

       Far from the  media crowd surrounding  the  cellular  controversy  ,
       however, several researchers have expressed the opinion that studies
       of ELF's potential  hazards  are  more  likely  to  affect  American
       industry and society   in   the   long   run.    ELF,   defined   as
       electromagnetic radiation at frequencies  below 300 Hz, includes the
       60-cycle radiation emitted by everything from high-tension  lines to
       toasters to video display terminals.

       "I think most  of  the  heat is still on the power-line issue," says
       Bill Guy, professor  emeritus   at   the   Univ.   of   Washington's
       bioengineering center, Seattle.   Guy,  who  has performed  numerous
       laboratory studies on  the physiological effects of microwaves, says
       there is "no  documented  literature  that  I  know  of  that  would
       indicate any danger of cancer [caused by] cellular telephones."

       The scientific record  on  ELF  is  less  reassuring,   says   Larry
       Anderson, a researcher  at  Pacific  Northwest  Laboratories  (PNL),
       Richland, WA.

       "I think what  we're  seeing  is that  most  recent  epidemiological
       studies tend to support the findings of earlier studies,"  he  says,
       referring to elevated  rates  of  leukemia  for people who live near
       power lines.

       Other studies point to slightly  increased  rates  of  leukemia  and
       brain cancer for  people  occupationally  exposed to  ELF,  such  as
       electricians and telecommunications workers.

       The number of  people  habitually exposed to ELF is likely to be far
       higher than those exposed to microwaves from hand-held cellular

       phones, even if the phones do turn out to be a threat.

       Anyone whose sights are set on proving a link between microwaves and
       cancer would do  well  to  study the history of such attempts in the
       ELF regime.  Although many researchers  are  convinced  of  the link
       between ELF and cancer, others (such as Robert Adair, a physicist at
       Yale Univ.) point to the many conflicting studies  or  ridicule  the
       often marginal statistical certainty of the results.

       In one case, an epidemiological study found an elevated incidence of
       cancer among people  who  lived  near power lines, but a later study
       found that "residential traffic density  is strongly associated with
       childhood cancer...among the same study population," report ed PNL's
       Thomas Tenforde in last year's Annual Review of Public Health.

       When they are  not taken into account, such "confounding  variables"
       can invalidate statistical conclusions.

       Particularly damaging to  the  persuasiveness of the cancer-ELF link
       is the lack of any established mechanism  by  which  the weak fields
       that penetrate the body might have a deleterious  effect  on  cells.
       Adair has written down thermodynamic equations that he says describe
       the current flowing  through  cell  membranes, and he estimates that
       random, fluctuating fields around  the  membranes would have effects
       thousands of times larger than any external ELFs could have.

       As a result of such considerations, many researchers are looking for
       a mechanism by which this naturally occurring noise  would " average
       out," permitting the weak but steady 60-cycle oscillations to have a
       noticeable effect on cells.

       In one theory,  the  ELF  fields  resonate  with natural oscillation
       frequencies of cellular ions such  as  calcium and potassium.  These
       frequencies can be related to the cyclotron frequencies  of the ions
       in Earth's magnetic   field,  or  they  can  be  determined  by  the
       physiology of cell membranes.  Other  theories emphasize the spatial
       coherence of ELF-induced currents over an entire cell.   The  random
       currents are again presumed to cancel.

       Still another approach  to  the  ELF question is to directly examine
       the effect of the fields on animals  and cells in vitro.  With these
       methods, some groups  have found deleterious effects  -  and  others
       have failed to.

       Despite all this uncertainty, there is one thing the ELF researchers
       can tell their  cellular-phone  counterparts for sure: Watch out for
       politics.  "It's driven by factors  other  than  just  the science,"
       warns PNL's Anderson of such research.  "The issue is one of public
       interest.  For that reason, whether or not there are health effects,
       we need to get some resolution to it."

        Lightning-rod effect  of human magnifies effect of a 60-Hz, 10-kV/m
        electric field 18-fold.  Such fields  are commonly produced by over
        head power lines.  The field induces currents of up to 2000 nA/cm^2
        in the person's skin.  Researchers are trying to find  out  whether
        those currents can have adverse effects.
