This particular article relates directly to the work of Royal Rife, who found
the resonant frequency of various bacteria and virii, excited them at these
frequencies and BLEW THEM UP just like Memorex and the shattered glass.  It
also relates to a possible means of deriving complex frequency relationships
as used by John W. Keely in the late 1900's to produce phenomena ranging from
instant dissociation of water to levitation to disintegration of quartz.

then call back and take them down.  There are several files on Rife including
his frequency list as well as multiple files on Keely and his work.

The article was originally from the May 28th, 1994 NEW SCIENTIST and I don't
think this is the complete text.  But if you have a copy of it, I'd appreciate
one at the above mailing address or uploaded to KeelyNet for further study,
thanks!

                   Plants Grow with Sound of Molecular Music

Joel Sternheimer, a French physicist and musician, writes melodies that
allegedly help plants grow, and has recently applied for an international
patent covering his method of music-making.

The tunes are not random melodies: he chooses each note to correspond to an
amino acid in a protein, and the full tune corresponds to an entire protein.

Sternheimer claims that when plants 'hear' the appropriate tune, they produce
MORE of that protein.  (through resonant stimulation....Vanguard)  He also
writes tunes that inhibit the synthesis of proteins.

Using simple physics, he claims to be able to translate into audible
vibrations of music the quantum vibrations that occur at the molecular level
as a protein is being assembled from its constituent amino acids.

Sternheimer claims that in experiments, tomatoes exposed to his tunes grew
two-and-a-half times larger than controls.

He also claims to have STOPPED AN INFECTION of the tomatoes with a mosaic
virus by playing the tunes that INHIBITED ENZYMES vital to the virus.  The
tunes are very short, he says, and need only be played once.

Sternheimer warns scoffers to be careful tinkering with the tunes because they
can affect people as well.  "Don't ask a musician to play them," he says.
"You must be very careful."  Sternheimer says that one of his musicians had
difficulty breathing after playing the tune for cytochrome C too often.
