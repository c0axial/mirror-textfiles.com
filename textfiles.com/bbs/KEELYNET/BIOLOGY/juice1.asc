                         Reviving Organs with Plant Juice?

       Mr. Ed Stewart,  a Los Angeles cabinetmaker, claims to have restored
       a dead friend back to life in 1959.   The man had apparently died of
       a heart attack.

       Stewart claims to  have opened his chest, rubbed the  heart  with  a
       special plant juice, and stimulated it with 110 volts.  The man came
       back to life and is reputed to be now living in Hawaii.

       The revivifying technique  is  also claimed to work on small animals
       which Mr. Stewart suffocates in jars  in  his  garage.  A dead mouse
       can be revived in three hours, while a small dog  takes  about  five
       hours.  Stewart says, "Sometimes, I buy those little chicken giblets
       in the A & P, you know, chicken hearts and gizzards, and I make them
       beat again using my plant juice before I cook them for dinner."

       A former resident  of  Hawaii,  Mr.  Stewart  says he discovered the
       miraculous juice while trimming hedges at his former home.  His skin
       began to twitch  after being splashed  with  sap  from  one  of  the
       plants.  He has not revealed the name of the plant  because of fears
       that it might  be  used  for  nefarious purposes.  When the juice is
       stimulated with electricity, a deadly gas is given off.

       For the past decade (1970's), Stewart has been sending his papers to
       UCLA, the Army and other government agencies.

       Lynn Eldridge, of the Jerry Lewis  Neuromuscular  Research Center in
       LA, says Stewart may NOT be perpetrating a joke.

            "The extracts from plants like belladonna are  used  to  supply
             nutrients to  human  organs, which must be kept alive while en
             route to a transplant.

             So Stewart might cut the heart  out  of  a  mouse  and keep it
             alive with  plant juice, but the effect is short-lived,  since
             the organ must be placed into a healthy body or it dies.  It's
             impossible to  place a live organ in a dead body and expect it
             to revive every other organ in that body.

             I think Stewart has observed  a  basic  scientific phenomenon,
             but his interpretation is OUT THERE."

       On recently discovering that he had a cancerous tumor,  Stewart says
       although he could  leave  instructions  for  someone  to  revive him
       should he die,  he  still goes for  radiation  treatments.   In  the
       meantime, Stewart claims that Government investigators  are watching
       his garage and have told him not to experiment on humans.
