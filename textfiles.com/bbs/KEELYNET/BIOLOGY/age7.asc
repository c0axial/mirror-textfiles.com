                                Preventing Old Age

       I was much interested in the article in your July issue entitled The
       Riddle of Aging.

       Many years ago a man named Sanford  Bennett  wrote a book called Old
       Age, Its Cause and Prevention.  Bennett at the age  of 50 had become
       an old man  in  poor  health,  suffering  from  a  number of chronic
       complaints and many wrinkles.  Despairing of relief from doctors and
       drugs he finally devised a series  of some 35 different exercises to
       be done in bed before arising in the morning.

       After following them  faithfully  for years he had  become,  in  all
       respects, a young   man   at  70.   This  was  attested  by  medical
       examinations.  His face had become smooth without a single wrinkle.

       His theory was that the body gets  old  through  the accumulation of
       mineral deposits in  the  tissues,  which finally become  stiff  and
       inelastic.

       The object of  his  exercises was to contract and then relax all the
       muscles and tissues  to squeeze  the  mineral  deposits  out  to  be
       carried off in the blood stream.

       If Bennett had not been killed by an accident when he was in his
       80s he might have lived many more years.

       When I was  in  my  early 20s I had no health - suffered  from  poor
       circulation, indigestion, etc.   The  doctors  told my people that I
       had a weak heart muscle and should take no exercise; that I probably
       would not live beyond the age of 30.   They gave me prescriptions so
       strong with strychnine that the druggist finally refused to put them
       up.

       When I was a few years short of 30 I started taking  a few exercises
       on my own.   I bought Bennett's book and have followed his exercises
       pretty regularly ever  since.  I  was  a  member  of  the  New  York
       Athletic Club for  25  years.   I became a good light-weight  boxer,
       wrestler, swam, rowed and practiced jiu-jitsu.

       I am now  88  years old, enjoy good health and swim every morning in
       the salt water pool in the hotel here.  I follow the swim with a

                                      Page 1





       steam bath and a light workout in the gymnasium.  I have no wrinkles
       on my face  and  am often taken for a man in the 60s.  Doctors say I
       have the arteries and heart of a young man.

       I don't know  how  much Bennett's  exercises  have  to  do  with  my
       condition.  I do  think  no exercises should be taken  mechanically.
       The mind should  be  on  them  and  you  should  hold the thought of
       gaining benefit thereby.

       I lent Bennett's book to a doctor  who  has  never returned it.  The
       doctor's theory was  that these exercises discharged  hormones  into
       the circulation.  -  David B. Helm, Brooklyn, N.Y.

       Vangard notes...

            A most  interesting  premise  corresponding  with  one  of  our
            proposed approaches to aging  and  the concept of the body as a
            "filter element" which accumulates residues as life progresses.

            In regard  to  mechanical  methods, we note that  Tesla  highly
            recommended "electro-therapeutic"  currents  passed through the
            body to assist in throwing off  toxins.   This  apparently also
            helps to   kill   microbes   through  rapid  polarization   and
            depolarization.

            It is known that chemical interchanges occur on ionic levels in
            living tissues.   The term is IONTOPHORESIS or ELECTROPHORESIS.
            Except that these usually indicate the use of DC currents.

            In undertaking experiments in  this area, one must keep in mind
            that DC  polarizing currents must never be applied  to  tissues
            for any   extended   period.    Positive   currents  cause  the
            dissolution of tissue (acid response)  while  negative currents
            cause the   concentration   (hardening)   of   tissue   (alkali
            response).

            Bi-Phasic currents  can  be so adjusted as to give the majority
            of the  effect (duty cycle)  to  either  positive  or  negative
            influences.  The  purpose here is to cause a gradual  "milking"
            effect for  the  transport of foreign substances to the cathode
            collector.

            Vibration at  various frequencies  might  also  assist  in  the
            transport of such blockages.  A further hybridization  of  both
            electrical methods  in conjunction with vibration might lead to
            some interesting effects.

            Another item is that of TONE.   This  is the electrical tension
            which our  bodies  present  while  in  a conscious  state.   It
            "biases" the  muscles  at a point sufficiently high  to allow a
            rapid response when thus commanded by mental impulses.

            When a  thought  is "sustained"  for  a  period,  it  causes  a
            polarization of  matter into the pattern of the  thought.   The
            longer the  time  and/or  the  greater  the  intensity  of that
            thought, the sooner the effect  manifests.   This  is  a  basic
            universal law  which  governs manifestation of  all  force  and
            matter.

            We would  greatly  appreciate  a  copy of Bennett's book if you
            happen on a copy.  Perhaps someone near the Library of Congress
            might be willing to look it up  and photocopy it.  We will glad
            pay for the duplication and mailing costs.
