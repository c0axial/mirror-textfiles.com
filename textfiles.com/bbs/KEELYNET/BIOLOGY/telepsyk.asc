                      FROM TELECOMMUNICATIONS TO TELEPSYCHING
                              INTIMACY AT A DISTANCE

                                        by

                              Maurice M. Small,Ph.D.

            From a business or practical perspective the advantages of
       electronic mail and  real  time  live telecommunications are obvious
       and clear. Thus for example, it speeds  up  the  flow of information
       and amongst many other things helps to eliminate the  game of "phone
       tag" (you are  'out'  when  I call and I am 'out' when you return my
       call).

            Similarly it  allows  you  to  very  inexpensively  set  up  an
       electronic conference where geographically separated individuals can
       'meet' and exchange information rapidly and conveniently. Presumably
       the rapid growth of data ( as opposed to voice) communications usage
       of our telephone  systems  as  well as its predicted  surpassing  of
       voice communications in  terms  of  volume  of usage are at least in
       part a result of these perceived advantages.

            Nevertheless there is another  side  to telecommunication which
       is not specifically business or practically oriented;  it  is what I
       will call the 'personal' use of telecommunications.

            As with  the  business  use of telecommunications, the personal
       use is varied, probably even more so. It includes but is not limited
       to the flirting between "DREAMYGIRL" and "TALLTEXAN" involving a
       combination of OLM's ( private online  messages  )  and  public real
       time message in the OVER 30 room of QANTUMLINK's PEOPLE CONNECTION (
       PC).

            Similarly there  is  the  somewhat regular private  discussions
       between DOCTOR and  WINDYCINDY  about her divorce on  GEnie or there
       is the rather heated thread of messages discussing child support on
       COMPUSERVE's ISSUE SIG - special interest group .

            What is unusual about these examples and an almost unlimited
       number of others  is  that  here   are   large   numbers  of  varied
       individuals interacting with  each  other in all the  leisurely  and
       entertaining ways we would expect them to but in all likelihood very
       few of them have ever laid eyes upon each other.

            Everything is  taking  place  electronically,  at  a  distance.
       Moreover there is a surprising vitality, vigor, openness, and

                                      Page 1





       sharing of oneself.  In  our  culture such psychological intimacy is
       usually limited to private settings  between  individuals well known
       to each other.  Here the interactions are often public  and  between
       people who may have just met.

            Using some  of  my  own  experiences as a window let us look at
       some of the details of this 'intimacy at a distance'phenomena. I log
       on to CIS (Compuserve) and get a  message  indicating  that  I  have
       email waiting.

            I read my mail and lo and behold there is a note  from a former
       student of mine  who  I  haven't  heard  from in several üears.  His
       message is interesting in several ways. It is nice to hear after
       several years from a former student  and  friend  of  the family but
       more to the point, there is a 'magnetism' to his letter  not  unlike
       the experience I have with good theatre and literature.

            It jumps  out  at  me.  I answer his letter with one of my own,
       filling him in on the changes that  have  happened  since  our  last
       meeting and inviting him to stay in contact. In about  two  weeks  I
       get a very surprising reply.  Even more surprising than the openness
       and intimate sharing  of the letter is the refreshing absence of any
       differential behavior. This is not a communication between a student
       and his teacher but an intimate sharing between two close friends.

            Intrigued by this I set up a  luncheon  meeting  with  my newly
       found friend. Its  amazing  how much he has matured  since  we  last
       meet. At the luncheon I am disappointed because my former student is
       just that -  the  deferential  behavior  is there in full force. Now
       matter how I try the barrier is still there.

            My potential new friend and  I  are  trapped  in the web of our
       habitual patterns of interacting. He is my former student,  friendly
       but not a friend.

            What has happened?

            Given the  characteristics  of  the telecommunications medium -
       particularly the absence of the typical  clues  to  social class and
       status - we  are free to react to each other as equals,  individuals
       who can and  wish  to share the intimate details of our lives. Given
       face to face communication the symbols  of  our  socio-economic  and
       cultural status are  at  least for the present irresistible  and  we
       default to the  old  patterns  of  interacting.   There  is hope. By
       continuing to share  electronically   we   may  yet  overcome  these
       hurdles.

            Let us  peer  through  another  window.  I am  at  a  CB  party
       sponsored by Compuserve   being   held  at  the  Sheraton  Hotel  in
       Merrimack NH.

            CB like the original Citizen  Band  is  the name Compuserve has
       given to its realtime online telecommunications service.  Only  here
       you have 2  bands  of  40 channels each and can reach a national and
       often international audience.  In  the  room  are  about  30  people
       meeting each other face to face for the first time  even though some
       are quite familiar having conversed many times via CB.

            "So you're 'Teleshrink' (my handle)..... You don't look

                                      Page 2





       anything like I pictured you." Around the room are several computers
       linked to Compuserves's CB, of course.

            People tend to form small groups around each of the computers
       alternating between talking  with  each  other  and  conversing with
       others not there via the CB - saying hello , inviting people to join
       us, giving them directions, etc.  As  I  watch  I  notice  something
       rather odd.

            One of the conversations on the CB is between  two  individuals
       that are PRESENT  IN  THE ROOM. Rather than talk face to face ( they
       could not be more than ten feet apart)  they  are communicating with
       each other via the electronic telecommunications media.

            How artificial, how sad, how alienated... these people can only
       or prefer to  communicate with each other in the restricted  stilted
       manner of telecommunication.  Here  it  is, right before my eyes, an
       example of how computers isolate and dehumanize us!

            Then I  step  back  for  a  moment,   look   carefully  at  the
       individuals and begin to realize that things are not what they seem.
       From her appearance, her demeanor, and the way she is dressed it is
       clear that she is an upper middle class suburbanite who later tells
       me in her Kennedyian accent that she is from Boston while he is a
       somewhat overweight taxicab driver from Brooklyn  New  York,  accent
       and all.

            Of course it is awkward for them to talk face to face; their
       backgrounds and socio-economic status are so different. Yet they
       frequently and enjoyably communicate with each other on the CB
       Simulator.

            What's going  on ? Telecommunications is inherently democratic.
       We are judged by what we type ( the  quality  of our ideas ) and not
       the external signs of our wealth or social status.

            It has some of the characteristics of being in  direct  contact
       with someones' mind  unencumbered  by  the  accoutrements  of social
       class and status that we so often  hide behind. In much the same way
       as we can  by writing personal letters or talking  with  a  stranger
       whom we are sure we will never see again we can be open and intimate
       in expressing our innermost feelings.

            The social  barriers are lowered yet at the same time we remain
       a 'safe distance  apart'.  Rather   than   dehumanizing   them   the
       telecommunications is enriching   their   lives  with   new   social
       experiences.

            They get   to  meet,  to  share,  and  to  know  a  variety  of
       interesting people that they otherwise would have been unlikely to
       have had the opportunity to interact with. No wonder they enjoy
       telecommunications so much and even  in some cases prefer it to face
       to face conversations.  So  do  I,  even  for  some   of   the  most
       psychologically intimate forms of interaction - psychotherapy.

            Below is  a  raw  unedited  excerpt  from the transcript of the
       third Telepsyching session ( psychotherapy via online realtime
       telecommunications) of a 35 year old male who I had been seeing on a
       face to face office visit basis.

                                      Page 3





            We seemed  to  have been getting nowhere fast so I suggested we
       switch. He agreed  and  as  they say  "the  rest  is  history".  The
       transcript speaks for itself. The intimacy and power  of  the  media
       are obvious.

            Would that  all psychotherapy were as productive as this fairly
       typical Telepsyching session. Like  Freud's  couch  this  new way of
       doing therapy - this shall we say electronic couch -  eliminates the
       distractions associated with face to face communications  and  let's
       us go directly  for the therapeutic gold.  And you don't even need a
       notebook, both therapist  and patient  can  easily  get  a  complete
       transcript.

            Have  we  stumbled  onto  the  royal  road  to  psychotherapy ?
       Possibly.  I do  know  beyond  a  doubt that for some people in some
       situations Telepsyching is the preferred mode and is extraordinarily
       effective. What a powerful teaching  and  learning  tool  it  is for
       those wishing to learn the otherwise ephemeral art of psychotherapy.

            What more needs to be said except I would very  much appreciate
       your comments and criticisms.

       EXCERPT FROM THE THIRD TELEPSYCHING SESSION WITH 35 YEAR OLD MALE

       THERAPIST:
            Can you  describe  one  or two of the incidents were you really
            wanted to be angry with one or  both of your parents and didn't
            dare to?

       PATIENT:
            the tomato  juice incident when my Father wanted  my  to  drink
            tomato juice,  and  I was refusing to because the stuff made me
            sick..  I would spank me ever  so  often  when I wouldn't drink
            it. After  a few round my mother intervened,  but  I  was  just
            resigned to the situation and not being able to do anything.

       THERAPIST:
            Do you  realize  in  the  above you said" I would spank me...".
            Maybe its nothing but could it be that you are identifying with
            your father and now doing the psychological spanking?PATIENT: I
            hadn't realized that I typed that until you pointed it out, but
            yes there have been quite a few  things to support the idea.  I
            do mentally beat myself a lot.

       THERAPIST:
            Hm... in this incident(s) there also seems to be a blending of
            thought, feelings, and actions.... Your father  was forcing you
            to do  something  that  was  detestfull  to  you  and  you were
            fighting back by resisting...  even  when he spanked you ... As
            an adult can you see how horrible that situation is?

       PATIENT:
            I don't know if I would use the word horrible  to  describe it.
            In fact  I  think  that  I have a feeling of triumph associated
            with it. After all, I won by  not  drinking  the  tomato juice.
            That last  observation  is  new,  I've  always  considered  the
            incident as an example of one of my bad experiences.



                                      Page 4





       THERAPIST:
             Interesting.... in  your eyes you won!!! Nevertheless, doesn't
             the idea of forcing a child,  or trying to, to do something as
             inconsequential as drinking tomato juice against  his  will...
             doesn't that strike you as unfair, wrong?

       PATIENT:
             It's certainly something that I would hope I would never catch
             myself doing  to  my  own kid.     I don't think it was a nice
             thing to do.

       THERAPIST:
             Okay so  as both an adult  and  a  child  you  at  some  level
             realized that  your father was wrong and you resisted...  when
             you did he would spank you...  You were punished for asserting
             your rights  ,  your individuality. In addition you were being
             taught what has been called a kind of "LEARNED HELPLESSNESS".

       PATIENT:
             That sounds right, although  I  don't think I ever consciously
             came to view it that way. In fact it cost me  some  effort  to
             type that last sentence about it not being a nice thing to do.
             I'm just  realizing  that I still view my Father as infallibly
             right.

       THERAPIST:
             Good... things are starting to come together..... Bear with me
             for a  moment more... you resolved  this  conflict/issue  with
             your father  by  becoming  "resigned"  to it.   Is  that  just
             another way  of  saying that as a child thru these and similar
             incidents you  learned to fear/dislike/avoid  being  assertive
             and getting  angry  when  somebody  violated   your   personal
             space... at  least  getting  angry  was  wrong because you got
             punished for doing so?

       PATIENT:
             I think that was close . I also remember a strong feeling of
             helplessness.


       THERAPIST:
             Fascinating!!!! that   fits    very   well...   the   "LEARNED
             HELPLESSNESS".  As a child you were in fact much more helpless
             and dependent  on  your  parents  than  you   are  now  as  an
             independent adult.....
