            The following  article was one that we came across at a lecture
       a few years ago. It first appear in  The  Los Angeles Times paper in
       February 17, 1980.  R.B.

                              ROLE OF LIGHT IN HEALTH

                            `Super Nutrient' Lacking in
               Most Artificially Illuminated Rooms, Scientists Warn.

                   Tinted and dark glasses can harm your health
             and may depress your immune system and endocrine glands!

            A nutrient that travels at a speed of 186,000  miles  a  second
       from a source  93  million miles away rates with food, water and air
       as part of the life-support system on earth.

            It is light from the sun.

            But light also comes from manmade  sources,  and therein lies a
       number of problems.

            The wrong kind of artificial light can make students  irritable
       in school, reduce  production  among factory workers and make office
       workers sluggish.

            Not enough  of  the right kind  of  light  can  interfere  with
       calcium absorption in the elderly and contribute to  brittle  bones,
       scientific studies show.

            On the  positive  side,  light  can be used to control jaundice
       (using so-called "billy lights",  UV)  in  the  newborn. It also can
       boost beef production; cattle that spend "longer days" under correct
       artificial light are 10% to 15% heavier, with no  increase  in  food
       consumption.

            The light  that  some scientists consider a "super nutrient" is
       full-spectrum light, which comes  from  the  sun or from fluorescent
       bulbs of special  design that simulate sunlight. (Actually,  despite
       the designation of  these  artificial lights, they did not match the
       full spectrum of sunlight.)

            Incandescent bulbs and most  fluorescent  bulbs  do not produce
       full-spectrum light. This may be contributing to "mal-illumination,"
       say photo biologists, the scientists who specialize  in the study of
       light's effects on living creatures.

            The science  of  photobiology  is  a  recent  one.  Some  photo
       biologists say doctors showed little  interest  in the subject until
       about five years  ago.  The  American Society of Photo  biology  was
       founded only eight years ago.

            One way of rating light is by a color rendering index, the CRI.
       of 100. Full-spectrum   fluorescent,   91;   standard   cool   white
       fluorescent, 68; other fluorescent, 56.

            Under natural  light or an artificial  source  that  duplicates
       natural light, there  is  less human fatigue and stress  and  better
       visual acuity and production, studies have shown.

       Consider:

            -Plants grown  under  artificial  lighting  that comes close to
       duplicating full-spectrum sunlight  can  be made to flower on preset
       schedules by controlling day length.

            -In dairies, changing the length of light exposure from natural
       9 to 12 hours of light to 16 hours of fluorescent light of the full-
       spectrum type increased the milk yield by 10% to 15%.

            -Full-spectrum light  is  used  to  treat  psoriasis,  neonatal
       jaundice and herpes simplex infections.

            Rays from  sunlight  stimulate  the  pineal  gland, a pea-sized
       organ in the head. This gland secretes  melatonin,  a  hormone  that
       seems to control many bodily functions. When infected  into animals,
       melatonin induces sleep,   inhibits   ovulation   and  modifies  the
       secretion of other hormones.  Experts  say  that  both  plastic  and
       regular eyeglasses and contact lenses block some of  the ultraviolet
       rays that travel through the eye to the pineal gland.

            -At the  Center  for  Improvement  of  Undergraduate Education,
       Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y.,  students  working in a class with
       fluorescent light closely  approximating  sunlight   experienced   a
       significant increase in  visual  acuity  and  a reduction in overall
       fatigue, compared to performance under regular fluorescent lights.

            John Ott, of Sarasota, Fla.,  a  pioneer  in  light  and health
       research, for the  last  50 year has been warning against  unhealthy
       effects of some  kinds  of  light. Earlier, he was rebuffed, but now
       there is basic research that supports his ideas.

            Ott said he first noticed strange  happenings  in living things
       under certain light  sources  when  he  was  working  on  time-lapse
       photography for Walt Disney movies.

            At the  Bronx  Zoo  curators credit full-spectrum lighting with
       helping the tufted puffin, a shy  sea  bird,  survive  in captivity.
       Under the influence of "indoor sunshine," the puffins, for the first
       time, laid eggs that hatched.

            Strange things happened in Burnett Park Zoo in  Syracuse, N.Y.,
       when sunlight-simulating lights  were installed in an effort to stop
       vandalism. "The zoo  became  a  veritable   maternity   ward,"  said
       director Charles T. Clift.

            "The cougars  fell  in love all over again and  produced  their
       fourth litter, we  collected  five goose eggs, at least 8 lambs were
       born, and the deer population increased by 20. Big Lizzie gave birth
       to a bear cub. The wallaby produced  a  new  mini-kangaroo  and  the
       chimpanzee got pregnant."

                                      Page 2





            Phillip Hughes  Ph.D.,  a  scientist  at Duro-Test Corp., North
       Bergen, N.H., said the Syracuse zoo's experience is just one example
       of the effects of natural-like light.  Hughes is a vice president at
       Duro-Test, the firm  that  makes the most widely used  full-spectrum
       fluorescent light, Vita-Lite.

            A specialist   in   neurological   sciences,   physiology   and
       psychology, Hughes said. "Light  is  definitely  a  nutrient.  It is
       essential to life and the whole endocrine system. Light  has  a role
       in triggering hormones.

            `Vitamin D  is synthesized by ultraviolet in the skin.  Vitamin
       D receptors help proper bone development  and prevent development of
       rickets. Vitamin D facilitates the absorption of calcium.

            "Under light not closely approximating the sun, one study found
       calcium absorption dropped  off  in the elderly in  the  indoors  in
       winter. But those  under  full-spectrum  lighting had an increase in
       calcium absorption."

            In an upcoming book on holistic medicine, produced with funding
       from the National Institute of Mental Health, Hughes says:

            "Along with food, air, and water,  sunlight is a most important
       survival factor in  human  life.  Solar  radiation  activates  other
       important biochemical events  in  our  bodies  involved in endocrine
       control, timing of our biological  clocks,  entrainment  of  24-hour
       circadian rhythms, immunologic  responsiveness,  sexual  growth  and
       development, regulation of  stress and fatigue, control of viral and
       cold infections, and  dampening   of  functional  disorders  of  the
       nervous system."

            He said the last two or three generations are the first to have
       spent three-fourths of their lives under artificial  light.  "We  do
       not fully know the effect," he said.

            The Russians  know  more  than  Americans,  perhaps,  about the
       health effects of various kinds of light.

            Under light that is full-spectrum,  Russian  scientific reports
       show, production goes up and absenteeism goes down.   This  kind  of
       light is mandated in many Russian workplaces.

            In schools,  it  has been demonstrated in Russia, full-spectrum
       lighting or ultraviolet  treatment   helps   academic   performance,
       improves student behavior and lessens fatigue.

            The Russians practice light therapy on coal  miners  who  spend
       their working day  out of natural light. Once a day coal miners must
       disrobe and spend  half an hour in  natural  light  or  under  full-
       spectrum artificial lighting.

            Hughes said the Russians have reported that  this  regiment  is
       useful in both  preventing  and  treating  black  lung disease. "The
       Russian researchers and health specialists  have documented that the
       body's tolerance to environmental pollutants is increased  by  full-
       spectrum light, which    also   increased   the   effectiveness   of
       immunization procedures," he said.

            West Germany's  government  restricts  the  use  of  cool white
       limited-spectrum fluorescent bulbs  in  public  buildings because of
       their distorted spectral output.

            Ott, the pioneer health and light expert, maintains that sodium
       vapor lights, now  offered as the latest technological  advancement,
       do not reproduce the full spectrum of natural light.

            "The Fort  Worth, Texas school district was one of the first to
       install sodium lighting in perhaps  a  dozen schools.  It was one of
       the first to take them all out because complaints of  both  teachers
       and pupils of   headaches,   eyestrain   and   other  health-related
       problems," he said.

            Ott contends  that  another major  problem  with  all  gaseous-
       discharge types of lights, including the mercury vapor  and limited-
       spectrum fluorescent light, is that they emit radiation that grossly
       weakens muscle strength,  affecting  both  academic  achievement and
       behavior.

            A recent Consumers' Research  magazine  report  on  the risk to
       health from some fluorescent lamps suggested new probes  by industry
       and the government.

            "There are   good  reasons,  in  our  opinion,  for  government
       agencies and industry  engineers  to  initiate  promptly  laboratory
       research programs on the effects of the spectral characteristics  of
       artificial lighting on   animals  used  in  research  and  on  human
       beings," it said.

            A psychiatrist  who uses light  in  his  therapy  is  Dr.  H.L.
       Newbold of New York.

            "Before we began civilizing ourselves into semi-invalidism,  we
       received an abundance  of  full-spectrum light: the kind that nature
       provides for us in the form of sunlight,"  says  Newbold,  author of
       "Mega-nutrients for Your Nerves."

            "What we now get is a mere fraction of the spectrum."

            "Once we are all ensconced behind our office  desks  or  in our
       living room armchairs,   science   efficiently   furnishes  us  with
       electric light.

            "If your company is really up  to date you are probably working
       under fluorescent light, which may be an industrial engineer's dream
       of perfection - but happens to be the most nutrient-deficient of all
       lighting devices.

            "Even ordinary  light  bulbs  are  preferable   to   the  total
       artificiality of the fluorescent environment."

            Newbold uses  full-spectrum  lighting  in  his office and has a
       special plastic in place of glass in his office windows to allow the
       ultraviolet from natural daylight to enter.

            To let the ultraviolet from  full-spectrum  lighting  into  the
       pathway to the brain, he suggests special lenses for  spectacles and
       contracts for his patients.

            In the  treatment  of  yellow  jaundice,  newborns  used to get
       complete blood transfers. That was  until  a  nurse  noticed  that a
       jaundiced infant seemed to be getting better on his own.

            The infant's  crib was near an open window, and  natural  light
       was streaming in.  The  babies  near  the  wall  and out of reach of
       sunbeams were not doing as well.

            So light treatment was tried  on  babies  with jaundice, and it
       worked. Now, about 25,000 newborns a year get the treatment.

            In fact, three famous babies received the treatment  some years
       ago at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in New York.

            Three of  the  Kienast quints had jaundice, and they were cured
       by full-spectrum lighting. When they  went home, it was to a nursery
       with full-spectrum light.

                  HOW LIGHTING AND GLASSES CAN AFFECT YOUR MOODS

           *************************************************************


            The type of lighting un your house and office  can  affect your
       mood and may even help prevent or cure arthritis and other diseases,
       an expert has revealed.

            Even the  color  tint of the lenses you wear in your glasses or
       sunglasses can rob  you  of  energy   by  preventing  certain  light
       wavelengths from entering  your  system,  according   to  John  Ott,
       director of the Environmental Health and Light Research Institute in
       Sarasota, Fla.

            "Light is   well   documented  that  light  entering  the  eyes
       influences the master glands, the pituitary and pineal glands, which
       control the entire endocrine system."

            Different kinds  of  lighting   conditions   include   natural,
       unfiltered sunlight, incandescent  light  bulbs, fluorescent  light,
       sunlight filtered through  different  kinds  of  glass, and sunlight
       reflected of different color interiors.

            In experiments on first grade students in Sarasota, researchers
       have found that children who work  in  a  classroom  with cool white
       fluorescent lighting are more hyperactive than students  in  another
       classroom with full-spectrum   fluorescent   tubes  which  duplicate
       natural sunlight but with shields to stop harmful radiation.

            "Under the  standard,  cool white  fluorescent  lighting,  some
       first graders showed  nervous  fatigue,  irritability,   lapses   of
       attention and hyperactive  behavior," says Ott, author of Health And
       Light (Pocket Books, $1.95).

            "Within a  week  after  the  new  lights  were  installed,  the
       children settled down and paid more attention to their teachers."



                                      Page 5





            Dr. Ott says that different kinds of lights can also affect the
       course of disease.

            Experiments with  mice have shown that mice who live under pink
       fluorescent light develop cancer  more  quickly  than  mice who live
       under white fluorescent light and natural light.

            Tinted sunglasses   can   also   affect  you   physically   and
       psychologically because they  block  out certain colors of the light
       spectrum that you need for health, Ott claims.

            He says he persuaded a man with prostate cancer to stop wearing
       pink tinted eyeglasses.

            "For three  years  he  has   worn   new   full-spectrum   clear
       ultraviolet transmitting spectacles and, apparently, his problem has
       disappeared."


           *************************************************************

                                   SPECIAL NOTES

            Our friends,  Dean and Mary Hardy, authors of  "Pyramid  Energy
       Explained", told us that they see more people that have been getting
       mercury poisoning in their system.

            Through investigating  where these people were living and their
       personal lifestyles, they  found   that   in   most   cases,   these
       individuals were being exposed to mercury vapor lighting systems.

            These people  were  found  to be sleeping under  street  lights
       which were of  the  mercury  vapor  type.  After a certain amount of
       time, the frequency at which mercury  resonates  would  be  absorbed
       into the body.

            Some of them blocked out the light which shined into their room
       which eventually corrected the problem.

            One observation  I  have made in my own workplace.   A  mercury
       vapor lighting system was installed on the outside of our building a
       few years ago.

            Since that  time we seem to have a problem making grass grow in
       the area.  We must now frequently  replace  the dead grass with new.
       Additionally, we seem to have a problem with insects.

            Of course, sodium lighting puts out a yellow light which drives
       insects away, so that might account for the insect problem.

            Additionally, we  refer  you to Tesla's idea that  any  RADIANT
       SOURCE was emitting  extremely energetic and highly charged PHYSICAL
       PARTICLES.  He indicated that this  highly energetic matter could be
       picked up or accumulated using the proper techniques.

            Does this not then offer a possibility that the  mercury  vapor
       under the influence of high potential currents could be so projected
       as to accumulate in the body tissues?
