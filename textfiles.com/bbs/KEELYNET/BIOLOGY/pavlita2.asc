This is an interesing file on the psychotronic generator research of the late
Robert Pavlita.  These devices are specific geometries which serve as
waveguides for subtle energies.

Thanks Jerry...your keelynet article sparked my interest

I've got a bit of material on Pavlita ....see 2 page report below.

Look forward to hearing from you if you can track down that group.

THE EXTRAORDINARY PSYCHOTRONIC GENERATOR
..........................................

copyright - Australian Lateral Tbinking Newsletter

"All living things are filled with a type of energy that until recently wasn't
known to Western science. This psychotronic energy seems to be responsible for
psychokinetic effects. A device has been discovered which collects this energy
from a person, stores it,  then releases it on demand.  It has been used to
power a small electric motor."

This idea of a bio-energy is not new. The ancient Chinese knew about it - they
called it VITAL ENERGY.  The Hindus called it  PRANA. The Polynesian Huna
people called it  MANA.  Currently the Soviets refer to it as BIOPLASMIC
ENERGY and the Czechoslovakian Scientists (where the generator was "re-
discovered") call it PSYCHOTRONIC ENERGY.

It was suspected that such an energy existed for some time but it wasn't until
the Russians invented the KIRLIAN PHOTOGRAPHIC PROCESS that this strange
energy could actually be observed.

The secrets of the Psychotronic generator were discovered in a strange manner.
Robert Pavlita was the design director of a large Czech textile plant and
patented the design for a new textile process. The royalties from the
successful application of his process were substantial and enabled him to
spend more time on his hobby which was metallurgy and the search for
information on the fabled psychotronic devices. He apparently spent years
searching the archives of Czech libraries and eventually stumbled on the
information he needed in the form of manuscripts which hadn't been researched
for centuries.

Pavlita found that by combining various metals and making them to a critical
shape, he could manufacture devices which would store bio-energy for a
specific purpose. He has even used specially treated wood.

After 30 years of experimenting Pavlita's work came to the attention of  the
Hradec Kralove University Physics department who decided to do some tests.
An electric motor was set up with a free-spinning device attached to it.
Pavlita's generator was placed next to the motor. Pavlita focussed his mental
energy on his generator and the free-spinning attachment on the motor slowed
to a stand-still. As he continued to focus on his generator the attachment
proceeded to spin backwards, against the thrust of the motor spindle. The
university tested Pavlita for 2 years and concluded that an unknown form of
energy was involved and that there was definitely no fraud involved.

This "stored" PK energy is not new. In the 1921 July 30th edition of the
British medical magazine Lancet it was reported that a Dr. Charles Russ showed
the ophthalmic Congress at Oxford an apparatus that caused a solenoid to move
by merely gazing at it. There have been many others since this but it was left
to Pavlita to commercialise the process and apply for patents.

It was found that this psychotronic energy could be transferred from humans to
inert materials such as paper, wood, silk, etc. And this energy was clearly
not electrostatic in nature because it worked just as well under water! It was
this last feature that caused the Iron Curtain scientists to sit up and take
notice.

The Czech Scientists believe that everyone has psychic abilities, but they are
blocked by our belief system, so that most of the time we are unaware of them.
To cause them to work we need something to evoke these hidden abilities which
is apparently what the psychotronic generators do.

The psychotronic generators which Pavlita has built apparently resemble spare
parts from the movie 2001! They come in all shapes and sizes, each being
designed for a specific purpose. And strangely enough some of them closely
resemble "ancient ritual artifacts" displayed in museums around the world!
(Think about that one!!)

The method of making them work is to simply focus your gaze and "stare" at
them. After several minutes sufficient "charge"is stored for the device to
be able to perform usefully.

One of the devices he built looks like a cross between a "magic wand" and a
fat screwdriver. When it is "charged" it attracts all sorts of small non-
magnetic objects in the same way that an electrostatically charged object does
....except.........it works under water!!!

No electrostatically charged device will work in a moist atmosphere, let alone
under water. When you brush your hair in a very dry atmosphere, you will
probably notice - or hear - an electrical discharge. This is caused by the
build-up of an electrostatic charge.

A psychotronic charge appears to work on an entirely different principle.  The
Czechoslovakian Academy of Science had mathematicians, physicists, electronics
experts and electro-physiologists all investigate the generators while the
devices were shielded against air currents, static electricity, magnetic
fields and temperature changes.  They still worked despite all possible
precautions against extraneous effects.

The well known Czech mathematician and physicist Dr. Julias Krmessky made the
following comment:  "The radiation goes right through glass, water, wood,
cardboard and even iron. It's strength does not diminish at all and
furthermore the mind seems to control this energy.  Experiments were done with
seeds. Psychotronic energy almost doubled the growth rate of seeds in some of
the scientific experiments. A further demonstration was done with polluted
water. Application of psychotronic energy caused the impurities to drop out of
the water and it was left reasonably pure.

Chemical analysis found that there was a change in the actual molecular
structure of the water itself. The two hydrogen atoms had spread further
apart.  The energy  does not appear to originate from the brain or any one
organ in the body. It appears to originate from a persons entire Life-Field as
photographed by a Kirlian Camera.

Tests with EEG machines on people who are in the process of "charging" these
generators indicate an unusual brain-wave pattern. The only dominant physical
effect noticed is that the charging process doesn't work so well if the person
is tired. The psychotronic generator that was designed to power up a small
electric motor required an initial "charge" of half an hour then only a few
minutes a day. The electric motor apparently ran continuously for 50 hours.

A special generator was built to test the effect on the human brain. Pavlita's
daughter Jana was the subject. The generator was directed at Jana's head and
the EEG monitor attached to her indicated a sudden change in brain-wave
activity. Jana became dizzy and her spatial orientation was affected.

These generators were mentioned on an Australian SBS TV documentary a couple
of years ago. (Secrets of the Russian Psychics).  Apparently one had been used
in an attempt to give a well known Russian leader a heart attack. It was only
partly successful because the well publicized heart attack was only a minor
one.

Experiments were done with other living organisms. Snails subjected to
psychotronic energy withdrew into their shells and went into a state similar
to hibernation. A doughnut shaped generator was found to kill flies, placed
inside it, instantly.  There seems to be unlimited use for this new (?)
energy.

The critical thing about these devices is apparently the shape and form. The
smaller devices collect and store personal PK energy. But experiments with
larger ones indicate that they might well store some form of unknown cosmic
energy. The scientists investigating these devices consider that a pyramid
is a large cosmic psychotronic generator.

One of Pavlita's favourite demonstrations is to place a sheet of glass on a
stand and scatter magnetic fragments over the glass. He then places a powerful
horseshoe magnet under the glass and demonstrates how he can move the magnetic
chips about with this magnet.  Next he uses a psychotronic generator that
looks like a rectangular ball-point pen to pick up the chips on the glass.

They attach themselves to the tip of the generator which is able to overcome
the magnetic force from the magnet underneath the glass to pick up these
chips.  Then he demonstrates the same thing with the whole apparatus under
water!!!

The Czech Scientists think this energy might be the same force that allows
psychic healers to remove a person's health problems and to allow people like
Uri Geller to cause mung beans to sprout while held in the palm of their
hands. They also think it is responsible for the way world famous PK expert
Nelya Mikhailova is able to move small objects at a distance. (This was also
shown on the SBS TV documentary).

However the bottom line to all this is that these psychotronic devices are not
new. They appear to have been around for thousands of years. It was left to
Robert Pavlita to "re-discover" them by searching thru ancient manuscripts,
some apparently over 400 years old!
