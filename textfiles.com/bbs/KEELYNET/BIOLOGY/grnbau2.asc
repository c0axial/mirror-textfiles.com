Q: What's the difference between this kind of program and cult-type abuse and
   Satanic abuse in the kind of cults with the candles and the...

Dr.H: This type of programming will be done in the cults with the candles and
      all the rest. My impression is this is simply done in people where they
      have great access to them or they're bloodline and their parents are in
      it and they can be raised in it from an early age. If they are bloodline
      they are the chosen generation. If not, they're expendable and they are
      expected to die and not get well.  There will be booby traps in your way
      if they aren't non-bloodline people that when they get well they will
      kill themselves. I'll tell you just a little about that. My belief is
      that some people that have ritual abuse and don't have this have been
      ritually abused but they may be part of a non-mainstream group. The
      Satanism comes in the overall philosophy overriding all of this.

      People say, "What's the purpose of it?" My best guess is that the
      purpose of it is that they want an army of Manchurian Candidates, ten of
      thousands of mental robots who will do prostitution, do child
      pornography, smuggle drugs, engage in international arms smuggling, do
      snuff films, all sorts of very lucrative things and do their bidding and
      eventually the megalomaniacs at the top believe they'll create a Satanic
      Order that will rule the world.  One last question. Then I'll give you
      couple of details and we need to shift gears.

Q: You have suggested and implied that at some point at a high level of the
   U.S. Government there was support of this kind of thing. I know we're short
   of time, but could you just say a few words about the documentation that
   may exist for that suggestion?

Dr.H: There isn't great documentation of it. It comes from victims who are
      imperiled witnesses. The interesting thing is how many people have
      described the same scenario and how many people that we have worked with
      who have had relatives in NASA, in the CIA and in the Military,
      including very high-ups in the Military. I can tell you that a friend
      and colleague of mine who has probably the equivalent of half the table
      space on that far side of the room filled with boxes with declassified
      documents from mind-control research done in the past which has been
      able to be declassified over a considerable -- couple of decades --
      period and has read more government documents about mind control than
      anyone else, has a brief that has literally been sent in the past week
      and a half asking for all information to be declassified about the
      Monarch Project for us to try to find out more. Now let me just mention
      something about some of the stuff that my experience is in several
      patients now that you may run into late in the process. I know I'm
      throwing a lot at you in a hurry. Some of it is completely foreign and
      some of you may think, "Gosh, could any of this be true?" Just, you
      know, ask. Find out in your patients and you may be lucky and there
      isn't any of this. Somewhere at a deep level you may run into some
      things like this. Let me describe to you, if I can find my pen, the
      system in one patient. One patient I had treated for quite a while, a
      non-bloodline person. We had done what appeared to be successful work
      and reached final integration. She came back to me early last year and
      said she was symptomatic with some things. I started inquiring. I found
      a part there we'd integrated. The part basically said, "There was other
      stuff that I couldn't tell you about and you integrated me and so I had
      to split off."  I had done some inquiring about things like Alpha, Beta
      as a routine part of it and found they were there and I said to this
      part, "Why didn't you tell me about this stuff?" She said, "Well, we
      gave you some hints but they went right over your head." Says, "I'm
      sorry, but we know that you didn't know enough to help us but now we
      know you can." So the stuff started coming out. It was interesting.  She
      described the overall system -- if I can remember it now -- as being
      like this. The circle represented harm to the body, a system of alters
      whose primary purpose was to hurt her including symptoms like
      Munchausen's, self-mutilation, other kinds of things. Each of the
      triangles represented still another different system. She said, "With
      the exception of me," this one part, "you dealt with the whole circle
      with the work that we did before but you didn't touch the rest of the
      stuff." Okay. In the middle of all this was still another system
      consisting of the Cabalistic Tree, which some of you are aware, looks
      approximately like this with lines in between and so on and so forth.
      There's a rough approximation. That represented another system. Then
      once we got past that she implied that this entire thing was somehow
      encompassed by, what do you call it, an hourglass. I kept thinking we
      were at final integration then I'd find some other parts. This person
      had an eagle-eye husband that was watching for certain things that we
      found to be reliable indicators. So often I would get evidence of
      dissociation within a few days. It would suddenly be picked up. You
      know, what we found was I continued to find evidence of dissociation and
      I'd find parts.  Finally this part, as I got angry with him and said,
      "Why when I give these ideomotor inquiries am I getting lied to?" This
      part said, "Because you don't understand. You're going to get us all
      killed." We started talking and then she basically said, "It's been
      programmed so that if you succeed and think you've succeeded, you will
      fail. They build it in as a way to laugh at you, that if you ever get us
      integrated, we will die."  Here's what she said, this part said, "I'm
      one of twelve disciples," and I've seen this in others, twelve disciples
      within this hourglass each of whom had to memorize a disciple-lesson
      which were basic Satanic kind of premises, philosophies of life like "be
      good to those who hurt you, hate those who are nice to you," on and on
      and on. There may be two or three sentences like that associated with
      each that they had to memorize them. They said, "We are like grains of
      sand falling and when the last grain of sand falls, there's Death." I
      said, "Is Death a part?" "Yes. When the last grain of sand falls the
      Sleeping Giant awakens." The Sleeping Giant was Death, who was then to
      kill them on Day-One or Day-Six after awakening unless certain things
      were followed and we did some of those. Well we also found Death had a
      sister as a backup, used with mirrors to create the sister part. We had
      to get past and deal with that too. Death had certain things that they
      said had to be done to integrate. I started to say, "Oh, come on, they
      lied to you before." She said, "Wait a minute. This what they said you'd
      say.  They said that no doctor would ever believe that they had to go
      these extremes to get us well and that's part of the reason they'd
      fail." I said, "Well, tell me, tell me again." She said, "I have to be
      dressed all in red. I have to have Demerol onboard, have taken Demerol.
      A code has to be given and it has to be in a room that's totally dark.
      It has to happen on Day-One or Day-Six after this part's been awakened."
      I said what I'd have to lose? I had a psychiatrist give her a little
      Demerol.  We used the code. My office didn't have any windows anyway. It
      was pretty easy. Oh, and there had to be four, I think, candles lit.
      Well, fine. So we did it and everything went well. Maybe it would have
      gone well if we hadn't done it, but I decided not to take the chance and
      to trust the patient maybe. Well, so we go on and then we find another
      part. There's Death And Destruction, another backup also with a sister
      that we had to get through. In fact, I think there were two backups
      there. Interestingly, the very last part was an extremely nice part,
      made especially that way so that they wouldn't want to lose them because
      they would be so adorable and so loving and so sweet that they wouldn't
      want to maybe get rid of them. Then we found that she continued to have
      these feelings with this last part left now of darkness and blackness
      inside. What did we find? A curtain. She said, "They assumed that if you
      ever got to this point, you would," and along the way, by the way, we
      had encountered this stuff about the LSD stuff, the Green Bomb
      programming. The message was that she said, "There is a curtain behind
      which are the remaining feelings and memories, but it can't be opened
      from the middle. It's like a stage curtain. It has to opened this way,"
      that it can't be opened. They assumed that you would try to deal with
      all the feelings. That can't be opened until you've dealt with that last
      part and they've integrated. So far it looks like we've got integration
      that's holding.  So I found Death And Destruction and the Hourglass in
      non-bloodline.  "The Tree and the Hourglass," this patient informed me,
      "were made of sand because we were meant to die. We're expendable. We're
      the unchosen generation." I've heard variously that it's crystals or
      blood that fills the Hourglass in bloodline people.  By the way, you can
      do real simple things like turn the Hourglass on its side so nothing can
      fall out, so time stands still to be able to do certain kinds of work.
      Spread the grains of sand on the seashore so that they can't be numbered
      and the time will not be counted. Got that idea from a ritual-abuse
      victim who had seen some of this kind of programming done that another
      therapist was seeing. So those would be just a few other hints about
      things that may be helpful or meaningful. We're talking about very
      intensive things and at deep levels to me this give us two things. One
      thing it gives to me is hope because it gets to material and it makes
      progress like nothing else we've ever seen with these people who have
      it. The second thing it does for me is it demoralizes me, too, because
      although three years ago I had a pretty good idea about the extent and
      breadth of what they had done to these victims, I had no real
      appreciation for the depth and breadth and intensity of what they'd
      done.

      I want to come back to the other question over here now. The other
      question is how many of them can get well? We don't know. In most things
      in the mental health profession we accept two-thirds of the patients are
      going to improve, maybe seventy percent. There's very little we can get
      everybody well. I think one of the sad things we have to face is that
      many of these patients will probably never be well. My personal belief
      is that if they are being messed with their only hope of getting well is
      if they can somehow get out of contact.  Now I know patients who've gone
      to other states and simply had deep-level alters pick up the phone and
      call and said, "This is our new address and phone number" so that they
      could be picked up locally. I mean in an inpatient unit for an extended
      period of time. If they are in a Cult from their area and they are still
      being monitored and messed with, my own personal opinion is we can't get
      them well and can't offer more than humanitarian caring and
      supportiveness. Lots of therapists do not like to hear that. That's my
      opinion. I believe that if somehow they're lucky enough to be wealthy
      enough to have protection, to have somehow gotten away in some way and
      we can work with them without being messed with, that they have a chance
      to reach some semblance of normality and livability with enough
      intensive work. My own personal belief is I don't think anybody with
      this kind of programming is well in this country yet. There are some who
      are well along the way. I've got a couple who are well along in their
      work and have done a tremendous amount, but they're clearly not well
      yet.

Q: Could you speculate on the relationship between this stuff and the fantasy
   games that have been proliferating, Dungeons and Dragons and that sort of
   thing?

Dr.H: Well, there are a lot of things out there to cue people. You want to see
      a great movie, interesting movie, to cue people? Go see "Trancers II."
      You can rent it in your video shop. Came out last fall.  One night in
      sheer desperation for something at the video store, you know? Nine
      o'clock on Friday night.  Everything's gone. I rented a couple of movies
      and one of them is that.  Fascinating. They're talking about Green World
      Order. Yes, "Trancers II." And who is the production company? Full Moon
      Productions. I couldn't see much cuing in "Trancers I," but who's the
      production company in "Trancers I"?  Alter Productions. There are lots
      of things around that are cuing.  There's an interesting person in the
      late sixties who talked about the Illuminati. Have any of you ever heard
      of the Illuminati with regard to the Cult? Had a patient bring that up
      to me just about exactly two years ago. We've now had other stuff come
      out from other patients.  Appears to be the name of the international
      world leadership. There appear to be Illuminatic Counsels in several
      parts of the world and one internationally. The name of the
      international leadership of the Cult supposedly. Is this true? well, I
      don't know. It's interesting we're getting some people who are trying to
      work without cuing who are saying some very similar things. There was an
      old guy in Hollywood in the late sixties who talked about the
      infiltration of Hollywood by the Illuminati. Certainly what some
      patients have said is all of this spook stuff, horror stuff, possession
      and everything else that's been popularized in the last twenty years in
      Hollywood is in order to soften up the public so that when a Satanic
      world order takes over, everyone will have been desensitized to so many
      of these things, plus to continually cue lots of people out there. Is
      that true? Well, I can't definitely tell you that it is. What I can say
      is I now believe that ritual-abuse programming is widespread, is
      systematic, is very organized from highly esoteric information which is
      published nowhere, has not been on any book or talk show, that we have
      found all around this country and at least one foreign country.  Let's
      take a couple of quick questions and we need to get on to other
      material. Yes?

Q: Do you have any techniques for decreasing your level of uncertainty that a
   patient is or is not being still tampered with, "messed with," as you said?

Dr.H: Just that I would ask several of the parts I've inquired about, Core,
      Diana, Wisdom, Master Programmer, several parts inside I would ask about
      these sorts of things and I will keep asking it. As you do additional
      work and get a bit further, I would ask again to find out. In the back?

Q: I wonder if you've heard or you know of the Martin Luther Bloodline?

Dr.H: The what?

Q: Martin Luther Bloodline?

Dr.H: I know nothing about Martin Luther Bloodline. I'll give you one other
      quick tip. Ask him about an identification code. There's an
      identification code that people have. It will involve their birth date.
      It may involve places where they were programmed and it will usually
      involve a number in there that will be their birth order, like zero-two
      if they were second-born. It will usually involve a number that
      represents the number of generations in the Cult, if they are
      bloodlines. I've seen up to twelve now, twelve generations.

Q: I have seen a lot of the things you've been describing today in several
   patients. I wanted to ask you a question about the Seven Systems. You
   mentioned something about systems here. Are there Seven Systems?

Dr.H: There has been that described in some patients, yes, the Seven Systems.

Q: Could you say what that is or a little diagram?

Dr.H: I don't think we know enough to know what it is, honestly. I think it
      may have to do with Seven Cabalistic Trees.

Q: Have you ever had any evidence where any of these people have been tagged
   and there have been anything of their body-parts that might be related to
   this, private parts in particular?

Dr.H: Well, there are certainly people that have had tattoos, that have had a
      variety of other kinds of things, some of which have been, you know,
      documented in cases, but I mean to say, well, maybe they did that to
      themselves or had it done consciously to really prove something, not
      that occurs to right off the bat.  Let me just take this one last
      question back and we need to go on to other material because we're never
      going to get through it all. I'll just ask you to hold your question.

Q: It's not a question but I wanted to say for myself, personally, and perhaps
   for others here as well, I wanted to thank you very sincerely for taking
   this time to come forward. [Applause]

Dr.H: Well, [Applause]

Q: Does anyone want to join us for a standing ovation for this material? It's
   wonderful. [Sustained applause]

Dr.H: A dear friend who's one of the top people in the field, who I know has
      had death threats, but I know struggled for professional credibility in
      believing in MPD and was harshly criticized for even believing in that
      ten and fifteen years ago, and struggled to a point of professional
      credibility. I think in his heart of hearts he knows it's true, but he
      will say things like, "I wouldn't be surprised to find tomorrow it was
      an international conspiracy and I wouldn't be surprised to find tomorrow
      that it is an urban myth and rumor." He tries to stay right on the fence
      and the reason is because it's controversial, because there is a
      campaign underway saying these all false memories induced by, along with
      incest and everything else, by "Oprah" and by books like "The Courage to
      Heal" and by naive therapists using hypnosis. It's controversial. My
      personal opinion has come to be if they're going to kill me, they're
      going to kill me.  There's going to be an awful lot of information
      that's been put away that'll go to investigative reporters and multiple
      investigative agencies, if it happens, and an awful lot of people like
      you , I hope, that if I ever have an accident will be pushing for a very
      large-scale investigation. I think we have to stand up as some kind of
      moral conscience at some point and I tried to wait until we had gotten
      enough verification from independent places to have some real confidence
      that this was widespread.  I know we've gone like a house afire to try
      to pack as much as I could in for you. I hope it's given you some things
      to think about and some new ideas and I appreciate being with you.
      [Long sustained applause]
