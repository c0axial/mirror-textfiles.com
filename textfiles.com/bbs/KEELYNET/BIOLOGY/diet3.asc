       The use of  quick  and  safe  in  relation  to  losing  weight is an
       oxymoron: the two words are conflicting points.

       The best way is to set up a good  exercise  program  combined with a
       calorie control program.   You HAVE to know what you  do  (how  many
       calories you are  burning)  and what you consume.  Then adjust those
       two for weight loss.

       The only thing that burns calories  is  muscle,  so  a  weight  loss
       program based only  on  reducing  calories is self-defeating:   your
       body will burn  both  fat  AND muscle as you diet, and when you stop
       the diet, you will have less muscle  to  burn calories than when you
       started.

       You will likely get on that most terrible of all  cycles,  the  yoyo
       diet, where you  lose  weight, stop the diet, gain even more weight,
       diet, stop dieting, etc etc.  And you end up with a body that has no
       muscle tissue to provide shape/form  and  look like a doughboy.  The
       exercise route is the best longterm method.

       Plan on it  taking  a  long time to do it right.   A  pound  of  fat
       contains 3500 calories.   (YOU  calculate how many calories you need
       to burn for 35 pounds).  As a male,  you  don't  want to reduce your
       calorie intake below 1200 per day (females can go to  1000)  from my
       most recent readings,  otherwise your body thinks it is undergoing a
       'famine' and starts lowering your metabolism to survive.

       And how many calories can you burn a day?  Well, yesterday I ran 3
       miles, walked another mile, lifted  weights  for one hour, worked at
       the office all day.... total calories used was 3800.   That is for a
       43 year old male, 5'11", 182 pounds.

       All major activities  were measured to the minute (sports) and minor
       ones were estimated based on past experience.  I also weigh my food
       to the gram for tracking.

       On any program, you will lose a lot very fast then plateau.  That is
       mainly water loss that occurs with  most  major  changes  in  eating
       habits and activity levels.  Don't get discouraged by the plateau.

       Also, be sure   to   allow   yourself  the  luxury  of  pigging  out
       occassionally.  Plan a few, and except  a  couple opportunities that
       pop up.  *BUT*  calculate  what  it  cost  you  and  compensate  the
       following week.  Allowing  the  occassional pigout will allow you to
       feel human instead of like a prisoner  to  your diet.  It also helps
       to prevent the "I fell off my diet so I am a hopeless  case  who can
       never... etc" pain that strikes all of us trying to lose weight.

       BTW, I went  from  210+  to 182, and added a lot of muscle tissue in
       the process, so it is anyones guess  how  much  fat  I lost.  But it
       shows it can be done.  I have a lady friend who went from 330+  (her
       scales only went to 330) to 135 over a 3 year period  by strenuously
       exercising and dieting.  I call her 'The Lady Di' because she became
       quite thin and attractive...
