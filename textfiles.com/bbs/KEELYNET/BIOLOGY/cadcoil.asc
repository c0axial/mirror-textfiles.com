       Caduceus Coil Observations
       --------------------------

       Background
       ----------
       The first mention  of  Caduceus  coils we had heard was in the Cater
       book, `Awesome Life  Force'. Cater  here  describes  a  `laser  like
       pulsed beam of soft electrons' that is ejected from the coil, along
       with other bizarre  effects  such as levitation. Cater  states  this
       beam will radiate  in  a  longitudinal  pattern.  A Vangard Sciences
       document describes other odd effects  when  testing  Caduceus coils,
       namely space/time distortion  and,  again,  levitation.  Of  course,
       given these interesting descriptions, it just had to be tested.

       The first tests  were  carried  out rather unscientifically and most
       haphazardly. A make shift coil was  built  from  20  gauge insulated
       wire that used  a 3" rachet extension as a core. Three  windings  or
       cross-overs were used. Pulsed DC at 9 volts was supplied to the coil
       at an unknown frequency. Three VAC was measured across the coil. The
       effects, however unconfirmable,  are bizarre and worth mentioning to
       educate further investigators.

       The effects were: metal objects within  a  five  foot  radius became
       magnetized and the  tester  received  a  quite  obvious  skin  burn.
       Needless to say, the negative effects were quite disturbing.

       The second experiment used a 14" iron bar with 19 windings. Pulsed
       DC was used again at approximately 12 volts at an unknown frequency.
       No burns or  magnetism  was experienced. The only effect which could
       be attributed to  this experiment  (although  there  are  no  direct
       linkages) was that the house became `charged'.

       The potential in  relation  to the human body had  changed  and  now
       static shocks became   annoyingly   common.   This   effect   lasted
       approximately three months and then dissipated to a normal level. No
       other unusual going ons were happening in the house at the time.

       Recent Experimentation & Results
       --------------------------------
       More recent and better controlled experiments with the Caduceus coil
       were recently completed. Every drawing of the coil we have seen

                                      Page 1




       contained only three windings, so that's where we began. The
       first test involved the following components:

             - 7 inch ferrite rod         - 22 gauge magnetic wire
             - 8 volt 22,000 rpm motor    - 6 volt battery supply
             - 9 volt battery             - ELF Meter

       The magnetic wire   was  wound  around  the  rod  to  produce  three
       crossovers or nodal  points  along  the  core.  The  wire  was  then
       connected to the  positive  terminal of the 9 volt  source  and  the
       pulse mechanism respectively.

       The pulse mechanism  consisted of the motor output rotor pole rigged
       with a special  circular  fitting,   half   conductive,   half  non-
       conducting. The connection to the negative pole of  the  source  was
       then broken and attached to copper poles which rested (with a slight
       tension) on the  motor  output  rotor pole. This produced about 2000
       hertz, as measured by an oscilloscope.  The  waveform was distinctly
       spiked, as would be expected given the source.

       The ELF meter probe was placed approximately 7 feet from the rod and
       left at rest. The meter detects low frequency EMF  in  the  50  - 70
       hertz range, .001 milligauss to 50 gauss.  Beginning readings on the
       ELF were 1.2  milligaus.  The setting was a garage (late night) with
       the following mechanisms on: 150 watt  and 60 watt lights, 1500 watt
       space heater.

       A compass was elevated and placed directly behind the coil to record
       any magnetic field disturbances.  The looped end  of  the  coil  was
       placed facing to magnetic northwest. The coil was then energized.
       No immediate effects  were  noted.  AC  voltage measured through the
       coil was approximately .3 volts, much less than we expected.

       Within 5 minutes time, however, the  ELF  reading  had dropped to .2
       milligauss.  After eight minutes of time it decreased to .1, after
       twelve minutes it read a steady .0 milligaus.

       A noticeable decrease in the motor hum was noted after  13  minutes.
       After 15 minutes  of  operation  the  coil  was  de-energized.   The
       following readings were  logged after  shutdown  (nothing  moved  or
       touched):
                   After  1 min = ELF .1
                          5 min = .2
                         10 min = .3
                         15 min = .4
                         20 min = .5
                         25 min = .6

       The pattern repeated  until the reading had returned  to  1.2.  Iron
       nails that had  been  placed  around  the  coil  showed  no signs of
       magnetism.
       *******************************************************************
       An interesting psychic note: While the coil was in operation we did
       a walk through of the field (the strongest effects appeared to be
       within a 14  foot radius).  One of  the  Yuggoth  Investigators  had
       recently been through  a trip to England and had observed  and  felt
       the presence of  ley lines, so the impression was still fresh in his
       mind. He reported feeling a strong  ley  line  within  1 foot of the
       looped end of  the  coil.  The  line  orientation was  approximately
       north-south.

       *****************************************************************
       To verify the dissipation of 60 cycle and harmonic EMF was linked
       to coil operation and not a property of the 22,000 RPM motor, the
       coil was disconnected and the motor ran for a equal amount of time.
       No effect on  the  ELF  meter was observed. This appeared to confirm
       the fact that this dissipation effect was a property of the Caduceus
       coil.  This raised  many  puzzling   questions.   Could   60   hertz
       (appliance) radiated EMF be canceled by the use of  a properly tuned
       Caduceus Coil?

       Why had neither  of  the  effects noted in previous experiments been
       observed? What element had been key  to  the  60 hertz effect - wire
       turns, input frequency,  orientation,  voltage or a  combination  of
       all?  We decided  it  was  time  to  get  serious.  Since  no  other
       documentation existed on the Caduceus  coil,  we figured it was time
       to write some.

       The following equipment  was  secured  in order to  put  this  thing
       through it's paces: - HP Signal Generator (1-990 MHZ)
                           - HP Frequency Counter
                           - Tektronics Oscope
                           - HP Function Generator

       Our thinking was:

            1)  We had to have much better control over the input source
            2)  Needed a wider range of input freq/voltages
            3)  Needed  to  establish  better  testing  of  effect  &  coil
                properties while energized
            4)  Devise some type of canary (as a means of sensing hazards)
            5)  Begin all over to answer the questions listed above

       Number 4 came about because of a Yuggoth Investigator's brother who
       had stopped work to eat lunch. He  didn't  realize he was perched in
       front of a microwave dish until he began to feel a  bit  hot (powers
       of observation not withstanding).

       The point was  well taken, but beyond the ELF, Compass, common sense
       and the body's ability to quickly transmit pain, we knew of no other
       way to protect the lily white of our rears.

       One interesting idea we had for measurement  is  connecting  the ELF
       meter, or alternatively a large wrap of magnetic wire,  and  use the
       scope to monitor  wave  changes  and  increase  the  frequency range
       available to us.

       Frequency sweeping of the Caduceus coil is currently underway. All
       progress will be made available as documented. We expect completion
       by March.
