                        Getting a cold? Take some vitamin C

               Vitamin C is a nutrient essential to our well-being.

       For many years vitamin C was connected only with scurvy,  but  since
       the advent of  Dr.  Linus  Pauling's work, "Vitamin C and the Common
       Cold," many of us have become familiar  with  the  effectiveness  of
       vitamin C in preventing cold.

       The versatility of this vitamin makes it available  for  use  in the
       treatment of many other cases of disease and distress.

       Pauling reports that  optimum  intake  (determined  on an individual
       basis) decreases the  morbidity  and  mortality  of  heart  disease,
       cerebro-vascular disease and cancer, as well as infectious  diseases
       in general.

       As a non-specific  detoxifying  agent  it  nullifies the toxicity of
       drugs, fluorine, saccharine, lead, carbon tetrachloride, benzene and
       excessive intake of vitamins A and D.

       It has been used successfully in the  treatment of ulcers, radiation
       sickness, rheumatic fever,  scarlet  fever,  pancreatitis,  whooping
       cough and tuberculosis.  Pauling  concludes  that  it  has  value in
       controlling essentially all disease.

       The most recent incidence of this  ability is in the lowering of the
       incidence of crib death. New Age magazine reports  a  study  done in
       one Australian town  known  for its high infant mortality rate where
       crib deaths "were virtually wiped  out  for  10  years  by infecting
       babies with 1,000mg of vitamin C each day."

       More evidence to  this  conclusion  is  a  nine-year  study  made in
       California. Investigators interviewed  577  persons  of  50 years or
       older, getting data   related  to  environmental,   behavioral   and
       nutritional factors.

       As these people  died,  records  were  made  as  to  the correlation
       between the factors and the age of  death.  Vitamin  C level had the
       greatest correlation with  age-correted death factor,  even  greater
       than cigarette smoking,  with those with a higher C intake living an
       average of 10 years longer.

       Vitamin C, ascorbic  acid, is produced  from  a  chemical  reaction,
       which yields a  substance  that participates in nearly  all  of  the
       chemical reactions in   our   bodies   and  in  all  the  protective
       mechanisms. It is not a "wonder drug."

       Drugs are developed for specific and singular effects and often have
       side effects which are harmful to  normal bodily functions.  Vitamin
       C is a normal constituent of the body required for life.

       The major function  of  vitamin  C  is  the synthesis  of  collagen.
       Collagen is a  protein  fiber  found throughout the body' connective
       tissue. Supporting, protecting   and   cementing   all  the  organs,
       collagen prote¼ts the body.

       It strengthens the intercellular cement holding the body together in
       various tissues by sending tiny fibrils throughout  this  cement  in
       much the same   way   as   steel   girders  are  used  to  reinforce
       construction cement. This   strengthening   is   effective   against
       cellular invasion.

       Vitamin C is  also  involved  in  the  synthesis  and   releases  of
       adrenocortical and pituitary   hormones.  It  accelerates  cortisone
       production. It is a natural antibiotic  and  can be used against any
       infection without side effects.

       Many animals manufacture  their own vitamin C. In  fact,  man,  some
       types of monkeys,  the guinea pig and an indian fruit-eating bat are
       the only mammals known to require  vitamin  C from external sources.
       Other mammals and  most  birds,  amphibians  and reptiles  have  the
       ability to synthesize the vitamin.

       Some geneticists, as  well  as  Pauling,  theorize  that we lost our
       ability to manufacture our own C  through  genetic  mutation. One of
       the proofs of this theory is that even now we are missing  only  one
       enzyme necessary to   complete  a  chemical  conversion  to  produce
       vitamin C in the liver.

       In a weight  ratio  th the amount  of  C  produced  by  synthesizing
       mammals, a man weighing 154 pounds would produce 4  grams  (4,000mg)
       daily in an unstressful situation.

       Symptoms such as  hay  fever,  canker  sores,  occasional headaches,
       bleeding gums or stress can be a sign  of vitamin C deficiency. Even
       the excitement generated  by  an athletic contest  can  deplete  the
       kidneys of their store of C.

       Signs of a deficiency can be loss of appetite and weight, failure to
       grow, muscular weakness, anemic and even skin lesions.  Further

                                      Page 2





       clues are bleeding gums, frequent colds and infections and recurring
       bruises.

       There are certain circumstances under which large doses of vitamin C
       must be taken  to  avoid  serious  deficiency: severe illness and or
       stress, surgery, accidental wounds and burns.

       Some drugs can cause the destruction of vitamin C in the body for an
       long as six weeks following their  use.  These include barbiturates,
       adreniline, stibestrol, estrogen,  sulfonamides, aluminum  chloride,
       aspirin, antihistamines, thiouracil, thyroid and atropine.

       These days, vitamin  C  is  most  famous  for  its action to prevent
       colds. Fatigue, becoming chilled,  wearing wet shoes or clothes, and
       air pollution can lower the body's resistance.

       Ninety percent of  all  americans  ar  familiar with  the  sniffles,
       sneezing, sore throat,  etc. of the common cold.  (Six to 10 percent
       never contract colds due to their natural powers of resistance.)

       In this country we average three colds  per  person per year, and we
       spend a whopping $500 million per year on cold remedies.

       Many of these  popular  drugs,  available without prescription,  are
       both harmful and dangerous causing illness and even death. Their use
       does not control  the  infection,  only the symptoms. Vitamin C gets
       rid of the symptoms by fighting the  infection, with no harmful side
       effects.

       Studies have been done to investigate the usefulness  of  vitamin  C
       against colds. Time after time it has proven effective.

       Dr. Edme Regnier,  who  conducted  a successful five-year study, and
       irwin Stone, who  originally told  Pauling  about  the  benefits  of
       vitamin C, both  believe that it is effective in large  amounts  and
       that the amount  of  protection increases with the amount of vitamin
       C. They recommend that 4 - 10 grams  be  taken daily at the onset of
       cold symptoms.

       Pauling recommends that we carry 1 gram of C with us  at  all times,
       taking one or two tablets at the onset of a cold and continuing this
       procedure for several hours.

       If there is  a  quick disappearance of the symptoms, after the first
       or second dose, we return to our  regular  intake.  If we still show
       symptoms the second day, we continue the procedure. Viral action can
       be suppressed, so the regimen needs to be continued  long  enough to
       rid the body of the virus.

       Vitamin C can be used to stop a cold whether or not one is taking it
       regularly, but again  several  grams  must be taken at the onset. In
       this case, the procedure should be  continued every 20 or 30 minutes
       until the symptoms  disappear. Then the dosage should  be  decreased
       gradually.

       Control of colds  would  lead to a decrease in more serious diseases
       which sometimes occur when a cold  gets out of had. In fact, Pauling
       believes that colds  could  be  prevented  in  90   percent  of  the
       population with the use of vitamin C.

                                      Page 3





       The same measures  recommended  for  prevention of colds are used to
       avoid the flu.

       If you areÿa would-be victim of the  flu  or  cold,  don't just take
       your C and keep working. Get some rest and drink lots  of fluids. In
       this way you  will  avoid  any  possibility  of serious illness and,
       equally important, you avoid spreading  the  virus  around to others
       who may be susceptible.

       As demonstrated by  its  effectiveness  with  the  common  cold  and
       influenza, both viral  infections,  vitamin  C  does  have a general
       antiviral action.

       Akira Murata, a Japanese microbiologist, using 20-gram injections of
       sodium ascorbate (a salt of ascorbic  acid) found that several kinds
       of virus were  inactivated  to  more  than 99 percent  within  10-20
       minutes in adult human beings.

       Because vitamin C stimulates action in the body's natural protective
       mechanisms, more white  blood  cells  are  produced. This means that
       vitamin C is  effective  against   bacterial   as   well   as  viral
       infections.

       Vitamin C has been recorded as successful in combating the following
       diseases: viral pneumonia,  hepatitis, poliomyelitis,  tuberculosis,
       measles, mumps, chicken  pox, viral pneumonia, viral orchitis, viral
       meningitis, shingles, fever  blisters,  cold  sores,  canker  sores,
       diphtheria, tetanus, staphylococcus, vaccunia virus and herpes.

       As mentioned earlier,  vitamin C is extremely important  or  direct
       physical stress: surgery,  accidental  wounds and burns.  Because of
       its function in the formation of collagen,  the speed of and tensile
       strength of tissue  is  directly  proportional to the  amount  of  C
       obtained.

       Vitamin C accelerates the formation of new blood vessels at the site
       of the injury.  It  also  activates  the healing enzymes, speeds the
       formation of new proteins and helps to prevent hemorrhaging.

       It follows that here is a great  need  for  increased  amounts  of C
       before surgery. Some  surgeons  suggest  that  5  grams   of  sodium
       ascorbate be included per liter of intravenous fluid.

       The use of  C  decreases  the  amount of post surgical pain, and the
       time required for  the  resumption  of  normal  body  functions.  Of
       course, it accelerates  healing,  and  it decreases  hospitalization
       time.

       How much vitamin  C should a person take under normal circumstances?
       According to Earl Mindell's "Vitamin  Bible," daily doses most often
       used are 500mg to 4 grams. One of the most widely used  supplements,
       it is available in conventional pills, time-release tablets, syrups,
       powders, chewable wafers  and  just about every other form a vitamin
       can take.

       Because vitamin C is excreted in two or three hours, it is important
       to either take it in a time-release  form or else take it throughout
       the day. Large doses of vitamin C can alter the results of


                                      Page 4





       laboratory tests. Before  blood  or urine testing, the doctor should
       know if you are taking vitamin C.

       The body's ability to absorb vitamin  C  is reduced by smoking (each
       cigarette destroys 25-100mg),   stress,  high  fever,   antibiotics,
       cortisone, aspirin, pain  killers and inhalation of DDT or petroleum
       fumes.

       Cooked foods retain about half the vitamin C of raw foods.

       Vangard Note...

            Some research doctors have  been  trying  to  treat  HIV (AIDS)
            patients with  high  doses of vitamin C. Some  have  used  many
            thousands of  grams  of  C.  This  can be very dangerous to the
            patients.  The vitamin C is very quickly absorbed by the virus.

            This in not meant as a cure for  the  HIV but to aid the immune
            system.

            Also it is best to use a liquid or chewable vitamin C.  As this
            will very  quickly  be absorbed in the body and  is  much  more
            efficient than the pill form.

            Do you know how Englishmen got to be called Limey's?

            A long  time  ago  when  the  English  sailors were out at sea,
            scurvy was a common problem.   The  only  source  of  vitamin C
            available to them, was from eating limes.  Thus  came  the term
            LIMEY'S!
