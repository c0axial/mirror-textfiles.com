            The following  article  on the work of Dr. Robert Koch was
       retrieved from the   legendary   Vangard   Sciences   archives,
       (A.K.A.) the pile of junk.

            There have been many stories written about Dr. Koch.  Most
       of them came from the state of Michigan in the 1940's.   When I
       return to Michigan  this  year  I  will  look  up some of these
       articles and put them on the KeelyNet for you.

            My father was a student at  the  University  of Detroit in
       the early 1930's and remembers Dr. Koch very well. He said that
       Dr. Koch was quite outspoken and quite controversial  about his
       research.  Although he   was   very   much  respected  for  his
       research.

            As of this date the formula  that  Dr.  Koch  was using is
       still known.   We know someone who has the formula  but has yet
       to release it. I don't know why someone would want to just keep
       it for and  not  distribute it to help others.  If they are not
       going to profit for it, then they should just give it away.  We
       hope you find this article of use.

                             EXTENSION OF REMARKS
                                      OF
                             HON. WILLIAM LANGER
                               OF NORTH DAKOTA
                      IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
                             Monday, June 7, 1948

            Mr. Langer. Mr. President.   I  hold in my hand an article
       which appears in  the  current  issue  of  a Lutheran  magazine
       called the Eleventh  Hour,  published  by the Lutheran Research
       Society of Detroit, Michigan.    This  article  bears the title
       "The Koch Treatment."

            It describes   the  science  developed  by   Dr.   William
       Frederick Koch, of   Detroit,   Mich.,  for  the  treatment  of
       prevailing diseases to which our twentieth-century civilization
       is heir.

            I have personally watched  the  progress of this system of
       treatment over a period of years.  I feel that it  is deserving
       of the attention of everyone who is interested in the health of
       the American people.
                                    Page 1




            I therefore   ask   unanimous   consent   to   have   this
       illuminating document printed in  the Record at this point as a
       part of my remarks.

            There being no objection, the article was  ordered  to  be
       printed in the Record, as follows:

                              THE KOCH TREATMENT

            Fortunately for   Canadian  farmers  in  the  Province  of
       British Columbia, the Minister of the Department of Agriculture
       possessed an open mind.

            This fact is saving cattle  raisers  into  the millions of
       dollars annually.   It is assuring them of better cows, steers,
       and beef than previously known.

            Such ailments  as  Bang's  disease, Johne's  disease,  and
       other fatal diseases  that customarily make devastating demands
       upon dairy herds  are  no longer  fatal  in  British  Columbia.
       Thanks to the  integrity and foresight of Canadian  physicians,
       veterinarians, and Government  experts who recently completed a
       series of successful  experiments  with  the  Koch  system  for
       treating virulent  diseases.  More about these investigations a
       little later.

            But, be  it  known  as a further warning against trying to
       suppress truth, that farmers in  various  parts  of  the United
       States are rising  up in indignation, demanding  the  right  to
       enjoy the same  advantages as their Canadian brethren.   Cattle
       raisers in South American countries,  notably  Brazil, have for
       years demonstrated the validity of the Koch treatment.

            As an index to the stir now being created by  American men
       of the soil,  your  editor  has before him a document which may
       well become one of historical importance.    It  is a petition,
       drawn up by  a  group  of  Michigan farmers and  submitted  for
       signature to members  of State legislature for their respective
       districts.   It is dated April 1948, and says:

            "We the  undersigned  members   of   the   Michigan  State
       legislature respectfully petition the Congress  of  the  United
       States, through an  appropriate  committee  to  investigate the
       injunction imposed by  a Federal  court  on  William  Frederick
       Koch, Ph. D.  M.D.,  a  pioneer  in the field of  research  and
       treatment of cancer, inasmuch as recently discovered methods of
       treatment confirm the  research  of  Dr.  Koch, with the end in
       view of requesting the Attorney General of the United States to
       have said injunction dismissed,  so  that Dr. Koch can continue
       further research and    practice    in   his   field    without
       restriction."

            The document bears the signature of 25 legislators.

            More about Dr. Koch's persecution a little later. * * *

            Suffice to say that Michigan farmers are not letting their
       herds die while  waiting  for bureaucrats to lift an injunction
       that should never  have been imposed.    They  are  using  Koch
       therapy anyway, thereby saving themselves and the public

                                    Page 2




       substantial sums of  money  in terms of cattle, beef, and dairy
       products.

            Injustice temporarily denies  the  learned  physician  the
       right of recommending his treatment.   But men living  close to
       nature, who know  values  when  they  see  them,  are using the
       discovery just the same.

            This reminds us of the man  of  old who insisted the world
       was round and that it moved on its axis.   In stocks, suffering
       excruciating pain, he cried out that his tormentors  were right
       the earth was  flat  and  stationary.    But  when  given  this
       freedom, he confided to a friend that the earth had been moving
       all the time.

            Denial of the earth's rotundity  did  not  cause the solar
       system's wheels to stop.

            Dr. Albert  L.  Wahl,  a  New York physician  of  enviable
       attainments says in  his  book.   A Least Common Denominator in
       Antibiotics: "In the philosophy  of medicine, the last word has
       not been said.   Nor of course, is it presumed that the present
       writing; encompasses the final dictum.   But in  the  words  of
       the Old Testament,  `God  has  worked a new thing, and this new
       thing ( the  Koch  treatment ) is  substantiated  by  extensive
       clinical observation.   And  the  facts  press  hard  upon  our
       present concepts, not  only  of  clinical pathology, but of the
       chemistry of immunity,  and  clamour  for  a  revision  of  our
       philosophy of medicine."

            Dr. William  J. Hale of the Dow Chemical  Co.  says:  "Dr.
       William Frederick Koch is the modern Pasteur."

            Prof. Joseph Maisin of Louvain University, Beigium, stated
       to the Canadian  Cancer  Commission  in 1940: "The Koch formula
       should not be called MERELY a  cancer  cure.    It  is  a  very
       important step in  medicine  and  is  apt to change  the  whole
       picture of medicine  and pathology. Dr. Koch is doing wonderful
       things."

            It is an interesting story  how  Koch  therapy began to be
       applied in animals:

            Dr. D.  H. Arnott, of London, Ontario, first  applied  the
       system in the  cure of human diseases in 1926. Other physicians
       and scientists became deeply interested  in the cures effected.
       While convinced that  Dr. Koch had discovered  new  and  useful
       therapeutic chemicals, the kind of data customarily accumulated
       by animal experiments  was  lacking.   This  led to the amazing
       results that farmers are now enjoying.

            The Honorable K. C. MacDonald,  Minister of Agriculture of
       British Columbia, called  a  group  of  experts   together   at
       Vancouver on October  4,  1944.    It  was agreed that the Koch
       method of treating diseases which were then ravaging fine dairy
       herds, should be carefully studied.

            Two divergent views were expressed at this meeting:
             (1).  Educational,   scientific,    and    administrative
                   authorities present, took the position that reports
                   of cures were fantastic and too good  to  be  true.
                                    Page 3




             (2). Practical    men,   farmers   who   had   seen   the
                  demonstrations with  their  own eyes, testified that
                  results were being realized exactly as claimed.

            On page 16 of his 1944 report, the Minister stated: "There
       were many dairymen present who made astounding  claims  for the
       Koch treatment.   In  practically  all  cases the dairy claimed
       that their cows responded almost  immediately.    These  cattle
       owners were emphatic in their request that no  action  be taken
       which would prevent   their   obtaining  Koch  treatments  when
       required."

            One leading breeder told how  the Koch treatment had saved
       an especially good cow given up to die.   He explained  that it
       developed mastitus during  lactation.    A  veterinary  surgeon
       advised him to  have  the animal  removed  from  the  herd  and
       slaughtered.  There was danger of the infection spreading.

            Instead, the  Koch  treatment  was applied.    The  action
       consisted of one   dose   of   the  therapeutic  reagent  being
       administered by hypodermic syringe  under the skin of the neck.
       Recovery was instantaneous and within a week the cow's milk was
       being sold to the creamery.

            Other breeders relate similar experiences.    Thereupon it
       was unanimously agreed   that  the  Department  of  Agriculture
       should investigate the merits  of  the  system.    The official
       declaration appears on page 16 of the agricultural department's
       1944 report: "The  Minister stated that it was  his  desire  to
       form an opinion based upon accurate investigations and he named
       a committee to under take this investigation."

            Mr. MacDonald's words of instruction were: "I am Minister,
       and gentleman, I am determined to get at the truth."

            Two veterinarians   were   appointed  by  members  of  the
       committee to work together.   Animals  were  to be examined and
       their diseases classified.    It  was agreed that  no  clinical
       problem would be  rejected  because  of  the  severity  of  the
       disease.   The joint  opinion   of   the   owner  and  the  two
       veterinarians was to  be accepted as final.    Field  work  was
       begun in November  1944  and  completed  in September 1945.   A
       Government laboratory and a private  laboratory duplicated each
       other's work and  checked  up  on  the bacteriology  and  other
       analyses required for the test.

            The results were nothing short of astounding to members of
       the committee.   Everything that the Koch Laboratories, located
       at 8181 East Jefferson Avenue, in Detroit, anticipated, came to
       pass.   It was  fitting  that the final report published by the
       Government of British  Columbia   should   have   contained   a
       statement by Dr.  Arnott.   He  summed up the  Koch  theory  of
       treatment as follows:

            "Life is promoted, sustained, and reproduced by the use of
             food. For  good  health  the  supply  must be adequate in
             amount and in variety. For  the best normal results it is
             necessary that the food be well digested  and  also  that
             the potential  energy  contained  therein  be transferred
             into living energy throughout the body at a vigorous

                                    Page 4




             rate, burning  the  food properly in each individual cell
             where it unites with oxygen for this purpose.

            "This living chemical reaction  is  spoken  of  by medical
             science as internal respiration, and it  must  take place
             continuously because   nature   has   not   provided  any
             reservoir wherein oxygen may  be stored, to be drawn upon
             at will  or  in  time  of  need.  It is upon  the  degree
             approaching perfection  with  which  food  is thus turned
             into living energy consistently that conditions requisite
             for good health are best  maintained,  that  diseases are
             best resisted, that life is best reproduced."

            "It is  Dr.  Koch's belief that a normal supply  of  these
             essential carbon  compounds  often  can be renewed by the
             hypodermic administration   of   the  reagents  which  he
             discovered."

            The committee adopted a closing resolution which contained
       the following commendatory clause:

            "That the  observations  justify  a  recognition   of  the
             working hypothesis  of  biological  oxidation of the Koch
             treatment, meriting  its   further   use   in  veterinary
             therapy."

            And so,  our  Canadian  friends  are  profiting  from  the
       wonderful achievements of the Koch science.

            Dr. Koch  began  the treatment of cancer in 1918 and other
       diseases later.

            He soon discovered interests existing in the United States
       that did not welcome recoveries  from  these  deadly enemies of
       society to reach the public.   Since that time  he  has  had to
       constantly beat down  the  opposition  in order to continue his
       work for the relief of suffering humanity.

            The fundamentals of the Koch  science  may  be  succinctly
       stated as follows:

              1. That the chemistry of natural immunity in the body is
                 able to destroy the toxicity of germs.

              2. When the body is invaded by toxic bacteria so full of
                 poison that  they  spill  over into the  system,  the
                 oxidation mechanism  must  burn  off these poisons or
                 the person becomes ill.

              3. The less able the system  is to burn, or oxidize, the
                 poisons, the  weaker the person becomes.    When  the
                 oxidation mechanism fails to burn off any poison, the
                 victim dies.

              4. The   Koch   Laboratories  have  developed  synthetic
                 antitoxins which act  as  a  catalyst  in helping the
                 body build up its oxidation mechanism  equal  to  the
                 task of   destroying  these  toxins.    When  natural
                 immunity is restored the person recovers.

              5. Cancer  behavior  is a protective response to a toxic
                 product generated   within   the   body.    Dr.  Koch
                 summarized the matter many years ago in  a scientific
                 paper form   which   the   following   sentences  are
                 reproduced:

            "Clinical observation discloses the persistence of toxemia
             over a period even as long  as  20  years previous to the
             advent of the growth.   After the growth  has  come these
             toxic manifestations  disappear,  or  nearly  so.   After
             surgical removal  of the  growth  they  return  and  with
             recurrence of the growth again disappear.    We designate
             these symptoms  as  the  pro  growth  symptoms,  for they
             differ from  those consequent  to  the  activity  of  the
             growth itself."

            "The strongest and the sufficient proof that  cancer  is a
             response of protection against a definite toxin, however,
             rests with  the  fact  that  removal  of  the  toxin  and
             destruction of the toxin  source  is followed by complete
             involution of all cancer tissue, complete  healing of the
             regions involved, return to health with absence of growth
             and pro growth symptoms, and the absence of recurrence."

              6. Diet  occupies  a  prominent  place  in the practical
                 application of the system.

            Testimonials like  the following  by  Dr.  Wahl  could  be
       multiplied to fill several large volumes:

            "Over  a year ago, my sister was dying of lymphosarcoma, a
             disease which the profession regards as invariably fatal.
             The diagnosis  was  made  by  Dr.  H. H. Permar, of Mercy
             Hospital Pittsburgh, Pa. on the basis of biopsy study No.
             1171, May 1, 1946.   The medical  staff of Mercy Hospital
             had perviously  made  a  diagnosis  of  lymphosarcoma  or
             Hodgkin's disease.

            "The case  was  far advanced at the time, my sister having
             been practically  bedridden   for  6  months  because  of
             weakness and recurrent infections. The masses of lymphoid
             tissue did not have to be palpated; they stood out on the
             sides of  her  neck  and in her axillae and  groins  like
             bunches of grapes mixed with walnuts.

            "When the  diagnosis of lymphosarcoma had been made, and I
             had received  written commiseration  from  a  top-ranking
             staff member of Mercy Hospital, it never  occurred  to me
             to do  other  than offer my sister the straw hope of deep
             X-ray therapy.    Everyone  who  examined her thought she
             would be dead within a few weeks.

            "I refused  to listen to my father's recommendations  that
             my sister  be  treated with a substance built up from the
             conjugated systems  of carbonyl  and  ethylene  linkages.
             Because of  American Medical Association   propaganda,  I
             believed that  the  results previously reported with this
             therapy approached the acme of quackery."

            "However, my father did have my sister treated, since he

                                    Page 6




             personally knew  of  cases of cancer which were cured and
             remained cured after its  use.  This  type  of  cancer is
             fatal in 3 to 6 months, as a rule.

            "My sister  was in the last stages and was  said  to  have
             only a few weeks to live, according to the best knowledge
             on the   subject.    She  recovered  after  one  dose  in
             characteristic fashion."

            "Then and there, I decided  to  undertake  an  independent
             investigation of  the treatment. I have been  irrevocably
             convinced of the great value of this treatment."

            "The American  Medical  Association  is  not yet convinced
             after 25 years. But that is an old story."

            William Frederick Koch was  graduated  bachelor of arts at
       the University of  Michigan  in  1909  and later  received  the
       degrees of master  of  arts  (1910),  and  doctor of philosophy
       (1917).   He received his medical degree at the Detroit College
       of Medicine.

            During 1910-13  he  was  instructor   in   histology   and
       embryology at the  University  of Michigan, and  for  5  years,
       1914-19, professor of   physiology   in   the  Detroit  Medical
       College.

            Comparisons are odious, but Dr. Koch has been described by
       authorities as "the  world's  greatest  living  chemist";  "the
       discoverer of a new science which charts the future  course  of
       the medical profession"; "one who cannot be bought, coerced, or
       intimidated"; "a Christian gentleman of courage and distinctive
       attainments"; and "a man of amazing capacities."

            No one who knows him well and understands the humanitarian
       spirit that animates   his   every  deed  will  deny  that  the
       foregoing descriptions apply.
