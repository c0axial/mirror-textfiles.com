                      "The mind is its own place, and of itself
                    Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven."

            So wrote John Milton in PARADISE LOST.  Whether or not he suffered
       from an emotional disorder, Milton sounds like a man who knew firsthand
       the torments and  elations  of  severe  mood swings.  If so, he was not
       unusual.

            Speculation on a connection between art and madness has gone
       on since the ancient Greeks.  Now,  a  small  handful of modern studies
       indicates there may be something to it.  In particular, they indicate a
       striking association between  creativity  and  manic   depression,   or
       bipolar illness.  The phenomenon appears especially pronounced among
       writers, particularly poets.

            Twentieth-century American poets have supplied poignant evidence
       for this.  Some of the best known -- Robert Lowell, Delmore Schwartz,
       Randall Jarrell and  Theodore  Roethke  --  were  diagnosed  as  manic-
       depressive or had histories of such behavior.  Quite a few, including
       John Berryman, Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton, committed suicide.

            Full-blown cases of manic-depression are characterized by episodes
       of uncontrollable hyperactivity,   often   accompanied   by   grandiose
       delusions, and longer periods of incapacitating, and often suicidal
       depression.

            The genetic component is strong: Among identical twins, whether or
       not they were raised together, if one twin has the illness,  the  other
       is 80 percent  likely  to suffer from it.  Manic depression afflicts at
       least 1 percent of the population,  and,  in  contrast  to  most mental
       illnesses, the rate  is  considerably  higher in the upper  social  and
       economic classes.

            Psychiatrist Nancy C. Andreasen of the University of Iowa College
       of Medicine is the first investigator to have used modern psychiatric
       diagnostic criteria to explore the relationship between mental illness
       and creativity.

            In the  early  1970s,  Andreasen completed a study of 15 topflight
       American writers at  the  prestigious   University   of  Iowa  Writers'
       Workshop and compared them with others matched for age,  education  and
       sex.  Ten of the writers had histories of mood disorders, compared with
       only two from  the  comparison  group.  Two of the 10 were diagnosed as
       manic-depressive, and almost all reported  mood swings, including manic
       or hypomanic (mildly manic) states.

            Andreasen has continued the study during the past 15 years,
       expanding the sample of writers to 30.  According to a recent report,
       the proportion of writers treated for mood disorders has increased to
       80 percent, compared to 30 percent of the comparison group.

            Forty-three percent  of  the  writers  had  some  degree of manic-
       depressive illness, as compared with 10 percent of the others.

            Alcoholism, which  is  very   high   among   sufferers  of  manic-
       depression, afflicted 30 percent of the writers and  7  percent  of the
       comparison group.  Two  of the 30 committed suicide during the 15 years
       of the study.   "Issues of statistical  significance  pale  before  the
       clinical implications of this fact," Andreasen says.

            The data on the writers lend weight to the finding of a 1983
       investigation conducted in England by psychologist Kay R. Jamison of
       the University of California, Los Angeles.  Jamison surveyed 47 of the
       top British artists and writers, questioning them about their mood
       states and their treatment history.

            Thirty-eight percent of the total had sought treatment for mood
       disorders -- a rate of about 30 times that of the general population.
       Writers experienced the most problems, and of these, poets topped the
       list -- with half od them reporting psychiatric intervention (drugs
       and/or hospitalization) for depression and/or mania.

            Almost two-thirds  of the playwrights had been  treated  for  mood
       disorders, mainly with  psychotherapy.  The rate for biographers was 20
       percent, and for artists the incidence was 13 percent.

            One-third of the 47 reported that they suffered from severe mood
       swings, particularly the poets and novelists.  Jamison reports that the
       biographers, the least likely to be associated with "creative fire,"
       reported no history of mood swings or elated states.

            More data on contemporary artists may be forthcoming from a study
       being conducted in Paris involving exhaustive personal interviews with
       about 50 artists, writers and musicians.

            Psychiatrist Hagop S. Akiskal of the University of Tennessee is
       collaborating in this  study,  which   will  compare  information  from
       recognized creative individuals  with  that  from  a  comparison  group
       matched for age, sex, background and achievement in nonartistic areas.

            Akiskal has already looked at 750 of his patients in the U.S. who
       are diagnosed with depression, manic-depression and schizophrenia to
       see if any subgroups showed different levels of creativity.

            He found  those  with  sever manic-depression showed high rates of
       antisocial behavior, including violent  crimes.   But  among those with
       more moderate versions of the illness, he found that  9  to  10 percent
       were creative artists and writers.

            Although most  investigators  believe  that  creative  achievement
       occurs despite, not because of, emotional  illness,  Jamison  says that
       "intense creative  episodes  are,  in many instances, indistinguishable
       from hypomania."

            The similarities suggest that mild mania can supply intense energy

       as well as  a  way  of seeing reality that, filtered through a creative
       mind and a discerning intellect, can  be  highly  conducive to artistic
       productivity.

            There are many elements that mood states have in common, sometimes
       including a sense of spiritual enlightenment that is reminiscent of
       certain mystical states.  Some other commonalities are:

            EMOTIONAL REACTIVITY.

            Both artists and manic-depressives tend to be highly  sensitive to
       stimuli both from the outside and from within.  Andreasen calls this an
       "extremely fine-tuned" nervous  system,  sensitive  to  a wide range of
       stimuli, including pain.

            She has speculated that this results  from  "input dysfunction" or
       "a defect in the cognitive mechanisms which filter stimuli."

            DISINHIBITION.

            Psychologist Ralph Tarter of the University of  Pittsburgh  says a
       "fundamental breakdown in  inhibitory  mechanisms" is characteristic of
       most psychopathological conditions.

            This breakdown, which can also  be stimulated by alcohol or drugs,
       leads to farfetched connections, and -- as is true in  many  artists --
       easier access to  unconscious  material.   Manic thinking flows freely,
       and includes man loose and novel associations.

            ABSORPTION.

            Hypomania is associated with  superior  powers  of  concentration.
       Harvard neurologist G. Robert DeLong, who studies children  with  early
       signs of manic-depression,  says that these children have significantly
       richer imaginations than most.  They  show  an  "unusual  intensity  of
       focus" when engaged  in  creative  tasks, which results  in  impressive
       feats of memory  and highly detailed drawings.  They can become lost in
       fantasies for hours on end.

            What of the emotionally ill -- are they more creative than
       average?  There is only one modern study that explores this connection,
       conducted in Denmark by psychiatrist Ruth L. Richards and psychologist
       Dennis R. Kinney of Harvard Medical School's McLean Hospital.

           Richard's and Kinney's subjects were 17 manic-depressives, 16
       cyclothymics (who suffer from milder forms of the illness) and 11 of
       their relatives with no psychiatric history.  Of 33 people studied for
       comparison, 15 were  illness-free,   while   the  other  carried  other
       psychiatric diagnoses.  Creativity   was   assessed    by    evaluating
       individuals' jobs and avocational activities.

            The researchers found that creativity was significantly higher
       among the study  subjects  -- manic-depressives, cyclothymics and their
       relatives -- than among the comparison group.

            Cyclothymics and relatives of manic-depressives showed the highest
       levels of creativity.  The researchers' conclusion:  "Creativity can be
       enhanced, on the  average,  in  subjects  showing  milder  and  perhaps
       'subclinical' expressions of potential bipolar liability."

            From these  studies  it  appears  that  a  tendency  toward manic-
       depression may facilitate  access,   in   creative  individuals,  to  a
       richness and intensity of experience that is not shared by the rest of
       us.

            More systematic investigation into their mental troubles would
       perhaps give us a less romanticized view of geniuses, but it would add
       to our understanding of how the morbid and the extreme among us have
       enlarged our perceptions of reality.
