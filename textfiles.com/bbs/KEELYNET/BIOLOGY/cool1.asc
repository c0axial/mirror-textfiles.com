            When crop  dusting  is  done in the late afternoon, the cockpit
       temperature may be as high as 125  degrees Fahrenheit.  Most plane's
       cockpits are not air conditioned because of the expense.

           Cockpit heat  poses  a  major  problem  because   elevated  body
       temperature can cause   fatigue,   dehydration  and  even  collapse,
       extremely dangerous possibilities  to  a  pilot flying at times only
       two to four feet above the vegetation.

           Available now  from Life Support Systems, Inc. (LSSI),  Mountain
       View, California is  a  lightweight  vest  and  a  companion  helmet
       headliner, Cool Head, through which  cooling  liquid circulates to a
       portable cooling package. The package includes a heat exchanger that
       cools the working fluid circulated through vest and headliner, and a
       control display unit   containing   a  pump,  a  liquid   reservoir,
       temperature control and  power  unit. Cool Head can operate from its
       own rechargeable battery or from the  airplane's,  or other vehicles
       power system.

            Cool Head  technology  originated  in  a 1968 NASA  deelopment
       progr¼m that produced a channeled cooling garment for space wear. In
       1971, NASA's Ames  Research  Center  awarded  a  contract  to Acurex
       Corporation for an extension of the technology involving development
       of a heat stress alleviating liquid-cooled  headliner for helicopter
       pilots.  In the  mid-1970s,  NASA  and the Bureau of  Mines  jointly
       sponsored an Acurex  program  for  development  of  a self-contained
       cooling system for mine rescue workers.   In  1980,  William Elkins,
       formerly with Acurex  and  long  associated  with   cooling   system
       research, formed LSSI to pursue commercial uses of the technology.

            Cool Head  personal  cooling  systems have been acquired by the
       Army and Air Force for use by personnel  who  must  perform  arduous
       work while wearing hot and bulky protective gear, such  as  garments
       to prevent contact  with  chemical/bacteriological  warfare  agents.
       Cool Heads have also been bought by  the U.S. Navy for evaluation in
       helicopters and light  aircraft,  and by military units  of  foreign
       governments.

            Among commercial  applications are use by employees susceptible
       to on-the-job heat  stress  in such  industries  as  primary  metals
       reduction, deep mining,   chemicals,   paper   and   glass.    Other
       commercial uses include   pe sonal   cooling   for  heavy  equipment
       operators and workers wearing toxic waste clean-up suits.  Cool Head
       is also being used by a number of auto racing drivers.
