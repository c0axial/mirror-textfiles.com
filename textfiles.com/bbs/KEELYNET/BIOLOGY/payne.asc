                   North or South or East or West Magnetism?

                            By Buryl Payne, Ph. D.

What and how to apply magnetic forces to the human body or other biological
systems need not be debated.  The question can usually be answered by
reasonably objective methods and some general principles.

About fifteen years ago, it was discovered that the body's muscles will
strengthen or weaken, upon the application of external or internal stimuli.
Many chiropractors developed and perfected this technique and it came to be
called "applied kiniesology", or more simply, "muscle testing".

In its simplest form, the person being tested holds one arm out in a
horizontal position and resists while a tester applies an even pressure near
the wrist to force the arm down.  When various stimuli are applied to the
body, such a colored lights, topical applications, foods, vitamins, mineral
preparation, or homeopathic remedies, are held in hand or taken orally, the
arm muscle will be noticeably weaker if that substance is not good for the
body, or stronger if it is good for the body.

Walter Rawls, Jr., patented the technique of using muscle testing to determine
the activity level of glands and organs by the use of permanent magnets.  This
system was further developed by Drs. Richard and Mary Broeringmeyer and used
to indicate which magnetic polarity ought to be applied to reflex points, or
at the sites of injury, as well at a particular gland or organ, to bring it
back to optimum functioning.

Years of experience by the Broeringmeyers, myself and other magnetotherapists
have validated the use of this system in determining what magnetic strength
and polarity is most effective for the body.  When pulsed magnetic fields are
used, muscle testing will also indicate the optimum pulse repetition rate as
well as the optimum intensity.  Usually pulse rate and gauss strength are not
sharply resonant parameter, but polarity is clearly indicated.

The technique is described in the authors's two books (see references).

The process of muscle testing is not completely objective, although when there
is a large difference it is usually unequivocal.  Its use has been expanded
and refined to include the testing of substances that might be applied on to
the body, to the body, or ingested for various healing techniques, and for
psychological diagnosis.

However muscle testing can be affected by the state or intention of the tester
as well as the testee.  When the difference between a "yes" or a "no" is
slight, subjective factors become more intrusive.

Muscle testing also requires the assistance of another person.  Although a
couple of muscle strength techniques for self testing have been devised, they
are quite subjective.

Now, a more objective means has been developed, called the Electronic Muscle
Tester.  This research instrument measures the pressure exerted between a
finger and thumb, indicating the result on a meter.  In practice of
magnetotheraphy, one applies on pole of a magnet, makes a strength
determination, then applies the other pole, making a second test.

The Electronic Muscle Tester is reasonably objective, after a little practice,
and can be easily self-administered.  It can also provide some indication of
relative intensity of a stimulus or treatment.  With the use of this
technique, there is no need to argue about east and west and north and south
magnetic polarity, on simply asks the body.

For example, in the case of a wound to the body, the first reaction of the
body is usually inflammation.  Treatment with the bionorth polarity is
indicated by muscle testing.  However, after the inflammation and pain are
reduced, muscle testing will indicate that treatment with the biosouth pole
is called for.  This will stimulate cell growth and healing.  The alert
magnetotherapist will watch for this transition, for to continue to treat with
only bionorth would probably slow down the healing process.  But in any case,
the use of muscle testing, no matter what means is used, provides the answer
in about 90% of the cases.

When muscle testing does not give clear results, yet magnetotheraphy is
clearly called for, there are four general principles which may be used as a
guideline.  These are:

   1.  The biosouth pole stimulates and promotes healing,
       growth and activity.

   2.  The bionorth calm, sedates, reduces inflammation and
       retards growth.

   3.  If it feels good, keep doing it!  If it doesn't help,
       or makes the condition worse, wait a short time and
       then apply the polarity.

   4.  Don't treat tumors, cancers or infections with the
       biosouth pole.

The different types of action which have been found to be associated with each
pole is briefly summarized in the following table:

   BioSouth Polarity

     Stimulates
     Tonifies
     Increases Circulation
     Dilates
     Increase Acidity

   BioNorth Polarity

     Sedates
     Inhibits
     Cools
     Soothes
     Slows
     Reduces Inflammation
     Shrinks Tumors
     Decrease Acidity

To simply expose each person to the same polarity, or to decide in advance
which polarity they should use, would be an error.  Ideally each person should
be able to self test and set the parameters for his or her own benefit.  The
technology now exists to do that.

Magnetism is mysterious to most people.  This makes it more difficult to use
in magnetotheraphy and other applications.
