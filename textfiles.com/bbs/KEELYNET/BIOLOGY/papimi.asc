                          Dr. Frome's One-Hour Aids Cure?

                                  by Joe Seldner
                      from 'Los Angeles Magazine', July, 1993


       It looks like  some makeshift gizmo out of Mr. Wizard: a wooden box,
       about the size of a steamer trunk, slapped together with one red and
       one green plastic button and one small  plate  of glass on top. Then
       there's that garden  hose-like  thing,  wrapped in black  electrical
       tape with a loop on the end, coming out the side.

       But it works like something out of Frankenstein. You know, where the
       grotesque patchwork cadaver  is  hooked  up to a glob of wires, then
       hoisted to the  very  top  of the laboratory  during  a  frightening
       storm, where it's pummeled by bolts of lightning until  it  comes to
       life.  Someone surely  had a perverse sense of humor to nickname the
       PAP-IMI-300 "Lightning in a Box."


       Although it was initially designed  to treat cancer and is currently
       used to bring  relief  from  pain, what PAP-IMI may--and  that's  an
       emphatic may--be is  another  kind  of  giver  of  life,  one in the
       treatment of AIDS.

       It must be  stated  up  front  that  no  one,  including  its  prime
       advocate, physician-pain specialist-lawyer entrepreneur Bruce Frome,
       is claiming Lightning in a Box is a cure for AIDS.  Nor is there any
       medical data on  what exactly the machine does. But  Frome--and  the
       patients who have  come  to  him  to be electrically charged by this
       oddly primitive device certainly believes in its potential.

       "If I had  AIDS, I'd get this treatment,"  says  Frome,  whose  many
       attributes don't include humility.  After all, it was  he who--as he
       puts it, simply  and unabashedly-"changed the photo industry" as the
       founder of Fromex, the one-hour photo-processing shops that continue
       to dot the local strip-mall landscape,  even though he no longer has
       anything to do  with them.  But Frome's lack of modesty  is  matched
       only by his patients' unwavering faith in him.

       "It makes them feel better," he says "probably prolongs their lives,

                                      Page 1





       certainly improves the  quality  of  their  lives  and gets rid of a
       great many opportunistic infections" that might otherwise kill them.
       If this sounds like a medical claim, it isn't, insists Frome.  In
       fact, as he and his colleagues at  his  Westwood-based International
       Pain Research Institute  await  permission from the  Food  and  Drug
       Administration to conduct  three-month clinical trials with the PAP-
       IMI on more than 80 AIDS patients,  at  this  point  there  is  only
       anecdotal evidence from patients to support the curative  powers  of
       the machine.

       Because the debate  over  AIDS  treatment  is,  if you'll pardon the
       expression, so highly charged, people involved in potential modes of
       treatment choose their words carefully.

       The actual inventor of the PAP-IMI,  Panos  Pappas,  a  44  year-old
       Greek physicist now on sabbatical from the Technological Educational
       Institute in Athens  and  based at Frome's institute,  describes  in
       energetic detail how his machine functions, but
       he stops short of fanciful conjecture about its applications.

       A short, balding  man with a thick accent, Pappas says the machine--
       which he invented in 1988 with the  intention  of  using it to treat
       cancer cells--is ''like  an  electrical  storm... that  changes  the
       coding of the HIV virus."  According to the thick document submitted
       to the FDA,  the PAP-IMI "induces an electric current that disperses
       electric charges or ionic concentrations inside biological tissue of
       the affected organ," causing "beneficial biochemical changes."

       In overly simplistic  laymen's terms,  that  means  it  charges  the
       cell's battery, making it better able to fight the common infections
       associated with AIDS, such as herpes, diarrhea and pneumonia.

       An expert in the study of lightning, Pappas, who  holds  patents  on
       many devices, including  ones  that  protect  ammunition depots from
       lightning strikes, notes  that "lightning  created  proteins  before
       life existed on  this  planet."  He insists his machine  can  reduce
       pain, make hair  grow  and  make  wrinkles  go away, all through its
       regenerative powers.  When asked whether  he would use it on himself
       to grow hair, he seemed surprised, replying, "Directly  on my head?"
       He did recover  enough  to  say  he  would  be  willing  to do so at
       frequencies lower than the 22,000 volts used on patients.

       When pressed about its AIDS potential,  in  fact,  Pappas  tends  to
       defer with a "you need to ask Dr. Frome about that."  Since Frome is
       providing money, office   space   and   exposure   for   Pappas--now
       officially a "consultant"  at  the   clinic,   working   on  further
       applications of the PAP-IMI-- the deference is understandable.
       Still, there is also something in his demeanor that says, "Look,
       I hope this  does  what  everyone wants it to do,  but  I'm  just  a
       lightning expert, okay?"

       Despite his hubris,  Bruce  Frome is a likable fellow, flitting from
       room to room  in  surgical  greens   that  do  little  to  hide  his
       prosperous midsection, a kind of swaggering Pillsbury
       Doughboy.

       His office is a tiny, cluttered, windowless chamber in the middle of
       the clinic's first floor.  In fact, much of the clinic,  which  just
       opened in January, still has the feeling of a household living out

                                      Page 2





       of boxes.  The  waiting room, though sparsely furnished, is awash in
       a sea of diplomas and declarations.

       Overachievement is something of an avocation for Frome.  In addition
       to an array of medical credentials,  including  a  medical degree in
       1962 from the  University  of  Manitoba  and  a  stint  as  head  of
       anesthesiology at Daniel  Freeman-Marina Hospital in Marina del Rey,
       the Canada native  holds  a  law  degree  (University  of  West  Los
       Angeles), a   doctorate   in   health   management  (Kennedy-Western
       University) and is--yes--a licensed real estate agent.

       The story of  how  Frome  founded  his  revolutionary  photo  house,
       Fromex, like the virtues of his PAP-IMI  device, depends on whom you
       ask.  His version has it that in 1979, executives from  the Japanese
       company Noritsu "came  to me" with the breakthrough photo-processing
       technology in hopes of getting a  U.S.   foothold.   Asked  why they
       came to a Los Angeles doctor, he repeats his mantra: "I was known to
       be an innovative guy."

       However, reports published  at  the time state that  a  relative  of
       Frome's saw the  technology  at  a  Canadian trade show.  When Frome
       heard about it, he was intrigued and  went to Noritsu.  Wherever the
       truth lies, what  is  not  disputed is that Frome opened  the  first
       storefront operation of  Fromex that year in Encino with his capital
       and their technology.  ("I was the  only  one  in  the world at that
       time.")  Quickly--perhaps too quickly--he sold franchises across the
       country.  He fondly  recalls  leaving  Daniel  Freeman  on  Thursday
       nights, "taking the  red-eye  somewhere, finding a lease and opening
       up a store."

       The company was undercapitalized,  and  three  years  and 108 stores
       later, the bankrupt concern was sold to a New York  businessman, who
       retained the Fromex  name.   Frome  is proud of the fact that during
       all of his other ventures, "I never  stopped  practicing  medicine,"
       and continued as chief of anesthesiology at Daniel Freeman.  But, he
       says, "most anesthesiologists  don't like talking to  people--that's
       why they go  into  it  in  the  first  place."  And  Frome wanted to
       concentrate on treating patients'  pain,  not on putting them under.
       So in 1987, he opened his first pain clinic, the Marina  Pain Center
       in Marina del  Rey.   Three years later, he teamed up with Atlanta's
       Premier Anesthesia, and  that  center   became  the  first  of  four
       National Pain Institute sites.  The other NPI clinics-in  Huntington
       Beach, Santa Monica and Atlanta--all opened within a year.

       A year later, however, he decided to sell his interest in NPI to
       Premier.  The research  he  was  doing,  he claims, was "risky," and
       NPI's shareholders wanted the more secure revenue stream of treating
       patients.  So he has taken that risk  at  his new center.  "Here, we
       do all the things nobody else does," Frome boasts.

       Apart from the  PAP-IMI, his innovations include extensive  work  on
       biofeedback and the  treatment  of  pain  with  a machine called the
       Pneumatherm, which, like  the  PAP-IMI,   was  invented  by  another
       researcher but put to use by Frome.  The Pneumatherm "heats the deep
       tissue," he says, penetrating as much as four centimeters instead of
       the one centimeter of more traditional treatments.

       Because the treatment  "fools  the brain into thinking  you've  been
       burned," patients generally fall asleep but awake refreshed and,

                                      Page 3





       they say, in  far  less  pain.   Frome heard of Pappas' work in late
       1991, while trying to find an innovative  treatment  for his father-
       in-law's brain cancer.  He was told--incorrectly--that  Pappas had a
       treatment for brain  tumors  that  was  not  available in the United
       States.  It turned out that the PAP-IMI  did  not  work  on brain or
       nerve cells but did have far-reaching pain implications,  and a six-
       month telephone correspondence  began  before  Pappas  came  to  Los
       Angeles in May of last year.

       If there are doubts about its value  as an AIDS treatment, Lightning
       in a Box seems to have nothing but support from his  pain  patients.
       Dennis Tanenbaum, an  L.A.  architect and engineer, was working on a
       project in Belize in 1985 when a  deranged  local,  for  no apparent
       reason, came up to him with a machete and hacked  off  his  leg just
       below the knee.  "I just sat there and waited to die," he recalls.

       After many doctors and much futile treatment to get rid of his pain,
       Tanenbaum was ready to give up and even considered doing himself in,
       when he came  to Frome late last year after learning about him in an
       ad for the National Pain Institute.  The PAP-IMI zappings to his leg
       stump have "given me my life back," he states.

       Then there's Tom Norris, a retired  military maintenance officer who
       says radiation damage from treatment for testicular  cancer left him
       in excruciating pain, nearly unable to move for two years and fed up
       with both military  and  civilian  doctors.   "The  military doesn't
       believe in pain," he laughs, and  doctors  at  UCLA told him to live
       with it because nothing could be done.

       "Dr. Frome was the first doctor I'd seen out of hundreds  who really
        cared about  me  and  gave  me  hope," Norris says.  After starting
       treatments with what he calls the  "electric doughnut" in January of
       this year, he says, "I now have a life, where I didn't  have  a life
       before."

       The PAP-IMI works   on   standard   alternating   current   and   is
       "noninvasive"--which means the patient  remains  clothed  and seated
       and simply puts the looped hose on his chest, neck or other targeted
       area.  As the current pulsates through the loop,  it  feels  like  a
       continuous minor electric shock--less intense than sticking a finger
       in a wall socket.

       The process appears  to  increase something called the transmembrane
       potential of cells--the voltage between the inner and outer sheaths-
       -from around 15  to 75 millivolts,  or  from  unhealthy  to  healthy
       levels.  Patients currently being treated for pain or other symptoms
       come in to  use the device for 20 to 30 minutes,  once  or  twice  a
       week.  In the  proposed clinical trials, there will be 36 treatments
       over the course of three months, each lasting 30 to 60 minutes.

       The effect, patients say, is immediate.   Fatigue  seems  to  be the
       first victim, with patients who normally go to bed  by  9  reporting
       they stay up  into  the  wee  hours  of the night of a treatment and
       still wake up refreshed.

       This relief may, of course, be just  a  "jolt factor"-something like
       drinking 8 or 10 Cokes.  And both patients and Frome  warn  that the
       rush wears off  fairly  quickly,  as  does  the impact on such other
       symptoms as diarrhea and lung infections, unless a rigorous

                                      Page 4





       treatment schedule is maintained.

       The first inkling   Frome  and  Pappas  had  that  the  machine  had
       applications for AIDS came when a  patient  being  treated for AlDS-
       related pain noticed that his Karposi's sarcoma lesions  cleared  up
       soon after using  the  PAP-IMI. "We thought, Hmmm, this is something
       we should look into,"  says Frank  Mingarella,  an  administrator at
       Frome's clinic.

       Though it has still been tried in only nine AIDS cases, the patients
       themselves are emphatic. "My life has changed dramatically  since  I
       started coming here,"  says Brett Smiley, a 37-year-old HIV-positive
       actor-cum-waiter, as he sits patiently  with  the loop on his chest,
       the machine gyrating   and  pulsating  away  like   Walter   Mitty's
       "pocketa" machine.

       Smiley says herpes outbreaks that used to last for weeks now go away
       in a matter  of days.  He, too, claims to have much more energy.  It
       is only when he says that his T-cell  count--  the  government's key
       defining factor for AIDS classification--has improved  that  doctors
       quickly intervene to  warn  against  jumping to conclusions.  It may
       increase T-cell count, says Frome,  but  that  is  precisely  why he
       wants FDA approval  for  clinical  trials  --to gather  evidence  to
       support the testimonials.

       Also, he says,  because  the  AIDS  virus  "multiplies so fast," the
       effects of the treatment may last  only  days,  or  hours,  with the
       infections, fatigue or  other  symptoms rapidly returning.   On  the
       plus side, no adverse side effects have yet been reported.

       Naturally, there are  skeptics.   Dr.  Castoria  Seymore,  chief  of
       anesthesiology at Daniel Freeman-lnglewood,  agrees that Frome "is a
       great entrepreneur."  But   he  reflects  the  medical   community's
       general opinion about  the new territory Frome is traversing.  "Pain
       is the big  thing  now,"  he says,  explaining  all  the  money  and
       attention Frome's clinic is getting.  But "I'd wait until I got some
       definitive data" before  trumpeting the virtues of  the  PAP-IMI  in
       AIDS treatment, he adds.

       Dr. Michael Gottlieb, who first recognized AIDS as a new disease and
       is considered one  of  the  country's foremost AIDS authorities, has
       one patient currently  being  treated   with  Lightning  in  a  Box.
       Although Gottlieb, now in private practice in Sherman  Oaks, says he
       doesn't know the  treatment  in  detail, from what he does know, "it
       doesn't make sense."  When we asked  if  he would recommend that his
       patients go to Frome, he said no.

       Then there's Steven  Kaali, of New York's Einstein Medical  College,
       who is also working on the effects of electromagnetic current on the
       AIDS virus--though his method applies electrical current directly to
       the blood through  a  kidney  dialysis-like procedure.  Kaali points
       out that an increase in a patient's T-cell count doesn't necessarily
       mean the patient is improving--the  count  can actually go up during
       an AlDS-related infection, as cells try to fight the  disease.   And
       Kaali, who says he is not aware of the device or of Frome's efforts,
       cautiously adds, "I  appreciate  everybody's results as long as they
       are reproducible.  If they are not  published and FDA approved, I am
       dubious."


                                      Page 5




       Scott Hitt, a  physician  at  Pacific Oaks Medical Group and a board
       member of AIDS Project Los Angeles,  cautions  that  "so  many leads
       like this go  to a dead end...  You have to cross-examine  the  hype
       before you hype it."

       Ironically, Frome seems  to  agree. "I have people coming out of the
       woodwork literally  every single day,  bringing me stuff - cures for
       cancer, AIDS, all  this weird holistic stuff."  In a  characteristic
       Frome flight from modesty, he adds,  "I seem to have a special knack
       to filter out  the  bullshit...  and  find out if something works or
       not."

       That, of course,  is  why  he  has  submitted  the  clinical  trials
       protocol to the  FDA.   Also, by submitting it as a  potential  AIDS
       treatment, it gets  "fast-track"  approval  or denial in the current
       AlDS-crazed climate.  (The FDA won't  comment  on  requests or other
       materials pending before it.)

       If Frome's radar  is working and the PAP-IMI does  in  fact  have  a
       significant effect on  the  AIDS  virus,  the  implications could be
       remarkable.  But the  down side is  formidable,  too.   Pappas  says
       Frome is "risking  his  reputation"  by  putting his  faith  in  the
       device.  Indeed, during  the  reporting on this story, several calls
       from colleagues at his pain institute tried to put a damper on Frome
       going public with his enthusiasm.   The reasons ranged from a "fear"
       that the clinic  would be besieged by AIDS patients  wanting  to  be
       part of the   trials   to  a  "concern"  that  the  FDA  would  look
       unfavorably on the clinic for "going  public"  before  the  approval
       process runs its course.

       But Frome clearly revels in it all.  One gets the impression that he
       sees himself  as  a cross between Ben Casey and Donald  Trump  (mid-
       '80s version).  He  takes  a  purse from a cabinet in his office and
       pulls out a small-caliber pistol.  A despondent pain patient gave it
       to him, he says.  She'd asked him  to  hold  it until she got to the
       point where her pain was so bad she'd want to use it.  Now she jokes
       about it, because her pain is gone.

       "He does feel  comfortable  about  what he is able  to  do,"  laughs
       Richard Jackson, chairman   of  Premier  Anesthesia,  which  put  an
       estimated  $6 million into Frome's  pocket with the NPI acquisition.
       But he insists Frome has the talent to match his ego.   "He's really
       a pioneer in medicine," he says.

       No one agrees  with that more than Frome himself. "I'm an innovative
       guy," he muses. "Everybody knows I'm  an innovative guy." And though
       he won't make specific medical claims about Lightning  in  a Box, he
       will say this: "The guys on the Nobel Prize committee are friends of
       mine," adding that  the  son  of one committee member was "sure that
       this thing is a cure for AIDS."
