           Amazing new device lets you listen to music - with your hands

       Japanese scientists have developed an astonishing new tape deck that
       incredibly allows people  to  listen  to music through their hands -
       instead of using their ears!

       The clever device, called SILENT  NIGHTS,  is  expected to have many
       applications.  For one thing, college students and  other people who
       like to stay  up  late  will  be  able  to  listen  to music without
       disturbing their family members or snoring roommates.

       It is also expected to be a boon  for  the  deaf,  many of whom will
       hear music and  voices with crystal clarity for the  first  time  in
       their lives.

       "Silent Nights is  THE  sound  system  of  the  1990's,"  said Takeo
       Nakamura, head of the team of acoustics  experts  who  developed the
       machine.

       "Unlike headphones and  loudspeakers,  which distort  sound,  Silent
       Nights delivers pure  music  to  the brain.  And because nobody else
       hears it, you can listen without disturbing a soul."

       Silent Nights looks like an oversized cassette deck but that's where
       the similarity ends.  Instead of  having  speakers,  the  machine is
       equipped with two palm-sized metal plates that deliver sound through
       the listener's hands.

       Nakamura refuses to  say  exactly  how  the device  works.   But  he
       acknowledged that it  generates tiny electrical impulses that "push"
       music into the nerves of the fingers and palms.

       The nervous system delivers these  impulses  to the brain, he added,
       where the music is heard in spite of the fact that  there's  not any
       external sound.

       Nakamura said: "My  partners  and  I  are  negotiating  with several
       manufacturers and hope to have Silent  Nights  in  production and on
       the world market by August or September at the absolute latest."

       Silent Nights is expected to retail for under $200.  Discounts could
       drop the price to the $150 range, Nakamura said.

       Vangard Note...

           This device  is highly reminiscent of Pat Flanagan's Neurophone.
           Though sound  can  be  passed   through   the  body  using  bone
           conduction, the article states that electrical  impulses are the
           key to the device.

           For those  who  study  such  matters,  we  can see definite mind
           control possibilities as well  as learning enhancement and habit
           conditioning.

           The basis of Flanagan's machine is detailed in MIND9 on KeelyNet
           courtesy of  Bob  Paddock.  Flanagan's machine  sold  for  about
           $1000 since   they   were   built  in  limited  quantities.   We
           understand that they are no longer available but we were offered
           two used Mark IV's for $1000 each  at a conference several years
           ago.  So  we  find the price reduction on Silent  Nights  to  be
           quite exciting.

           If the  device  does  accidentally  resonate  with  the  nervous
           system, then we should see some "anomalous" phenomena beyond the
           expectations of the inventors.

           We would  greatly appreciate  any  information  you  might  come
           across on either the technology, advertising or  general  claims
           of devices in this area.
