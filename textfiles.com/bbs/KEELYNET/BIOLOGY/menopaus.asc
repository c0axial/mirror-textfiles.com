                 A Family Practioner's View of the Menopause

         Menopause, because of the emphasis  on  youth in our society,
     is a difficult  stage of life for women.  Many of  the  emotional
     and physical changes attributed to menopause are, rather, general
     manifestations of aging  and  are  not  the  result  of decreased
     estrogen levels.  The   hope  that   taking   estrogen-containing
     medications would protect women from normal aging,  heart disease
     and other conditions  is ill-founded.  This essay will attempt to
     clear up some common misconceptions.   It  will briefly cover the
     physiology, symptoms and  treatment  of  menopause   and  related
     conditions, and issues  regarding  the  usefulness  and  risks of
     estrogen replacement therapy.

     PHYSIOLOGY, CAUSE, and SYMPTOMS

         The generally accepted definition  of  menopause  is one full
     year without menstrual  flow in a previously menstruation  woman.
     The incidence of menopause by this definition is about 10% by age
     38, 20% by age 43, 50% by 48, and 100% by age 58.

         The essential cause of menopause is less production of the
     female hormone, estrogen, by aging ovaries.  This results in
     cessation of menses    (periods).    Some   estrogen   production
     continues, mostly as a result of  non-ovarian conversion of other
     steroids.  This non-ovarian estrogen production may be the reason
     why 25% of women experience no menopausal symptoms.

     Hot Flashes

         This term describes an uncomfortably warm sensation that
     radiates up from  the chest to neck and face and lasts seconds to
     a few minutes  before  subsiding.   Eating,  exertion,  emotional
     stress and alcohol  are know to precipitate hot flashes.   It  is
     believed that hot  flashes  are  related  to the rate of estrogen
     withdrawal.  Menopausal women can  experience  up  to 20 episodes
     per day.  In most people, this symptom subsides after  2-3 years,
     but it may  continue  for  6  years  or  more.   About  10-35% of
     menopausal women suffer  from  severe,   disabling  hot  flashes.
     While no link  between  emotional  makeup and symptoms  has  been
     demonstrated, clearly hot  flashes can be a source of significant
     misery and annoyance.

     Atrophy of the Vagina

         As estrogen levels decline,  the  vagina  becomes smaller and
     less compliant and lubrication decreases.  This makes vaginal and
     urinary tract infection more likely.  It can lead  to symptoms of
     itching, painful intercourse,  discharge,  and  bleeding.   It is
     interesting that sexually active women show less vaginal atrophy.

     Cardiovascular Disease

         There is no evidence that estrogen decline is responsible for
     the increased incidence of cardiovascular  disease that parallels
     the menopause.  Data regarding the effects of taking estrogens on
     cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are conflicting.   The two
     major prospective studies  have  produced  opposite results, with
     one showing an increase in the risk of heart disease, the other a
     decrease.  This is a vitally important  issue...further  research
     is desperately needed to resolve it.

         There does   not   appear   to  be  an  increased   risk   of
     thromboembolism (the formation  of  blood clots) among menopausal
     women taking estrogens, but those  with a history of same who are
     taking estrogen preparations should be closely monitored.

     Osteoporosis

         Osteoporosis refers to a generalized weakening of bone that
     leads to an increased risk of fractures of various  types.  It is
     an important consequence    of   estrogen   decline.    Decreased
     activity, poor nutrition,  and the  general  aging  process  also
     contribute to the  development  of  osteoporosis.   Although  the
     process is irreversible  once established, it can be prevented by
     the prophylactic administration of estrogen.

     Emotional Disturbances

         Symptoms such as headache, nervousness, and depression are
     common during early menopause.   These  are  felt  to  be  more a
     result of the  emotional  stress associated with  this  difficult
     stage of life than of hormonal changes per se.  Some women report
     feeling better emotionally on estrogen therapy, but this may be a
     placebo effect.  No specific psychiatric problems have been found
     to be linked specifically to the menopause.

     Cosmetic Changes

         While breast  atrophy,  loss of skin tone, and redistribution
     of body fat to the abdomen and  thighs  have  been  attributed by
     some to the  menopausal  decrease in estrogen, clinical  evidence
     does not support this.  These changes are most likely part of the
     more general process of aging.

     MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF MENOPAUSE

         The objective   of   medical   practioners  in  treating  the
     menopausal women is to alleviate any disabling symptoms resulting
     from estrogen deficiency and to  provide  support for the host of
     emotional and functional problems that are often  associated with
     this phase of life.

     Estrogen Replacement Therapy

         Estrogen deficiency does cause serious medical problems, for
     example osteoporosis, and  estrogen  replacement  can be of great
     value in avoiding these conditions.   However, there are risks to
     taking estrogens, and the decision to administer  them  is  not a
     simple one and  requires  a "cost-benefit" analysis.  There is no
     one right answer; each woman, in consultation with her physician,
     must make the decision.

         First we will consider the risks of estrogen replacement
     therapy, then the  benefits  that   can  be  expected  from  such
     treatment.

     Risks of Estrogen Replacement Therapy

     -- Endometrial Cancer

          The major  risk  associated with this treatment  is  cancer.
     There is an  increased incidence of endometrial carcinoma (cancer
     of the lining of the uterus) in menopausal  women taking estrogen
     regularly.

          This risk correlates with the dose and duration of treatment
     and declines with cessation of treatment.  The risk is apparently
     not related to the type of estrogen administered.   What  is  the
     magnitude of the   risk?    Case-controlled   studies  reveal  an
     incidence of endometrial cancer  of  4.5 to 13.9 times higher for
     estrogen users compared to non-users.  Other studies  have  shown
     that at dosages of 0.625 to 1.25 mg of conjugated estrogens cause
     a seven-fold rise  in  the  incidence  of endometrial cancer when
     taken daily for 2 to 4 years.

         The mechanism  of  the  malignancies   caused   by   estrogen
     medication is related  to  the effect that estrogen  has  on  the
     lining of the   uterus.    Estrogen  stimulates  the  growth  and
     differentiation of the uterine lining such that if pregnancy were
     to occur it would be supported.   Prolonged, continuous use makes
     for excessive stimulation   inducing  a  state   called   "cystic
     hyperplasia of the   endometrium"   which   is   a  pre-malignant
     condition.

         The addition of another hormone, progestegin, to the estrogen
     program does help reduce the risk of endometrial cancer.

                                   Page 3




     However, it also causes the return of light to moderate menstrual
     periods and causes  an  unfavorable  change in serum lipoproteins
     which might lead to an increased  risk of cardiovascular disease.
     Large, controlled, long  term, prospective studies  are  not  yet
     available; such studies are needed to better determine safety and
     effectiveness.

     -- Breast Cancer

         This remains an area of controversy.  Some studies suggest an
     increased risk of  breast  cancer  with  the  use  of  long  term
     estrogen replacement therapy, other  studies show no such effect.
     What is know  is that women with the type of breast  cancer  that
     has "estrogen receptors" experience stimulated cancer growth with
     estrogen exposure, while  those  with  the  type of breast cancer
     without these receptors improve with estrogen administration.

     -- Cardiovascular Morbidity and Mortality

         We covered the high points of this risk earlier.

     -- Other Adverse Effects

         Administered estrogens  can   also   cause  fluid  retention,
     elevated blood pressure,  gallstones,  glucose  intolerance,  and
     headaches.  Recurrent uterine   bleeding   (which  can  make  the
     diagnosis of uterine cancer tricky) is also common.

     Benefits of Estrogen Replacement Therapy

     -- Disabling Hot Flashes

         As mentioned above, usually this problem is self-limited.
     Symptoms severe enough to be disabling are an indication for
     replacement therapy, and relief during the one or two year period
     in which the symptoms are usually  severe  can  be a blessing.  A
     program of estrogens in the dose range of 0.3-1.25 mg taken daily
     for three weeks with one week off will prevent hot  flashes.  The
     lower dose is  usually  adequate.  Addition of a progestin is not
     necessary if therapy  is planned  to  be  of  one  year  or  less
     duration.  Attempts to taper off the estrogens can  be  attempted
     every 3-6 months.

     -- Postmenopausal Osteoporosis

         This condition can be prevented by long-term prophylactic
     estrogen therapy.  Controlled    studies    clearly   demonstrate
     decreased rates of   vertebral,   wrist,   and   hip   fractures.
     Exercise, and good nutrition including enough calcium and vitamin
     D also slow  the  bone  wasting,  but  are  not as  effective  as
     estrogen.  Risk factors    besides    estrogen   deficiency   for
     osteoporosis include: tobacco,   heavy  alcohol  use,  thin  body
     build, and prolonged bed rest.

         The decision to use estrogens to prevent bone loss is a
     difficult one.  The condition is largely irreversible and resumes
     once the therapy  is  discontinued; therefore treatment  must  be
     begun when the menopause first manifests, and must be continued
     indefinitely.  Courses of   treatment  of  10-15  years  are  not
     uncommon.

                                   Page 5




          If a  woman  is  willing  to  accept  the  increased risk of
     endometrial cancer, the uncertain  cardiovascular  risk,  and the
     regular gynecological follow  needed  to screen  for  endometrial
     cancer in return  for  the  best  possible  means  of  preventing
     osteoporosis, then a program of  estrogen,  progestin,  exercise,
     and nutritional support  is  the  best  option.    It  should  be
     stressed that a  program  of  exercise  and  nutritional  therapy
     without estrogen *will* retard the  rate  of  bone loss and is an
     option for those unwilling to take estrogens.

     -- Atrophic Vaginitis

         The dryness, discomfort, and difficulty of sexual relations
     caused by diminishing estrogen levels in the menopause can be a
     serious quality of life problem for many women.  As stated above,
     sexually active women seem to have less trouble with this than
     celibate women.  The  atrophy  of the vagina and  vulva  responds
     well to estrogen-containing  creams as well as to estrogen pills,
     and though absorption  into the  blood  stream  does  occur  with
     topical application, certainly   the  risks  are   much   reduced
     compared to long  term  oral  replacement  therapy.   Use  of the
     estrogen creams, directly  applied  to  the  vaginal  and  vulvar
     mucosa (lining), restores  turgor  and  reverses  the  menopausal
     changes outlined above.

          However, because  the  risk  of  topical  estrogens  is  not
     completely known, prudence requires  the  use  of estrogen creams
     for short periods   in  response  to  severe  symptoms.    Milder
     symptoms, such as  mild  dryness  with intercourse, often respond
     well to common water-soluble vaginal lubricants.


     SO WHAT'S A WOMEN TO DO?

         Given the list of potentially serious adverse effects of
     estrogen replacement therapy, extreme care must be exercised in
     deciding to embark on a course of long term treatment.

          Certainly, disabling symptoms  should be treated.  Certainly
     the dose should  be  as  low  as  possible, and the  duration  of
     treatment as brief  as  possible.   For those who elect long term
     treatment for prevention of osteoporosis, a progestin drug should
     also be part of the regimen.

          Patients must  clearly understand  the  relative  risks  and
     benefits and make their own decisions.

          Patients who undergo estrogen therapy require careful
     monitoring.  Because endometrial  cancer is usually  asymptomatic
     in the early  stages, and because postmenopausal uterine bleeding
     is both a clue that uterine cancer  may be present, and because a
     common side-effect of estrogen therapy is bleeding, for all these
     reasons women who take estrogens postmenopausally  often  require
     repeated uterine scrapings  (D+C, Dilation and Curettage) both to
     monitor for the development of endometrial  cancer and to rule it
     out when symptoms of bleeding occur.  Indeed, a risk  of estrogen
     replacement therapy is  the  potential  increase  in frequency of
     endometrial biopsy and D+C procedures.  Women unwilling to follow
     what is often  a  rigorous  follow-up   regimen   are   not  good
     candidates for chronic estrogen replacement therapy.

         OK, that's it for now.  I think we've covered the basics.  Of
     course I'd be more than happy to answer any further questions as
     best I can.                                          ...alex....
