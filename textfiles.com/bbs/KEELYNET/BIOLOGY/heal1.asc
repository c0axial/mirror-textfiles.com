                         Science accelerates Wound Healing
                       an Interview with Dr. J. Alan Tanner

       .....Collagen is all  important in healing.  It is the material that
       gives mechanical strength to a healing wound and forms the scar.

       We carried out this experiment on a rat exposing a prepared wound to
       a MICROWAVE FIELD and we found that  healing was speeded up.  It was
       a repeatable phenomenon and we carried out hundreds  of  experiments
       with positive results.   And  if we wanted to accelerate the healing
       still more, we found we could achieve this by putting a small amount
       of HISTAMINE IN THE WOUND.

       This produces more  fluid in the  area  of  the  wound  and  enables
       healing to proceed more rapidly.  We've simply demonstrated  that it
       is possible to accelerate the normal process.  If the HIGH FREQUENCY
       FIELD is DIRECTED  TO  THE  WOUND, there is MORE FLUID from which to
       generate the FIBRIN and COLLAGEN,  all  important  for  the  healing
       process.

       A.E.  How does the high frequency treatment compare  with the normal
             time in healing a wound?

       JAT   You can  watch  the  healing  process  IN  REAL  TIME  under a
             microscope.  A wound develops  mechanical strength after about
             20 minutes of exposure (to microwave fields).  Normally if you
             cut yourself, it takes 48 to 72 hours to get  any  strength at
             all.

             Another advantage we found is that since there are no sutures,
             you're not INSULTING the skin, so you get a beautifully healed
             wound.  On  some of the animals, the dog, for example, we lost
             sight of some of the wounds.   They healed so well we COULDN'T
             EVEN SEE A SCAR.

       A.E.  Imagine the benefits of healing wounds without scars!

       JAT   Yes, WITHOUT SCARS.  Of course there are tricks  to the trade.
             We found that some wounds weren't healing as well as others.

                                      Page 1





             We couldn't   understand  this  but  again,  after  protracted
             experimental investigation,  we  found  it all depended on how
             well you APPOSED THE LIPS OF THE WOUND.

             We were using surgical incisions with clean, square edges, but
             we had  to make sure those edges were PERFECTLY  APPOSED.   If
             you left  an  air  gap  then  you'd  get  a weak point.  So we
             developed a tape that you could just put over the wound.

             In the tape are two electrodes.   They  don't  touch the skin,
             they're  insulated.   But  they  PROVID  THE  ELECTRO-MAGNETIC
             FIELD.  The  tape  also  holds the wound edges together.  This
             has proved to be very successful.

       A.E.  It seems  the  profession  of  medicine  has  access  to  this
             innovative healing device but won't investigate  it  to  prove
             its effectiveness, or to prove there's some risk.

       JAT   There's always  resistance to new methods in the medical field
             and perhaps, justifiably, I wouldn't question it.  When a body
             process is artificially SPEEDED  UP  the question arises as to
             what is the possibility of inducing some sort of malignancy.

             Experiments designed  specifically  to  answer  this  question
             would take two to three years.  There are many answers we have
             to come up with before everybody will be satisfied that it's a
             safe and sound technique to use.  I wouldn't object to this in
             principle.  I'm sorry that time is going by.

       A.E.  Is this method being used in other countries?

       JAT   We have  evidence  now,  in  France,  that  an elecrode design
             similar to ours is being manufactured there.  I don't know how
             widely it's being used in Europe, who knows?  But what we have
             to do in order to promote the  next  phase of the work in this
             country is  to  develop a means of measuring  the  quality  of
             healing a wound.

       A.E.  You have  a  deep  belief  in this device, that it will become
             your contribution to the human race?

       JAT   Yes, I certainly think ACCELERATED  WOUND  HEALING  will be an
             asset to  mankind  when it is used generally.   But  it's  the
             result of  curiosity.  It wasn't a guess, we knew, we expected
             this sort of change to occur  in the skin.  The reasons for it
             were quite clear, Dr. Romero just proved that he was right.

       A.E.  Can you give a simple explanation about why the  wound  healer
             works in terms of the electromagnetic spectrum?

       JAT   All I   can   say  is  that  the  normal  healing  process  is
             accelerated.  It's an electronic  process as it stands, and it
             appears that  we  are  simply  speeding  up  the   biochemical
             reactors.

             Body processes  are  all  controlled by membranes.  Every cell
             has a membrane around it that DIRECTS THE NUTRIENTS IN and the
             METABOLIZED PRODUCTS OUT.


                                      Page 2





             The function of a membrane is influenced by the presence of an
             electromagnetic field  and  in  the  case of epithelial (skin)
             structures the benefit obtained is accelerated healing.

       A.E.  You must be knowledgeable about  some of the experiments being
             done with  the  human  forcefield or aura, using  it  to  heal
             specific areas of the body, one's own body or another's?

       JAT   I'm aware  of  activity  in  this area and I think that in the
             future many phenomena today described as extra-sensory will be
             shown to have a firm physical basis.

       A.E.  What do you see as future uses of the wound healer?

       JAT   Ultimately, it could be used by the man on the street.

             He would  carry  a  little  high-frequency  oscillator  pocket
             sized, battery  driven, and bandages of different  shapes  and
             sized for   different  kinds  of  wounds,  all  of  which  had
             electrodes in them, and probably  the histamine or some analog
             of that which is needed to assist in the healing operation.

             The intermediate stage - I see hospitals using it for closures
             in surgical  procedures,  for  accidents, cases  in  emergency
             clinics with  great  advantages.  You'd have a faster turnover
             of patients in a hospital.

             The other use I haven't mentioned  is  COSMESIS.   COSMESIS is
             very important to the plastic surgeon.  With the wound healer,
             RAPID HEALING is achieved WITHOUT RESORTING TO  SUTURES.   The
             result is a cosmetically superior scar.

       A.E.  What is keeping it from general public use?

       JAT   We have completed an extensive experimental program on animals
             with positive  and  very  encouraging  results  but  now it is
             necessary to mount an experimental  program  on human subjects
             to satisfy the requirements of the medical profession.

             We must proceed according to the establishment's  rules.  It's
             a long  process  but I believe one day that all wounds will be
             healed in this way.

       Vangard note...

            This file makes reference to the use of histamines as a further
            method of assisting the wound healing process.  For those of us
            who are  subject to allergic  reactions,  we  know  that  ANTI-
            HISTAMINES are used to PREVENT THE EXCESS RELEASE OF FLUIDS.

            Exposure to histamines therefore induces the cell  membrane  to
            exude fluids  which  provide a more soluble medium for chemical
            interchanges.  In  addition,  the  fluid  medium  aids  in  the
            transportability of   other   components   such   as   fibrins,
            collagens, etc.

            This accelerated  healing process would make an excellent video
            to show the effects of the process on a real wound.  Most video

                                      Page 3




            cameras allow  the  addition of a date/time stamp or an elapsed
            timer as a further record.  Might  make  an interesting project
            for someone in the future.

            It is  probable that microwave excitation would  induce  intra-
            cellular heating  in  the form of very low level roiling of the
            fluid medium.  This would be  the  equivalent of turbo-charging
            the healing process by offering a greater number  of  exchanges
            over a shorter period of time.

            Those of  us  who  are  Star  Trek  followers can see what such
            procedures could eventually lead to.  An excellent beginning.

            We felt the contents and work presented in the paper should not
            be relegated to some dusty storage area to be lost.
