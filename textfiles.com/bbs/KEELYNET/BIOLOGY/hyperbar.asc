       Subject: FATIGUE RELATED TO HIV/AIDS
       From   : Jeffry Skidmore <wombat@u.washington.edu>

       ABSTRACT

       HIV-Related Fatigue and Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy
       Reillo, M, R.N., B.S.N.,

       Baltimore, Maryland, USA

       Objectives:   Hyperbaric Oxygen  Therapy (HBO) is being evaluated to
                     determine the effectiveness  in  relieving HIV-related
                     fatigue and  determine the clinical and  immunological
                     effects on HIV-infected individuals.

       Methods:      Twenty-five patients  have  been  enrolled over a two-
                     year period.    Admission   criteria   include   chief
                     complaint of fatigue, seropositivity  as  confirmed by
                     ELISA and  Western  Blot  for  HIV  infection, 500 CD4
                     cells or less, and  absence  of  active  opportunistic
                     infections which   might   compromise   pulmonary   or
                     neurologic function.

                     Twenty patients  received 2 ATA, for 90 minutes, three
                     times per week.

                     Five patients voluntarily  received surface air at the
                     same parameters to control for a placebo  effect,  and
                     then received  100%  oxygen; all patients were treated
                     simultaneously in the  HBO chamber.  Withdrawal of HBO
                     therapy for one month was completed for  21  patients,
                     secondary to chamber construction.

       Laboratory, clinical assessment,  and  Karnofsky  Performance Scores
       were completed monthly on all patients.

       Results:      All patients indicated  relief of debilitating fatigue
                     within two weeks.  Karnofsky Scores  improved  10%  to
                     30% within one month.  Weights for all patients

                     remained stable  or  increased;  CD4,  Hemoglobin, and
                     Hematocrit counts remained stable and/or increased.

                     Tumor Necrosis Factor  decreased  in 13 patients. P-24
                     antigens remained   nonreactive   or    decreased   if
                     reactive.  Withdrawal   of   therapy   for  one  month
                     secondary to new chamber construction for all but four
                     patients correlated  with  return  of baseline fatigue
                     levels.

       Additionally, two patients developed PCP and were treated outpatient
       with dapsone and HBO via monoplace chamber.

       One patient developed herpes zoster and was treated with zovirax and
       HBO via monoplace   chamber.   After  resuming  HBO   therapy,   all
       remaining patients returned  to  their  six  month  Karnofsky Score,
       which indicated significant improvement in their fatigue levels.

       Twenty-three of the twenty-five  patients  have  shown  no  clinical
       disease progression; 80% of patients enrolled in the  study  have 50
       CD4 cells or less.

       Further, HBO appeared  to  relieve  pain  associated with peripheral
       neuropathy in two  patients and was  a  beneficial  adjunct  to  the
       treatment of mild PCP; the investigators have established  protocols
       to further investigate these findings.

       Conclusion:   The study  is  ongoing. HBO appears to be effective in
                     relieving HIV-related   fatigue   and   improving  the
                     quality of life of individuals with HIV/AIDS.

       Preliminary research indicates  a  probable  correlation   with   an
       increase in length  of  employment  capability,  delayed  disability
       requirement, and reduction in number  and length of hospitalizations
       by incorporating HBO as a component in the medical management of HIV
       disease.

       The investigators believe HBO may relieve fatigue by  inhibiting the
       activity of certain  cytokines, enhancing red blood cell production,
       and enhancing the ability of HIV-impaired  monocytes  to  absorb and
       utilize oxygen.

       The Center for Advancement of Hyperbaric Medicine  is  a  Washington
       corporation and has  filed  for IRS non-profit status as a 501(c)(3)
       organization.  CAHM's goals are:

          1. To promote the acceptance and broadest appropriate application
             of hyperbaric  oxygen  therapy  in  the  professional  medical
             community.

          2. To research and promote the research of promising applications
             of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in a manner that  will insure its
             highest professional recognition and acceptance.

          3. To collect, organize and disseminate all available information
             about hyperbaric  oxygen  therapy  so  as  to  insure its most
             knowledgeable application and implementation.

          4. To  discover,  research,  develop  and  introduce  new medical
             applications for hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

          5. To  distinguish  inappropriate,   ineffective   or  fraudulent
             application of  hyperbaric  oxygen therapy and  to  discourage
             their practice.

       Hyperbaric oxygen therapy consists of sitting in a closed chamber in
       which the pressure  is elevated to twice that at sea level (14.7 PSI
       X 2 = 29.4 PSI 'pounds per square  inch'),  and  then breathing pure
       oxygen (while in the chamber).

       The typical course  of treatment is about 90 minutes  two  to  three
       times per week.   This  therapy  is  an  established  therapy for 13
       recognized conditions and experimental in may more.  It is practiced
       in hospitals throughout the United States and the world.

       The Center for  Advancement  of  Hyperbaric   Medicine  can  provide
       treatment on your physicians prescription. This is *NOT A COMMERCIAL
       VENTURE* the application    to   AIDS/HIV   is   experimental    and
       investigatory in nature.
