       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       We here at  KeelyNet  have  noted  several comments relating to some
       form of noxious  energy associated  with  the  production  of  "cold
       current" or "negative electricity."

       The only tangible document we have which speaks directly of this, is
       the original "THETA"  document that was sent to us  from  Washington
       state by one  our  closest  associates.   We  passed  a copy of this
       document to several of our associates  including  Dan Davidson.  Dan
       then spent about  $1000  building  one of the devices,  but  without
       positive results as  to  the generation of free energy as claimed in
       the paper.

       In the original THETA document,  (soon  to  be  on  KeelyNet  in its
       original form), once  the  construction  has  been   completed,  the
       authors (unknown) state  that the device should be placed in a steel
       container and placed away from human habitation.

       There is no mention of the production  of  radioactive  energies, or
       even of any radiaton measurements that might have  been  taken  from
       the device.  The paper does however, estimate the life of the barium
       ferrite transformer material  to  be  approximately 300 years.  This
       leads us to believe that there is  some kind of low level fissioning
       process.

       So in the case of the THETA machine, at this time,  we  do  not know
       whether a cold  current  is  generated  or if it is a process of low
       level radioactive decay.

       Interestingly enough, some radionics  researchers  have  died  under
       mysterious circumstances associated with some as yet unknown noxious
       form of energy.   This  would  indicate that the radionic  "carrier"
       might be somehow  associated with the "cold current" of free energy.
       At the present time, we know of no  one  looking  into this radionic
       correlation beyond possibly  Peter  Kelly  of  Georgia   (listed  in
       CONTACT1 under Inter-Dimensional Sciences).

       In the event  you  are experimenting in the area of scalar fields or
       "cold current" type  free energy  generators,  we  urge  you  to  be
       careful and keep track of any physical discomfort or  other symptoms
       not normal for   you.    If  you  experience  anomalies,  stop  your
       experiments and PLEASE share your  experiences with us or other wide
       audiences.

             A warning from the T.V.Q. group as to the possibility of
                   Scalar / Tesla experimentation health risks.

       There has been quite a lot of talk in the popular press concerning
       the possible health   risks   due  to  exposure  to  electromagnetic
       radiation.

       While these articles  concern  themselves   with   the   unavoidable
       exposure to the electromagnetic fields generated by  domestic  power
       wiring and radio  transmissions,  there  is  reason  to believe that
       experimenters who work  on Tesla coils  and  scalar  electromagnetic
       systems may have an additional cause for concern.

       The following entry was downloaded from the Usenet some time ago:

            **********************************************************

       The May/June issue of "Microwave News" contains very big news.

       According to the lead article, the EPA's long-awaited  report on the
       health risks of electromagnetic fields is about to be released.

       However, Dr. William Farland, director of EPA's Office of Health and
       Environmental Assessment, apparently  decided  a  few  weeks  ago to
       delete the report's two most important recommendations:

              that 60 Hz powerline fields be classified by EPA as "Probable
              Human Carcinogens" (like formaldehyde and creosote), and

              higher frequency radio emissions  and  microwaves  should  be
              classed as "Possible Human Carcinogens" (like saccharine).

       MN says Dr. Farland's justification for deleting these  findings  is
       that the causal  mechanisms are still not understood, especially the
       relationship between dose and response,  even  though circumstantial
       evidence for some degree of cancer risk can no longer be ignored.

       MN editor Louis Slesin also says that Paul Brodeur will have another
       installment of his  "Annals of Radiation" series  in  the  July  8th
       issue of the  New  Yorker.   He  may  comment  on  this  latest  EPA
       controversy.

       Here are the concluding paragraphs  from  the  REVISED  (June  1990)
       draft summary of the EPA staff report, as quoted in MN:

          "In conclusion, the several studies showing leukemia, lymphoma
          and cancer of the nervous system in children exposed to magnetic
          fields from  residential  60  Hz  electrical  power  distribution
          systems, supported  by  similar  findings  in  adults  in several
          occupational studies also involving  electrical  power  frequency
          exposures, show a consistent pattern of response  that  suggests,
          but does not prove, a causal link.

          Frequency components  higher  than  60  Hz cannot be ruled out as
          contributing factors.  Evidence from a large number of biological
          test systems shows that these  fields  induce  biological effects
          that are   consistent   with  several  possible   mechanisms   of
          carcinogenesis.

                                      Page 2





          However, none  of  these processes has been experimentally linked
          to the induction of tumors, either  in animals or humans, by EMFs
          [electromagnetic fields].  The particular aspects  of exposure to
          the EMFs that cause these events are not known.

          "In evaluating  the  potential  for  carcinogenicity  of chemical
          agents, EPA has developed an approach  that attempts to integrate
          all of the available information into a summary classification of
          the overall weight-of-evidence that the agent is  carcinogenic in
          humans.

          At this  time  such a characterization regarding the link between
          cancer and exposure to EMFs is  not appropriate because the basic
          nature of  the interaction between EMFs and biological  processes
          is not  understood.   For example, a real possibility exists that
          exposure to higher field strengths  is  actually  less  hazardous
          than exposure to low field strengths.

          Because of  this  uncertainty,  it  is  inappropriate   to   make
          generalizations about the carcinogenicity of EMFs.  As additional
          studies with   more   definitive   exposure   assessment   become
          completed, a better understanding  of  the  nature  of the hazard
          will be gained.  With our current understanding  we  can identify
          60 Hz  magnetic fields from power lines and perhaps other sources
          in the home as a possible, but  not  proven,  cause  of cancer in
          people.

          The absence  of  key  information  summarized   above   makes  it
          difficult to   make   quantitative   estimates   of  risk.   Such
          quantitative estimates are necessary  before  judgments about the
          degree of safety or hazard of a given exposure can be made.  This
          situation indicates  the  need  to  continue  to   evaluate   the
          information from  ongoing  studies  and  to  further evaluate the
          mechanisms of  carcinogenic action  and  the  characteristics  of
          exposure that lead to these effects."

            **********************************************************

       The uncertainty in linking the electromagnetic field to any possible
       carcinogenicity is understandable     in    light     of     several
       epidemiological studies which   attempt   to   correlate  levels  of
       exposure and incidences of cancers  and  leukemia.   The  results do
       show some correlation,  but  not a simple one.  For  example,  homes
       located next to  high  current  power  transformers do have a higher
       rate of incidence, but not as high  as  the  homes located one house
       further away from the same transformer.

       We must keep in mind that these studies are conducted by collecting
       data from field studies and then performing statistical analysis.
       Such a study may not show the cause for a given effect if there is
       more than one agent at work.

       Although the Aharonov-Bohm effect has been proven  in  the  lab, the
       fact that the  magnetic  field is not a fundamental field is not yet
       accepted or understood by the majority of scientists and engineers.

                                      Page 3





       If the studies of electromagnetic exposure also included data on the
       relative strengths of the A-fields as well as the B-fields there may
       be a much  stronger  case for the possible carcinogenic effects.  To
       the best of our knowledge, no such study has been conducted to date.

       Any such study  would  require the  use  of  a  detector  which  can
       directly measure the intensity of the magnetic vector  potential, or
       A-field.  Such detectors do exist, but current A-field detectors are
       not practical for such studies.

       With a practical, portable A-field detector, it would be possible to
       go back to the original studies and add the relative field intensity
       data.  With this  new  data,  a direct cause and effect relationship
       may emerge.

       In his masterpeice of paranoia " Fer-de-lance  "  T.E. Bearden shows
       on page 128,  slide  33,  a scalar wave detector.   This  device  is
       described as a  Bedini  version of the Dea / Faretto detector.  This
       device employs a permanent magnet with a field strength in excess of
       forty kilogauss.  This  magnet must  then  be  shielded  to  prevent
       external electromagnetic energy  from reaching the  coil  above  the
       magnet.

       Such a detector is not practical, as the mass of a forty kilogauss
       magnet is considerable  at best, and the shielding needed would have
       a still larger  mass.  It would  be  difficult  to  prove  that  the
       shielding was not saturated, and that any signal  detected  was  not
       electromagnetic in origin.   Several  layers  of  shielding would be
       needed to prevent  magnetic  coupling  of  external  electromagnetic
       signals to the  secondary  magnetic fields set up in  the  shielding
       itself.

       The operation of  this  detector  is  based  on  the theory that the
       magnet's field will be modulated  by  an  incident scalar wave or A-
       field. It is not known to members of this group why  the magnet must
       have such a  high  field  strength,  but  we  assume  that  this  is
       necessary to induce  a  signal in  the  coil  strong  enough  to  be
       measured.  The inclusion of a preamplifier into the  detector design
       would seem to support this conclusion.

       Our research group  has  developed  a  detector design which is also
       based upon the magnetic modulation theory, but uses a magnetic field
       which is considerably smaller.  Because  the magnetic field strength
       is much smaller the shielding problems are also reduced,  along with
       the detector's mass.

       This detector design  has  been  proven  to  have exceptionally high
       sensitivity and is also directional.   By  using  an external pickup
       coil in addition  to  the  detector  it  is possible  to  positively
       determine if any given detected signal is of electromagnetic origin.

       Placed in proximity  to  a  pair  of  conductors  carrying household
       current to a load, this detector shows  an  A-field to be present at
       twice the line frequency.  This can be understood  by  referring  to
       page 123, slide 23, of " Fer-de-lance ".

       While not exactly light in weight, this new detector is portable and
       most important, could be constructed by experimenters to measure the
       fields generated by whatever devices the experimenter chooses.  As

                                      Page 4





       experimenters develop and  improve  their  devices,  they  must also
       modify the balance  of electromagnetic  and  scalar  energy  in  the
       device.

       Even a simple Tesla coil, with a single shorted turn,  will  produce
       quite large magnetic  fields  and their associated A-fields.  As the
       device is improved, the potential  health  risks due to these fields
       increase.

       It is our belief that the ratio of electromagnetic field strength to
       A-field strength is involved in determining the biological effect of
       electromagnetic fields, and that this accounts for  the difficulties
       in determining the carcinogenic agent.

       We are currently   investigating   several  ways  to  make  detailed
       construction plans for   these   detectors   available   to   anyone
       interested in using them, either for their own work  or  for studies
       on the effects  of electromagnetic fields on living systems.  Anyone
       interested should post E-mail to Harold Kobrin's account on this
       BBS (KeelyNet 214-324-301).
