                            IS AIDS BIOLOGICAL WARFARE?

                              THE STRECKER MEMORANDUM


       Thank you for requesting this information.   We have a story to tell
       you, a very strange story, one that affects you, me, and every other
       human being on  earth.   A story that must be taken seriously by the
       governments of every nation in the  world  because  there may not be
       many humans left  to govern by the turn of the century,  or  shortly
       thereafter.  A story  so  bizarre,  and so sinister that, if it were
       not for the fact that it is all true, it would make a great science
       fiction thriller. (Interestingly   enough,   Lorimar   Pictures   of
       Hollywood has purchased the rights to Dr. Strecker's life story.)

       The story begins  in 1983 with Dr. Robert B. Strecker,  M.D.,  Ph.D.
       Dr. Strecker practices internal medicine and gastroenterology in Los
       Angeles.  He is  a  trained  pathologist  and  also holds a Ph.D. in
       pharmacology.  Dr. Strecker and his brother, Ted, an attorney, were
       preparing a proposal for a health maintenance organization (HMO) for
       Security Pacific Bank of California.   They needed to know the long-
       term financial effects of insuring and treating AIDS  patients.   In
       as much as  this information was not readily available in 1983, both
       brothers began researching the medical literature to learn what they
       could about this  relatively  new  disease.   The  information  they
       uncovered right from the beginning was so startling to them, so hard
       to believe, that it would dramatically alter both  their  lives  and
       lead them on a five year quest culminating with the creation of "The
       Strecker Memorandum," the most controversial video tape of our time,
       and a remarkable set of documents called "The Bioattack Alert."

       WHAT THEY DISCOVERED

       Right there in  the  medical  literature  for  anyone  to  read  for
       themselves was, basically, proof  that  the  AIDS virus and pandemic
       was actually PREDICTED years ago by a world famous virologist, among
       others.  They found that top scientists writing in the Bulletin of

                                      Page 1





       the World Health  Organization  were  actually  REQUESTING that AIDS
       like viruses be created to study  the  effects  on humans.  In fact,
       the Streckers unearthed  thousands of documents all  supporting  the
       manmade origin of AIDS.

       Meanwhile, the government  was  telling everyone that a green monkey
       in Africa bit  some  native and started  AIDS.   As  their  research
       continued, it became obvious from the documentation  that  the virus
       itself was not only created as requested, but actually DEPLOYED, and
       now threatens the  existence  of mankind because it does what it was
       designed to do:  cause cancer in  humans  via  a  contagious  virus.
       Eventually the Streckers came to realize everything  the government,
       the so-called AIDS experts and media were telling the public was not
       only misleading, but out and out lies.  The truth of the
       matter is:

          AIDS is a manmade disease;
          AIDS is not a homosexual disease;
          AIDS is not a venereal disease;
          AIDS can be carried by mosquitos;
          Condoms will not prevent AIDS;
          There are a least six different AIDS viruses loose in the world;
          There will never be a vaccine cure;
             And on and on, but...

       THE SCARIEST PART

       The most dreaded   fear   that  all  oncologists  (cancer  doctors),
       virologists, and immunologists live with is that some day CANCER, in
       one form or another, will become a  contagious disease, transferable
       from one person to another.  AIDS has now made fear  a  reality.  If
       you think you  are  safe  because you are not gay or promiscuous, or
       because you are  not  sexually active,  then  you  must  watch  "The
       Strecker Memorandum" very carefully.

       IF YOU PLAN TO HAVE SEX TONIGHT YOU HAD BETTER READ THIS

       The most common  misconception  being  foisted  upon  us  right  now
       concerns sexually active  Americans.  We are told that if a man uses
       a condom the  transference  of  the   deadly   virus   is  virtually
       eliminated.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Of  the  body
       fluids that the AIDS virus is found in, semen is the least.

       As a matter  of  fact,  in  every single study ever published on the
       subject, no one has found a significant  amount  in  anyone's semen.
       It just isn't  there in huge numbers.  There is usually  only  about
       one virus per  milliliter,  a  statistically irrelevant amount.  One
       copious ejaculation might produce  only one or two viruses.  This is
       substantiated in the medical literature.

       But, just for argument's sake, let's say all the medical studies are
       wrong.  Let's pretend  that  there  are countless millions  of  AIDS
       viruses in the ejaculation.  Are you aware that condoms are riddled
       with microscopic or  larger  holes?   Studies  show  that  even  the
       smallest holes found in condoms are two to ten times larger than the
       AIDS virus.  It's like shooting a  golf  ball  through  a basketball
       hoop.  Condoms have not, will not, and cannot prevent AIDS.



                                      Page 2





       THOUSANDS ALREADY DEAD

       Fifty thousand Americans  have already died because they didn't know
       the truth about AIDS.  Between twelve  and fifteen million Americans
       have already been infected.  One in 60 babies born  in New York City
       is infected; one in 300 college students in America is infected; one
       in 20 aliens  applying for amnesty is infected, including men, women
       and children.  These are just some  of  the facts you are not likely
       to hear about from the media.

       WHY A VIDEO TAPE?

       One of the first things the Streckers did was to try  and tell their
       medical and legal   colleagues   what   they  were  finding  in  the
       literature.  Some were interested;  most were not.  Certainly no one
       was prepared to  risk their professional standing  by  making  waves
       within the establishment.   Ted  Strecker  compiled some of the most
       damaging documents into a report he called "The Bioalert Attack" and
       sent it to every Governor of every  state,  the President, the VICE-
       PRESIDENT (now President), the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, and selected
       members of Congress.   He  got a grand total of three  replies  from
       three governors; nothing  from  the  government.   Both  he  and Dr.
       Strecker were laughed  at  and  ridiculed  at  every  turn.   As  an
       example, Dr.  Strecker told the government in 1985 that virtually
       every person testing  positive  for AIDS would die  prematurely  and
       painfully.  The government  said  that  was nonsense.  Their figures
       showed that maybe ten percent at  most  would  die from the disease.
       In 1986, the  government  said  maybe 50 percent of  those  infected
       would die, in  1987 they said maybe 75 percent, in 1988 they finally
       agreed with Dr. Strecker that AIDS  is  virtually 100 percent fatal.
       We could go on with facts Dr. Strecker unearthed that  the "experts"
       said were wrong and now accepted as the truth.  Dr. Strecker, like a
       good scientist, submitted paper after paper with his findings to all
       the prestigious medical journals in America.  They were refused.  He
       then tried having  his  findings published in Europe.  Again, closed
       doors.  What to do?  Dr. Strecker  did  not  feel  he could take the
       time from his practice and his research to write  a  book.   On  the
       other hand, everyone  has  a TV and now most households have a video
       cassette recorder (VCR).  The time  involved  to  make  a  video  is
       nothing compared to writing a book, and so the video "The Strecker
       Memorandum" was created.   It is 96 minutes of the  most  startling,
       controversial, and information  packed  video you will ever see.  It
       disputes virtually everything the  American  public is being told by
       the government, the so-called AIDS experts and the media.  In fact,
       after seeing it YOU will know more about AIDS than 99 percent of all
       doctors in America.

       MUSIC IS NOTHING IF THE AUDIENCE IS DEAF

       With the video made, it seemed a simple matter to advertise  it  and
       the world would  now  become  aware  of  what  it was facing, right?
       WRONG!  The fact  that  you are even  reading  about  "The  Strecker
       Memorandum" now is  a  minor miracle by itself, in  as  much  as  TV
       stations have refused  to  advertise  it.  TV and radio time brokers
       that sell blocks of commercial time  have  refused  to sell us time.
       TV station managers  have  refused  to even air programs  containing
       interviews with Dr.  Strecker.   A  national  radio  network  did an
       interview with a famous talk show  host  and  Dr.  Strecker and then
       refused to run it.  Virtually every big name network television

                                      Page 3





       magazine show and  all  the syndicated TV interviewers and talk show
       hosts have said NO to Dr. Strecker.  Big  city  newspapers  will not
       take any print ads telling about it, and so it goes...WHY?   What is
       in "The Strecker  Memorandum" that sends a cold chill down the spine
       of most media executives?

       WHY IS EVERYONE AFRAID OF "THE STRECKER MEMORANDUM"?

       The excuse that  we  hear  over   and   over   is  that  it  is  too
       controversial.  TOO CONTROVERSIAL?  They say that this  information,
       if widely disseminated,  will cause the public to panic.  If someone
       had poisoned your water supply and you and your family could die,
       wouldn't you want to know about it?   Would you panic?  Or would you
       more likely be outraged and try to find out who did  it  and  punish
       them?  We feel the only persons who might panic are those scientists
       who willingly or  otherwise  created  AIDS  and  are  now  promoting
       misinformation by covering it up.  After all, if you made AIDS would
       you tell anyone about it?

       THINK OF YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS...NOW THINK OF THEM DEAD

       The number of AIDS infected people  is  doubling approximately every
       12 months, and  in some areas even sooner.  With twelve  to  fifteen
       million Americans carrying the virus, you don't have to be a rocket
       scientist to see  how  long  we  have  here in the U.S.  Africa has,
       conservatively, 75 million infected; some estimates double that.

       Brazil as a country is in serious  jeopardy  because all through the
       1970's they were buying their blood supply from Africa.  On top of
       that, the World  Health Organization conducted a large  scale  small
       pox vaccination program   there   in   the   1970's  (for  the  full
       implications of that see "The Strecker Memorandum").  Southern Japan
       has about 30 percent infected with  HTLV  I,  the  leukemia  causing
       virus (although you will never hear about that on  TV).   Russia  is
       now reporting AIDS  as  a  problem  and  no  one  can  enter  Russia
       permanently without a current negative  blood  test  for AIDS.  Cuba
       has already set  up concentration camps for AIDS infected  and  they
       are full (you  won't  see  that  on  TV either).  Haiti of course is
       ravaged by AIDS; more than 15 percent  of  the  people  infected and
       getting worse every day.  And so it goes.

       Virtually every nation on earth with few exceptions (Iran is one) is
       reporting a growing   problem.   It's  on  every  continent,   every
       subcontinent, and every  island chain, Atlantic and Pacific.  So why
       won't the media or government tell you these things?  Is it too
       controversial for you to handle?  Are you going to panic?

       IS THERE ANY HOPE?

       Yes and no.  NO, if you are waiting  for  the government to create a
       magic bullet.  As you will see in "The Strecker Memorandum," part of
       the problem is that all the various AIDS viruses are "recombinant
       retroviruses."  Very simply,  that means they have  the  ability  to
       recombine with the genes of any cell they enter and the offspring or
       new viruses they  form  are different from the parent viruses.  HTLV
       III alone (that's the most common American AIDS virus) has the
       mathematical ability to change itself  9,000  x 9,000 x 9,000 x 9000
       times (which is  9,000  to  the  fourth  power).   The  common  cold
       recombines much less frequently and we haven't found a cure for it

                                      Page 4





       after a hundred  years.  Besides, does it make much sense to entrust
       the cure for AIDS to the same people that may have created it?  YES,
       there is hope if Dr. Strecker and  a  growing  number  of  realistic
       scientists are correct in looking at alternative, nonallopathic, non
       drug modalities based   on  Raman  spectroscopy.    In   fact   many
       experiments are going on now that offer great promise.

       Unfortunately, our government  takes  a  dim  view  of  any  type of
       treatment for any type of disease  let  alone  AIDS  that  does  not
       conform to its   rigid  rules  for  acceptance,  registration,   and
       legalization.  Of course  the  FDA  would  definitely like to see an
       allopathic drug treatment  or cure  presented  by  an  ethical  drug
       company or university.  Well, we don't think that's going to happen.

       Because of this attitude, much experimentation in America must go
       underground, underfunded, or  out  of the country entirely.   Again,
       this is explained further in "The Strecker Memorandum."

       BE BOLD AND  MIGHTY  FORCES  WILL  COME TO YOUR AID OR MIGHTY FORCES
       WILL COME AND KILL YOU

       An ominous personal aspect of this  story  has  been  the sudden and
       unexpected deaths of  two of the key players.  First,  Dr.Strecker's
       brother, Ted Strecker,  was  found  shot  to  death  in  his home in
       Springfield, Missouri, an apparent  suicide, on August 11,1988.  Was
       Ted Strecker suicidal?  Perhaps.  In the past he suffered from
       depression and monumental  frustration  at  the  relative   lack  of
       interest in his  findings.   Dr.  Strecker  spoke with him the night
       before his death.  Ted was cheerful,  in  good  spirits, and looking
       forward to certain  new  developments that promised  progress.   The
       next day he was found dead, his 22 caliber rifle next to him.  No
       note, no message,  no  goodbyes  to  anyone.  Very untypical of him.
       Officially a suicide.  Next.  Illinois  State Representative Douglas
       Huff of Chicago was found alone in his home, dead from an apparent
       overdose of cocaine and heroin, on September 22, 1988.

       Representative Huff did everything in his power to make the Illinois
       State Legislature and the people of Chicago aware of  Dr. Strecker's
       work.  He was very vocal, gave many press interviews, was constantly
       on television and  radio  urging  people  to wake up to the cover-up
       concerning AIDS.  Did Representative  Huff  use drugs?  Perhaps yes,
       but only occasionally and recreationally.  Was he  an  addict?   No.
       Would he have known how dangerous a massive overdose off cocaine and
       heroin was?  Yes,  of  course.  Cause of death: officially a stroke.
       Dr. Strecker has serious doubts that  his  brother  killed  himself.
       Representative Huff's associates doubt he died accidentally, and yet
       they are gone.  Who's next?

       IGNORANCE IS BLISS, OR IS IT SUICIDE?

       We all know it is easier for a king to have a lie  believed  than  a
       beggar to spread  the truth.  Well, we are spreading the truth about
       AIDS.  Unfortunately, it isn't pretty.   But the fact is you are not
       being told the  truth  by  the  government  or  the  so-called  AIDS
       experts.  The media,  for  reasons  of  their  own, will not present
       information contradicting the official propaganda. So you can choose
       to go along with the same people  who  gave  us  brain  cancer (SV40
       virus) as a result of their contaminated polio vaccines in the
       early 1960's; a polio like disease from their contaminated Swine Flu

                                      Page 5





       vaccine in the  1970's; and AIDS from their smallpox and hepatitis B
       vaccines; or, you can at least make yourself aware of the clear and
       present dangers that  we  all  face   by   watching   "The  Strecker
       Memorandum."  The cost of the tape is nominal, but  we  submit  that
       remaining ignorant can cost infinitely more.
