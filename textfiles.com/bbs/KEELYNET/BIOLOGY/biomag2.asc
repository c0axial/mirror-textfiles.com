           The following  is  a  very  basic introduction to the incredible
       researches of Albert Roy Davis and Walter Rawls.  Davis is no longer
         living, but Rawls currently lives in Florida around Jacksonville.

       We highly recommend the purchase  of  the  following books detailing
       the researches of these two brilliant investigators.

       Magnetism and its Effects on the Living System
           Explains for the first time how magnetism affects  your life and
           the life  of all living systems around you.  The result of years
           of investigation into the laws  of  magnetism,  it  explains the
           discovery that a magnet has not one effect on the  living system
           but TWO  EFFECTS,  each  supplied  by  the  two  forms of energy
           transmitted from each pole.  You  or  any other qualified person
           can reproduce the projects in this book.  (Illustrated)

       The Magnetic Effect
           In this  book,  Davis and Rawls present and discuss  biomagnetic
           experiments and  research that have been successfully duplicated
           by members of the orthodox scientific  community.   The  authors
           reveal the   factual,  natural  basis  of  applied   biomagnetic
           energies and  add  greatly  to the understanding of this new and
           exciting field.  The computer-exact and reproducible findings in
           this work  apply  to  the  treatment   of   such  conditions  as
           arthritis, cancer, glaucoma, sexual problems, and aging.

       The Magnetic Blueprint of Life
           Written with forcefulness and precision, this is a comprehensive
           guide to the effect of magnetism upon the air  we  breathe,  the
           food we  eat,  the  exercise we take.  It is an eloquent plea to
           the scientific community to reconsider the significance of basic
           magnetism...."the most important energy in Nature."

                    with information from "The Magnetic Effect"
                      by Albert Roy Davis and Walter C. Rawls

       One of the most important series  of  experiments  ever done and yet
       still not widely known, were those carried out by Albert  Roy  Davis
       in conjunction with Walter Rawls.  These experiments are FUNDAMENTAL

                                      Page 1

       to an understanding of magnetic forces and are to this day not being
       used widely because many have never heard of them.

       They found that  each pole of a magnet has SPECIFIC effects that are
       quite different from those of a full  magnet  where  both  poles are
       applied simultaneously.  These polar effects are deemed "mono-polar"
       for one pole.   The  poles  spin  in  opposite directions  and  have
       opposite properties.

       Specifically, North Pole   energies   cause  mass  to  contract  and
       condense, rotating in a CCW direction,  while  South  Pole  energies
       cause mass to  expand  and dissipate, rotating in  a  CW  direction.
       Also, North Pole  energies have alkaline properties while South Pole
       energy is acid.  North pole energies  tend  to  collect fluids while
       South Pole energies dissipate fluids.  North pole energy is referred
       to as negative  because  it  reduces or attracts, while  South  pole
       energy is referred to as positive because it expands and dissipates.

       Since magnetic monopole  magnets  are not available at just any Wal-
       Mart store, they chose to use the  longest  possible bar or cylinder
       magnets they could  acquire  which  would  allow  for  the  greatest
       separation of the two opposite energies.

       It was found  that  use  of  a North Pole would provide an energetic
       environment which would cause cancer  cells to contract and die out.
       This energetic environment  also has other healthy  applications  as
       detailed in their many books.

       I had the  pleasure  of  visiting with Walter Rawls one afternoon at
       his office in  Jacksonville,  Florida   several   years   back.   We
       discussed many things including Keely, of which he  had never heard.

       Should you wish  to  carry  out your own experiments with magnets as
       blazed by these pioneers, here are some helpful tips.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       CORRECT POLE IDENTIFICATION

       First, you need to understand how to correctly identify the polarity
       of any magnet.  In Davis/Rawls own words:

         "The North pole of a magnet seeks  a South pole; likewise, a South
          pole seeks a North pole.  The North pole of a magnet  is  NOT the
          North-SEEKING pole, nor is the South pole the South-SEEKING pole.

          In fact, the North-SEEKING pole of a magnet is ACTUALLY the South
          pole!  The South-SEEKING pole of a magnet is the North pole.  The
          rule to remember is OPPOSITES ATTRACT and SIMILARS REPEL.

          Test a magnet for correct usage by identifying the separate poles
          correctly.  Using  a  bar or cylinder magnet, tie a thread around
          the exact center of the magnet,  with  the  thread having a loose
          end.

                                      Page 2

          Tie the  loose  end of the thread to any stationary overhang that
          allows the magnet to turn without  hindrance  in space.  When the
          magnet stops  turning,  the  end  of the magnet pointing  in  the
          direction of  the  earth's  North  pole  is the South pole of the
          magnet.  You may need a simple  compass  to determine the earth's
          North pole direction.

          After you have determined the South pole of the magnet, mark that
          pole end with red fingernail polish or paint.  Once  you have one
          magnet properly  identified for North and South poles this magnet
          can be  used to IDENTIFY the  North  and  South  poles  of  OTHER
          magnets.  (They  use the color RED to indicate  danger  and  thus
          avoid it for biological experiments.  The reason being that since
          it causes  a  swelling of tissue, the fluids flow more freely, it
          accelerates life and growth.  If  you have a bacteria or disease,
          it will  also  ACCELERATE  its  growth  and  so   can   be  quite
          dangerous.)

          For example,  if  we  bring  the  South  pole of any magnet up to
          another magnet's pole, a REPELLING  force  shows that the pole of
          the unknown magnet is the South pole.  An ATTRACTING  force shows
          that the unknown pole is the North pole.

          You may  wish  to purchase a small inexpensive magnetometer.  The
          sensitive needle of this instrument moves in one direction or the
          other depending on the separate  magnetic pole in close vicinity.
          The law of magnetism is a PRIMARY law of nature:
                    Like forces REPEL - unlike forces ATTRACT.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       ESTIMATING FIELD STRENGTH

       Magnetic field strength  is measured in units called  gauss.   Since
       magnets are not sold with this value printed on them and gaussmeters
       are expensive, you  need  a  way  to determine the approximate field
       strength.

       Magnets are generally  sold by their  LIFTING  power.   That  is,  a
       horseshoe magnet is offered as having a lifting power,  when  placed
       against a piece  of  heavy  metal,  of  2  pounds to 25 pounds to 50
       pounds, depending on the size, type, or kind of magnet.

       As a guide to the approximate gauss  of commercial magnets, consider
       the following:

          A magnet having a lifting power of 2 pounds may  vary from 500 to
          600 gauss units;
          a lifting power of 5 pounds may vary from 900 to 1200 gauss;
          a lifting power of 25 pounds is usually around 2000 gauss;
          with 50 pounds lifting power, 3500 to 4500 gauss.

       For more precise   measurement,   an   equipment   aid,  such  as  a
       magnetometer, should be employed.

       Care must be taken to properly determine  which  pole  is  North and
       which is South, based on the above criteria.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       When I was visiting with Walter in Florida, he very  kindly  gave me
       an assortment of  magnets  and books as well as an interesting meter
       that is used to measure the field strength AND POLARITY of a magnet.

                                      Page 3

       This meter allows  you to quickly and accurately determine what pole
       is North or  South.   It  also  has   instructions  for  helping  to
       determine the field  strength.  The meter sells for  $50  and  is  a
       quick way to VISUALLY determine the polarity of any magnet.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       CARE AND HANDLING OF MAGNETS

       To prevent breakage  and  loss  of  magnetic power, you should never
       drop or strike the magnet with a sharp  blow.   Not only can it chip
       but it can also lose magnetic energy.

       Magnets should never be stored in a hot location.  Most magnets lose
       ALL their power at temperatures from 400 to 500 degrees  Fahrenheit.
       The loss occurs  at  the CURIE point, where the magnetic domains are
       no longer aligned and become chaotic.

       After using a magnet, you should  place  both  ends  of  the  magnet
       against a structure of flat metal.  This will allow  the  magnet  to
       maintain its original  strength.   Such  a  structure  is  called  a
       "keeper."  Magnets should be kept  away  from each other.  If placed
       where the poles  of  separate  magnets  repel,  there   could  be  a
       "bleeding-off" of the energy.  A loss of energy in this manner would
       be rapid.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       WHY YOU SHOULD NOT USE ELECTROMAGNETS

       Very effective and  powerful  magnets are made by passing electrical
       energy through a coil of wire having  a  metal, iron, or steel core.
       However, there is  a  difference between the magnetism  produced  in
       this manner and  the  magnetism  from  a  solid  state  bar or metal
       composition magnet.

       Magnetism HAS A  FREQUENCY.   It  also  has  motion.   The  rate  of
       vibration depends on  the  size,  length, width, and  power  of  the
       magnet.  Solid state  composition  magnets,  such as metal, iron and
       steel, are CONSTANT in their rate  of  vibration  DEPENDING on their
       structure.  An electromagnet,  however,  may  present  a  number  of
       different types of vibrations.

       Any kind of  electromagnet  has  many turns of insulated wire.  Each
       turn of this wire presents so many lines of magnetism.  Actually, we
       have discovered that these lines  of  force  are  really  CABLES  of
       force, as explained  in our earlier publications.   (See  RAWLS1.ASC
       and RAWLS1.GIF on KeelyNet)

       However, a coil  wound  a  certain  number  of turns has a different
       frequency from a fixed metal or composition  magnet.   As  the  coil
       heats, the resistance  to  the flow of current INCREASES.   Here  we
       have a SLOW DROP in magnetic lines, or cables, of force to a RISE IN
       FORCE, depending upon   the   wire   and  core  materials  used  for
       construction.  Therefore, the    vibrations    supplied    by    the
       electromagnet are NOT  AS  CONSTANT  as  those  from  the  metal  or
       composition magnet.

       Our research has  revealed that size, width, and overall length of a
       magnet GOVERNS FREQUENCY in electrical electron vibrations.  This is
       a discovery not known by the general  scientific  community, because
       wee have not  published  our scientific materials on  this  research
       finding.  We are  working  on this discovery in the establishment of
       provable laws that  we  will  disclose   when  completed.   We  feel
       confident this future disclosure will open new avenues  that neither
       we nor the general scientific community could properly comprehend at
       this time.   (printed in The Magnetic Effect in 1975)
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       I asked Walter  about  this  frequency  business with magnets and at
       that time, he would not disclose how  the  measurements were made as
       it was proprietary  to  their  company, BioMagnetics  International.
       There are over  36  international  patents  based on the Davis/Rawls
       discoveries.

       Also at the time I spoke with Walter,  he  said they had developed a
       couch that could DIAGNOSE problem areas in the body with an accuracy
       of 99%.  It  uses  magnets  to  create a response  in  the  body  to
       indicate an infected   or   diseased  location.   This  response  is
       described in the books listed above and has to do with a contraction
       of tissue when in the presence of a North pole energy.

       It is interesting that the Floyd (Sparky)  Sweet  Vacuum Triode uses
       magnets that are "tuned" to the 60 cps frequency.   This  allows the
       device to pull  in  space  energy  at  a  frequency that requires no
       alteration to run off the shelf devices.   We also understand he has
       "pulled" as much  as  3000 watts of free energy directly  from  this
       space energy source,  also  called  the ZPE or hyperspace or virtual
       flux.  The magnets are put under a tremendous stress by placing like
       poles against one  another,  then   binding   them   together,  this
       effectively creates a giant magnet with spatial stress  bubble.  All
       that is listed on KeelyNet as SWEET1 through SWEET4 and the diagrams
       are listed as VTAPAK.ZIP.

       The device also  appears  to  be  LOCALE  DEPENDENT, meaning that it
       works better in some areas than others.   To  our  knowledge, no one
       has yet publicly  admitted  to  successfully duplicating  the  Sweet
       device.

       We are told  Sweet  is  under  a  Secrecy Order by the United States
       government that forbids his discussing  or  working further with his
       own discovery.  If he'd only "slip" a copy of the plans out, we'd be
       very happy to distribute them across the computer  networks  and  to
       many other researchers who would make it a reality for all.
