    This is an article sent to Vangard Sciences by Ms. Hetty Quarrella
    from Michigan.   Hetty  has  worked closely with Hannah Kroger and
    has been researching the hazards  associated  with the consumption
    of irradiated food.

    Most foodstores sell foods that have been through  the irradiation
    process.   Manufacturers and  suppliers  are  required  by  law to
    indicate on the  label  if  a  food  has  been  treated  with  the
    irradiation process.

                  FOOD IRRADIATION: What are the hazards?

         It has  been  known for decades that gamma radiation  can  be
    used to preserve  foods.   Studies of the effectiveness and safety
    of food irradiation  are  far from  new.   Some  of  the  problems
    observed with food irradiation include the following.

         There is  evidence  suggesting that genetic and  reproductive
    irregularities may be   associated   with   the   consumption   of
    irradiated food.   In one study,  children  and animals fed newly-
    irradiated wheat showed  a  cell abnormality called  "polyploidy,"
    where cells contain  more than their normal set of chromosomes. In
    another, rodents fed irradiated  onions  have  ovaries  or  testes
    which differed significantly  in  weight  from  those  of  control
    animals.

         A March,  1984  report  prepared  for  the U.S. Department of
    Agriculture on 12 studies using irradiated chicken meat concluded,

            "Two of the studies... had  some possible adverse findings
             which will  require  careful  consideration   before  the
             process can be declared safe."

         Mice fed  irradiated  chicken in one study showed an increase
    in testicular tumors, lesions including  cancer,  kidney  disease,
    and reduced  life  spans.   Another  study found a radiation-dose-
    related increase in deaths among offspring of flies fed irradiated
    chicken.

         Aflatoxins, potent   cancer-causing   chemicals   created  by
    funguses occurring naturally in  some  foods,  were  produced more
    abundantly than normal on irradiated foods in several studies. The
    exact reasons and   overall   health  effects  are   unknown   but
    aflatoxins are 1,000 times more potent carcinogens than the banned
    pesticide EDB, for which irradiation is a possible substitute.

         Vitamins A,  C,  E,  and especially B may be destroyed by the
    process; amino acids and fats in  foods may also be altered.   The
    effect of irradiation on food nutrients is probably  comparable to
    that of heat sterilization processes, but if widespread use of


                                  Page 1




    irradiation is allowed, many foods may be subject to more than one
    preservative process before they reach the consumer (fruit may be


    irradiated to keep  it  from  spoiling  before  being  canned, for
    example). This could mean a decline  in the nutritional quality of
    our food supply overall.

         Bacteria and  viruses  can develop resistance  to  radiation,
    just as insects  do  to  pesticides.    So  the  effectiveness  of
    irradiation as a preservative over  the  long  term  is not known.
    Radiation can also cause dangerous mutations and  the  development
    of new strains of pest organisms.

         Irradiation does not protect food from contamination that may
    occur after the treatment, unless it is tightly sealed at the time
    of irradiation. For fruits and vegetables, other long-term methods
    of preservation, such as canning, freezing, or refrigeration, will
    probably still be needed.

         Fruit treated  with  radiation  may  become brown or mushy or
    ripen abnormally.  Irradiated citrus fruits will bruise easily and
    black spots may appear on the peel.  Meats must be irradiated in a
    vacuum, since irradiation  in  the   presence   of  oxygen  causes
    rancidity in fat-containing foods.   Clear glass  turns brown when
    irradiated; food irradiated   in  sealed  plastic  containers  may
    develop a bitter, metallic after-taste.

         Chemicals called "radiolytic  products" are produced in foods
    by the radiation process.   These include formaldehyde,  peroxide,
    and others.   The  U.S.  Food  and  Drug Administration, in a 1980
    report, stated that foods irradiated  at  levels  greater than 100
    kilorads

            "may contain  enough  (radiolytic  products)   to  warrant
             toxicological evaluation."

    Levels of radiation that high and higher are necessary to preserve
    many foods."

                      HOW DOES FOOD IRRADIATION WORK?

         In food  irradiation  facilities,  streams of gamma radiation
    from radioactive cobalt-60 (half-life:  5.3  years)  or cesium-137
    (half-life: 30.2 years)  are  directed  through the  foods.    The
    fruits, vegetables, grains  or  meats  do  NOT  become radioactive
    themselves, but some of their cells are altered by the radiation.

         DNA, the "blueprint" for cell  division which is contained in
    all living cells, is damaged by the gamma rays.   The more complex
    the organism, the   larger   and   more   radiation-sensitive  its
    molecules of DNA, and thus the less radiation required to keep its
    cells from dividing.    Small doses  (100  kilorads)  can  prevent
    onions and potatoes from sprouting and sterilize  or kill insects;
    larger dosed (1,000   kilorads  or  more)  are  required  to  kill
    bacteria and viruses.

                             PLAYING WITH FIRE

         Microorganisms can develop resistance to radiation over time

                                  Page 2




    - and some are naturally more resistant than others.  For example,
    irradiating chicken to  kill  salmonella bacteria may not harm the
    hardier bacteria which causes botulism, so that it is free to grow
    uncontested.   But the other microorganisms  which gradually would
    cause the meat  to  smell  or look spoiled may be  killed  by  the
    irradiation process.    Fish  or  chicken meat that is dangerously
    contaminated with botulism could thus appear to be harmless.
