       Lyme disease is    a    tick-transmitted     inflammatory    disorder
       characterized by  an  early  focal  skin lesion, and  subsequently  a
       growing red area on the skin (erythema chronicum migrans or ECM).

       The disorder may  be  followed  weeks later by neurological, heart or
       joint abnormalities.


       Symptomatology
       --------------------------------

       The first symptom  of  Lyme disease  is  a  skin  lesion.   Known  as
       erythema chronicum migrans,  or ECM, this usually  begins  as  a  red
       discoloration (macule) or as an elevated round spot (papule).

       The skin lesion  usually  appears  on  an  extremity or on the trunk,
       especially the thigh, buttock or the  under  arm.  This spot expands,
       often with central clearing, to a diameter as large  as  50 cm (c. 12
       in.).

       Approximately 25% of patients with Lyme disease  report having
       been bitten at that site by a tiny tick 3 to 32 days before  onset of
       ECM.

       The lesion may  be  warm  to  touch. Soon after onset nearly half the
       patients develop multiple smaller  lesions  without hardened centers.
       ECM  generally lasts for a few weeks.

       Other types of  lesions  may subsequently  appear during  resolution.
       Former skin lesions may reappear faintly, sometimes before recurrent

                                       Page 1





       attacks of arthritis.   Lesions of the mucous  membranes do not occur
       in Lyme disease.

       The most common symptoms accompanying  ECM,  or preceding it by a few
       days,  may include  malaise,  fatigue,  chills, fever,  headache  and
       stiff neck.  Less   commonly,   backache,  muscle  aches  (myalgias),
       nausea, vomiting, sore throat, swollen  lymph glands, and an enlarged
       spleen may also be present.

       Most symptoms are characteristically intermittent and  changing,  but
       malaise and fatigue may linger for weeks.

       Arthritis is present   in  about  half  of  the  patients  with  ECM,
       occurring within weeks to months following  onset and lasting as long
       as 2 years.

       Early in the   illness,  migratory  inflammation   of   many   joints
       (polyarthritis) without joint  swelling  may  occur.   Later,  longer
       attacks of swelling and pain in several  large joints, especially the
       knees, typically recur for several years.

       The knees commonly are much more swollen than painful; they are often
       hot, but rarely red.  Baker's cysts (a cyst in the knee) may form and
       rupture.

       Those symptoms accompanying ECM, especially malaise, fatigue and low-
       grade fever, may  also  precede  or  accompany recurrent  attacks  of
       arthritis.  About 10%  of  patients  develop chronic knee involvement
       (i.e. unremittent for 6 months or longer).

       Neurological abnormalities may develop  in about 15% of patients with
       Lyme disease within  weeks to months following onset  of  ECM,  often
       before arthritis occurs.    These  abnormalities  commonly  last  for
       months, and usually resolve completely.  They include:

            1. lymphocytic meningitis or meningoencephalitis
            2. jerky involuntary movements (chorea)
            3. failure of muscle coordination  due  to  dysfunction  of  the
               cerebellum (cerebellar ataxia)
            4. cranial  neuritis including Bell's palsy (a  form  of  facial
               paralysis)
            5. motor  and  sensory  radiculo-neuritis  (symmetric  weakness,
               pain, strange  sensations   in   the   extremities,   usually
               occurring first in the legs)
            6. injury to single nerves causing diminished nerve response
               (mononeuritis multiplex)
            7. inflammation of the spinal cord (myelitis).

       Abnormalities in the heart muscle (myocardium) occur in approximately
       8%  of patients with Lyme disease within weeks of ECM.

       They may include fluctuating degrees of atrioventricular  block  and,
       less commonly, inflammation  of  the  heart  sack  and  heart  muscle
       (myopericarditis) with reduced blood  volume  ejected  from  the left
       ventricle and an enlarged heart  (cardiomegaly).

       When Lyme Disease is contracted during pregnancy, the  fetus  may  or
       may not be adversely affected, or may contract congenital Lyme

       Disease.  In a  study  of  nineteen pregnant women with Lyme Disease,
       fourteen had normal pregnancies and normal babies.

       If Lyme Disease  is  contracted  during   pregnancy,  possible  fetal
       abnormalities and premature birth can occur.


       Etiology
       --------------------------------

       Lyme disease is   caused   by   a   spirochete  bacterium   (Borrelia
       Burgdorferi) transmitted by a small tick called Ixodes dammini.

       The spirochete is   probably  injected  into  the  victim's  skin  or
       bloodstream at the  time of the insect  bite.   After  an  incubation
       period of 3 to 32 days, the organism  migrates outward  in  the skin,
       is spread through  the  lymphatic  system  or is  disseminated by the
       blood to different body organs or other skin sites.

       Lyme Disease was  first  described   in   1909  in  European  medical
       journals.  The first outbreak in the United States  occurred  in  the
       early 1970's in Old lyme, Connecticut.

       An unusually high  incidence  of  juvenile  arthritis in the area led
       scientists to investigate and identify  the  disorder.   In 1981, Dr.
       Willy Burgdorfer identified   the   bacterial   spirochete   organism
       (Borrelia Burgdorferi) which causes this disorder.


       Affected Population
       --------------------------------

       Lyme Disease occurs in wooded areas with populations of mice and deer
       which carry ticks,  and  can  be  contracted during any season of the
       year.


       Related Disorders
       --------------------------------

       Rheumatoid Arthritis is a disorder  similar  in  appearance  to  Lyme
       disease.  However, the pain in rheumatoid arthritis  is  usually more
       pronounced.

       Morning stiffness and symmetric joint swelling more commonly occur in
       rheumatoid arthritis, and  knotty lumps under the skin may be present
       over  bony prominences.  Bony decalcification  which can be prominent
       in Rheumatoid Arthritis is detected on X-rays.

       Brachial Neuritis, also  known as Parsonnage-Turner  Syndrome,  is  a
       common inflammation of  a  group  of  nerves  that  supply  the  arm,
       forearm, and hand (brachial plexus).   It  is characterized by severe
       neck pain in the area above the collarbone (supraclavicular) that may
       radiate down the arm and into the hand.

       There also may  be  weakness  and  numbness  (hyperesthesia)  of  the
       fingers and hands.  Although  many cases have no apparent cause, this
       syndrome may occur following an immunization  (tetanus or diptheria),
       surgery, or infection with Lyme Disease.

                                       Page 3





       Therapies:  Standard
       --------------------------------

       For adults with  Lyme disease the antibiotic tetracycline is the drug
       of choice.  Penicillin V and erythromycin  have  also  been  used. In
       children penicillin V is recommended rather than tetracycline.

       Penicillin V is  now recommended for neurological abnormalities.   It
       is not yet  clear  whether   antibiotic treatment is helpful later in
       the illness when arthritis is the most predominant symptom.

       Treatment should be started as soon  as the rash appears, even before
       the Enzyme Linked Immunoabsorbent Assay (ELISA) test  is   completed.
       Results of this   test   may  be  inaccurate  if  patients  have  had
       antibiotics soon after contracting Lyme Disease, or in those who have
       a weakened immune systems.

       If lyme Disease is contracted during pregnancy, careful monitoring by
       physicians is highly   recommended    to    avoid    possible   fetal
       abnormalities and/or complications.

       For tense knee  joints due to increased fluid flowing  in  the  joint
       spaces (effusions), the use of crutches is often helpful.  Aspiration
       of fluid and injection of a corticosteroid may be beneficial.

       If the patient  with  Lyme  disease has marked functional limitation,
       excision of the  membrane  lining  the  joint  (synovectomy)  may  be
       performed for chronic  (6  months  or  more  despite   therapy)  knee
       effusions, but spontaneous remission can occur after more than a year
       of continuous knee involvement.

       When Lyme Disease  is  contracted  during  pregnancy,  treatment with
       penicillin should begin immediately to avoid the possibility of fetal
       abnormalities.

       In 1989 a new Lyme Disease antibody test, manufactured by Cambridge
       Biosciences Corp., was approved by  the FDA.  This test is being used
       by local laboratories  throughout  the  nation,  making   tests  more
       available to the general population.

       However, it is  97%  specific  for  antibodies  to  Lyme disease when
       compared to Western blot tests,  but  it  cannot  identify  the  live
       bacteria in patients who have not yet developed the antibodies.


       Therapies:  Investigational
       --------------------------------

       Researchers are trying to develop a test that will identify  the Lyme
       disease bacteria in   patients   who   have  not  yet  developed  the
       antibodies.  This would enable doctors  to diagnose Lyme disease very
       early in the course of the illness.

       This disease entry  is  based  upon  medical  information   available
       through July 1989.   Since  NORD's  resources  are limited, it is not
       possible to keep every entry in the  Rare Disease Database completely
       current and accurate.  Please check with the agencies  listed  in the
       Resources section for   the   most  current  information  about  this
       disorder.
