                   put out by Vangard Sciences a long time back.

                            Induced Theta Consciousness
                                 from the works of
                          T. B. Pawlicki and Itzhak Bentov

       Doctor Barbara Brown,  a  pioneer of brain wave research, found that
       sensations of oceanic ecstasy, creative  insight,  PSI  experiences,
       and a thrill of spiritual power combined with preternatural  clarity
       of mind occurred  with  significant  frequency  when  her  subject's
       nervous systems were generating  strong  electrical  pulses  of  7.5
       cycles per second.

       This pattern of  brain  waves  is associated with a  state  of  mind
       called THETA CONSCIOUSNESS.   Brown  also  discovered  that athletes
       generate powerful electrical pulses at the frequency of 7.5 CPS when
       they are performing with superb efficiency.

       Since we have deduced that the athletic  brain  is tuned to generate
       electric pulses by  the  resonant  frequency  of the  body  swinging
       freely in the  gravitational  field,  the  7.5  CPS  wave must be AN
       OVERTONE of the resonance UNITING THE MASS OF THE BODY WITH THE MASS
       OF THE EARTH.  Theta consciousness, therefore, is a state of ORGANIC
       ENERGY generated when  a  persons   IS   IN  TUNE  with  the  cosmic
       electricity of the planet.

       Doctor Brown's findings  establish  a hard physical  basis  for  the
       mystical descriptions of  spiritual  power  given by geniuses at all
       fringes of lunacy.  Itzhak Bentov  also  found physical verification
       of entrainment of the body frequencies to that of the  Earth when in
       meditation.  This was  primarily caused by a slowed respiratory rate
       coupled with a reflected blood wave  towards  the  heart to create a
       standing wave of 7.5 CPS.
