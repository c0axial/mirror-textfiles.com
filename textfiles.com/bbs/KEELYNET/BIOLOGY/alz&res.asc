             THE EFFECTS OF CALCIUM QUANTUM DECAY AND THE ONSET OF
          ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AS A FUNCTION OF 60Hz SCALER RESONANCE.

  Alzheimer's Disease, as   we   all   know,  is  a  progressive,  incurable,
  debilitating illness, characterized by confusion and memory loss.

  It normally affects older persons, whose bones have begun to decalcify,
  and who have been found to have higher than normal amounts of aluminun
  in their brain cells.

  From the research of Dr. H.S. Lewis in the 1930's, we have learned that
  the resonant frequency of calcium is 120Hz.  Walter Russell, in his
  resonance based Periodic Chart of the Elements, has shown that elements
  occur as "notes" on an octave.

  Research by Les Brown of Canada has shown  that  elements  decay in quantum
  steps, from the same note on one octave to a lower octave.  In other words,
  zinc decays into  calcium,  which decays into aluminum,  and  the  resonant
  frequency drops accordingly,  from 240Hz, to 120Hz, to 60Hz.  This is shown
  on Russell's chart as the E note, going from octaves seven to six to five.

  Various means of resonating an element  can  cause  the  quantum  decay, as
  demonstrated by Les  Brown.  Resonantly exciting an element  increases  the
  motion, friction and  heat  of  the  atomic  particles, pushing the element
  closer to decay.

  Every electrical power cord that is plugged  into a wall outlet, whether it
  is conducting current or not, is emitting a scaler wave of  120Hz, which is
  exactly double the  frequency  of  the  60Hz  wall current.  All AC powered
  electrical appliances, power lines, televisions,  computers, etc., emit the
  same 120Hz scalar wave.

  The human brain,  comprised  of two halves, is a scalar  receiver.   It  is
  possible that the  naturally  occuring  decalcification  process  is  being
  unnaturally affected by exposure to  artificially  created  scaler  energy,
  hastening the decay of calcium into aluminum.  This would become the onset
  of Alzheimers Disease.

  If this is  true, then there is also a cure, a sort of  "fur  of  the  dog"
  analogy, via resonating  the  aluminum  to hasten its decay.  This would be
  done through creation of a 30Hz AC signal,  emitting 60Hz scaler energy, to
  eliminate the aluminum.

  The aluminum would become lithium, which has been shown  to  have the exact
  opposite effect as  aluminum,  ie,  increased awareness, heightened memory,
  etc.

                                     Page 1





  This would seem  to  have  a  double  benefit,  in  that  the 30Hz AC would
  encourage a Beta state (see MIND13.ASC)  to  increase  awareness, while the
  60Hz scaler energy would help to reduce the aluminum in the cells.

  I realize that there will be much opposition to this theory,  as  the  60Hz
  energy which we  all  use  is so prevalent in our society.  Because we have
  all been assured that it is "harmless" in normal radiation, we may not want
  to believe otherwise.  We can at least  begin to gather data, by asking the
  following questions:

  1.  Is the  rate  of Alzheimer's on a per capita basis the  same,  in  both
      developed and undeveloped countries?

  2.  Is there any difference in the per capita rate between countries
      which use 60Hz current, and those who use 50Hz current?

  3.  Has the per capita rate of this country increased since the turn of
      the century, with the "electrification" of the nation?

  4.  Is the rate of occurance greater in areas which have more energy
      "in the air", such as along power line routes, around generating
      stations, etc.

  More research is needed, obviously, but I believe that the potential is
  promising.
