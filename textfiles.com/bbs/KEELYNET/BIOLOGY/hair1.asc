                     Hair Growth through Electric Stimulation

         A Vancouver  company claims they have developed a device which can
                       cure baldness and induce hair growth.

          It takes the form of a domed hood  that stimulates the scalp with
          painless low-voltage shocks.

          The company says that 29 of 30 men in a clinical test experienced
          new hair growth after a series of weekly 12-minute treatments.

          From tests run to date, reports indicate an amazing  hair  growth
          with an average increase of 66%.

       Vangard notes

          Ron Barker  has  a friend in Michigan, Dr. Cottrell who is into a
          variety of unusual science areas.   He  showed Ron a device which
          has been on the market since the early 30's.

          It uses high voltage discharges to stimulate growth by increasing
          oxidation at the hair follicles of the scalp.  It is known as the
          "Master Violet Ray" and is familiar to many cosmeticians.

          The units  are  still available for about $50 to  $85.00.   These
          units are available at many flea markets.  We have bought several
          for $5  and  up.   Some  work,  some  don't,  some  have a better
          electrode assortment included.

          The "Master Violet Ray" uses  a  Tesla  coil  to  generate a high
          voltage continuous discharge which excites a combination of gases
          contained in a variety of glass electrodes.

          When these  gases are excited, they fluoresce to  emit  a  bright
          violet light.   We  have  heard  that  the particular frequencies
          emitted by this unit are supposed to have a salutary (beneficial)
          effect on the subject.

          One of  the  electrodes  takes  the  form  of a comb with about 5
          "teeth" made of glass fingers about  1/4"  in diameter.  It looks
          more like a garden rake, although it is intended to function as a
          comb.

          Another electrode looks like a flattened disc, while  others  are
          more pointed.

          The idea  is  quite  logical although the application to date has
          not been optimally designed.

       Notes for Experimenters

          We of Vangard Sciences have studied  the  alleged  claims  of the
          "Master Violet Ray" and found them to not be based on the optimum
          means of achievement.  This is in regard to the claims to restore
          hair growth.

          The following  known  facts might lead us to the  most  efficient
          design :

              1)  we  know  that  electrical current flows from positive to
                  negative (more  precisely,  from  the  area  of  greatest
                  potential   to   that  of  the  least,  negative/positive
                  notwithstanding)

              2)  oils are repulsed by electrostatic potentials

              3)  hair  follicles  die  when  the  sebaceous  glands become
                  clogged with  oil,  this  in  turn  attracts  loose  dust
                  particles which block the pores and reduces oxidation

              4)  Tesla invented an "electronic shower" which made the body
                  the anode  and  the walls the cathode, when  electrically
                  excited, electrostatic  repulsion of the oils on the skin
                  surface of the body carried the dirt with it to the walls

          As you can see, the effects, if  any,  of the "Master Violet Ray"
          would come  primarily from the generation of ionizing  potentials
          both from high voltage and the UV light.

          UV has  hidden dangers in the form of rays having a wavelength of
          260 NM.  Rays in this area are  extremely dangerous and have been
          shown to cause either cell destruction or mutation.

          Water vapor will shield this band to some degree by diffusion and
          molecular absorption.  At one time, the earth  was  covered  by a
          water jacket.

          We do  not  know  if  it  took  the form of a very thick vapor or
          possibly a layer of floating water in the upper stratosphere.

          This was before the Flood when  Men  lived  to around 1000 years.
          Also, records from before the flood, state that the sky was BLUE,
          not BLACK.  This would indicate the diffusion of starlight from a
          water barrier.


                                      Page 2





          At any  rate,  it  is extremely dangerous to expose oneself to UV
          light.  Not only does it accelerate  the aging process, but there
          is a high probability of generating cancer or some  other form of
          somatic (cell) mutation.

          A low  voltage  current  applied  to the body can stimulate ionic
          flows and  achieve the same basic  effect  of  cleaning  out  the
          follicles, thus allowing oxidation and the re-stimulation of hair
          growth.

          One of the dangers to be aware of when working in these areas, is
          the polarizing effect of DIRECT CURRENT.

          Negative current  causes  a  compacting  of  tissues   with   the
          generation of  alkalies.   This will cause the skin to harden and
          create areas of thick, calloused tissue.

          Positive current  causes  an   expanding   of  tissues  with  the
          generation of  acids.   This  will  cause the affected  cells  to
          dissolve by breaking down the structure.

          The pulse  width  and  frequency  obviously  will  play a part in
          determining the degree of cell compliance to the polarizing force
          evinced.

          One interesting  experiment  with   such  polarizing  forces  was
          carried out  using a raw egg.  An electrode was  inserted  inside
          the egg  and  a negative potential was applied.  Over a period of
          hours, the  egg "cooked" or hardened  up  due  to  the  increased
          compaction of the cell structure.

          When a  positive  potential  was applied, the same  hardened  egg
          became watery and soft as the cell structures were broken down.

          Bi-Phasic currents  (alternating)  MUST  be the only type used on
          the body for safety.  The pulse  width  and  frequency  should be
          adjustable to allow the greatest variation for experimentation.

          Another desirable  feature  would  be a phase adjustment  in  the
          event you choose to introduce more than one frequency.

          Be forewarned,  electrical  experiments  with the body can create
          problems which you really don't need.
