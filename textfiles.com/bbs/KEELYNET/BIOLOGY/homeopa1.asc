                     Laboratory Verification of Homeopathy?

    New York (AP)

    A prestigious journal  announced  today  it will launch  an  independent
    investigation of a  series  of  experimental  findings  that  have  been
    CONFIRMED AROUND THE  WORLD  yet DEFY  ANY  CONCEIVABLE  (?)  scientific
    explanation.

    Researchers at five separate laboratories in France, Canada,  Israel and
    Italy reported today  they  have  identified a curious antibody reaction
    involving human blood cells that should,  by  any  imaginable theory, be
    impossible.

    "It's unbelievable and  it  breaks  all  the rules,"  said  one  of  the
    researchers, Patricia Fortner,  an  immunology research associate at the
    University of Toronto.

    The researchers have found that antibodies that react with certain blood
    cells will continue to react when diluted  far  beyond  the  point where
    they should theoretically be able to.

    The reaction occurs   EVEN  AT  EXTREME  DILUTIONS   where   there   are
    theoretically NO ANTIBODY MOLECULES LEFT in the solution, said Fortner.

    "This has really  shaken up our world," she said.  "Even people who have
    seen this phenomenon FIND IT HARD  TO  BELIEVE,  because  it's  hard  to
    conceive what could be happening here."

    The report appears in Nature, an influential British medical journal.

    Nature's editors were  as  perplexed  by  the  research   as   were  the
    researchers.  Its referees  -  scientific  experts  chosen to affirm the
    soundness of the research before it  is  published  - DIDN'T BELIEVE THE
    RESULT BUT COULDN'T  FIND  ANYTHING  WRONG  WITH  THE   CONDUCT  OF  THE
    EXPERIMENTS, the magazine said.

    The scientist principally  responsible  for  the inexplicable results is
    Dr. Jacques Benveniste of INSERM, the French medical research institute.

    The findings are an outgrowth of his efforts to develop a new blood test
    to identify allergies.

    Fortner, Bruce Pomeranz and others  at  the  University  of Toronto have
    independently duplicated Benveniste's  findings,  as have  two  research
    groups in Israel and one in Milan, Fortner said.

    In its statement,  Nature  said  of  the findings, "There is no physical
    basis for such an activity.  With the  kind  collaboration  of Professor
    Benveniste, Nature has therefore arranged for independent  investigators
    to observe repetitions of the experiments."

    Other findings by  Benveniste  have added further mystery.  For example,
    the phenomenon occurs  only when the  extremely  diluted  solutions  are
    mixed violently in the laboratory, said Fortner.  Without  this  violent
    shaking, called SUCCUSSION, nothing happens.

    Why? Unkown, Fortner said.

    Furthermore, if the  extremely  diluted  solutions are HEATED OR FROZEN,
    which would destroy any antibodies in  them, THE REACTION DOESN'T OCCUR,
    Fortner said.

    Yet there aren't supposed to be any antibodies present,  so the question
    is: What is being changed?

    Benveniste's findings fuel    a    long-standing    dispute   over   the
    effectiveness of a  controversial school  of  disease  treatment  called
    HOMEOPATHY.


    "Homeopathy basically says  that the same substance  that  can  cause  a
    problem - if you can identify that element and dilute it into very small
    doses, INFINITESIMAL DOSES,  it  can CURE or AMELIORATE those symptoms,"
    said Robert Matsuk,  a  pharmacist  at  Boiron-Borneman,  a  homeopathic
    pharmaceutical.

    This paper was one of the original US releases of this story, subsequent
    investigation was done  by  of  all people, the AMAZING  RANDI  and  the
    editor of Nature.   Could  you  possibly choose more qualified people to
    judge a medical/biological experiment??

    Apparently, water and fluids in general  can temporarily "record" energy
    patterns which can then be ingested to affect the body.

    In homeopathy, this  "treated" fluid, water or alcohol,  is  allowed  to
    permeate a sugar cube for a more permanent "capture" of the pattern.

    Obviously, any field  influence  which  is  stronger  will  overcome the
    pattern which is held in the fluid,  so  a  more  "frozen" form would be
    less susceptible to outside influences.

    The body is comprised of a large quantity of fluid which makes it highly
    susceptible to "patterns".    These  can  be  any  type   of   energetic
    disturbance from magnetism  to  light  to sound, etc.. Refer to DNAMAST1
    and DNAMAST2 for further information.
