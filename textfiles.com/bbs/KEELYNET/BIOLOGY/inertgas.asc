>

>   electric field high up in the atmosphere and, of course, Earth's

>

>   lessons about love from one lifetime to the next, in this way

>

>
>    CASE HISTORIES AND APPLICATIONS:
>
>    HELIUM
>
>   picture of igd aimed into glass of water We found that if we take one

>   top of the head out the Crown Chakra. The Helium in the water seems to
>   be able to move through the blood and open that up that Chakra. We've

>   have found they can get much more deep and refreshing sleep with the
>   device. However, we've also had to moderate it. If the magnetic field
>   is too strong, or the device is too close to them, they will actually
>   have difficulty waking up or they'll wake up feeling groggy. The idea
>   is to find the right blend. Generally, that is going to be a fairly
>   low magnetic stimulation on the order of 200 or 300 gauss, and a
>   distance away from the person of about 4 to 8 feet. Deeper, more

>   dislocations, bruises, etc.
>
>    NEON
>

>   We have a few cases of individuals having difficulty with conception

>
>    ARGON
>
>   I've already discussed its use in negative thought form destruction,
>   for which it seems to be quite powerful. You might be quite surprised
>   to see how many people benefit from that. It seems to also assist with

>   their body while they're nourishing themselves in sleep.
>
>    KRYPTON
>
>   Besides having the negative thought form destruction characteristics
>   I've already observed, Krypton seems to improve psychic abilities.
>   People who use it regularly will generally notice things happening in
>   the Third Eye. Krypton Elixir is especially interesting. Channeled

>   Dilantin completely, and has had no drugs or seizures since. It has
>   now been two years! That's after just one bottle of Krypton Elixir.

>
>    XENON
>

>   and skin. But for blood engorged organs, for parts of the body where
>   blood is used, then we usually mix Argon with the Xenon. For the
>   regenerative system, we use Neon mixed with Xenon. Lastly, one I've
>   experimented a lot with is a combination of Xenon with small amounts
>   of Argon and Krypton. This seems to be very helpful for lungs. When I
>   expose myself to it, I experience something very similar to how I feel

>   of lightness and increased energy.
>
>    GENERAL APPLICATION
>

Hi Bill!

In Theosophy, there are seven 'rays' of energy which correspond to 7 energies,
each ruled by a specific archetype or entity..

Hilarion is the 5th ray and is the name of the entity who understands all of
the science aspects of the Universe.

Maurice Cooke is the businessman who began hearing voices in his head and
began writing down what was being 'channeled'.  Now I don't think very much of
channeling because it has been so greatly abused and scammed by the New Age
movement, but when someone comes up with technology through such sources, you
have to pay attention.  Maurice Cooke is one such person.

There is a complete set of books of channeled material, my favorite being 'The
Nature of Reality' and the other 'Einstein Doesn't Live here Anymore'.  The
book on Einstein gives all the details and experiments done with the inert gas
generators and I know several people who either make them or have used them to
heal various problems.

They found that you could use one or more of these inert gases to produce
various laser beam type effects.  One case in particular that fascinates me, a
very obese woman was asking for help in losing weight as everything she had
tried failed.  A psychic was called in who claimed to be able to see the
'aura' (electrodynamic, morphogenetic, bioplasmic field that I know consider
an attenuated Meissner field, self-organizing).

You see, the aura is the matrix which provides the pattern in which the tissue
grows.  Change the aura and you change the body, just like iron filings and
magnetic fields....it is a slow process of change because of the density and
nature of the material being arranged.

Anyway, this psychic said this woman had a very large bubble in her aura.
They used an inert gas generator TO CUT AWAY THAT BUBBLE.  Over the next few
weeks, the obese woman began to lose large amounts of weight without any
changes in her diet or activities.  Then, she began to gain the weight back.
The psychic again looked at her aura and found THE BUBBLE HAD GROWN BACK.
Why?  The mind is capable of 'modulating' to aura to a great degree.  This
woman had not changed her MENTAL CONCEPT of herself, thus the aura, though
physically cut away, HAD REGROWN due to her mental influence.

There is mind over matter and we experience it daily by the simple fact of our
movement and existence...how can a 'cerebral field' project threads that can
move matter such as our arms and legs simply by our WILLING it to happen.
Keely called this the 'cerebellic field' and said that a 'sympathetic
attendant' was extruded by virtue of this field to enable mental control over
mass.  Kind of like the 'ectoplasmic thread' that was extended by mediums and
photographed on so many occasions in the late 1800s and early 1900s.

Anyway, they again cut away this aura bubble and this time had the woman
change her mental picture of herself....she again lost weight and this time
kept it off by using imagery.

Well, there is quite a body of information about this and much of it
correlates.....I know many people have hard time with the Aura and Kirlian
photography, but when you look at some of the photos and see what Chuck Shram
 has done with is AURAVIEW pictures down in Houston, there is little question
in my opinion, that this is a valid approach to disease, aging and health.

What would be a great experiment to do, use a Kirlian system, either Shramek
or simply film, in as REALTIME a mode as possible in conjunction with these
inert gas generators in hopes of allowing us to see not only the beam of
energy but also its effect on matter, living and nonliving.

Oh, one other point.  It is important to understand WHERE the energy comes
from in the inert gas generators......Hilarion says the universe is
constructed from energy that flows from a hyperspace region INTO our 3 space.
Protons are radiative and are 'hyperspace electrons' that have passed through
the gateway INTO OUR 3SPACE, while electrons are 'hyperspace protons' that are
in process of passing FROM our 3 space INTO HYPERSPACE, appearing there AS
PROTONS.

Energy coming FROM hyperspace appears in the form of 'primary points' of
energy using the inert gases as the medium of transfer.  Thus, the more inert
gas you can accumulate, the more primary points can be gathered and focussed
for specific uses.  These primary points are the 'hyperspace gateways' that I
believe can be expanded or artificially created for ZPE tapping.

Anyway, Hilarion is not a joke because of the simple fact that some of what he
says has led to entirely new experiments.  If you can get them, please get
'Nature of Reality' and the 'Einstein doesn't live here Anymore', they are
well worth the investment......
