                Effects of Radio Waves gets Wider Laboratory Study

           (This second  article in The New York Times of April 6 describes
            Mr. John Osmundsen's interview  with  Dr.  A. J. Ginsberg after
            reporting the  previous  week  on  parallel work  by  Dr.  John
            Heller.  The importance of this work may be judged by the large
            number of   University   research  programmes  that  are  being
            diverted in the United States  to  the  effect  of  radio  wave
            frequencies on  health,  although  for  years  scientists  have
            denied that  such effects are possible.  It is to be hoped that
            the work and research at the  DelaWarr  Laboratories  will  now
            receive more serious attention.....The Editor)

       Research into the harmful effects and the possibly  beneficial  uses
       of high-frequency radio  waves  on  living  things is reported to be
       expanding rapidly in laboratories in the United States and Canada.

       Investigations sponsored by the armed  services  are  going on in at
       least ten American   Universities  and  research  institutes.    The
       research is aimed  at providing knowledge that will make it possible
       to live safely with the increasingly powerful radar and other micro-
       wave generators being developed.

       Although existing devices are said to be completely safe if properly
       handled the most powerful are believed  to be potentially capable of
       causing SERIOUS DAMAGE  AT  A  DISTANCE  OF SEVERAL  MILES.   It  is
       assumed, also, that   the   implications   this   has   for  weapons
       development are being investigated.

       Parallel studies into the possible beneficial effects of much lower-
       powered pulses radio waves have been  begun or are expected to begin
       soon in fifteen or twenty other laboratories.

       This work has been instigated largely by Dr. A. J.  Ginsber,  a  New
       York physician.  He   has   reported  the  successful  treatment  of
       hundreds of cases of acute and chronic  infections  with these radio
       waves.


                                      Page 1

       Dr. Ginsberg admits  that  he  does  not know how the apparent cures
       with his so-called DiaPulse machine  were brought about.  But he has
       a theory about the ways in which pulsed high-frequency  radio  waves
       interact with living  tissues.   This  theory has interested several
       prominent investigators sufficiently   to   prompt   them  to  begin
       research into the matter, many with their own funds.

       Dr. Herman P. Schwan, Director of the Electro-Medical  Laboratory of
       the University of  Pennsylvania - who consulted with Dr. Ginsberg on
       several research programmes - is cautious  but not discouraging.  In
       a recent interview  Dr.  Schwan remarked, "There is  an  interesting
       possibility that Dr.  Ginsberg's  machine  may turn out to be a very
       important advancement in physical medicine."

       Ironically, the effect of high-frequency  radio  waves on biological
       systems that Dr.  Ginsberg believes can help relieve  infections  is
       one of the  effects  being  looked  for  by  the armed services as a
       possible hazard of high-powered radio waves.

       What both groups are looking for are  biological  responses to radio
       waves that do  not  result  from heating.  Although  these  athermal
       effects have not  been  demonstrated  conclusively  many  scientists
       engaged in this work agree that they exist.

                                 Heat Long in Use

       The fact that radio waves can cause heating in tissues has long been
       known and has been widely used to  treat  inflammations and injuries
       to joints and soft tissues.  This treatment, called  diathermy, uses
       short-wave radio frequencies.   Much  more powerful higher-frequency
       (shorter wave) radar  used  for this  purpose  would  cook  internal
       tissues.

       Dr. Ginsberg said  that in 1943 he had investigated  the  idea  that
       something other than  heating  might  be going on in tissues treated
       with diathermy.  In a paper published  in  THE  MEDICAL  RECORD  for
       December 19 of that year he reported diathermy results  that he felt
       could NOT BE ACCOUNTED for PURELY BY HEAT.

       This led him, he said, to try to eliminate the heating effect of the
       diathermy.  He explained  that the most logical means for doing this
       seemed to be to pulse the radio waves  in  such  a way that any heat
       created would be dissipated between pulses.

       With the help of Arthur Milinowski, a physicist, Dr.  Ginsberg built
       a machine for  this  purpose  and  soon,  he  claimed, supported his
       contention that there  was a beneficial  athermal  effect  of  radio
       waves on tissues.

       According to Dr.  Ginsberg's  theory the athermal effect  of  pulsed
       radio waves STIMULATES THE BODY'S DEFENSE MECHANISM, marshalling the
       system that scavenges  foreign  materials  and  tissue debris.  This
       system is believed  to  produce   antibodies   which   act   against
       infectious invaders.

       Two reports apparently substantiating claims for an  athermal effect
       were made in  the  March  28  issue  of NATURE, a British scientific
       publication, and in the RES BULLETIN, an American journal.


                                      Page 2

       Those papers carried  accounts  of  the  bizarre behaviour of micro-
       organisms and the  apparent interference  with  heredity-controlling
       material in certain plant cells CAUSED BY PULSED RADIO FREQUENCIES.

       The work, done  by  Dr.  John  H. Heller and his group  at  the  New
       England Institute for  Medical  Research  in  Ridgefield, Conn., was
       instigated by Dr. Ginsberg's search  for  scientists  to look for an
       athermal effect of pulsed radio frequencies.  A modified  version of
       Dr. Ginsberg's device  was used in the group's early work but it has
       since built its own radio pulse generator.

       Dr. Heller reported that he was UNABLE  TO  DETECT  ANY  TEMPERATURE
       RISE in the cell containing tiny micro-organisms  that  swam  either
       back and forth  or  up and down in response to different frequencies
       of the pulse radio waves.

       Dr. Schwan believes his group at the  University of Pennsylvania has
       found still another  way in which high-frequency radio  waves  might
       affect living tissues athermally.

       This is to  CHANGE  THE  PERFORMANCE OF NERVE CELLS by acting on the
       cell membrane.  How  this  would  ultimately  affect  the  organism,
       however, is not known, Dr. Schwan said.

       Dr. Schwan and several other scientists agree that a great deal must
       be learned at  a  very  fundamental level to find out  exactly  what
       effects other than heat are created by high-frequency radio waves in
       living tissues and then whether those effects are good or not. This,
       he explained, is a job that will take many years.

       In the meantime the armed services are studying means for protecting
       persons who work  around  radar  installations with radar-reflecting
       clothes and shielded buildings and passage-ways.

       Those steps would be taken largely  to  give  protection against the
       heating effects of  radar waves, which are known to  be  capable  of
       causing cataracts, reproductive cell damage and other injuries.

       The Army, Navy  and  Air Force are also continuing their sponsorship
       of extensive research programmes on  the biological effects of high-
       frequency radio wave  energy.   Progress  in  this   work   will  be
       discussed at a tri-service meeting later this year.

       And extensive clinical   studies  are  being  made  to  see  if  Dr.
       Ginsberg's idea of treating illness  with  pulsed radio waves can be
       evaluated statistically with  patients,  even  though  the  possible
       athermal effects are    not   yet   understood   biophysically   and
       physiologically.
