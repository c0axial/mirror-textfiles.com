             I would  be interested in hearing more about  transmitting
        info into the brain, if you come across any.

             I've been collecting information on how the brain analyzes &
        processes  information,  in a attempt to do  speech  recognition.
        Here  are a few of the things that I've found that your colleages
        might find useful, when transmitting info INTO the brain.   (Need
        less  to say a lot of this information is controversial,  and in
        some  cases in direct conflict with the  'medical establishment';
        but I go where the path leads....)

             The   most   interesting  work, as  well   as the   most
        controversial, in  this area has been done by G. Patrick Flanagan
        on a device  he calls the "Neurophone".

             The  basic  concept  of the Neurophone is it  has  an  audio
        input,  which  can come from a microphone, tape  recorder,  radio
        etc....   With an output that goes to two  transducers  that  you
        wear  as  a  head  band.  The  transducer  disks  are  made  from
        Zirconium  Titanate  imbedded in  acrylic  plastic  tiles  which
        possesses  the  same dielectric constant as human skin  [Any  one
        know  where  to  get such a transducer, or how  you  measure  the
        dielectric  constant of the skin?].  The end result is that  your
        brain perceives the sound that is input into the Neurophone  with
        NO  involvement of the Ear.

        Batteau of  Tuffs University  devised an experiment that proved the
        the Neurophone does NOT work by:

              (A) the transducers act as electrostatic loudspeakers,
              (B) the transducers excite  via bone conduction of the sound,
              (C) the transducers activate the Eighth Cranial Nerve.

             Flanagan hypothesizes that input to the brain is based  upon
        the  fact that the skin is both piezoelectric and  optoelectric,
        that  is,  when the skin is stimulated by an electric or  photon
        field,   it  vibrates.   This means  that  it  produces   minute
        electrical currents when vibrated or rubbed.


                                      Page 1





             Sheldon  C. Deal, D.C, N.D. of Tucson says (REF  #1):   "The
        skin is embryonically the source of all our special senses.   Our
        skin contains more sensors for heat, touch, pain, ect., than  any
        other part  of  the  human  anatomy.   The  human  ear  evolves
        embryonically out of the convolutions of the skin of an  embryo.
        Basically,  the  skin is the oldest evolutionary  nervous  system
        sensor.   Another  way to look at this, is the special  sense of
        touch has progressively extended over the entire body by way of
        the  skin  and evolutionarywise our other special  senses  should
        follow suit and extend over our entire body in time [What is that
        going to look like?].  The skin then, since it is the  precursor
        of  the  ears,  should also be cable of hearing,  or  to  put it
        another  way, it should be able to transmit the sense of  hearing
        to the brain by means other than the 8th Cranial Nerve."

             The  Zirconium  Titanate transducer  effectively  forms  a
        piezoelectric transmitter, where some thing called the  Pacinian
        Corpuscle acts as a receiver.

             The  Pacinian  Corpuscle is a  special  nerve  ending  that
        transforms   mechanical  vibration,  or  pressure,   into   nerve
        impulses.   (REF  #11)  The  Pacinian Corpuscle  consists  of  a
        sensitive  nerve  ending surrounded by  a  cylindrical-like  core
        structure consisting of closely packed membranes called lamellae.
        The core is surrounded by a second set of lamellae, in which  the
        distance   between   each  one  increases  from  the  innermost
        lamella toward the periphery of the corpuscle.  The space between
        all  the  lamellae  is  filled with  a  liquid  whose mechanical
        properties  can be  considered similar to that of water.  When  a
        displacement  of the  outermost  lamella  is caused  by  exerting
        an   appropriate  pressure, this stimulus is transmitted  to  the
        core, and  in   turn,  causes a  compression of  the  innermost
        lamella.   This  system   acts as  a  differentiating mechanical
        amplifier.

             What   all  of this gobbledygook is trying to say  is   that
        the  Pacinian Corpuscle responds best to a square  wave  signal.
        Where the  time-rate-of-change of the signal is  more  important
        than the amplitude  of the pressure applied to  the corpuscle.
        This shows  that  this  receptor is designed  to  detect  time
        significance first, and pressure significance secondly.

             Now  that  we  have gotten trough the  descriptions  of  the
        transmitter  (Zirconium  Titanate transducer) and  the  receiver
        (Pacinian Corpuscle) we can get into the interesting stuff:

                                Interesting Stuff:
                                  Nerve encoding

             In the Neurophone the input signal is passed into a  section
        which clips everything into a series of square waves,  analogous
        to  the sort of clipped waves Lisitsyn confirms are the  carriers
        of  the human brain waves (REF #8).   Next, the square waves  are
        differentiated, yielding a series of sharp spikes.  These  spikes
        are again differentiated, since these are finite spikes with real
        non-zero  rise  times and decay times  rather  than  theoretical
        constructs,  a  series of noisy spikes results  from  the  second
        differentiator   section.   From  here,  the  noisy  spikes   are
        introduced to the Zirconium Titanate transducers which are placed
        on the skin.
                                      Page 2





             In REF #6:  "It was established that the nervous system uses
        time ratios as major sources of intelligent information.  It  was
        found that  speech  intelligibility was contained  in  the  time
        dominant ratios in the speech waveform.  Speech quality was found
        to  be  contained in dominant frequency ratios.  So  the  nervous
        system is designed to recognize two distinct parameters: the time
        domain and the frequency domain."

             This is  similar  to  the  work of  Dr. Arie Visser of Extrema
        Systems International Corporation.   The  Extrema  theory  of human
        perception  assumes  that  the ear  distinguishes   sounds  not  by
        amplitude  or frequency,  but  rather  by  timing  and  context.
        Specifically, the ear extracts only certain features of a signal-
        that  is, the local minima and maxima, or the extrema and  passes
        to the brain the instances at which they occur [it doesn't matter
        whether  it is minima or maxima, just the change in direction of
        the signal is important].

        Here  is  a  starting point for  the  circuitry  for  a Neurophone,
        and a Extrema Enhancer:

             Find  your self a copy of "National Semiconductor's  "Linear
        Applications  Databook" 1986, then locate: AN-72 "The LM3900:  A
        New Current-Differencing Quad of +/- Input Amplifiers"

             For the Extrema Enhancer hook up the AN-72 stages like so:

             Input:>>----AN-72-35 4 KHz Low Pass Filter --------> (A)

        differentiators in series.

             (G)  Is  now a square wave in the Time-Domain of the  input

             signal-to-noise-ratio  [More  signal than  noise,  than  the
             original input signal], with redundant information removed).

             Heres  a starting  point for  the  Neurophone  (I'am  still
             studying how this works, so haven't got it finished yet).

             For safety reasons the Neurophone circuit should be  battery
        powered.

          So where do we go from here/hear?

       out for a hearing aid for the Deaf?

       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Vangard Notes...

            I was  fortunate  enough  to  attend a small seminar of about 5
            hours with Pat Flanagan and a  group  of about 25 others at the
            National Health  Federation  meeting  here in Dallas  somewhere
            around 1983(?).

            Pat went  into  some  detail  on the Neurophone and some of his
            other work.  The original version  put  out  a 3000 volt signal
            which was modulated by any audio signal.

            It was based on a principle called "acoustic conduction"  which
            had been an anomaly first noticed in the early days of radio.

            The effect can be demonstrated by attached a "Chore Girl" scrub
            pad to  the output of any audio amplifier system.  The positive
            lead goes to one pad, the negative  to  another.   The pads are
            then applied to the ear, the amplifier tuned to  a music source
            and cranked   up.    You   will   hear   the   music  from  the
            electrostatically driven threads of the scrub pad.

            Flanagan figured that the principle  could  be "enhanced" which
            led to  fine tuning using an oscilloscope and other  equipment.
            From these  humble beginnings came the first Neurophone using a
            vacuum tube amplifier capable of generating the audio modulated
            3000 volts.

            The next improvement came when Pat found that the human nervous
            system vibrated within a range  of 50 KHZ to 100 KHZ.  He found
            that by   transmitting   an   acoustically  modulated   carrier
            frequency which  would  match  the  current  vibrations  of the
            nervous system, the two frequencies would "tune in" leaving the
            audio frequencies.

            This system uses a 20 volt peak  to  peak  signal  and requires
            some training to be able to use the device.  Training  involves
            audibly listening  to music which is simultaneously transmitted
            via the Neurophone into the nervous system.

            As one continues, the audible  volume  is  gradually  decreased
            which "trains"  the  system to become ever more  aware  of  the
            Neurophonically driven signals.

            There have  been  strange  reports  of  experiments  using  the
            Neurophone either in groups or singly and spaced over distance.

            People have become suddenly  telepathically  linked  to  others
            operating the  Neurophone  at  the  same time.   At  one  time,
            Flanagan was  asking  for Neurophone operators to experiment in
            groups to see what the possibilities  might  be.  I never heard
            of the outcome of any of these experiments.

            Bearden mentions the possibilities of the Neurophone for

            telepathic linking among a group of minds with the same general
            purposes (much like witchcraft).  He believes that those people
            might unknowingly awaken a great mind which he calls ZARG.

            This mind  would  be  synthesized  from the linking of the many
            smaller minds.  He also cautions  that  such an awakening might
            lead to disasters beyond our control when ZARG sees how screwed
            up everything has become from our actions.

            The Bible mentions how the linking of two or more  people  in a
            common enterprise will lead to geometrically amplified results.

            That is  the essential principle of witchcraft as well as group
            prayer in  the more socially  accepted  version.   The  stories
            relating to miracles when people pray (read  concentrate  on  a
            focussed objective) in concert are legion.

            In formal   Magick,   the  operator  uses  geometries,  intense
            concentration and words of power to generate the same result as
            witchcraft yet working on much more resolved levels of energy.

            I think the Neurophone offers  its  greatest  hope  with the 20
            volt peak to peak version.  Training of the operator  to awaken
            his innate  abilities  would  lead to the possibility of direct
            input of information to the brain  without  the filtering which
            is built in to the other methods of sensory input.

            The danger  here is the possibility of mind control  techniques
            far beyond simplified subliminals.
