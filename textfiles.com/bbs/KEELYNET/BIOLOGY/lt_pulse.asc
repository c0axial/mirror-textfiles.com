                      STAR WARS SCIENCE PROTECTS CHICKEN PIES
                                  By SARAH LUBMAN
               Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL LOS ANGELES

       OK, so maybe  it wouldn't work zapping missiles in space.  How about
       soot and bread mold?

       That's the thinking behind the purple  light flashing regularly from
       an experimental switching  device  in  a  California  lab  facility.
       Martin Gundersen, a  physics professor at the University of Southern
       California, is trying  to  turn   the   "pulsed   power"  technology
       originally developed for  Star Wars into a commercial  antipollution
       weapon.

       There's no shortage  of ideas on using pulsed power. Labs across the
       country are using it on chicken pot  pies,  mussels  and tumors. But
       now that defense funding is dwindling, there is a shortage of money.

       Pulsed power, a  way  of  storing  and rapidly releasing  electrical
       energy in powerful  bursts,  has  been  a  vital military tool since
       World War II in most radar, certain  laser  weapons  and  electrical
       guns, and simulated  nuclear  blasts.  In the 1980s  heyday  of  the
       Strategic Defense Initiative,  pulsed power was once envisioned as a
       potential space death-ray laser  to  destroy  enemy  missiles.  That
       turned out to be problematic and costly; SDI has since  moved  on to
       weapons that destroy missiles by bashing into them.

                          'Fundamental Technology Issues'

       "One of the  good  things  about  SDI  was  that  it  got  a  lot of
       scientists looking into fundamental  technology issues that are more
       significant than getting   huge   lasers  into  space,"   says   Mr.
       Gundersen, who has a kindly manner and eyebrows that seem to have
       a life of  their  own.  He  joined  USC in 1980 to do laser research
       funded mostly by the Pentagon. Now,  the  professor and a few of his
       graduate students tinker  with an antipollution pulsed-power  device
       called a plasma discharge cell.

       The experiment looks  like a thick tangle of high-tech plumbing atop
       a metal platform roughly the size of ping-pong table.  The cell,

                                      Page 1





       powered by an  electrical switch, releases thousands of simultaneous
       bursts of energy a second that are visible as flashes of neon-purple
       light. A high-speed photograph of  the  process  looks like a starry
       sky, showing a cloud of tiny white dots of energy frozen  against  a
       black surface.

       Scientists have proved  that  the  chemical reaction produced by the
       intense energy pulses  can  dissolve  toxic  solvents,  as  well  as
       harmful sulfur oxides  found  in  factory  smoke. The  principle  is
       simple: Electrons generated  by  the  sudden  power  burst  run into
       molecules of noxious compounds,  literally  breaking  them  up.   In
       theory, power plants could reduce pollution by installing pulsed-
       power devices to  create  intense electrical discharges  that  would
       reduce emissions before they reach the air.

       "Through a miracle  of  physics  and  chemistry,  you can get rid of
       soot," Mr. Gundersen says. He and other scientists say the pollution
       reducing technology could  be  commercially   available  in  several
       years, if it's made more efficient.

       Scientists are already  deploying pulsed power against  bread  mold.
       Maxwell Laboratories Inc. in San Diego formed its Foodco Corp.  unit
       in 1988 to  explore  the  potential  uses  of  pulsed power for food
       processing. The company, partly owned  by  the  Kraft  General Foods
       unit of Philip  Morris  Cos. and Tetralaval of Sweden,  uses  pulsed
       power to pasteurize  liquids  without  heating  them,  and  to  kill
       bacteria on packaging and solid foods.

                                 Chicken-Pot Pies

       Sixteen chicken-pot pies, most of them moldy, sit on a metal cart in
       Foodco's microbiology lab. But mold  hasn't  attacked  four  or five
       pies that have been treated by a light-sterilization  method  dubbed
       Pure-Bright. The technology works on processed foods such as pies by
       zapping them, through  their plastic packaging, with 20 to 30 pulses
       of light lasting a few hundredths of a second each.

       The combination of  the  type of light  and  pulse  frequency  kills
       bacteria, extending the shelf life of foods 'for weeks  or  months,"
       says Alan C. Kolb, Maxwell's chief executive officer.  If regulators
       approve, commercial use  could  come  in a year to 16 months, Foodco
       says.

       A big advantage to pulsed power, some scientists say, is its ability
       to perform the  same tasks as radiation  without  the  harmful  side
       effects. Pulsed-power advocates  note  that  irradiation   of  foods
       requires extra protection  for  technicians  and  has  alarmed  some
       consumer groups; they  also  contend   pulsed  power  can  wipe  out
       bacteria without the physical and chemical changes radiation causes.
       (However, Dr. Elsa Murano, a microbiologist researching  irradiation
       at lowa State   University,   says  irradiation  facilities  require
       protective concrete walls, but that  the  technology  doesn't change
       food "in any way different from cooking or freezing.")

       That principle is fueling experiments with pulsed-power  laser beams
       for cancer treatment  and  other medical applications. At the Baylor
       Research Institute in Dallas, scientists  are working with lasers to
       wipe out tumors.

       Other promising uses for pulsed power include spot welding, powering
       electric vehicles, reducing  diesel-engine  exhaust  fumes, and even
       pest control. There's  an  experiment   under  way  in  Springfield,
       Calif., to see if pulsed power can stem a growing invasion  of zebra
       mussels by creating underwater shock waves to crush their shells.

       Despite growing interest,  though,  pulsed-power  researchers face a
       bureaucratic hurdle over reduced and reallocated funding.

       So some scientists are starting to venture out of their laboratories
       and into the public eye in search  of  capital.  A  workshop  on the
       commercial applications of pulsed power, the first  of  its kind, is
       slated for August.

       But the uncharted  move  from  lab  to  consumer  may  be  the  most
       difficult experiment of all. "There's  such a gap between people who
       do research and people who are more entrepreneurial in spirit," says
       USC's Mr. Gundersen, who plans to attend the workshop  and  hopes  a
       few venture capitalists will show up.
