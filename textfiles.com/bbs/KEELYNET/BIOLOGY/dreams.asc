       Design Your Own Dreams

       [THIS FEATURE IS PART OF AN EXPERIMENT BEING SPONSORED BY OMNI TO
       HELP SCIENTISTS REFINE CERTAIN DREAM TECHNIQUES NOW BEING STUDIED
       IN  THE  LAB.   THE  FULL EXPERIMENT APPEARS IN  THE  APRIL  OMNI
       MAGAZINE.   THE  EXERCISES PRESENTED HERE ARE FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT
       WANT TO ATTEMPT A LITTLE LUCID DREAMING ON THEIR OWN.]

       Most  people  don't  realize they've been  dreaming  until  after
       they've awakened and the dream has come to an end.   Some people,
       however,  are conscious that they're dreaming.   These people  --
       called  LUCID  dreamers -- can literally direct the content of  a
       dream,  scientists  have  discovered,  deciding perhaps  to  talk
       physics with Einstein,  woo and marry a movie star, or assume the
       powers  of  Superman.  For those who have acquired the  knack  of
       lucidity, the benefits can be enormous:

       Lucid  dreaming  gives one the chance to experience  unique  and
       compelling adventures rarely surpassed elsewhere in life.   These
       experiences  can  enhance self-confidence  and  promote  personal
       growth  and  self-development.   By facing fears and learning  to
       make the best of the worst situation imaginable,  lucid  dreamers
       can overcome nightmares.   Because recent scientific studies have
       demonstrated   a   strong  connection  between  dreams  and   the
       biological functioning of the body, lucid dreams might facilitate
       physical  as well as mental health.  And finally,  because  lucid
       dreaming  allows us to tap the power of the unconscious,  it  may
       also be useful for creative problem solving.

       After nearly a decade of piloting these daring nocturnal flights,
       2  psychologists  -- Stephen LaBerge of Stanford  University  and
       author  of LUCID DREAMING [Ballantine],  and Jayne Gackenbach  of
       the University of Northern Iowa -- have begun to develop a series
       of techniques aimed at helping ordinary dreamers "turn" lucid and
       lucid  dreamers gain greater control over the woolly behemoth  of
       night.   These special techniques,  still under development, have
       never  before been presented in a public forum.   To direct  your
       own nightly dream-time show,  please attempt exercises one,  two,
       three and four as outlined below.  LaBerge and Gackenback suggest
       that you do the tasks as often as possible over a 2-week  period.
       Some  people may succeed in having a lucid dream the first  night
       they use the techniques;  others,  the researchers note, may need

                                      Page 1





       to practice for several weeks before getting results.

       EXERCISE ONE

       A  number  of techniques facilitate lucid dreaming.   One of  the
       simplest is asking yourself many times during the day whether you
       are dreaming.   Each time you ask the question,  you should  look
       for  evidence  proving you are not dreaming.   The most  reliable
       test:   Read something,  look away for a moment, and then read it
       again.   If it reads the same way twice,  it is unlikely that you
       are dreaming.  After you have proved to yourself that you are not
       presently dreaming, visualize yourself doing whatever it is you'd
       like.  Also, tell yourself that you want to recognize a nighttime
       dream  the next time it occurs.   The mechanism at work  here  is
       simple;  it's  much  the same as picking up milk at  the  grocery
       store after reminding yourself to do so an hour before.

       At  night  people  usually realize they are  dreaming  when  they
       experience unusual or bizarre occurrences.   For instance, if you
       find yourself flying without visible means of support, you should
       realize  that  this  happens  only in dreams and  that  you  must
       therefore be dreaming.   If you awaken from a dream in the middle
       of  the  night,  it  is  very helpful  to  return  to  the  dream
       immediately,   in   your  imagination.    Now  envision  yourself
       recognizing the dream as such.   Tell yourself,  "The next time I
       am dreaming, I want to remember to recognize that I am dreaming."
       If  your  intention  is strong and clear  enough,  you  may  find
       yourself in a lucid dream when you return to sleep.

       EXERCISE TWO:  DREAM FLYING

       Many lucid dreamers report dreams in which they fly unaided, much
       like  Superman.   Some  lucid  dreamers  say  that  flying  is  a
       thrilling means of travel; others, that it has helped them return
       from  one of the more harrowing dream experiences -- the  endless
       fall.   Flying  is  so  important because it's a  form  of  dream
       control  that's fairly easy to master.   It gives the dreamer  an
       exhilirating sense of freedom.   And it's a basic means of travel
       in the dream world.  During the 2-week period of your experiment,
       try to focus on dream flight.   If you're falling, turn that fall
       into  flight:   Remember,  there's no gravity in dreams.  And  if
       you're simply going from here to there,  do it with flight.  This
       simple activity will cue you in to the fact that you  are,  after
       all, in a dream.

       How  do  you make dream flight happen at all?   We  suggest  that
       before  you  retire  for  bed,  you simply  repeat  these  words:
       "Tonight I fly!"  Then,  while still awake, imagine that journey.
       If you find yourself flying, it will be a clear sign that you are
       in  a  dream.   In any case,  when you realize  you're  dreaming,
       remember that you want to fly.   When you actually feel  yourself
       flying, say, "This is a dream."  Make sure you start modestly, by
       simply  floating above the surface of your dream ground.   As you
       gain  confidence both in the notion that you are dreaming and  in
       your  ability to control that experience,  you  might  experiment
       with  flying a bit more.   Run,  taking big leaps,  and then stay
       aloft  for  a  few seconds,  so that you  resemble  an  astronaut
       walking on the moon.   Try sustained floating and then flying  at
       low altitudes.

                                      Page 2





       As your confidence increases,  so will your flying skills.  While
       asleep,  work on increasing your altitude,  maneuverability,  and
       speed.   As  with  speed sports,  you should perfect  height  and
       maneuverability  before speed.   Of course,  you couldn't  really
       hurt  yourself -- it's only a dream.   But you COULD get  scared.
       After you have become proficient in dream flying, remember to ask
       yourself  these questions:   "How high can I fly?  Can I view the
       earth  from  outer  space?   Can I travel so  fast  that  I  lose
       awareness of my surroundings and experience the sensation of pure
       speed?"   Throughout your efforts in dream flight,  remember that
       you're in a dream.   With this in mind, your fear will be held at
       bay, and your control over the dream will be greatly enhanced.

       EXERCISE THREE:  DREAM SPINNING

       Even if you're a frequent lucid dreamer,  you may not be able  to
       stop  yourself  from  waking up in mid-drem.   And even  if  your
       dreams  do reach a satisfying end,  you may not be able to  focus
       them  exactly  as  you please.   During our  years  of  research,
       however,  we have found that spinning your dream body can sustain
       the period of sleep and give you greater dream control.  In fact,
       many  subjects  at  Stanford University have  used  the  spinning
       technique as an effective means of staying in a lucid dream.  The
       task  outlined  below will help you use spinning as  a  means  of
       staying asleep,  and,  more exciting,  as a means of traveling to
       whatever dream world you desire.

       As  with dream flying,  the dream spinning task starts before you
       go to bed.  Before retiring,  decide on a person, time, and place
       you would like to visit in your lucid dream.   The target  person
       and  place  can be either real or  imaginary,  past,  present  or
       future.   Write  down and memorize your target person and  place,
       then  visualize yourself visiting your target and firmly  resolve
       to  do so in a dream that night.   When following this procedure,
       it's  possible that you might find yourself visiting your  target
       in a nonlucid dream; you will be aware that this has happened, of
       course,  only after you awaken.   Nevertheless, you should strive
       for  lucidity  by following the techniques outlined  in  exercise
       one.  Then proceed to your goal.

       To do so, repeat the phrase describing your target in your dream,
       and  spin your whole dream body in a standing position with  your
       arms outstretched.  You can pirouette or spin like a top, as long
       as  you  vividly  feel your body in  motion.  The  same  spinning
       technique  will help when,  in the middle of a lucid  dream,  you
       feel  the dream imagery beginning to fade.   To avoid waking  up,
       spin  as  you repeat your target phrase  again  and  again.  With
       practice,  you'll  return to your target person,  time and place.
       When  spinning,  try  to  notice  whether you  are  moving  in  a
       clockwise or counterclockwise direction.

       EXERCISE FOUR:  CREATIVE DREAMING

       Up  until now we have had little control over the  occurrence  of
       creative  dreams.  But with lucid dreaming it may be possible  to
       intentionally access the creativity of the dream state.   You can
       help  determine  the  feasibility of this idea by  attempting  to
       solve  a  problem in a lucid dream.   Before  bed,  decide  on  a
       problem you would like to solve.   Frame your problem in the form

                                      Page 3





       of a question.  For example, "What is the topic of my next book?"
       "How  can I become less shy?" If you have an illness,  you  might
       consider the problem, "How can I regain my health?"

       Once  you  have selected a problem question,  write it  down  and
       memorize   it.    When  doing  the  lucid-dreaming   introduction
       exercises,  remember  your question and see yourself looking  for
       the  answer  in your next lucid dream.   Then,  when in  a  lucid
       dream, ask the question and seek the solution.  You might be most
       successful  at problem solving if you try a direct approach.  For
       instance, if your problem is health, try to heal yourself in your
       dream.   Then  reflect on how your dream solution relates to  the
       waking problem.   It may help to question other dream characters,
       especially if they represent people who you think might know  the
       answer.   You  can even combine this task with the dream spinning
       and flying tasks,  visiting an expert on your problem.   You  can
       also  just  explore your dream world with your question in  mind,
       looking for any clues that might suggest an answer.
