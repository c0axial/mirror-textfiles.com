Oh no, there is really *NO CONCERNS* if you you prepare your Kombucha tea
according to proven rules with thought and carefulness;

Just see what the "German FDA" says:

KOMBUCHA IS A VITALIZING AND COMPLETELY HARMLESS BEVERAGE

Especially in health shops, the Asian tea mushroom "Kombucha" is praised as a
universal panacea. But are there some hidden negative side effects involved as
well?

Prof. Dr. Dr. F. Staib (Robert-Koch-Institute of the German Public Health
Department*) answers this question of a worried doctor:

   "Kombucha consists of a jelly-like substance which develops from a sort of
    a symbiosis of fermenting yeasts and acetic bacteria in sugared black tea.
    The resulting products are alcohol, carbonic acid and various organic
    acids, which can be enjoyed as a vitalizing beverage known in Russia as
    'tea-kwass'.

    No harmful effects on health have been discovered so far.  And what is
    more, such effects are highly unlikely due to natural preservation
    substances which also develop during the short fermentation process."

*) The German Health Department is the corresponding organisation to the
   American FDA.

Translated by Gunther Frank from "Hessische Allgemeine
Sonntagszeitung" Nr. 24, June 14, 1992, page 24

The Kombucha Mushroom protects itself.  In Russian reports it is even
mentioned that no special precautionary measures are needed because the the
mushroom protects itself against impurities.

It has a number of protective features: the organic acids, the low alcoholic
content, carbonic acid. All these jointly block the development of all foreign
microorganisms not belonging to the Kombucha organism..

The Russian researcher I.N. Konovalow mentions in his report of 1959, that the
intensive growth of the Kombucha culture leven and bacteria distinctly
suppresses the spreading of other yeast and bacterial varieties. Also the
Russian Proffessor G.F. Barbancik (1958) reports of tests which showed that
the Kombucha microrganisms drive out all other microbes energetically
(antagonism).

Because the Kombucha culture grows cheerfully and is parted willingly, all
friends and aquaintances can soon benefit.  It is a good custom to pass on the
Kombucha mushroom to other people as a sign of friendship and mutual
helpfulness.  May Kombucha provide all of you many benefits.

Gunther
