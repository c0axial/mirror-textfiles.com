                          Testing of Manipulative Skills

          A machine  for  measuring  human  coordination,  EPIC (Electronic
       Programmable Interactive Coorditester/Trainer)   is  another  device
       developed from NASA technology. It is expected that  many  uses will
       be found, not   only   in   biomedicine,   rehabilitation,  and  the
       physiology of muscular  coordination   but   also  in  job  aptitude
       testing, law enforcement,  and  highway  safety.  In  rehabilitation
       work, for example,  test  results can show progress or indicate need
       for remedial help.

          EPIC is derived from a NASA prototype  to test pilot manipulative
       skills and determine effects of fatigue on their dexterity. In using
       EPIC, colored lights  are  flashed  on a display panel.  The  person
       being tested, using  hand  and  foot  controls,  tries  to match the
       lights on his panel.

          The lights  are  constantly  changed,   calling   for  continuous
       reactions from the person being tested.
