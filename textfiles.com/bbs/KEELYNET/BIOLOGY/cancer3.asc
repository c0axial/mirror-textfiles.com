       #1.  Every cancer  that  has  been  studied, has been classified and
            based on DIFFERENCES between the cancers; but breast cancer and
            many other types of cancer known  to  man  goes through similar
            stages.  The  1st  stage of growth almost always  involves  the
            alteration of the DNA of just ONE Single Cell.

       #2.  Two of  the  known  major  causes  of cancers are radiation and
            chemicals.  Researchers studied  the  different  effects  these
            produce in  various  tissues without realizing  that  the  SAME
            MUTATION of otherwise normal, cellular DNA, was taking place in
            each tissue in which cancer emerges.

       #3.  Researchers worked  many  years to finally find that DNA is the
            genetic apparatus which CONTROLS  the  functions and activities
            of a normal cell. The simpler facts never surfaced however.

            The fact went unnoticed that all the cells IN  A  GIVEN  TISSUE
            must operate IN THE SAME MANNER, because they all have the same
            DNA.

            Instead, over  the  decades, a great many specialized fields of
            research came into being and these caused the general direction
            of cancer  research to flow along  ever  increasing,  DIVERGENT
            lines.

            No one could see what was happening. Everyone was working their
            way outward, away from the center of the initial findings.

            It took years to find that almost everything had moved OUTWARD,
            like spokes  on  a  gigantic  wheel.  Today, all  of  mankind's
            research on cancer can be compared to forever moving out to the
            edges, after originally starting at the middle of a big pizza.

            As the  overall  field  of cancer research continued to rapidly
            grow it quite frankly lacked any real direction.

       #4.  What complicated  matters  even   more  was  the  abundance  of
            specialized fields of study.  Cut each pizza slice  into ten or
            a dozen  pieces  and  you  have  some  idea  of  what "the pie"
            represents over the years.

       #5.  All that  led  to the formation of inter-disciplinary "research
            teams." Grant agencies began  to use funding requirements "as a
            means" to  cause  different  fields  of researchers  to  better
            communicate.

            In order  to  truly figure out cancer, however, some one had to
            learn each of the basic languages  and in the descriptive terms
            for each of those different fields.

            It took  this  researcher  more  than a decade  to  develop  an
            adeqate understanding  of  the  scientific  principles  of each
            different field of research.  All the cancer research was never
            LOGICALLY ORDERED before; it took many years of  study  just to
            figure that out.

            Many more  years  went into a very extensive survey of the many
            aspects of fields of canncer  research.  In the final analysis,
            I did manage to solve the overall puzzle by way of constructing
            a CONVERGENT OVERVIEW of the whole field of research.

            Each of  the many fields of specialized research  was,  and  is
            yet, based on its own highly independent system of logic. There
            is no need to look any further as to why the research community
            has been left in such a very unproductive mode.

            Everyone has  been attempting to fit together all the pieces of
            the gigantic jig-saw puzzle of  cancer, in effect, while taking
            the puzzle pieces out of a great many different puzzle boxes!

       #7.  Today, if one is unaware of the true facts, every  doctor  will
            have come  up  with  his  or  her own idea on what is or is not
            important in regard to cancers.

            Most KNOW that DNA works even  when it is taken out of the cell
            of one  species  and  put inside another but no  one  had  ever
            recognized the  overwhelming  importance  of  how DNA can cause
            cancers.

            OBVIOUSLY, what happens to the  cells in a plant, as seen here,
            IS THE SAME THING WHICH HAPPENS TO THE CELLS OF A HUMAN.

            And in that the transfer of bacteria into DNA  is  what  causes
            cancers to  emerge  in a plant such as the apple tree. THIS HAS
            BEEN PROVEN  and  is  obviously  the  exact  same  thing  which
            produces cancer in both men and animals.

       #8.  In the  early  1900's  researchers tried to  see  if  the  same
            bacteria which causes plant cancers could also cause cancers in
            man or in other animals.

            The idea  that  an  alike class or type of bacteria could cause
            the same TYPE of transformation  in  man did not occur to them,
            and man's  knowledge  of  the  interchangeable   features   and
            properties of DNA would not be known for another 50 years.

       #9.  It is now time that our researchers and Doctors come to a firm
            understanding of  the  topic  of "DNA infections," and the fact
            that everyone has  been trained  to  talk  and think ONLY along
            the lines of normal bacterial involvement.  This line of

                                      Page 2





            thinking does  not  fit  at  at  all  well,  with  the  current
            situation.

            In general, we suppose it is  thought  to  be,  too  simple  to
            believe that the inner-linked DNA from a bacteria  has been the
            hidden cause of cancer all along.

            In reply  there  is  no other mechanism known to man, which has
            the ability to cause such a standardized type of DNA FAILURE in
            that it obviously causes all  the  alike  "TYPES  of  diseases"
            which we  loosely  speak  of  as cancer in the  same  TYPES  of
            tissues regardless of the species involved!

       #10. This information  needs to be put into the hands of responsible
            parties, and we feel that the research specialist in this great
            nation will NOT be led to set  aside  the  old fashioned horse-
            blinders of their own particular fields of research until "we
            the people" have the facts of the matter well in hand.

            Only then they will be forced to do so. In short,  bacteria are
            the hidden cause of many different types of cancers.

            How does  it  all  fit together? The bacteria are involved in a
            manner that  is  similar  to  the  bacteria  involvement  which
            produces TB.

            Every one of the millions of cells which make  up  each  cancer
            have unfolded  from  an infection of the DNA in just ONE SINGLE
            CELL.

            Therefore, NONE of the regular  cancer cell features fall under
            the ordinary   rules  of  bacteriology  but  researchers   have
            traditionally attempting  to  study  them  in  that  manner and
            according to the dictates of that system of logic for decades.

            A second key to understanding  cancers  is in realizing that it
            is the  "ongoing  and  ALIKE actions and relationships  of  the
            cell's regular  metabolic controls" that are lost in every type
            or form of cancer. The exact same aspect of normal cell-to-cell
            communications has always failed.

            The altered  membrane features  obviously  control  the  normal
            coordination of  the  various features of each  cell,  allowing
            cells to operate as a functional whole.

            We find  it  is  the  "regular  orientation of EACH cell's DNA"
            which enables certain tasks to  be carried out and completed in
            a regular  or  stable  manner, and especially  as  involving  a
            tissue's ability  to  order  and/or  properly  restore  its own
            cells.

            There can be no other answer since normal cells can be shown to
            communicate via certain electron  sensitive  membrane  proteins
            which are, in turn, obviously LINKED TO THE COMMON  INFORMATION
            CONTENT of every other cell IN A GIVEN TISSUE.

            Hence, it  is  this  (normally)  functionally  connected system
            which fails when a cell is not  able  (due to the disruption of
            electrical communication by fatty accumulations at the cell

                                      Page 3





            wall junctions) to give the proper indication that is needed to
            verify that it indeed exists.

            The combined  reactions  which  take  place  when  that occurs,
            create the  effects known over  all,  as  cancer.  The  initial
            cancer cell emerges when these key features within  a  cell are
            either masked,   dropped,   or   lost,   due  to  radiation,  a
            carcinogenic agent, or via the introduction of foreign DNA from
            a bacteria.

            Lastly, the fact that cancer  cells  do  not  communicate  with
            their normal cells has been proven by Azarnia  and  Lowenstein,
            through the use of injections of fluorescein.

            The other  reason  behind  a  lack  of  discovery of the cell's
            electron sensitive membrane proteins and their systems of cell-
            to-cell communications is the  fact  that  they  are  evidently
            inactivated and/or quiescent once cells are put into a regular
            laboratory media.
