For years I have been looking for some kind of cure or treatment for diabetes
because I have several friends who suffer greatly from this affliction.

The closest I had come to something that might work was in experiments with
high intensity colored lights, called Chromotherapy, done by Dinshah Ghadiali
in the early 30's.

Dinshah understood that the pancreas NORMALLY produces all the insulin the
body needs.  The test to determine diabetes involves measuring the
concentration of sugar in the blood.  If it is high, the assumption is that
the pancreas is malfunctioning because insufficient quantities of insulin MUST
NOT be present.

The 'cure' is to begin with pills, eventually graduating to injections.  As
you continue to inject more artificial insulin, you literally 'retrain' the
pancreas and cause it to atrophy in its own internal insulin production.  A
form of negative biofeedback.

(I am uncertain as to the correct spin, but I think it is a right handed spin
which is necessary for absorption, so don't count on this anecdote as being
totally factual.)

In nature, everything has a spin, either to the left or to the right.  I
believe it is food which rotates in a right hand direction that can be easily
absorbed by the body.  However, food with a left hand rotation can NOT be
absorbed.  So, the pancreas can apparently accept all ingested sugars and
convert left handed sugar to right handed, thus ensuring a minimum of sugar in
the blood because most of it is NOW right handed and will be absorbed, not
left in the bloodstream to cause confusion.

Dinshah said that the pancreas was malfunctioning in its ability to flip the
rotation of the sugar to a digestible form, and so had to be treated to
restore the ability.  A high intensity colored light was projected on the
pancreas as a treatment.  After the treatment, the majority of sugars were
thereafter properly rotated (to the right instead of the left).

This would allow the body to absorb nearly all the ingested sugars and keep
the blood sugar at normal levels.  Dinshah said it was wrong to inject manmade
insulin into a body just because the blood sugar level was temporarily
measured to be unusually high or low.

Why should the pancreas go to the trouble of producing insulin when it was
being provided from external sources, thus requiring no effort from the body.

As the pancreas is subjected to less and less loading, it eventually atrophies
and the diabetic symptoms progressively worsen as the insulin needs are no
longer partially supplied by the pancreas.  This of course requires more and
more externally supplied insulin.

Thanks to the efforts of Mike Hughes in sharing some wonderful Energy
Unlimited papers, I found an article which CLAIMS to be a cancer, leukemia and
DIABETES cure.

Cancer and Leukemia Cure (alledged)

The inner bark of two South American trees of the Bignoniaceae family is being
used successfully in the treatment of various diseases, including cancer, by
South American physicians.  A brew made with the inner bark of Lapacho Morado
(Tabebuia Altissima) or Lapacho Colorado (Tabebuia Avellanedae) appears to
attack the cause of the disease.

Physicians at the municipal hospital of Santo Andre, a suburb of Sao Paulo,
have noticed that the pain suffered by patients with leukemia or other cancers
disappears within hours after they receive a tea brewed from the inner bark of
Pau D'Arco Roxo.

They have also verified that, within 30 days of treatment with this medicine,
most patients no longer show any cancer symptoms.

         **  Diabetes apparently is cured EVEN FASTER than cancer.  **

Since the early 1960's, this bark has been used regularly at the municipal
hospital there.  Both the herb stores and the 'legitimate' pharmacies in
Brazil now carry this bark.

The red Pau D'Arco, besides eliminating pain, also cures ulcers and rheumatism
and, almost always in less than one month.

Another name for the Lapachos is Ipes, a name used in southern Brazil.  Ipe
roxo is called Pau D'Arco and the red Lapacho is called Pau D'Arco Roxo.  The
red Lapacho is very common in the tropical lowlands.  The Lapacho Morado, or
purple Lapacho, grows in cooler climates like the Andes.

After an article appeared in O Cruzeiro, the physicians at the hospital were
ordered not to make public statements about the hospital's affairs without
prior authorization by the Santo Andre City Council.

The Brazilian Cancer Society was furious about the publicity for the "bark"
cures.  It wanted to forbid the doctors to use the remedy, but the city
fathers of Santo Andre would not agree to that as the bark of the red Pau
D'Arco was saving them a lot of money by CURING PATIENTS and EMPTYING the
hospital.

(It would follow that many people in this part of the world would not have
health insurance and so the hospitals and city government would have to bear
the costs of prolonged cancer treatments or hospital stays, so the faster they
were cured, the less overall cost to the local government.........>>>  Jerry)
