----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 Recently, many unlawfully copied or modified programs have appeared on
various IBM PC bulletin boards across the country.  THE DIRTY DOZEN is a
list of known examples.

 IMPORTANT NOTE: the author takes no responsibility for the validity or
completeness of this list.  Many sources contribute to the list, and it
is very possible that one of the reported 'dirty' files works perfectly
and is in the Public Domain.  I will try to '*' asterisk any programs
what I feel are not positively 'bad,' but all the same, it is quite
possible that a mistake will slip in somewhere.  Since this is the case,
please keep in mind while reading this list that however unlikely, it is
possible that I or my sources are incorrect in our accusations.  Please
also bear in mind that the dirty dozen list has not yet falsely accused
a Public Domain program of being pirated, or a well working program of
all existing bad software into one list.  Everyday users upload bad
software to hundreds of boards, and often times the software is not yet
in this list.  In other words, if you run a trojan horse that I did not
list in here, don't call my board up call up and leave me a message so
that I can get the destructive program in the next issue.  If anyone is
unsure whether a file is trojan, and it's not listed in here, then I
recommend using a utility like BOMBSQAD.COM to prevent any mishaps.

 There are four major categories of bad software: commercial pirate jobs,
unauthorized copies of otherwise legitimate freeware programs, malicious
"TROJAN" programs which damage your system, and miscellaneous illegal
software.  Please look in the definitions section of this document for a
more detailed explanation of these terms.

 SysOps: Please be careful with the files you post in your download
libraries!  An professional quality uploaded game or disk utility should
arouse your suspicions, especially if it doesn't include the author's
name, address, and distribution policy.  Such programs are probably NOT
public domain!  The BBS community is already under legislative threat at
the State and Federal level.  We cannot fight this trend effectively
while our directories sit stocked with cracked Sega games, wargames
dialers, and malicious "trojan horses!"  Let's demonstrate a little
social responsibility by cleaning up our download libraries.  If you as
a SysOp have any of these files on your system, please delete them and
post "blocking" dummy file entries like this one:


        ZAXXON.COM        DELETED!! NOT PUBLIC DOMAIN!!
                           

 If everyone works together to fight this new brand of software, the growing
numbers of piraters and trojan horse writers may well be put 'out of business!'
   
 The idea behind THE DIRTY DOZEN is to bring this important issue to the
attention of more SysOps and users - to act as an information "clearing -
house" for the latest known examples of "bogusware," so that an educated
public can fight effectively for safe downloadable files.
     
  The Dirty Dozen is a big project, and it needs your help to succeed!
Please call in any updates of bad software that you know of, but DO NOT
modify this article yourself.  If everyone who discovers a pirated
program starts modifying the DD, there would be hundreds of issues in
circulation.  Also, I think it's quite unfair, especially considerig that
I've spent over a hundred hours of my time on this list, for just anyone
to put their name at the top of the list and say that they write, or
helped write, the DD.  For example, someone named Gerhard Barth added
two files, both of which were already listed in the DD, and proceeded to
write "Updated by Gerhard Barth, please send all further updates to
Gerhard Barth," etc.  If everyone does this, how will anyone know which
file is the latest and TRUE Dirty Dozen?  If you have an update, please
see the end of this article for information on how to reach me with new
information.

 A user of mine has notified me that some pirates have patched HARDHAT.COM
and PANGO.COM to read "cracked by Eric Newhouse."  This is ridiculous!
Please disregard any programs that you may come across in the future
advertising "copy protection busted by Eric Newhouse, " or the like.
This is just one more way that pirates are trying to get me to stop
publishing this list!

 A word on TROJANS: I have been hearing more and more reports of these
"worm" programs, from all directions.  While I don't doubt their
existence, do not get hysterical.  Remember, a Trojan rumor is much
easier to START than it is to STOP.  Some people have accused legitimate
*joke* programs, like DRAIN (which pretends to be gurgling excess water
out of your A drive) of being "killers." If a program locks up your
system, it isn't necessarily Trojan; it might not like co-residing with
Superkey, or your graphics card.  Ask around a little before you
announce something as Trojan.  I would appreciate a bagged specimen of
any real Trojan program that you might have the (un)luck to find.

 A word on Pirated programs: Recently many pirated programs such as AUTODEX
have been going under many different names.  Although I will try to keep
all these names current in the DD, the best way to check for piracy in 
a file is to run that file yourself -- checking for (C)opyright
notices of commercial manufactures, similarities in looks and operations
of commercial programs, and of course whether the name is in this list.

  Finally I want to thank all BBS SysOps and users that notified me of
updates, additions, and/or corrections to DIRTYDOZ.006.  It's great to
see so much support!  In this issue more people than ever called in with
updates.  Everyone else who reads this list, along with myself, really
appreciates the effort!



DEFINITIONS:


    HACKED    An unlawfully modified copy of an otherwise legitimate
              public domain or user-supported program.  It is illegal to
              distribute a modified copy of someone else's work without
              their permission!  All modified programs must contain this
              permission, either in the program's display or documentation.

    *TROJAN*  BEWARE!! These programs PURPOSEFULLY damage a user's system     
              upon their invokation. Usually they aim to disable hard disks,
              although they can destroy other equipment too.  It is IMPERATIVE
              that you let me know about any new examples of these that you
              find.

    PIRATED   This is an illegal copy of a commercial program product.
              Examples: a cracked (de-protected) game, an accidentally
              or deliberately distributed compiler, editor or utility;
              sometimes a Beta test copy of a program under development,
              handed out by a disgruntled employee or dishonest beta
              tester.  In the latter case, the program in question may
              never make it to market due to the piracy!  In the case of games,
              there's a tendency for the pirate to patch a clumsy
              "PUBLIC DOMAIN" notice over top of the original copyright.
              ZAXXON.COM is a prime example.


    MISC      This is miscellaneous illegal software and/or text.
              The best definition, aside from that, that I can think of
              is that it's NOT pirated software.


NOTE: If I do not supply a file extension, that means that the file circulates
under many different extensions.  For instance, users commonly upload with extensions of either:  .EXE, .COM, .EQE, .CQM, .LBR, .LQR, and .ARC.

ANTI-PCB        *TROJAN*   The story behind this trojan horse is sickening.
                            Apparently one RBBS-PC sysop and one PC-BOARD
                            sysop started feuding about which BBS system
                            is better, and in the end the PC-BOARD sysop
                            wrote a trojan and uploaded it to the rbbs
                            SysOp under ANTI-PCB.COM.  Of course the RBBS-PC
                            SysOp ran it, and that led to quite a few
                            accusations and a big mess in general.  Let's grow
                            up!  Every SysOp has the right to run the type of
                            BBS that they please, and the fact that a SysOp
                            actually wrote a trojan intended for another
                            simply blows my mind.
ARC513.EXE      *TROJAN*   This hacked version of arc appears normal, so
                            beware!  It will write over track 0 of your
                            [hard] disk upon usage, destroying the disk.
ARC514.COM      *TROJAN*   This is totally similar to arc version 5.13 in that
                            it will overwrite track 0 (FAT Table) of your hard
                            disk.  Also, I have yet to see an .EXE version
                            of this program..
BACKTALK        *TROJAN*   This program used to be a good PD utility,
                            but some one changed it to be trojan.
                            Now this program will write/destroy sectors
                            on your [hard] disk drive.  Use this with caution
                            if you acquire it, because it's more than likely
                            that you got a bad copy.
CDIR.COM        *TROJAN*   This program is supposed to give you a color
                            directory of files on disk, but it in fact
                            will scramble your disks FAT table.
DANCERS.BAS     *TROJAN*   This trojan shows some animated dancers in color,
                            and then proceeds to wipe out your [hard] disk's
                            FAT table.  There is another perfectly good copy
                            of DANCERS.BAS on BBS's around the country;
                            apparently the idiot author in question altered
                            a legitimate program to do his dirty work.
DISKSCAN.EXE    *TROJAN*   This was a PC-MAGAZINE program to scan a (hard) disk
                            for bad sectors, but then a joker edited it to
                            WRITE bad sectors.  Also look for this under other
                            names such as SCANBAD.EXE and BADDISK.EXE...
DMASTER         *TROJAN*   This is yet another FAT scrambler..
DOSKNOWS.EXE    *TROJAN*   I'm still tracking this one down -- apparently
                            someone wrote a FAT killer and renamed it
                            DOSKNOWS.EXE, so it would be confused with the
                            real, harmless DOSKNOWS system-status utility.
                            All I know for sure is that the REAL DOSKNOWS.EXE
                            is 5376 bytes long.  If you see something called
                            DOSKNOWS that isn't close to that size, sound the
                            alarm.  More info on this one is welcomed -- a
                            bagged specimen especially.
DPROTECT        *TROJAN*   Apparently someone tampered with the original,
                            legitimate version of DPROTECT and turned
                            it into a FAT table eater.
EGABTR          *TROJAN*   BEWARE! Description says something like
                            "improve your EGA display," but when run it
                            deletes everything in sight and prints "Arf! Arf!
                            Got you!"
EMMCACHE        *TROJAN*   This is a funny trojan.  The author did a good
  V. 1.0                    job of writing the documentation, and on the
                            outside it looks to be a very well written
                            program.  However, after running it to install
                            69 pages of a EMS disk cache, the program
                             A) Scrambled every file that I thereafter modified
                                (changed and then wrote to disk), and
                             B) Destroyed my boot sector.
                            The program is especially dangerous because it
                            will damage many of your most used files before
                            you realize what hit you.
FILER.EXE       *TROJAN*   One SysOp complained a while ago that this program
                            wiped out his 20 Megabyte HD.  I'm not so
                            sure that he was correct and/or telling the
                            truth any more.  I have personally tested an
                            excellent file manager also named FILER.EXE, and
                            it worked perfectly. Also, many other SysOp's
                            have written to tell me that they have like me
                            used a FILER.EXE with no problems.  If you get a
                            program named FILER.EXE, it is probably allright,
                            but better to test it first using some security
                            measures.
FINANCE4.ARC    *TROJAN*   This program is not a verified trojan;
                            there is simply a file going around BBS's
                            warning that it may be trojan.  In any case,
                            execute extreme care with it.
FUTURE.BAS      *TROJAN*   This "program" starts out with a very nice color
                            picture (of what I don't know) and then proceeds
                            to tell you that you should be using your computer
                            for better things than games and graphics.
                            After making that point it trashes your A: drive,
                            B:, C:, D:, and so on until it has erased all
                            drives.  It does not go after the FAT alone,
                            but it also erases all of your data.  As far as I
                            know, however, it erases only one sub-directory
                            tree level deep, thus hard disk users should only
                            be seriously affected if they are in the "root"
                            directory.  I'm not sure about this on either,
                            though.
MAP             *TROJAN*   This is another trojan horse written by the infamous
NOTROJ.COM      *TROJAN*   This "program" is the most sophisticated trojan
                            horse that I've seen to date.  All outward
                            appearances indicate that the program is a useful
                            utility used to FIGHT other trojan horses.
                            Actually, it is a time bomb that erases any hard
                            disk FAT table that IT can find, and at the same
                            time it warns: "another program is attempting a
                            format, can't abort!"  After erasing the FAT(s),
                            NOTROJ then proceeds to start a low level format.
                           One extra thing to note: NOTROJ only damages FULL
                            hard drives; if a hard disk is under 50% filled,
                            this program won't touch it!
                           If you are interested in reading a thorough report
                            on NOTROJ.COM, James H. Coombes has written an
                            excellent text file on the matter named NOTROJ.TXT.
                            If you have trouble finding it, you can get it from
                            my board.
TIRED           *TROJAN*    Another scramble the FAT trojan by Dorn W.
                             Stickle.
TSRMAP          *TROJAN*    This program does what it's supposed to do:
                             give a map outlining the location (in RAM) of
                             all TSR programs, but it also erases the boot
                             sector of drive "C:".
PACKDIR         *TROJAN*   This utility is supposed to "pack" (sort and
                            optimize) the files on a [hard] disk, but
                            apparently it scrambles FAT tables.
QUIKRBBS.COM     *TROJAN*  This Trojan horse advertises that it will
QUIKREF          *TROJAN*  This ARChive contains ARC513.COM.
                            load RBBS-PC's message file into memory
                            2 times faster than normal.  What it really
                            does is copy RBBS-PC.DEF into an ASCII file
                            named HISCORES.DAT...
RCKVIDEO         *TROJAN*  This is another trojan that does what it's supposed
                            to do, then wipes out hard disks.  After showing
                            some simple animation of a rock star ("Madonna," I
                            think), the program will go to work on erasing
                            every file it can lay it's hands on.  After
                            about a minute of this, it will create 3 ascii
                            files that say "You are stupid to download a video
                            about rock stars," or something of the like.
SECRET.BAS       *TROJAN*  BEWARE!! This may be posted with a note saying
                            it doesn't seem to work, and would someone please
                            try it; when you do, it formats your disks.
SIDEWAYS.COM     *TROJAN*  Be careful with this trojan; there is a perfectly
                            legitimate version of SIDEWAYS.EXE circulating. Both
                            the trojan and the good SIDEWAYS advertise that they
                            can print sideways, but SIDEWAYS.COM will trash a
                            [hard] disk's boot sector instead.  The trojan
                            .COM file is about 3 KB, whereas the legitimate
                            .EXE file is about 30 KB large.
STAR.EXE         *TROJAN*  Beware RBBS-PC SysOps!  This file puts some
                            stars on the screen while copying RBBS-PC.DEF
                            to another name that can be downloaded later!
STRIPES.EXE      *TROJAN*  Similar to STAR.EXE, this one draws an American
                            flag (nice touch), while it's busy copying
                            your RBBS-PC.DEF to another file (STRIPES.BQS) so
                            Bozo can log in later, download STRIPES.BQS, and
                            steal all your passwords.  Nice, huh!
TOPDOS           *TROJAN*  This is a simple high level [hard] disk formatter.
VDIR.COM         *TROJAN*  This is a disk killer that Jerry Pournelle wrote
                            about in BYTE Magazine.  I have never seen it,
                            although a responsible friend of mine has.

ARC.COM          HACKED    Someone keeps running SPACEMAKER or a similar EXE
                            squeezer on SEA, Inc.'s ARC archive program, then
                            uploading the resulting COM file to BBS's without
                            the author's permission.  SEA will NOT support the COM version -- this
                            is an unauthorized modification.
AUTOMAXX.ARC     HACKED    This DOS menu-making program comes with
                            documentation that is almost certainly
                            plagiarized.  Marshall Magee, author of the
                            popular AUTOMENU program, contends that the
                            AUTOMAXX documentation uses exact phrases from his
                            documentation, and if this is the case, AUTOMAXX
                            is clearly illegal.  In addition, the
                            executionable file in AUTOMAXX.ARC may also
                            be plagiarized.  For more information, please
                            contact Marshall Magee, at (404) 446-6611.
DOG102A.COM   *  HACKED    Apparently this is a renamed early version of the
 DP102A.ARC                 utility DISKPACK.COM.  One person has reported that it
                            trashed his hard disk that was formatted under
                            DOS 3.1 (2KB clusters).
LIST60           HACKED    Vern Buerg's LIST 5.1, patched to read 6.0.
                           Note:  Mr. Buerg has released a legitimate version
                                  6.0 of LIST.  Every legit. version will have
                                  a letter in the filename (e.g. LIST60H.ARC)
LIST799          HACKED    Vern Buerg's LIST 5.1, patched to read 7.99.
QMDM110.ARC      HACKED    These hacked versions of qmodem are
QMDM110A.ARC               copies of 1.09, patched to read 1.10.  There
                            have been rumors of a worm in 1.10, but I
                            have seen no evidence of it.  Other
                            versions are OK.

                                    seems that this was a poor attempt to damage

|                     MISCELLANEOUS ILLEGAL FILES:                         |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

COPYWRIT         MISC    Patch -- Although the real COPYWRITE is going around
                                   Bulletin Boards like fire, there is another
                                   illegal file under the same name.
                                   The former takes around 40 KB ARC-ed,
                                   whereas this takes about 2 KB.
                                   What I'm referring to is an archive of
                                   1-3 files that explains how to remove
                                   the serial numbers from copywrite. Now
                                   it's allright to "unprotect" a program
                                   for backup purposes, but removing serial
                                   numbers can only lead to piracy.
LOCKPICK         MISC    Text  -- This is a text file, usually with a
                                   .TXT extension, that casually explains
                                   how to pick locks.  I'm not sure
                                   whether this is illegal, but it's
                                   definitely in poor taste.
MONOPOLY         MISC    Game --  The authors of all monopoly
                                  programs are, according to a fairly reliable
                                  source, being sued by Parker Brothers over
                                  copyright infringements.  These files may
                                  become illegal soon, but as of this printing
                                  they are still legal.
MOVBASIC         MISC    Util  -- This highly illegal file breaks IBM copyright
                                  on BASIC and BASICA.  What it does is create
                                  new files called SBASIC or SBASICA that run
                                  "IBM BASIC" on an IBM clone.  Guys, don't
                                  you think that these clones don't run IBM
                                  BASICA for a good reason?  The clones
                                  don't support BASICA because it's illegal!
XTALK            MISC    Patch -- Like Copywrite, there is a patch circulating
                                   BBS's to remove the serial numbers from
                                   Crosstalk.

 This is the end of the "bad files list."  The rest of this document
contains instructions on what to do if YOU run a trojan horse, an update
history, a glossary, and information on how and where to contact me with
updates.








----------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                     If you run a trojan horse..                          |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 While reading this, bear in mind that there is no better remedy for a drive
that has run a trojan horse than a recent backup..

 The first thing to do after running what you think to be a trojan horse is
diagnose the damage.  Was your [hard] drive formatted?  Did the trojan
scramble your FAT table?  Did every file get erased?  Did your boot
sector on the [hard] drive get erased/formatted?  Odds are that the
trojan incurred one of these four disasters..  After the initial
diagnosis, you are ready to remedy the problem.


    1)  If the trojan low-level formatted your [hard] disk:
         Hope that you have a recent backup; that's the only remedy for
         this disease.

    2)  If the trojan high-level formatted your [hard] disk:
         There is only one way out of this mess, and that is to use the
         MACE+ utilities by Paul Mace.  MACE+ has two devices in it to
         recover formatted disks, and believe me, they work!  I will talk
         more about the MACE+ utilities later.

    3)  If the trojan scrambled your FAT table:
         Once again, there is nothing to do.  However, there is a program
         called FATBACK.COM (available on my board) that will back up your
         FAT table in under a minute to floppy.  Using FATBACK, it is easy
         and non time consuming to back up your FAT regularly.

    4)  If the trojan erased file(s), and the FAT table is undamaged:
         There are many packages to undelete deleted files.  Norton
         Utilities, PC-tools, MACE+, and UNDEL.COM will all do the job.
         I recommend the first three, but they are more expensive than
         the Public Domain program UNDEL.COM.  When you are undeleting,
         be sure to undelete files in the order of last time written to
         disk.  I know that PC-tools automatically lists undeletable
         files in the correct order, but the other three may not.

    5)  If the boot sector on your [hard] disk gets erased/formatted:
         There are four things to do if this happens, and the worst that
         can happen is that you will go without a [hard] disk for a while.
         To be on the safest side, back up everything before even proceeding
         to step "A," although I can not see why it would be necessary.

          A)  Try doing a "SYS C:" (or "SYS A:") from your original DOS disk,
              and copy COMMAND.COM back onto the [hard] drive after that.
              Try booting and if that doesn't work try step B.

          B)  If you have the MACE+ utilities go to the "other utilities"
              section and "restore boot sector."  This should do the job
              if you have been using MACE+ correctly.

          C)  If you are still stuck, BACK EVERYTHING UP and proceed to do a
              low level format.  Instructions on how to perform a low-level
              format should come with your [hard] disk controller card.
              Be sure to map out bad sectors using either SCAV.COM by Chris
              Dunford or by manually entering the locations of bad sectors
              into the low level format program.  After the low level format,
              if your have a hard disk, run FDISK.COM (it comes with DOS)
              and create a DOS partition.  Refer to your DOS manual for help
              in using FDISK.  Then put your original DOS diskette in drive A:
              and do a FORMAT <drive letter>:/S/V.  Drive letter can stand for
              "C" or "B" depending on whether you are reformatting a hard disk
              or not.  Finally you are ready to attempt a reboot.

          D)  If you are still stuck, either employ some professional computer
              repairmen to fix your drive, or live with a non-bootable [hard]
              drive..



 By now you may be saying to yourself:


"How can I get a hold of a 'MACE+' utilities package so that I can guard
against trojans?  Why, MACE+ can recover a formatted drive, undelete
files, restore boot sectors, optimize a disk, and provide a disk cache!

 Anyone can obtain these marvelous utilities in one of two ways: one is to
call up the Paul Mace Software Company (tm) and order them at a retail
of $ 79.95.  The other is place an order for them at the WEST LOS
ANGELES PC-STORE, which supports next day UPS shipping!  The BBS phone #
for the PC-STORE is at the end of this document.

|                          Update History:                                 |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Version 1.0   Plans were drawn up for a "bad file" list and a dozen
                   bad files were entered in the list.
    Version 2.0   Saw the addition of a short introduction and 3
                   more files.  All work up to here was done by Tom Neff.
    Version 3.0   Here Tom Neff and I started collaborating on the Dirty
                   Dozen.  22 files were added, and the introduction
                   was completely re-written.  Version 3.0 had a total of
                   37 files.

    Version 4.0   By this time I totally took over responsibility
                   of the DD, as Tom Neff lost interest.  Another 30 or
                   so files were added to the list, making the DD 65+
                   files strong, as well as a few more additions to the
                   introduction.

    Version 5.0   By the time I released version 5.0 to the public, the Dirty Dozen
                   was being greeted favorably and with enthusiasm
                   around the country.  Updates started coming in with
                   regularity; the list prospered (if one can say that
                   about a list!).  A few more paragraphs were added to
                   the introduction, and about 40 new files were bringing
                   the file total up to 103!

    Version 6.0   The Dirty Dozen is now such a big project that
                   I am now writing it in stages.  Although I am going to
                   make absolutely no effort to spread these "intermediate
                   versions," they will always be downloadable from my board.
                   This way if anyone so desires, they may keep an extremely
                   current issue of the DD, although the changes will only be
                   minor.  You might think of stage "a" of issue #6 as version
                   6.1, stage "b" as version 6.2, stage "c" as version 6.3, etc.


                   New in version 6.0 is the following:
                       A) Many minor revisions,
                       B) 17 more files, bringing the total to 120!
                       C) Two new paragraphs in the introduction,
                       D) Instructions on how to recover from a trojan horse,
                       E) A comprehensive glossary,
                       F) This update history,
                       G) An acknowledgments section set up for major
                            contributors of information regarding new bogusware
                       H) A new bogusware catagory of "miscellaneous
                            illegal software."

    Version 6.0a   MOVBASIC.ARC and SBASICA added to the list of illegal files.
                    as well as six Trojan horses have been added to the list.
    Version 6.0c   NOTROJ.COM added to the trojan horse list.
    Version 6.0d   DOG102A.COM added to the hacked files list.
                    HACKED files separated from TROJAN files
    Version 6.0e   DANCERS.BAS added to the trojans list.
    Version 6.0f   4 pirated files added, + NODISK-A and DMASTER to trojans
    Version 6.0g   NODISK-A removed from trojan horse list & placed into pirated
                    programs list.  Monopoly warning issued in misc section.
                    added a few pirated programs. + DPROTECT added as trojan.
    Version 6.0h   EMMCACHE and TIRED added to trojan list, + PEII added.
    Version 6.0i   Added TOPDOS to Trojan list, and AUTOMAXX to HACKED list.
    Version 6.0j   Added QUICKREF to trojans list.  Revised introduction,
                    and added a paragraph to the intro about modifying the DD.
    Version 6.0k   Moved paragraph about 'I'm not responsible for this
                     list' to the front of the file for legal reasons.
                     Also added the '*' convention for HACKED programs.
    Version 6.0l   Added FINANCE4 as a possible trojan.  Added a few glossary
                     definitions.


    Version 7.0    The major changes in this version took place in the
                   revision stages above.  However, I still changed
                   quite a bit in version 7.0 compared to 6.0 revision
                   stage 'L;' for example, I added seventeen new pirated
                   programs, bringing the file total to a whopping 165!
                   Moreover, I rewrote virtually every paragraph in the dirty
                   dozen in order to 'stylize' (clean up the writing in) the
                   document.  Once again I would like to thank all users who
                   called in updates to the Dirty Dozen; those users are the
                   people that encourage me to keep producing the dirty dozen!

?Q?          -- (? standing for any character).  File extension for SQueezed
                files.  Squeezed files are unusable until unsqueezed by a
                utility such as NUSQ.COM or USQ.COM.  The advantage of a
                SQueezed file is that it is  smaller than a regular UnSQueezed
                file, thus saving disk space and download time.  ARChives are
                more efficient than Squeezed files; that's why there are so
                many more ARChives on BBS's these days.  Example of the
                extensions of SQueezed files:  .EQE, .CQM, .LQR, .TQT,
                .DQC, etc.
ABBRV        -- abbreviation for the word: "abbreviation"
ARC          -- File extension for an ARChive file -- many files combined
                together to save space and download time that require ARC.EXE,
                PKXARC.COM, ARCE.COM, or ARCLS.EXE to separate the
                files in to runnable and readable (in the case of
                text) form.
BAS          -- abbrv for "BASIC," as in the programming language
BBS          -- abbrv for "Bulletin Board System"
BBS's        -- abbrv for "Bulletin Board Systems"
BOARD        -- Also "Bulletin Board System"
BOGUSWARE    -- software that is damaging to one or more parties
BOOT or      -- to boot a computer is to restart it from scratch, erasing
REBOOT          all TSR programs.  One reboots by either powering
                off and then back on, or pressing ctrl-alt-del at the same time.
BYTES        -- Bytes measure the length of a file, with one
                byte equaling one character in a file.
CACHE [disk] -- Area of memory set aside to hold recent data.  All programs  
                 then read recent data from that memory rather than from disk.
CLUSTER      -- a phyical block on all [hard] disks, composed of sectors, that
                 holds data.
COM          -- file extension for a file that is executable from DOS level
DD           -- abbrv for "dirty dozen"
DOC          -- abbrv for "documentation"
EMS          -- Enhanced Memory Specification. An EMS card holds 2 MB extra mem.
EXE          -- file extension for a file that is executable from DOS level
HACKED       -- see "definitions" section
HIGH LEVEL
 FORMAT      -- This type of format is what most computer users view as
                a regular DOS-format.  That is, formatting a disk using
                FORMAT.COM (included with DOS) is a high level format.
IBM          -- International Business Machines
IBM OR COMP  -- IBM computer or a 99% or greater IBM Compatible computer
KB           -- Abbreviation for "KiloBytes," one Kb equals 1024 bytes
LBR          -- Extension on Library files.  Library files are really
                many combined files like ARChives, but they require
                different utilities to extract the individual files.
                Some examples of such utilities are LUU.EXE, LUE.EXE,
                LAR.EXE, AND ZIP.EXE.  See "ARC"
LOW LEVEL
 FORMAT      -- This type of format is only executed on a hard disk, therefore
                most hard disk low-level format programs come only with
                a hard disk controller card.  There are a few PD low-level
                formatting packages, though.  Most manufacturers low-level 
                format their hard drives at the factory.  Low level formatting
                is the first step in the three part formatting process; the 
                second step is to use FDISK, and the third is to execute a
                high level format.
MB           -- abbrv for "Megabytes," or "millions of bytes."
MISC         -- abbrv for "miscellaneous"
OPTIMIZE     -- to make all files on a disk "contiguous," or physically linked
                 together on a [hard] drive.
PATCH        -- a file that is patched (combined) into another file
                to change the original file in some way
PD           -- abbrv for "Public Domain"
PIRATED      -- see DEFINITIONS section in this issue.
RAM          -- abbrv for "Random Access Memory."  (memory used by software)
RBBS         -- abbrv for RBBS-PC, a type of BBS (Remote Bulletin Board System)
ROM          -- abbrv for "Read Only Memory." (memory used by hardware to boot)
SYSOP        -- SYStem OPerator of a BBS
*TROJAN*     -- see DEFINITIONS section in this issue.
TROJAN HORSE -- see DEFINITIONS section in this issue.
TSR          -- abbv for "Terminate, Stay Resident" Synonym = "Memory Resident"
TXT          -- abbrv for "text"
USU          -- abbrv for "usually"
UNP          -- abbrv for "unprotect"
UNPROTECT    -- an "unprotect file" is a patch file that results in the
                breaking of copy protection (no doubt for back up purposes).
UTIL         -- abbrv for "utility"
WORM         -- Trojan Horse
ZOO          -- All files compressed with ZOO.EXE bear this file extension.
                 ZOO-compressed files are NOT compatible with ARC.EXE.
