     What is Galactic Net?  
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^              
                   Galactic Net is a *.QWK packet or Fido style message 
                   network. It's primary objective is to link 
                   Sci-Fi / Entertaiment BBS's and their members. 
                   Accomplishing this by way of theme oriented 
                   message conferences. 
                      
     Who can participate in Galactic Net? 
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^               
                   Any BBS Sysop can apply for membership 
                   for his/her BBS, so long as their system supports        
                   a *.QWK packet mail system, or FTSC and offers a *.QWK
                   packet offline mail reader to their members, 
                   However, he/she MUST agree in writing to abide by 
                   Galactic Net operational policies.

     Are there age limits to participation?
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^              
                   At present there are no adult echos. In the event 
                   adult echos are added then the answer is Yes, 
                   participation in Galactic Net ADULT conferences will be 
                   limited to persons at least 18 years of age.
                   It is the individual BBS Sysop's responsibility
                   to insure this requirement is met. Until that time
                   there is no age requirment for carrying the network
                   or using it.
