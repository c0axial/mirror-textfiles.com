 Editor's Welcome
 ----------------

 Thank you very much for taking a look at this month's Pasco BBS Magazine!

 As with all the past August issues of this publication, we have a preview of
 this summer's event put on by ONE, Inc.  Unfortunately, we are no longer
 talking about the ONE BBSCON, as the show's focus has changed and so has its
 name.  In this issue we take a look ahead to the first ONE ISPCON, but not
 before taking a look at the legacy of the ONE BBSCON.  There is also an
 article on some Shareware games scheduled for release this year.  It looks
 like some of today's most popular game developers will be releasing some
 exciting titles in 1996.  There is also an article listing some eighty
 different sites maintained by our Federal government on the Internet's World
 Wide Web.

 Towards the end of this issue are some interesting press releases.  The one
 about the Educational Software Cooperative was forwarded by longtime friend of
 the Pasco BBS Magazine, Clint Bradford.  There is also one from the Electronic
 Frontier Foundation about the verdict in the highly publicized case about the
 Communications Decency Act.  There are also several press releases from the
 Software Publishers Association on a wide range of issues.  I think you will
 find them all interesting reading.  Of course, all our regular features are
 back as well.

 Hope you enjoy this issue and thanks for reading!

 The ONE BBSCON Legacy
 ---------------------

 When ONE, Inc. announced that the first ONE ISPCON would be held this summer,
 it meant that the final ONE BBSCON was held at the Tampa Convention Center
 last August.  Over its four years, the Online Networking Exposition and BBS
 Convention was a wonderful event for on-line operators.  While it was not the
 first bulletin board related event, it certainly was the most successful.  The
 primary factor in that success was the diverse group that gathered each
 August.  All the different BBS software platforms were represented, and the
 attendees featured Sysops from the largest systems in the county and single
 line hobby boards.  While it will be some time until we know how the ONE
 ISPCON will pan out, articles may be written about the legacy of the ONE
 BBSCON.

 First, we should look at the history of the BBSCON.  Jack Rickard, editor of
 Boardwatch Magazine, and Phil Becker, President of eSoft, Inc., formed ONE,
 Inc. (Online Networking Expositions, Incorporated) as a vehicle to host the
 first ONE BBSCON in 1992.  Jack Rickard serves as President of ONE, Inc. and
 Phil Becker is the Secretary/Treasurer.  These two men created the concept of
 the Online Networking Exposition and BBS Convention.  The birth of the ONE
 BBSCON goes back to August of 1991, when the first major BBS related event
 known as FIDOCON91 was held.  Phil Becker has stated, because of the fact that
 FIDOCON91 was being held in his and Rickard's home town of Denver, it was
 "part of what pushed us into doing ONE BBSCON."

 The first ONE BBSCON was held the year after FIDOCON91, from August 13-16,
 1992, at the Stouffer Concourse Hotel in Denver.  There were 950 people at the
 first BBSCON and almost 2,000 attended the show the following year.  ONE
 BBSCON '93 was held from August 25-29, 1993 at The Broadmoor Hotel in suburban
 Colorado Springs.  For the third convention, almost 4,000 people showed up in
 Atlanta.  ONE BBSCON '94 took place August 17-21, 1994 at the Marriott Marquis
 Hotel and the Inforum in downtown Atlanta.  A similar number showed up in
 Tampa from August 16-20, 1995, when the Tampa Convention Center and the Hyatt
 Regency Tampa hosted ONE BBSCON '95.

 The conventions would feature an Opening Session on Thursday morning with some
 of the biggest names in the computer industry addressing the crowd.  Among the
 speakers, Jim Harrer, President of Mustang Software, Tim Stryker, President of
 Galacticomm, Inc. and noted on-line legal expect Lance Rose.  The keynote
 address would conclude that first session and was given by some of the biggest
 names in the computer industry.  This honor was bestowed upon popular computer
 columnist John C. Dvorak, computer pioneer Jim C. Warren, modem technology
 pioneer Dennis C. Hayes and ethernet creator Robert M. Metcalfe.  The BBSCON
 also featured educational sessions, which grew in number from approximately 75
 in 1992 to almost 200 for the 1995 event.  There was similar growth in the
 number of vendors who would display their products on the exhibit floor.  BBS
 software manufacturers, and other vendors, would wait for the BBSCON to
 announce the latest and greatest about their products.

 There were some great educational sessions over the four year history, as the
 biggest names in the on-line industry seemed eager to share their secrets.
 Ward Christensen would talk about the first BBS, John McAfee would discuss
 viruses, Dr. Vinton Cerf spoke about the Internet, Dennis Hayes had a session
 on ISDN, Phil Katz talked about data compression, and the Association of
 Online Professionals was formed at a ONE BBSCON '94 session.  The Jack and
 Phil Show, as in Rickard and Becker, was a popular session put on by the
 convention's organizers.

 Maybe it is too early to really know what the legacy of the BBSCON will be.
 Perhaps, I really cannot explain it.  The BBSCON may be remembered as the last
 days of on-line innocence.  A time when most people did not even know what a
 BBS was.  In time, maybe it will be easier to figure out exactly what legacy
 this wonderful event has left.  Some may say that the legacy is that it proved
 that money could be made with a bulletin board system, or that it moved the
 BBS into the mainstream.  For now, I would like to close with one of my own
 personal recollections of the BBSCON experience.  This is the show's legacy to
 me.

 It is hard not to comment on Tampa Bay area hosting the on-line world last
 August.  That was real special, but it is always tough to top the first time.
 ONE BBSCON '93, at the base of Pike's Peak, surrounded by the majestic beauty
 that inspired the song "God Bless America."  A pleasant and cool evening in
 the thin mountain air.  A crowd of Sysops, just numbering in the hundreds, had
 gathered on the outdoor terrace of the exclusive Broadmoor Hotel.  With a
 classical quartet playing in the background and a modest buffet, it was a
 party in the truest sense of the word.  Drinking, laughing and carrying on
 with people who had a similar devotion to the bulletin board system.  Everyone
 knew what each other was talking about and never once had to explain what a
 BBS was.  It was relaxed, friendly and beyond every expectation.  Few things
 in life are beyond expectations, but that night in Colorado Springs was a
 celebration.  Perhaps, experiences like that are the legacy.

 ONE ISPCON Preview
 ------------------

 The first Online Networking Exposition and Internet Service Providers
 Convention (ONE ISPCON) will take place in San Francisco this August.  The
 event will be held on August 7-10 at the Moscone Center, with the San
 Francisco Hilton and Towers acting as the headquarters hotel.  This article
 gives some background on the show and previews some of the highlights of this
 summer's exhibition.

 The ONE ISPCON has replaced an event known as the ONE BBSCON, which was an
 acroymn for Online Networking Exposition and BBS Convention.  The ONE BBSCON
 was held the last four years before ONE, Inc. decided to change the focus of
 the show.  Jack Rickard and Phil Becker are the primary organizers of the
 show.  Jack Rickard is the publisher of Boardwatch Magazine and acts as the
 President of ONE, Inc.  Phil Becker is the President of eSoft, Inc. and serves
 as the Secretary/Treasurer for ONE, Inc.

 The ONE ISPCON will begin on Wednesday night with the Welcome Reception at the
 San Francisco Hilton's Continental Ballroom.  The following morning's Opening
 Session, at which popular columnist John Dvorak will be the keynote speaker,
 will take place at the Hilton's Grand Ballroom.  Educational sessions, of
 which there are over one hundred planned, will be held at the Hilton and the
 vendor exhibits will take place at the Moscone Center.  The hotel is about
 four blocks from the Moscone Center and there will be shuttle busses between
 the two venues.  Saturday night, the show's final event will be the fifth
 annual John C. Dvorak Awards for Excellence in PC Telecommunications.  The
 awards banquet will be held at the Hilton on .  This is an optional event with
 a cost of $39.

 The vendor exhibits are scheduled for Thursday afternoon and all day Friday
 and Saturday on the floor at Hall C Mascone South.  While a complete list of
 the vendors planning to exhibit was not available, several dozen have
 announced their intentions to attend.  Some of the more familiar names will
 include traditional mainstays Boardwatch Magazine, Boca Research, eSoft, Inc.,
 Giffy Enterprises, Hayes Microcomputer Products, Inc., PKWARE, Inc., Supra
 Corporation and The WELL.

 Upcoming Shareware Game Releases
 --------------------------------

 This article takes a look at some upcoming Shareware game releases scheduled
 for this year.  Epic MegaGames and 3D Realms have announced several new
 titles, and there is the latest from Apogee Software and Accidental Software.
 There is also a quick word on what the folks at id Software are up to.  At
 this time, it is anticipated that these games will be released into the
 Shareware market, however, the developers could decide to go with a purely
 commercial distribution.

 Epic MegaGames expects Jazz Jackrabbit II, the sequel to 1994's Jazz
 Jackrabbit, to be released late this year.  This new version, introducing
 Jazz's neurotic little brother Spaz, will be written for Windows 95.  Things
 may have been peaceful after the first game, as The Rabbit King and Queen
 crowned Jazz a prince and allowed him to marry Princess Eva Earlong.  However,
 when the wedding party is crashed by the evil Devan and his goons, there is a
 wild romp through time.  Devan has been dabbling in magic and intends to go
 back into time to knock off Jazz's hippie parents.  Sounds like the sequel
 will be as much fun as the original Jazz Jackrabbit.

 Epic MegaGames is also planning to release another follow-up to an earlier DOS
 game, Extreme Pinball for Windows 95.  The advantage of this variation will be
 full screen tables allowing players to see all the action on the table at one
 time.  This should be an improvement over the scrolling tables of the DOS
 based classic.  Extreme Pinball for Windows 95 is scheduled for a late summer
 release.

 Unreal is another Windows release by Epic MegaGames, which will run on either
 Windows 95 or Windows NT.  While the theme of the game is not clear from
 Epic's promotional material, they are calling it "more than your average first
 person action game."  The game features dungeons, menacing creatures and a
 hero who will swim and fly.  The game has a 3D environment where monsters and
 players cast shadows, which can often be seen around corners before the source
 is fully revealed.  Unreal could be a significant game and is scheduled for
 release later this year.

 Fire Fight is another Windows 95 game, which is being developed by Chaos Works
 and will be published by Epic MegaGames.  In this mission-based action game,
 the player assumes the role of the number one Phantom pilot, Jax.  Missions
 take players through various environments including forest, snow and jungle
 planets, complete with varying weather and lighting effects.  Fire Fight,
 scheduled for a summer 1996 release, will also be distributed in retail stores
 by Electronic Arts, Inc.

 A couple of other titles from Epic scheduled for release this year are World
 of Wonders and 7th Legion.  World of Wonders is another Windows 95 program and
 is a role-playing adventure game.  This game is being developed by the
 Netherlands based Unicorn Development.  7th Legion is a 3D action-strategy
 game and had the working title of War Machine.  Players construct and control
 powerful armies and weapons, including giant robots, to engage in battle.

 Apogee Software's 3D Realms Entertainment division has several new games
 expected to be released during 1996, but with no firm release dates.  3D
 Realms calls their upcoming release of Blood for Blood "a long, dark journey
 into madness."  The objective is to reach the Dark Domain and stop the evil
 Tchernobog, but you will have to make your way through fortresses, castles,
 mines, mansions, and estates before reaching that goal.  Along the way you
 will encounter rats, bats, spiders, eels, zombies, cultists, gargoyles,
 hellhounds, and other nasty creatures.  This 3D game features sloped or
 slanted floors and ceilings, game characters that cast shadows and multi-
 player features.

 3D Realms will also release a game called Shadow Warrior.  The player assumes
 the role of a highly trained Ninja who must stop a crazed cult of demon
 worshipers.  Some the weapons at your disposal include throwing stars, swords,
 crossbows, uzi machine guns and a variety of spells.  The promotion material
 explains something that might happen in a multi-player game:  "A player that
 is killed violently might have his head explode off and land on the ground--
 and the other players can kick it around--soccer anyone?  The whole time the
 dead player still sees through the eyes and can even vomit back at the live
 players."

 Another upcoming title by 3D Realms is called Prey.  In this 3D game, the
 player is abducted by aliens and taken to a dark world where they are hunted
 without mercy.  Prey will be released for Windows 95 and DOS, then other
 platforms.  It will be released first as Shareware and a retail version will
 follow.

 Apogee Software has released information on a new game called HiSpeed, which
 will be published under the Apogee label "When it's done."  HiSpeed is an
 overhead view 3D racing game where you need to finish in the top three places
 to buy new engines, tires, and better cars to enter the faster races.  There
 is also a combat option, and an underground market to buy armor, spikes and
 other surprises your opponents will not like.  Sounds like HiSpeed will be
 fun.

 Accidental Software has announced they will soon release the Ultimate Tarot
 Counselor.  In this program, an animated Tarot Counselor answers your
 questions with specific interpretations, teaches you the terminology,
 symbolism, and meanings of the cards, and prints your readings.  Accidental
 Software is best known for a series of casino related Shareware games.

 id Software has recently released their highly anticipated game Quake.  They
 are currently working on converting previous releases, primarily Doom and
 Hexen, to various other platforms and plan an "id Anthology."  The company
 also plans a line of clothing called "idwear."  id Software is working with
 Universal Pictures to create a movie based on Doom and PocketBooks to produce
 a series of books on the popular game.

 Computer Basics
 ---------------

 Written by Ed Garwood, Hudson, FL

 Making a Boot Disk

 At a recent computer club meeting, I spoke  about the need to make a "Boot
 Disk," to be used in case your computer failed to 'Boot-Up.'  I had noticed
 several people making notes, causing me to think that writing the procedure
 out might be of assistance.

 A Boot Disk is just an ordinary disk with the files IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS, and
 COMMAND.COM on it.  These are the three files your computer needs to start
 operation properly.  To make one, do the following:

 1.  Put a GOOD blank disk in your A Drive and bring up the A:> prompt.

 2.  Type FORMAT A: /S. (NOTE: if using a 5¬" 360k disk, type FORMAT A:/4/s ).

 You will be prompted to put a disk in the A Drive.  Since you have already
 done that, just press ENTER.  The A drive light will go on and you will see a
 the following messages:

 Formatting Drive  A
 Format Complete
 System Transferred
 Volume Label (just type BOOT DISK)
 Format Another (y/n) (Type  N)

 3.  Your boot disk is now ready.  To see what files are there, just type
 DIR A:/a.  You will see the following:

 IO.SYS
 MSDOS.SYS
 COMMAND.COM

 NOTE:  If you typed DIR A: (without the /a, you would not see the first two
 files listed, because they are "Hidden Files."  The addition of /a causes them
 to be listed.

 4.  Although your boot disk is complete, you would do well to add two more
 files to it.  Leave the disk in the A: drive, and switch to the  C:> prompt.
 (To do so, just type C:)

 5.  Now, type COPY AUTOEXEC.BAT A:

 6.  Then type COPY CONFIG.SYS A:

 These two commands will copy these two files to your boot disk, so your
 computer will start as before.  Type DIR A:/a, and you'll see these two files
 have been added to the list.

 8.  Remove the disk from the drive, and label it as your Boot Disk.  Put the
 date on it and put it in a safe place.  If, at some future date, your computer
 will not boot up, put this disk in the A: drive and try to re-boot your
 computer.  If the problem was a minor one chances are your computer will now
 start up with out any trouble.

 Making a Boot Disk (Windows Version, that is)

 For those who must use Windows, let's make a boot disk using Windows.  Put a
 GOOD blank disk in your A Drive.  In Windows, bring up File Manager.  Click on
 A (A drive), and then click on Disk.  In the DISK window, click  on "Make
 System  Disk".  When Windows has finished installing system files (when the A
 Drive light goes out), click on C Highlight the C:\ in the left directory, and
 then click on AUTOEXEC.BAT, which will now be highlighted.  Click on File, and
 in the File box, click on Copy.  In the COPY window, after TO:, type A:.  Now
 click on OK and the AUTOEXEC.BAT file will be copied to your new boot disk.
 Repeat by clicking on CONFIG.SYS, and copy it to your new boot disk.  Now
 click on A, and you should see the following files listed:

 IO.SYS
 MSDOS.SYS
 COMMAND.COM
 AUTOEXEC.BAT
 CONFIG.SYS

 If these 5 files are displayed in the directory, you have done the job
 correctly, and you now have a boot disk.  Label it as such, together with the
 date, and put it away in a safe place for possible future use.

 Violence in Computer Games
 --------------------------

 Written by Paul Pollack, New Port Richey, FL
 Edited by Alex Thomas, New Port Richey, FL

 The St. Petersburg Times recently took a poll in the X-Press section, a
 section read almost entirely by kids.  They asked the question, "Do you think
 you or your friends could be harmed by the things you read or hear?"  Out of
 879 respondents, 362 (approximately  41%) thought that they could be harmed by
 the things they read or hear, but the other 517 respondents (approximately
 59%) said that they could not be influenced by these things.  Besides backing
 up the claim I made in a previous article about kids not feeling it affects
 their behavior, this raises some important questions of its own.  Are these
 kids right?

 I personally cannot answer this question because there is no real answer, but
 I feel it might have at least some impact on behavior.  Then again, there's
 the other extreme that wants to have Sesame Street, Barney, and even Bugs
 Bunny off the air because of the acts of violence.  This is hogwash!  Nobody
 is going to listen to Elmer Fudd trying to shoot off Bugs Bunny's head, and
 then buy a gun to shoot off their own or somebody else's!  Getting back to the
 subject, I feel that we also need to ask ourselves whether or not the oncoming
 advance of graphic realism will effect violence in video games.

 Games and their graphics have continued to evolve, from CGA to EGA to VGA and
 now to Super VGA.  Game manufacturers have also learned how to better harness
 the capabilities of the cards, e.g. Eye of the Beholder -> Wolfenstein 3D ->
 Doom -> The 7th Guest -> Under a Killing moon.  Already we have games released
 that are to many, "excessively violent."  Look at Wolfenstein, look at Doom,
 look at The 7th Guest which actually shows a baby being strangled.  These
 games are no doubt, violent, but each case has to be decided on it's own
 merits.

 Look at Wolfenstein and Doom, both involve killing people, but in each the
 killing is "justified."  In Wolfenstein you're killing the Nazis, who, in my
 opinion, deserve to die.  Does this justify their killing?  Who knows, and by
 whose standards can this be judged?  What about Doom?  In Doom you're killing
 mutant soldiers out to kill you.  The graphic realism in this game is also
 stunning, which makes the gore even worse.  Is this killing justified?  Again,
 who can tell?  According to the courts, you have a right to kill if you feel
 your life is in danger, and it's self defense.  So, I guess in these
 situations, if the people in the games were real, the courts would find it
 justified.  Still, do you really want to glorify violence in front of a large
 audience which may include young children?  Now we move on to The 7th Guest,
 or T7G as I'll call it while discussing it now.  As mentioned earlier, T7G has
 a picture of a baby being strangled?  Is really necessary to glorify violence
 to this extent?  As with Night Trap, I've never really played the game, so I
 can't really judge it.

 As a whole, violence is a complex issue.  But simply blaming it on violence in
 video games or other forms of entertainment is just an oversimplification.
 Sure this is a major problem in society today, but they should consider other
 causes of violence also, such as parent neglect, peer pressure, etc.

 Alex says:

 First of all, I didn't add any extra comments to his article, because I wanted
 to write this.  Following up on Paul's paragraphs, I think, if a parent
 doesn't want their kid to play these games:  they shouldn't let 'em!  When I
 play Mortal Kombat, I hardly notice the blood unless I'm looking!  One time I
 played just to watch the blood fly, and the fatalities abound.  After playing,
 did I feel like pulling someone's head off of their neck?  I don't think so.
 Another thing I'd like to address while we're on the subject.  My friend has a
 Sega Genesis.  He's not allowed to buy or play Street Fighter II Special
 Champions Edition, because his parents object to the fact that there IS
 "funny" blood, and also because you have to beat up a girl (Chun Li).  Then
 there is the other group of people that won't play SFII because they think
 it's sexist to have ONLY one girl in it.  Capcom (the publishers of this game)
 are in a no-win situation.

 Logic Review
 ------------

 Andreau Epple has written a strategy game called Logic, which is being
 distributed as Shareware by HomeBrew Software.  Version 1.0 was the basis for
 this review.

 The program's documentation calls Logic "an action puzzle game."  The game is
 based on placing stones on a grid, however, the concept is not adequately
 explained within the program.  The documentation states, "There are four
 Logics made of various types of stones.  The Logics grow and the aim is to
 keep them down long enough to complete each level."  There is no on-line help
 explaining the game, and you have to look at the README file to find out that
 the Q key is used to exit the program.  On the positive side, the program does
 feature a colorful interface and has sound card support.

 The Vacaville, California based HomeBrew Software has been around since 1992,
 so maybe subsequent versions of Logic will be more user friendly.  The mouse
 interface is really quite nice, but that same interface should be used to exit
 the program.  The game should also be explained more fully on-line.  A
 programmer should not expect people to read the documentation, as it just does
 not happen.  In the highly competitive Shareware market, little things can
 make the difference.

 Windows 95 - Is It For You?  Is It For Anyone?  (c)1995 Louis Illes

 Having unilaterally declared all other operating systems obsolete, Microsoft
 has now cornered the market on proprietary software since they forgot how mad
 everyone got at USR for their proprietary hardware.  Do you have a program
 that won't run in WIN95?  Then there's something wrong with that program M$
 tech support will tell you.

 Aside from an inability to run certain DOS programs, WIN95 requires a Pentium
 unless you have time to run out and learn Latin while Windows loads.  Yes,
 with WIN95, you can experience all the stress of using an XT without actually
 having one.

 And if you enjoy solving seemingly insurmountable hardware conflicts, then
 you'll love WIN95.  Especially when you discover that your brand new Pentium
 needs a brand new BIOS to work properly.  (The word "properly" is used loosely
 to mean "works like it used to.")

 I've tried WIN95 and discovered that I much prefer a poke in the eye with a
 sharp stick.  I'd suggest that before anyone upgrades to WIN95, they take a
 couple of hits on the head with a clue stick.

 And now for the WIN95 quiz:

 1. Do you consider M$ tech support people:
    (a) competent?
    (b) unavailable?
    (c) close personal friends at this point in your life?

 2. Do you believe Bill Gates is:
    (a) a genius?
    (b) a lucky bastard?
    (c) holding your bank account hostage?

 3. If you could go back in time, would you:
    (a) stick with DOS 6 and WIN3.1?
    (b) switch to OS/2?
    (c) never have upgraded from your first pocket calculator?

 4. When people mention WIN95, do you:
    (a) say "It's new so it must be good"?
    (b) roll your eyes and say "I'm waiting for the bugs to be worked out of
        it"?
    (c) roll your eyes and babble incoherently about comport conflicts, hostage
        IRQs, and where the hell did those cute little icons you spent years
        arranging on your desktop go to anyway?

 PBM Flashback - August 1993
 ---------------------------

 Pasco County resident, and popular BBS utility author, Brent Yandell was
 featured in an exclusive interview in the August 1993 issue of the Pasco BBS
 Magazine.  He shared his thoughts on a wide range of issues.  Here is some of
 what he had to say about Shareware in general.

 "There are certainly some people making a really good living off some
 Shareware products.  Starting back with Marshall McGee and AutoMenu, there are
 some great business applications out there that these fellows are making some
 real serious money on.  There are some people with games who have done really
 well.  There is a magazine out called Shareware, I think it is a bimonthly,
 but you can just tell by reading this, some of these people have done really
 well.  Would I recommend it?  If you have a really hot product and you don't
 want to try to sell it to a big company, it's certainly a great way to go."

 Editor's Note:  PBM Flashback will appear on a regular basis in future issues.
 Each issue will have this brief look back at some of the features which have
 appeared over the history of the Pasco BBS Magazine.

 Letter Attack Review
 --------------------

 Letter Attack is a Shareware program designed to make learning to type fun and
 easy.  The educational game is not graphically intense and is fairly similar
 to many typing tutor games found in the on-line world.

 The program's description files explain the premise of the game.  "An arcade-
 style typing tutor in which the player must defend the planet from the aliens.
 Words and letters flash across the screen and must be typed correctly to be
 eliminated.  Includes a practice section to show correct finger placement."
 Letter Attack does offer varying degrees of difficulty, which pertains to the
 speed that the letters drop.

 Letter Attack was first released in 1992, when the program's author was
 fifteen years old.  The most recent release is version 2.7, which has a
 registration fee of $11.50.

 EFF Press Release
 -----------------

 Federal Court Rules Communications Decency Act Unconstitutional

 Philadelphia -- "Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos, so the
 strength of our liberty depends upon the chaos and cacophony of the unfettered
 speech the First Amendment protects.  "With these ringing words, a
 Philadelphia federal court has struck down a law today that would have
 criminalized constitutionally protected speech on the Internet and other
 online forums.  In what civil libertarians are hailing as a victory for
 everyone who uses computer communications, a three-judge panel in
 Philadelphia's federal court ruled in a unanimous decision that the
 controversial "Communications Decency Act" (CDA) violates the U.S.
 constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and of the press.

 "First of all, we are pleased to see the court vindicate our vision of the Net
 as a medium protected by the First Amendment," said Lori Fena, executive
 director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a watchdog group
 established to protect civil liberties, and promote responsibility, in
 computer communications.  "Secondly, we are delighted that the court has gone
 beyond striking down the law, and has stated positively what constitutional
 principles must govern any attempt to regulate the most democratic mass medium
 the world has ever seen."  Said EFF Chairman Esther Dyson:  "This is a day for
 individual citizens, for families, and for public and private organizations
 online to celebrate."

 "The judges recognized that CDA was a wholly inappropriate exercise of
 governmental power under the Constitution," said Mike Godwin, EFF staff
 counsel.  "The law would have abridged one of the freedoms that Americans
 treasure most, and a freedom that is central to any democratic society," he
 said.  Godwin applauded the members of the coalition that challenged the law
 in federal court.  "We and the other plaintiffs persuaded them that the
 government cannot constitutionally impose this sort of overreaching, and
 duplicative regulation of content in the online world," Godwin said.  Dyson
 stated that the decision stands for one of EFF's principal positions regarding
 free speech online: "We believe in free speech at the source -- and in the
 empowerment of any audience for that speech to control what they see."

 "This decision takes the responsibility for controlling and accessing speech
 on the Net out of the hands of government and puts it back in the hands of
 parents and other individuals where it belongs," she said.  "Individuals
 already have the technical means to make their own choices about what they and
 their children read and see," Dyson said.  Godwin noted that existing anti-
 obscenity laws, together with low-cost technological solutions, offer a more
 efficient, less intrusive answer to questions about protecting children in the
 online world. "The government kept saying that this was a crisis that required
 harsher censorship in the online world than in any other communications
 medium," Godwin said.  "In fact, we showed that it's possible to promote both
 freedom of speech and family values -- that the two goals don't oppose each
 other.

 "While the plaintiffs are pleased with the victory, Fena said, "it's no time
 to be complacent."  A collection of poorly drafted state laws has followed in
 the wake of the passage of the CDA, and the issues these statutes raise must
 be addressed as well, she said.  "What's as compelling as the language of this
 decision," Godwin said, "is the breadth of the opposition to this
 legislation,"  He noted that two large groups of plaintiffs, including EFF,
 the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Privacy Information Center,
 People for the American Way, the American Library Association, Microsoft, and
 Apple Computer, had challenged the recently passed law in Philadelphia's
 federal court.  Even Administration officials have privately and publicly
 voiced their concerns.

 The plaintiffs must now prepare for the government's planned appeal to the
 United States Supreme Court, Godwin said, citing a provision of the
 Telecommunications Reform Act of 1996, which prescribes such a direct appeal
 when a provision of the telecom act is found unconstitutional in a lower
 court.  Godwin also commented that "this may be the most rapidly distributed
 federal court opinion in American history."  Sites all over the over the Net
 would be carrying the full text of the opinion almost as soon as the judges
 hand it down, he said, noting that the court is providing copies of the
 opinion on computer diskettes as well as through more traditional means.

 The constitutional challenge to the Communications Decency Act has been
 grounded in four basic arguments --that the law is unconstitutionally over
 broad (criminalizing protected speech), that it is unconstitutionally vague
 (making it difficult for individuals and organizations to comply), that it
 fails what the judiciary calls the "least restrictive means" test for speech
 regulation, and that there is no basic constitutional authority under the
 First Amendment to engage in this type of content regulation in any
 nonbroadcast medium.  "We are confident the Supreme Court will uphold the
 Philadelphia court's decision,"  Godwin said.

 SPA Press Releases
 ------------------

 > SPA Sues Six U.S. Software Rental Companies

 February 28, 1996, Washington, D.C.  - The Software Publishers Association
 (SPA) filed six lawsuits today alleging the unauthorized rental of SPA member
 software.  The suits allege each of the defendants rented copies of computer
 software without authorization from the copyright owner for a specified term
 of days, in exchange for the payment of a fraction of each computer program's
 selling price.  Since the passage of the Computer Software Rental Act of 1990,
 it has been illegal to rent software without the copyright owner's specific
 permission.

 Suits were filed in five different cities across the United States.  The
 defendants in these actions are View Plus Software, Brea, Calif.; Software
 Exchange, Fayetteville, N.C.; Software Pipeline, Portland, Ore; Star Tek
 Software and Video Games and Access Gaming and Computing, Austin, Texas; and
 Software Hogs, Virginia Beach, Va.  The lawsuits involved SPA members Adobe
 Systems, Broderbund Software, Claris, Corel Systems, Datastorm Technologies,
 IBM Corp., Intuit, Novell, Software Publishing Corp. and Symantec Corp.

 "It doesn't matter whether the transaction is called 'rental,' 'buy-back,'
 'try before you buy,' 'preview,' 'evaluation' or any similar term.  If the
 software dealer does not have written permission from the copyright holders to
 rent software, it is illegal to do so," said Sandra Sellers, SPA vice
 president of intellectual property education and enforcement.  "These suits
 were brought simultaneously throughout the United States to demonstrate that
 unauthorized rental is a nationwide problem.

 "Indeed, this illegal behavior is pervasive throughout North America," Sellers
 continued.  SPA recently settled five lawsuits against Canadian software
 dealers who rented software without authorization, which is also illegal under
 the Canadian Copyright Act.  Another Canadian suit is pending, and other
 investigations are ongoing.

 "The suits in both the United States and Canada send a message to the industry
 and the public that the rental provisions of copyright laws will be enforced,"
 Sellers said.  The cases filed today represent SPA's second round of lawsuits
 against U.S. companies renting software without authorization.  In March 1995,
 SPA member companies received a permanent injunction and $150,000 judgment
 against Global Software & Accessories Inc., of Long Island, N.Y.

 SPA initiated investigations into these and other rental organizations after
 receiving tips from the rental stores' customers on SPA's anti-piracy hotline,
 (800) 388-7478, or World Wide Web site, piracy@spa.org and from SPA members.
 Investigators visited each store at least two times posing as customers and
 found each store was regularly renting computer software.  Based on complaints
 and the investigators' reports, SPA filed suit.

 "Software rentals were prohibited to inhibit the distribution of unauthorized
 copies.  Consumers should recognize if the software is not from an authorized
 source, there is the risk of getting a computer virus or non functioning or
 incompatible software," explained Peter Beruk, SPA director of domestic anti-
 piracy.  "And since the software is not authorized, there is no technical
 support or useful documentation to solve problems created by using
 unauthorized software.  It's a case of 'you get what you pay for,' or even
 worse, 'more than you bargained for.'"

 SPA's focus is on companies developing and publishing software applications
 and interactive content.  SPA is the leading trade association of the desktop
 software industry, representing the leading publishers as well as many start-
 up firms in the business, consumer and education markets.  Its 1,200 members
 account for 90 percent of the sales of the U.S. packaged software industry.
 SPA is an international organization with offices both in the United States
 and Europe.  SPA press releases are also available through fax-on-demand at

 > 1996 Codie Award Winners

 March 5, 1996, San Francisco, CA - The Software Publishers Association's 11th
 Annual SPA Excellence in Software Awards (the Codie Awards) were presented at
 a black-tie gala yesterday.  The big winner was Netscape Communications Corp.,
 the maker of the most popular "surfing" tool for the World Wide Web, with four
 awards and a SPA Lifetime Achievement Award for its President and Founder Jim
 Clark.  Theatrix Interactive, a newcomer in home creativity and learning
 products, also excelled by taking home three of the coveted trophies.

 "SPA worked very hard to incorporate new categories that reflect the ever-
 changing software industry," said Ken Wasch, President of SPA.  "The winners
 of the new multimedia, upgrade and online categories illustrate the innovation
 and creativity in the software products available to consumers today."

 All product award winners were selected during a three phase nomination
 process.  More than 350 software publishers nominated products released by
 their companies in 1995.  More than 100 software reviewers from media outlets
 such as the Today Show, Business Week,  National Public Radio, CBS Radio, the
 Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, PC Magazine, CD ROM Today, ranked the
 nominees in order of preference to whittle down the impressive list to the
 five best in each category.  Final ballots were submitted by SPA members to
 determine the Codie award winner in each category.

 > SPA Increased Action Against Software Pirates in 1995

 March 14, 1996, Washington, D.C. - The Software Publishers Association's (SPA)
 continuing effort to crack down on software piracy worldwide achieved a record
 level of success in 1995.  SPA took action against 586 organizations in the
 United States, an increase of 23 percent over 1994.  The lawsuits and audits
 brought by SPA in the United States against software pirates in 1995 netted
 $2.6 million in penalties, bringing SPA's total piracy campaign receipts to
 more than $16 million since the program started in 1990.  Additionally, SPA
 doubled the number of lawsuits brought outside the United States in the
 previous year.

 Domestically, calls to SPA's anti-piracy hotline, (800) 388-7478, increased by
 24 percent from 1994 to 1995.  Based on these reports, SPA filed lawsuits or
 conducted audits on 185 organizations, six of which resulted in settlements
 greater than $100, 000, an increase of 17 percent over the previous year.
 Monies collected are used to fund an extensive international anti-piracy
 program, educational materials, investigations and litigation.  Anti-piracy
 information is also available on the World Wide Web (http://www.spa.org).
 Many people use SPA as a resource to obtain information about the legal use of
 software, others to report instances of piracy.

 "During 1995, SPA began to change fundamentally the worldwide perception that
 stealing intellectual property is acceptable," said Sandra A. Sellers, vice
 president of intellectual property education and enforcement.  "With the
 recent hiring of two experienced attorneys and others to create teams to fight
 piracy in Asia/Pacific and Latin America, we will redouble our education and
 enforcement efforts in 1996 to spread this message throughout the world.  SPA
 has increased its anti-piracy staff by 50 percent to meet the growing
 challenge to reduce the level of worldwide software piracy, estimated at more
 than $8 billion dollars in 1994."

 The new staff will concentrate on broadening SPA's educational efforts and
 further developing SPA's international anti-piracy enforcement program.  SPA's
 coverage in Asia/Pacific will expand to include Japan, Hong Kong, China,
 Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia,
 Indonesia and India.  In Latin America, SPA will focus primarily on Mexico,
 Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela and Chile.

 On the educational front, in 1995 SPA gave its Certified Software Manager
 (CSM) course in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany,
 Israel, Japan, Mexico and Colombia.  In the first half of 1996, the software
 asset management seminar will also be offered in Singapore, China, India and
 15 additional Latin American countries.  Plans are also underway to offer the
 course in late 1996 in Russia, Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong.

 SPA continues to expand its educational tools to teach the public how to use
 software legally.  SPA just released a new video, "It Could Have Been So
 Easy," designed for the corporate world and will soon release another video,
 "A Shared Set of Values," for the higher education community.  These videos
 join SPAudit, KeyAudit, the Software Management Guide and other SPA materials,
 to create a strong public awareness program.

 > SPA, Singapore Police Force and AACT Raid Vans Carrying Pirated Software

 March 27, 1996, Singapore - Police seized 5,800 CD-ROMs, valued at over
 US$700,000, from two vans on Monday.  The seizure is believed to be the
 largest for pirated programs in Singapore and is the result of several months
 of independent investigation and surveillance by the Software Publishers
 Association (SPA) and the Alliance Against CD-ROM Theft (AACT).  The Singapore
 Police Force arrested the two van drivers, who will be charged in court on
 Wednesday.  The police also raided three outlets in two Singapore shopping
 centers reputed to contain heavy concentrations of pirate retailers.

 Led by SPA and AACT investigators, the police struck just as the van drivers
 returned to their vehicles after delivering software programs to a computer
 retail outlet.  In the past, retailers of pirated programs stored the
 infringing copies within their premises.  However, due to the number of raids
 conducted separately by SPA on retail outlets, infringers have become more
 wary and have taken to using moving stores such as the vans.

 This action is the beginning of expanded anti-piracy activities by SPA in the
 Asia/Pacific region.  SPA plans to expand its anti-piracy program, including
 education and enforcement activities, to 12 Pacific rim countries by the end
 of 1996.

 To find out more about software piracy, order educational materials or report
 suspected software piracy, call SPA's U.S. hotline at (800) 388-7478 or the
 Singapore helpline number at (800) 337-6400.

 > Settlement Announced In Copyright Infringement Case

 May 16, 1996 Washington, D.C. - A Florida-based private junior college,
 International Fine Arts College Inc., paid $135,000 to settle a lawsuit
 alleging copyright infringement filed against it on March 1 in Miami.  The
 complaint alleged that International Fine Arts College had unlawfully
 duplicated computer programs published by Adobe Systems Inc., Novell Inc. and
 Quark Inc.  The court issued an ex-parte temp orary restraining order ("TRO")
 one week later, which allowed the plaintiffs' representatives, accompanied by
 deputy United States marshals, to audit the computer programs installed on the
 defendant's computers.  The lawsuit was based on an investigation conducted by
 the Software Publishers Association (SPA) following a call to SPA's anti-
 piracy hotline, (800) 388-7478.

 Edward Porter, president of the college, stated he had no knowledge of the
 practices alleged and has issued a firm policy warning the college's employees
 about the importance of complying with copyright laws.  "The college is today
 in complete and full compliance with all copyright laws," Porter said.

 U.S. law prohibits the unauthorized duplication of computer programs.  In
 announcing the settlement, Sandra Sellers, SPA Vice President of Intellectual
 Property Enforcement and Education, said, "U.S. companies continue to
 duplicate and use software illegally.  Indeed, since January 1996, SPA has
 settled four matters for over $100,000 each, including SPA's largest single
 settlement of $500,000.  This lawsuit and the resulting settlement should send
 a message to other organizations that software piracy will not be tolerated by
 SPA on behalf of its 1,200 members.  We hope these actions will convince other
 organizations to take advantage of the many resources offered by SPA, namely
 SPAudit, SPA's self-audit kit, the Certified Software Manager (CSM) course and
 our newest corporate educational video, It Could Have Been So Easy.'"

 > Hong Kong Software Pirates Arrested

 June 4, 1996 Washington, D.C. - Hong Kong Customs officers arrested two
 suspected software pirate vendors in Hong Kong on Wednesday, May 22, 1996, and
 seized 20 CD-ROMs, each containing software with an estimated total retail
 value of US$20,000 along with the equipment capable of reproducing the pirate
 CDs.  This was a direct result of several months investigation and
 surveillance by the Software Publishers Association (SPA), the leading trade
 association for the personal computer software industry, which has begun an
 active enforcement program in Hong Kong.

 One vendor had allegedly been advertising via fax to various companies.
 Customs officials then arrested the accomplice who worked for an Internet
 provider company.  Customs officers seized the computer, a CPU server and a
 CD-ROM drive,  which they believed to be the instruments for making the
 infringing CD-ROMs.

 SPA acted against this open infringement to protect its members, such as
 Adobe, Claris and Apple, in the Hong Kong case.  Greg Wrenn, corporate counsel
 for Adobe Systems Inc., said, "Piracy is a serious problem for Adobe, our
 local distributors and resellers and the worldwide software industry.  Adobe
 appreciates the hard work and time spent in this investigation by the SPA and
 Hong Kong Customs officers and is very pleased with the arrests.  SPA's
 increasing activities in Asia/Pacific should be a significant deterrent to
 such software piracy."

 SPA's director for Asia/Pacific anti-piracy, Elisha Lawrence, said the arrest
 is another step in an expanded anti-piracy program by SPA in the territory,
 where the largest number of complaints of infringement has been recorded.  SPA
 has significantly expanded its anti-piracy activities in the Asia/Pacific
 region, including both education and enforcement.  In 1994, the software
 industry suffered an estimated US$8 billion losses to worldwide software
 piracy.
