 Editor's Welcome
 ----------------
 
 Welcome to the latest issue of Tampa Bay's oldest free on-line magazine!

 In this issue, we feature some coverage of the first ONE ISPCON.  After going
 to the last three BBSCONs, I did not attend the event myself.  There are some
 interesting details emerging.  Considering that less than 2,000 people went to
 the show, it could be said that the change in focus was a mistake.  When Tampa
 hosted the last ONE BBSCON in the summer of 1995, event organizers were
 speculating that around 10,000 people would attend the 1996 show in San
 Francisco.  After those estimates were given, the organizers changed the name
 of the event from the ONE BBSCON to the ONE ISPCON.  The focus would move from
 the bulletin board system to Internet service providers.  Toss in the fact
 that the registration fees went up dramatically, and it could be said that the
 first ONE ISPCON was a failure.  Boardwatch Magazine editor Jack Rickard, one
 of the primary sponsors of the ISPCON, put his own spin on this year's show.
 Traditionally, Boardwatch Magazine has taken on a cheerleader role, instead of
 reporting any real news on the event.  It is comical to see Rickard call it
 the "Largest gathering of ISPs ever held."  I would think that they are
 disappointed with the turnout, but also believe that they will never admit
 they made a mistake.  So, that is my two cents worth on this subject.

 This month also takes a look at Olsen Outdoors.  I always thought Dick Olsen
 would make an interesting interview for this publication, and it is possible
 that will be pursued for a future issue.  He has combined two interesting
 hobbies, computers and fishing, and has an entire line of fishing related
 Shareware programs.  There is also part one of a two part article on the
 Copyright Law.  From time to time we like to present laws which are pertinent
 to the on-line world.  Of course, all our regular features are back as well,
 including Ed Garwood's Computer Basics.

 Thanks for reading!

 ONE ISPCON '96 Highlights
 -------------------------

 The first Online Networking Exposition and Internet Service Providers
 Convention (ONE ISPCON) was held in San Francisco August 7-10, 1996.  The
 Moscone Center and the San Francisco Hilton and Towers were the locations for
 the event.  The ONE ISPCON replaced a show known as ONE BBSCON, an acronym
 for Online Networking Exposition and BBS Convention.  After four years of
 staging the ONE BBSCON, the event's focus moved away from the bulletin board
 and concentrated on Internet Service Providers.  ONE, Inc. has staged an on-
 line related show the last five years and the primary organizers are
 Boardwatch Magazine editor Jack Rickard and eSoft, Inc. President Phil Becker.
 While the Pasco BBS Magazine did not have a representative at this summer's
 show, some information is becoming available.

 In the October issue of Boardwatch Magazine, speaking of the first ISPCON,
 Jack Rickard stated "A good time was had by all."  ONE ISPCON '96 had 1,940
 people in attendance, which was about half the number that attended ONE BBSCON
 '95 in Tampa.  After the attendance figures doubled each of the first three
 years of the BBSCON, the numbers did level off at around 4,000 for the August
 1995 show in Tampa.  While it is always difficult and dangerous to make
 predictions, one year ago event organizers were projecting attendance figures
 near 10,000 for the San Francisco show.  Privately, they must be disappointed
 in the turnout.  Publicly, they were trying to put a positive spin on the drop
 in attendance.  Jack Rickard called it the "Largest gathering of ISPs ever
 held."

 One traditional BBSCON mainstay was carried over to the ISPCON, but the fifth
 annual John C. Dvorak Telecommunications Excellence Awards were somewhat
 different than years past.  This year's awards concentrated on the Internet,
 instead of telecommunications in general.  The Lifetime Achievement Award went
 to Tim Berners-Lee, who is one of the inventors of the World Wide Web and the
 current Director of the World Wide Web Consortium.  A couple of the other
 winners included The Los Angeles Dodger Web Site for Outstanding Special
 Interest Web Site and the Chicago Sun-Times for Outstanding Online Newspaper.
 Many of the winners were names that most people probably never heard of
 before.

 Thursday Morning's Welcoming Session featured Tony Rutkowski speaking on "The
 Fifth Wave:  New Internet Paradigms" and Mark Corbitt on "The Impact of the
 Telecommunications Act of 1996 on ISPs."  Popular computer columnist John C.
 Dvorak gave Keynote Speech.  He gave the keynote at the first ONE BBSCON as
 well.  A few of the educational sessions were hosted by familiar names in the
 on-line world, such as Phil Becker, Kevin Behrens, Andre Duran, Jack Rickard
 and Lance Rose.  Many of the sessions were hosted by lesser known people.
 The popular "Jack and Phil Show" was gone and Kevin Behrens hosted ISP
 Roundtables instead of BBS Roundtables.  Some sessions had a familiar sound,
 such as Internet 101 and Guerrilla Marketing Your Service, but there was a new
 slate of sessions with titles like Will the Real Internet Please Stand Up,
 Protecting Your Domain Name, The New Rural America, How to Become an ISP,
 Internet Quiz Show and Internet Intangibles.

 While ONE, Inc. may have tried to follow the current trend of people moving
 away from dial-up hobby bulletin board systems and migrating over to the
 Internet, the results of the first ISPCON appear ambiguous at best.  Since the
 registration fees were almost twice as much as last year, the drop in
 attendance should not have hurt ONE, Inc. too much.  At this point, no
 details have been made available about ONE ISPCON '97.  As more information
 becomes available, about this year's and possible future shows, the Pasco BBS
 Magazine will continue to cover this story.

 Olsen Outdoors

 When I first got back into computing, and bought my first IBM compatible PC, a
 friend gave me a disk with several games on it.  One of the programs was a
 fishing game called BassTour.  At the time, I thought it was a pretty slick
 little game.  Of course, we are going back to a time before VGA graphics and
 sound cards.  It was a time when few Shareware programs were receiving any
 national publicity.  Today, companies like Apogee Software and id Software are
 making millions of dollars in the Shareware game market.  In preparing this
 article, I took another look at BassTour.  Would the game still stack up in
 today's market?  Surprising, it does.  While the graphics may appear tame by
 today's standards, it takes more than flashy graphics to make a good program.
 To the best of my knowledge, to this day, no one has developed a better
 Shareware fishing game.  The author of BassTour, Dick Olsen, has a complete
 line of fishing related Shareware programs.  This article provides some
 background information on Olsen Outdoors and looks at their current catalog.

 Dick Olsen has combined two interesting hobbies into Olsen Outdoors, which
 creates Shareware "Software for the Outdoorsman."  His efforts began in 1988
 with the release of the classic Shareware game BassTour.  Olsen Outdoors now
 specializes in PC compatible programs related to outdoor activities.  Dick
 Olsen is a member of the Association of Shareware Professionals, along with
 The Bare Hill Anglers, The Massachusetts B.A.S.S. Federation, and B.A.S.S., so
 fishing related products make up a large portion of the Olsen Outdoors
 catalog.  There are a few other programs for office and personal use, and all
 the releases are non-violent and suitable for users of all ages.  What follows
 is a list of the programs currently available from Olsen Outdoors.  The
 registration price is included.

 BassTour - This Shareware classic has been called the ultimate fishing game.
 You control a fully rigged bass boat and have over 2300 lure/color
 combinations to choose from.  You may also choose from six different fishing
 rods.  The game features a trolling motor, LCD chart recorder, a live well and
 many other options.  You can fish by yourself, or join a three day tournament
 against the 30 top names in bass fishing.  BassTour runs on CGA, MCGA,
 Hercules, EGA, VGA and SVGA systems with 512k of memory.  A registered version
 is $17.00 on a 3.5" disk and $15.00 on a 5.25" disk.

 BassDuel - BassDuel is a two player fishing tournament where both players fish
 from the same boat, just like in the real tournaments.  The main player
 controls boat movement and can use a mouse while the 'partner' fishes from the
 rear of the boat and can use a joystick or the keyboard.  Each player has
 eight rods and a fully stocked tackle box.  The boat even has a divided
 live-well.  Check out the realistic head-to-head competition against your
 partner and 30 of the top names in bass tournament fishing.  BassDuel requires
 EGA or true VGA and 512k of memory.  Registration is $17.00 for a 3.5" disk
 and $15.00 for a 5.25" disk.

 Bass Class - Bass Class is not only a great fishing game, it is a learning
 tool as well.  While not a tournament situation, it has all the other features
 that BassTour has and more.  It has an on-screen glossary of fishing terms,
 and is loaded with on-line help and suggestions.  On-screen contour maps and
 an LCD fish finder are standard.  Very realistic lure behavior teaches you the
 right lures for different situations.  The program is highly educational and
 lots of fun.  Bass Class requires EGA or true VGA and 512k of memory.
 Registration is $17.00 for a 3.5" disk, or $15.00 for a 5.25" disk.

 BassTips - BassTips is a collection of over 100 fishing, boating, and
 environmental tips.  It comes with a tip editor so you can add your own tips
 to the program.  BassTips can be configured so that a tip is displayed on your
 screen each time you boot-up your computer.  BassTips can improve everyone's
 fishing.  The program requires 256k of memory and works on color or monochrome
 displays.  Registration is $12.00 for a 3.5" disk and $10.00 for a 5.25" disk.

 FishBase ][ - FishBase ][ is a fisherman's log book and data base program that
 also gives you lots of statistics about the fish you catch.  With FishBase ][,
 you can see what lures accounted for the most fish, or see what effect the
 moon phases have on your results.  The search and sort capability is fast and
 easy to use.  The program requires at least 256k of memory and runs on color
 or monochrome systems.  A hard disk is preferred for optimum speed and
 efficiency.  Registration is $17.00 for a 3.5" disk, or $15.00 for 5.25" disk.

 Race The Nags - Race The Nags is a full color horse racing game for up to six
 players.  Six horses (from a stable of over 200) gallop across your screen in
 a race for the finish line.  Statistics are kept for all horses and you can
 view them with the included utility program.  Start the game with $500 in seed
 money and place your bets to win, place, or show.  If you're good, you may
 make the Top Ten Hall Of Fame.  If you're good, you may earn membership in the
 elite Millionaires Club.  Race The Nags requires EGA or better and 512k of
 memory.  Registration is $17.00 for a 3.5" disk and $15.00 for 5.25" disk.

 Tikler - Tikler is a fast, extremely easy to use appointment/reminder program
 that you'll find indispensable.  Use it to remind you of upcoming tournaments,
 meetings, anniversaries and birthdays.  You can set how many days in advance
 you want to be notified.  The program handles up to 600 events and has a
 built-in perpetual calendar.  It can be used in the conventional TSR mode,
 swapping TSR mode or non-TSR mode.  Tikler requires 256k of memory and
 supports color or monochrome systems.  Registration is $17.00 for a 3.5" disk,
 or $15.00 for 5.25" disk.

 Olsen Outdoors also offers additional non-Shareware programs and add-on
 accessories, such as a program called BassDuel Deluxe.  There are also
 additional lakes available.

 Dick Olsen is a long-time friend of Dan Linton and Nels Anderson, as they all
 worked at Prime Computer together.  Dan Linton has written some Shareware
 programs himself, but is best known as the President of Software Creations.
 Nels Anderson also has written Shareware programs, including the very popular
 Mah Jongg.  He has also written a Map Editor for BassTour, so people can
 create their own lakes.  The latest versions of Olsen Outdoors software may be
 obtained from Nel Anderson's Xevious BBS at (508) 788-6951 and from Dan
 Linton's Software Creations (508) 368-7036.  Software Creations may also be
 reached on the World Wide Web at http://www.swcbbs.com.  To order the programs
 call (508) 486-3985.  Personal checks, money orders, purchase orders, credit
 cards and cash are accepted.  Shipping charges are $2.00 within North America
 and all orders are shipped on 3.5 inch disks unless otherwise requested.  The
 mailing address is Olsen Outdoors, 68 Hartwell Avenue, Littleton, MA 01460.

 Computer Basics
 ---------------

 Written by Ed Garwood, Hudson, FL

 Directories

 One of the most misunderstood things in "Computerese" is the term "Directory."
 We know that typing "DIR" will give us a list of the programs, etc., on the
 disk, but when it comes to dealing with directories or sub-directories, we're
 not too sure just which way we should turn.

 Let's look at a typical DIR result:

 FILE          <DIR>         02-27-96      11:46a
 FRUITS        <DIR>         02-27-96      11:47a
 WINDOWS       <DIR>         02-27-96      11:48a
 WRITE         <DIR>         02-27-96      11:49a
 AUTOEXEC BAT           328  01-01-96      12:10a
 COMMAND  COM          3415  01-02-96       1:15p
 CONFIG   SYS           299  01-03-96      10:00a
 NOSOUND  COM            54  01-02-96      11:57a
 PRIVACY  EXE         24576  01-10-96       4:29p

 You will note that the first four entries have the symbol <DIR> in them,
 meaning they are directories.  The other five have the extensions listed, plus
 a number representing the number of bytes in the program.  They are plain
 files.

 Let's take FRUITS for instance.  If you were to type FRUITS at the prompt, you
 would get the message "Bad File."  That's because FRUITS is a Directory.  If
 you would type "CD\FRUITS" you would get the following prompt:

 C:\ FRUITS >

 Then, if you typed DIR, you would get the following:

 .             <DIR>         02-27-96      11:47a
 ..            <DIR>         02-27-96      11:47a
 APPLES   EXE        12019   02-27-96      11:48a
 BANANAS  EXE         8093   02-27-96      11:50a
 CHERRIES      <DIR>         02-27-96      11:55a

 This means that APPLES and BANANAS are separate programs, within the FRUITS
 directory, whereas CHERRIES is a sub-directory.  To get to the CHERRIES
 programs, you would have to type CD\FRUITS\CHERRIES and then type DIR.

 What does this all mean?  Why so complicated?

 Think of a set of books about FRUITS.  It's in the FRUIT book case, in Room C.
 There are several books in the set, the first three being titled A, B, and C
 respectively.

 Now, if we want to look up Apples, we go to Room C (which corresponds to Drive
 C:) and we go over to the FRUIT book case (which corresponds to the FRUIT
 directory).  Since we want to look up Apples, we would go to the first Book,
 A, (which corresponds to the Apples program).

 Now, suppose we wanted to look up Cherries.  Following the above routine, we
 would end up with Book C.  However, because there are a number of Cherry
 types, the book is divided into two parts.  Part one for Light cherries and
 part 2 for dark cherries.  Likewise, the Cherries Directory above has a sub-
 directory.  The following would get us down to the two parts:

 C:\cd\fruits\cherries

 Typing DIR would then give us

 DIR.                     02-27-96    1:14p
 DIR..                    02-27-96    1:14p
 LIGHT     EXE     1240   02-27-96    1:28p
 DARK      EXE     1356   02-27-96    1:30p

 If we were looking up Dark cherries, we would then type Dark.exe and we would
 get our program.

 Why do we have to go through this rigmarole?  Well, DOS puts a limit of 512
 files or directories in the root directory of your hard disk.  Plus, DOS
 starts to go slower if you have more than 150 files and sub-directories in one
 directory.  So, we have to break things up into portions which are more easily
 handled.  For instance, some graphics programs may have 15 or more sub-
 directories, with each sub-directory have 40 or more individual files.  With a
 limit of 512, entries, one big program could jam up your directory, and you
 could not add more programs.

 Think of the Directory as a library, with different areas of information, each
 area being subdivided and sub-subdivided as necessary.  First you enter the
 building, then you go to a particular area or floor, then to a particular
 room, then to a particular set of shelves, etc.  It's a logical sequence of
 events.  So it is with the Computer Directory system.

 Just remember.  When you see an entry with <DIR> following it, you must type
 cd\ plus the entry name to get there.

 Oh yes.  What do you do when you are finished reading about the Dark Cherries?
 Just type cd\ at the prompt.  This will bring you back to your basic root
 directory.

 USAPuzzle! Review
 -----------------

 Lynnwood, Ohio based Torpedo Software has released a challenging educational
 game for Windows called USAPuzzle!  The Shareware version lets the user learn
 about the states and their capitals, while the registered version features
 countries of the world.  USAPuzzle! is actually level one of the registered
 version called GEOPuzzle!

 The Shareware version is two U.S. geography puzzles, one for the states and
 one for their capitals.  The puzzle pieces consist of the states and star
 icons for the capitals, which must be dragged by the user to their correct
 position on an animated map of the United States.  Using the hide option makes
 the program much more difficult, as it eliminates the outlines of the states,
 or stars that indicate capitals, on the game map.  It might be considered
 difficult enough to match up the capital with each state, let alone remember
 the exact location where the capital city is located within the state.  The
 same option is available in the states puzzle, as users can decide if they
 want to have the map display an outline of the states.  The available timer
 can add another challenge to the game.

 USAPuzzle! is a colorful and easy to use program.  It is worth checking out if
 you are looking for an educational U.S. geography program.

 Microsoft Inc. announced they will offer unlimited Internet on the Microsoft
 Network (MSN) for a monthly fee of $19.95.  MSN has attracted 1.6 million
 subscribers over its first year, which makes it the third largest on-line
 service.  America Online has 6.5 million subscribers and CompuServe has 4.5
 million.  In related news, on Thursday September 19, Microsoft announced the
 Department of Justice was investigating how the company sells its Internet
 software.  The DOJ last investigated the company in the summer of 1995, when
 Microsoft announced plans for an on-line network.  Microsoft is also expected

 Explorer, by Christmas.

 Last month, it was reported that Galacticomm Chairman Tim Stryker had died on
 August 7, 1986.  While questions remain, it appears that he was the victim of
 self-inflicted wounds.  He was 41 years old.  Last month's issue called Fort
 Lauderdale, Florida home to Stryker, but he had moved to Utah in 1993.
 Galacticomm announced that Bob Shaw, the company's chief executive officer,
 would serve as the new Chairman of the Board.

 Apple Computer Inc. has reported a fourth quarter profit of $25 million.  This
 was somewhat of a surprise to market analysts, as the company had reported $69
 million, $700 million and $32 million in losses for the first three quarters
 of the year.

 In last year's November issue, the Pasco BBS Magazine ran an update on the
 Association of Online Professionals (AOP).  The article featured information
 from AOP promotional material, along with some comments made at ONE BBSCON '95
 in Tampa.  Jack Rickard, editor of Boardwatch Magazine and President of ONE
 Inc., made some interesting remarks, while endorsing the AOP at the Welcoming
 Session for the last BBSCON.  This month we reprint some of what Jack Rickard
 had to say in the summer of 1995.

 "Every year it seemed there was someone who came up with the idea of forming
 some sort of association of bulletin board operators.  I watched quite a
 parade of them come out, announce something, hope for 15,000 or 20,000 members
 instantly and when they didn't materialize, move on.  The question is why
 can't we get all the BBS operators to do x, whatever x is.  Basically, I
 didn't know.  I had never seen all the bulletin board operators do anything.
 If you got all the bulletin board operators in the world, and laid them end-
 to-end, they couldn't reach a conclusion, much less lunch.  They are a fairly
 independent group of people and getting them to do anything is a lot like
 herding cats.  I think one of the reasons they run bulletin boards, on-line
 services and their own Web sites is that the rest of the world didn't do to
 suit them.  So, they built another one where they could have a little control
 and do it their way."

 "Politically, almost all of the bulletin board operators tend to be
 Libertarians.  None of them actually join the Libertarian Party, there's too
 many rules, you don't really buy into all of it, but the tendency is towards
 Libertarianism, just don't want to actually become a member.  When we started
 Boardwatch Magazine people who ran on-line services were viewed much as you
 might a group of people who met every Tuesday evening to exchange
 toothbrushes.  They do what?  Why do they do that?  In recent years, it's not
 that much of a niche.  This has gone quite into the national eye and its
 become a bit of a mainstream thing.  It also lead to a curious desire by our
 governing structure to do two things, one is to regulate it, and the other is
 tax it.  To defend ourselves we are going to have to make some concessions on
 the I don't join and I don't get involved position.  The first organization
 I've joined in ten years is now this Association of On-Line Professionals."

 Excuse Maker Review
 -------------------

 Excuse Maker, a humor program for Windows created by OneShot Software, is
 designed to generate the "perfect" excuse.  Dozens of different excuses can be
 printed out in full color.  It is an easy to use program.

 To generate an excuse, the user first must select which one to use.  An
 example of one of the excuses is that "Someone had to help deliver that herd
 of turkeys."  After selecting an excuse, the user clicks on the print icon and
 will have to fill out several fields prior to printing.  The fields are "this
 note excuses," "this excuse is being sent to" and "this excuse is from the
 desk of."  When the excuse is printed, the "from the desk of" will appear at
 the top of the note.  The next line printed will say "Dear" and the name that
 was inputed as the receiver of the note.  The following line will say "Please
 excuse" and the name entered as the person to be excused.  On the last line
 will be the name of the person sending the note.  So, the notes will begin
 with please excuse whatever the person's name is.  That will be followed by
 the actual excuse.  A couple of excuses are, "or we'll find someone to make
 you eat this excuse" and "then you can blow your nose on this paper."

 Excuse Maker is a cute program with no fees associated with registration.
 However, one glitch is that when the note is printed, a small icon appears at
 the bottom.

 Copyright Law:  Part I
 ----------------------

 > What is a Copyright?

 Copyright is a form of protection provided by the laws of the United States
 (title 17, U.S. Code) to the authors of original works of authorship;
 including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and certain other
 intellectual works.  This protection is available to both published and
 unpublished works.  Section 106 of the Copyright Act generally gives the owner
 of copyright the exclusive right to do and to authorize others to do the
 following:

 To reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords; To prepare
 derivative works based upon the copyrighted work; To distribute copies or
 phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer
 of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending;

 To perform the copyrighted work publicly, in the case of literary, musical,
 dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other
 audiovisual works; and

 To display the copyrighted work publicly, in the case of literary, musical,
 dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or
 sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion picture or other
 audiovisual work.

 It is illegal for anyone to violate any of the rights provided by the Act to
 the owner of copyright.  These rights, however, are not unlimited in scope.

 Sections 107 through 119 of the Copyright Act establish limitations on these
 rights.  In some cases, these limitations are specified exemptions from
 copyright liability.  One major limitation is the doctrine of fair use, which
 is given a statutory basis in section 107 of the Act.  In other instances, the
 limitation takes the form of a compulsory license under which certain limited
 uses of copyrighted works are permitted upon payment of specified royalties
 and compliance with statutory conditions.  For further information about the
 limitations of any of these rights, consult the Copyright Act or write to
 the Copyright Office.

 > Who Can Claim a Copyright

 Copyright protection subsists from the time the work is created in fixed form;
 that is, it is an incident of the process of authorship.  The copyright in the
 work of authorship immediately becomes the property of the author who created
 it.  Only the author or those deriving their rights through the author can
 rightfully claim copyright.

 In the case of works made for hire, the employer and not the employee is
 presumptively considered the author.  Section 101 of the copyright statute
 defines a work made for hire as:

 (1) a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment;
     or

 (2) a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a
     collective work, as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work,
     as a translation, as a supplementary work, as a compilation, as an
     instructional text, as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an
     atlas, if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by
     them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire....

 The authors of a joint work are co-owners of the copyright in the work, unless
 there is an agreement to the contrary.  Copyright in each separate
 contribution to a periodical or other collective work is distinct from
 copyright in the collective work as a whole and vests initially with the
 author of the contribution.

 Two General Principles

 Mere ownership of a book, manuscript, painting, or any other copy or
 phonorecord does not give the possessor the copyright.  The law provides that
 transfer of ownership of any material object that embodies a protected work
 does not of itself convey any rights in the copyright.

 Minors may claim copyright, but state laws may regulate the business dealings
 involving copyrights owned by minors.  For information on relevant state laws,
 consult an attorney.

 > Copyright and National Origin of the Work

 Copyright protection is available for all unpublished works, regardless of the
 nationality or domicile of the author.  Published works are eligible for
 copyright protection in the United States if any one of the following
 conditions is met:

 On the date of first publication, one or more of the authors is a national or
 domiciliary of the United States or is a national, domiciliary, or sovereign
 authority of a foreign nation that is a party to a copyright treaty to which
 the United States is also a party, or is a stateless person wherever that
 person may be domiciled; or

 The work is first published in the United States or in a foreign nation that,
 on the date of first publication, is a party to the Universal Copyright
 Convention; or the work comes within the scope of a Presidential proclamation;
 or

 The work is first published on or after March 1, 1989, in a foreign nation
 that on the date of first publication, is a party to the Berne Convention; or,
 if the work is not first published in a country party to the Berne Convention,
 it is published (on or after March 1, 1989) within 30 days of first
 publication in a country that is party to the Berne Convention; or the work,
 first published on or after March 1, 1989, is a pictorial, graphic, or
 sculptural work that is incorporated in a permanent structure located in the
 United States; or, if the work, first published on or after March 1, 1989, is
 a published audiovisual work, all the authors are legal entities with
 headquarters in the United States.

 > What Works are Protected?

 Copyright protects original works of authorship that are fixed in a tangible
 form of expression.  The fixation need not be directly perceptible, so long as
 it may be communicated with the aid of a machine or device.  Copyrightable
 works include the following categories:

 (1) literary works;

 (2) musical works, including any accompanying words;

 (3) dramatic works, including any accompanying music;

 (4) pantomimes and choreographic works;

 (5) pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works;

 (6) motion pictures and other audiovisual works;

 (7) sound recordings; and

 (8) architectural works.

 These categories should be viewed quite broadly: for example, computer
 programs and most compilations are registrable as literary works; maps and
 architectural plans are registrable as pictorial, graphic, and sculptural
 works.

 > What is Not Protected by Copyright?

 Several categories of material are generally not eligible for statutory
 copyright protection.  These include among others:

 Works that have not been fixed in a tangible form of expression.  For example:
 choreographic works that have not been notated or recorded, or improvisational
 speeches or performances that have not been written or recorded.  Titles,
 names, short phrases, and slogans; familiar symbols or designs; mere
 variations of typographic ornamentation, lettering, or coloring; mere listings
 of ingredients or contents.  Ideas, procedures, methods, systems, processes,
 concepts, principles, discoveries, or devices, as distinguished from a
 description, explanation, or illustration.  Works consisting entirely of
 information that is common property and containing no original authorship.
 For example:  standard calendars, height and weight charts, tape measures and
 rulers, and lists or tables taken from public documents or other common
 sources.

 > How to Secure a Copyright

 Copyright Secured Automatically Upon Creation

 The way in which copyright protection is secured under the present law is
 frequently misunderstood.  No publication or registration or other action in
 the Copyright Office is required to secure copyright (see following NOTE).
 There are, however, certain definite advantages to registration.

 NOTE:  Before 1978, statutory copyright was generally secured by the act of
 publication with notice of copyright, assuming compliance with all other
 relevant statutory conditions.  Works in the public domain on January 1, 1978
 (for example, works published without satisfying all conditions for securing
 statutory copyright under the Copyright Act of 1909) remain in the public
 domain under the current act.  Statutory copyright could also be secured
 before 1978 by the act of registration in the case of certain unpublished
 works and works eligible for ad interim copyright. The current Act
 automatically extends to full term section 304 sets the term) copyright for
 all works including those subject to ad interim copyright if ad interim
 registration has been made on or before June 30, 1978.

 Copyright is secured automatically when the work is created, and a work is
 created when it is fixed in a copy or phonorecord for the first time.  Copies
 are material objects from which a work can be read or visually perceived
 either directly or with the aid of a machine or device, such as books,
 manuscripts, sheet music, film, videotape, or microfilm.  Phonorecords
 are material objects embodying fixations of sounds (excluding, by statutory
 definition, motion picture soundtracks), such as cassette tapes, CD's, or
 LP's.  Thus, for example, a song (the work) can be fixed in sheet music
 (copies) or in phonograph disks (phonorecords), or both.

 If a work is prepared over a period of time, the part of the work that is
 fixed on a particular date constitutes the created work as of that date.

 > Publication

 Publication is no longer the key to obtaining statutory copyright as it was
 under the Copyright Act of 1909.  However, publication remains important to
 copyright owners.

 The Copyright Act defines publication as follows:

 Publication is the distribution of copies or phonorecords of a work to the
 public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or
 lending.  The offering to distribute copies or phonorecords to a group of
 persons for purposes of further distribution, public performance, or public
 display constitutes publication.  A public performance or display of a work
 does not of itself constitute publication.

 A further discussion of the definition of publication can be found in the
 legislative history of the Act.  The legislative reports define to the public;
 as distribution to persons under no explicit or implicit restrictions with
 respect to disclosure of the contents.  The reports state that the definition
 makes it clear that the sale of phonorecords constitutes publication of the
 underlying work, for example, the musical, dramatic, or literary work embodied
 in a phonorecord.  The reports also state that it is clear that any form of
 dissemination in which the material object does not change hands, for example,
 performances or displays on television, is not a publication no matter how
 many people are exposed to the work.  However, when copies or phonorecords are
 offered for sale or lease to a group of wholesalers, broadcasters, or motion
 picture theaters, publication does take place if the purpose is further
 distribution, public performance, or public display.

 Publication is an important concept in the copyright law for several reasons:

 When a work is published, it may bear a notice of copyright to identify the
 year of publication and the name of the copyright owner and to inform the
 public that the work is protected by copyright.  Works published before March
 1, 1989, must bear the notice or risk loss of copyright protection.  (See
 discussion "notice of copyright" below.)

 Works that are published in the United States are subject to mandatory deposit
 with the Library of Congress.  (See discussion on mandatory deposit, below.)

 Publication of a work can affect the limitations on the exclusive rights of
 the copyright owner that are set forth in sections 107 through 120 of the law.

 The year of publication may determine the duration of copyright protection for
 anonymous and pseudonymous works (when the author's identity is not revealed
 in the records of the Copyright Office) and for works made for hire.

 Deposit requirements for registration of published works differ from those for
 registration of unpublished works.  (See discussion on registration
 procedures, below.)

 > Notice of Copyright

 For works first published on and after March 1, 1989, use of the copyright
 notice is optional, though highly recommended.  Before March 1, 1989, the use
 of the notice was mandatory on all published works, and any work first
 published before that date must bear a notice or risk loss of copyright
 protection.

 (The Copyright Office does not take a position on whether works first
 published with notice before March 1, 1989, and reprinted and distributed on
 and after March 1, 1989, must bear the copyright notice.)

 Use of the notice is recommended because it informs the public that the work
 is protected by copyright, identifies the copyright owner, and shows the year
 of first publication.  Furthermore, in the event that a work is infringed, if
 the work carries a proper notice, the court will not allow a defendant to
 claim innocent infringement--that is, that he or she did not realize that the
 work is protected.  (A successful innocent infringement claim may result in a
 reduction in damages that the copyright owner would otherwise receive.)

 The use of the copyright notice is the responsibility of the copyright owner
 and does not require advance permission from, or registration with, the
 Copyright Office.

 Form of Notice for Visually Perceptible Copies

 The notice for visually perceptible copies should contain all of the following
 three elements:

 1.   The symbol (the letter in a circle), or the word Copyright or the
      abbreviation Copr.; and

 2. The year of first publication of the work.  In the case of compilations or
    derivative works incorporating previously published material, the year date
    of first publication of the compilation or derivative work is sufficient.
    The year date may be omitted where a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural
    work, with accompanying textual matter, if any, is reproduced in or on
    greeting cards, postcards, stationery, jewelry, dolls, toys, or any useful
    article; and

 3. The name of the owner of copyright in the work, or an abbreviation by which
    the name can be recognized, or a generally known alternative designation of
    the owner.

  Example:  1995 John Doe

 The C in a circle notice is used only on visually perceptible copies.  Certain
 kinds of works--for example, musical, dramatic, and literary works--may be
 fixed not in copies but by means of sound in an audio recording.  Since audio
 recordings such as audio tapes and phonograph disks are phonorecords and not
 copies, the C in a circle notice is not used to indicate protection of the
 underlying musical, dramatic, or literary work that is recorded.

 Form of Notice for Phonorecords of Sound Recordings

 The copyright notice for phonorecords of sound recordings* has somewhat
 different requirements.  The notice appearing on phonorecords should contain
 the following three elements:

 *Sound recordings are defined as works that result from the fixation of a
 series of musical, spoken, or other sounds, but not including the sounds
 accompanying a motion picture or other audiovisual work, regardless of the
 nature of the material objects, such as disks, tapes, or other phonorecords,
 in which they are embodied.

 1. The symbol (the letter P in a circle); and

 2. The year of first publication of the sound recording; and

 3. The name of the owner of copyright in the sound recording, or an
    abbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or a generally known
    alternative designation of the owner.  If the producer of the sound
    recording is named on the phonorecord labels or containers, and if no other
    name appears in conjunction with the notice, the producer's name shall be
    considered a part of the notice.

 NOTE:  Since questions may arise from the use of variant forms of the notice,
 any form of the notice other than those given here should not be used without
 first seeking legal advice.

 Position of Notice

 The notice should be affixed to copies or phonorecords of the work in such a
 manner and location as to give reasonable notice of the claim of
 copyright.  The notice on phonorecords may appear on the surface of the
 phonorecord or on the phonorecord label or container, provided the manner of
 placement and location give reasonable notice of the claim.  The three
 elements of the notice should ordinarily appear together on the copies or
 phonorecords.  The Copyright Office has issued regulations concerning the form
 and position of the copyright notice in the Code of Federal Regulations (37
 CFR Part 201).  For more information, request Circular 3.

 Publications Incorporating United States Government Works

 Works by the U.S. Government are not eligible for copyright protection.  For
 works published on and after March 1, 1989, the previous notice requirement
 for works consisting primarily of one or more U.S. Government works has been
 eliminated.  However, use of the copyright notice for these works is still
 strongly recommended.  Use of a notice on such a work will defeat a claim of
 innocent infringement as previously described provided the notice also
 includes a statement that identifies one of the following:  those portions of
 the work in which copyright is claimed or those portions that constitute U.S.
 Government material.

 An example is:

 1994 Jane Brown.  Copyright claimed in Chapters 7-10, exclusive of U.S.
 Government maps.

 Works published before March 1, 1989, that consist primarily of one or more
 works of the U.S. Government must bear a notice and the identifying statement.

 Unpublished Works

 To avoid an inadvertent publication without notice, the author or other owner
 of copyright may wish to place a copyright notice on any copies or
 phonorecords that leave his or her control.  An appropriate notice for an
 unpublished work is:

 Unpublished work 1994 Jane Doe.

 Effect of Omission of the Notice or of Error in the Name or Date

 The Copyright Act, in sections 405 and 406, provides procedures for correcting
 errors and omissions of the copyright notice on works published on or after
 January 1, 1978, and before March 1, 1989.  In general, if a notice was
 omitted or an error was made on copies distributed on or after January 1,
 1978, and before March 1, 1989, the copyright was not automatically lost.
 Copyright protection may be maintained if registration for the work has been
 made before or is made within 5 years after the publication without notice,
 and a reasonable effort is made to add the notice to all copies or
 phonorecords that are distributed to the public in the United States after the
 omission has been discovered.  For more information request Circular 3.

 > How Long Copyright Protection Endures

 Works Originally Created On or After January 1, 1978

 A work that is created (fixed in tangible form for the first time) on or after
 January 1, 1978, is automatically protected from the moment of its creation,
 and is ordinarily given a term enduring for the author's life, plus an
 additional 50 years after the author's death. In the case of a joint work
 prepared by two or more authors who did not work for hire, the term lasts for
 50 years after the last surviving author's death.  For works made for hire,
 and for anonymous and pseudonymous works (unless the author's identity is
 revealed in Copyright Office records), the duration of copyright will be 75
 years from publication or 100 years from creation, whichever is shorter.

 Works Originally Created Before January 1, 1978, But Not Published or
 Registered by That Date

 Works that were created but not published or registered for copyright before
 January 1, 1978, have been automatically brought under the statute and are now
 given Federal copyright protection.  The duration of copyright in these works
 will generally be computed in the same way as for works created on or after
 January 1, 1978:  the life-plus-50 or 75/100-year terms will apply to them as
 well.

 The law provides that in no case will the term of copyright for works in this
 category expire before December 31, 2002, and for works published on or before
 December 31, 2002, the term of copyright will not expire before December 31,
 2027.

 Works Originally Created and Published or Registered Before January 1, 1978

 Under the law in effect before 1978, copyright was secured either on the date
 a work was published or on the date of registration if the work was registered
 in unpublished form.  In either case, the copyright endured for a first term
 of 28 years from the date it was secured. During the last (28th) year of the
 first term, the copyright was eligible for renewal.  The current copyright law
 has extended the renewal term from 28 to 47 years for copyrights that were
 subsisting on January 1, 1978, making these works eligible for a total term of
 protection of 75 years.

 Public Law 102-307, enacted on June 26, 1992, amended the Copyright Act of
 1976 to extend automatically the term of copyrights secured from January 1,
 1964, through December 31, 1977 to the further term of 47 years and increased
 the filing fee from $12 to $20.  This fee increase applies to all renewal
 applications filed on or after June 29, 1992.  P.L. 102-307 makes renewal
 registration optional.  There is no need to make the renewal filing in order
 to extend the original 28-year copyright term to the full 75 years.  However,
 some benefits accrue to making a renewal registration during the 28th year of
 the original term.  For more detailed information on the copyright term, write
 to the Copyright Office and request Circulars 15, 15a, and 15t.  For
 information on how to search the Copyright Office records concerning the
 copyright status of a work, request Circular 22.

 > Transfer of Copyright

 Any or all of the exclusive rights, or any subdivision of those rights, of the
 copyright owner may be transferred, but the transfer of exclusive rights is
 not valid unless that transfer is in writing and signed by the owner of the
 rights conveyed (or such owner's duly authorized agent).  Transfer of a right
 on a nonexclusive basis does not require a written agreement.

 A copyright may also be conveyed by operation of law and may be bequeathed by
 will or pass as personal property by the applicable laws of interstate
 succession.

 Copyright is a personal property right, and it is subject to the various state
 laws and regulations that govern the ownership, inheritance, or transfer of
 personal property as well as terms of contracts or conduct of business.  For
 information about relevant state laws, consult an attorney.

 Transfers of copyright are normally made by contract.  The Copyright Office
 does not have or supply any forms for such transfers.  However, the law does
 provide for the recordation in the Copyright Office of transfers of copyright
 ownership.  Although recordation is not required to make a valid transfer
 between the parties, it does provide certain legal advantages and may be
 required to validate the transfer as against third parties.  For information
 on recordation of transfers and other documents related to copyright, request
 Circular 12.

 Termination of Transfers

 Under the previous law, the copyright in a work reverted to the author, if
 living, or if the author was not living, to other specified beneficiaries,
 provided a renewal claim was registered in the 28th year of the original term.
 [The copyright in works eligible for renewal on or after June 26, 1992, will
 vest in the name of the renewal claimant on the effective date of any renewal
 registration made during the 28th year of the original term.  Otherwise, the
 renewal copyright will vest in the party entitled to claim renewal as of
 December 31st of the 28th year.]  The present law drops the renewal feature
 except for works already in the first term of statutory protection when the
 present law took effect.  Instead, the present law permits termination of a
 grant of rights after 35 years under certain conditions by serving written
 notice on the transferee within specified time limits.

 For works already under statutory copyright protection before 1978, the
 present law provides a similar right of termination covering the newly added
 years that extended the former maximum term of the copyright from 56 to 75
 years.  For further information, request Circulars 15a and 15t.

 > International Copyright Protection

 There is no such thing as an international copyright that will automatically
 protect an author's writings throughout the entire world.  Protection against
 unauthorized use in a particular country depends, basically, on the national
 laws of that country.  However, most countries do offer protection to foreign
 works under certain conditions, and these conditions have been greatly
 simplified by international copyright treaties and conventions.  For a list of
 countries which maintain copyright relations with the United States, request
 Circular 38a.

 The United States belongs to both global, multilateral copyright treaties--the
 Universal Copyright Convention (UCC) and the Berne Convention for the
 Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.  The United States was a founding
 member of the UCC, which came into force on September 16, 1955.  Generally, a
 work by a national or domiciliary of a country that is a member of the UCC or
 a work first published in a UCC country may claim protection under the UCC.
 If the work bears the notice of copyright in the form and position specified
 by the UCC, this notice will satisfy and substitute for any other formalities
 a UCC member country would otherwise impose as a condition of copyright.  A
 UCC notice should consist of the symbol accompanied by the name of the
 copyright proprietor and the year of first publication of the work.

 By joining the Berne Convention on March 1, 1989, the United States gained
 protection for its authors in all member nations of the Berne Union with which
 the United States formerly had either no copyright relations or had bilateral
 treaty arrangements.  Members of the Berne Union agree to a certain minimum
 level of copyright protection and agree to treat nationals of other member
 countries like their own nationals for purposes of copyright.  A work first
 published in the United States or another Berne Union country (or first
 published in a non-Berne country, followed by publication within 30 days in a
 Berne Union country) is eligible for protection in all Berne member countries.
 There are no special requirements.

 For information on the legislation implementing the Berne Convention, request
 Circular 93 from the Copyright Office.

 An author who wishes protection for his or her work in a particular country
 should first find out the extent of protection of foreign works in that
 country.  If possible, this should be done before the work is published
 anywhere, since protection may often depend on the facts existing at the time
 of first publication.

 If the country in which protection is sought is a party to one of the
 international copyright conventions, the work may generally be protected by
 complying with the conditions of the convention.  Even if the work cannot be
 brought under an international convention, protection under the specific
 provisions of the country's national laws may still be possible.  Some
 countries, however, offer little or no copyright protection for foreign works.

 Editors Note:  Look for the rest of this law to be published in next month's
 issue under the title, Copyright Law: Part II.
