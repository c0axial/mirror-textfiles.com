 Editor's Welcome
 ----------------

 Well, welcome to the last issue of 1994.  As we approached the end of the
 year, I want to take a second to wish all of you the happiest of holiday
 seasons!

 This month we continue our comprehensive coverage of the upcoming ONE BBSCON
 next summer in downtown Tampa, with a look at the history of the event.  Paul
 Pollack has a feature called "Surfing the Boards," which takes a look at some
 of what can be found in the BBS world.  I also wish to thank Paul for the kind
 words about the Board of Trade BBS.  Thanks also go out to Matt Holden for his
 review of the door game Advanced Xoru.  This issue also has a look at the new
 28.8 modems and features an updated BBS Glossary.  Also, beginning with this
 issue, we will carry extractions from ROTFL Digest!  This on-line humor
 magazine has been around for awhile, and I want to thank editor Sandy Illes
 for allowing the reproduction of some of their computer related humor.

 Thanks for reading, and thanks to everyone who contributed to this issue!

 History of the ONE BBSCON
 -------------------------

 Jack Rickard, editor of Boardwatch Magazine, and Phil Becker, President of
 eSoft, Inc., formed ONE, Inc. (Online Networking Expositions, Incorporated) as
 a vehicle to host the first ONE BBSCON in 1992.  Jack Rickard serves as
 President of ONE, Inc. and Phil Becker acts as Secretary/Treasurer.  These two
 men created, and have nurtured, the Online Networking Exposition and BBS
 Convention, better known as the ONE BBSCON.  The event has grown by leaps and
 bounds over its three year history and the future looks amazingly bright as
 the event heads to Tampa in 1995.  This article touches on some of the history
 of what has become the largest gathering of telecommunication enthusiasts to
 be held each year.

 The birth of the ONE BBSCON goes back to August of 1991, when an event known
 as FIDOCON91 was held in Denver.  At ONE BBSCON '94, Phil Becker talked about
 that first BBS related convention.  "There was fortuitous FIDOCON in Denver.
 Which didn't look like a fortuitous event to either Jack or I when it
 happened, because it was happening in our town and we were going to get roped
 into it and we weren't real sure we wanted to be involved in it.  In fact, it
 is sort of part of what pushed us into doing ONE BBSCON."  Rickard and Becker
 did the first "Jack and Phil Show" at that FIDOCON and went on to make an
 American success story out of the ONE BBSCON.

 The first ONE BBSCON was held the year after the FIDOCON91 at an airport hotel
 in Denver.  There were 950 people at that first time event.  The second year
 almost 2,000 attended the show, which was held 70 miles south in a resort
 hotel in suburban Colorado Springs.  For the third convention, almost 4,000
 people showed up in downtown Atlanta.  Phil Becker has told the editor of the
 Pasco BBS Magazine that "this thing is growing at such a curve.  I would say
 that the way we're growing and going, in Tampa we will probably have 7,000 to
 8,000 at least."  For many Sysops a BBSCON is not only a business trip, but
 looked upon as a vacation.  The first two events were held in the majestic
 natural beauty of Colorado's Rocky Mountains.  1993's event was held at a
 sprawling high class resort at the base of Pike's Peak, which provides the
 splendid scenery that inspired the song "God Bless America."  While the
 downtown Atlanta site may not quite have had the same type of atmosphere,
 downtown Tampa should provide for a wonderful setting.  Those of you who are
 familiar with the Convention Center, Harbour Island, Franklin Street area know
 what I mean.  Below are the dates and sites of the first three BBSCONs.

 ONE BBSCON '92  August 13-16, 1992  Stouffer Concourse Hotel, Denver
 ONE BBSCON '93  August 25-29, 1993  The Broadmoor Hotel, Colorado Springs
 ONE BBSCON '94  August 17-21, 1994  Marriott Marquis Hotel & Inforum, Atlanta

 The ONE BBSCON Executive Advisory Board was created from the beginning to
 represent all the various viewpoints in the on-line world.  As Jack Rickard
 stated at a previous ONE BBSCON, "if we dream it up out of one person's mind,
 it's naturally going to be a very narrow type view.  So, one of the things we
 wanted to do with ONE BBSCON is include all the views and all the activities."
 That philosophy is the major underlying theme behind the success of the ONE
 BBSCON.  Below are the members of the Executive Advisory Board for the first
 three conventions.

 ONE BBSCON '92 Executive Advisory Board
 Jim Harrer, President, Mustang Software
 Fred Clark, President, Clark Development Company, Inc.
 Tim Stryker, President, Galacticomm, Inc.
 Steven Laliberte, Director, BIX Online Services

 The keynote speaker is the last one to talk at Thursday morning's Opening
 Session and that address sets the tone for the rest of the event.  Only a few
 of the biggest names in the on-line world have had the honor of giving the
 keynote address at ONE BBSCON.  Below are the gentlemen who have had that
 distinction.

 ONE BBSCON '92 Keynote Speaker - John C. Dvorak
 ONE BBSCON '93 Keynote Speaker - Jim C. Warren
 ONE BBSCON '94 Keynote Speaker - Dennis C. Hayes

 The educational sessions are one of the major facets of ONE BBSCON and the
 number of sessions has more than doubled over the three year history of the
 event.  The sessions are arranged in tracks, which have evolved over the three
 conventions.  The BBS Software track has grown to include numerous BBS
 software packages, some of which people may not have heard of prior to the
 BBSCON.  The connectivity issues have evolved from sessions on how to hook up
 a BBS to the traditional BBS based networks like FidoNet, to numerous
 sessions on how to get hooked into the Internet.  Of course, there are some
 sessions which continue to be popular since the first BBSCON.  The How to
 Make Money with a BBS session, better known as the Jack and Phil show, is now
 a BBSCON tradition.  On-line legal expert Lance Rose headed up a track on the
 legal aspects of bulletin boards at the first ONE BBSCON, and this track has
 continued to expand with each ensuing convention.  Below are the approximate
 number of educational sessions which have been held at the previous events.

 ONE BBSCON '92 Educational Sessions - nearly 75
 ONE BBSCON '93 Educational Sessions - over 130
 ONE BBSCON '94 Educational Sessions - over 170

 The ONE BBSCON has grown up over the last three years and offers new and
 exciting things each year.  The trade show part of the event, the vendor
 exhibits, have grown in size each year.  It is possible that close to 200
 vendors could be displaying their products at the Tampa event.  But, BBSCON
 still remains reasonably priced.  ONE, Inc. has offered an early registration,
 for those who sign up prior to May 1, which has stayed at the same price the
 last two years.  While the registration fees have not been announced for ONE
 BBSCON '95, they are not expected to increase.  Below is what it cost for
 early registration over the first three events.

 ONE BBSCON '92 Early Registration - $125.00
 ONE BBSCON '93 Early Registration - $175.00
 ONE BBSCON '94 Early Registration - $175.00

 Perhaps, as the event continues to grow, the intimacy enjoyed at the early
 conventions held in mountains of Colorado will be treasured as the last
 bastions of on-line innocence.  There is little doubt, in the minds of most of
 those who have been lucky enough to attend a ONE BBSCON, that it is one of the
 friendliest conventions you will ever come across.  At ONE BBSCON '93, popular
 computer columnist John Dvorak joked that he could see a day when 15,000
 people would attend the event, which would make Jack Rickard a very rich man.
 His comment has the potential to become prophecy.

 Editor's Note:  The Pasco BBS Magazine will continue to cover the ONE BBSCON
 as it heads for the Tampa Convention Center August 16-20, 1995.  Look for more
 coverage of the most exciting event in the history of the Tampa Bay on-line
 community in next month's issue.

 Surfing the Boards
 ------------------

 Written by Paul Pollack, author of GamePlay, New Port Richey, FL
 Edited by Alex Thomas, editor of GamePlay, New Port Richey, FL

 Catchy title, huh?  Wasn't that punny?  OK, enough with the dumb jokes.
 Surfing the boards is an article about BBSs in general, with a special focus
 on electronic gaming.  Most of the information will be adequate wherever you
 live, but there may be an occasional note/emphasis about BBSs in my area (New
 Port Richey, FL).

 BBSs, or Bulletin Board Services, have caught on in a big way recently, and
 with the explosion of the Internet, more people are checking out BBSs than
 ever before.  But why should you and I care about this?  The answer is clear.
 BBSs are filled with tons of files, online games, doors, people to chat with,
 and much, much, more.  Since this (GamePlay) is a gaming magazine, I'll really
 concentrate on gaming, although there will be a significant amount of
 information about the other aspects too.

 BBSs offer a wide variety of service to basically anyone with a few
 peripherals.  To access the wide-world of BBSs you'll need a modem (it's
 almost a requirement these days to have a 2400, and a 14400 is a lot better),
 a computer, a telecommunications program, and a hard drive.  Actually, you
 don't need a hard drive, but else you really can't store many of the bigger
 programs that you download.  When you log onto a BBS, you're usually treated
 with an ANSI/RIP screen giving the name of the BBS, and asking for your
 name/handle and password.  First of all, most of you should be familiar with
 BBSs, if you're reading this you probably downloaded it from a BBS in your
 area or a major online service.  Just in case you're not familiar with a
 handle, a handle is an identity you take on a BBS that others on the BBS
 know you as.  Since I don't like getting complicated, my handle on most BBSs
 is simply Paul Pollack.  After that you enter your password and finally get
 onto the BBS.

 Once on to a BBS, the approach and software the BBS takes/uses varies widely.
 There are many BBS programs out there, ranging from the ever-popular Wildcat
 to the lesser-known VBBS (which was written in QB 4.5, for your information [I
 think]).  Usually, many of the latest versions of these BBS software programs
 include RIP graphics support, a type of graphical interface used to access the
 different functions of a BBS.

 But I've gotten ahead of myself.  I said to access a BBS you need a
 telecommunications program, a program that will allow you to use your modem
 to dial an online service.  There are many different telecommunications
 packages out there, and many excellent choices.  I recommend either of two
 excellent programs, Telix, and Ripterm.  Both Telix and Ripterm are easy
 to set up and use, with no frustrating and arcane commands.  Where Ripterm
 excels is in its ability to display RIP (short for ripscrip) graphics IF
 the BBS supports it.

 When you finally arrive at the main menu of a BBS there are many pathways that
 you could take.  On most BBSs there will be a file section, a message section,
 a doors/online games section, and a teleconference or chat section, not to
 mention a few sections unique to that particular BBS.  For our purposes we'll
 concentrate mainly on the doors/online games section and the file section, the
 chat section will be covered extensively in one of my other articles.  At the
 menu, you'll probably be asked to click on your choice (if it's a ripscrip
 screen) or to enter the first letter of your choice (if it's an ANSI screen).

 After going to the online games/doors menu, you'll see a number of Rip-based/
 ANSI based games, the most popular of which is TradeWars 2002.  Many online
 doors allow you to compete against other players, although not in real time.
 In the online games section you'll usually find all kinds of games, from
 trivia games like Star Trek trivia, to strategy games like Kannons (yes,
 that's how it's spelled) and Katapults. The games that aren't multiplayer
 either pit you against yourself (like the trivia games) or the computer (like
 the previously mentioned strategy games).  Many of the games are pretty fun,
 but the ANSI graphics that plague most of them will undoubtedly turn some
 folks off.  Now we move on to our main focus, the file section.

 In the file section of the BBS, you'll see a variety of software up for grabs,
 including some very good games.  Unfortunately, most of the files that are on
 BBSs aren't really that good (I could use other words, but I don't know who
 reads this magazine, therefore I won't), but many others are.  In fact, much
 of GamePlay magazine was created with freeware/shareware products.  If you
 have a modem, almost any shareware program imaginable can be found on one BBS
 or another.  Let's say you want to find an audio-CD player for your CD-ROM.
 Just go into your telecommunications program, dial up a local BBS, and search
 through the different areas and files available.  Chances are that at least
 one BBS in your area will have the files you're looking for.  I know that at
 least one board in my area has a few CD players to download.

 What else can you find on BBSs today.  Let's get back to our main focus,
 gaming.  On BBSs today there are all sorts of games on-line that range from
 great to not so great (I'm not going to start using expletives).  Some of the
 best games on BBSs are listed in my "Top 10" and "Best Commercial Game Demos"
 in the article menu, and I even have a mention of where to find many of my
 game add-ons.  On the other hand, many of the games that are out there on BBSs
 are so dated, that no one will ever download them.  On to the CD-ROM areas.
 On a CD-ROM you can store six-hundred megabytes of information, more than 400
 high-density disks!  Many times you'll find a ton of good shareware on these
 CDs, but the problem arises when a BBS keeps using an old CD-ROM.  Basically
 no one finds any new programs interesting on it, and it can't be updated since
 you can't write to a CD.  I've seen one CD that's been on the same BBS for a
 few years now and it dates back to before Windows 3.1 was released.

 What I find neat about the Board of Trade BBS and others like it is that you
 can perform a "Zippy Dir" scan which enables you to search all the directories
 for a game that has a description with those words in it.  Thus, if you wanted
 to find a neat 3D game, you'd go to the Zippy Dir scan and type 3D, then
 search all the directories.  I've done this a lot, but many of the games I've
 found are like "3-Demon," an old CGA "ten-step" Pac-man game.  Some games,
 like Billy the Kid, use 3D in the description but aren't 3D games at all.
 When you're downloading a game, remember that the author of the game is the
 one who probably uploaded it and typed in the description.  I know that I love
 GamePlay, but others may not think the description appropriate.  Shareware
 authors tend to hype their products, and you'll often find old EGA titles
 hidden underneath a great description.

 While on the subject of game descriptions, I'd like to bring up an interesting
 anecdote that happened to me on a BBS once.  I was on a BBS and I saw a game
 with a description that went something like this: "a game with good graphics."
 So, like a lot of other people (because it made the top downloads list, so I
 know I wasn't the only one fooled) I downloaded the program.  Unfortunately, I
 should have looked at the ZIP and guessed what it was and then I wouldn't have
 to go through this.  Anyway, it turned out to be Apogee's Word Rescue program
 meant for really young kids.  Think about it, Word Rescue got around thirty
 downloads just from putting a description of "a game with good graphics."  I
 oughta try that with GamePlay (just kidding).  Just keep in mind that the
 description the author gives you is not necessarily the correct description of
 the program, and that's one reason why GamePlay includes file descriptions and
 not just lists.

 Another nice aspect of BBSs is the teleconference available on multi-line BBSs
 which enable you to chat real-time between you and the other users.
 Unfortunately, even on a local BBS that said that it was for people of all
 ages, I found the people at the teleconference talking about some more
 (im)mature topics.  Let's just say that you wouldn't want your five-year old
 to hear it.  Some people in the teleconference aren't very mature at all
 mentally, and many of the people talking about these immature topics are still
 in school, which gives a horrific idea of the future of America.  One of the
 few things I do like about chatting on BBSs is that you don't take into
 account what the person looks like, you take into account how the person acts,
 and then, after meeting the person in real life, you actually know them, and
 you disregard the split-second subconscious judgements you make about how they
 look.

 On a related topic is chatting with the sysop, which can range from a fairly
 pleasant experience provided he's a nice sysop (Board of Trade, for example)
 to a downright ugly experience (I'm not going to mention any BBS for fear of
 being sued for this one).  On some BBSs, the sysop will make derogatory
 comments to you, and give you long explanations about why you can't even
 upload anything and then ask you to voice verify.  Most sysops are pretty much
 OK and shouldn't bother you too much, and most of the good conversation on
 BBSs are with the sysops rather than other users.

 But now the question everyone's has been waiting for:  What do I like in a
 BBS.  I'll give you an example and hopefully it'll answer the question.  I
 used to thoroughly enjoy calling a BBS called Gateways.  It, like all the BBSs
 I like, had a friendly sysop, lots of files, tons of doors, and well-split up
 file sections.  Not only did he have one for games, but one for top-10 games.
 Not only did it have online doors, but around forty of them.  There were a lot
 of neat files there, but since it wasn't receiving enough support, it closed
 down.  Nowadays I enjoy calling the Board of Trade BBS, available at (813)
 862-4772.  It has tons of games, doors, and is an official distribution sight
 for I don't know how many gaming companies (Apogee, ID, Epic MegaGames to name
 a few).  In case you didn't get the message, the main thing I look for in a
 BBS is the files, particularly updated and new files.

 All things considered, the world of BBSs is a compelling world, and one that's
 well worth the price of admission.  The games you play, the files you
 download, and most importantly, the people you meet all contribute to the BBS
 experience.

 Welcome to the second Hallway segment.  Thanks for reading it!  This month, we
 are reviewing Advanced Xoru by Castle Technologies.  We are planning on doing
 several role play games in a series.  The first was last month, in our first
 edition, the review of Mines of Gorr by S. Jibben.  Well, here's what we
 thought of Advanced Xoru.

 28.8, The New Modems Arrive
 ---------------------------

 When USRobotics released their new 28.8 Courier Dual Standards the Monday
 before ONE BBSCON '94, I was one of the hundreds of system operators who lined
 up to purchase them at the Sysop discounted price of $199 each.  The BBSCON
 ran August 17-21 and the modems were to be shipped within three or four weeks.
 My two brand new Duals were delivered on September 28, but there was no one
 home to sign for them, so I actually did not have them in hand until the next
 day.  When Sysops upgrade their modems, especially when doubling the speed
 from 14.4 to 28.8, it is one of the few times they can feel like a new user
 again.

 When I got home from work, I quickly opened the box containing one of the new
 modems.  Well, maybe not as quickly as I would have liked.  As any Sysop can
 tell you, there is plenty of daily maintenance which has to be done before any
 new projects can even be considered.  So, after answering mail, checking new
 files, upgrading new callers and all the rest, I could finally attack those
 FedEx packages.  I cast aside all the manuals and other stuff.  I wondered
 where the T-shirts were that, as I was promised by the USRobotics
 representative at ONE BBSCON, would be shipped with the modems.  I would worry
 about that later.  The box said plug it in and forget it.  Sounds good to me.
 I took the slow and laborious route of reading all the documentation prior to
 installing this substantial technological upgrade to my board.  Yea, right.
 Within minutes, I had the other box open, had one installed on my board and
 the other on my voice line and was calling my board.

 I called my BBS.  "CONNECT 14400."  Opps, better set that communications
 program to support the higher speed.  Try again.  "CONNECT 21600."  Fast, but
 not fast enough.  Hang up.  "CONNECT 28800."  Cool!  Still not as fast as the
 local mode, but a very noticeable increase in the display speed of the
 screens.  Cool!  Lets try a download and see this baby fly.  I want my
 3000cps!  Oh boy, that line had only been used for a 2400 baud modem and was
 not even grounded.  Errors, errors, errors.  Low cps, bummer.  Abort transfer.
 Need to work on eliminating the noise.

 How about trying to call another board with the BBS line itself.  Lets do it!
 Called Software Creations on their 28.8 rotary group.  "CONNECT 24600."  Not
 28.8, but lets see what happens.  Lets try to download the latest USBBS BBS
 List.  Errors, errors increasing, abort transfer, hang up, try again.  Second
 attempt, not any better.  Would I be reduced to reading the manual?  Not yet!
 For the most part modem manuals offer just general information, or technical
 specifications that only someone with a Masters in Modem Technology could
 understand.  No middle ground for the average Joe.  Most modem manuals are,
 for the most part, a waste of paper.

 Did manage to complete some error free downloads at 19.2, with a cps around
 1850, but that was the best at this stage of the game.  I left the new modem
 hooked up to the board and wondered when I would receive my first 28.8 call,
 not counting the couple of calls I had made myself.  Overnight someone had
 called and logged in at a connect speed of 21,600.  Obviously a V.FC or V.34
 caller, but the handshake had settled at a lower connect speed.  A file
 transfer was completed at a cps approaching 1900, but I did not know the
 number of errors the callers encountered.  Unfortunately, the caller did not
 leave any message about how the transfer went.  As I approached 28.8 day two,
 I knew my work was far from complete.

 The first, and most obvious, thing that had to be done was the upgrading of
 the UART chips.  A new high speed serial card was ordered, with 16550A UART
 chips, which were designed to correct the transfer error problems with the new
 28.8 modems.  Unfortunately, the part had to ordered and it would take several
 days to get the new serial card.  I hoped that this would do the trick and
 that additional tweaking would not be necessary.  I did take the opportunity
 to contact USRobotics about the missing T-shirts.  The woman on the other end
 of the phone said she had heard about people being promised shirts at the ONE
 BBSCON and that she'd get one shipped out to me.  I really should have gotten
 two, but I did not wish to make a big deal out of it.  I just wanted a USR T-
 shirt.  I asked for a size large and she said no problem.  I did receive the
 T-shirt, via Federal Express, before I got the serial card.  Hmm, size extra
 large.  Oh well, it was a nice looking shirt.

 The new serial card went in like a snap.  Tried another call, started a
 download, watched the cps go up, waited for errors.  No errors yet.  2500,
 2600, 2650 cps and still rising.  Got over 2700 with no errors!  Tried some
 other downloads, on other boards, and typically got 2700 or better cps.
 Someday soon, when I get a cleaner that average connection, I would not be too
 surprised to see the 3000 characters per second barrier broken.

 The BBS Glossary
 ----------------

 Access - To use a BBS, as in accessing, or the amount you can use it, as in
 access level.

 ANSI - While actually an acronym for the American National Standards
 Institute, it refers to the widely used graphics on BBSs.

 Archive - A file which has been compressed, or at least stored, under a
 specific name.  This allows for faster transfer times and the grouping of
 related files.  Originally meant for files with an .ARC extension.

 ASCII - An acronym for American Standard Code for Information Interchange
 which is the most common format for text files.

 Batch - A group of files which are either downloaded or uploaded, commonly
 called a Batch File Transfer.

 Baud Rate - The speed of the modem connection, the higher the rate the faster
 data travels.

 Bulletin - Text which the Sysop has made available to users.  Bulletins may be
 informational or educational, give the high game scores, or whatever the Sysop
 deems appropriate.

 Bulletin Board System (BBS) - A computer hooked up to a modem so that other
 people can call and access information, files or games.

 Bits Per Second (BPS) - The rate data is transmitted through a modem
 connection.  Increases with the baud rate.

 Caller - Someone who accesses a bulletin board from a remote location.

 Capture - Saving text from BBS display to a file on the remote computer
 normally in ASCII format.

 Chat - The ability to communicate with users on other lines (or nodes).
 Callers can chat back and forth in a live conversation.

 Communications Software - Computer program which allows for easier calling of
 BBSs.  Some software packages have all kinds of advanced features and many are
 quite easy to set-up.

 Compressed File - A file, or group of files, which have been reduced in size
 using compression utilities.  A compressed file uses less disk space and
 speeds up transfer times.

 Conference - A separate area on a BBS which is directed at specific topics.
 Conferences almost always have their own message base, and some have their own
 file directories or doors.

 CPS - Characters per Seconds.  A way to message the speed of data
 transmissions.  The CPS increases with the baud rate.

 Default - Refers to settings used by BBS or communications software.  Many
 times the preset configuration works fine, especially for new users.

 Door - A program with has been added onto the BBS, but is not part of the BBS
 software itself.  Sysops customize their board by adding game or utility type
 doors.

 Download - Receiving data from a BBS through the modem connection.  Downloads
 from BBSs are known as files.

 Drop Carrier - Hanging up on a BBS without following the proper log-off
 procedures.  Occasionally can happen on either end unintentionally.

 Echo Mail - Public messages which go out over a BBS network.

 E-Mail - Electronic mail, which is sent on computers in the form of messages.

 External Protocol - File transfer protocol which is not actually built into
 the particular BBS or communications software, but must be accessed
 externally.

 Fax/Modem - A modem which has the ability to send and receive facsimile
 transmissions (faxes).

 Fax Software - Software which works in conjunction with a Fax/Modem to send
 and receive faxes.  Many software packages have options such as converting
 faxes to ASCII or other text formats.

 FidoNet - The largest bulletin board based message network echoing mail with
 thousands of systems worldwide.

 File - Data transferred through the modem connection for use on the receiving
 computer.  Files can be complete programs, informational text, graphic images
 or many other formats.

 Freeware - Software which is legally copyrighted, however, the author asks for
 no monetary compensation for the program.

 HS/Link - This is a relatively new file transfer protocol.  It is a high
 speed, single and bi-directional file transfer protocol with many advanced
 features.

 Information Super-Highway - A buzz word created by the media to describe the
 current and future uses of telecommunications technology.

 Internal Protocol - File transfer protocol which is built into the particular
 BBS or communications software.

 boards, educational and government institutions, on-line services and
 businesses all over the world.  Millions of people are now accessing the
 Internet for electronic mail and other information.

 ISDN - Integrated Services Digital Network.  The next generation of telephone
 technology designed to provide real time transmission in a digital format.
 Already installed in some places.

 ITU-T - International Telecommunications Union (Telecommunications sector).
 Formerly known as CCITT, this organization sets the international standards
 for telegraphic and telephone equipment.  Sets modems standards, such as the
 recent V.34 standard for 28.8 baud transmissions.

 Line Noise - Static which can occur during a modem connection due to the fact
 that the telephone system was originally designed for voice.

 Local - Use of the BBS at it's physical location.  Typically, the Sysop
 accessing the BBS software directly.

 Log-on - Calling a BBS, and going through the most common procedure of giving
 name and password.

 Main Board - The primary conference on a BBS, and where the callers normally
 are when they first log-on.  Most general messages, files and doors should be
 found here.

 Message - Something left by a BBS user for others to read.  A message could be
 left for a single user, or for all users to read.

 Message Base - All messages left on a BBS, or more specifically the location
 of those messages.  Separate conferences typically have their own message
 base.

 Modem - Device which allows computers to talk to each other over a system
 which originally designed for voice.

 Network - Different BBSs exchanging messages to increase the activity and
 diversity of the message base.  The echo mail network allows a user to leave a
 message on one BBS which can be read on BBS at a different location.  On some
 of the large networks a message can be read literally around the world.

 NetMail - Electronic messages which go out over a BBS network which are
 addressed to, and may be read by, only one person.

 Node - Commonly used as the number of telephone lines hooked up to a BBS with
 each line being a node, but a BBS can also have local nodes.

 Password - A unique series of keyboard characters that a caller selects to
 access a BBS.  It should be kept confidential to prevent others from logging-
 on using your name.

 Paging - Requesting a live chat with the Sysop, who may answer the page if
 available.

 Private - Indicates a conference or message is not meant for all callers, and
 may refer to some BBSs which have restricted access.

 Protocol - A language that modems use to communicate with each other during
 file transfers.  The same protocol must be used by both modems for a transfer
 to be successful.  There are a growing number of protocols to choose from.

 Public - A conference, message or BBS which is open for any caller.  A public
 message can be read by all users.  A public board will have private messages
 and perhaps some private conferences, but generally access is available to
 all.

 Public Domain - Programs or files which are released free of charge with
 little restriction for use.

 Remote Computer - A computer which has connected to the BBS by modem.

 RIPscrip - Remote Imaging Protocol.  A graphics format which is used to add
 mouse support to bulletin boards.

 Script - A questionnaire set-up by the Sysop to get information from the
 caller.

 Security Level - Level of access given to a caller which determines what the
 caller may access on the BBS.  Users may require a higher security level to
 access certain conferences or files.

 Shareware - A method of software distribution which allows you to try before
 you buy.  Shareware can be used for a limited time without payment, but
 registration is required if the product is used past the evaluation period.

 Sysop - Short for System Operator, the person who operates the BBS.

 Transfer - The receiving or sending of a file with a BBS.

 Upload - Sending data, typically files, to a BBS through the modem connection.

 User - Originally meant to imply someone calling in the local mode, while
 those who access the BBS from a remote computer where known as callers.  Now
 commonly implies both callers and users.

 User Account - The record containing information for an individual user.
 Things like user name, password, address, the number of uploads and downloads,
 and security level are typically found in the user account.

 V.22 bis - An ITU-T standard for 2400 bps modem connections standardized in
 1984.

 V.32 - An ITU-T standard for 4800 and 9600 bps modem connections standardized
 in 1987.

 V.32 bis - An ITU-T standard for 14400 bps modem connections standardized in
 1991.

 V.34 - An ITU-T standard for 28800 bps modem connections standardized in 1994.

 V.FC - Early standard developed by Rockwell International for 28800 bps modem
 connections.

 Verification - Many BBSs have some way of verifying that the caller logging-on
 is actually who they say they are.  Caller ID, doors which call the user back,
 or calling all users by voice are common practices.

 Xmodem (CRC) -  At one time this was the most popular file transfer protocol.
 Xmodem (CRC) sends files in blocks of 128 characters at a time and checks for
 errors using a sophisticated Cyclic Redundancy Check.

 Xmodem (Checksum) - A file transfer protocol where information is transferred
 in 128 byte blocks with a less reliable Checksum error correction method.

 1K Xmodem - This file transfer protocol is a variation of Xmodem (CRC) that
 uses blocks that are 1 kilobyte (1024 bytes) in size.

 1K Xmodem/G -  This file transfer protocol variation of Xmodem is meant for
 error-free channels such as error correcting modems or direct cable links
 between two computers.  It achieves great speed, however, it does not have
 error correction and if an error occurs the transfer is aborted.

 Ymodem (Batch) - This file transfer protocol is a variation on 1K Xmodem,
 which allows for multiple files to be sent per transfer.  While transferring
 files it uses the 1024 byte block size and the CRC error correction method.

 Ymodem/G (Batch) - This file transfer protocol is a variation on Ymodem which
 achieves very high transfer rates by sending 1024 blocks without waiting for
 acknowledgment.  There is no error correction and if an error occurs the
 transfer is aborted.

 Zip - The most common form of compressed file found on BBSs.

 Zmodem (Batch) - This protocol is very popular because it is very fast,
 incredibly reliable and offers many features.  Zmodem can transfer files in a
 batch and can detect and recover from errors quickly.  The Zmodem Recovery
 feature can resume an interrupted transfer.
