 Exclusive Interview with Rocky Rawlins, National Coordinator ABBSA
 ------------------------------------------------------------------

 The American BBS Association is a new BBS advocacy organization which is only
 weeks old, but is taking off all over the country.  The organization was
 founded in response to media reports about bulletin boards, which contained
 misconceptions about the BBS community, and the ABBSA attempts to educate the
 public on just what is going on in the BBS community.  Since the BBS industry
 is young and rapidly growing such misconceptions could be quite detrimental if
 allowed to go unanswered.

 The American BBS Association has developed a set of ethical standards which
 all member boards must agree to, however, the organization has no interest in
 telling others how to run their boards.  The ethical standards are something
 which most Sysops should have no trouble adhering to, as they are already
 common practice on most of the better BBSes.

                 American BBS Association Ethical Standards

 1.  I will not use or allow my BBS to be used for illegal activity.

 2.  I will not allow my BBS to be used to distribute Pirated or Copyrighted
     software except where software Copyright and/or License agreements
     specifically allow electronic distribution and if such software is
     uploaded to my board without my knowledge I will remove it when I am made
     aware of it.

 3.  I will restrict access to adult material by minors and I will make all
     reasonable efforts to verify that a caller is 21 years of age before
     allowing that caller access to adult material.

 4.  If I run a Public BBS I will not refuse access to any individual on the
     basis of age, sex, religion, race, or ethnic origin except restrictions
     to specific conferences that are necessary to provide Private Conferences
     for particular age, sex, religious, racial or ethnic groups.

 5.  I will support and promote the Right of Freedom of Speech and the free
     exchange of ideas among individuals.

 Rocky Rawlins is the ABBSA National Coordinator and Sysop of a bulletin board
 which has been around since the early days of BBSing, The Matrix BBS in
 Birmingham, Alabama.  Rocky Rawlins agreed to a exclusive interview with the
 Pasco BBS Magazine.

 Pasco BBS Magazine (PBM):  What are some of the basic goals of the ABBSA?

 Rocky Rawlins (RR):  It really comes down to two or three items.  One, to put
 out a set of ethical standards that everyone can agree with and live with, and
 that we can let everybody know about.  Two is to educate the general public,
 teachers, parents, organizations and businesses about what BBSes really do.
 As opposed to what the public seems to think they do.  Third is to try to
 educate the media about what BBSes really do, as opposed to what they are
 often portrayed as doing.

 PBM:  Do you believe there are a lot of misconceptions about bulletin boards
 out there?

 RR:  Numbers of them.  Just in the past two months I've seen three different
 stories on network or local television about bulletin boards, and every one of
 them was rather sensational.

 PBM:  Do you think the media has a tendency towards sensationalism rather than
 telling both sides of the story?

 RR:  Possibly, but I'm inclined to think it is more a matter that most of the
 folks in the media are not even aware of the BBS community.  So it might not
 be purely sensationalism, but many of them are simply unaware of what is going
 on in the bulletin board world.

 PBM:  How were the ethical standards developed?

 RR:  Basically by sitting down with a group of the local Sysops here in town,
 and asking "what ethical standards do you currently abide by?"  We tried to
 look for the common denominators among the Sysops.  Certain things seemed to
 be common for all of the better Sysops.

 PBM:  What are the requirements for membership?

 RR:  Basically just read the ethical standards and sign them, and make all
 efforts to try and follow those ethical standards.

 PBM:  What other organization, if any, will the ABBSA work with to achieve its
 goals?

 RR:  I am not really sure, but I suppose we'll work with and be in contact
 with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and pretty much all bulletin board or
 electronic vocation organizations that we find.  But, we are really
 concentrating on local areas and there really isn't any other organization
 that we'll be working closely with.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation, and
 people like that are doing a wonderful job at the national level, but because
 they are concentrating all their resources and personnel at the national level
 they do not really have the resources to do anything at the local level.  The
 ABBSA is organized to create State Chapters which can take action and try to
 see some results at a local level in the towns in which the Sysops actually
 live.

 PBM:  This a relatively young organization, when did it start?

 RR:  Actually, about a month ago, maybe four or five weeks.  It has grown
 phenomenally already.  We have chapters, in about half the states right now.
 We have members in almost every state.  I think we are missing Alaska and
 Hawaii and possibly Minnesota, but that is about the only states we're missing
 at this point.  I've got about two inches of new applications which have come
 in the past week, and I haven't even had the chance to go through yet.  The
 response has been overwhelming, a much, much stronger response than we ever
 expected to get.

 PBM:  You had originally thought of doing this just on the local level?

 RR:  Originally the ABBSA was going to be the Alabama Bulletin Board
 Association.  Several of the Sysops raised the point there really needs to be
 something like this nationally, that every state should have something like
 that.  So, we decided to call it the American BBS Association and put
 information on some bulletin board networks to see if some other states would
 like to get involved in it too.  Within a week we where just being inundated
 with applications.  The response tells us that this is something which is
 badly needed throughout the country.  It seems to indicate to me that a lot
 other states, areas and cities are running into the same kinds of problems and
 misconceptions that we've been running into here.

 PBM:  It seems that you hit something at the right time.

 RR:  I think so.  Bulletin boards are becoming just visible enough now that
 they are beginning to get some press coverage and some publicity.  But the
 industry has not matured enough in the public eye that the general public and
 the media is really aware of what the bulletin boards are doing.

 PBM:  Tell us about the ABBSA related conference you offer on your board.

 RR:  What we're trying to do is run a national conference that all of the
 states can use to share ideas, concepts, approaches, techniques, things they
 find work in one area may work in another area, and so on.  Each state,
 depending on the state, may want a state conference for state ABBSA members.

 PBM:  You have said that the national organization would offer help and
 guidance, but the State Chapters would operate the way they would like to for
 their area.

 RR:  The State Chapters are pretty much independent.  There is no funding or
 cost involved in joining the ABBSA, so we don't have the personnel or
 resources to try to control this at the national level.  What we are going to
 try to do is simply coordinate the flow of information between the state
 chapters to insure that ideas which come up in one state get passed along to
 all the other states.  That is if someone comes up with a particular
 technique, approach or program which works well, we want everybody else to
 know about it.  They could have the chance to try it, or perhaps adapt it for
 their particular area.  We have already had cases were people have come up
 with ideas, but they didn't locally have the resources to carry it out, but
 someone in another state found it was very applicable to their area because
 they did have the resources to carry it out.  The flow of information, I
 think, is what really feeds the whole organization.

 PBM:  What do you see for the future of the ABBSA?

 RR:  The ideal situation would be the ABBSA to totally disappear because there
 was no longer any need for it.  I suspect ten to fifteen years from now there
 will not be any need for something like the ABBSA, because the concept of
 bulletin boards and on-line communications will be such a household word that
 everyone will be aware of what it is and what it does, so there wont be any
 need to educate the public because the public will know.  The problem right
 now is that there are so many misconceptions, misinformation and lack of
 information that somebody has to provide it.  Fifteen years from now, I don't
 think that is going to be a problem.

 RR: The Matrix BBS has been around for quite awhile, could you give some
 history?

 RR:  Well, it started up in either 1980 or 1981, I honestly don't remember
 which at this point.  It started with an XT, a little 1200 baud modem and ten
 meg drive and has been on-line continuously since then, under one name or
 another.  We changed names a couple of times along the way.  We used to be
 America On-Line and we sold that name to the folks that use it now.  In those
 eleven or twelve years, whatever it has been, we've grown to 23 or 24 nodes,
 about five gigabytes, so we've turned into a pretty large board.  It has taken
 over a pretty good portion of the house.

 PBM:  Do you consider yourself to be one of the BBS pioneers?

 RR:  Apparently I am.  I wasn't really aware of it until I went to the BBSCon
 last year.  They had people standing up and started sitting them down, from
 the youngest board to the oldest boards, and when they got back to the early
 days there was only about ten of us standing.  I was rather surprized.  I
 hadn't really thought about it until then.

 PBM:  Do you have any idea of who has been with you since day one?

 RR:  Yes, there are a number which have been on there since the very early
 days.  In fact, one of the people who was one of the first callers, that first
 week the board was first up, is now one of the Sysops on the board.  Right now
 we have about 3,600 regular users.

 PBM:  What changes do you feel have led to the growth in the BBS industry?

 RR:  Two real changes.  One, the hardware and software have matured to the
 point where systems are very stable, very robust and very secure.  The second,
 the advent of echo-mail and mass-communications networks, where a user can
 leave a message on a board and a day later it can echoed on boards literally
 around the world.

 The American BBS Association's National Office address is at 1416 11th Street
 South, Birmingham, AL  35205.  The Matrix BBS can be reached at (205) 323-2016
 or (205) 323-6016.  The National Office can also be reached by voice at (205)
 323-6608.  There are informational packages available around the country on
 bulletin boards which give the details on how to contact the State Chapters.

 Thank you to Rocky Rawlins for the interview, and for undertaking such an
 enormous task to help the BBS community.

 Archive Comparison
 ------------------

 The .ZIP format archive has been the standard compression method used on
 bulletin boards since the initial release of the Shareware program in 1990.
 The confusion which surrounded the recent release of PKZIP 2 has lead some to
 suggest that maybe other formats would gain some inroads into the archive
 market.  It seems that the smoke has cleared, with PKWARE feverishly working
 to fix the earlier problems, and the .ZIP format will remain the industry
 standard.  While many Sysops are still waiting to switch to the new format,
 the conversion now seems inevitable.

 There are only a few archive formats which have gained any notoriety in the
 attempt to unseat the .ZIP archive.  No one has gained more than limited
 success in the competition.  The .ARC format, which is short for archive, was
 the first created to reduce the size of files on bulletins boards.  It was
 discovered early that files would take quite some time to download using the
 slower modems of that time.  Remember, there were computer experts who felt
 data could never transmitted at speeds over 2400 baud through telephone lines
 designed for voice.  Phil Katz improved on the .ARC format and the end result
 was the .ZIP format.  Of course, the other technology has improved as well.

 This comparison does not claim to be a scientific experiment in compression
 ratios, but looks at some results of the more popular archive programs
 available on bulletin boards today.  The comparison was made using the default
 settings for each program, as this is what most people would be using anyway.
 The latest version commonly available on BBSes was used, even if some versions
 had not been updated recently.  The old and new versions of PKWARE were both
 used do to the recent interest.  Two version of the .ARJ format were used
 since the beta test release has been out for some time now.  The two files
 used for the comparison were the March issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine and
 Sports Trivia by Software Creations.  This way a file which was ANSII text and
 a file containing several formats could be averaged.  The table gives the size
 after compression and the percentage of compression performed on the file, the
 total is simply the average of the two files.  All figures are rounded to the
 nearest hundredth.

 The object was to show compression ratios only, so let others argue that some
 programs may have more features or are faster.  On bulletin boards the size of
 the file is the main concern for those with slower modems or calling long
 distance.

 Guest Feature

 The Game Factor, by Alberto Able, Editor of Lore & Legends, Port Richey, FL

 One problem that role-players encounter is they can usually never find a group
 to play with.  This is usually the biggest problem one can face when one gets
 into role-playing games.  But it is a problem to be reckoned with.

 Well, within the last couple of years, computers are starting to be the
 alternative to playing with a group.  You have out on the market the 'gold
 box' AD&D computer games, the Ultima series of fantasy games, and the father
 of all RPG computer games, the Wizardry series.  Plus with this selection, you
 can also include the various Shareware/freeware games out there on the market.

 But still, with such games an element is missing from them.  Not even the most
 advanced home computer games can take over.  You see, one reason most people
 play RPGs, other than to have fun, is to be with friends, to meet people.  And
 surely you can't be friends with your computer (and if you do, you really need
 to get out more.)

 But now, BBSes are jumping onto the RPG bandwagon.  They are starting what I
 prefer to call Play-By-E-Mail RPGs, or PBEM.  This is more of a offshoot of
 PBM games (play-by-mail), in which people use the Postal Service and play with
 people all over the country, and perhaps all over the world.

 PBEM are different, as most of you fellow BBSers know, a BBS consists of
 mainly three things: a files base, game doors, and a message base.  PBEM games
 use the message base instead of the Postal Service.  And as most of you BBSers
 know already anyway, the message base in a BBS is much faster and more
 reliable than the mere insignificant Postal Service (no offense intended).

 But the question comes to mind, "What games does one play by PBEM?"  Well, in
 fact, anything you can think of. The games range from Dungeons & Dragons to
 war simulations.  It just all differs according to the BBS.

 Take for example some of the BBSes in my area. The Round Table BBS is offering
 an AD&D game, a Paranoia game, and an X-Men game (there may be one more, but I
 only remember that which interests me).  I have only seen the AD&D game in
 progress (at the writing of this report, I am in the process of getting into a
 game) but it was rather exciting.  The main elements of a RPG game were there,
 and maybe as technology increases we may be able to see who we're playing with
 through the computer screen (remember, these games take place over message
 bases).

 But AD&D games aren't the only games you can play.  Another BBS, called
 Virtual Realm, offers Shadowrun (a very good game I may add).  And I may also
 add that both Game-Masters (the guys who run the games) are also very
 competent about the games.

 Ah, but I can go on and on... I can write a book about the subject, but this
 magazine needs room for more important articles.  I leave you with this...  as
 all RPG games go, a PBEM game is the best alternative when you're not able to
 find someone to play with.  But, there are certain more 'interactive' games
 out there to play.  More graphics, more sound, more etc.  And with that in
 mind, I leave you hanging, so then you can maybe pick up the next issue and
 see if the next article I may write is about those 'other' games. <grin>

         <and if Rich doesn't cut this out... read Lore & Legends>

 Rusty & Edie's BBS Back On-Line, Charges Pending

 Rusty & Edie's BBS is back on-line after the highly publicize bust on January
 30, 1993.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted the raid on the
 Boardman, Ohio bulletin board because it had allegedly been distributing
 copyrighted software programs.  A press release, put out by the Software
 Publishers Association (SPA), in last month's issue described the details of
 the bust.  The SPA investigates complaints by software companies that their
 programs are being distributed illegally.

 The raid, press release and subsequent delay in filing charges has lead to
 some mixed responses in the on-line community.  Many have praised both the FBI
 and SPA for their active role in pursuing the distributors of illegal
 software.  Bulletin Boards which distribute software illegally are hurting the
 entire BBS industry, and as such, should be prosecuted to the full extent of
 the law.  However, some have said since no charges have been filed it boils
 downs to just plain harassment.  To clear up some of the confusion, the Pasco
 BBS Magazine contacted Ilene Rosenthal, general counsel for the SPA, to
 discuss just these issues.

 When asked of how the SPA got involved in the FBI investigation Ms. Rosenthal
 explained how that developed.  "The SPA has a very active anti-piracy program.
 Our members and the user community report to us organizations or bulletins
 boards that are pirating their software.  We investigate and either bring a
 civil action on behalf of the members of our industry whose software is being
 pirated, or alternatively, if it is a case which is criminal we will go to the
 FBI and show them the evidence which we've amassed and ask them whether or not
 this was the type of case they would be interested in taking.  In this
 particular case we went to the FBI and asked them if they were interested, and
 it turns out they had their own investigation going as well.  So, we ended up
 coordinating and working to the extent that we could provide them with
 information.  We ended up working with them in that regard."

 When asked about those who felt it was harassment, simply because no charges
 have been filed, she explained "it is the FBI, not the SPA who is doing the
 investigation, but it is not unusual.  Before an indictment comes down there
 is always very, very careful work done on the part of federal authorities.  I
 don't think that is unusual at all.  There is a time element.  It is not
 unusual that a search warrant is executed and at a later date people are
 charged.  People don't get arrested until very thorough work and investigation
 are completed.  My own personal feeling is that people are probably jumping
 the gun here.  It is interesting, because the on-line which I have been
 looking at has been much more favorable then what you have just indicated."

 Ilene Rosenthal is right when she states that software piracy on bulletins
 boards "does hurt the BBS industry and the legitimate Sysops, which is really
 the saddest thing."  We also thank her for here time and will have more on the
 Software Publishers Association in next month's issue.

 Unnamed Winter Storm Wrecks Havoc on BBS Community
 --------------------------------------------------

 It is really an insignificant part of the killer winter storm which left a
 path of destruction along the eastern United States, but an impact was felt on
 the BBS community.  The March surprise caused extensive damage to power and
 telephone lines as hurricane strength winds ripped through almost half of the
 states in the union.  Nearly a million customers lost electrical power along
 the east coast.

 Here along Florida's west coast, Pasco County was hit as hard as anybody and
 declared a disaster area by the Federal government.  The local telephone
 exchange of the Pasco BBS Magazine was completely out for a day as flood
 waters forced the shut-down.

 People calling bulletins boards throughout the east found busy signals and
 ring-through, and other weather related problems.  But again, this was minor
 considering the storm claimed a couple hundred lives.

 Editorial
 ---------

 Who is responsible for scanning files for viruses?

 The chance of finding a virus in a computer program may be remote, but all
 users should realize there is a chance.  Millions of computer programs are
 purchased or downloaded each year and a viruses is rarely encountered.  Most
 bulletin board operators check every file before making them available to
 users and commercial software developers are also cautious.  It is also
 foolish to assume that commercial "shrink-wrap" software is virus free, as
 many retails do re-sell returned software.  In reality, commercial software
 dealers and retailers do not take viruses as seriously as BBS Sysops, so their
 record is nothing to brag about.

 Most bulletin boards do warn users that all files are provided "as it," so as
 to limited their own liability.  But who is responsible for scanning your
 programs for viruses?  Who is responsible for assuring that the programs you
 use on your computer do not contain harmful viruses which may cause
 catastrophic damage to your system?

 Whose fault is it if you get ill because you fail to cook your meat
 thoroughly?  Whose fault is it if you have serious injuries sustained in
 automobile crash, despite the fact you neglected to wear your seat belts?
 Whose fault is it you do not read the labels on medicines or toxic substances?
 Whose fault is it if you are burglarized because of an unlocked door?  Whose
 fault is it if your pet is run over by a car?  Whose fault is it if you smoke
 cigarettes and are diagnosed with lung cancer?

 I think you get the point.  You have to be responsible for your own actions
 and not take senseless chances.  Perhaps society in general would also benefit
 if people would take responsibility instead of blaming others.  Only one
 person can be responsible for scanning for viruses, and that person is you.

 Trivia Shell Review
 -------------------

 Dan Linton and Jason Blochowiak have teamed up to create a very enjoyable
 Shareware trivia game.  Trivia Shell has all kinds of features and a growing
 number of question databases, which makes it fun and educational no matter
 what your interests are.

 Trivia Shell has many options which the player can choose from, so the game
 can be set-up to your own personal preferences.  You can choose which level of
 play, or how difficult you want the questions to be, which makes it fun for
 the entire family.  There is also a humor mode which will make comments on
 your play.  The game can be set-up for timed play, to repeat questions
 answered incorrectly, to give the correct answer if you miss a question or to
 allow hints.

 There are currently twenty-five different question databases available for
 Trivia Shell.  There is TV Trivia, Kids Trivia, Presidents Trivia, Sports
 Trivia, World War II Trivia, to name a few.  The Shareware version offers 105
 questions for each game, but registration brings 300, 600, or in the case of
 some titles, 1000 questions, depending on which level of registration you
 prefer.

 Trivia Shell is well done, and if you are not careful you may learn something.

 More BBS Symbols
 ----------------

 A couple of issues ago, some of the more common BBS symbols were run in the
 magazine.  Some users like to add symbols to messages to convey some sense of
 feeling.  Some think of them as emotional icons, or "emoticons."  You have
 most likely seen things like :-) (the smiling happy face) in BBS messages.
 Some of the other symbols are far more complex and not so self explanatory.
 Here are more BBS symbols.  It might help to turn your head, as most symbols
 are on their sides.

 #:-)    :-) done by someone with matted hair
 @=      Flame about nuclear war (mushroom cloud)

 TheDraw Review
 --------------

 TheDraw is an excellent drawing program, allowing almost anyone to become a
 computer artist with little effort.  It is more than a basic screen drawing
 utility.  The Shareware program has easy access to oversize letters and
 graphics characters.  TheDraw saves to numerous formats including a .COM file
 to display your work with ease.

 TheDraw works well with text files, saving to the ASCII format.  Artwork can
 be also be created in full ANSI color.  The animation feature makes
 professional looking graphics animation easy, and is great for presentations.
 Programmers may formulate screens in BASIC, Turbo Pascal, C, Object and
 Assembler formats.  The newest version allows Sysops to design screens and
 save to PCBoard and Wildcat color code form.

 TheDraw is extremely versatile, while remaining simple to use.  It is a real
 time saver for those who need to design graphics screens.

 BBS Basics
 ----------

 Messages, Conferences and Networks

 The last few issues brought us to the point where the discussion begins on
 what is available on bulletin board systems.  We know now what a BBS is and
 how to call for the first time, so let's move on to the discussion on
 messages.

 Unfortunately, a large percentage of today's bulletin board callers are not
 interested in reading messages.  They are more likely to be calling for files
 or to play on-line games.  However, the callers who have been at this awhile
 can remember when BBSes offered little else, and they still maintain an
 attraction for reading messages.  In the early days there was nothing called
 Shareware or the wide variety of game doors that are now available.  Yes, the
 BBS pioneers called primarily to talk to each other and to this day messages
 remain a major part of BBSing.

 In the simplest form, a message is left on a bulletin board system so another
 user may read it and reply.  A private message is left for just one person and
 no one else can read it.  It should be noted that you should never leave
 something in a message which you would be afraid to have someone else read, as
 there is no such thing as a truly private message.  Sysops can read messages
 or someone could download the message file, or capture file, and possibly read
 all messages.  Public messages are more fun, as everyone who accesses the
 system may read and maybe respond to the message.  Some systems may have quite
 a few messages and some messages may have been left some time ago, leaving a
 sort of system history.

 The problem with having numerous messages is that they may vary considerably
 as to topic, thus making the user have to wade through all the messages to
 find those which interest them.  This is how the idea of conferences came into
 being.  By having users enter messages in conferences, which pertain to a
 particular subject, all similar messages are grouped together.  BBSes may have
 a "for sale" conference, "teen" conference or "sports" conference.  This way
 the users know where to go for messages which interest them.  The problem is
 that once the messages are separated into all the different conferences, there
 may be very few messages in each conference.  This is what brought about the
 development of networks.

 By linking computers together by networks, a message on one system is "echoed"
 to other systems.  Bulletin boards may choose to have network conferences,
 which pertain to whatever subjects the Sysop feels the users will enjoy the
 most, so that messages originally left on more than one system may be read.
 This way the advantage of having specialized conferences is not hampered by
 having very few messages to read.  Another advantage of networks is that a
 user can leave a message on their local BBS for someone in another area, and
 thus avoid the long-distance telephone charges.  Some echo-mail networks are
 huge with thousands of systems all over the world.  But to be a network all it
 really takes is two BBSes and many networks start out this way.  Thousands of
 boards are calling each other, normally in the middle of the night, to
 transfer mail.  Most boards are "nodes" which call the particular network
 "hub," so messages can be received from a common place.  Larger networks may
 have "regional hubs" because the "network hub" could not handle all the
 systems calling each night.

 Next month the discussion moves on to what has become the most popular feature
 in the world of BBSing, files.

 Corrections and Clarifications
 ------------------------------

 In last month's interview with Dan Linton a company working on a new game for
 Apogee Software was mistakenly referred to as the Jail Group.  This new
 company's name is actually the JAM Group.  Sorry for any confusion this may
 have caused.
