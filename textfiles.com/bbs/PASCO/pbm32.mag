 Editor's Welcome
 ----------------

 Welcome to another issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine!

 This month we look back at an educational session from last summer's ONE
 BBSCON, with an article about Wolfgang Stiller and his Integrity Master
 program.  His discussion about of some of the myths about computer viruses is
 particularly interesting.  Speaking of ONE BBSCON, we continue our extensive
 coverage of ONE BBSCON '95, which is coming to Tampa in August.  This month
 we take a look at the site for the event, with an article entitled Tampa
 Convention Center - Facts and Figures.  Paul Pollack writes about Cyberspace
 and Online Gaming, and Shawn Berg editorializes about Net Worth.  Thanks for
 the articles guys!  This issue also has all our regular features, including
 PBM Flashback and another extraction from ROTFL Digest!

 Hope you enjoy this month's issue and thanks for reading!

 Wolfgang Stiller - The Integrity Master
 ---------------------------------------

 Wolfgang Stiller is a German born anti-virus expert who first released his
 popular Integrity Master program in 1990.  At last summer's ONE BBSCON in
 Atlanta he hosted an educational session which touched on a wide range of
 issues related to data integrity.  He discussed various threats to data and of
 some of the more common myths about viruses.  What follows are some of the
 highlights of what turned out to be a very interesting and educational
 session.

 "A virus is just one threat to your data," Wolfgang Stiller began.  "There are
 many treats.  There are hardware problems, or the power can drop out at the
 wrong time and damage your executables and your data.  Viruses are a subset of
 the software problem area.  There are all kinds of software problems and many
 times they can look like a virus.  These are the ones which are most difficult
 to defend against."  He talked about a very common, but often overlooked
 source of viruses.  "Beware the repairman.  You call the guy and say my PC is
 not booting, or its doing flaky things, the first thing he is going to do is
 pop a diskette in your A drive and boot it.  That diskette has probably
 visited a dozen other PCs in the last 24 hours.  Be real careful after your
 repairman visits your PC, do a quick check on the thing to make sure that he
 hasn't left anything behind."

 The session continued with a discussion of the different types of viruses.
 "Logic bombs are basically something destructive, or something malicious, or
 sneaky hidden within a legitimate program.  A trojan is really a specific type
 of a logic bomb that is embedded in something which appears to be legitimate.
 Sometimes trojans are originally drawn up as an ASNI program.  Back in the
 early days people would just take FORMAT.COM and put a little front end in
 there to run it, or a batch file, and format your disk.  Upload it and say
 this is a neat game, as soon as your run it, you format your disk.  That is
 really not a logic bomb, just a destructive program that somebody's claiming
 is useful.  These are not that big of problem, in general, because they will
 not spread.  You can't imagine a BBS Sysop getting something like that
 uploaded and giving it to somebody else.  You're not likely to encounter too
 many of those.  They are more of an issue on networks, the Internet worm is
 the most famous example."

 "Viruses are different because they spread from one host program to another.
 A virus can't exist only by itself, its got to have something to infect, its
 got to have a host program to attach itself to.  What is a virus.  Viruses are
 not some mysterious thing that you have to be a genius to write, or really
 sharp to understand.  They're really simple things.  Especially nowadays when
 there are a lot of so-called virus writers who do not really understand what
 they are writing, they run these canned tools that kick out assembly language,
 that if they're lucky they can get to assemble.  Half the time they don't run
 correctly, but they upload them to somebody's board and we have to scan for
 them.  There are a lot of junk virus writers out there."

 "A virus is a program that replicates by attaching versions of itself to other
 programs.  The piece of code that is attached is not always the same.  When
 the program is executed, the virus code executes first.  That is generally the
 way it is done.  It executes along with the legitimate code.  Virus code
 executes, legitimate code executes, the user doesn't see anything wrong.  The
 virus then infects other programs.  Ultimately, the goal of the virus is to
 infect more programs, otherwise it wouldn't be a virus.  Some viruses all they
 do is go resident in memory the very first time and once the virus is resident
 in memory it can infect programs whenever it feels like.  A lot of viruses
 infect any program that you look at.  So, if your scanner does not recognize a
 virus and the virus has infected the scanner, which has happened many times in
 the past, every file scanned may become infected."

 Wolfgang Stiller also talked about some of the virus myths that have been
 circulated for years.  To this day, BBS Sysops still have to fight with these
 perceptions.  "Virus myths and mythical sources, this is one that hurts a lot
 of us that trying to make a living in this business.  I started off marketing
 my product through the Shareware route.  I've had people interested before in
 my product and they find out it is available on BBSs, or its Shareware, and
 the corporate door slams shut in my face.  This is largely due to publicity
 that was done early on by one particular anti-virus vendor, who also got his
 start in Shareware, who basically put out a list of things to do.  And on that
 list, that was basically duplicated in the press, was avoid BBSs, avoid
 Shareware and Public Domain software.  There is absolutely no fact behind that
 at all.  It just seemed to make sense, well, gee, share files, Shareware,
 that's got to be bad.  Oh, BBSs, there are files available for download,
 dangerous stuff.  Absolutely no fact.  I mean, obviously, any time you get
 some code it could have a virus in it.  BBSs, Shareware and Public Domain
 software are no more likely to have a virus than going off to your retail
 store.  As a matter of fact, the statistics I've seen show the opposite.
 Retail stores frequently take software back, re-shirk wrap it when its been
 returned, and other unsavory practices that can spread viruses.  Of course,
 major software manufacturers have shipped viruses straight from the factory.
 The U.S. Census Bureau sent an infected disk out with CD-ROM they had.
 Practically all the major manufacturers at some point in time have made a
 slip-up.  It is very easy to do, it doesn't mean that they are bad companies,
 or anything like that.  There is no absolutely safe source, you can get it
 many places."

 Wolfgang Stiller elaborated on the fact that on-line sources are just as safe,
 perhaps safer, than other sources.  "On the whole BBS Sysops are very virus
 aware.  The on-line services are generally very virus aware, using multiple
 scanners.  It is very unlikely to get one there.  Computer store personnel,
 there are exceptions, mostly they are not very virus aware.  They sometimes
 accept returns.  I've never heard of a computer store that scanned its
 software."

 He also passed along some advice on which type of virus scanners were the best
 ones to use.  "Resident scanners are not as effective as the non-resident
 ones.  That type of scanning technology can be disabled by a virus."

 Wolfgang Stiller has done fairly well with Integrity Master.  Those who
 purchase the anti-virus program receive a book called "Defeating Viruses and
 Other Threats to Data Integrity."  The first half is the "Integrity Master
 Users Guide" and the second half is about "Data Integrity and Viruses."  The
 book makes for very interesting reading, covering topics such as, Threats to
 your Data, Protection for your PC, Virus Myths, Virus Realities and the latest
 information on viruses.

 Cyberspace and Online Gaming
 ----------------------------

 Written by Paul Pollack, author of GamePlay, New Port Richey, FL
 Edited by Alex Thomas, editor of GamePlay, New Port Richey, FL

 It's one of those over-used buzz-words everyone uses but no one understands.
 No, I'm not talking about the information superhighway or interactive movies,
 I'm talking about Cyberspace, the premiere buzz-word of the '90s.  It's been
 talked about by some of today's most influential game designers, and I feel
 it's time to shed some light on the mystery.

 What is Cyberspace?  Imagine this scenario:  You're talking with your friends.
 Let's call them Bob, Katie, and Frank.  You whisper something to Bob, and he
 breaks out laughing.  Bob and Katie can't hear you.  Little do you know that
 Bob and Katie are whispering to each other.  Suddenly, a fly lands on your
 keyboard and you're brought back to reality.

 What I've just told you about is one of the simplest forms of Cyberspace, a
 form you can experience on any BBS with a teleconference feature.  In the
 example I just gave, you were in a place.  Not a physical place like your
 local library, school, or museum, but nonetheless a place.  Congratulations on
 your first trip into the wonderful world we in the trade call Cyberspace.  But
 Cyberspace isn't always used to refer to BBS chatting and teleconferencing.
 In fact, most of the uses of the word Cyberspace deal with VR, or Virtual
 Reality.  Most people think of Cyberspace as the virtual world that you're
 immersed in.

 One of the best places to experience Cyberspace right now, without going
 broke, is on The ImagiNation Network, an online service founded by Sierra On-
 line.  What ImagiNation does is allow people a chance to talk, chat, gamble,
 and even kill each other in the fantastic online games available.  For
 example, in Sierra's online FRPG, the Shadow of Yserbius, you converse,
 attack, or join other people in your quest to learn the secrets and solve your
 quest.  In fact, some people, such as Ken Williams himself, would argue that
 the conversation and social interaction between others is even more important
 then the actual game itself.  When you think about it, it's a lot more fun to
 play a game with two, three, or four people rather than playing alone.  The
 ImagiNation Network is a true example of Cyberspace and allows you to simply
 live another life.

 I could go on and on about the features of the ImagiNation Network, from the
 facemaker to the ever popular Red Baron to the marriages occurring because of
 the network.  In fact, Rush Limbaugh even met his future wife on an online
 service (though not INN).  I could talk about the great chat capabilities and
 all the nice features, and how INN has really evolved over the past few years
 from it's Sierra Network beginnings, but I won't.  Instead, I'll talk about
 one of the benefits(?) of Cyberspace.

 Let's go back to a previous example I used earlier in the article.  I talked
 about how Bob, Katie, Frank and you were talking and whispering to each other.
 Suppose you're chatting with these people on a BBS and you've never met them
 in real life.  Since many BBSs let you use handles, you don't know these
 people's real names and many times you'll never know.  So Bob, Katie, Frank
 could be simply handles on BBSs.  Who knows?  Bob and Frank could be girls,
 while Katie could be a boy.  Let's suppose that you're chatting with these
 people and you get into an interesting discussion and you find out that
 someone there, let's say Frank, shares the same point-of-view as you do.
 Instead of judging someone by how they dress or their physical appearance, you
 judge them by their personality and what's inside.

 Admit it.  Within seconds of meeting someone, you start to form opinions about
 that person based on stereotypes that society has fed you.  Because someone
 has a different haircut or dresses differently often will turn you off before
 you get a chance to really know the person.  But once you actually understand
 a person, you don't really care what gender, race, or appearance they possess,
 you just know how they are.  But isn't this benefit hampered once you're on
 the INN?  After all, don't people know how you look from you're face you
 created?  Not necessarily.

 When you get right down to it, your basic persona and face that you create can
 be totally off-base.  You can modify yourself on INN, or completely change
 your sex while online.  You know that everyone you meet's face or gender could
 be a complete facsimile, and so you still don't judge anybody from the way
 they look.  I like chatting with other mature people without having to worry
 about whether or not they'll make fun of my appearance, or make derogatory
 comments about me based on how I dress.

 So now you know what Cyberspace is, now let's get into the gaming aspect of it
 all, online games.  While INN is great for games, you can find some great
 games all over the country on local BBSs.  Earlier I mentioned that playing a
 game with/against two, three, four or five people is more fun than playing
 alone or against the computer.  But why is it more fun?

 This leads to a rather obvious answer:  People love company and cyberspace is
 a gateway toward it.  In Cyberspace you lead a virtual life in a virtual
 world, whether it be in the world of INN or the world of Neverwinter Nights
 (the D&D based America Online title).  And just like in a real world, there
 are real people.  I like stand alone games as much as the next guy, but
 getting the same responses and figuring out the characters' one sided
 personalities gets boring after a while.  After all, it's much more fun when
 you can identify with a character.  When you're in Cyberspace in an
 interlinked virtual world, you have the opportunity to talk to real people
 connected to you through your computer or other device.

 Another reason that playing with or against a friend is more fun is that you
 can figure a computer out.  After playing the same flight sim for a few
 hundred times, you learn the computer's algorithm.  When you beat the
 computer, you know that you really didn't beat anybody real, just the opponent
 the programmers designed.  But when you're flying a Sopwith Camel and shoot
 down someone else, you know that there's someone else flying that plane.  And
 that's a rewarding experience!  I could give examples from any genre, from
 resource management to arcade/action, but I think you get the picture.
 Working with friends and other people gives a new dimension to a game, the
 human factor.  And the human factor has much more personality and
 unpredictability of any computer algorithm.

 Where can I "jack in" to Cyberspace right now?  If you want to spend some time
 in a few "virtual worlds" you could try a BattleTech center or a Virtual World
 amusement park, but for those looking for a casual alternate universe to spend
 some time in, the forementioned INN makes a great choice.  Not only does it
 offer chat sessions and allow you to make more friends than you ever imagined,
 it has some of the hottest multiplayer titles around.  For those who wish to
 sample Cyberspace before logging on to an expensive online service, or for
 those nervous about giving out your credit card number, you can sample
 Cyberspace on your local BBS.  Most BBSs nowadays have at least a few online
 doors where users often compete with each other to conquer the galaxy, build
 an empire, or just play an old fashioned game of Solitaire.  So no matter what
 you're cup of tea is, you can find it cruisin' through Cyberspace.

 Tampa Convention Center - Facts and Figures
 -------------------------------------------

 The Tampa Convention Center, located in downtown Tampa, has been selected as
 the site for ONE BBSCON '95.  As part of our ongoing comprehensive coverage
 leading up to the event, this month the Pasco BBS Magazine takes a look at
 this beautiful facility.

 The multi-purpose Tampa Convention Center, owned and operated by the City of
 Tampa, was built at a cost of $140 million and had its official grand opening
 on October 19, 1990.  The building features 600,000 square feet of functional
 space with all the amenities to host an event of this magnitude.  With the
 extensive use of maple trim, large mosaic tile renderings and plush patterned
 carpet, this meeting center is definitely state of the art.  The location, at
 the mouth of the Hillsborough River, provides a wonderful setting.
 Considering the 2,000 feet of waterfront view, Riverwalk session rooms and
 outdoor patios, it would be difficult to find a more attractive place to hold
 a convention.

 Some of the facts and figures on the Tampa Convention Center follow.

 Editor's Note:  The Pasco BBS Magazine will continue extensive coverage
 leading up to ONE BBSCON '95, the most significant event in the history of the
 Tampa Bay on-line community, in next month's issue.  A future issue will also
 take a closer look at the Convention Center-Harbour Island-Franklin Street
 area, so visitors will be able to have a better idea of just how suited this
 area is to hosting these types of events.

 PBM Flashback - February 1994
 -----------------------------

 Ten years ago next month, the Inner Sanctum BBS went on-line in West Pasco
 County.  Rob Marlowe, Sysop of Pasco's oldest BBS, wrote about "Pasco
 BBSing...The Early Years" in an article for the February 1994 issue of the
 Pasco BBS Magazine.  It is interesting to note how much things have changed
 over the last ten years, especially when compared to this day of 28.8 modems
 and gigabyte hard drives.  Here is some of what Rob Marlowe had to say about
 the earliest days of bulletin boards in Pasco County.

 "The Inner Sanctum BBS went on-line on March 8, 1985, and at that time there
 were two bulletin board systems in West Pasco.  The Windjammer's Bay, a
 Commodore 64 based system run by Steve Watford, and Fast Eddies' BBS, an
 Apple // based system run by Ed Black.  Both systems ran 300 bps modems and
 used floppy disks for storage!  The Inner Sanctum brought high speed (1200
 bps) communications and a hard disk for storage (a whopping 10 meg drive).
 All this running on a five slot IBM PC!  Shortly after our first birthday, the
 system was coming up on call number 20,000.  I'd have never believed that sort
 of response by folks in West Pasco could have been possible.  There were only
 60 or 70 folks using modems then, so that meant each one was calling quite a
 bit!"

 Editor's Note:  PBM Flashback will appear on a regular basis in future issues.
 Most issues will have this brief look back at some of the features which have
 appeared over the history of the Pasco BBS Magazine.

 Net Worth
 ---------

 Written by Shawn Berg, New Port Richey, FL

 Why are we all arguing about America Online, Prodigy, and Compuserve?  In
 PC/Computing's September feature, "Online Fever" (page 140), they state that
 you can get a basic Prodigy membership for $14.95 a month, which comes with
 five free hours.  Additional hours are $3.60 a piece!  All or MOST of the
 information you can get on these on-line services you can get on local
 bulletin board services like The Storm's Fury, Board of Trade, Studio-PC and
 MANY more!  You can also get this information on plain Internet!  I get
 unlimited access to the full Internet for $29 a month!  There is no extra
 charge for more hours.  Online services like Prodigy give you five free hours
 (which might sound terrific to you) just to get you addicted.  Trust me, those
 five hours will go extremely fast!  And on the Internet, you can get twice as
 much as on America Online, Compuserve, and Prodigy!  So why pay such outrages
 prices?

 PC/Computing's response on page 28 of the January '95 issue: "Net Worth"

 "I'd PAY for the on-line services rather than surf in cyberspace because
 they're better organized.  Like PC/Computing, these services filter out the
 noise and organize information so you can find it easily.  Case in point, I
 did a keyword search on WWW for cat (as in tabby) and pet.  I got some feline
 information, but most related to computer-aided tomography and proton-electron
 transfer."  (HB)

 Now what do you think?  I would like to take a vote of most of Pasco County's
 BBS users and see what they think is more worth it and send it to
 PC/Computing.  So leave E-Mail to Shawn Berg on the Board of Trade BBS (862-
 4772), or leave E-Mail to IceBerg on The Storm's Fury BBS (843-8905/849-2272).
 I appreciate your cooperation.

 Editor's Note:  Thanks to Shawn Berg for the interesting editorial, and we
 hope to see more editorials from him in future issues.  The Pasco BBS Magazine
 will print any interesting responses received in a future issue of the
 magazine.  So if you have some feelings about "net worth" send them along.
 The Pasco BBS Magazine wants your opinion, and welcomes opposing viewpoints.
 Readers are encouraged to send along opinions on any BBS, or computer, related
 issue.

 1995 BBS Event Schedule

 further from the truth, as there are more events scheduled for 1995 than ever
 before.  While the Pasco BBS Magazine will be unable send a representative to
 all these events, or give the extensive coverage given to the Tampa show, we
 do want to pass along the current schedule for 1995.  Additional information

 Top Ten Things Some Users Do To Annoy Sysops, Courtesy of Sandy Illes

 10.  Try to access Sysop functions.
  9.  Experiment with the ascii keys trying to find backdoors.
  8.  Upload a 5k file so they can download a 500k file.
  7.  Attempt to obtain multiple accounts.
  6.  Complain that they should be able to download anything they want since
      they're doing you a favor to even call your board.
  5.  Hang up inside a door.
  4.  Leave a Comment to Sysop asking for information that's already available
      in the bulletins.
  3.  Say, "I'd send money if you had more nodes."  (So you get more nodes and
      they don't call back for a year, during which their account has expired.)
  2.  Request commercial software.
  1.  Distribute viruses and trojans.

 Intel Pentium Processor Replacement Policy Announced
 ----------------------------------------------------

 Santa Clara, CA, December 20, 1994 -- Intel today said it will exchange the
 processor for any owner of a  Pentium(TM) processor-based system who is
 concerned about the subtle flaw in the floating point unit of the processor.
 The company has been criticized in recent weeks for replacing processors on
 the basis of need rather than on request.  Intel will take a reserve against
 fourth quarter earnings to cover costs associated with the replacement
 program.

 The flaw can produce reduced precision in floating point divide operations
 once every nine billion random number pairs.  Intel said that while almost no
 one will ever encounter the flaw, the company will nevertheless replace the
 processor upon request with an updated version that does not have the flaw.
 This offer will be in effect for the lifetime of a user's PC, which means that
 users can conclude they do not currently want a replacement, but still have
 the option of replacing the chip in the future if they wish.  Intel is making
 a rapid manufacturing transition to the updated version, and expects to be
 able to ship sufficient replacement parts to meet demand during the next few
 months.

 "The past few weeks have been deeply troubling.  What we view as an extremely
 minor technical problem has taken on a life of its own," said Dr.  Andrew S.
 Grove, president and chief executive officer. "Our OEM customers and the
 retail channel have been very supportive during this difficult period, and we
 are very grateful," Dr. Grove said.  "To support them and their customers, we
 are today announcing a no-questions-asked return policy on the current version
 of the Pentium processor."

 "Our previous policy was to talk with users to determine whether their needs
 required replacement of the processor.  To some people, this policy seemed
 arrogant and uncaring.  We apologize.  We were motivated by a belief that
 replacement is simply unnecessary for most people.  We still feel that way,
 but we are changing our policy because we want there to be no doubt that we
 stand behind this product."

 Intel will send a replacement processor to PC users who choose to do the
 replacement themselves, and will offer telephone technical assistance.  Call
 1-800-628-8686 for details.  Intel also said it planned to contract with
 service providers to do replacements at no charge for PC owners who prefer to
 bring their PC's to a service location.  Details will be provided in the next
 few weeks.  Finally, Intel said it would work with its OEM customers to
 provide replacement for PC users who prefer to work with the manufacturer of
 their system.

 The company said it would take an unspecified but material charge against
 fourth quarter earnings to cover costs associated with the replacement program
 announced today.  Intel said it was unable to determine the amount of the
 reserve, but said an estimated total will be provided on or before January 17,
 the date of Intel's 1994 financial results announcement.

 Intel, the world's largest chip maker, is also a leading manufacturer of
 personal computers, networking and communications products.

 Editor's Note:  The above is from a press release from Intel and all inquiries
 should be directed to them.

 Corrections and Clarifications
 ------------------------------

 Last month's Special Second Anniversary Issue had a mistake in the masthead,
 as the year was listed as 1994 instead of 1995.  This was the first time that
 a mistake in the masthead had occurred and hopefully that type of mistake will
 not happen again.  We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.

 Matt Holden did not submit his Hallways segment for this month's issue.
 Hopefully, his series of door game reviews will continue in future issues.

 Next Month
 ----------

 The March issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine will have a special feature on
 seniors on-line, and some may be surprised just how many have jumped on the
 information superhighway.  We will have all our regular features including
 more on the upcoming ONE BBSCON '95, a PBM Flashback featuring Dam Linton of
 Software Creations BBS and more computer humor courtesy of ROTFL Digest!
 There will be another article from Paul Pollack and news about a new project
 he is working on.  Hopefully, we will have some responses to this month's
 editorial on net worth.

 There are several articles in the works for future issues, including the first
 "Pasco BBS Magazine Lifetime Achievement Awards."  Each year we would like to
 reward an individual who has made a significant contribution to the Pasco
 County on-line community.  We are now taking nominations for the award from
 readers of the magazine, so if you think someone is deserving of some
 recognition, please let us know.  Award recipients will receive some sort of
 plaque or certificate for their efforts on behalf of our community, and will
 be featured in an article in the magazine.

 Do not miss an exciting issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine!  Look for the March
 issue, available by February 22.
