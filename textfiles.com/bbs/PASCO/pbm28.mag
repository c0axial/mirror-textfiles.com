 Editor's Welcome
 ----------------

 Welcome to another issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine!  This month we look at the
 largest gathering of BBS operators of the year, perhaps in history, the ONE
 BBSCON '94.  Atlanta plays host to this year's event and the stage is set for
 another successful show.  Read a preview of BBSCON in this issue, and look for
 complete reports from Atlanta in future issues.  If it is half as much fun as
 last year, it will be well worth the price of admission.  I have been looking
 forward to this event for some time myself!

 This issue also has an article on game cheating by Paul Pollack, entitled
 "Cheating, is it wimpy?"  There is also a look at PKWare, an update on the
 Pasco Sysops Association, a list of some of our favorite taglines and all the
 latest BBS news.

 ONE BBSCON '94 Preview
 ----------------------

 The location was the base of Pike's Peak, a cool summer evening with a slight
 breeze, a high class hotel, a string quartet playing in the background, the
 beverage of your choice and hundreds of Sysops gathering for the start of the
 ONE BBSCON '93.  The biggest names in the BBS industry were there mingling
 with people who may have been operating a single line hobby board.  It was
 truly a wonderful beginning to what was an amazing convention.  On the evening
 of August 17 the scene will be repeated at the base of the Blue Ridge
 mountains, as the Welcoming Reception for ONE BBSCON '94 will be underway in
 downtown Atlanta.

 The third annual On-line Networking Exposition and BBS Convention, better
 known as ONE BBSCON '94, will take place August 17-21.  Most of the convention
 activities will take place at the Atlanta Market Center's INFORUM, with the
 Atlanta Marriott Marquis being the headquarters hotel.  Atlanta is the capital
 of Georgia, the county seat of Fulton County and has a population of
 approximately 400,000 people.  While maintaining its traditional southern
 charm, Atlanta has a thriving electronics industry and will play host to the
 1996 Summer Olympic Games.  This year marks the first time the ONE BBSCON has
 been held outside of Colorado, and it seems like a good idea to move the event
 around the country from year to year.

 ONE BBSCON is the brainchild of Jack Rickard and Phil Becker.  Jack Rickard is
 the editor of Boardwatch Magazine, the recognized leader in BBS magazines.
 Phil Becker is President of eSoft and the author of the TBBS bulletin board
 software.  It is expected that this year's event will draw more than the
 estimated 1,500 who went last year, with some predicting as many as 3,000 in
 attendance.  Each year the ONE BBSCON has grown and the success has lead to
 other BBS related events.

 One added bonus for this year's event is a special affiliation with Ziff Davis
 Interactive to hold their Summer Shareware Seminar at the ONE BBSCON.  It is a
 natural arrangement, as Shareware and bulletin boards have traditionally had a
 mutually advantageous relationship.  Combining the largest gathering of
 Shareware authors and the largest gathering of BBS operators in the same
 place, at the same time, should lead to an even more dynamic event.  There
 will be additional educational seminars for Shareware authors, or those who
 aspire to be a successful Shareware author.

 Once again the convention will feature over 100 educational seminars arranged
 in "tracks" on a wide variety of on-line topics.  The topics include
 Entrepreneurship on the Information Superhighway - How to Run a BBS for
 Profit, Survey of BBS Software Platforms, The Internet - Connectivity and
 Functions, Legal and Social Issues in Online Services, Education and
 Government Applications of BBS Technology, Business Applications of BBS
 Technology and several others.  The sessions will feature speakers who are the
 leaders in their particular area of expertise.  At any one time there will be
 several different seminars going on at one time, which can lead to some
 difficult decisions as to which ones to attend.  The seminars are an excellent
 source of information on virtually all aspects of the on-line world.

 Another very popular feature is the vendor exhibits scheduled for all day
 Friday and Saturday.  The biggest names in the BBS/Shareware industry will be
 there to display their latest products.  You can talk with software
 developers, view demonstrations and take advantage of special discounts
 offered during the convention.  Many companies wait to announce new releases
 at the BBSCON, so those in attendance get a first look.  Few people leave the
 convention without spending at least a few dollars in the exhibit area.

 Many look forward to the Boardwatch Magazine contest to find the most popular
 bulletin boards.  The top 100 boards in the contest should be announced just
 prior to the ONE BBSCON, with awards to be presented to the top boards at the
 convention.  It is quite a prestigious honor to win the contest, so many
 Sysops try all kinds of different promotions to solicit votes.  Last year the
 balloting was very close, so it will be interesting to see which boards come
 out on top this year.

 The Dvorak Awards at the 1993 version of the BBSCON were an enjoyable
 experience which was included in the cost of registration.  John Dvorak,
 columnist for several major computer related magazines, proved to be an
 excellent Master of Ceremonies for the award presentations.  His sense of
 humor actually made it a delightful session.  This year the Dvorak Awards for
 Excellence in PC Communications are to be held on Saturday night, and there is
 now a dinner involved and a price tag of $36.00 per person.  There is also a
 Shareware Awards Banquet presented by Ziff Davis Interactive and PC Magazine
 as part of the Summer Shareware Seminar.  This is an optional dinner event
 with a cost of $30.00 per person.  It will be interesting to see how many
 attend these functions.  The ONE BBSCON literature tells people to register
 early for the Dvorak Awards as seating is limited to 1,350.  Perhaps, the only
 reason to register early is that the price goes up if tickets are purchased at
 the door, but I don't think people will have any trouble finding a seat.

 At last year's ONE BBSCON the special added event was Jack & Phil's Steak Fry
 in the Mountains.  This year features "Down the Tara Trail."  For $35.00 per
 person you can get a taste of the Old South, including a visit to the new
 Margaret Mitchell Memorial Park.  This event is scheduled to take place on
 Friday August 19 from 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm.  Due to the nature of the tour the
 number of people is limited, and it could be canceled if there is not
 sufficient interest.  Considering the seminars and vendor exhibits will be
 going on at the same time as this tour, it may actually be difficult to get
 enough people to go.  But, it may be an ideal thing for those who have family
 members or spouses who may start to get a little bored with all the BBS talk.

 There is much to see and learn when attending the ONE BBSCON, but the
 opportunity to network with others may be the true benefit of attending.
 People who have the opportunity to go to a fair number of trade shows and
 conventions, say that this is one of the friendliest they come across.
 Everyone is willing to share their experiences, help others and in general
 have a good time.  The atmosphere is difficult to find any place else.

 For more information about ONE BBSCON '94 contact Peg Coniglio at (303) 693-
 5253.  Due to the dates of the convention, the September issue of the Pasco
 BBS Magazine will be released prior to the event.  But, the October issue will
 have a complete run down on the activities.  With this year's convention being
 held closer to the Tampa Bay area, more local Sysops should be able to attend.
 I am very much looking forward to this year's convention and hope to see you
 there.

 BBS Software Update
 -------------------

 Summer, and the approach of ONE BBSCON, usually brings major announcements
 from the BBS software companies and this year has been no exception.  In June
 Searchlight v4.0 was released.  eSoft has recently released TBBS v2.3 and
 Galacitcomm the Major BBS v6.2.  Wildcat! v4.0 has just been released and
 PCBoard has announced the beta testing of PCBoard v15.2.

 Clark Development Company, Inc. has announced that PCBoard v15.2 is ready
 for Beta Testing.  They expect to release PCBoard v15.2 around the end of
 this month.  Highlights of this new release will include built-in
 Internet (UUCP) support, built-in FIDO mail handling, "Credit Accounting"
 for charging (or rewarding) for activity on the BBS in units of credit,
 and expanded user base support for up to 2 billion users.  The additional
 mail support in this new version, which will eliminate the necessity for
 a front end, will be welcome news to many Sysops.

 Mustang Software has just released Wildcat! v4.0.  Many new features have been
 added to this BBS software package, which Mustang Software estimates is
 operating on over 26,000 systems worldwide.  There is now support for up to
 32,767 conferences and file areas, a new hierarchical menuing system, a new
 chat system for multi-line systems, a new message editor with a built-in on-
 line spell checker, the use of command stacking is now available when not
 using hot-key mode, there are now longer message headers to handle Internet
 type mail, group mail, improved security, new multiple language support is now
 available, bulletins are now downloadable from the bulletin menu, and the
 Sysop can now toggle a capture file from the system console for recording a
 caller's activity.  There is also a new wcCODE (Online Development Engine)
 support, which gives Wildcat! Sysops even more flexibility.

 Editor's Note:  It is difficult for the Pasco BBS Magazine to keep up with all
 the BBS software packages on the market.  Sysops are encouraged to send along
 articles and updates about their particular BBS software.  If you would like
 to see more coverage of your favorite software, write something up and send it
 along.  If we use your article, the Pasco BBS Magazine will be happy to run an
 ad for your board.

 Cheating, is it wimpy?
 ----------------------

 Written by Paul Pollack, author Best Shareware Games, New Port Richey, FL
 Edited by Alex Thomas, New Port Richey, FL

 The issue of cheating is seldom addressed in popular gaming magazines, but I
 feel it needs to be today.  Admit it, if you've played any games at all at one
 point you just wish you could press a magic button and make all your enemies
 or puzzles go away.  You're not alone.  There are a ton of people out there
 just like you who feel the same way, thus the multitude of gaming cheats and
 add-ons.

 But is cheating wimpy?

 Paul's opinion:  I feel that before we can pass judgement, we have to define
 cheating.  Is cheating just using trainers and saved game editors, or is
 cheating also looking at strategy guides or hint books?  For this section, I
 will consider all forms listed above as cheating.

 I feel that cheating in a way is wimpy, though I reluctantly admit that I have
 done it on several occasions.  Cheating takes away a lot of the enjoyment of
 playing a game because it leaves you with the feeling that you didn't
 accomplish anything/couldn't accomplish anything on your own.  Of course there
 are some games that are almost impossible to beat without cheating.  Look at
 Wolfenstein on Death Incarnate mode, look at Willy Beamish without a hint
 book, I could go on and on.  On these games, I have nothing against cheating,
 but I still feel that you should only cheat when necessary.

 Why does cheating make you feel like you didn't accomplish anything?  Because
 you cheated all the time.  I think that to get the full enjoyment out of a
 game you must only cheat when absolutely necessary.  I don't know about you,
 but I wouldn't really feel bad if I was stuck on a screen for a week and I
 went on to the next screen by cheating.  I truly believe a game is a lot more
 fun if you figure it out on your own then if you let someone or some program
 beat the game for you.

 Again I get back to the subject of reality's part in video and electronic
 gaming (my own note: Oh no!!!! not again!).  Another way cheating robs you of
 enjoyment lies in the fact that by cheating you destroy some of the realism.
 For example, let's say you're playing Doom and you play the whole game through
 with God mode.  Not only have you not accomplished anything, being invincible
 isn't that realistic.  Also, by cheating you lose some of the replay value.
 Another example is if you're playing Indy 500 and you put on a cheat to make
 your car invincible.  That isn't going to really happen either.  As I have
 said time and time (and time and time) again:  The more realism, the more
 sense of real life, and the more sense of accomplishment and enjoyment.
 Besides, playing a game as an invincible God gets very boring after a while.

 Cheating is like a coin.  There are two sides two it.  In one respect cheating
 is good, allowing frustrated gamers to finally find a way past the obstacle
 they are facing, but in a way it's bad, robbing gamers of enjoyment.

 I have an old version of Jeopardy for my PC, and after I got Game Buster, I
 tried it out on it.  I could lock in my money to whatever value I wanted.
 Eventually I just shut off the machine.  Why?  Because the game was no longer
 fun once the challenge was gone.  The same principle applies to any game of
 any genre.  What it boils down to is:  The more extensive the cheat, the less
 challenge, and the less fun.

 Alex's opinion:  From Al-leaks:  OK, this section's about game cheats.  You
 wanna make somethin' of it?  Just kidding, but seriously, I'm in a neutral
 position when dealing with game cheats.  Using Sega games as examples:  say
 you're playing Disney's Aladdin game.  The game is just too long to keep you
 interested.  I played to my fullest extent, and when I got to about the 7th
 level, I didn't WANT to play anymore.  On this game I used a cheat.  The Sega
 game called Shining Force (which, by the way is an RPG, one of my favorite
 game types) I didn't use a cheat, and got a lot more pleasure out of seeing
 the ending for that game than I did with Aladdin.  I guess my only advice is
 that if you've tried everything else and you can't win and just aren't having
 fun, go for the cheat.

 Favorite Taglines
 -----------------

 Some bulletin boards and off-line mail readers are set-up to add taglines
 to network type messages.  This is typically done to add a humorous thought
 onto the message.  The Pasco BBS Magazine will on occasion run some of our
 favorite taglines found while browsing the local nets.

 ... I know a good tagline when I steal one.

 ... Very funny Scotty - Now beam up my clothes!

 RAM DISK is NOT an installation procedure!

 ... Documentation - The worst part of programming.

 It's not easy cruisin' the info highway on a tricycle!

 Veni, Vidi, Velcro  (I came, I saw, I stuck around).

 ... A feature is a bug with seniority.

 ... "Could you continue your petty bickering?  I find it most intriguing."

 ... He who dies with the most TAGLINES wins!

 Why don't sharks eat lawyers?  Professional Courtesy.

 ... "The solution to the problem changes the problem."

 ... File not found.  Should I fake it?  (Y/N)

 Windows is NOT a virus - viruses do something!

 ... It's not the money I want, its the stuff.

 I understand Cats, Women are the mystery...

 Eagles soar, but weasels don't get sucked into jet engines.

 ... R.A.M. = Randomly Available Memory.

 ... Sysop (sihs'op) n.: The person laughing at your typing.

 A Quick Look at PKWare
 ----------------------

 Most everyone, who has ever called a bulletin board, is familiar with ZIP
 files.  Phil Katz is the developer of the compression algorithm which creates
 the ZIP format archive.  In 1986 Phil Katz released his first data compression
 program called PKarc/PKxarc, which created and extracted from ARC files.
 Later that year, he incorporated the Brown Deer, Wisconsin based Shareware
 company as PKWare, Inc.  Several years later the ZIP format was developed,
 which remains the most popular format in the BBS world.  While most have used
 PKWare's PKzip/PKunzip utilities, not all are familiar the company's full line
 of data compression products.

 The PKzip//PKunzip package is the one that most people use for compressing and
 extracting files.  This popular Shareware utility includes PKSFX, which
 converts ZIP files to self-extracting EXE files.  Some of PKWare's lesser
 known programs include PKZMENU, which is a stand-alone menu-driven version of
 PKZip.  PKFIND and PKZOOM are utilities for quickly locating files.  PKlite is
 designed to make more hard disk space available by reducing the size of
 executable files.  PKWare also offers a couple of data compression utilities
 for programmers, such as PKlite Professional and the PKWare Data Compression
 Library.  The company also offers a DOS shell called StupenDOS, which
 simplifies some of DOS's commands.

 PKWare offers technical support for their products through several different
 sources.  They monitor support conferences on the BBS based networks ILink,
 SmartNet and RIME.  There is also the PKWARE BBS, which can be reached at
 (414) 354-8670.  Voice support can reached at (414) 354-8699.  More
 information on PKWare can be obtained from any of the above sources.

 Peg Jump will be familiar to many people and is based on the classic peg game
 Hi-Que.  Some may have even made a variation of this game in shop class, as it
 made for an easy project.  All you had to do was drill 33 holes in a piece of
 wood, cut a small sized dowel rod in 32 1" sections, a little sanding and you
 were done.  Today you might find a copy at a local tavern or a Stuckey's, but
 they usually have plastic pegs.

 The rules for Peg Jump are simple.  The game board is a grid with a peg in
 every hole, expect the center hole.  The object is to jump the pegs, thus
 eliminating the jumped peg, and continue removing pegs until no more jumps are
 possible.  The goal is to leave a single peg, preferably in the center hole,
 but not everyone will be able to accomplish this task.  It makes sense a
 computer version of this classic game would evolve, and the game retains its
 flavor as a BBS door program.

 Peg Jump is one of some thirty doors in the Livewire Door Collection authored
 by Richard Paquette.  He has been operating the Livewire BBS since 1986, which
 can be reached at (609) 235-5297.

 Editor's Note:  This past March the Pasco BBS Magazine ran an exclusive
 interview with Richard Paquette.  That issue also has an article summarizing
 the programs in the Livewire Door Collection.  Sysops are encouraged to send
 us reviews of doors on their systems.  The magazine will continue to feature
 door reviews, but the best way to see your favorite door reviewed is to write
 something up and send it along.  If we use your article, the Pasco BBS
 Magazine will be happy to run an ad for your board.

 813 Area Code Changing
 ----------------------

 Once again the rapid growth in the state of Florida has necessitated a change
 in the telephone area codes.  The 813 area code, which currently stretches
 along Florida's west coast from Pasco County to Naples, will be shrinking.
 Pasco, Pinellas and Hillsborough counties will keep the current 813 area code,
 while Polk, Sarasota and Manatee counties will soon be in the brand new 941
 area code.  This change becomes effective May 28, 1995.

 Population growth is not the only reason this change is required.  The
 increase in fax machines, cellular phones, electronic pagers and, yes,
 computer modems would have caused the current 813 area code to run out of
 available numbers by 1996.  The new area code designations are expected to
 handle demand for new numbers until the year 2012.  Thankfully, all this
 should not have any dramatic effect on Pasco County.

 PSA Update - A Picnic and Much More
 -----------------------------------

 This month the Pasco BBS Magazine continues with the chronology of the Pasco
 Sysops Association.  It was an interesting month for the PSA.  This article
 begins with text written immediately following the PSA picnic, coverage of the
 July meeting, and a summary of what happened next.

 It was a typical Florida summer day as I headed north to Hudson for the first
 Pasco Sysop Association sponsored event, the PSA Picnic.  Summer was in full
 swing this last Saturday in June, as 1994 was just about half over.  Time sure
 flies!  There was a haze in the air, but a steady breeze made the temperature
 bearable.  Driving always makes my mind wander a bit, as it is a good time for
 reflection.  I drove by the Hudson library, the site of the PSA meetings.  I
 wondered how the attendance would be at the next couple of meetings.

 I really did not expect much as I approached the site of picnic, as I had no
 idea if any one would show up.  I was hoping our pot-luck picnic was not out
 of luck.  As I pulled into the parking area of Veterans Memorial Park, there
 were dozens of cars.  I guessed the majority of them were there for the
 sporting events which are taking place at the facility all the time.  I saw
 some children climbing on the playground apparatus, but did not see any PSA
 members.  I got out of the car and starting walking around the complex, and it
 did not take long for me to find several Sysops gathered at one of the
 pavilions.  It was a pleasant surprise to see that some had already begun
 showing up on this Saturday morning.

 Before too long more people were coming up the sidewalk from the parking area,
 bringing coolers, charcoal and food.  One of the grills was fired up for some
 hamburgers and macaroni salad was being passed around.  The discussion was
 about network mail, doors, users and occasionally a non-BBS related topic as
 well.  About fifteen people had showed for this first ever PSA sponsored
 event.  It was primarily PSA Sysops who attended, so there was some
 disappointment that more actual users had not showed for the picnic.  But,
 everyone was pleased with the turnout to say the least.  It was a very
 relaxing way to spend a few hours.

 Those who has thought the PSA was going to die a quick death now seemed to be
 wrong and the success of the picnic seemed to have saved the future of the
 PSA.  Some had said the dwindling attendance at the recent meetings was a sign
 that the PSA was in big trouble.  The PSA picnic should have put an end to
 that type of speculation.  Yes, the PSA is still feeling its way and has had
 some problems defining just what the scope of the organization will eventually
 be.  But, the good turnout at the picnic indicated that enough people are
 willing to work to make the organization a success.  In fact, following the
 picnic, the future of the Pasco Sysops Association looked quite bright.

 A little over a week later, the July regular meeting was held at the Hudson
 Library.  While driving to the meeting it was hard to imagine a large turnout.
 The meeting was so close to the Fourth of July holiday.  The O.J. Simpson
 preliminary hearing was going full-bore on TV, along with a World Cup soccer
 match which had just went into overtime.  I personally set the VCR to tape the
 end of the soccer game before heading to the meeting.

 When I arrived about five minutes before the scheduled start of the meeting,
 things were as feared.  Only a couple of people where there and over the next
 fifteen minutes the total was less than ten in attendance.  PSA President Dave
 Anderson expressed some disappointment at the way the meetings had been going
 and suggested that the location be moved to less formal surroundings.  Most in
 attendance then went to the local Hooters restaurant.  It was decided that the
 PSA would continue to meet at Hooters for the time being.

 Later that night Sean Fleeman, the PSA Secretary, wrote a message in the local
 Pasco Sysops echo conference explaining the events of the evening.  Here is
 part of what Sean said:

 "We decided to take another approach though.  We decided to say screw the
 meeting atmosphere, and went to Hooters.  The few of us who went to Hooters,
 enjoyed ourselves -- I can honestly say this was the most enjoyable "get
 together" that I have seen since PSA started.  There was no call to order,
 there were no votes, there were no minutes -- just a beer, wings, and a good
 time!"

 "PSA as it was, for the most part is no longer.  Those who cared enough to set
 aside that one evening a month to show, decided we liked this much more, so
 our next "get together" and in fact until we get tired of Hooters, will be at
 Hooters, on the first Tuesday of each month.  The "get together" will start
 when you get there.  There is no set time frame, if you want to be there at
 6:30 great, if you can't be there until 8:30 hey that is fine too!  If you
 want to stay until Hooters throws us out more power too you."

 "The general point of this message is we had fun, and that is the approach we
 took, and will be taking.  We will still have committees, and there will still
 be a President, a Vice-President, and a Secretary.  The Events Committee is
 still in effect, and the by-laws are too -- (when we decide we need to call a
 meeting to order that is), and there will be times where business will need to
 be discussed, but that can be taken care of very quickly.  I think everyone
 still wants to do things with the organization as far as events and that is
 great, so do I."

 Sean Fleeman also talked of the opportunity to attend the Library's Internet
 meeting the following Monday.  Arrangements had been made to dial out to
 bulletin boards at the Library's monthly meeting and Sysops were encouraged to
 come and show off their systems.  Surprisingly, only four Sysops showed up to
 take advantage of the chance to talk to a group of new users about bulletin
 boards.  Those who did attend, logged into their boards, showed some of what
 their systems offered and passed out business cards to all in attendance.
 This was a perfect example of one of the initial goals of the PSA, as Sysops
 had an opportunity to increase the exposure of their boards.  The presentation
 went quite well, and afterwards the group returned to Hooters.

 Where does all of this leave the future of the Pasco Sysops Association?  Will
 the move to a less formal location actually help?  Is this just a summer
 slowdown, or the first signs that the PSA is slipping away?  Over the next
 several months, the future of PSA should become more clear.  The old adage,
 nothing worthwhile comes easily, seems quite apropos.  The Pasco BBS Magazine
 will continue to cover the trials and tribulations of this Sysop organization.

 McAfee, Brightwork Update
 -------------------------

 McAfee Associates has announced that its entire product line, including
 products recently acquired from Brightwork Development and Automated Design
 Systems (ADS), is now available through electronic distribution for free
 evaluation.  Network managers and other members of the global online community
 can download fully functional versions of McAfee's award-winning family of
 Network Security Management products from public BBSs, on-line services,
 Internet, and McAfee's own HomeBase service (408-988-4004).  The new products
 join McAfee's best-selling family of electronically distributed anti-virus
 software.

 This dramatic move marks the first time in the history of the personal
 computer industry that successful shrink-wrap software has made such a large
 scale transition to electronic software distribution.  All products include
 complete documentation in both ASCII and formatted text.  The software is
 available 24 hours per day, seven days a week and is distributed without
 time-bombs and without encryption.  McAfee pioneered the electronic software
 distribution concept when it began distributing its first anti-virus software
 package, VirusScan, on BBSs in 1989.

 Today, McAfee's anti-virus software has become a corporate standard with an
 impressive 67% market share.  The company has three million licensed corporate
 and government anti-virus customers worldwide.  Seventy-seven of the Fortune
 100 entrust their data to McAfee's anti-virus software.  Twenty-five percent
 of the Fortune 100 have enterprise-wide site licenses.

 "The McAfee electronic evangelist who began as a virus-fighting desktop PC
 manager four years ago is now an enterprise-wide LAN manager," said Bill
 Larson, president and CEO of McAfee.  "Now they're coming to us for help in
 managing the integrity and security of their networks.  Our growing family of
 electronically distributed Network Security Management software will allow us
 to continue this relationship."

 "McAfee is also the standard anti-virus software for BBS operators worldwide,
 where its latest software updates are highly prized," said Mike Grayson,
 president of Fig Tree Computer Systems, a leading client/server consulting
 firm based in Plano, TX.  "Word spreads rapidly among the online community
 each time McAfee posts one of its monthly updates.  Often within minutes
 following a new posting, McAfee HomeBase service receives hundreds of
 downloads from BBS operators and users from around the world.  The service
 receives as many as 100,000 download requests per month."
