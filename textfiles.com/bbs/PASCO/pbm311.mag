 Editor's Welcome
 ----------------

 Hello and welcome to another issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine!  This month
 marks the 35th consecutive month that the magazine has been published.  But,
 there will be time to talk about that in the next couple of issues.  However,
 I do want to thank everyone who helped make it possible!

 This month's issue ties up a few loose ends from the ONE BBSCON held in Tampa
 this Summer.  There is an update on the Association of Online Professionals
 and a look ahead to next year's BBSCON.  Next year's event will be held in San
 Francisco and I certainly hope that circumstances permit me to attend.  It
 should be quite a show in one of the most beautiful cities in the country.
 This issue also reviews the new computer related comedy Dweebs, which is on
 CBS, Friday nights at 8:00 pm (Eastern).  Paul Pollack is back, this month he
 takes a look at Interactive Movies.  Of course, all our regular features are
 back too.

 I hope you enjoy this month's issue.  As always, thank you very much for
 reading!

 Association of Online Professionals Update
 ------------------------------------------

 One year ago, the Pasco BBS Magazine featured an article on a new Sysop
 organization called The Association of Online Professionals (AOP).
 Considering the track record of groups trying to organize Sysops, few would
 have blamed someone from believing that the AOP would be dead within a year.
 However, the Association of Online Professionals has done something that no
 other organization for on-line operators has done, it has not only survived,
 but is growing strong.  The organization, which was officially announced at
 ONE BBSCON '94 in Atlanta, has laid a solid foundation and is now 600 members
 strong.  This article takes a look at this organization, their "Code of
 Professional Standards," some of their promotional material and includes some
 comments from the AOP's Executive Director.

 The AOP's promotional literature states:  "The Association of Online
 Professionals is a non-profit trade association founded in 1994 to promote the
 interests of the professionals who plan, manage and provide services to the
 online telecommunications industry.  Whether you operate an online system,
 provide Internet access, or sell products and services to or through
 system operators, AOP is your professional association.  Already, we've
 established a strong record of performance on behalf of our members.  We're
 monitoring legislation at the federal and local levels, providing timely
 alerts of legislation that may affect online systems.  We're working with
 the attorney representing Sysops facing charges for online activities.  We're
 promoting our industry to the media, working to achieve a more balanced and
 accurate image of our industry.  We're providing professionals with the
 information and news they need to grow professionally and to prosper."

 The promotional literature continues:  "How can AOP provide this level of
 benefits and services?  Through a very simple idea:  That professionals
 working together can do more than individuals working alone.  AOP was created
 by leading members of our industry to support the individuals, online systems
 and companies that comprise that industry.  The Association is already
 supported by people you know and respect --  from Sysops of BBS systems and
 major online services to web sites on the Internet.  And by such leading
 companies as Hayes Microcomputer Products, USRobotics, Rockwell International
 and Clark Development.  Together, we are building an industry where
 professionals can practice their craft without undue interference.  An
 industry with room for individuals and systems to grow and prosper.  If there
 was ever a time for professionals to stand up and be counted, that time is
 now.  And AOP will continue to work to make membership the single best
 investment you can make in your company or system this year."

 At ONE BBSCON '95 in Tampa, the AOP signed up 160 new members.  Jim Harrier
 also announced, during the Opening Session, that Mustang Software, Inc. would
 join the AOP.  Boardwatch Magazine editor Jack Rickard and eSoft, Inc. also
 joined the ranks of the AOP at the Tampa BBSCON.  Jack Rickard talked about
 Sysop organizations and his commitment to the AOP at the Opening Session.  His
 comments did appear in last month's article on ONE BBSCON '95, but deserve to
 be repeated here.

 "Every year it seemed there was someone who came up with the idea of forming
 some sort of association of bulletin board operators.  I watched quite a
 parade of them come out, announce something, hope for 15,000 or 20,000 members
 instantly and when they didn't materialize, move on.  The question is why
 can't we get all the BBS operators to do x, whatever x is.  Basically, I
 didn't know.  I had never seen all the bulletin board operators do anything.
 If you got all the bulletin board operators in the world, and laid them end-
 to-end, they couldn't reach a conclusion, much less lunch.  They are a fairly
 independent group of people and getting them to do anything is a lot like
 herding cats.  I think one of the reasons they run bulletin boards, on-line
 services and their own Web sites is that the rest of the world didn't do to
 suit them.  So, they built another one where they could have a little control
 and do it their way."

 Rickard continued:  "Politically, almost all of the bulletin board operators
 tend to be Libertarians.  None of them actually join the Libertarian Party,
 there's too many rules, you don't really buy into all of it, but the tendency
 is towards Libertarianism, just don't want to actually become a member.  When
 we started Boardwatch Magazine people who ran on-line services were viewed
 much as you might a group of people who met every Tuesday evening to exchange
 toothbrushes.  They do what?  Why do they do that?  In recent years, it's not
 that much of a niche.  This has gone quite into the national eye and its
 become a bit of a mainstream thing.  It also lead to a curious desire by our
 governing structure to do two things, one is to regulate it, and the other is
 tax it.  To defend ourselves we are going to have to make some concessions on
 the I don't join and I don't get involved position.  The first organization
 I've joined in ten years is now this Association of On-Line Professionals."

 Shortly after the Opening Sessions the AOP's Executive Director, David
 McClure, was asked by the editor of the Pasco BBS Magazine the basic question
 "Why should a Sysop join the AOP?"  McClure began, "There some obvious reasons
 related to professional services, discounts and representation.  But, I think
 the most important reason that a Sysop should join is that we've moved beyond
 the day when a Sysop is an isolated operator sitting in his basement.  Today,
 we are in fact professionals, we are experts in the law, in customer service,
 the technologies of on-line communications, hardware and software.  And there
 are some very compelling reasons to begin to work together.  First, to begin
 to enhance the perceived level of professionalism, because if we are ever
 going to make strides in terms of getting some respect as an industry, in
 being able to get the salaries that a good Sysop should command, on the
 corporate side and on the private side, to be able to get things like bank
 credit card accounts without being hassled, people have to begin to begin to
 see us as the professionals that we are.  One of the ways that you do that is
 through the activities of a professional association."

 The AOP has two Classes of Membership.  Individual members are "individuals
 who manage or operate systems that include BBS systems, nodes of the Internet,
 nodes on message networks, remote access computers and other systems.  And
 they are the professionals actively involved in the industry who do not manage
 systems.  These include service providers, educators, law enforcement
 officers, government employees and others who share our commitment to the
 growth of the online community.  These members receive the full range of AOP
 services for an annual dues of $95."  Corporate members include "the companies
 that provide hardware, software, access services (including major online
 systems) and other direct services or support for system operators.  Corporate
 members pay a dues fee on a sliding scale based on gross annual sales, and
 receive up to five individual memberships, access to industry research data,
 access to members, and a role in industry promotion and public policy
 initiatives."

 David McClure was also asked what he would say to people who feel that $95 a
 year is a bit steep.  "There are always going to be people who are going to
 make the decision not to join.  Whether it's a financial decision, or based on
 something else.  I always find it amusing that a person who is willing to
 spend thousands of dollars on hardware, and hundreds of dollars every month on
 phone bills, wont support an organization that costs much less than that, and
 might keep them in business."

 There are many benefits to joining the AOP, besides the obvious reason of
 supporting the on-line community.  The AOP literature states:  "Service to
 members is the reason AOP exists, and its single goal for the years ahead."
 Services for members include:

 -- Opportunities for interaction with other professionals, including seminars,
    conferences and regional events.

 -- A voice in Washington, and in your state capitol, working to protect your
    interests.

 -- Professional advisory services for legal, business management, marketing
    and accounting issues.

 -- Career development, education and accreditation services for professionals.

 -- Referrals for Bulletin Boards.  Referrals to consultants.  And a job-search
    bank for professionals seeking new opportunities.

 -- Discounts on essential products and services.

 -- Industry-wide promotional programs to foster the growth of the online
    community, including  media relations, joint marketing and public
    education.

 -- Association publications that include membership directory, resource guide
    and more.

 -- A members-only BBS system for communication and information vital to online
    operations and management.

 -- A monthly newsletter, legislative alerts and other timely news.

 -- And the opportunity to take an active role in the growth and evolution of
    the world's fastest-growing and most vital industry.

 Association of Online Professionals.  Following the standards we re-print the
 Association of Online Professionals "Fact Sheet," which gives detailed

 From one bay area to another, the BBSCON moves from Tampa to San Francisco for
 next year's fifth rendition of the popular on-line trade show.  ONE BBSCON '96
 will take place August 7-11, 1996 at San Francisco's Marconi Center.  If early
 estimates are to be believed, California's fourth largest city could play host
 to somewhere in the range of 10,000 people.  In this article we, along with
 the convention organizers, look ahead to next summer's convention on the West
 Coast.

 At this year's ONE BBSCON in Tampa, Phil Becker, president of eSoft and one of
 the primary organizers of the BBSCON, was asked the simple question why San
 Francisco?  "For the reason that we have not been to the West Coast.  We were
 in Atlanta, here, and we have had a lot of people say 'we'd like to see it
 west.'  We started this in Colorado, we're too big, there's no place in
 Colorado we can do this show anymore.  Jack and I would take it home if we
 could, but there just isn't any place there that we'll fit.  So, we decided
 that California was the logical place.  We looked at California and it seemed
 to be San Francisco before it was done was the place to do it.  I think that
 if you look at the concept, Long Beach as an example has a gorgeous facility,
 the town was great, but if you tell people we're having it in Long Beach or
 we're having it in San Francisco, I think you just made a 2,000 people
 different in attendance."

 There was some discussion that because Tampa was out of the way for some
 people, that was a factor in the leveling off in the attendance for the 1995
 event.  Jack Rickard, editor of Boardwatch Magazine and the other half of the
 BBSCON team, was asked if holding the event in California would pose the same
 problem?  "No, I think we'll have the opposite problem.  We had more attendees
 in Atlanta last year from California than we had from Georgia.  So, California
 is the big ape as far as people involved on-line."  Phil Becker was also asked
 the same question.  "No, we believe quite the opposite.  It is a site that
 people want to go to, apparently, and I belive that it will really draw a
 lot."

 Remembering that early estimates for the Tampa BBSCON were twice what the
 actual attendance was, event organizers were asked for a projection on how
 many people they expected to attend the next BBSCON.  Jack Rickard speculated,
 "Oh, it's tough to tell.  I think we would be in the 10-12,000 range in San
 Francisco."  Phil Becker added, "I would say we'll have 8-10,000, maybe more,
 in San Francisco."

 It looks like ONE BBSCON '96 is shaping up to be another wonderful show.  Talk
 may turn from hurricanes to earthquakes, but a record number of on-line
 enthusiasts should make the trip out west.  California's fourth largest city
 is one of the most beautiful places in the country, so the early attendance
 estimates may just be right.

 Dweebs:  A Disappointment
 -------------------------

 You could see it coming.  With the increasing popularity of the personal
 computer in today's society, it was inevitable that the major commercial
 television networks would begin producing shows based on computer related
 themes.  CBS has added just such a situation comedy to its new Friday night
 lineup and is promoting the show, called Dweebs, as "the comedy with byte."
 Dweebs does feature a proven cast, but overall the first few episodes have
 been a disappointment.

 Some cast members are very well known to TV sitcom fans.  Actually, Dweebs
 probably has as strong a cast as any of the new shows this fall season.
 Farrah Forke plays Carey Garrett, the beautiful new office manager for
 CyberByte Software.  Forke is best known for her portrayal of Brain Hackett's
 helicopter pilot girlfriend Alex in the NBC hit sitcom Wings.  Peter Scolari
 plays the role of the quiet speaking company president Warren Mosley, the
 brains behind CyberByte Software.  Scolari has had roles in a couple of other
 sitcoms, most notably Newhart.  The show also features Cory Feldman, Stephen
 Tobolowsky, Adam Biesk and David Kaufman.  Tobolowsky's portrayal of Carl may
 be the best character of the show.

 The basic premise of Dweebs, which is produced by Warner Brothers Television,
 revolves around a group of male computer geeks who hire a new female office
 manager.  The story lines are based on her efforts to teach the guys about the
 real world, something they need a lot of help on.  Many of the punch lines
 come from the fact that she is a computer neophyte who does not understand
 half of what the guys are talking about.

 In the series premiere, the guys moved out of their garage and into a swanky
 new office.  The software company is very successful, as one of Carey's first
 tasks is to use a $3-million check to open up an account at the bank in the
 new office building.  This leads Carey to ask, "Penthouse suite, a check for
 $3-million, how successful are you guys?"  They are very successful, buy very
 quirky as well.  Warren's office is pretty much taken up by a trampoline,
 where he escapes to bounce and contemplate the next "killer app."  Carey's
 efforts to educate the dweebs begins early on, when they start discussing
 lunch.

 Warren:  "Explain something to me.  Lunch, what's that all about?

 Carey:  You don't know what lunch is?

 Warren:  "I understand the need for food in the middle of the day.  I just
 don't understand why it needs to be, lunch.  Everybody all sitting together,
 chit-chatting, laughing.

 Carey:  They're just being social.

 Warren:  I don't care to be social with most of the world, they never much
 wanted to be social with me.

 Carey:  The guys were telling me the hard times they had growing up.

 Warren:  Yeah, if I had a million for every time I was given a wedgie, wait, I
 do!

 Most of the jokes seem to be based on the theme that the guys cannot relate
 with other people, or that Carey doesn't understand much about computer
 technology.  She is so bad that a glimpse inside her apartment shows that all
 the digital clocks are flashing 12:00.  Of course, you put a beautiful woman
 together with a bunch of guys and you get the tried and true sitcom stable,
 gags based on sexual innuendo.  Unfortunately, over the first few shows, these
 types of jokes were probably the best lines of the show.  Take a look at this
 exchange from the premier episode.

 Warren (Talking to Carey):  Run a spreadsheet of third quarter miscellaneous
 expenses, shoot it to the financial sub-directory on my hard drive and
 attached a file copy to accounting.

 Carey:  Doesn't anybody here speak English?  I don't know anything about
 computers.  He wants me to spread a sheet over his hard thing!

 The next couple of episodes were very predictable, considering the premise.
 The guys come over to Carey's apartment for a visit, or a party, and the plot
 revolves around their inability to relate to other people.  Unfortunately, the
 attempts at humor are very weak and far too predictable.  In the long run, a
 strong cast may not be able to overcome the weak writing.  Other than a
 premise which has the potential to be tried again, if not milked to death, the
 show seems to have little hope of surviving.

 Interactive Movies
 ------------------

 Written by Paul Pollack, Editor of GamePlay Magazine, New Port Richey, FL
 Edited by Alex Thomas, New Port Richey, FL

 If only I had a penny for every game that claimed to be an IM, or Interactive
 Movie...  If you're like many gamers, you've probably tried some and been
 disappointed.  It seems like you can't look in any gaming magazine these days
 without hearing about a new game that claims to be an IM.  Here are a few
 titles that swept the media fairly recently that claimed to be one:  Critical
 Path, Quantum Gate, Myst, and Return to Zork.  With the possible exception of
 Myst, all these games were long on graphics, but when it came to actual game
 play, just didn't deliver.

 Too many game designers, in trying to expand the genre, have been
 concentrating too much on the movie part of an IM, and not enough in the way
 of interactivity.  I admit that Return to Zork has photorealistic graphics, I
 admit Quantum Gate and Critical Path (both related in some way to Media
 Vision) use digitized video, I admit that Dracula Unleashed looks good.  But
 you have to ask if these games really have the interactive elements necessary
 to create a good game.  For many games, the answer is too often no.  Every
 game has its drawbacks.  Return to Zork - Great graphics and good sound, but
 it lacks the animation necessary to a good game.  Quantum Gate and Critical
 Path, both didn't cut it when it came to gameplay.  The only POSSIBLE
 exception is Dracula Unleashed, which has good graphics, OK gameplay, but
 mediocre acting.

 Most gamers are confused about Interactive Movies, and they have good reason
 to be, there is no set definition of what an Interactive Movie is/or what it
 must contain.  It seems that if you took a poll of 1000 people, and asked what
 an Interactive Movie is, you'd probably get 1000 different answers.  I myself
 have my own opinion, which I'll print later in this article.

 Many people have tried to set their own guidelines for the definition, but
 most of these people have been "biased" game manufacturers and representatives
 tailor-making the definition for the game they were producing.  Most
 Interactive Movies right now are just dressed up adventure games, but where
 can you draw the line between a regular adventure game, and an Interactive
 Movie?  Is an IM, just an IM because it has live video and talks, or does it
 have to have something more.  Too often game companies miss out on the
 something more, and just add speech and video.  I myself have some specific
 standards I feel a game has to meet in order to be classified as an
 Interactive Movie.

 For me, an Interactive Movie has to have a good plot capable of evoking
 emotions ranging from the sadness of Schindler's list to the humor of Mrs.
 Doubtfire.  An IM has to use the same techniques real movies do, both graphic
 effects, and sound effects.  I feel an IM also MUST have digitized speech all
 the way through, else you lose a lot of the feeling of an Interactive Movie.
 The game must use actors, whether real actors, or synthetic actors (which I
 didn't know existed until Origin's Bioforge), and the actors must be
 believable.  It's not necessary to use live video, because when using
 synthetic actors, that's almost impossible.  For hardware definitions, I feel
 that this is the minimum that an Interactive Movie will end up requiring (if
 you keep up with MPC specs, this should sound familiar):

 #1- 486-SX 25 Minimum, 486 33/66/Pentium PC recommended
 #2- SVGA card capable of 640*480 with 256 colors displaying simultaneously
 #3- 4 MB RAM, 8 MB preferred
 #4- Double-speed CD-ROM (at least 300kb per second data transfer rate)
 #5- 8-bit sound card, 16-bit preferred

 As you can see, Interactive Movies will demand all they can from your
 computer's hardware, but the end result and finished product will make it all
 worth it.  I'll explain each of the requirements:  #1 is/will be required
 because of the speed needed to keep all the talking heads, background
 animation, and game file running at a tolerable rate. #2 is required because
 graphics are important to a game, and without the graphics element of
 photorealism, the game just won't cut it in the IM world.  #3 is needed for
 much the same reason as #1.  #4 is needed because IMs take up big space,
 sometimes filling more than one CD (Access's latest Under a Killing Moon is
 three!).  #5 is basically for the sound element, the game realism is greatly
 affected by the sound.

 Is there any future in IMs, or will the whole genre blow over in a few months?
 My opinion is that the current "cheap" IMs, the ports to CD with video clips
 and a little bit of speech, will eventually die off, and be replaced by full-
 fledged Interactive Movies.  The reason:  Today's Interactive Movies resemble
 movies ported to CD with a little gameplay mixed in more so than they do games
 with movie elements.  As soon as the public gets a taste of a real Interactive
 Movie, like Under a Killing Moon, or Bioforge, they won't settle for less.
 Soon, game designers will learn that it takes more than a few video clips, or
 a bunch of still screen shots stuck together to please gamers.  So just wait,
 in a few months, almost any title that appeals to your taste and claims to be
 an IM, probably will be.

 Two of the more exciting titles planned for release this year are Under a
 Killing Moon, and Bioforge.  Although both claim to be IMs, they both take a
 different approach to it, but in the end successfully accomplish their goal.
 First, let's take a detailed look at perhaps the most original title to come
 out of Origin in some year's now:  Bioforge.

 Bioforge is a pretty new project that promises to revolutionize the way the
 public looks upon IMs.  The game not only has beautifully written graphics
 going for it, but also has gorgeous graphics and animation.  BioForge is in
 some ways, similar to the smash hit, Alone in the Dark.  Both Alone in the
 Dark and Bioforge use multiple camera angles and viewing perspectives, and
 feature some fighting.  But unlike Alone in the Dark, Bioforge has superior
 texture-mapped characters.  There's where the synthetic actors come in.
 Synthetic actors are character's in the game that can perform any actions as a
 real actor, just at the user's will.  The game, slated for a soon release,
 fits ALMOST all of my requirements for an  IM. The only problem:  The game
 itself will first be released on disk, and I assume that it will not contain
 all the first-rate speech and/or some graphics.  This game could be one of the
 most influential titles ever to hit the market.  Watch for it!

 Now that we've gotten Bioforge out of the way, let's move our attention to
 another product that takes an entirely different approach to becoming an IM,
 Access' colossal 2-3 (I've heard rumors about both) CD, Under a Killing Moon.
 This game is perhaps the most widely anticipated, and widely rumored about
 games in history.  Definitely one to watch for.

 The ad asks, "What do film stars Brian Keith, Margot Kidder, & Russell Means
 all have in common?"  And the answer is, "They all star in ACCESS Software's
 new CD thriller Under a Killing Moon!"  In case you don't know who these
 people are, Margot Kidder was Lois Lane from Superman I-IV.  Brian Keith was
 an actor in "Family Affair," "Hardcastle and McCormick," along with many other
 films, and Russell Means starred in the hit movie, "The Last of the Mohicans."
 As Ken Williams, the president of perhaps the BEST game making company,
 Sierra, put it, "While Hollywood is getting more interactive, the interactive
 entertainment industry is getting more Hollywood."  By now you may be
 thinking, big deal, they used semi-pro actors in Return to Zork and look how
 that turned out.  But Under a Killing Moon is anything but Return to Zork II.
 In fact, one of the only thing Under a Killing Moon has in common is the great
 graphics that are of photorealistic quality.

 The history (some information from Compute magazine):  It all started when
 Access decided it was time to create another sequel in its Tex Murphy
 detective games.  So they bought a professional script writer, Aaron Conner to
 write the script for the game.  Now it was time to decide on the look of the
 game, so they went to the programmers.  They eventually decided on a 3D
 virtual reality look similar in look and feel to Wolfenstein and Doom, but
 instead use a 640*480 SVGA resolution. The engine allowed for movement all
 around the different rooms, and believe me, this is VERY impressive indeed.
 OK, so now that most of the movie part is complete, on to the actual gameplay
 part which first begins with the puzzles.  Since the game takes place in a
 three-dimensional first-person perspective, they couldn't use conventional
 puzzles.  Then they had to design personalities for all the characters.  After
 they found the actual actors, they began long hours of taping.  But it was
 well worth it.  The game has over two hours of quality digitized video
 incorporated into the game.  Boy, those actors must have been tired.  I read
 in an Interaction magazine that one of the biggest problems with the actors in
 King's Quest VI was the amount of dialog that had to be recorded for the CD-
 ROM multimedia version.  The actors couldn't understand how their character
 could be dead in one seen, and alive in the next.  This is probably how the
 actors for Under a Killing Moon felt.

 Ok.  The graphics are good, the plot is good, the puzzles are good, and the
 scrolling is good.  But what of the interactive elements and the interface.
 For the general interface, you use the mouse to move around the ornately
 decorated room, along with using icons for important functions like looking
 and talking.  Once you actually begin conversation with a person, the game
 switches from the normal, first-person perspective, to a new third-person
 perspective.  As in a real movie, the actors talking are not always filmed at
 the same camera angle.  The conversation is incredible, both with serious and
 humorous elements.

 When you add up all the elements of Under a Killing Moon, you get pure fun.
 No game so far has the complexity, or the graphics and animation to even begin
 to challenge it.  From the start of the company, Access has set new standards.
 With Under a Killing Moon, the interactive entertainment industry may never be
 the same again!

 All in all, the future for Interactive Movies is looking brighter and brighter
 with each passing day.  With the release of games like Bioforge, and Under a
 Killing Moon, we may see an explosion in the number of titles out there.  I
 invite you to come and explore new worlds, the worlds of Interactive Movies!

 Favorite Taglines
 -----------------

 Some bulletin boards and off-line mail readers are set-up to add taglines
 to network type messages.  This is typically done to add a humorous thought
 onto the message.  The Pasco BBS Magazine will on occasion run some of our
 favorite taglines found while browsing the local nets.

 I don't need any stinking taglines.

 Windows Ice Cream -- Hoggin' DOS

 CONGRESS.SYS Corrupted:  Re-Boot Washington D.C. (Y/N)?

 I think he's a few bytes short of a checksum.

 Whew!  Reality almost caught up to me ... but I got away!

 We all live in a yellow subroutine.

 Ensign Pillsbury?  He's BREAD Jim!

 If this were an actual tagline, it would be funny.

 On September 20, AT&T announced that the nation's largest telecommunications
 company would be breaking up.  The voluntary breakup divides AT&T into three
 companies, communications services, communications equipment manufacturing and
 computer manufacturing.  The move was aimed at raising shareholder value,
 providing more strategic flexibility and containing the damage from the
 floundering computer operation.  AT&T chairman Robert Allen was quoted as
 saying, "AT&T is re-inventing itself once again."

 The Road Ahead, a book about the information superhighway written by Bill

 Intel Corporation announced they had profits of $931-million for the third
 quarter of 1995.  This 41% increase over the same period last year was a

 MicroSoft Corporation announced that the sale of 7-million copies of Windows
 95 helped the company earn $499-million dollars during the most recent
 quarter.  Last year the company earned $316-million during the same period.

 PBM Flashback - November 1993
 -----------------------------

 The November 1993 issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine had a lengthy feature
 article on ONE BBSCON '93 held in Colorado Springs.  Dan Linton, Sysop of
 Software Creations BBS, was one of the panelists for the BBS Success
 Roundtable educational session at that year's convention.  The session turned
 out to be quite informative, but it was not without its lighter moments.  Dan
 Linton got off one of the better lines when discussing adding more telephone
 lines in the small town of Clinton, Massachusetts.

 "When they had the streets blocked off to put that cable in, the contractor
 basically asked me where all the people were going to sit in my living room to
 answer all those phones."

 Editor's Note:  PBM Flashback will appear on a regular basis in future issues.
 Most issues will have this brief look back at some of the features which have
 appeared over the history of the Pasco BBS Magazine.

 Next Month
 ----------

 Several things are in the works for upcoming issues of the Pasco BBS Magazine,
 but we are not quite sure which features will end up in the December issue.
 Next month's issue will have our updated BBS Glossary, which has become a
 tradition for the December issue.  There will also be some Christmas related
 articles and all our regular features.

 To find out exactly what makes it into the December issue of the Pasco BBS
 Magazine, make sure you do not miss the next issue.  The December issue of
 Tampa Bay's Oldest On-Line Magazine will be available on, or before, November
