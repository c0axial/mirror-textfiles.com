 Editor's Welcome
 ----------------

 Welcome to the Pasco BBS Magazine!

 After the last two issues, a Special Fourth Anniversary Issue and a Special
 Fiftieth Issue, some may have thought that we were doing a bit too much
 looking back.  In the past, I have criticized publications that "regurgitate"
 old articles, but have to admit we have been a bit guilty of that too.  I do
 think the issues were interesting reflections on what has gone before and an
 opportunity for this editor to catch his breath.  I hope to make up for it
 this month with co-features and am working on what could be a very interesting
 article for next month.  We have looked back, now it is time to forge ahead.

 This month we begin with a look at the exciting new 3D game Quake and it looks
 like the folks at id Software have another winner.  That article is followed
 by an original short story called "In His Own Image."  The story is written by
 Tom Gordon, who has previously written some hilarious computer definitions for
 this publication.  This month also features an article on the latest release
 of DA BUCS, another installment of Ed Garwood's Computer Basics, some
 Shareware reviews and all the latest news.  I really hope you enjoy this
 issue.

 Thanks for reading!

 id Software's Quake
 -------------------

 It is dark.  There are chain saw toting ogres lobbing grenades at you from
 above.  A fiend comes at you like a charging bull.  Yes, id Software's new
 game Quake can be downright scary.  This latest effort, from the people that
 created Wolfenstein 3D and Doom, once again raises the standard in the 3D
 gaming world.  Just like their past games, id Software has released Quake into
 the Shareware market.  Let's take a look at this exciting new game.

 Here is how id Software describes Quake in their promotional literature.
 "Quake marks the next generational advancement of game play technology and
 design.  Industry vanguards, John Carmack and Michael Abrash, developed Quake
 using a totally new engine, the first new core technology from id since DOOM,
 which allows gamers to rip through Quake's world at incredible speeds without
 sacrificing the game's intense graphics.   Designed with multi-player gaming
 in mind, QUAKE uses client/server technology to maximize modem and network
 play, resulting in brutal and exhilarating deathmatches.  Quake is a true 3D
 game, allowing players to explore, stalk and battle within the six degrees of
 freedom.  Quake features id's trademark in-your-face lightening-fast action
 game play, intense weapons and monsters, amazing sound effects and mesmerizing
 environments for the most extreme battling experience possible on a computer."

 id is not just blowing smoke, as Quake features a true 3D environment with
 texture mapped polygons instead of the more traditional sprites found in
 earlier games.  This new game engine features multiple levels and monsters who
 can be above or below the player.  It is possible to jump down and stand on
 the head of one of your foes, however, this is not recommended.  Quake also
 features improvements to the game's artificial intelligence and the monster's
 use their weapons more effectively.  I had to play the game for many hours,
 but I finally saw it for myself.  Yes, it is true that you may actually see
 monsters battling each other.  I did not believe it, until I saw a death
 knight start swinging his sword at an ogre.  In some cases, this can work to
 the player's advantage.  On more than one occasion, I have set back and let
 the monsters kill each other.

 Why does the player find themselves in this dark world filled with all these
 bad guys?  Well, an enemy code-named Quake has taken over a secret
 installation where a Slipgate device is being perfected.  This Slipgate allows
 the transporting of people and cargo, but an evil foe has infiltrated the base
 using their own Slipgate contraption.  It appears you are the lone survivor
 and Operation Counterstrike depends on your finding the Slipgate and going to
 Quake's dimension.  The game begins with the Shareware episode called
 Dimension of the Doomed, followed by registered episodes called Realm of Black
 Magic, Netherworld and The Elder World.

 Quake uses typical keys for game control, but no longer has a "use" key.  You
 do not have to push the space bar, or any other key, to open doors or activate
 switches.  Just walk up to a door, panel, or switch and the action will take
 place.  The player maneuvers around using the arrow keys and can run by using
 the shift key to increase speed.  To fire your weapon, use the CTRL key and
 the number keys are used to switch between weapons.  The F1 key provides a
 list of keyboard commands.

 Quake has buttons, doors, platforms and floorplates to be on the lookout for.
 Buttons and doors are activated with a touch, while platforms and floorplates
 need to be stepped on to activate.  Some buttons may need to be fired at,
 especially if they are out of reach.  There are also pressure plates and
 motion detectors, which may open secret doors or activate traps.  You can swim
 in the water, but look out for the slime and lava.  If you go under water, you
 will have to come up for air after about ten seconds, unless you have found
 the protective suit.  The greenish slime and reddish lava will kill you
 quickly without the necessary protection.  There are also teleporters, which
 send you to another part of the level.

 The rottweiler dogs and grunts are the easiest Quake foes to kill, but the
 game does have some real tough enemies to deal with.  The registered version
 has upgraded grunts called enforcers.  There are sword wielding knights to
 watch out for and the registered version adds the tougher death knights.  If
 you go underwater in the registered version, you will have to watch out for
 the rotfish.  There are also zombies, which can only be stunned with most
 weapons, but a properly placed grenade will blow them to bits.  There are also
 the rather ugly, but relatively easy to kill, flying scrags.  The chain saw
 toting ogre is one tough cookie, lobbing grenades in your direction.  The
 registered version also features a blob known as a spawn.  There are also
 deadly fiends, which come at the player like a charging bull.  The registered
 version adds a fire throwing spider-like creature known as a vore.  Quake's
 toughest enemy, which is as difficult to kill as most other game's boss
 monsters, is the shambler.

 Quake does provide a fair variety of weapons to use to take out your
 adversaries.  The basic weapon is an Axe, but it is difficult to kill much of
 anything with it.  There is a shotgun, and better yet, the double-barrelled
 shotgun.  There is a nailgun dispensing armor-piercing darts and a perforator
 scattering spikes out of four cyclic barrels.  The grenade launcher is an
 awesome weapon and the rocket launcher also tosses grenades at your foes.  The
 game's top weapon is called the thunderbolt.

 During the game you can pick-up ammo, including shells, nails, grenades and
 cells for the thunderbolt.  There is also armor, megahealth, the biosuit, the
 pentagram of protection and quad damage to pick-up.  The ring of shadows will
 make you nearly invisible.  Quake is also filled with an assortment of
 different deadly traps.  There are spike shooters tossing out bits of metal,
 trapdoors and ceilings that fall and crush you.

 id Software created a new wave of gaming when they added the multi-player
 element to their previous game Doom.  Over the Internet, or via a modem
 connection, people began playing deathmatches with others across the country.
 This new trend should only be accelerated with the multi-player features in
 Quake.  The game allows up to sixteen people to play over a network server or
 the Internet.  Players can participate in a cooperative, or co-op, game, and
 work with friends to complete the level.  It is everyone for themselves in the
 popular deathmatch games and there is an option to play team games.

 id Software has also continued the innovation of letting people tinker with
 the game itself.  One of the things that made Doom such a big hit were the
 levels created by players of the game.  Thousands of additional levels are
 available for the registered version of Doom.  With Quake, id took it a step
 further.  They built a Quake C programming language into the program, which
 allows players unprecedented game customizing.  While creating levels for
 Quake is more time consuming than Doom level creation, some levels are
 beginning to show up.  But, what is getting more attention are some of the
 weapons that people have made for the game.  Someone has created a Decent-like
 plane to fly around in, with stinger missiles and a cannon.  Others have added
 flashlights, flamethrowers, grappling hooks, cluster bombs and a throwing axe.
 One of the more innovative items is a "Dog Launcher," which fires a live
 Doberman out of the missile launcher.  There is also a "Cujo" patch, which
 gives the player a helper who attacks the throat of your foes and eats
 scattered body parts to increase its health.

 id Software is planning on using some these new weapons in Quake 2, which is
 scheduled for release in mid-1997.  They will also be adding the "Frisbee of
 Death," Hellcube and Black Hole in the updated version.  The best place to get
 information on current and future releases is on id Software's web site at
 http://www.idsoftware.com.

 In His Own Image
 ----------------

 Written by Tom Gordon, New Port Richey, FL

 Wayne McNeal was sipping a bitter cup of coffee when Jack Henning joined him
 for breakfast at THE HUT.

 "I know that look," said Wayne, scrutinizing Jack.  "Another part of your
 novel came true."

 "It's that obvious, huh?"

 A waitress appeared, took their order after pouring Jack a cup of coffee, and
 wiggled away.

 "Okay," said Wayne, "let's hear it."

 Jack sighed resignedly and said, "My hat's gone.  You know, the brown RAIDERS
 OF THE LOST ARK fedora I had.  Disappeared just like in my book."

 "You lost it somewhere?"

 "No," said Jack, lighting a smoke.  "When Rich--you know Rich--dropped me off
 last night he said I had it on.  I walked fifty feet to my back door and
 that's where it must have vanished.  It was nowhere around this morning."

 "Maybe you fell down outside and it came off."

 "Well, I had a few, but I wasn't that zonked."

 Wayne regarded him with knitted brows and a smirk, saying, "Oh?"

 Jack shook his head, saying, "Okay, let's say it fell off, I didn't know it,
 and somebody found it.  Fine.  The whole thing's a coincidence.  But that
 isn't all that happened."

 "What else?" asked Wayne, making a disgusted face at his acrid cup of coffee.

 "Did you see the fight last night?" asked Jack.  "The Hagler-Leonard rematch?"

 "Yes, unfortunately," said Wayne.  "I lost ten bucks on it.  I suppose you're
 going to tell me the fight was in your book.  But that fight's been on the
 drawing board for years.  It's like saying Mike Tyson's gonna fight for the
 title again.  Nothing supernatural about it."

 "No, not just that the fight was in my book--which it was--but there's more.
 Remember in the fifth round when Hagler was cut?"

 "How can I forget?  That's when my money starting inching its way out of my
 wallet.  How's that for supernatural?"

 Jack frowned and leaned back in his chair.

 "Sorry," said Wayne.  "Go ahead.  Hagler was cut.  Then what?"

 "So the fight announcer says, 'Hagler's got Juan Fuentes, one of the best cut-
 men in the business, in his corner.'  Juan Fuentes is a character in one of my
 short stories.  Can't you see?  This thing's carried beyond my novel!"

 Wayne pursed his lips and shook his head.  "Jack, look at this realistically.
 Juan Fuentes is most likely a common name, like John Smith in English.  There
 are probably thousands of people with that name."

 "It isn't only the name," said Jack, getting frustrated.  "The man looked like
 my character.  Pot belly, a mouth full of yellow horse-teeth, the whole nine
 yards.  He was my character."

 "I'd say it was a case of they all look alike.  You told me yourself you
 couldn't tell one Jap from another in that Godzilla flick you watched last
 week."

 After breakfast, Jack and Wayne went to the office of their small-circulation,
 computer-related magazine of humor, TOUR DE FARCE.  Being nearly a non-profit
 venture, they both held other jobs:  Wayne managed the NIGHTTIME carwash; Jack
 worked part-time at a local computer store and wrote horror stories he sold to
 various magazines.  There was also his soon-to-be-published novel.

 "Well, assistant editor, shall we get to work?" said Wayne.

 "If you say so, editor," smiled Jack.  "I gotta leave about 11 to meet Gerry
 for an early lunch.  Not that I'll want much after those concrete pancakes I
 had," and he rubbed his paunch.  "By the way, I wonder if you could do me a
 favor?"

 "Taking off an hour early for lunch and you have the gall to ask a favor?"
 said Wayne, trying to look perturbed.

 "Terrible, ain't it?  Anyway, I cut my finger on some glass.  I was wondering
 if you could type up that autobiography I wrote that my agent's been pestering
 me for.  It's only three pages and you can use my computer."

 "Cut yourself when you fell down last night and lost your hat?"

 "No, smart guy," said Jack.  "I cut it washing dishes; a glass broke."  Jack
 walked toward his desk, the neoprene soles on his new shoes squealing like
 chalk on a blackboard.

 "I guess I can handle three pages--Christ, why'd you buy those creaker
 sneakers?"

 "They were on sale.  Now I know why...  We could get a cheap rug."

                                     *****

 Jack entered Community Hospital, the antiseptic smell churning his stomach as
 it always did.  Making his way toward what he called the "nut ward," he smiled
 at a cute candystriper.  While looking at the young girl, he nearly ran into
 an orderly pushing a gurney.

 Gerry Marsden was at her desk where she worked as charge nurse in the
 nonviolent or "open" ward of the psychiatric department.  Here were the
 senile, the alzheimers and other assorted wackos.

 "Find any Steinbecks or Kings today?" asked Gerry in a language resembling
 English.

 "I'll be ready in a few minutes," said Gerry.  "Barb had to go down to X-ray.
 Soon as she's back, we're off to lunch."

 Jack gazed around the room.  An old black man, who fancied himself Jimi
 Hendrix, staggered around fingering an invisible Stratocaster while mouthing
 guitar sounds of the Star-Spangled Banner.

 "DAR-DA-DART-DAR!  DAR-DA-DART-DAR!" he repeated incessantly.

 "Record seems to be stuck," said Jack.

 "I wish he knew another tune," said Gerry.  "Or at least the rest of that
 one."

 "Maybe he really is Hendrix," said Jack.  "He didn't die but just went nuts.
 Hmmm...If enough people believe it we could charge admission and-"

 "Shall I sign you in, Mr. Barnum?" interrupted Gerry.  "We've got a nice soft
 room for you."

 An old fat woman suddenly yelled, "Give me a bird in the hand or give me
 death!"  She then added in a lower voice, "Never count your chickens in the
 eye of the beholder."

 "I think she's got her proverbs a little twisted," said Jack.  "She's a new
 patient, isn't she?"

 "Yes, the police just brought her in this morning.  They found her ranting and
 raving on the street, yelling out all her mixed-up sayings at the top of her
 lungs.  She had no ID so I call her Miss Quote."

 "Ask not what your country can do for you," continued Miss Quote, "but carry a
 big stick."

 Another patient, a Downs syndrome case, began shouting: "Chocolate milk!
 Chocolate milk in my pants!"

 "Great," said Gerry.  "Jane Doe crapped her pants again."

 "At least you don't have to clean it, do you?" said Jack.

 "No.  That's why God made CNA's and orderlies... By the way, did you hear the
 weather report?"

 "A tropical storm out in the gulf, headed this way."

 "You heard the weather report?"

 "No," said Jack.  "I wrote it."

                                     *****

 Jack entered the office of TOUR DE FARCE the next day over a half hour late.

 "You look like something the cat dragged in," said Wayne.

 "You're close," said Jack, sliding a hand through his unkempt hair.  "Listen,
 Wayne, I gotta go get a drink.  I gotta talk to you."

 "It's damn near lunchtime, anyway," said Wayne.  "Let me get these things in
 order," and he began shuffling papers and banging on his keyboard.

 Jack headed toward the bathroom, which was off the small back room used for
 storage.  His neoprene soles squeaked like a rusty door hinge in the wind.

 "A good thing I own this building," mused Wayne.  "We'd never be able to pay
 the rent.  Lately we've been working between breaks."

 They went to the BELLY UP bar, a seedy dive down the street that specialized
 in skunk-beer and rotgut wine (muscatel, Thunderbird, MD 20-20).  The only
 other customers were an old man and old woman sitting at opposite sides of the
 bar.  While Jack ordered, Wayne sat down at a smelly booth and looked around
 at the shabby interior.  On the far wall hung a decadent, infantile oil
 painting that led one to believe the artist must have been a psychotic three-
 year-old.  The felt on the nearest of the two pool tables was so torn up it
 appeared as if Jack the Ripper had been a steady player.  The glass on top of
 the lone pinball machine had been smashed to bits and lay on the playing
 surface like a billion dollars' worth of diamonds.

 Jack received his drinks from the bartender, a woman with a face that made
 Margaret Hamilton a cover girl.  As he started toward Wayne, he passed the old
 lady sitting at the bar and caught a whiff of her body odor.  It was a mixture
 of batter-dipped fish and sour yogurt.  Jack absently wondered if her name was
 Mrs. Paul Dannon.

 "Okay," said Wayne as Jack set down the beers, "what's the tragedy?"

 Jack told a deep breath and a large swallow of beer.  Then he said, "Gerry's
 cat died and I buried it.  That's why I was late."

 "Don't tell me," said Wayne.  "The same cat died in your book."

 "Yup.  Mitten, her favorite of all seven cats.  Torn to shreds by the monster
 in the first chapter."

 "And the real cat was torn up too, no doubt," said Wayne, taking a sip of
 beer.

 "No, it's worse.  The cat didn't die of anything.  No marks, it wasn't sick,
 it wasn't old.  Perfectly healthy.  Gerry was petting it and it just dropped
 dead in her lap."

 "Maybe it was poisoned," said Wayne.

 "No, the other cats ate from the same can of food... Don't you understand?  It
 shouldn't be dead but it has to be dead!"

 "Look," said Wayne, turning serious.  "You're really going overboard with this
 obsession.  I imagine what you're experiencing has happened to a lot of other
 writers.  And the more stuff you write, the more parallel happenings will
 occur.  Especially when you write about people you know.  I'd say you better
 get used to it."  He sighed and drank down his beer.  He belched and said,
 "Look, I'm going over to the HOAGIE HEAVEN to get a sub.  I sure wouldn't eat
 anything in this hole.  You wanna come?"

 "...No, I don't think so.  Think I'll stay here and drink lunch.  I'll meet
 you back at the office."

 "Take it easy.  If you're gonna float back you might as well take the rest of
 the day off."

 "I can't stomach much more of this skunk-beer.  I'll be alright."

 "Okay.  See you in a while," said Wayne, and he got up and left.

 Jack moved to the bar, sitting two stools down from the old man.  Not having a
 taste for any more skunk-beer, he ordered a glass of muscatel.  It was served
 by the ugly bartender along with a toothless grin.  Jack downed half the
 glass, then set it down on its stained coaster.  It tasted like rotten pears.

 Could it all just be coincidence? wondered Jack.  Possibly, but a gut feeling
 told him it wasn't.  And what about the storm in the gulf?  That in itself
 wasn't the big deal.  But one week before Thanksgiving, the same as he'd
 written it, was just too much.

 After finishing his second glass of muscatel while mulling things over, Jack
 was hungry.  The old man down from him had just gotten a burger, and Jack was
 considering one, till he saw the geezer's false teeth come halfway out of his
 mouth as they struggled with the leathery meat.  Forget it.

 Several people had entered the tavern since Jack took a seat at the bar, but
 they must have taken tables or booths.  He turned on his stool to see if there
 were any familiar faces.  There certainly were; Jack's mouth fell open in
 stunned surprise and his body stiffened.

 Two men sat talking animatedly in the booth where he and Wayne had been
 sitting.  There was just one man that Jack knew who wore a beard on only half
 his face; the crazed psychiatrist from the first short story he'd ever had
 published, VISITS TO THE SHRINK.  The immaculately dressed doctor sipped
 skunk-beer through a straw as he soberly listened to his companion, another of
 Jack's creations.  The second man sat holding a finely-honed lawn mower blade
 across his knees, his free hand on his glass.  As he lifted the beer to his
 mouth, his left pinky twitched spasmodically.  He could only be the mass-
 murdering Toro mechanic from Jack's latest story, THE CUTTING EDGE.

 Jack got another glass of wine and polished it off in a few quick gulps.

 Someone came in the side door and sat down at the bar to Jack's left.  Jack
 gave whoever it was a furtive glance.  A tall man wearing a black tuxedo with
 top hat and tails gave him a rotten-toothed smile.

 Jack got up and walked out of the bar.  Outside, he took a deep breath.  He
 stood next to a black hearse and yes, the incriminating blood-stained front
 bumper was missing; removed by the tuxedo-attired man inside--the hit-and-run
 mortician from the personal favorite of Jack's stories, ONE FOR THE ROAD.

 Jack was breathing so hard he felt hyperventilation coming on.  He had to do
 something...but what?  Think!  Think!  His head spun from wine and shock.

 Call Gerry!  Sure!  She had taken the day off from work when her cat died.

 Jack walked across the street to the Pick-Qwik which furnished two outside
 pay-phone stalls.  He fumbled in his pocket for change, then dropped a quarter
 in the slot.

 Gerry answered on the third ring.  "Hello?"

 "Hi.  It's me.  You won't--"

 "Hello?"  Hello!?"

 "Gerry!  It's me!"

 "Is somebody there?"

 "Yes!  I am!  Can't you hear me?"

 Click!

 "Great," said Jack, hanging up the phone.  "Figures I'd get a screwed-up
 phone."

 He was about to use the other phone but a grubby teenager, with a beard trying
 to force its way through his acne, beat him to it.  The kid looked vaguely
 familiar but Jack didn't want to think about that fact.

 Go back to work, he thought, taking a deep breath.  Get my mind off this.

 He walked to the office of TOUR DE FARCE, trying not to look at anyone or
 anything on the way.  When he opened the door he saw Wayne standing near his
 (Jack's) desk with some papers in his hand.

 "How's it going?" asked Jack as he closed the door.  Wayne didn't look at him
 or answer.

 "Okay," said Jack, "guess I deserve the silent treatment.  Been driving
 everyone else as crazy as I am.  That's what I figure; I'm Crazy."

 Wayne remained silent as the toilet flushed in the back room.  Jack wondered
 who was visiting.

 The bathroom door, not visible from the front door, could be heard opening.
 Wayne glanced toward it and in a slightly raised voice said, "I gotta take a
 run over to the print shop.  I finished typing up that autobiography you
 wrote.  It's on your desk, next to the computer."  He than grabbed his
 windbreaker off the back of the chair and left the office, not even
 acknowledging his assistant editor.

 Jack stood motionless as he heard the approaching footsteps from the back
 room, neoprene soles squeaking on the linoleum.

 Chinese Solitaire Review
 ------------------------

 Chinese Solitaire is the latest solitaire card game for Windows written by
 Randy Rasa.  This original game, combining elements of Klondike and Scorpion,
 with an Oriental flavor, can be beaten about one-third of the time.  As with
 the other solitaire games in Randy Rasa's Shareware collection, this game is
 well done.

 In Chinese Solitaire, forty-nine cards are dealt into seven stacks of seven
 cards.  The object is to move the cards to the top of the screen, just like in
 the more familiar solitaire games.  The program includes on-line help, but the
 game is fairly easy to learn.  This full featured program includes complete
 statistics, an easy mode, autoplay, sound, and the ability to change the card
 backs and colors.

 As with the other Randy Rasa programs, Chinese Solitaire is a very nice
 effort and has an inexpensive registration fee of $10.

 "Behind all the hype shaping the electronic highway are corporate interests.
 These huge companies are doing the most natural thing in the world to them;
 following their own corporate interest."

 The 904 area code, which covers most of north Florida, will be broke into
 three different area codes this year.  After a heated debate as to which part
 of the state should retain the current 904 area code, the Public Service
 Commission voted 3-2 to recommend the Tallahassee area keep the 904
 designation.  The Jacksonville area will receive a new area code, as will the
 Daytona Beach area.  One of the new area codes will be 850 and the other is to
 be determined.  The new area codes will begin in June, with a one year grace
 period during which calls dialed using the old area code will still go
 through.  One reason that Tallahassee is keeping the old area code was the
 estimated $2.5 million it would have cost taxpayers to change phones and
 reprint state publications.  The splitting of area codes has been brought
 about due to the increased demand for telephone numbers for modems, beepers,
 fax machines and cellular phones.

 In January, Intel Corp. began shipping their Pentium MMX chips with the
 promise of improved graphics, video, sound and communications.  The new
 computer processor chip, designed to increase the performance of multimedia
 applications, will run existing programs 10 to 20 percent faster.  Some
 industry observers are predicting that the release of the new chip will
 generate an increase in computer sales and that older Pentium based systems
 will drop in price, perhaps, under $1,000.

 America On-Line (AOL), the largest on-line service, has been swamped with
 calls since changing to a flat rate pricing plan.  On December 1, the service
 began offering unlimited Internet access for $19.95 a month, but subscribers
 are being met with busy signals during peak times.  It has been estimated that
 AOL gained 500,000 subscribers in December alone and that the new flat rate
 has tripled the number of hours customers spend on-line.  AOL, facing the
 threat of breach of contract lawsuits, initially announced plans to grant
 refunds on a case-by-case basis.  Pressure from 36 state attorney generals
 caused the company to grant more liberal refunds.  Customers will now have the
 option of receiving a cash refund, or one month's free access.  AOL will also
 discontinue mailing out free sample disks, suspend advertising during February
 and add a disclaimer about log-on delays to future ads.  AOL has 8 million
 subscribers, 200,000 modems and is accessed 10 million times a day.  The
 company plans on spending $350 million over the next several months on new
 equipment and staff to handle the demand.  The Dulles, Virginia based company
 began adding new modems in February.  CompuServe Information Service, the
 second largest on-line service ran a commercial during Super Bowl XXXI, which
 started with a busy signal, and encouraged people to call 1-800-NOT-BUSY to
 join the service.  CompuServe reported that new subscriptions had increased by
 500 percent.  Comedians have been calling AOL America Off-Line.

 The National Football League announced that their Super Bowl web site was hit
 10.2 million times on Super Bowl Sunday.  This was a 40 percent increase over
 Super Bowl XXX.

 The Internal Revenue Service estimates that 12.1 million taxpayers filed their
 taxes by electronic means in 1996.  This represents an increase of 8.9 percent
 over 1995.  The IRS is encouraging people to file by non-traditional means and
 is heavily promoting their TeleFile option, which allows people to file tax
 returns over a touch-tone phone.

 Compaq Computer Corp. was the number one personal computer manufacturer during
 1996, followed by IBM, Apple, Packard Bell and Hewlett-Packard.

 The 1996 Internet World conference was held in December at the Jacob Javits
 Convention Center in New York City.  Organizers estimated that 600,000 people
 attended the four day event.

 In an attempt to stem the tide of falling revenues, Apple Computer, Inc. has
 started to announced parts of their restructuring plan.  The company will cut
 prices up to 27 percent and an undetermined number of employees, perhaps
 3,000, will be laid off.  On February 4, Apple announced that co-founder Steve
 Wozniak will return as an advisor.  Steve Jobs, who along with Wozniak founded
 Apple, recently returned to the company as well.  Apple, which is undergoing
 its second restructuring in less than a year, hopes to be profitable by
 September.

 Computer Telephony Expo 97 will be held March 4, 5 & 6, 1997 at the Los
 Angeles Convention Center.  The event will feature 74 seminars and an exhibit
 area.  Registration for the show is $895 and additional information is
 available on the World Wide Web at http://www.ctexpo.com.

 Intel Corp. has reported $1.9 billion in earnings for the fourth quarter,
 compared to $867 million for the same quarter a year ago.  The company's
 revenue rose to $6.4 billion, which was a 41 percent increase.  Apple Computer
 Inc. reported a loss of $120 million for the company's first quarter.  Revenue
 was reported at $2.1 billion, or a 32 percent drop.  International Business
 Machines reported a smaller than expected increase in net income for the
 fourth quarter at $2.02 billion, compared to $1.71 billion for the previous
 year.  IBM stock prices, which had been increasing at a steady pace, fell $10
 a share the day of the announcement and could drop further over the next few
 months.  IBM also announced a two-for-one stock split.  The stock split, which
 will be the first for IBM in 17 years, is scheduled for May.  Compaq Computer
 Corp. reported fourth quarter earnings of $462 million, compared to $82
 million last year.  Compaq's earnings were $1.3 billion on sales of $18.1
 billion.  Netscape Communications Corp. announced earnings of $8.8 million for
 the fourth quarter, compared to $511,000 a year ago.  The company's revenues
 doubled over the same period to $115.1 million.

 Computer Basics
 ---------------

 Written by Ed Garwood, Hudson, FL

 Filenames and Extensions

 A file name consists of two parts: the name of the file itself, not exceeding
 8 characters in length, and an optional extension, not to exceed 3 characters.
 The filename and the extension are separated by a period, i.e.:  COMMAND.COM

 There are a few restrictions on naming files:

 1.  Use only letters, numbers, hyphens or underscores.
 2.  Do NOT use any of the following characters:
     " / \ [ ] : ; , . * < > ? | + ?
 3.  Do not use reserved device names such as CON, COM, LPT, PRN, NUL, etc.
     Try to use meaningful names, so as to make identification a bit easier.

 You should NOT use extensions such as .COM, .EXE, or .BAT, unless you are
 creating an executable file, since these extensions are reserved for such
 files.

 The following are uses for various common extensions:

 .EXE - This indicates an executable file.  The file contains a lot of
 information about itself, and DOS can make many feats of memory management
 with this type of file.  .EXE files do not have to have all parts of the file
 loaded into memory.  An .EXE file needs at least 512 extra bytes per file to
 keep track of everything.  Thus, .EXE files usually exceed 64K in size.

 .COM - This type of file must be loaded into memory in its entirety, and only
 at a fixed location in memory.  Of necessity it must be a relatively short
 file, less than 64K, with all components lumped together.

 .BAT - This indicates a Batch File.  The .BAT extension may be used only with
 this type file.

 .OVL - This indicates an Overlay file.  Normally, only .EXE or .COM files are
 loaded into RAM when the program is run.  .EXE and .COM files reserve a
 certain amount of space in RAM (in the Overlay Area) for Overlay programs.
 When a feature not already in RAM is requested by the program, an Overlay file
 is loaded into the overlay area, replacing any other overlay program already
 there.  There can be but one overlay program in that area at any one time.  An
 example of such a program is a PRINTDOC.OVL program, which would print out the
 program manual.  It is usually a single purpose file.

 .BAK - Indicates a backup file, generated by the 'Backup' command.

 .BAS - Indicates BASIC programs, usually produced by the GWBASIC program.

 .HLP - This indicates a HELP program, usually found in programs with pulldown
 instructions, such as one might find in a word processing program.  They
 usually cannot be easily read with a reader program since they are specially
 formatted.

 .ZIP/.ARC - When either the .ZIP or .ARC extensions are found on a file, it
 usually indicates that the program has been compressed (ZIPPED, OR ARCHIVED)
 to about 1/2 its normal size.  Such programs must be "Unzipped" before they
 can be used in a normal fashion.  One uses a program such as "PKUNZIP" to do
 the job.

 .TXT - This, as its extension implies, is a TEXT or DOCUMENT (.DOC) file, of
 the type usually found in a word processor program.  Such programs can usually
 be read by entering 'TYPE FILENAME.TXT'

 .DTA - Usually indicates a Data File, such as one might find in a Data Base
 Program.

 .CAL - Many spreadsheet programs use this extension for their data files.

 .RPT - This extension is often used to indicate it is a Report.

 .LTR - Often used in word processors to indicate a Letter.

 .ME  - This is usually found in conjunction with READ.ME or README.1ST.

 .1ST - Such programs can usually be read with the 'TYPE' command, and give
 special information regarding the main program.  As you may guess, they are to
 be read first.

 .SYS - This extension is usually only found in two categories of files, System
 and Drivers.  The first type includes CONFIG.SYS, KEYBOARD.SYS AND
 COUNTRY.SYS.  These are loaded automatically into memory on Boot-Up.  The
 Second type, the Drivers, include ANSI.SYS, DISPLAY.SYS, PRINTER.SYS,
 SMARTDRV.SYS, etc.  These are installable device drivers.  To see what .SYS
 files you have, go to your DOS directory, and type DIR *.SYS.  For further
 info on these, see your DOS manual.

 .001 - Something like this can be used with drafts of documents.  For
 instance, in writing this paper, the first draft was given the filename
 "FILENAME.001".  The next draft was "FILENAME.002", etc.  Thus, I always knew
 which was the latest draft.  The final draft was "FILENAME.TXT"

 Many Graphics programs use various Extensions such as PRG, CFG, etc. to
 differentiate between various graphics types.

 Slam! Review
 ------------

 Slam! is a faithful version of the popular table game air hockey.  While the
 Windows game is nothing fancy, it is fun to play.

 Air hockey was quite a craze in the 1970s, but there does not seem to be many
 versions of it available in the Shareware market.  Robert Epps has written
 Slam! for Windows, which captures the speed of the table game.  While the game
 does not have intense graphics, it does have realistic sound effects with a
 sound card.  The game's options include adjusting the quickness and
 aggressiveness of your computer opponent, and various angles of view for the
 table.

 It is easy to load and play Slam!  Despite being simple in design, it is
 enjoyable to play.  The program may be registered for $10.

 PBM Flashback - March 1994
 --------------------------

 Richard Paquette was interviewed in the March 1994 issue of the Pasco BBS
 Magazine.  He was the publisher of BBS Caller's Digest, later named BBS
 Magazine, before the magazine ceased publication last year.  He also is the
 author of a collection of Shareware door programs for bulletin boards and has
 operated the Livewire BBS since 1986.  Here is what Richard Paquette said
 about the large collection of on-line magazines he has on his board.

 "We do have a magazine section, a download area.  We have a lot of magazines,
 a lot of on-line titles.  We hold copies back a year, or a year and a half.
 Titles that only come out once or twice and never show up again, we have them
 there.  Some we actually go and download on a regular basis, because we want
 to read them ourselves.  I have in the past called a few of the authors to get
 permission to use something that might have been in his on-line edition that
 we want to print in the magazine that we think our readers would like to know.
 We actually go through those on-line titles, and in many cases you can
 actually get in touch with the authors rather easily, and say 'hey I love this
 article and I'd like to print it.'  Surprizing they have all been very
 pleasant about it.  We don't mind having all those on-line titles there.  We
 think it is important for callers to know that there are many ways to get
 information."

 Editor's Note:  PBM Flashback will appear on a regular basis in future issues.
 Each issue will have this brief look back at some of the features which have
 appeared over the history of the Pasco BBS Magazine.

 Next Month
 ----------

 Next month we will take a look at our local west Pasco County (Florida) BBS
 community.  The plan is to write about some of the new boards in the area and
 to look at how the BBS scene has changed over the years.  There will also be
 another list of humorous computer viruses, more Shareware reviews and all the
 latest news.  Ed Garwood's Computer Basics will return, along with the rest of
 our regular features.  We are also looking ahead to our May issue, which will
 be our third special gaming issue.  That issue will feature The Complete
 Shareware Gaming Catalog, which will look at over 300 popular titles.

 Look for the April issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine, which will be available
 on, or before, March 22.  Make sure you do not miss a single issue of Tampa
 Bay's oldest free on-line magazine!
