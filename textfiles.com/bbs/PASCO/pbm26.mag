 Editor's Welcome
 ----------------

 This issue marks a year and a half of the Pasco BBS Magazine, or eighteen
 consecutive months of publication.  I do want to thank the many people who
 have made it all possible!  Let me not miss this opportunity to remind
 everyone that we would love to get more articles written by the readers of the
 magazine.

 This month we have a chat recorded live during a linkup between bulletin
 boards in Florida and Australia.  It was a great way to spend a Saturday
 morning, and I think you are really going to enjoy this article.  This issue
 also has the latest about the Pasco Sysop's Association and the PSA By-Laws
 passed at the May meeting.  We also cover the verdicts in the highly
 publicized trial of Tony Davis and the Oklahoma Information Exchange.  There
 are a couple of other articles, including an update for BBS Basics.

 The Board of Trade BBS, the home of the Pasco BBS Magazine, also celebrates
 two years on-line during June.  Thanks to the people who have made running
 the BBS an enjoyable experience.  Stop by and say Hi!

 Florida - Australia Linkup
 --------------------------

 On Saturday morning May 14, 1994 the Inner Sanctum BBS in New Port Richey,
 Florida, featured a linkup with a couple of bulletin boards in Florida and
 several boards in Australia.  While it was Saturday morning in Florida, it was
 Saturday night in Australia.  Rob Marlowe, Sysop of the Inner Sanctum BBS, has
 been linking up with the Beach Board in Fort Myers, Florida for a weekly live
 chat, but this was the first scheduled linkup live with the land down under.
 Things went so well that Rob says they will try to have the Australian linkup
 on a regular basis.

 What follows is the written transcript recorded live, on-line, during this
 international linkup.  Sometimes in an on-line chat the questions and answers
 do not follow each other directly, so the conversations have been grouped by
 topic.  The session was also edited for length and the format changed
 slightly.  But other than that, this is the exact text as it happened.  Below
 are the codes for the bulletin board the person was on during the linkup.

               IS - Inner Sanctum BBS, New Port Richey, FL
               KK - Kakadu Konnection, Darwin, Australia
               CG - Common Ground BBS, Adelaide, Australia
               SA - Oracle BBS, Adelaide, Australia
               WA - 1990 Multiline, Western Australia
               BB - Beach Board, Fort Myers, FL

 The discussion begins with the BBS codes everyone was trying to figure out.

 Tom Koltai (KK): Perth will come back in when they have another free line.  SA
 & CG are in ADEALAIDE

 OIE Update
 ----------

 Last July the Oklahoma City Police Department raided the Oklahoma Information
 Exchange (OIE) to confiscate pornographic CD Rom disks, and the plight of
 Sysop Tony Davis has received considerable publicity.  The trial in the case
 of The State of Oklahoma v. Tony Davis came to a conclusion on May 5.  Anyone
 who has, or is considering, adult material on their bulletin board should be
 interested in the results.  Tony Davis was found guilty on all counts, and now
 faces 35 years in jail and $33,000 in fines.  The story may not be over, as
 Davis has filed a counter-suit against the Oklahoma City Police Department and
 appeals are expected.  Here are the counts, verdicts and sentences in the
 case.

          scientific value, contrary to the provisions of Section 1021 of Title

 PSA Update
 ----------

 The Pasco Sysop's Association seemed to get quite a bit accomplished at the
 May general meeting.  The By-Laws Committee presented the proposed by-laws to
 the membership, which were approved with relatively little discussion.  The
 Events Committee gave an update on their progress, and the membership voted on
 a time and place for the first PSA sponsored event.

 The by-laws, which follow this article, were a major step for the association.
 The newly approved by-laws are very loose, allowing for easy modifications and
 placing virtually no restrictions on member boards.  There had been some talk
 that the Executive Board had made too many decisions at their first meeting,
 so the by-laws made no mention of the Executive Officers.  After approving the
 by-laws, a vote was taken and the Executive Board was dissolved.  The general
 feeling was that the Executive Board was a good idea to get PSA started, but
 that the association turned out to be a little top heavy.  So, the PSA now has
 only a President, Vice President and a Secretary.  The former officers, Bernie
 Koch, Rob Marlowe, Clark Gilbo and Floyd Cordery, were thanked for their
 efforts and willingness to serve.  President Dave Anderson encouraged the
 membership to review the by-laws and bring any suggestions to the next
 meeting.

 The Events Committee presented several dates and locations for a PSA picnic.
 The membership voted to hold a pot-luck picnic as the first PSA sponsored
 event.  The picnic, which is open to PSA members and bulletin board users
 alike, will be held on June 25, 1994.  The event will take place at Veteran's
 Memorial Park, Hudson, Florida, starting at 11:00 am and running throughout
 the afternoon.

 The next PSA meeting is scheduled for July 5 at the Hudson Library.  President
 Dave Anderson expressed an interest in the possibility of moving future
 meetings to less formal surroundings.  At this point, there appears to be a
 consensus to keep the PSA primarily a social gathering.  The primary objective
 seems to be to keep the infant association from falling apart.  But, if one of
 the goals is to keep the lines of communications open between local boards,
 that may have been accomplished.

 Dvorak's Guide to PC Telecommunications Review
 ----------------------------------------------

 John Dvorak is one of the most well known computer columnists with articles
 appearing in several magazines including PC Magazine and Boardwatch Magazine.
 John Dvorak and Nick Anis have teamed up to write a comprehensive guide to
 personal telecommunications, which should give the reader just about
 everything they need to jump on the information superhighway.

 Dvorak's Guide to PC Telecommunications begins with a history of telephones
 and telecommunications, moves on to how to install modems and software, and
 goes into detail on just about every aspect of the on-line world.  There are
 chapters on Electronic Mail, The BBS Scene, Virus and Protection, Shareware,
 the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and many other topics.  There
 are even chapters on Running A BBS and on BBS Software.  Included is a disk
 with several popular Shareware programs, such as the Telix communications
 program and McAfee Associates' anti-virus utilities.  There are also coupons
 for discounts on dozens of other on-line related products.

 The book is quite informative and is enjoyable reading for just about every
 level of experience.  Some may balk at the $39.95 retail price for a
 paperback, but the 1,128 page book may answer many questions for the person
 who is new to telecommunications.

 BBS Basics
 ----------

 What is a ZIP file?

 The majority of the files found on bulletin boards are in the archive format,
 which always gives the novice BBS user problems with the first few downloads.
 Most people log on a board and download some great sounding program and cannot
 figure out how to get it to work.  This leads to more calls to the boards,
 reading bulletins or paging Sysops, in an attempt to find out how to use this
 file they cannot wait to try.  Since most bulletin boards use files with a
 .ZIP extension, users learn quickly about file compression.

 Why are almost all files on bulletins boards found in the compressed, or
 archive, format?  There are basically two reasons.  One reason is to compress
 the file's size, thus reducing the amount of time it takes to transfer the
 file via the modem connection.  The other reason is to group all the files
 necessary to operate the program under a single name, so the caller does not
 have to download a bunch of different files to get one program to run.

 There are many different authors who have released archive programs, but the
 .ZIP format archive is by far the most common in the BBS world.  Other
 file extensions include .ARJ, .LZH, .PAK, .ARC, .ICE, .ZOO, among others.
 When these programs are downloaded they come in a self-extracting format, so
 you do not have to know any complicated commands to extract the files.  Just
 type the file's name and the program will extract itself, provided that there
 is enough disk space.  Each archive utility includes complete documentation on
 the program's operation.

 The commands for each archive utility differ slightly, but it is a relatively
 simple command line for extracting files from .ZIP files.  The best thing to
 do is to place the archive utility's executable files, for example PKUNZIP.EXE
 and PKZIP.EXE, in your system's path.  It is unfortunate, but most DOS manuals
 do not give a very good explanation of how the path works.  By putting the
 utilities in your path, the commands will work anywhere on your system
 including diskette drives, so the utility does not have to be in the current
 directory to operate.  Your root directory is always on your system's path, so
 copying PKUNZIP.EXE to C:\ will work if you do not have a thorough
 understanding of DOS's path.  However, it is better to place all the utilities
 you wish to use universally on your system in a directory, for example C:\BIN,
 since a cluttered root directory will slow down your system somewhat.  The
 path statement, which can be edited with any text editor, is found in your
 AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  In the above example, you would add C:\BIN to the end of
 the path statement, but remember to separate all directories on the path with
 a semi-colon.  For example:

                  Old path    -    PATH C:\;C:\DOS
                  New path    -    PATH C:\;C:\DOS;C:\BIN

 If a file named PBM.ZIP was downloaded, the following is an example of how you
 would extract the files you just downloaded.

                           PKUNZIP PBM C:\HOLD

 The above assumes that you wish to extract the files within PBM.ZIP to a
 directory called C:\HOLD.  PBM could be replaced with any file name you might
 download and it is not necessary to type the .ZIP extension.  C:\HOLD could
 also be replaced with the directory of your choice, or if you want to extract
 the files to the directory where PBM.ZIP currently resides, leave the
 directory off and just type PKUNZIP PBM.

 There are other commands and many features included with the popular archive
 utilities, but this should get those first downloads unziped.

 Editor's Note:  BBS Basics is available as a menu driven executable program
 and contains all kinds of information for the new BBS user.  The current
 version is 2.0, and as we add and revise sections for future versions, the
 text will first appear in the Pasco BBS Magazine.  Look for BBS Basics in
 future issues and look for the file BBSBAS20.ZIP on better BBSs everywhere.

 An Interesting Theory
 ---------------------

 SYSOP NEWS...and CyberWorld Report is a relatively new publication, now with a
 couple of issues under its belt.  In a Guest Editorial in the May issue, Sam
 Thompson has a very interesting theory about why the media continues to
 present a tainted view of bulletin boards.  His is an idea I had not really
 thought about before, but it does make sense.

 Mr. Thompson speculates that companies like MCI, TCI, Time-Life and Turner
 Broadcasting are afraid of the competition from BBSs, and that these privately
 owned boards will hamper the corporate plans to take over the information
 superhighway.  Not only are bulletin boards already providing the services
 that these companies are promising, but they are doing it at a fraction of the
 cost to the consumer.  Bulletin boards are also more responsive to user's
 needs, and modifications and improvements to the system can be made much
 quicker than the huge national services can ever hope to accomplish.  Bulletin
 boards are a perceived threat, so this is why the major media only covers the
 negative aspects.  Of course, the primary reason behind all of this is money.
 So the media portrays bulletin boards, as Mr. Thompson so eloquently put it,
 as a place where perverts are in charge.

 Think about it the next time you see one of those one-sided, sensationalized
 stories that the media is famous for.  Those of use who blamed it on the media
 being simply uninformed, may have been a bit naive.  Maybe, Mr. Thompson's
 theory deserves some consideration.

 Next Month
 ----------

 The July issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine will have a feature on a new FidoNet
 program for PCBoard called QFront, and we will talk with the author of this
 revolutionary new program.  Next month will also look at a bulletin board run
 by the State Department designed to provide information for international
 travelers.

 There are other articles in the works and, hopefully, we will have a few
 surprises.  Look for the July issue of the Pasco BBS, which will be released
 on, or before, June 22.

 Corrections and Clarifications
 ------------------------------

 I have noticed some typos, which have slipped through during the first year
 and half of doing the magazine.  Just last month Dave Anderson, President of
 the Pasco Sysop's Association, was referred to as "President Dave."  No matter
 how much proof reading takes place, mistakes like that will be found from time
 to time.  If you see major mistakes, such as incorrect phone numbers or mis-
 spelled names, please let us know.  In such cases, the appropriate correction
 will be run.
