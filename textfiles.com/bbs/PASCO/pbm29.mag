 Editor's Welcome
 ----------------

 Last year's September issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine covered educational
 Shareware programs, as it seemed to be an appropriate time with school
 starting up again.  This year we say the heck with school and offer the First
 Annual Gaming Issue!  This issue is our largest yet and includes the Complete
 Catalog of Shareware Games with a look at over 150 of the most popular games.
 For those who might have associated gaming with casino gambling, which is what
 I think of when I hear the word gaming, there is an article on How Computers
 Changed Blackjack.  There is also an article on Doom and the latest BBS news.

 Thanks go out to Rob Marlowe at that the Inner Sanctum BBS for sending us an
 update on the TBBS BBS software.  I would like to encourage other Sysops to
 send us updates and articles, we will be more than happy to run a free ad for
 anyone who submits an article.  Articles do not have to be lengthy, as even a
 couple of paragraphs would be great.  You do not have to be Sysop to write
 something.  Users can get free access to the Board of Trade BBS, the home of
 the Pasco BBS Magazine, for submitting articles.

 This issue is being released virtually on the eve of ONE BBSCON '94, which
 should be the largest gathering of BBS operators in history.  If you have read
 any of the BBS magazines around, it might seem like that is all that people
 are talking about.  And with good reason, it should be an incredible event.
 The BBSCON has even affected the release date of the Pasco BBS Magazine.  This
 issue was released earlier in the month than any other previous issue, so it
 would be published prior to the convention and allow more time for complete
 coverage in our October issue.  Make sure you read next month's issue!

 Thanks for reading!

 How Computers Changed Blackjack
 -------------------------------

 The popular card game of Blackjack has been around for hundreds of years, but
 it took the invention of the computer to discover that this is one game which
 can be beaten.  The game played in American casinos is actually called twenty-
 one, based on the French game of Vingt-Et-Un.  Blackjack is where the deal
 passes to another player when they get a Blackjack, or a natural two-card
 twenty-one.  In casinos the house always keeps the deal.

 If you have been around a casino, or played the dice game craps, you have most
 likely heard the phase "the dice have no memory."  This is true because what
 happens on the previous rolls has no effect on what numbers come up next.  The
 odds on rolling a seven remain 1 in 6, no matter what has been rolled
 previously.  You will hear gamblers say that a point is due, the odds are in
 the favor of it, but the fact is that the odds are the same no matter what was
 rolled before.  The same point can made about the lottery, as people chart
 winning numbers and all that, but the odds are the same every week for any
 combination of numbers (even if it hit the week before).  Craps and the
 lottery are completely random selection, and as such, what happened before is
 irrelevant.

 In twenty-one, however, the cards that have been played do make a difference
 and this has led many to develop sophisticated card counting systems to track
 the previously played cards.  For example if all the tens are already used up
 in the deck, the player is at a disadvantage because the profitability of
 doubling double and the chance of the dealer busting have been greatly
 reduced.  This article will not go into the details of card counting, but it
 is a fascinating reality which still frightens the casinos today.

 Some of the early computer pioneers realized that Blackjack was a game based
 on the mathematical theory of probably and not pure random chance.  Edward O.
 Thorp wrote "Beat the Dealer" in 1962 with the help of computer experts and
 this was the book which revealed the secrets of Blackjack.  The book laid out
 a "basic strategy" for playing the game based on thousands of computer
 simulated hands.  Players using just this strategy could actually play at a
 slight advantage, even if they didn't count cards.  New concepts like
 doubling-down on "soft" hands when the dealer had a bad card showing startled
 the industry, and show dealers today that at least you know the game.  The
 casinos reacted quickly to change some rules, like no more doubling down on
 eleven or splitting of aces.  The problem was even the uninformed players
 didn't like the changes, so the casinos figured they would make enough off the
 hack players to cover what the others were winning, and switched back to most
 of the old rules.

 Basic Strategy is not a "system," but is based on computer analysis, here are
 some highlights (soft is when an ace is counted as eleven, hard is when an ace
 is counted as one or no ace, face cards are considered tens).  The priority is
 spilt, double, soft stand and hard stand.

  When to Split Pairs                            When to Soft Double

 A,A   - Always                                 A,7 - Dealer has 3 thru 6
 10,10 - Never                                  A,6 - Dealer has 3 thru 6
 9,9   - Dealer has 2 thru 6,8,9                A,5 - Dealer has 4 thru 6
 8,8   - Always                                 A,4 - Dealer has 4 thru 6
 7,7   - Dealer has 2 thru 7                    A,3 - Dealer has 5, 6
 6,6   - Dealer has 3 thru 6                    A,2 - Dealer has 5, 6
 5,5   - Never
 4,4   - Never
 3,3   - Dealer has 4 thru 7                     Standing Numbers (Soft)
 2,2   - Dealer has 4 thru 7
                                                19 - Dealer has 9,10, A
                                                18 - Dealer has 2 thru 8
  When to Hard Double

 11 - Always                                      Standing Numbers (Hard)
 10 - Dealer has 2 thru 10
  9 - Dealer has 2 thru 6                       17 - Dealer has 7 thru A
                                                13 - Dealer has 2,3
                                                12 - Dealer has 4 thru 6

 Some of the early pioneers really cleaned up before the casinos caught on.  It
 was the computer which lead to the breakthrough.  Today there are many
 excellent computer programs which teach basic strategy and counting, and allow
 a player to practice without having to suffer the financial loses that come
 with learning the game at the casino.  One very nice Shareware program,
 Blackjack by Donald L. Granger, not only teaches basic strategy but several
 popular counting methods as well.

 A Look at Doom
 --------------

 Written by Alex Thomas, editor of GamePlay, New Port Richey, FL

 Heeeeello!  Guess what?  No, not chicken butt.  The editor is writing this
 column!  Hey, come back here!  OOOOOOOK... Well, anyway, this article here is
 about DOOM, the awesome new game by ID!  I'll be telling you about the good,
 the bad, and the ugly (just kidding... I'll also be telling you how the game
 plays on other systems).

 To start off:  If you read the rest of GamePlay (yes, all of it) you'll notice
 we seem to be hyping Doom.  Well, gee golly gosh, you're absotively,
 posolutely right!  (I messed up the absolutely, positively thing on purpose.)
 Anyhoo, let me tell you why... (why were hyping Doom, not why I messed up the
 absolutely thing.  I don't know why, anyway.)  We're hyping Doom, not because
 it's better than Blake Stone, not because ID is paying us to, (although they
 should...) but because: (drum roll, please) It's just an incredibly well-done
 program (to say the least).

 Firstly, I'd like to tell you why it's bad (using the term "bad" VERY
 loosely):  I've noticed, even on my 486 which runs at an incredible 90 Mhz
 (amazing, isn't it?) that I still have to use a boot-up disk, and it runs a
 little slow in the introduction.  Also, you're killing poor, innocent
 monsters, who are only trying to take over the Earth, unlike Wolfenstein
 where you kill Nazi sleezebags who knew better and were also trying to take
 over the Earth.  (I find killing Nazis much more entertaining.)  Other than
 these "flaws", the game is GOLDEN!

 Now, for those of you who have never played Doom (poor, unfortunate souls)
 I'll tell you the requirements and really good parts!

 Requirements:  Doom requires these as a bare minimum!  A 386 or higher (no
 kidding, unlike some programs that claim you need a 386 but can be easily
 played on a 286), 4 megabytes of RAM, at least VGA, and a sound card (you can
 still play if you don't have a sound card, but it'll just be in constant
 mute).  (No fun, because you can't hear the blood-curdling screams of dying
 monsters, or the grunts and groans in the darkness of the shadows ahead, or
 the satisfying sound of the machine gun pumping a few rounds of lead into a
 monster screaming in bitter agony, or...  I could go on for days, but this has
 to be released soon, so I haven't got the time... I think you get the picture,
 anyway.)

 And here are the good parts:  I've already described the sounds above, so I'll
 try to describe the graphics.  Imagine this:  You walk down the hall from
 which you've just exited from a tunnel, the glittering of green ectoplasm
 coming from waste barrels your only light.  You walk farther, knowing you MUST
 find an end to this never-ending world of deadly monsters.  While imagining
 the end of this eternal living hell, you suddenly hear, and practically feel
 breathe on the back of your neck.  Quickly turning around, you discover a
 wandering grunt, sending you your demise in the form of a futuristic shotgun.
 With your trusty GM chain saw you slice through his meaningless life, not to
 mention his ugly deformed body.  His shotgun untouched, you take it with you,
 possibly the only thing preserving your life.  Farther down the dank tunnel,
 you sense light.  It's getting brighter!  Is this the End?  No, but you do get
 out of the dismal buildings to finally breath fresh air not enclosed by the
 smell of death.  Far, far away you can see looming mountains covered with
 freshly fallen snow.  You've traveled so far, only to regain the feeling of
 this mission never ending.  But now, after you've found the awesome missile
 launcher, blowing away these vile creatures seems to turn into a game.  The
 feeling does not last for long.  Not after you re-enter darkness, where there
 is almost no penetration of light.  You guide yourself by the light expelled
 by squeezing off a round on your missile launcher, knowing all too well that
 every shot used is sparing another life of a monster who could kill you later.
 You use your shots sparingly, sometimes wandering through complete darkness.
 Suddenly, red eyes in which you don't know the body to (and probably wouldn't
 want to) abound all around you, coming closer.  Furiously you lay waste to
 three creatures, hearing their screams of death with pleasure.  It's not
 enough, though.  For every pair of eyes you destroy, two more seem to appear.
 Again you waste shots, firing in any direction, every direction, hoping to
 take down as many pairs of red eyes as possible.  Several more screams from
 dying demons later you realize, with panic, that your missile launcher seems
 to be clicking.  You're out of ammo!  You drop your launcher and pull out a
 mini-gun, hoping to take down the rest of the monsters with what's left in the
 way of ammo supply.  Seconds later, which, in the heat of total panic, seem
 like decades, the final creature goes down.  For now...  If you've ever felt
 anything like this, even remotely, you've played Doom.

 I'd like to finish this section by writing about:  ME!  I'm 12, 5 foot, 7
 inches, and weigh, well... a lot  (but I'm not a blimp, and I don't watch Home
 Shopping Club).  Someday I hope to become a writer, or computer graphics
 artist.  I hope you liked the above article.  I have a strange tendency to use
 parenthesis, (I don't know why).  That was a joke.  Get it?  I used
 parenthesis to say "I don't know why."  Get it?  Laugh.  I think I use
 parenthesis so I can give you my personal thoughts or things that don't quite
 fit in with the regular text.  If I've insulted anybody by any of my writings,
 I don't mean to.  I'm opposite than a lot of people because I can express
 myself much easier by writing than talking.  I always say the wrong stuff when
 I talk, so I don't do a lot of talking, except to close friends  (like the
 president, of GamePlay, not of the United States.  I hate Clinton, anyway.)
 Now, see, I MEANT to insult the U.S. president in that one.

 I promised you I'd tell you about Doom coming out on other systems.  I bet you
 didn't even know it WAS coming out on other systems.  Well, it is.  But only
 one.  Doom will be coming out on the new Jaguar system by Atari.  The Jaguar
 system is capable of 64 bits!  Sixty-four bits.  Wo.  The highest bits game
 I've ever played is Zone 66, and is only 32 bits.  Wo.  Anyway, despite the
 awesome graphics, Doom for the PC is only 8 bits in graphics!  Amazing!  When
 Doom comes out for Jaguar, it is said to have 16 bits, which is practically a
 maximum for a game its size.  And because of its enormous size, SNES, and Sega
 Genesis aren't even going to waste time trying to make a version of Doom.  So,
 if you're reading this on someone else's computer, and you don't have a Jaguar
 or aren't planning on getting one, you won't get the awesome experience of
 playing: Doom.

 OK, now my very first public writing is at an end.  (Hey! Stop cheering!  It
 wasn't THAT bad! Geez.)  And so I end this article o' mine by saying:  CYA!

 Editor's Note:  The above article is from a pre-release version of Best
 Shareware Games 8.0.  This new version is scheduled to be released under the
 name GamePlay and will also have a menu system and graphics.  Look for more
 from Paul Pollack and Alex Thomas in future issues of the Pasco BBS Magazine.

 TBBS 2.3 Announced
 ------------------

 By Rob Marlowe, Sysop Inner Sanctum BBS, New Port Richey, FL

 eSoft, makers of the popular TBBS bulletin board software, have announced the
 impending release of TBBS version 2.3.  This maintenance release will provide
 better handling of file transfers, provide hooks for a future message system
 upgrade to get around the 65000 message limitation of the current software,
 provide more memory headroom for option modules (such as the QWK mail module
 that is currently limited to the old version of ZIP compression), and an
 increase in speed, allowing the release of a new 96 line version.

 The new minimum TBBS system will go from two lines to four lines.  With some
 option modules using "ghost" lines, the old two line version simply became too
 small for any but the smallest BBS.

 Arriving at the same time as TBBS 2.3 will be eSoft's IPAD or Internet
 Protocol Adapter.  The IPAD, to be shown off at ONE BBSCON in Atlanta, will
 allow TBBS systems to install "full" Internet connections, including both
 inbound and outbound sessions over the connection with speeds up to that
 provided by a T1 high speed line.

 Rob Marlowe, Sysop of the Inner Sanctum - the only area TBBS system, was
 understandably thrilled to hear about the new release of TBBS.  "The new
 minimum line count doesn't do much for our 10 line system, but the other
 changes will certainly help us, especially the speedup now that V.34 modems
 are right around the corner."  Marlowe declined to speculate on when the Inner
 Sanctum might sport an IPAD.

 To see a TBBS system in action, give the Inner Sanctum BBS a call at (813)
 848-6055.

 Editor's Note:  Thanks to Rob Marlowe for the update.  Sysops are encouraged
 to send along articles about their particular BBS Software, and will get a
 free ad for their efforts.

 PSA Update
 ----------

 The Pasco Sysops Association had its best turnout in several months at the
 August general meeting, as at least twenty people showed up for the August 2
 meeting.  All the discussion about moving the meetings to the local Hooters
 restaurant appeared to renew interest in the organization.  While general
 discussion dominated, and no major business was discussed, it was refreshing
 to have a good turnout.  The future of the PSA may still be an unknown factor,
 but the reality that the organization has been around for six months is a
 major hurdle which has been cleared.  The Pasco BBS Magazine will continue to
 keep you updated on the Pasco Sysops Association.

 QFront 1.10 Released
 --------------------

 In the July issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine, Rob Kittridge talked about the
 upcoming release of version 1.10 of his popular QFront program.  The latest
 version of this revolutionary program for handling FidoNet mail on PCBoard
 based systems was released on August 8.  Here are just some of the new
 features in this most recent version:

 - QFConfig (the configuration program) has been rewritten to be more user
   friendly.  A help line displayed at the bottom of the screen for each option
   and there is context-sensitive help available by pressing F1.  You can now
   shell out of QFConfig by pressing ALT-S.

 - QScan has been rewritten to run using less memory.  The Areafix manager has
   been rewritten and now Areafix forwarding is included.  Areafix requests
   have tighter security.  There is support for file attachments in the NetMail
   Conference and enhanced duplicate message checking.

 - QNList has added a new "personal nodelist" editor and you can run your whole
   system using just a personal nodelist.  NODEDIFF updates are now built-in.

 - QFront itself has had many modifications to the call-waiting screen.  Queue
   routines can repeated.  There is additional node activity information
   available, including mail statistics, number of callers and a history of
   node addresses which have connected in a specified number of days.  The
   event manager has been rewritten to support up to 100 events per node.
   QFront is now more compatible with OS/2 and DESQview multitasking
   environments.  There is stronger support for magic file names, UserNet
   messages and NetMail forwarding.  You can now shell out of QFront from
   anywhere by pressing ALT-S.

 - QFUtil is a new program that allows you to add queue entries to the queue
   directly from the DOS command line.

 These are just some of the highlights of this new release.  For more
 information call the support board for QFront.  The 7th Heaven BBS can be
 reached at (616) 844-0713.  This phone number will be changing in early
 September and we will update that in next month's issue.
