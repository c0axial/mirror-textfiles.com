     Information on how to become a Pasco BBS Magazine Distribution Site


 General Information
 -------------------

 The Pasco BBS Magazine is an electronic magazine which is distributed free
 every month.  Having Distribution Sites gives an added flavor to the
 magazine, as many times articles will be written on unique features a
 Distribution Site has to offer.  The sites also help with exposure, as not
 everyone calls around to a lot of long-distance bulletins boards.  It is not
 a bad deal for the Distribution Sites, as these boards will probably get a
 few more calls, get free ads in the magazine and some extra publicity.

 It was originally intended for each Distribution Site to receive a free ad
 in every issue, but unfortunately there can only be a limited number of ads
 in each issue.  As more Distribution Sites are named, the frequency of ads
 will have to be reduced.  Distribution Sites will always receive an ad the
 month they are named, but after that, there is no guarantee space will allow
 an ad every month.  Remember, a complete list of the Distribution Sites will
 always run at the beginning of every issue and each month all sites, which
 submit one, will have an ad in the BBS Log.  Advertising space is limited,
 so the editor makes all determinations on which ads will run.  Ads should be
 forwarded to the Board of Trade BBS.  It is preferred that ads for the
 magazine not exceed 23 lines.  The Pasco BBS Magazine cannot be held
 responsible for information contained within ads.  All ads remain the
 property of their owners.

 The Distribution Sites are granted an area exclusively, which is normally
 meant to imply a city.  It is difficult to guarantee that two sites could
 not fall within the same calling area, as local calling areas vary widely
 across the country.

 The editor will attempt to upload the magazine to the Distribution Sites, so
 these boards will be the first to receive every issues.  Sometimes it may be
 better to call the Board of Trade BBS, especially if your board is "busy"
 and as the number of Distribution Sites increases.

 Rules and Guidelines
 --------------------

 Distribution Sites:

                ş Must not engage in illegal activity

                ş Must post current issue as a bulletin or door

                ş Must have all issues (current and past)
                  available for downloading

                ş Must allow free downloading of the magazine
                  (this doesn't necessarily mean a free board)

 Other things boards could do to become, or remain, a Distribution Site:

                ş Have "Pasco BBS Magazine Distribution Site"
                  on log-on or welcome screen

                ş Post the magazine as a color bulletin

                ş Create a Pasco BBS Magazine File Directory

                ş Forward submissions to the Board of Trade BBS

                ş Upload magazine around local calling area

 It is possible, only with the consent of the editor, that one of the first
 four conditions may be waived (with the obvious exception of engaging in
 illegal activity).  Special consideration may also be given on ads.  It is
 the objective to have a stable list of Distribution Sites, but sometimes
 things change.  The Pasco BBS Magazine is not responsible for the activities
 of the Distribution Sites.
