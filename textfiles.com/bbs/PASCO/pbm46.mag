 Editor's Welcome
 ----------------

 Thank you for taking the time to check out this month's Pasco BBS Magazine!

 June 1 begins the 1996 hurricane season, so this month's issue features a look
 at some hurricane tracking programs available in the on-line world.  Here in
 Florida, and other hurricane prone areas, we certainly hope that the 1996
 season is not nearly as active as last year.  There is also a look at the
 Federal Emergency Management Agency's home page on the World Wide Web.  I have
 personally been spending a bit more time exploring the Web, so look for future
 issues to have more about the WWW.

 Game expert Paul Pollack has part one of a two part article on Heretic level
 design, and Ed Garwood is back with more Computer Basics.  Along with all our
 regular features, BBS Basics features an updated version of "What is a BBS?"
 There is also a short article on a new on-line publication called the Hernando
 BBS Magazine.  I certainly want to wish editor David Coburn all the luck in
 the world with this endeavor.

 Thanks for reading!

 Hurricane Tracking Programs
 ---------------------------

 When cable television's The Weather Channel gives the latest coordinates for a
 hurricane or tropical storm, the announcer will frequently say something like
 "here is the latest position for those of you tracking at home."  There was a
 time when tracking at home meant plotting the storm's path with a pencil on a
 paper map.  Today, there are several computer programs available in the
 on-line world to make the task of storm tracking much easier and far more
 enjoyable.  These types of programs have increased the number of people,
 especially in hurricane prone areas, who are tracking tropical weather
 systems.

 This article takes a look at some of the readily available storm tracking
 programs found in the Shareware, or Freeware, markets.  Everyone has their own
 opinion on what type of features they feel are important, or how the look and
 feel of such a program should be, so this article will not try to decide which
 program is the best effort.  That decision will be left up to individual
 preference.

 Hurricane (DOS) - Written by Eric Scott Hunsader
 This program has the option of displaying an unlimited number of storms, with
 an animated track, on the same map.  There are three maps to choose from,
 Atlantic, Caribbean and Pacific, with the Atlantic and Pacific maps giving a
 very wide hemispheric view.  The grid map option shows how many times storms
 have passed through certain areas.  The program will work with most monitors.

 Hurricane Tracking System (Windows) - Written by James Culbertson
 This program displays storm tracks on a single map, which does not show much
 of the eastern Atlantic.  You can maneuver around the map, or use the shrink
 and grow option.  The storm path is plotted with colored balls at each
 advisory.  Yellow is for tropical storms and red is for hurricanes, the larger
 the ball the higher the category of hurricane.  The program includes
 "Hurricane Safety Tips."

 HurrTrak (DOS) - Written by George Sambataro
 This program, distributed by PC Weather Products, has four maps, two of the
 Atlantic and two of the Caribbean.  Storm paths are displayed as colored
 lines.  The "History System" features a historical database of storms, which
 can be selected by location, storm name, year, or intensity.  Using the
 History System, an unlimited number of storms may be displayed on the same
 map.  There is also the option to display storm formation points, and a nice
 graph displaying barometric pressure and wind speed.  The program's graphics
 are not as intense as some of the other tracking program.  While it was not
 available for review, there is also a Windows version of HurrTrak.

 Merlin Hurricane Tracking Tool (DOS) - Written by Ted Parker
 This program plots storm tracks as multi-colored lines on one of five maps.
 The maps are of the Gulf of Mexico, East Coast, Atlantic, Caribbean and the
 "original" Merlin map.  Wind fields can be displayed, along with the National
 Hurricane Center's 72 hour forecast.  There is also a loop which will
 continuously display the storm track, the current advisory and a user created
 text file.  Most program functions are one button operations.

 Storm (DOS) - Written by Thomas Pesek
 This program displays an animated storm following the track on a fixed wide
 view map.  The storm's intensity may be displayed in different colors and up
 to four storm tracks can be displayed on one map.  There is a storm summary
 which gives pertinent information as it relates to the user defined tracking
 site.  This program features a regular and enhanced version and registration
 brings something called "Storm Genie."

 Tracking the Eye (Windows) - Written by GenCode Technologies of Tampa
 This Freeware program was written specifically for spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov and
 features a fixed map.  The animation option displays an animated storm
 following the track.  While the storm is being animated on the map, the names
 of the threatened cities will turn from yellow to red.  There is a very nice
 hurricane shopping list where you can check a box when that item is purchased.

 WinStorm (Windows) - Written by David C. Ingram
 This program plots a storm's track on a single map with the option to "shrink"
 and "unshrink" the map size.  Once the path is plotted, an animated hurricane
 can be displayed to follow the track.  The storm track may be displayed with
 different colors based on the storm's intensity.  The placement of grid lines
 on the map is also an option.  There is an optional warning window, which can
 be displayed at a user defined distance from the location of their choice.
 The program has the ability to display the pressure in either inches or
 millibars.

 Several other storm tracking programs have been listed in weather related
 publications, however, they could not be located for inclusion in this
 article.  These programs include Force12 by Epperson Computing, GCanes by
 Robert Terwilliger, Hurricane Forecaster by Craig Rorrer, Hurricane Tracker by
 Nicheware, Hurricane Watch! by SeaBorne Systems, TrakHur by Bryan Lambeth and
 Tracker by OceanSoft Inc.

 Federal Emergency Management Agency Web Page
 --------------------------------------------

 The Federal government continues to be a strong advocate of using on-line
 technology to disseminate information.  Several of the most popular sites on
 the Internet's World Wide Web are maintained by the U.S. government.
 http://www.whitehouse.gov, the home page for the White House, may be the most
 well known Web page around.  htp://www.nasa.gov, the National Aeronautics and
 Space Administration's home page, and http://nhc.noaa.gov, the National
 Hurricane Center's home page, are also very popular sites.  This article takes
 a brief look at http://fema.gov, which is the home page for the Federal
 Emergency Management Agency.

 The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) springs into action when a
 major disaster strikes.  When a hurricane landfalls, a bomb explodes, or any
 other major disaster hits which is beyond the scope of the local community,
 FEMA personnel are sent to the area to help with the recovery efforts.  After
 the President issues a disaster declaration, FEMA will reimburse local
 governments for expenses, provide low interest loans to businesses and private
 citizens devastated in the disaster, and lend other recovery assistance.  FEMA
 performs a wide range of disaster and emergency management related functions.
 In an "effort to enhance the exchange of information and communication between
 FEMA and the Public," they have set up a home page on the World Wide Web.  In
 times of disaster, the activity on this page picks up.

 When you log into fema.gov, you will find a digitized image of FEMA personnel
 responding to a disaster scene.  There is also a photograph of FEMA Director
 James Lee Witt and a message from the Director.  This message may be read on
 screen, or is available as a 528k audio file.  James Lee Witt's welcome
 begins, "As all of us know, disasters are terrible.  They can rob people of
 the basic necessities of life -- things like food, shelter, health or a way to
 earn a living.  In a matter of minutes, they can devastate an entire
 community.  There is so much that can be done to prevent or reduce the impact
 of disasters.  As outlined in its mission statement and in its vision for the
 future, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, works to reduce risks,
 strengthen support systems and help people and their communities prepare for
 and cope with disasters regardless of cause."

 To learn more about FEMA check out their Web page, which is full of
 information about the agency and its services.  Since our tax dollars are
 paying for this service, there are no fees associated with logging in.  As
 time goes on, even more information will be made available on this page.  In
 the attempt to become more cost effective, even more government services and
 information should be available on-line.

 Hernando BBS Magazine Introduced
 --------------------------------

 One of Pasco County's neighboring counties now has its own BBS related
 magazine, as the Hernando BBS Magazine was introduced on March 1, 1996.  This
 free on-line publication, which is a menu driven executable file, is scheduled
 to be released the first of each month.

 The Hernando BBS Magazine's editor is Spring Hill, Florida resident David
 Coburn, who is the Sysop of the Over There! BBS.  In the first issue, he wrote
 of some of the reasons he started this publication.  "This electronic magazine
 is published for only one reason, to enhance the enjoyment of all users and
 Sysops that maintain or call boards in Hernando County.  My hope in publishing
 this new electronic magazine is to bring the Hernando BBS community a little
 bit closer.  I encourage all local Sysops to support this magazine.  The
 future of it will depend on that support."

 The Hernando BBS Magazine publishes a list of the fourteen verified bulletin
 boards in that county and includes dialing directories for various
 communications programs.  Each issue has a door game review, announcements,
 editorials, ads and other BBS related features.  The "BBS Spotlight" takes a
 look at a different BBS each month.

 For more information on the Hernando BBS Magazine contact the Over There! BBS
 at (352) 666-9590, or contact the editor via Internet email at
 david.coburn@overthere.com.

 BBS Basics:  What is a BBS?
 ---------------------------

 Has this ever happened to you?  You mention to a friend, who is not into
 computers, that you call around to Bulletin Board Systems.  You get a blank
 stare in return.  That same friend could look in their dictionary to find out
 what a BBS or Bulletin Board System is, but their search will come up empty.
 While a growing number of people are becoming aware of what bulletin boards
 are, the above scenario remains realistic.  Yes, people still ask what is a
 BBS?

 The history of the BBS goes back to the Winter of 1978, when the first
 bulletin board software was written by Ward Christensen during a Chicago
 blizzard.  With his friend Randy Suess handling the hardware end of that first
 board, CBBS was officially born on February 16, 1978.  If you think that
 people today are not familiar with what a BBS is, imagine how many times Ward
 Christensen had to explain what this new creation was.  Christensen has
 commented, "A lot of people say 'oh, is that the Christensen Bulletin Board
 System or the Chicago Bulletin Board System?'  No, it's the Computerized
 Bulletin Board System, so we had to start kind of simple."

 An Electronic Bulletin Board System (or Service) is simply a computer hooked
 up to phone lines.  People may call the computer if their own computer has a
 modem and communications software.  A modem is a device which allows computers
 to talk to each other over the telephone lines.  The right communications
 software can make the job of connecting to a BBS quite simple.

 Today, bulletin board systems vary greatly.  From the small hobbyist to the
 big software companies support boards, each BBS has its own feel and selection
 of features.  Some may call themselves on-line services, or information
 services, but they are still bulletin boards.  Even America On-line,
 CompuServe, Prodigy and the MicroSoft Network are basically bulletin boards.
 However, the majority of the tens of thousands of bulletin boards available
 today are set up by hobbyists for their own enjoyment.

 Once one calls a BBS, a whole new world of information, services and fun opens
 up.  Bulletin boards are one of the best places to get the latest in software
 for your PC, most of the time before you can get the programs through disk
 vendors.  Callers can also leave messages to people who call the board or
 discuss issues with computer users all over the world.  Many BBSs have games
 which you can play, sometimes against other callers.  Some boards offer unique
 services which cannot be obtained anywhere else.  The system operator (Sysop
 for short) tries to have all the information you will need to get started
 posted somewhere on the board, but most are more than happy to answer any
 questions users might have.

 Editor's Note:  BBS Basics is a menu driven database of information for the
 new BBS user.  Version 2.1 of the Freeware program can be found on better BBSs
 everywhere.  As BBS Basics is updated for the next version, the articles will
 be published first in the Pasco BBS Magazine.

 Computer Basics
 ---------------

 Written by Ed Garwood, Hudson, FL

 DOS Commands

 Did you ever look at the list of DOS commands in your computer?  No?  Try it
 some day.  At the C:\ prompt, just type cd\DOS, and when the DOS prompt
 appears, type DIR/P.  You'll be treated to a whole string of DOS commands,
 ranging from ANSI.SYS to XXUNFRMT.EXE.  What do they all do?  Some are used
 quite often, while you may have no use for some of the others.  Should you
 know all about all of them?  Not really.  You probably won't have occasion to
 make use of more than 25% of them.

 There are two files which you won't find listed, because they are "hidden
 files."  Why hidden?  Probably so that you won't be tempted to play around
 with them.  Want to see them?  While in the DOS directory, type DIR /AH, and
 you'll see them listed:  IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS.  When you make a Boot Disk, they
 become an integral part, but again, they will be hidden.

 Which of these DOS files or commands might you be interested in, and how do
 you use them?  Read on!

 ANSI.SYS ¯ This is a device driver which will enhance your graphics display.
 For instance, if you want to change the colors of your start-up screen, you
 must have ANSI.SYS in your CONFIG.SYS File. The syntax is:

                        DEVICE=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS /x

 This can be the last line of your CONFIG.SYS file.

 ASSIGN ¯ Once in a great while, you may find a program is designed to run from
 the B: drive, and you only have an A: drive.  What to do?  Type ASSIGN B: =
 A:.  This fools the computer into thinking your B: drive is really your A:
 drive.  When you no longer have to fool the computer, just type ASSIGN by
 itself, and press <Enter>.  (Or re-boot your computer)

 ATTRIB ¯ Files can have one or more or four attributes:

             A=Archive     R=Read Only     H=Hidden     S=System

 A is Normal, and most files have that.  A Read only file (R) is just that.  It
 can only be read, not deleted or changed.  A hidden file (H) was described
 above.  A system File (S) is one which the computer uses for its operation.
 Don't mess with an H file or an S file.

 The only file which you would normally be interested in is the Read Only one.
 If you wish to delete it, you would first have to type ATTRIB -R Filename.Ext.
 If you want to protect a file so that it can't be accidentally deleted, just
 type ATTRIB +R filename.ext.  The + puts the attribute on.  A - takes it off.
 For instance, I have made ALL of my DOS files "Read Only".  I typed ATTRIB +R
 C:\DOS\*.* .  That did it.

 CD ¯ Change Directory.  To get the DOS directory, type cd\DOS

 CLS ¯  Type this command to Clear the Screen

 CHKDSK ¯ Use this to make sure a disk does not have bad sectors.  Type CHKDSK
 A: or CHKDSK C:.  You will see the report on the screen.

 COPY ¯ Used to copy individual files from one disk to another or from one
 directory to another.  For instance, to copy a file from your Wordperfect file
 to the A: drive, the syntax is:  Copy c:\wp\filename.ext A:

 DEFRAG ¯ This defragments the files on your hard disk to optimize the disk's
 performance, and speeds up operation.  There are a number of switches used
 with this command, so check your manual for the proper one to use.

 DEL ¯ The delete command.  Type DEL filename.ext.  (See also UNDELETE)

 DEVICE ¯ Used in the CONFIG.SYS file to instruct MS-DOS in the loading and use
 of special device drivers.  (i.e. as in ANSI.SYS above.)

 DISKCOPY ¯ This makes an exact copy of a floppy disk.  To copy a 3«" HD disk
 to another 3«" HD disk in the A: drive, type:

         DISKCOPY A: A:     Press <ENTER> and follow the prompts.

 DIR ¯ Display a directory list.  DIR/P lists the directory one screenful at a
 time.  DIR/W lists the files in an abbreviated form, 5 columns across.
 DIR/W/P gives the abbreviated form one screenful at a time.  DIR/A lists all
 files, including "Hidden files."  DIR/O lists files alphabetically,
 subdirectories first and then the individual files.  DIR/O:d lists files
 according to date, earliest first.

 ECHO ¯ Used in Batch files to permit or inhibit display of batch commands.

 EDIT ¯ An easy to use editing command.  For instance, if you wish to add the
 ANSI.SYS device command as discussed above, to your CONFIG.SYS file, you would
 type EDIT C:\CONFIG.SYS.  When the CONFIG.SYS file appeared on the screen, add
 the line shown.  Click on FILE, or press Alt and then the down arrow.  When
 the file window opens, type S to save the new file, and then press X to exit.
 (NOTE:  To use EDIT, you MUST also have QBASIC in your DOS Directory.)

 ERASE ¯ Use the DELETE command (see DEL above).

 EXIT ¯ To leave a secondary command processor.  For instance, if you have
 accessed DOS from Windows, EXIT will put you back into Windows.  If you have
 accessed a file from DOSHELL, EXIT will return you to the shell.

 FORMAT ¯ This command is used to format floppy disks.  To format a 5¬" DD
 floppy disk in A: drive, the syntax is FORMAT A:/4.  For a 3«" HD disk in
 Drive B:, Type FORMAT B:/144.  DO NOT USE THIS COMMAND TO FORMAT YOUR HARD
 DRIVE.

 HELP ¯ If you wish help on a DOS command, type HELP command.  If you can't
 think of the command, just type HELP, and you'll get a list of commands.  Use
 the TAB and arrow keys to highlight the command you wish and press Enter.

 LABEL ¯ (Also referred to as VOLUME).  When you want to label a floppy disk,
 type LABEL.  You can then type in a label not to exceed 11 characters.  You
 also get to label a disk after you have formatted it.

 LOADHIGH or LH ¯ Used to load certain programs into High Memory.  You must
 have HIMEM.SYS in you CONFIG.SYS file.  See your manual for usage.

 MD ¯ Make Directory.  Assume you want a temporary directory called TMP to
 store some temporary files.  At the C:\ prompt, type md TMP.

 MEM ¯ Typed alone, it shows you what memory is being used and where.

 MEMMAKER ¯ Optimizes your computer's memory by re-organizing device drivers
 and TSR's in the upper memory.  Very useful, but read your manual before
 trying it.

 MODE ¯ This command can be used in a number of different ways.  Some are:
 MODE 40 gives you double width characters on your screen.  MODE 80 puts them
 back to the normal 80 columns.  MODE CON Cols=C Lines=L gives 40 or 80
 columns, and 25, 43 or 50 lines on your screen.  C=40 or 80.  L=25,43, or 50
 MODE LPT1 does the same for your printer.  MODE also is used to set up Com
 Ports, Country pages, etc.

 MORE ¯ Causes your screen to display text one screenful at a time.  The Syntax
 is MORE < filename.ext.  It will also work with TYPE, and the syntax is TYPE
 filename.ext | MORE.  (The figure | is called a pipe and usually is found over
 the \ key.)

 MOVE ¯ Can be used to move files, directories, or to different drives.  Also
 renames directories.  See the Manual.

 MSD ¯ A diagnostic program, providing detailed information about your
 computer, software, and operating environment.  From the C:\ drive, type MSD
 and then follow the screen prompts.  Press F3 to exit MSD.

 PRINT ¯ Used to print-out text files, To print a text file, type PRINT
 filename.ext, and press enter.  (You may have to press <Enter> a second time
 to start the printer.)  For other uses of this command, see your manual.

 PROMPT ¯ This command sets the flashing prompt you see on your screen when you
 start up.  The default is $p$g, which means "show the current drive, and add
 the > sign."  To make your prompt read "C:\ Hello >" type PROMPT $p Hello $g.
 My own computer prompt reads "C:\ Ready >" and sets the characters to light
 green on a dark Blue screen.  To get this you type: PROMPT $e[32;44m $p Ready
 $g  (Note: You MUST have ANSI.SYS listed in your CONFIG.SYS file, to get the
 colors in.  See ANSI.SYS above.)

 QBASIC ¯ This is a Basic Interpreter, and is used for programming in BASIC.
 The EDIT Command used QBASIC, which is why you must have it in your DOS
 directory.

 RD ¯ Remove Directory.  Assume you made a TMP directory (see MD above), and
 now you wish to remove it.  First delete all the files in the directory, and
 then type cd\.  This brings you back to the root directory.  Now type RD TMP
 and the TMP directory is past history.

 REN ¯ Used to rename a file.  To change a file called BONGO.TXT to BINGO.TXT,
 type REN BONGO.TXT BINGO.TXT.

 TYPE ¯ Brings text files to the screen.  If long files scroll by so fast you
 can't read them, press the Pause key.  See MORE above.

 UNDELETE ¯ For undeleting files which you have accidently deleted.  Type
 UNDELETE d:\ p\, where D: is the drive and p\ is the path or directory.
 Follow the prompts.

 UNFORMAT ¯ Use when you have accidently formatted a floppy disk, and wish to
 recover the files.  Will not work if you have used FORMAT /q/u.

 VER ¯ Tells you what version of DOS you have installed.  Just type VER.

 XCOPY ¯ for copying a number of files.  Faster than COPY.  For instance, to
 copy from the WOW directory on C;\ drive, to an A: drive floppy, type XCOPY
 C:\WOW\*.* A:

 EFF Quote of the Month
 ----------------------

 "The net poses a fundamental threat not only to the authority of the
 government, but to all authority, because it permits people to organize,
 think, and influence one another without any institutional supervision
 whatsoever.  The government is responding to this threat with the Clipper
 Chip...The obvious danger in supplying people with encryption is that
 encryption makes it easier to keep secrets, which makes it easier for people
 to commit crimes.  With powerful encryption, the net would become an ideal
 place for criminals to organize conspiracies."

 - John Seabrook, "My First Flame", _New_Yorker_ 06/06/94

 If Windows 95 Operated Appliances Around Your House ...

 Written and Copyrighted by Sandy Illes

 Toaster:  Although the manual clearly states you can put up to 8 pieces of
 toast into the 2 slots, only 2 slices will actually become toasted.  The other
 slices will become wedged into the slots and when you call Micro$oft tech
 support, they'll tell you the problem isn't with the toaster, it's your wall
 outlet.

 Microwave oven:  Expect to eat lots of undercooked chicken and burnt bacon,
 since all settings are approximated to the standard of "average."  When you
 call Micro$oft tech support to complain about this, they'll offer to sell you
 the Micro$oft Cookbook for only $39.95.

 Telephone answering machine:  It doesn't matter what message you record, all
 callers will hear Bill Gates saying, "Windows 95 is the greatest... you are
 getting sleepy... sleeeeeepy... sleeeeeeeeepy... you will buy Windows 95, even
 if you don't have a computer..."

 Kettle:  In the old days, your kettle would whistle when it boiled.  Thanks to
 Micro$oft, your kettle will now whistle Dixie to a disco beat after a slight
 delay of 4-6 minutes to load the WAV file, during which your kettle will boil
 dry and you'll have to run out and buy a new one which will mean more
 corporate profit$ for Micro$oft.  The manual clearly states that all
 warranties are null and void once the box in which the kettle is packaged has
 been opened.

 TV:  Changing channels is as simple as switching your current channel into the
 background.  Unfortunately, since Windows 95 won't support all the cable
 channels now available, you're stuck with only 3 channels on UHF.  Windows 96
 promotional literature promises it will support up to 7 VHF channels, but only
 on TVs made after 1995.

 clothes out of the washer and into the dryer without proprietary software

 available from Micro$oft.

 When You Just Can't Wait:  A Guide to Shareware Heretic Level Design (Part I)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 "A not-so-quick, but still dirty, guide to shareware Heretic level design."

 Written by Paul Pollack, New Port Richey, Florida

 DISCLAIMER:  I cannot be held responsible for the prohibited distribution of
 levels for the Shareware version.  Please respect id's wishes and only use
 this while waiting for your registered version to arrive.  Do not distribute
 levels compatible with the Shareware version, as this is prohibited by id.

 If you've been within a ten mile radius of a computer within the past year,
 you know that a little thing called Doom's swept the country, with the
 innovative feature of allowing users to create their own levels.  And if you
 have Doom (or Doom ][) you may have noticed that hardly any of these levels
 work with the shareware version.  You can thank id for that; they specifically
 requested that programmers not create add-ons that work with the shareware
 versions of Doom or Heretic.

 Don't get me wrong here; if you play Doom a lot (and who doesn't?), there's no
 good excuse not to register it.  As a part-time programmer, I know from
 experience that even seemingly simple programs can get very involved.
 Creating something like Doom must have taken the id programmers an awful long
 time, and they live off your registration fees.  Both Doom and Heretic are
 awesome games, and well worth the pretty cheap price.

 Until now, one of the main arguments for registering Heretic was the fact that
 you'd be able to run all of those nifty little PWAD's floating around on
 BBSs.  But along came a tiny little program called DM2CONV, which coverts
 registered Doom PWAD's to work with the shareware version of Heretic.  As you
 might imagine, id probably isn't too happy about this, since one of the main
 reasons to register is gone.  But along with this conversion program comes the
 opportunity to create and convert your own levels that work with the shareware
 version.

 First of all, if you have the shareware version of Heretic, it's pretty hard
 to edit levels.  Using a program like HeeP will let you edit; it just won't
 let you save.  What about DCK, the Doom Construction Kit?  Well, that program
 drops you right back to DOS, as soon as it sees that you don't have the
 registered version.  Well then, it seems like we're at a dilemma.  So of
 course, you should register your copy, but what about the time in between,
 while waiting for your registered version to arrive.

 As a PWAD author, I know that many of you want to get started on your WAD
 files right away, so while you're waiting, you can be kicking some enemy butt
 (Disciples of D'Sparil, Gargoyles, Golems, Iron Liches, etc.) in your levels
 for the shareware version. (DO NOT DISTRIBUTE LEVELS FOR THE SHAREWARE VERSION
 OF HERETIC.)

 Nearly everyone has a copy of Doom/Doom ][; they've been selling like hot
 cakes ever since their release.  So it shouldn't come as so much of a shock to
 you that my work around involves the use of a Doom/Doom ][ editor, as well as
 a working copy of either of the programs.  Remember:  register!!!  Even though
 I'll offer a few work arounds, it can get to be a pain and should only be used
 until your registered version arrives.  Other use is completely unauthorized,
 and possibly illegal.  (You are going to register, right?)

         --- CREATING LEVELS FOR THE SHAREWARE VERSION OF HERETIC ---
 (id has not authorized the distribution of levels for the shareware Heretic)

 ONLY USE THIS PROGRAM WHILE WAITING FOR HERETIC, THE REGISTERED VERSION, TO
 ARRIVE.  OTHER USE IS PROHIBITED BY ID SOFTWARE.

 USER REQUIREMENTS:  Doom level design experience and a good knowledge of DOS

 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:  Either Doom/Doom ][ and an editor for the one you
 have, a shareware version of Heretic, and a copy of DM2CONV v1.6 beta,
 DM1TODM2 v1.0 +, DDT/DEU (for the trick described in Appendix C)

 SOFTWARE RECOMMENDATIONS:  Doom Construction Kit texture reference, DeuTex 3.1

 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:  A machine capable of running Doom/Doom ][ and Heretic

 First off, before I get into any actual procedure, let me give you just a
 brief outline of how it works; I'll get into more detail as I move on.
 Creating Heretic maps is almost identical to creating Doom maps, as the PWAD
 file formats for Doom, Doom ][, and Heretic are virtually identical.  If you
 have experience with Doom maps, you should have no problem with the basic
 mechanics of level design.

 What I'm going to do is to give you a list of many sector type numbers, object
 codes, and other such oddities for you to enter manually in your Doom editor.
 (Don't worry if your program doesn't recognize them; they work.)  The next
 part is a bit harder; if you have a copy of the original Doom, you don't need
 to worry about using non-Doom textures.  But those of us with Doom ][ have a
 severe limitation, since only Doom I textures can be converted.  That's why I
 recommended the Doom Construction Kit texture reference, as a handy-dandy tool
 to keep around to make sure you don't accidentally use any Doom ][ specific-
 feature.

 If you have the original Doom, it's pretty easy to create a Heretic level
 (using the " DM2CONV level.wad @HERETIC.RSP " command); just create an entire
 level and convert it from there.  But for those who want to create a
 completely new Heretic WAD (with all the great new Heretic features) and test
 it periodically would be well off using the method described below.  Another
 alternative is to simply edit the original DEU source code, or (even easier),
 edit the C source code (Turbo C++ v2.0 or higher required) code that comes
 with HEUHACK1.ZIP, so that the program lets you proceed even though you have
 the shareware version.  If you do make use of this possibility, please
 remember NOT to distribute editors that work with the shareware version, and
 only to do so (create levels, not distribute editors for the shareware
 version) if you're waiting for your registered version to arrive.

 What you basically do is to create the map as normal (using only DOOM I
 texture names; if your editor is for Doom ][ but lets you input DOOM I texture
 names (or Heretic texture names -- see Appendix A), by all means, do it!!!),
 including full texture selection.  But thing creation is completely different;
 for the shareware version of Heretic, here are the decimal codes for the
 enemies (select the option in your editor that looks like "Enter decimal
 code").

 Linedef types -- JUST KIDDING, DM2CONV converts them for you

 I recommend you print out the above as a reference list (much as I recommend
 to Doom ][ users to print out any texture reference list they can get their
 hands on, preferably "THE DOOM TEXTURE REFERENCE UTILITY" by Professor Doom
 AKA James Atchison"); it's an invaluable reference when working with your
 level.  That said, let's move on.  You should, by now, have your level pretty
 much completed, with items for the shareware version of Heretic (that probably
 doesn't mean much to your Doom/Doom ][ editor) and walls from id's awesome
 Doom.  Of course, this level need's a few changes before it can run correctly
 with Raven's Heretic.

 If you have Doom ][, you need a copy of DM1TODM2.  You'll also need a RIB
 conversion file, even though it'll be empty, for the most part.  The name of
 the RIB should be the same as the name of the PWAD (except for the extension,
 of course).  For example: If you're level's called MYWAD.WAD, your RIB should
 be MYWAD.RIB.  Here's what your finished RIB should look like (just copy this
 out, and replace level.wad with the name of your PWAD):

 #VERSION: DM1toDM2 v1.0á
 **************************************************************
 #INFO: level.WAD converted with DM1toDM2 on 03-01-1995
 **************************************************************

 #TEXTURES USED (Sorted on Doom I) - (Type, Doom II, Doom I)
 ===========================================================

 #PATCH CHANGES (Type, Doom II, Doom I)
 ======================================

 #COMMAND TO START (Type, DOS Command Line)
 ==========================================

 With that completed, you'll need to have your copy of DM2CONV on hand.  With
 your level, you'll want to convert the Doom wall textures to their nearest
 equivalent in Heretic.  To do this, type the following:

 DM2CONV level.wad /HERETIC /FLOOR /TEXTURE

 If you're an experienced DM2CONV user, you'll know that there's a response
 file you can use; don't use it!  Using the response file causes the program to
 convert the objects.  Since the objects are already in the correct format,
 converting them would completely screw up the level.  Trust me.  I know what
 I'm doing -- almost.  :-)

 Caution:  Your level.wad (replace it with your level's actual name) file will
 be overwritten.  After DM2CONV gets finished (a very fast process!) copy this
 file into your Heretic directory, use the -FILE command to run it.

 In case you don't know, that goes like this:
 HERETIC -FILE level.wad

 Where level.wad is the name of your PWAD file.  You may want to add commands
 that make Heretic skip to a certain level, run at a certain skill, etc.  These
 commands are detailed in Heretic's documentation, but just in case you don't
 have easy access to it, here's a quick rundown:

 HERETIC -FILE pwad.wad -SKILL x -WARP y z -RESPAWN -NOMONSTERS -DEVPARM

 In the above example, -FILE tells Heretic to run the specified PWAD, -SKILL
 tells Heretic to start on a certain skill level x, -WARP y z tells Heretic to
 start on episode y level z, -RESPAWN tells Heretic to make monsters come back
 a few seconds after they die, -NOMONSTERS tells Heretic to remove all monsters
 from the map, and -DEVPARM allows you to enter "Developers Mode," where you
 can get a screen shot by pressing F1.

 Yeah, and just a reminder:  ID has not authorized, in fact, rather the
 opposite, any distribution of levels compatible with the shareware versions
 of their games!  This is intended only for use while waiting for your
 registered version to arrive.  And then, once your registered version does
 arrive, you can port your levels over to an editor that works with the
 registered version of Heretic.  If you would like to work fully with Heretic
 levels (and use all the new things/textures), you need to register your
 version.

 PBM Flashback - June 1994
 -------------------------

 This month's PBM Flashback looks back to Saturday morning May 14, 1994, when
 the Inner Sanctum BBS featured a linkup with a couple of bulletin boards in
 Florida and several boards in Australia.  Rob Marlowe, Sysop of the New Port
 Richey based BBS (813) 848-6055, had been using an Internet connection to link
 up with the land down under.  While it was Saturday morning in Florida, it was
 Saturday night in Australia.  What follows is part of the written transcript
 recorded live, on-line, during this international linkup.  The BBS the person
 was on is shown after their name.

 Tom Koltai (Kakadu Konnection, Darwain, Australia ):  I thought IS was going
 to join us for our Saturday Morning chat

 Rob Marlowe (Inner Sanctum, New Port Richey, FL):  It IS our Saturday morning!
 <grin>

 Bruce Edwards (Kakadu Konnection):  hmmm, time for a beer...  brb

 Richard Ziegler (Inner Sanctum):  Could see the smoke from Challenger in '86
 from here.

 Lynne Wilding (1990 Multiline):  we've seen Skylab come down - heheheh

 Rob Marlowe (Inner Sanctum):  Yes, Ian.  You can see them go up from here even
 though KSC is on the other coast.  We get the sonic booms when they land too.

 Lynne Wilding (1990 Multiline):  so what is the topic of conversation in
 Florida this week?

 Carolyn Marlowe (Inner Sanctum):  Gay Culverhouse is resigning as President of
 the Tampa Bay Bucs!!

 Lynne Wilding (1990 Multiline):  Umm sort Carolyn, doesn't ring any bells with
 me

 Carolyn Marlowe (Inner Sanctum):  it wouldn't it's about our National Football
 League team :)

 Tom Koltai (KK):  Okay guys.... shutup... the footy is starting  FA CUP at
 wembley

 David Dean (1990 Multiline):  footy? yeah.  I'd like to see that!

 Shayne Harnsen (Common Ground, Adelaide, Australia):  what channel Tom ?!

 Tom Koltai (Kakadu Konnection):  U N I T E D..... body wave .... yeah yeah
 yeah.....  United

 Shayne Harmsen (CG):  <=- Man Ut'd supporter

 Carolyn Marlowe (Inner Sanctum):  we've never been good in footbol

 Shayne Harmsen (Common Ground):  Yanks can't play soccer!

 Richard Ziegler (Inner Sanctum):  Hey, we're gettin' better at
 Soccer/Football!

 Bruce Edwards (Kakadu Konnection):  yes Rich, at least you have the ball
 shapes correct

 Tom Koltai (Kakadu Konnection):  The national Anthem.... all stand

 Lynne Wilding (1990 Multiline):  Advance Austra............oh isn't anyone
 else singing?

 Tom Koltai (Kakadu Konnection):  God save the Queen... its an English footy
 match

 Andrew Pidgeon (Common Ground):  stick another shrimp on the barbie mate

 Lynne Wilding (1990 Multiline):  I live in a suburb south of Perth, Western
 Australia, Australia

 Tom Koltai (Kakadu Konnection):  Well Lynne, dont bother naming the
 suburb......  They cant even find Perth on their map yet

 Richard Ziegler (Inner Sanctum):  Perth, did they hold the America's Cup race
 there a few years back?

 Lynne Wilding (1990 Multiline):  yes they sure did Rich, Fremantle to be exact

 Richard Ziegler (Inner Sanctum):  Dennis Connor won back the Cup that year, I
 think.

 Lynne Wilding (1990 Multiline):  yes Rich, don't rub it in

 Jeff Powers (1990 Multiline):  he sure did oh well the Americas Cup is now
 fought out in courts of law :)

 Mike Copley (1990 Multiline):  whats this about florida?

 Lynne Wilding (1990 Multiline):  Florida is on Mike

 Jeff Powers (1990 Multiline):  Florida your kidding whoa I'm impressed :)

 Tom Koltai (Kakadu Konnection):  Chelsea -v- United, 1/2 time score... 0 0

 Editor's Note:  PBM Flashback will appear on a regular basis in future issues.
 Each issue will have this brief look back at some of the features which have
 appeared over the history of the Pasco BBS Magazine.

 Next Month
 ----------

 There are several things in the works for the July issue of the Pasco BBS
 Magazine.  There will be an article on whitehouse.gov, as we log into the
 White House's home page on the World Wide Web.  John Zagar has written a short
 article about the early days of the PC called "Remembering Computers."  There
 will be the second part of Paul Pollack's article on Heretic level design and
 Ed Garwood will have more Computer Basics.  Along with all our regular
 features, we will have all the latest news.

 The July issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine will be available on, or before, June
 22.  Make sure you do not miss a single issue of Tampa Bay's oldest free on-
 line magazine!
