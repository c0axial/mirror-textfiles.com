 Editor's Welcome
 ----------------

 Greetings fellow BBSer.  Thank you for taking the time to check out this
 month's Pasco BBS Magazine!

 The plan for this month was to have an interview with a major Shareware
 author, however, I never got around to arranging it.  So, that idea has been
 deferred to a future issue.  Some months there is more time to work on the
 magazine than others and this was one of those months when time seemed to run
 short.  The deadline always comes quickly.  This may be a good time to mention
 that I would be very happy to receive articles written from readers of the
 magazine.  Anything computer related would be great and the articles do not
 have to be lengthy.  Articles could help this editor avoid burnout, which is a
 common ailment for free on-line publications.  Enough of my traditional
 begging, there is plenty of interest in this month's issue.

 This month begins a series of updates for BBS Basics, the informational
 database for the new BBS user.  Over the next few issues we will have new and
 updated articles, as we prepare to release the next version of the Freeware
 program.  This month looks at High Speed Transfers, Line Noise, Etc.  There is
 also the second in a series of great articles written by Ed Garwood called
 Computer Basics.  Paul Pollack has written a very nice review of the
 commercial sequel to the Shareware classic Doom, id Software's Doom II:  Hell
 on Earth.  PBM Flashback looks at what some people saying before the 1993
 release of Doom.  This month's news includes a short article about a new Pasco
 County BBS listing and a couple of interesting press releases.  Along with all
 our regular features is a list of the e-mail addresses for most members of the
 United States Senate.

 Until next month, thanks for reading!

 New Pasco BBS Listing Released
 ------------------------------

 Clark Gilbo is well known to Pasco County BBS users for his efforts compiling
 BBS listings over the years.  On April 5, 1996, he released his latest
 endeavor, the Pasco BBS Listing.  This new publication contains telephone
 numbers for computer bulletin boards in western Pasco County and Pinellas
 County based systems located north of Largo.  The Pasco BBS Listing, which is
 scheduled to be released on a monthly basis, has a standard ASCII edition and
 an ANSI color edition.

 Clark Gilbo first published a BBS list in the fall of 1992, when he created
 the Westcoast 813 BBS Directory.  At that time, the 813 area code stretched
 along a good portion of Florida's west coast.  Late in 1994, when the local
 area codes were changed, he renamed the list to the 813 BBS Directory.  This
 version covered Pasco, Pinellas and Hillsborough counties, which were the
 counties retaining the 813 area code.  The last release of the 813 BBS
 Directory was in the fall of 1995.  Clark Gilbo put it this way in the first
 release of the new Pasco listing.  "Due to non-support of BBS users and system
 operators of the 813 calling area, The 813 BBS Directory is history!  The
 editor of this listing still hold all rights to The 813 BBS Directory.  Also,
 the phone bill has been on the average of $45 per month, which hasn't even
 come close to breaking even.  I can no longer can afford it.  So that west
 Pasco County has a good listing, I'm doing this listing.  Nothing too fancy.
 Hope you find what you're looking for."

 Despite the similarity of names, the Pasco BBS Listing is not created by the
 Pasco BBS Magazine.  The Board of Trade BBS (813) 862-4772 will continue to
 act as a primary point of distribution for the listing, and the latest issue
 will always be a free download in the Local Author Support file directory.
 Home Office Online of Tarpon Springs, when the system comes on-line, will act
 as the home of the listing.

 Doom II:  Hell on Earth Review

 Although millions of users will have bought Doom II by the time most of you
 read this, I feel it only appropriate to look at one of the hottest selling
 titles.  Doom II is the best first person shooter there ever was, surpassing
 the original Doom in many areas, and setting the standard for the future of
 electronic entertainment.  Just read on and find out what I mean.

 The Explanation:

 Graphics (A+):  It's back, and better than ever.  With Doom II, ID has set a
 new standard for graphic detail in a game of this kind.  The walls, doors, and
 monsters all look great throughout, and don't break up into a pixelated mess
 when you get up close.  There's a variety of styles present in the levels, and
 the new monsters (all seven of 'em) all look great.  After playing Doom II,
 you'll wonder how you ever got along with those other inferior titles.

 Sound (B):  The sounds in Doom II were great, and all the weapons sounded like
 they were supposed to.  This is one of the aspects of Doom that is basically
 the same as the original, except that the new creatures make some cool new
 sounds.  Then again, who really cares about such trivial matters as sound and
 music when the game is so much fun?

 Music (B):  Like the original Doom, the music was fairly solid throughout,
 although I wouldn't go so far as to say they'd win a music award.  There are
 some great new tunes, though, and most Doomers won't be disappointed by the
 selections.

 Plot (N/A):  Although Doom II actually has a plot, it doesn't really matter.
 All you really have to know is that the monsters are your enemies and you have
 some rather big guns.  For the people that enjoy hearing about the plot, here
 it is:  You've just come back from your mission to the moonbase, and after
 arriving on Earth you begin to notice some strangely familiar sights.  Humans
 are turning into monsters, and all hell is basically breaking out all over
 Earth (hence the title).  As usual, you're left to save everyone's butt.

 Animation (A+):  Although you'll need at least a 486 SX-25 to really enjoy the
 game, a DX-33 with VLB and a full hard drive installation will really get
 things moving in a full-screen window.  With a fast VLB/PCI machine, the
 animation is as smooth as any game you've seen before, and probably even more
 ultra-realistic.  All the characters and guns have realistic movements,
 especially if played off your hard-disk, and help bring life to the game.

 Puzzles (N/A):  Although there are puzzles in the game, and actually quite a
 bit of them (find the keycard, then the door, etc.), they blend in so well
 with the actual gameplay that it was impossible to give this a separate
 rating.  If you want to know about the difficulty, well then, here goes:  Doom
 II is a whole lot harder than the original Doom, with larger levels (all
 thirty-two of 'em), tougher enemies, and more screamin' demons who want
 nothing more in the world than to see you dead.  As you progress through the
 game, the levels get more and more difficult, with pits that you can't get out
 of if you fall in, crushing ceilings that hurt you unless you have God mode
 on, and many more enemies.

 Humor (N/A):  If you've played Doom, you'll realize why this got an N/A.  Doom
 wasn't meant to be a funny game, but rather an explosive action game that
 would send the millions to their local computer dealer to buy a new PC.  When
 the action's this exciting, and the game's this fun, you'd think that ID
 wouldn't even bother with humor.  Wrong...  One of the least reported facts
 are the two extra levels in Doom II, called Wolfenstein and Grosse.  The
 first, Wolfenstein, is just what it sounds like, a level from Wolfenstein
 where you go up against some pretty mean blue soldiers (although they seem a
 little small).  Although I doubt that ID intended this level to be funny, it
 kinda is.  ID's probably never going to remake Wolfenstein with the Doom
 engine, but it gives you a pretty good idea of how it would look if they did.
 The latter, Grosse, is pretty self explanatory.  It starts off like the
 previous level, except towards the end you walk into a room and see tiny
 little Commander Keens hanging.  To beat the level, you have to blow up the
 Commander Keens (and get to see their heads roll on the floor).  Man, I didn't
 know ID was so mad at their Apogee association.  It still got an N/A though;
 these weren't really that humorous, and I'm not even sure if ID intended them
 to be.

 Funfactor (A+):  Ask Alex, and he'll tell you that I was never a Doom maniac
 -- sure I had my days of Doom euphoria, but those days grew numbered and I
 never really bothered with the game that much after that.  It seemed like a
 lot of repetition -- grab the gun, kill the monster, grab the gun again, etc.
 But Doom II hurls so many ferocious monsters and so many different levels at
 you that you just can't help but love it.  Modem and network play don't hurt
 it either.

 Re-play factor (A+):  After playing through the thirty base levels and
 conquering the two hidden levels, I doubt that many gamers will go through the
 entire game again.  Sure, the hardcore Doom fans might do it --OK, so maybe I
 was wrong -- but I for one, wouldn't.  But the addition of modem and network
 play only add to the replay value, and lend the game a unique human touch that
 just adds the final glaze to the already realistic presentation.  But the
 final touch, and the reason for the A+ is that there are a seemingly infinite
 number of Doom WAD's floating around on on-line services today, and it isn't
 that hard to find a program that converts Doom I wads to Doom II WAD's.  With
 all those levels floating around out there (including Gladiator, my own Doom
 ][ level available on the Board of Trade BBS and Studio PC), and the
 previously mentioned modem/network play, Doom II has the most replay value
 I've ever seen in a game of its kind.

 Control/Manipulation (A):  If you played Doom (hey, who didn't?!), control
 will be a snap for you to master -- especially since Doom can be controlled
 with a wide variety of peripherals.  Doom makes full use of a keyboard, mouse,
 or joystick, and with a gamepad the controls really shine.  Like the original
 Doom, Doom II also supports the Cyberman.  No matter which controller you
 choose, Doom II responds quickly and accurately.

 Technical factor (A):  What can I say:  I didn't have a single technical
 problem in Doom.  OK, so that's not entirely true -- I did get an error when I
 tried to warp to level 33, but that was my fault, since there isn't a level
 33, not the game's.  With the hardware described above, you should be able to
 run the game in a good sized window and still maintain a fairly high frames-
 per-second rate.  Although Hell on Earth will perform the best if run from a
 hard disk, you may be forced to run it from the CD.  If you opt not to install
 it, the CD version actually runs okay.  There were some lost frames when you
 walk around, and occasionally you lost control over your character when it was
 accessing the CD, but for the most part it was tolerable.  The only major
 downfall to running it from the CD is the inability to save any games.

 Concept (B):  I admit it, the number of 3D games seems to increase
 exponentially, and the concept has become overused.  Every time a new first-
 person shooter comes out, I, as a reviewer, have to ask myself whether it's
 fresh and original enough to stand out in an already overcrowded field.  With
 Doom II, the answer is a definite maybe.  While there are many improvements
 from the original, including seven new monsters (like the lost-soul throwing
 pain elemental, and the Baron's little brother -- the Hell Knight), one new
 weapon (the double barreled sawed-off shotgun), enhanced graphic effects, and
 a few speed enhancements, its still just Doom.  Then again, being "just Doom"
 isn't half bad...

 Bang for your Buck (A+):  If you're a Doom fan, there's no excuse not to get
 this game.  With its new additions, cutting-edge feel, and devilishly fun
 gameplay, Doom II is destined to be one of the most popular games of the year.
 The graphics, sound effects, and level layout all contribute to a marvelous
 whole, and Doom II:  Hell on Earth deserves to become the standard for all new
 arcade titles.  At $40 for thirty levels (not to mention the two secret
 levels), its a real steal.

 Ending (D):  While Doom II is more fun than the original, and features better
 graphics and sound, it's just plain more difficult then the original.  There
 are tons of enemies, crushing ceilings, and many more devilishly difficult
 features that make Doom II a lot harder than many arcade games on the market;
 but while this may seem to be too difficult, multiple difficulty settings
 (yep, the old "I'm too young to die, etc." settings) let you tailor the
 difficulty to your needs.  And, if you have to, you can use the codes as a
 last resort.  The ending of Doom II was a let-down, to say the least.  Those
 hoping for a 256-color animated sequence or something equally impressive will
 no doubt be disappointed.  Instead of one of these, you're treated with a
 background and text, similar to the end of the shareware Doom; the only
 redeeming quality is that after that screen ends, it brings up a screen with a
 monster moving in a stationary place.  Press a key, and the monster dies, and
 the next monster comes up. It's pretty neat to watch, but still nothing
 spectacular.

 Overall (A):  When I first saw Doom II, I never though that I would learn to
 like it as much as I did.  The scenery in the game is gorgeous, due to the
 excellent 256-color graphics, the sound is great, and the gameplay is the
 most exciting I've ever seen in a game of this type.  Add modem/network play,
 and you have an incredible mix that other game designers would be wise to
 imitate.

 PBM Flashback - May 1993
 ------------------------

 The May 1993 issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine featured an article titled
 "Shareware Games...A Look Ahead," which looked at some programs due out that
 summer.  One of the games was Doom:  Evil Unleashed published by id Software.
 With this month's issue carrying a review of the commercial sequel, Doom II:
 Hell on Earth, what better time to reflect on what people were saying about
 Doom prior to its release three years ago.  The article included comments from
 Jay Wilbur, Chief Operating Officer at Id Software, and Dan Linton, Sysop of
 Software Creations BBS.

 Dan Linton says "it makes Wolfenstein look like a High School project."  Jay
 Wilbur says it is a little like "Wolfenstein on steroids."  What are they
 talking about?  Id Software's release of the 3D action game Doom.  When asked
 to describe, the game Jay Wilbur states "I just don't know where to begin.
 You play an off duty Space Marine who is guarding an off planet research
 facility.  When an experiment goes array, and the very fabric of time and
 space is ripped, demons, or the bad guys are coming in from the other side.
 In Episode One, which will be the Shareware release episode, your job is to
 stop them from coming in.  Later episodes will actually take you to the other
 side.  It shares the first person perspective as Wolfenstein, but that is
 where it stops.  It is just going to be far more complex.  Network play, four
 people via a local area network, two people via a serial link or modem link,
 or solo play.  It will have tons of traps.  Tons more weapons.  A true light
 shading.  Multiple level floors and ceilings, where in Wolfenstein you had
 only set level, in this you could have cathedral like ceilings and dips in the
 floor and stairways.  It runs, I'm going to guess and say, fifty percent
 faster than Wolfenstein, depending of course on your system."

 Editor's Note:  PBM Flashback will appear on a regular basis in future issues.
 Each issue will have this brief look back at some of the features which have
 appeared over the history of the Pasco BBS Magazine.

 MMTrek Screen Saver Review
 --------------------------

 The MMTrek Screen Saver, written by German author Heiko Tietz, is a screen
 saver for Windows based on the popular television show Star Trek.  Every
 fifteen seconds the program displays one of four different animated pictures
 from the show.  MMTrek is easy to install and, even if it seems to run a bit
 slow, it is not a bad effort for a program being released as "postcardware."

 The images displayed include two versions of the starship Enterprise, a Star
 Trek insignia and another starship resembling a Bird of Prey.  The program can
 be configured to play a .WAV file at different points during its operation,
 including during the fly-by of a starship.  There is also the option of
 setting the "speedfactor" for the animations and the author may add additional
 features if there is a "significant response."  The program will run under
 virtually any Windows setup and requires the readily available VBRUN200.DLL,
 which is not included in the download package.

 While there are no charges for the use of MMTrek, it is not being released as
 Freeware.  It is being released as "postcardware", which is sometimes simply
 called "cardware."  To continue using the program, after the thirty day
 evaluation period, you must send a postcard to the author.

 Written by Ed Garwood, Hudson, FL

 DID YOU KNOW....?

 You can have your screen display double width letter?  At your C:\ prompt,
 just type Mode 40 and your screen will instantly change.  To go back to the
 normal display, just type Mode 80.

 DID YOU KNOW....?

 Tired of that black screen with white letters?  Like to change it?  How about
 bright green letters on a blue background?  Sound good?

 First, check your CONFIG.SYS file to see if it has the ANSI.SYS device listed.
 If not, enter the following line at the end of your CONFIG.SYS file:

                        DEVICE=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS /X

 and save your new CONFIG.SYS file.  Now, type (EXACTLY) the following at your
 C:\ prompt :

                  Prompt $E[1;44;32m $P Today is $D $P

 Then press <ENTER> and then type CLS.  See if you don't like the display .  If
 you don't, then type the following:

                                  Prompt $P$G

 Press <ENTER>  and you're back where you started from>

 DID YOU KNOW......?

 You can type fractions (or lines, or foreign language letters, etc) without
 changing your keyboard?  Want to type the fraction «?  First, make sure that
 your NUM LOCK is on (is the light on?).  Then, just hold down the <ALT> key
 while you press the numbers 1 7 1 on the numbers keyboard (to your right).
 <ALT> 2 0 6 gives you Î.  If you like Greek, <ALT> 2 2 8 will give you ä.
 <ALT> 1 2 9 gives you the German letter .  The above are standard ASCII
 control figures.  You'll find them in any reference manual, including your
 printer manual.

 DID YOU KNOW.....?  THESE WINDOWS TIPS AND TRICKS

 (Re-printed from Morgantown, WV's IBM PCUG-PC Expressions Newsletter)

 To quickly print a file in Windows 3.1, use the new 'drag and drop' technique.
 Once you have Print Manager minimized, simply drag the file icon and drop it
 onto the Print Manager Icon.  This technique is usually faster than opening
 the application, opening the file to be printed, and then choosing the
 application's print command to print the file

 To quickly open a file, drag the file icon and drop it onto the title bar of
 the open application or onto the minimized application icon.  The Windows
 operating system automatically loads the file.

 For a quick switch between open application in Windows, press ALT-TAB.  To
 display the icon and name for any open application, repeatedly press the TAB
 key while holding the ALT key down.  To open the displayed application,
 release the  ALT key.

 To open a  dialog box, listing all the open applications on your system, hold
 down the CTRL key and press ESC.  The Task List is handy for closing or
 switching applications.

 To format a floppy disk faster, use the new Windows File Manager 'Quick
 Format' option.  Select FORMAT from the Disk menu in File Manager.  The option
 is listed in the dialog box.  NOTE:  This works ONLY for disks that have been
 previously formatted.

 Want the same application to open each time you start Windows?  Hold down the
 CTRL key while you drag the application icon and drop it on the Startup group
 icon  or open group window.  When you restart Windows, those programs whose
 icons are displayed in the Startup Group will be launched.

 To select TruType fonts for your documents, simply look for the TruType icon
 next to the font names listed in your application's font menu.  There are
 several families of TruType fonts, including Arial, Courier New, and New Times
 Roman.  To customize the fonts used to display information in a File Manager
 Window, select FONT from the Option Menu.  This opens a dialog box that lists
 your font display options.

 To choose from a variety of DESKTOP color schemes, open the Control Panel in
 the MAIN group, and choose the Color icon.  A dialog box list the color
 schemes (or choose your own!).

 new service has a heavy emphasis on home use and has intense graphics, news,
 sports, weather, business and entertainment information, e-mail, shopping,
 chat and full Internet access.  The software to access the new service
 requires Windows 95 and a CD-ROM drive, with a Macintosh version due out in
 the future.  Unlimited access to Wow! is $17.95 per month.

 The General Accounting Office estimates automating the way the Federal
 Government processes travel expenses could save taxpayers $1 billion annually.
 Some agencies use as many as 39 paper forms.

 Apple Computer Inc. announced a $700 million loss for the first quarter of
 1996.  This comes after a $69 million loss for the last quarter of 1995.
 Writing off unsold products and paying for job cuts created the larger than
 expected loss.  In related news, March 31 was the last day for Apple's eWorld
 on-line service.

 The Internal Revenue Service decided not to provide on-line tax return filing,
 known as Cyberfile, for 1995 taxes.  A new system was going to allow taxpayers
 to file returns directly with the IRS on the World Wide Web in selected areas
 this Spring.  However, security concerns and technical problems made it
 impossible to offer the service for this tax season.

 The Smithsonian Institution, which is celebrating its 150th anniversary, is
 planning to expand the information available on their home page on the World
 Wide Web (http://www.si.edu).  Within the next couple of years, they hope to
 make over 100,000 items viewable on the Internet.  While the institution's
 Washington DC based museum can only display about one-seventh of its
 collection at any one time, it is possible that some day everything could be
 exhibited on-line.  At the present time, the Web site explains current
 displays, shows pictures hanging in the museums and describes upcoming events.

 Rumors are circulating that MicroSoft, Inc. is planning to release an updated
 version of the Windows operating system during 1996.  Before Windows 95 was
 released it was known as "Chicago."  Windows 96 is rumored to be nicknamed
 "Nashville."

 "WEB.X -- The Internet Event for Business" is shaping up as one of the major
 on-line related events for 1996.  The show, which is being held concurrently
 with the PC Expo, will take place June 18-20 at the Jacob Javits Convention
 Center in New York City and September 24-26 at McCormick Place in Chicago.

 BBS Basics:  High Speed Transfers, Line Noise, Etc.
 ---------------------------------------------------

 What follows is not intended to be a technical discussion on high speed
 modems, but tries to answer some commonly asked questions.  The new user, and
 the expert alike, may ask why file transfers are slow at 14,400 baud and
 above.

 Line noise over common telephone wires has been a problem since the first
 modems made their connection.  For years it was said that 2400 bps was as fast
 as normal telephone lines could transmit data and that we would never see
 faster speeds due to the low band-width and high noise levels.  Modem
 technology has advanced over the years, but line noise is not a thing of the
 past.  Unfortunately, it is still with us.  These new modems are not magic
 either.  They manage to hide the line noise, and some are able to filter it
 out, but it is still there.

 If line noise occurs during the connection process, where your modem and the
 host modem perform their hand-shaking sequence looking for common ground, then
 it is very likely that the two modems will agree to a slower speed to avoid
 having problems during the remainder of the call.  In fact, if line noise
 occurs during the call the modems may decide to shift down at that time as
 well.  When line noise occurs during a file transfer between two modems which
 have established an error correction session, the only evidence of this line
 noise may very well be slow file transfers and nothing else.  Many modems give
 no other indications this extra work is being required, and may eventually
 give up and just drop the carrier completely.

 If you find that downloading ASCII files produces excellent file transfers
 rates, but downloading Zip files reduces the rate, then very likely you have
 turned on an option known as "data compression."  It is like trying to use
 PKZip to zip a Zip file.  In its attempt to shrink the file, it actually
 causes the file to expand in size and this slows down the file transfer.

 For high speed file transfers to work you generally want to use some type of
 flow control.  If your modem or software is not set up correctly, it is
 possible that flow control problems will result in errors.  When data is lost
 due to flow control problems there is only one solution and that is to send
 the data again.  This results in slowing down your file transfer.

 Choosing the right file transfer protocol is important and Xmoden is not
 always appropriate at high speeds.  Zmodem has the ability to re-send the last
 block of data while other protocols, such as Ymodem/G, have no way to request
 that data be resent, so the transfer is aborted.  Ymodem/G is one of the
 fastest, but Zmodem is more dependable.

 And if all that is not enough, it seems like certain times of the year
 introduce more line noise on the phone lines than others.  Some causes of line
 noise are wet ground conditions, which introduces electrical changes in the
 phone company's lines.  Increased traffic on the telephone lines leads to
 increased noise.  Some of the worst conditions can occur on local calls, as
 local circuits seldom receive the maintenance attention given to long distance
 circuits.

 There are a few hardware options which can reduce the errors in high speed
 transfers.  The easiest is to make sure that all your connections are clean.
 Dirty or corroded connections will obviously have a negative impact on your
 results.  Another is to make sure that your phone line is grounded.  This not
 only helps reduce line noise, but may save your equipment in the event the
 phone lines becomes electrically charged.  For example, it is possible for a
 lightning strike to come through the phone line.  Some surge protectors have a
 built-in port to plug the phone line into and most electronics stores have a
 device, which plugs into an electrical outlet, to ground the phone line.  If
 your computer is a few years old, you may have to install a new serial card
 with a 16550A UART chip.  This high speed communications port is a requirement
 for 28,800 baud file transfers.  Most of the newer computers have these high
 speed UART chips installed.

 So what else can you do about line noise?  You can contact your local phone
 company.  Sometimes the phone company does find a correctable problem.  Using
 high quality software and equipment can hide some of the problems.  Or you
 could move to France where fiber optic telecommunications is a reality.

 Cleveland BBS Lawsuit, In Response to the Raids
 -----------------------------------------------

 Father & Son Computer Users Fight Back:  Cincinnati Electronic Bulletin Board
 System Users File Class Action Lawsuit Against Simon Leis & Computer Task
 Force (Press Release of 3/6/96)

 A father and son filed a class action lawsuit today in federal court against
 Sheriff Simon L. Leis, Jr., and other law enforcement officials.  On August
 31, 1995, members of the Hamilton County Regional Electronic Computer
 Intelligence Task Force (RECI) raided the West Chester home of Michael O'Brien
 and seized his personal computer system.  O'Brien's son Noah, a 15 year old
 sophomore at Indian Hill High School, ran a computer bulletin board system
 called "Spanish Inquisition" from his father's computer.

 The police raid took everything on the O'Briens' computer and its bulletin
 board system, including all the private electronic mail and work product of
 the users.  This is the second user class action challenging a government
 seizure of computer material.  Both actions have arisen out of the activities
 of Sheriff Leis and the RECI Task Force.  According to the search warrant used
 to justify the raid, the Task Force was seeking computer image files and
 "hacker" information on a system that contained thousands of public and
 private messages.

 Noah & his father, an engineering manager, represent a class of hundreds of
 users of the Spanish Inquisition electronic bulletin board.  Mr. O'Brien uses
 the computer system to send and receive electronic mail and to do work
 projects at home; his son ran the bulletin board system, sent & received
 e-mail, and authored computer programs and artwork.

 The lawsuit claims that the wholesale seizure of the computer bulletin board
 system violated the users' constitutional right to free speech and
 association, and that the seizure of their private e-mail, public messages,
 and materials intended for publication violated their right to privacy and
 federal law.

 "The Task Force used a drift net to troll for a tiny amount of supposed
 'cyberporn' and 'hacker' tools," said Cincinnati civil rights lawyer Scott T.
 Greenwood, who represents the plaintiffs.  "In the process, they netted an
 enormous amount of entirely irrelevant material, and shut down a
 constitutionally-protected forum for speech and association."

 Greenwood added, "This seizure was doubly outrageous.  It came on the heels of
 the first suit filed against the very same defendants for the same type of
 constitutional violations.  Whether the sheriff and our local 'Internet
 police' like it or not, the Bill of Rights is not optional just because they
 don't like it or understand it.  Shutting down a computer system and seizing
 people's private communications turns the First Amendment on its head."

 The lawsuit claims that Sheriff Leis and the Task Force violated the First
 Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, several provisions of the federal Electronic
 Communications Privacy Act of 1986, the First Amendment Privacy Protection Act
 of 1980, and Ohio common law privacy rights, and seeks actual damages,
 statutory damages, and punitive damages on behalf of the lead plaintiffs and
 the entire class.

 Copies of the complaint are currently available by e-mail, and will also be
 available later on a website.  The first user class action's website may be
 found at http://www.iac.net/ccc.

 Online Parental Control Act
 ---------------------------

 Eshoo Introduces Online Parental Control Act - Legislation Strengthens
 Parental Control Of Online Materials, Eliminates "Indecency" Standard (Press
 Release of March 14, 1996)

 Washington, D.C. -- Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) today introduced the Online
 Parental Control Act of 1996 (OPCA) to strengthen the control parents have
 over their children's access to online materials, eliminate the "indecency"
 standard from the Communications Act of 1934, and provide additional defenses
 against liability for publishing online materials.  Representatives Pelosi (D-
 CA), Dellums (D-CA), Farr (D-CA), Gejdenson (D-CT), and Woolsey (D-CA) are
 original cosponsors of OPCA.

 When the Telecommunications Reform Bill was signed into law earlier this year,
 it made sweeping changes to America's telecommunications policy.  Among those
 changes was the establishment of a ban on using telecommunications devices to
 provide "indecent" materials to minors, as well as defenses against being held
 liable for a violation of that ban.  For example, people could avoid liability
 by using software that blocks the access of minors to such materials or
 restricts access through the use of credit card numbers or adult access codes.
 Some U.S. Representatives, including Rep. Eshoo, opposed the "indecency"
 standard because the range of material it would ban was so broad that it
 violates the right to freedom of speech.

 The "indecency" standard is currently being challenged in court by a large
 coalition of free speech advocacy groups and high technology companies.

 "The Online Parental Control Act will encourage an open dialogue in Congress
 about the best way to both give parents control over what their children see
 online and protect the First Amendment rights of Internet users," said Rep.
 Eshoo.  "My proposal builds on last year's efforts to reach a compromise on
 this issue by offering more incentives for the online community to provide
 families with better parental control technologies.

 "I'm supportive of efforts to address this issue in the courts, but I believe
 Congress also needs to offer a legislative solution.  Given the political
 realities of the current Congress, I think OPCA offers the most realistic way
 to settle this dispute in a timely and effective manner."

 The Online Parental Control Act of 1996:

 Replaces the "indecency" standard with a "harmful to minors" standard;
 Establishes a definition for "harmful to minors;" Maintains the Communications
 Act of 1934's legal defenses against liability for people who choose to give
 parents technology that:  1) blocks or restricts access to online materials
 deemed obscene or harmful to minors, and 2) restricts access to such materials
 through adult access codes or credit card numbers; Adds two new defenses:  1)
 the use of labeling or segregating systems to restrict access to online
 materials, such as systems developed using the standards designed by the
 Platform for Internet Content Selection project (PICS), and 2) the use of
 other systems that serve the same function of the other defenses if they are
 as reasonable, effective, and appropriate as blocking, adult access code, and
 labeling technologies; and Protects providers or users of interactive computer
 services, information content providers, and access software providers from
 civil or criminal liability under state law for making available to minors
 materials that are indecent or harmful to minors if they take actions to
 qualify for the defenses mentioned above.

 "I'd rather have Mom and Dad monitoring their children's online viewing habits
 than the government," concluded Rep. Eshoo.  "Technology offers the best
 opportunity for parents to manage what their kids have access to, and the
 Online Parental Control Act encourages those technologies to be developed more
 fully."

 The "indecency" standard is a vague term that has been subject to legal
 challenge by a wide range of free speech advocates and high technology
 companies.  The broad nature of the "indecency" standard means that it could
 lead to a prohibition on material such as classic art like Michelangelo's
 David, classic literature like "Catcher In The Rye," and frank discussions
 about birth control, sexuality, or disease transmission.  "Harmful to minors,"
 on the other hand, already works successfully in 48 states, more directly
 addresses speech that actually harms children, and passes constitutional
 muster.

 PICS is a cross-industry working group assembled under the auspices of MIT's
 World Wide Web Consortium to develop an easy-to-use content labeling and
 selection platform that empowers people worldwide to selectively control
 online content they receive through personal computers.  The Recreational
 Software Advisory Council recently announced that it will soon implement a
 detailed voluntary ratings system, using PICS standards, that will let
 computer users filter out varying degrees of sex, violence, nudity, and foul
 language.  Companies and groups supporting PICS include Apple, America Online,
 AT&T, the Center for Democracy and Technology, CompuServe, IBM, France
 Telecom, Prodigy, Providence Systems/Parental Guidance, Surf Watch Software,
 and Time Warner Pathfinder.

 Next Month
 ----------

 Since June 1 is the beginning of the 1996 Hurricane Season, the June issue of
 the Pasco BBS Magazine will take a look at some of the hurricane tracking
 programs available in the on-line world.  Here in Florida, we are certainly
 hoping that the predictions for a less active season are accurate.  There will
 also be an article on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's home page on
 the World Wide Web.  The updating of BBS Basics will continue with "What is a
 BBS," which will include a brief history of the computerized bulletin board.
 Game guru Paul Pollack will have part one of a two part article on designing
 your own levels for id Software's popular game of Heretic.  All the latest
 news, and the rest of our regular features, will be included as well.

 The June issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine will be available on, or before, May
 22.  Make sure you do not miss a single issue of Tampa Bay's oldest free on-
 line magazine!
