 Editor's Welcome
 ----------------

 I really did not notice it until I started putting it together, but this is
 one of the largest issues yet of the Pasco BBS Magazine.  PBM just keeps on
 cranking!

 This month's feature article came out of the recent release of a great
 baccarat program for the PC.  This very mis-understood casino game does not
 get very much exposure, so why not give it some here?  This month continues
 our comprehensive coverage of ONE BBSCON '95 and there are updates on the
 Dvorak Awards and the lack of a BBS contest for this year's convention.  There
 is also information on the PCBoard Communications Retreat scheduled to take
 place in Utah this September.  One article is the press release announcing the
 formation of the Electronic Frontier Foundation five years ago.  The EFF has
 done much to protect our on-line freedoms and I hope you enjoy looking back to
 the basic concepts that got the ball rolling.

 I want to thank Matt Murrell for sending in what will be the first in a series
 of Shareware reviews.  This month also features an article on CD-ROMs by Alex
 Thomas, and I want to thank him as well.  Look for all of our regular features
 including PBM Flashback, which will take a look back at the days of "The Best
 of CyberScape LIVE!"

 I am really excited about next month's Special ONE BBSCON '95 Commemorative
 Issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine.  For now, I'll get started on that, while you
 (hopefully) enjoy this month's issue.

 Baccarat, The Most Mis-Understood of Casino Games, Comes to the PC
 ------------------------------------------------------------------

 If you have been to Las Vegas you have no doubt walked by the baccarat tables
 and, perhaps, taken one look at the layout on the table and thought to
 yourself that it looked pretty complicated.  That mystique is reenforced by
 the casinos having the baccarat tables in a secluded roped off section of the
 casino with tuxedo clad coupdeaires handling the action.  The reality is that
 baccarat is the easiest of the casino table games to learn.

 It is generally accepted that the card game of baccarat dates back to 15th
 Century France, but some will argue that it is just a spin-off of blackjack
 dating back to the mid 1800's.  It is thought that the game began during the
 reign of Charles VIII who was king of France from 1483 until his death in
 1498.  Charles VIII was a typical tyrant King who imprisoned his eventual
 successor, Louis XII, for rebellious behavior.  "Charles the Affable" invaded
 Italy in 1494, occupied Naples in 1495, and was part of the Valois Dynasty
 which reigned during The Hundred Years' War.  Considering the times, maybe a
 diversion like baccarat was needed.

 To this day, Baccarat remains the principal gambling card game of France and
 several other European countries, but the French also play a variation of the
 game called Baccara-en-Banque.  Baccarat is known as Punto Banco in England
 and some other counties.  In recent years, the original game of baccarat has
 been all but replaced by a speeded-up version, baccarat chemin-de-fer, usually
 called just chemin-de-fer.  The game played in American casinos actually came
 from Cuban casinos in the early 1950's.

 Just like the popular card games of blackjack and twenty-one, the differences
 between baccarat and chemin-de-fer are relatively minor.  In twenty-one the
 house always controls the deal of the cards and the bank, but in blackjack the
 dealing duties and the responsibility for covering the bets are passed when a
 player is dealt a two card natural twenty-one.  In chemin-de-fer every player
 has a chance to be the banker and may take over the bank by saying "Banco."
 In chemin-de-fer the gamble is limited by the amount the bank is willing to
 lose and the banker is never liable for the payment in excess of his bank.  In
 the casino version of baccarat, the banker does not lose the bank when he
 loses a coup.  The casino remains the banker, so there is technically no limit
 and players can play against the casino's entire bankroll.

 Chemin-de-fer can typically have ten or more players and almost any number can
 play.  Each player is dealt an individual hand, but in the casino version of
 baccarat, only two hands are dealt, Player and Banker.  The shoe does pass
 from player to player in the casino variation but, as noted early, the casino
 assumes the permanent responsibility for the bank.  In the less formal game of
 chemin-de-fer the banker plays the Bank's hand and the players play their own
 hands, but in the casino game the player can select the Bank or Player bet and
 switch back and forth from bet to bet.  Another difference in chemin-de-fer is
 if a player has a total of five he must decide to ask for a third card, but in
 the casinos the player must draw a card.

 For all its mystique, baccarat remains a game anyone can play.  There are only
 two decisions that have to be made:  1) How much to bet, 2) Which side to bet
 on.  Typically eight decks of cards are shuffled together and dealt from a box
 called a shoe.  In front of each player at the table there is a location where
 they place their bets.  A player can bet on either the Banker, Player or bet
 on a tie.  After the bets are placed, the dealer will deal out two hands.  One
 is called the Player's hand, the other is called the Banker's hand.  We will
 discuss the rules of baccarat, but you do not have any decisions to make.

 Four cards are dealt face up on the table, two cards for the Player's hand and
 two for the Banker's hand.  The cards retain their face value with aces having
 a value of one and 10's, and face cards, having a value of 0.  If the cards
 total over ten, the first digit is dropped and only the last digit is used for
 game play.  The object is to get a card count of 9, or as close to 9 as
 possible.  If either the Player or the Banker has a total of 8 or 9 on those
 first two cards, the hand is over.  An 8 or 9 on the initial deal is called a
 natural and no third cards are dealt.  A 9 beats an 8 and ties are a push,
 neither side wins.

 If there are no naturals dealt in the first two cards, then additional cards
 are dealt.  The Player is the first to draw a card and must take a third card
 if their first two cards have a total of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.  If the Player
 has a total of 6 or 7 they cannot draw another card.  The following chart
 summarizes the rules for the Player's hand.

 If the first two cards total:  0-1-2-3-4-5  -  Draws a card
                                6-7          -  Stands
                                8-9          -  Stands (Natural)

 The rules for the Banker are bit more complicated and are regulated by the
 third card drawn by the player.  The following chart summarizes the rules for
 the Banker's hand.

                                   Draws when               Does not draw when
                                   player takes card        player takes card

 First two cards total:  0-1-2     Draws unless player 8-9  8
                         3         0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9      0-1-8-9
                         4         2-3-4-5-6-7              0-1-2-3-8-9
                         5         4-5-6-7                  0-1-2-3-4-5-8-9
                         6         6-7
                         7         Stands
                         8-9       Banker natural

 If Player doesn't draw a third card, the Banker draws on 0-1-2-3-4-5 and
 stands on 6-7-8-9.

 A five percent commission is charged on any winning bets made on the Banker's
 hand.  Bets on the Banker's hand and Player's hand are paid off at even money,
 but since the Bank has a slight edge there is the commission.  Ties bets are
 paid off at odds of 8 to 1.  The house has an edge of 1.35% over the Player
 and 1.20% over the Banker.  The odds against tie bets is 14.0918%.  Overall,
 the casino has a 1.27% advantage in the baccarat.  The only bet in a casino
 with lower odds are the odds bets, commonly called the back line, in craps.

 As with roulette you will see people faithfully tracking the results of the
 previously played hands.  Most casinos are more than happy to provide a
 baccarat scorecard, technically called a "Table de Banque," for those players
 who wish to keep track of the previous results.  Some may make the argument
 that, as in blackjack, the previously played cards have some bearing on the
 future cards.  However, just as in roulette, the prevailing wisdom is that the
 previous results have little significance.  But, that does not keep players
 from writing down the result of every hand in their attempt to identify
 streaks.  Of course, there are people who have made huge sums of money by
 designing systems to beat casino games.  Unfortunately, the profit has come to
 those writing the books, instead of those buying the books.

 If this all sounds confusing, it really is not.  In the past, the only way to
 learn the game was to plop a few dollars down at the table and see what
 happens.  It was typically an expensive lesson.  Today, with personal
 computers commonplace, there is no longer an excuse for not thoroughly
 understanding a game before placing any of your hard earned money on the
 table.  After playing several computer generated baccarat games, you should
 quickly get a feel for the true simplicity of the game.

 One of the earliest baccarat games for the PC was written in 1986 by Castro
 Valley, California resident Raymond M. Buti.  It was a text based program with
 a registration fee of only $3.00, but it gave a lot of good information about
 the game.  The screen displays a scorecard for tracking past hands, the
 Banker's and Player's current hand, statistics on the current session and an
 options box.  One of the options is the ability to display a menu of some of
 the most popular betting systems for playing the game.  Most systems are more
 of a money management technique, than a way to beat the game, but some people
 will swear by them.

 The Martingale system is very well-known, not only for baccarat, but for
 virtually any casino game.  The basics of Martingale are to start with a
 single betting unit and after a loss to double that betting unit, and continue
 doubling the bet until you win a hand.  The problem with this type of system
 is the table limit which could be reached after progressing through a handful
 of doubling your bets.  D'Alembert is another old system based on the doubling
 of bets, so the table limit will eventually catch up with you with that system
 too.  Thirty-One is another double up system but with a limit of 31 units.
 One system called Best Bet, while not guaranteeing that you will walk away a
 winner, does make more sense since it involves increasing your bets while you
 are winning.  It uses a progressive betting pattern of 1, 2, 3, 5, 5 and then
 8 betting units that are increased only after a win.  Start with a betting
 unit of 1 and keep betting that amount until you win a bet.  After a winning
 bet, jump to the next bet in the series until a bet is lost.

 The systems are interesting, and are a very nice touch to Mr. Buti's program,
 but no system should be seriously considered as a way to win at the casinos.
 In the documentation for his baccarat game he puts it quite well.  "Remember
 that there aren't any sure fire ways of making money gambling.  There are ways
 of minimizing your loses or methods that can be used to increase your chances
 of winning the maximum amount during your stay at a table or even methods that
 allow you to play the best possible bets at any one game.  None will guarantee
 a winning strategy in the long run.  Most all gambling systems work for the
 short play in one way or the other.  But to sit and use a system for hours on
 end will eventually put you in the poor house."

 The best application of Baccarat for the PC is Ultimate Baccarat by Accidental
 Software of Apple Valley, California.  Terry Hastings has written a true
 animated, interactive baccarat simulation and the full featured program can be
 played with up to three computer generated players.  A nice touch are the
 comments, and the expressions on the faces, of the animated players.  If you
 take some time placing your bet, the old man will doze off on you.  Accidental
 Software pokes fun at itself with their motto "If it's good it's accidental,"
 but the reality is that they have an entire line of wonderful Shareware casino
 games.

 Ultimate Baccarat includes a comprehensive tutor to help players learn the
 rules of the game, an option which can be toggled on or off.  When using the
 tutor a large curtain drops down in the center of the game screen and the
 player will be provided with an explanation of the game as it proceeds.  Each
 step in the game play is explained.  There is also a "Baccarat Info" option
 which provides general information concerning baccarat, commissions, game
 play, payoffs and a table of rules governing card draws.  There are options to
 display the statistics and results for each player at the table.  So, the
 program does furnish everything needed to learn this mis-understood casino
 game.

 The benefits of registering Ultimate Baccarat include the elimination of the
 on-screen registration reminders, the ability to save all game information,
 to play with up to six human players at one time, Sound Blaster support is
 provided and with the optional voice support you can hear digital recordings
 of the words seen in the talk balloons.  The one complaint with the Shareware
 version, but it is a pretty good incentive to pay the $13.00 registration, is
 that no sound card support is provided.  It would be interesting to hear,
 rather than read, the sometimes hilarious comments of the computer players.

 Baccarat has always been the casino's class game with an appeal to the high-
 rollers.  Until recently, the casinos seemed quite satisfied with perpetrating
 that intrigue.  Black-tie baccarat, with casino personnel in formal attire, is
 intimating to many people.  In an effort to entice some to try the fastest
 game in town, the casinos employ attractive young ladies to sit at the
 baccarat tables to get the game started.  The casinos call them starters, but
 they are more commonly referred to as shills.  While this was the predominant
 approach in the past, it was not that successful in developing a new
 generation of baccarat players.  Over the last decade, the casinos have taken
 a different approach by placing some mini-baccarat tables on the casino floor.
 These tables are slightly larger than a blackjack table and are designed for
 seven players instead of the more traditional twelve players.  Since mini-
 baccarat tables have lower minimum bets, it does give more people exposure to
 the "Big Nine Game" of baccarat.

 The casino's are at a cross-roads and have no choice but to try to generate
 interest in the traditional casino games.  It is getting to the point that it
 is difficult to distinguish between a major casino and a video arcade.  When
 the trend is trading in gaming tables for video games and trying to turn Las
 Vegas into kiddie land, you have to wonder just how much longer more
 traditional casino games like baccarat will be around.  The casinos are
 concerned and do worry about where the next generation of gamers will come
 from.  They are even gambling with their traditional base of support by trying
 to make an adult playground into a family vacation destination.  It may not be
 realistic to think that this will be the salvation of the gaming industry, but
 only time will tell how long this diametrical approach will survive.

 No BBS Contest for ONE BBSCON '95
 ---------------------------------

 It had been one of the traditional mainstays of the ONE BBSCON.  It was also
 one of the most well-known and popular aspects of the convention.  It
 generated plenty of excitement and activity throughout the BBS community.  It
 could be, arguably, what launched the ONE BBSCON to its current level of
 success.  It is Boardwatch Magazine's Reader's Choice Top 100 Bulletin Boards
 Contest.  Boardwatch Magazine editor Jack Rickard confirmed, in the magazine's
 June 1995 issue, that there will not be a BBS contest held in connection with
 this summer's ONE BBSCON in Tampa.

 In the June 1995 "Letters to the Editor" section of Boardwatch Magazine, Jack
 Rickard confirmed the rumors.  There will be no BBS contest this year.  The
 reasons he gave in his reply to an inquiry were that "it was expensive for us
 - about $30,000, and we received a lot of complaints about the rules (we only
 had one) the results (I didn't win) and the process (the other guy is buying
 it)."  He also indicated that they were very busy publishing the magazine and
 putting on the convention, which was part of what lead to the decision not to
 run the BBS contest this year.

 The Reader's Choice BBS Contest is a ONE BBSCON tradition which has fallen by
 the wayside.  What's next, doing away with the "How to Run a BBS for Profit"
 educational session?  Jack Rickard said they "may revive it in 1996, though
 probably in a seriously modified form."  I hope the contest returns for next
 year.  It was an excellent way to promote the ONE BBSCON and is in part
 responsible for the success that the event has enjoyed.

 Editor's Note:  The July issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine will be a very
 special ONE BBSCON '95 Commemorative Issue.  There will be a special ONE
 BBSCON '95 file with the most information available anywhere prior to the
 actual event itself.  The main magazine file will also have a "ONE BBSCON '95
 Simulation" which will take a look at how things should come off for the
 event.  Do not miss next month's exciting issue!  For more information on ONE
 BBSCON '95 contact ONE, Inc., 4255 South Buckley Road, Suite 308, Aurora, CO
 80013, or call (303) 693-5253.

 1995 PCBoard Communications Conference Update
 ---------------------------------------------

 Clark Development Company (CDC), designers of the popular PCBoard BBS
 Software, has recently announced some of the details for their 1995 PCBoard
 Communications Conference.  The conference for PCBoard Sysops will take place
 at The Inn at Prospector Square in Park City, Utah, on September 21-24, 1995.

 The prices for the conference have been set and CDC is now taking
 registrations, which is limited to 400 attendees.  Prices for the show have
 been set at $199.00 for registrations received by July 31, 1995, $249.00 for
 registrations received by August 31, 1995 and $299.00 after that.  Attendees
 will have two days of intense educational sessions, demonstrations of the
 latest enhancements to PCBoard, and the first public showing of their new
 client/server, graphical communications software that brings together BBSs and
 the Internet.

 Included in the registration fee is the following:  Admission to the Keynote
 dinner, admission to all educational sessions, admission to the vendor
 exhibits, an attache style bag to hold notebooks and handouts, an exclusive
 collectors PCBoard mock-turtleneck sweatshirt, a PCBoard note-pad and pen,
 a PCBoard CD-ROM, admission to the Keynote Dinner on Thursday, breakfast on
 Friday, the session break and lunch on Friday, a dinner activity on Friday
 (probably a wagon ride and BBQ), breakfast and session break on Saturday, and
 lunch on Saturday.

 CDC has booked the whole resort, including hotel rooms, studios, and one, two
 and three bedroom condos.  The daily rates are $55.00 for a hotel room, $63.00
 for a studio, $120.00 for a two bedroom condo and $160.00 for a three bedroom
 condo.  All studios and condos include kitchens.  The Inn at Prospector
 Square, with 250 units, is the largest facility in Park City.  It offers free
 shuttle bus service, exercise rooms, a pool, a hot tub and some rooms even
 have a fireplace.

 Park City sits at an elevation of 7,000 feet and may have remained the domain
 of Indians and trappers had it not been for the discovery of a rich silver ore
 in October of 1868.  The town grew steadily and was incorporated in the late
 1880's.  Today, with a population of 4,468, Park City is a popular year round
 vacation destination with a heavy emphasis on winter sports.  Utah's strong
 Mormon influence leads to some strange liquor laws including 3.2% beer and
 State run liquor stores.

 There is much to see and do in the Park City area for those attending the 1995
 PCBoard Communications Conference.  There are several ways to check out the
 local scenery from the air including glider rides.  Five different companies
 offer daily hot air balloon rides including a "Traditional Champagne
 Celebration" after the flight, but non-alcoholic champagne is also available.
 There is fly fishing for brown, rainbow and cutthroat trout in spectacular
 canyons and mountain streams.  Casting instruction is available for those who
 are not familiar with fly fishing.  Visitors can learn about the early mining
 history of the region at the Park City Old Town Museum, explore any one of
 sixteen art galleries, or take in a movie at the Sundance Theatre.  Guests can
 also ride a restored turn of the century steam railroad, take part in jeep and
 mountain bike tours, try scuba diving in hot springs, or go white-water
 rafting on the Yampa and Green Rivers.  Visitors can also take part in golf,
 hiking, horseback riding, swimming, tennis and water skiing.

 Another diversion for those visiting this part of the Beehive State is a trek
 across the wasteland known as the Great Salt Lake Desert.  This trip takes you
 along the southern shores of the Great Salt Lake on Interstate 80 then, after
 traveling approximately 150 miles, to the famous Bonneville Speedway.  This is
 the historic site of many land speed records set on the salt flats.  Plus, it
 is only about ten miles from the Nevada state line.  Wendover is a small town
 on the Nevada state line with only 1,127 residents, but people are bused in
 from Salt Lake City on gambling tours.

 For those who enjoy winter sports, you might wish to plan a return trip in the
 Winter months.  Belgian horses pulling turn of the century antique bobsleds
 is ideal for a family outing or a romantic evening.  While many people come
 for the skiing at Deer Valley or Park City ski areas, there is also cross
 country skiing, ice fishing, ice skating, ski jumping, snow-boarding,
 snowmobiling and snowshoe tours to take part in.

 CD-ROMs
 -------

 Written by Alex Thomas, New Port Richey, FL
 Courtesy of Paul Pollack, New Port Richey, FL

 CD-ROM.  The name first started with CD, or the compact disc, which hit the
 market with a storm.  Because of the high quality for these discs, including
 the almost impossibility of scratching and breaking, and the high quality
 sound, the CD hardware (originating from Japan, where else?) caught some
 attention in the computer market.  I don't know the full history of CDs, (or
 even half of it) but I can tell you a lot about the current software coming
 out, via magazines, and the Data Superhighway.  The end of the name, ROM,
 stands for Read Only Memory, because you can't write to CDs, at least not yet.

 OK, you're probably confused about the CD-ROM systems (and if not, please
 contact me).  Their speed, how much will it affect gameplay?  The graphics,
 does it enhance them any?  Exactly what makes the CD-ROM system worth coughing
 up the extra $200 to $1000 dollars on your computer instead of those bills you
 were supposed to pay, a few months ago.

 First of all, before you can walk, you crawl, so before you get the software,
 you need the hardware.  Which is best?  I can't answer that, because it
 depends on what you want the CD-ROM for.  Want a CD for games?  You'll
 probably want something that costs less, like a Sega CD, or Nintendo's new
 "Project Reality" when it comes out.  Need a CD for business?  Best bet is
 probably to go for a faster computer CD-ROM, say, a quad speed, to load all
 those Windows programs.  Ya hoo.  The first CD out was the single speed CD-ROM
 system, followed closely by the Sega CD, and then the double speed CD-ROM.
 Barely out now is the triple speed, and coming in the future will be the quad
 speed.  Of course, I recently found out that the quad speed is 10 times slower
 than the average 386 IBM computer's hard disk.  If we keep increasing these
 speeds, though, we'll start hearing computer conversation like this:  "So, you
 thinking about getting that new dodeca speed CD-ROM?"  "I don't know.  My
 Hecta speed CD-ROM is starting to drag behind in times."  Now wouldn't THAT be
 something horrible to hear?  Ok, so maybe not, but it would get pretty
 confusing after a while.

 There sure are a lot of systems, though, considering the first CD-ROM system
 just entered the market a few years ago.  For my birthday, (June 7th) I'm
 getting a Sega CDX.  Heh, heh, heh.  The CDX is a new Sega CD-ROM system,
 which, in addition to playing their CD games on, you can play the Genesis
 cartridges, music CDs, Kodak CD photos, and I think, maybe even IBM CD-ROM
 discs.  Don't get the idea I'm rich or anything.  I have to pay for half of
 it, ($115) which I earned by mowing lawns and doing chores around the house.
 Back to the subject:  you (actually I was simulating you) were asking why
 anybody would want a CD-ROM system.  Well, I think most of it is because the
 people using the system don't have to know how to use the system (DOS or
 otherwise).  All you have to do is put the CD in the drive, and when they're
 finished, take it out.  Bada bing, bada boom, you're done.  Some other, more
 sophisticated reasons for wanting a CD-ROM system, is because yes, a CD does
 have an increased capacity for music, and speech, and is capable of displaying
 better resolution graphics.  Unless the software you're using was made for the
 CD, although, you're probably not going to get a big difference in the
 program, and there are very few programs out right now that are made
 specifically for the computer CD-ROM system.

 Me?  OK, so you didn't really ask about me, but that's tough, I'm gonna tell
 you anyhow.  Hmmmmm... nobody's really asked what I like (including you) but
 I'd say, it, right now, would have to be the Sega CDX, considering that all
 its games ARE made specifically for the Sega CDX, and not including only
 little improvements.

 So, like I said before, it's all in what you want that depends on what you
 get.  I'm not going to tell you the CD-ROM is good, and you should get one
 right now, on the double.  I'm not going to tell you they stink, and that you
 should wait until they come out later, or wait for Virtual Reality.  But just
 consider this:  while your waiting for the newest CD-ROM system to be coming
 out years from now, the rest of us will have conquered the solar system, blown
 up the monsters, and saved the princesses many times over.

 More on Florida's New 941 Area Code
 -----------------------------------

 Last month's issue, and issues prior to that, discussed the new 941 area code
 along Florida's west coast.  As of May 28, 1995 that new area code became a
 reality for residents of Charlotte, Collier, DeSoto, Glades, Hardee, Hendry,
 Highlands, Lee, Manatee, Monroe (except for the Keys which will keep their
 current 305 area code), Okeechobee, Polk and Sarasota counties.  While
 thirteen of sixteen counties had to change their area codes, the Tampa Bay
 area counties of Hillsborough, Pasco (except the northeast part currently in
 the 904 area code) and Pinellas retained the current 813 area code.  With the
 increased publicity brought about due to the implementation of the change,
 additional information is coming out about the area code shuffling.

 Until March 3, 1996, calls to locations in southwest Florida will go through
 using either area code, then a recorded message will inform the caller of the
 need for the new area code.  Local telephone service providers went to the
 extent of taking out ads in local newspapers to advise people of the changes.
 So that customers will become familiar with the changes, they are advising
 them to start using the new 941 area code right away.  They also recommend
 that people re-program automatic dialers, fax machines, cellular phones,
 modems, security alarm reporting systems and anything else to the new area
 code.  Business customers are reminded that things like business cards,
 stationary, order forms, invoices and promotional material will have to be
 modified due to the change.  For most people their local service area will not
 change and calls that are currently long-distance will remain long-distance.
 Conversely, local calls will remain local calls, but the new area code may
 have to be added prior to dialing.

 The change in area codes was necessitated by the population growth and the
 rapid increase in telecommunication applications, such as computer
 communications, cellular phones, fax machines and pagers.  The United States
 is using up telephone numbers at a rate of 360,000 a day and this was the
 seventh of eleven new area codes scheduled to be added this year.  Since each
 additional area code creates 7,920,000 new phone numbers, this should meet the
 growing demand.  Until this year, area codes have traditionally had a middle
 number of 0 or 1.  Those traditional area codes have been exhausted, so new
 area codes can no longer follow that format.

 This may not be the only change coming to Florida this year.  Southeast
 Florida will be receiving a new 954 area code in the near future and the 904
 area code is scheduled to be spilt.  The spilt in the 904 area code was
 originally scheduled to take place before the end of next year, but could
 happen as soon as December 1 of this year.  A new 850 area code will be
 assigned to residents of Hernando, northeast Pasco, Citrus, Levy, Dixie,
 Gilchrist, Alachua, Marion, Sumter, Lake, Flagler, Volusia and Seminole
 counties.  The counties north of these will be able to keep the current 904
 area code.

 Editor's Note:  The Pasco BBS Magazine will pass along any new information on
 this developing story in future issues.  Those requiring additional
 information are encouraged to contact their local telephone company.

 July 10, 1990 Press Release - Electronic Frontier Foundation Formed
 -------------------------------------------------------------------

 New Foundation Established to Encourage Computer-Based Communications
 Policies

 Washington, D.C., July 10, 1990 -- Mitchell D. Kapor, founder of Lotus
 Development Corporation and ON Technology, today announced that he, along with
 colleague John Perry Barlow, has established a foundation to address social
 and legal issues arising from the impact on society of the increasingly
 pervasive use of computers as a means of communication and information
 distribution.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) will support and
 engage in public education on current and future developments in computer-
 based and telecommunications media.  In addition, it will support litigation
 in the public interest to preserve, protect and extend First Amendment rights
 within the realm of computing and telecommunications technology.

 Initial funding for the Foundation comes from private contributions by Kapor
 and Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple Computer, Inc.  The Foundation expects
 to actively raise contributions from a wide constituency.

 As an initial step to foster public education on these issues, the Foundation
 today awarded a grant to the Palo Alto, California-based public advocacy group
 Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR).  The grant will be
 used by CPSR to expand the scope of its on-going Computing and Civil Liberties
 Project.

 Because its mission is to not only increase public awareness about civil
 liberties issues arising in the area of computer-based communications, but
 also to support litigation in the public interest, the  Foundation has
 recently intervened on behalf of two legal cases.

 The first case concerns Steve Jackson, an Austin-based game manufacturer who
 was the target of the Secret Service's Operation Sun Devil.  The EFF has
 pressed for a full disclosure by the government regarding the seizure of his
 company's computer equipment.  In the second action, the Foundation intends to
 seek amicus curiae (friend of the court) status in the government's case
 against Craig Neidorf, a 20-year-old University of Missouri student who is the
 editor of the electronic newsletter Phrack World News.

 "It is becoming increasingly obvious that the rate of technology advancement
 in communications is far outpacing the establishment of appropriate cultural,
 legal and political frameworks to handle the issues that are arising," said
 Kapor.  "And the Steve Jackson and Neidorf cases dramatically point to the
 timeliness of the Foundation's mission.  We intend to be instrumental in
 helping shape a new framework that embraces these powerful new technologies
 for the public good."

 The use of new digital media -- in the form of on-line information and
 interactive conferencing services, computer networks and electronic bulletin
 boards -- is becoming widespread in businesses and homes.  However, the
 electronic society created by these new forms of digital communications does
 not fit neatly into existing, conventional legal and social structures.

 The question of how electronic communications should be accorded the same
 political freedoms as newspapers, books, journals and other modes of discourse
 is currently the subject of discussion among this country's lawmakers and
 members of the computer industry.  The EFF will take an active role in these
 discussions through its continued funding of various educational projects and
 forums.

 An important facet of the Foundation's mission is to help both the public and
 policy-makers see and understand the opportunities as well as the challenges
 posed by developments in computing and telecommunications.  Also, the EFF will
 encourage and support the development of new software to enable non-technical
 users to more easily use their computers to access the growing number of
 digital communications services available.

 PBM Flashback - July 1993
 -------------------------

 During the middle of 1993, "The Best of CyberScape LIVE!" appeared in several
 issues of the Pasco BBS Magazine.  These were live on-line interviews that
 took place on the CyberScape BBS located in Lancaster, Massachusetts.  Dave
 White was the Sysop of the CyberScape BBS and the host for the interviews.
 The editor of the Pasco BBS Magazine was introduced to Dave White through Dan
 Linton, Sysop of the Software Creations BBS, who he had interviewed several
 months earlier.  Unfortunately, we sort of lost track of Dave when he took the
 BBS down to purse other opportunities.  But, it was an enjoyable way to spend
 a Sunday evening with people jumping in to ask different questions.

 On June 13, 1993, David Hamel, best known as the author of the Boxer Text
 Editor, was the special guest and the transcript appeared in the July 1993
 issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine.  Duane Morin, a Shareware author from
 Worcester, Massachusetts and Jeremy Frerichs, a student from Leominster,
 Massachusetts joined Dave White and Richard Ziegler for the on-line interview
 with David Hamel.  This PBM Flashback is a bit longer than past installments
 have been, but we wanted to give you a taste of how much fun "The Best of
 CyberScape LIVE!" was.  The sessions appeared just as they did in the Chat
 Conference on the old CyberScape BBS.

 David Hamel:  Programming is a very natural thing for me, and always has been.
 I find it to be almost second nature.  I got started with the programmable TI
 calculators, then the Radio Shack Color Computer, and then on to the Atari ST
 and to PCs.

 Duane Morin:  Have you worked on shareware programs in the past, or is Boxer
 pretty much your first major release?

 David Hamel:  No - BOXER is my first effort.  It evolved not from a plan to
 create a Shareware product, but from an interest I took in text editors.
 BOXER spent 5 years in "secrecy" with just a few friends using it.

 Duane Morin:  How did you keep such a project alive for 5 years without it
 being, well, productive?  I.e.  I take it you didn't do it for the money?? <g>

 David Hamel:  That's a good question.  I've got a talent for seeing things
 through to completion.  It was done as a hobby - there was no money to support
 the initial development, just time.

 Duane Morin:  A spare time, thing?  You had a full-time job as well?

 David Hamel:  Oh yes.  I had been working all through BOXER's early
 development.  I'd routinely quiz people about editors they'd used and try to
 collect ideas.  I ran the project pretty seriously, but it was all for fun -
 initially.

 Duane Morin:  Any suggestions for seeing shareware programming as "fun" and
 not as a second job?  I'm running into this problem myself at the moment.

 David Hamel:  I think the *best* way to approach Shareware is for fun, and not
 for profit.  That is a far more reasonable approach, since so few make real
 money anyway.  But, if you're talented, and you've got incredible persistence,
 you might make some money after all.

 Dave White:  What advice would you give to aspiring young programmers with
 regard to shareware and programming in general?

 David Hamel:  Find a project which has genuine interest for you.  Trying to
 learn programming by writing a program which holds no interest for you doesn't
 work very well.  This is often what happens in programming courses.  But when
 a programmer is truly interested in his work, then magic things can happen.

 Duane Morin:  Why did you choose a text editor?  Was it tough to compete with
 other popular editors, like PC-Write, Emacs?

 David Hamel:  I felt that a text editor embodied many different aspects of
 programming: memory management, searching, sorting, screen display, user
 interface.  As such, it seemed a neat thing to tackle.

 Dave White:  What marketing techniques have you found to be the most
 successful?

 David Hamel:  The BBS distribution channel supplies about 2/3 of my registered
 users, so that has certainly been important to me.  While not literally a
 "technique", I believe that the attention to detail in BOXER is what initially
 got people excited about it, and what hooks people.  It's funny, because
 "attention to detail" isn't something that you find in a bulleted feature
 list.  It's a hard thing to sell.  But after people try BOXER, that's what
 they're reacting to, most often.

 Duane Morin:  So are you supporting yourself on BOXER now?  You mentioned
 before dedicating all your time to it.

 David Hamel:  Yes - I've been doing BOXER full-time since 9/91.  I quit my
 consulting job a bit before I should have, but BOXER had shown promise, and I
 wanted to follow my heart.  I've been flattered by the praise I've received.

 Duane Morin:  So with a little dedication a programmer CAN support him/herself
 on the registrations of even ONE strong product?

 David Hamel:  Yes, in some cases.  I don't recommend starting with that hope,
 though.  Do it because you love it.  Dedicate yourself beyond belief.  Have
 remarkable patience, and some talent.  Then it may come.  (Sorry to add so
 many qualifiers :-)

 Richard Ziegler:  My time is running out!

 Dave White:  uh oh...  I'll be back in a minute.

 Duane Morin:   Whoops, I think we lost Richard and Dave for the moment.

 Jeremy Frerichs:  Dave is giving Richard more time...

 Dave White:  We lost Rich...  Hopefully he'll be back!

 Richard Ziegler:  I'm back <grin>.

 Duane Morin:  Have you got a "favorite" shareware program?  Something someone
 else wrote that just impresses your socks off?

 David Hamel:  Favorite program?  Oh boy!  I really don't get a chance to see
 all the neat things people are doing.  I'd say the best program is definitely
 %6%^%$$]]4]55 -Whoa- Did you see that line noise!!  ;-)

 Duane Morin:  I don't think we saw your answer there...the best program you've
 seen is..?

 David Hamel:  (line noise) A clever question avoidance technique.  :-)

 Duane Morin:  Ah, sorry.  Faked me outta my socks.

 David Hamel:  Well, put 'em back on.

 Editor's Note:  PBM Flashback will appear on a regular basis in future issues.
 Most issues will have this brief look back at some of the features which have
 appeared over the history of the Pasco BBS Magazine.

 Telix Special Celebrates Ten Years
 ----------------------------------

 deltaComm Development, Inc. has announced a special discount on their popular
 telecommunications package Telix.  The special price of $69.00 for the Windows
 version and $59.00 for the DOS version is being offered to celebrate ten years
 of the Shareware program.  This limited time offer saves people $30.00 on the
 Windows version and $10.00 on the version for DOS.

 While a history of Telix would have been a welcome addition to the
 informational file announcing the offer, there was a brief comment contained
 within the archive's description file.  "Ten years ago, in the basement of a
 Toronto house, Telix was born.  Ten years later, its still the best value in
 communications.  Order your copy at this low price today, because you may not
 see a deal this good until Telix turns twenty."

 Since the current product packaging for Telix is being redesigned and
 reprinted, this offer is only valid while supplies of the current packaging
 last.  deltaComm Development, Inc. had 2,200 copies on hand as of May 23,
 1995, and this offer expires on August 1, 1995.

 Editor's Note:  For more information on Telix and this special offer contact

 Freeware Hall of Fame
 ---------------------

 Charlottesville, VA - Owning a computer doesn't require spending a fortune for
 computer software.  Good software that doesn't cost a dime is available to do
 most any job, according to Rey Barry, a retired real estate broker who founded
 the "Freeware Hall of Fame"(sm).

 "There are so many first-rate free programs for DOS and Windows you can do
 practically anything when you know what to look for and how to find it," Barry
 says.

 To make his point he published "The Freeware Hall of Fame Guide to Free
 Software," a 96-page paperback available by mail order.  It describes 1,743
 programs free for personal use, and tells how to find them on the Internet and
 neighborhood Bulletin Boards.

 In May, BBS Magazine called the collection, "... some of the finest utilities
 and applications available.  Many are tools that you couldn't find elsewhere
 at any price."

 From A to Z they range from archivers that store or back-up files to a postal
 Zip Code bulk mail manager.  Included are word processors, loan analyzers,
 hard drive file managers, spelling checkers, legal forms, schedule planners,
 multi-media viewers and creators, modem communication programs, collector
 databases, aviation and maritime programs, network utilities, programs to
 convert nearly anything to something else, and 100 programs to manage the
 Internet and other on-line services.

 Databases list the telephone area codes for the entire world, thousands of
 songs and composers, a year-by-year review of United States culture, and a
 nationwide list of hamburger chain radio channels.  Tune in with a scanner and
 hear orders being placed at the neighborhood drive in.

 Whether for profit or for fun it's all free, and some things are found only in
 Freeware.  For example, Barry says the only DOS program to assign jobs to the
 keyboard's F-11 and F-12 keys is Freeware.

 The Hall of Fame, or FreeHOF as it's known, had its origins in 1984 when Barry
 began looking for software to run his real estate office.  "I was amazed that
 the Freeware found on Bulletin Boards was sometimes better than retail
 software costing hundreds of dollars, and I began collecting it," Barry
 explains.

 Who writes free software?  According to Barry some of the authors "rank with
 the best in the profession, employed by the most advanced governments and
 industries.  The Freeware they write on their own time often reflects the
 highest level of concept and execution."

 By 1989 the collection was so large and diverse Barry named it the Freeware
 Hall of Fame and began mailing choice Freeware to Bulletin Boards in the US,
 Canada and Western Europe that were members of the ILink International Netmail
 Network(sm) where Barry is an administrator.

 Three years later he opened the FreeHOF BBS and currently more than 300
 Bulletin Board operators on three continents regularly call in to download and
 upload Freeware.  "So far as I can discover, it's the world's only BBS
 dedicated to Freeware, Public Domain and $0 Shareware" Barry says.

 The Guide to Free Software singles out what Barry calls "the circle of Great
 Freeware Writers legendary for the quantity and quality of their Free
 programs, or for their impact on the PC industry."  He says nearly every PC in
 the world runs at least one Freeware utility by an author in that circle.

 "People don't think of those as Freeware but as programs that 'came with the
 computer,' as indeed they did," he says.

 The Guide has two parts.  One lists applications and databases in 105
 categories.  The second is an alphabetized list naming more than 1,000
 Freeware writers and their programs.  Barry notes that 13 of the most prolific
 writers account for more than 180 entries in the Guide.

 An introduction gives tips on the best way to find the newest releases of
 these programs on the Internet and neighborhood Bulletin Boards - and suggests
 who should NOT be using the Internet to search (people who pay their own INET
 bill.)  The introduction also tells how to keep computers safe from
 destructive viruses and trojans.

 The Guide is available for $20 from the Freeware Hall of Fame, 1561 Dairy
 Road, Charlottesville, VA 22903-1303.  No charge for VA sales tax or postage.
 The book is expected to be in book stores nationwide by the end of the year,
 probably at a higher price.

 Next Month
 ----------

 The August 1995 issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine will be a "Special ONE BBSCON
 '95 Commemorative Issue."  This issue will include a separate file with all
 kinds of information about this summer's event in Tampa.  There will also be
 an article in the main magazine file called "ONE BBSCON '95 Simulation."  This
 issue should have more information on ONE BBSCON '95 than you will find in any
 other source, with the possible exception of the actual program purchased at
 the event itself.  Include all our regular features on top of that, not to
 mention all the latest BBS news, and it makes for a very special issue.

 Do not miss the August issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine, which will be
 available on or before July 22.
