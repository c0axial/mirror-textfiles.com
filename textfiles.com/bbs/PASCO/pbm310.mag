 Editor's Welcome
 ----------------

 As with the past October issues of the Pasco BBS Magazine, this issue has full
 coverage of the ONE BBSCON.  In case you are not aware of it, which means that
 you are not a regular reader of this publication, the ultimate on-line event
 was held in Tampa this past August.  With this issue we continue with the most
 comprehensive coverage of ONE BBSCON '95 found anywhere.  A very special event
 was made even more special by the fact that it was held on our own home turf.
 This issue includes an article on what people were saying about the Tampa Bay
 area.

 Along with looking at the latest news, this issue also takes a look at how
 MicroSoft lead people down the "Hype Highway" with the release of Windows 95.
 There is also a wonderful review of Heretic:  City of the Damned, written by
 our resident game guru Paul Pollack.  Of course, all our regular features are
 back as well.

 Before concluding this month's openning comments, I want to take a moment to
 thank Rob Marlowe of the Inner Sanctum BBS here in New Port Richey.  Rob has
 setup a home page on the World Wide Web for the Pasco BBS Magazine on his
 system.  Now the Pasco BBS Magazine can be read on the Internet at
 http://www.sanctum.com/pasco.  People can also telenet into his BBS at
 sanctum.com and use his gateway to reach the home board of this publication,
 the Board of Trade BBS.  While you're there, I hope you take some time to
 check out Rob's great board, which is the oldest BBS in Pasco County.  Thanks
 Rob!

 'Til next month, thanks for reading!

 ONE BBSCON '95 - A Moment in Time
 ---------------------------------

 The Online Networking Exposition and BBS Convention 1995, better known as ONE
 BBSCON '95, did indeed take place in Tampa from August 16-20, 1995.  Now that
 the frenzy has receded, it is still difficult to believe that the ultimate on-
 line gathering was held in our community.  A well deserved thanks goes to Jack
 Rickard, Phil Becker and all the staff at ONE, Inc. for putting on another
 wonderful show.  Thanks as well for bringing this show to the Tampa Bay area.
 It was a blast!  This article will look back at some of the events of this
 past August, the highlights, the low-lights and a taste of the ONE BBSCON
 experience.  There is also a separate article in this issue about what people
 said about our fair community.  Next month's issue will have a couple of
 follow-up reports and no doubt the Pasco BBS Magazine will be talking about
 ONE BBSCON '95, the Tampa BBSCON, for years to come.

 While the final numbers are not in, it appears that somewhere between 4,000
 and 5,000 people made the annual pilgrimage to the BBSCON.  While this was a
 bit lower than initial estimates, the attendance was up from last year and the
 total made for the largest gathering of telecommunications enthusiasts in
 history.  There is no argument that it was the biggest event in the history of
 the Tampa Bay on-line community.  It could be that this will remain Tampa
 Bay's biggest on-line event well into the next century.

 Attending a convention in your own home area is a bit different.  People at
 work will ask where you are going on your vacation and then give you a strange
 look when you answer Tampa.  Then you have to decide if you should pop for a
 hotel room or not.  Driving back and forth each day has its obvious benefits
 and problems.  As a matter of fact, despite the fact that the convention was
 being held in Tampa, and there was no doubt whatsoever that I would attend, I
 did not attempt to make any hotel reservations until the day before the show
 started.  So, needless to say, I did not get to stay at the cheaper hotel
 nearest the Convention Center.  However, I opted to stay down there two
 nights.  But, I will talk more about the hotel and the decision to drive home
 as this chronology continues.

 After checking into the hotel on Wednesday afternoon, I took a walk over to
 the Hyatt to register for the BBSCON.  Unfortunately, the registration was
 being held at the Convention Center.  So, I did make the trek from the Holiday
 Inn, behind the Performing Acts Center, to the Convention Center and back.  It
 is a bit of a hike, one I did not choose to repeat.  It certainly was hot, but
 I guess that should be no surprise.  After all, it was August in Florida!

 After getting back to the hotel, I took a closer look at my ID badge.  I
 noticed that I was from 'New Port Rickey, Florida.'  My first thought was that
 someone on the ONE, Inc. staff was a big fan of the old I Love Lucy show.  My
 second thought was that I probably should get the badge changed instead of
 keeping track of how many times someone asked where is New Port Rickey?  Then
 I would have to explain it is actually New Port Richey, the badge is wrong.
 That night, when I bumped into Inner Sanctum Sysop Rob Marlowe, his name badge
 said New Port Rickey too.  I guess the same Lucy fan did his badge.  I did
 eventually get mine changed, Rob left his the way it was.

 I had no intention of walking to the Convention Center, again, so I took one
 of the shuttle buses to Wednesday evening's Welcoming Reception.  The shuttle
 buses from the hotels to the Convention Center worked great, there seemed to
 be one every 15 minutes.  The buses had advertisements on the side for eSoft,
 ONE BBSCON '96 and other BBSCON related items.  It was different, and perhaps
 a bit exciting, to see buses running around Tampa advertising BBS related
 products.  It certainly added to the atmosphere of hosting the BBSCON.

 It was a pleasant evening on the Tampa Convention Center's River-walk for the
 Welcoming Reception.  Perhaps, a little warm, but not too bad.  There was a
 light breeze coming off the water, and with illuminated paddle boats in the
 channel, it made for a delightful locale.  It was an evening full of
 conversation with people from around town and around the world.  I ran into
 people I met at previous BBSCONs.  One Sysop from Tennessee asked if I had
 "some sort of pull to get this thing in my own home state."  No, I did not
 have anything to do with it, but this year's BBSCON was definitely a home
 game.  There was a buffet and the food was quite good.  The coconut chicken
 went over big, and that comes from a guy who doesn't even like coconut.  If
 you want to compare this year's Welcoming Reception to the last couple, I will
 be happy to pass along my opinion.  I would say the Welcoming Reception was
 somewhere between Colorado Springs and Atlanta.  It is tough to top the first
 one, but it was definitely better than last year.

 When I returned to the hotel, I took some time to look out the window.   Both
 nights I stayed in Tampa, my hotel room window faced north.  I wished that at
 least one of the nights the room faced south, so I could have had a better
 view of the downtown area itself, but I never went to the extent of requesting
 a different room.  However, there was a nice view of the Hillsborough River
 and part of the beautiful University of Tampa campus.  Tampa Stadium was off
 in the distance and I could watch the sunset over Tampa Stadium, which was
 somewhat poetic considering all the talk of building a new stadium.  I
 certainly hope that civic leaders and residents are not so nearsighted, as to
 not build a new stadium.  If Tampa does not build a new stadium, there are
 plenty of communities who recognize the value of a NFL team and will do so if
 we do not.  But, I guess that is a bit off-topic.

 Thursday morning, I checked-out of the hotel and drove the short distance to
 the Convention Center, a short distance by car anyway.  At last year's
 Welcoming Session they had donuts and coffee free for the taking.  Since I did
 not take the time to stop and have breakfast, I hoped that would be the case
 again this year.  Unfortunately, there was nothing like that, but there was
 coffee you could buy for $1.50 a cup.

 Thursday morning's Opening Session took place in a rock concert atmosphere.
 The lights were down very low and music played in the background.  The
 colorful ONE BBSCON '95 logo was displayed on two huge projection screens,
 bleachers were set-up and a laser light show took place after Phil Becker's
 talk.  When the lights went out, I almost expected to see controlled
 substances circulating through the crowd.  It was quite dark and half the time
 I did not know if my tape recorder was getting anything, so I did end up
 having to shell out some money for the audio tapes of that session.

 Jack Rickard began the Opening Session by welcoming everyone to ONE BBSCON
 '95.  He talked for a few minutes before introducing members of the ONE BBSCON
 Executive Advisory Board.  He also explained why the concept of the EAB was
 used for the conventions.  The idea was "to form an Executive Advisory Board
 with different people representing different focuses of the on-line community.
 I think this has been fairly successful.  We've got very good representation
 here this year."  Several members of the board did speak to the assemblage.

 Next month's issue will take a longer look at the Association of Online
 Professionals, so we will save some of the organization's Executive Director's
 remarks for next month.  But, we did want to share some of Jack Rickard's
 humor while he introduced David McClure.  Rickard began by talking about other
 attempts to form a Sysop Association.  "Every year it seemed there was someone
 who came up with the idea of forming some sort of association of bulletin
 board operators.  I watched quite a parade of them come out, announce
 something, hope for 15,000 or 20,000 members instantly and when they didn't
 materialize, move on.  The question is why can't we get all the BBS operators
 to do x, whatever x is.  Basically, I didn't know.  I had never seen all the
 bulletin board operators do anything.  If you got all the bulletin board
 operators in the world, and laid them end-to-end, they couldn't reach a
 conclusion, much less lunch.  They are a fairly independent group of people
 and getting them to do anything is a lot like herding cats.  I think one of
 the reasons they run bulletin boards, on-line services and their own Web sites
 is that the rest of the world didn't do to suit them.  So, they built another
 one where they could have a little control and do it their way."

 Rickard continued with his introduction.  "Politically, almost all of the
 bulletin board operators tend to be Libertarians.  None of them actually join
 the Libertarian Party, there's too many rules, you don't really buy into all
 of it, but the tendency is towards Libertarianism, just don't want to actually
 become a member.  When we started Boardwatch Magazine people who ran on-line
 services were viewed much as you might a group of people who met every Tuesday
 evening to exchange toothbrushes.  They do what?  Why do they do that?  In
 recent years, it's not that much of a niche.  This has gone quite into the
 national eye and its become a bit of a mainstream thing.  It also lead to a
 curious desire by our governing structure to do two things, one is to regulate
 it, and the other is tax it.  To defend ourselves we are going to have to make
 some concessions on the I don't join and I don't get involved position.  The
 first organization I've joined in ten years is now this Association of On-Line
 Professionals."

 After some opening remarks from several members of the Executive Advisory
 Board, Phil Becker gave his traditional state of the industry report.  Becker
 presented a history of on-line, including a slide show featuring ads and
 articles from years gone by.  When Phil Becker concluded his remarks, the
 second annual BBSCON laser light show took place.  Each year Becker tries to
 top the year before, which has lead to a very elaborate laser light show the
 past two years.  This was the highlight of the rock and roll aspect of the
 Opening Session.

 The last one to speak at the Opening Session is the Keynote Speaker and Dr.
 Robert M. Metcalfe had that honor in Tampa.  Metcalfe is best known as the
 inventor of the local area network technology ethernet and as a columnist for
 InfoWorld Magazine.  His Keynote Address discussed "Convergence and the
 Information Superhighway."  Bob Metcalfe began his speech, "If you think the
 Information Superhighway is a buzz word that takes itself too seriously, I
 want to tell you my favorite anagram of the word Information Superhighway.  An
 anagram is simply a rearrangement of the letters and there are dozens of
 anagrams for the phrase Information Superhighway.  My favorite is this,
 Enormous Hairy Pig With Fan."  He also spent some time discussing the
 Internet.  "Some people think that the Internet is this collection of fiber
 optics that go across the country and connect everyone together.  When,
 actually, the Internet is mostly ethernets connected together.  This is how I
 get to be the inventor of the Internet.  There are a lot of people vying to be
 the inventor of the Internet, so this is my way of getting my oar in too."

 After the Opening Session, it is time for the first lunch break of the
 convention.  That first lunch was a bit disappointing, especially after the
 lack of coffee and donuts that morning.  They served a box type lunch.  This
 was a chicken sandwich with something that looked like a tomato and something
 else brown that had a resemblance to lettuce.  The banana was yellow, I guess
 that is one good thing.  The second day's lunch was nothing to brag about
 either, basically a variety of different salads.  It was a little downgrade in
 the food from last year's convention.  Saturday's chicken and ham lunch was
 the best of the show, nothing to brag about, but reasonable in comparison to
 the other meals.  Following lunch, the educational sessions and vendor
 exhibits kicked off at 1:30 pm on Thursday.

 One of the BBSCON traditions continues to be The Jack and Phil Show, which is
 an educational session put on by convention organizers Jack Rickard and Phil
 Becker.  Jack Rickard looked back at the first Jack and Phil Show, held the
 year before the first ONE BBSCON, and talked about how the session remains
 applicable with today's explosion of the Internet.  "The original session we
 did at FIDOCON91, 'How to Make Money with a BBS,' seems a little quaint now.
 At the time we had people screaming blaspheme and so forth, but it was a very
 popular session.  But, I think there has been something happening in the last
 year that almost makes it relevant again, we're back where we were in 1991.  A
 number of bulletin board operators are terribly uncertain about where the
 future of on-line is going.  The answer to the question is that most of you in
 this room already went through this once, you know how it's going to come out.
 It's the rest of the world that should be confused and they are."  Phil Becker
 added, "Nothing that is happening now is new, except in scale."

 Rickard and Becker also discussed the traditional rumors how the large
 telecommunications companies would somehow eventually control on-line
 communications.  Jack Rickard began, "How can this be when MCI, Sprint and the
 big telephone companies are going to crush all of us?  It has to do with
 something bulletin board operators do better than these other groups can, and
 it is called customer service.  Try this, when you go home call the cable
 company and tell them your TV does not work, and then can you help me install
 WinSock?"  Phil Becker continued on the same topic.  "In yesterday's USA
 Today, AT&T announced that they're going to monopolize home delivery of the
 Internet.  They can't deal with this, it is not in their realm of possibility
 for them to do it.  All they can do is be big and scare people.  You happen to
 be the people they want to scare, because you're the ones they are afraid of.
 They can't find you in one place to wipe you out.  They can't win this game
 and they know it."

 The ninety minute Jack and Phil Show did cover a wide range of topics.  Jack
 Rickard discussed how everyone wants on the Internet.  He joked that people
 will say "I want some Web and I want about seven pounds of it, I think.
 They're not even too sure what it is."  Phil Becker on the national on-line
 services, "Large commercial services win only by emulating what Sysops teach
 them how to do."

 The vendor exhibits were pretty much the standard fare.  From Internet service
 providers to the Giffy girls, most of the major players in the on-line world
 were there displaying their wares.  There was the traditional free stuff and
 give-a-ways, along with more sales pitches than a normal person would be
 exposed too in a lifetime.  But, there was plenty of interest, as vendors
 continue to time the release of new products with the BBSCON.

 The biggest surprise at the vendor exhibits was who was not there.  Without
 giving people any inclination of their plans, PCBoard was noticeably absent
 from the exhibit floor.  To this date, I remain bewildered by the decision of
 Clark Development Company (CDC), makers of the PCBoard BBS Software, to be a
 no-show.  Was it a non-issue, or was it the story of the convention?  I, along
 with other PCBoard Sysops, made the logical assumption that CDC would be a
 major player at the BBSCON.  After all, they had been at the last three
 conventions and CDC founder Fred Clark had served as a member of the Executive
 Advisory Board at previous events.  PCBoard had just won the Editor's Choice
 Award from PC-Magazine and how could anyone be so stupid as to miss this
 marketing opportunity?  There was speculation that because they were running
 their own "communications retreat" that they decided not to participate.
 There were "off-the-record" comments on what lead to the decision.  But, since
 Clark Development Company has not commented on their decision, it would be
 inappropriate for me to talk about it here.  Apparently, by their silence, CDC
 would prefer to keep the rumor mill cranking on that one.

 As I mentioned earlier, the decision to drive back home to Pasco County, or
 stay in Tampa for the night, was one I labored over.  When I got home Thursday
 night, I thought, hey, this is kind of nice.  Being able to check the board,
 sleep in your own bed and all that, seemed to make the decision to drive home
 worthwhile.  I had already had some fun, gotten to talk with a bunch of people
 and started to think we're only halfway through this thing.  It was sort of
 like having two BBSCONs to go to.  But, the next morning my perspective was a
 bit more realistic.  I got a taste of what the people who have to drive to
 work in Tampa go through every morning.  My advice to people attending
 conventions in their own home area, stay, stay overnight!  I cannot believe
 that some people drive down to Tampa five days a week.  I had not even left
 Pasco County before I was disgusted.  It really reinforced the idea of how
 lucky I am that I don't have to make that daily trek.  I guess you should not
 discard any of life's experiences, but having to make the morning drive to
 Tampa is one that I would not be too anxious to repeat.  However, when I drove
 down there on Sunday morning it was not nearly as unpleasant.

 There was one more thing I wanted to mention about the hotel.  They had a
 television station called VISITEL, which is a station with information about
 the area for visitors.  Since I live in the area, most of the programming
 offered little of interest.  But, one evening they were broadcasting BBSCON
 highlights.  There was an interview with Phil Becker, along with the entire
 Jack and Phil Show, playing on the hotel room TV.  Since they knew that the
 hotels were full of BBSCON attendees, I thought it was a very nice touch.

 With somewhere around 180 different educational sessions to choose from, there
 was something on just about every conceivable aspect of operating an on-line
 service.  One of the most popular educational sessions of the show has always
 been the BBS Success Roundtables.  The idea of putting a panel of successful
 Sysops together for a question and answer session is a sound concept.  The
 Sysops have always been willing to share their proven expertise.  In addition,
 these sessions have traditionally yielded some lighter moments.  Perhaps, the
 best line came from Greg Ryan of the Exec-PC BBS.  He was talking about how
 some services market the Internet.  "Everybody in this room has received at
 least ten AOL disks in the last year and some of us are using them as
 coasters."

 Some other sessions had their humorous moments as well.  A pretty good line
 came out of a session on Promoting Your Hobby Board.  A question from the
 floor asked about the naming of your bulletin board, and voiced the opinion on
 how Cyber-something was "getting a little worn out."  Alan Bechtold, editor of
 Sysop News and CyberWorld Report, joked "Yes, I think CyberXpo was the last
 qualified use of that."  Kathy Sussell of New York City's Invention Factory
 BBS has a delightful sense of humor.  She handles the marketing end of the
 husband and wife board, while husband Michael handles the technical end of
 things.  She put on a session titled How to Happily Run a BBS with Your
 Significant Other.  Kathy Sussell talked about answering technical questions
 on their voice support number.  "I'll tell people I'm not the techie, I just
 dropped by to answer the phone sometimes.  But, I'll get you the answer.  They
 will say 'I'm calling you on a Zoom modem,' and I'll say, 'well that's the
 problem.'"

 On Sunday, ONE BBSCON '95 drew to a close.  The BBSCON would reconvene in San
 Francisco on August 7-11, 1996.  As I drove back to Pasco County, my mind
 wandered.  It was a time to reflect on an amazing five days.  There are
 moments in life that stand out from the norm.  There are moments in life that
 make up for the day-to-day drudgery.  There are moments in life that have a
 special intensity.  Moments to reflect upon for all eternity.  Moments that
 recharge the soul.  Moments which you know will never be repeated.  August 16-
 20, 1995 was one of those moments in time.  ONE BBSCON '95 now belonged to the
 ages.

 ONE BBSCON '95 - What People Were Saying About Tampa Bay
 --------------------------------------------------------

 When a city hosts the ONE BBSCON, or any other major event for that matter,
 they are going to be the subject of some praise and criticisms.  When ONE
 BBSCON '95 was held at the Tampa Convention Center this past August, Tampa Bay
 was no exception to this rule.  Tampa's efforts to revitalize the downtown
 area have yet to lead to substantial results, as downtown Tampa remains a
 ghost town after the sun goes down.  This lead to comments that Tampa was a
 hick town where they rolled up the sidewalks at 6:00 pm.  People complained
 that there was no place to eat, that all the restaurants were closed and that
 there was nothing to do around town.  One of the first comments overheard
 about Tampa was a poor attempt at humor, but it did hit the nail on the head.
 "What do the locals do for excitement?  Leave town!"

 Not to indicate that all the feedback was on the negative side.  Many people
 were raving about how beautiful the area was and how wonderful the Tampa
 Convention Center was.  From Wednesday's night Welcoming Reception, until the
 event closed on Sunday, never was heard a discouraging word about the
 Convention Center itself.  There was also plenty of discussion about something
 completely out of the control of the local Chamber of Commerce, the heat.
 There was talk from the organizers of the event that the Tampa location was
 responsible for a leveling-off in the attendance for this year's show.  The
 editor of the Pasco BBS Magazine asked many in attendance what they thought
 about Tampa and some of the better quotes are the basis for this article.

 Phil Becker, one of the primary organizers of the ONE BBSCON, was asked what
 he thought of Tampa.  "I like Tampa quite a bit.  It's a bit warm.  I was here
 in February and it was little bit nicer then, I would say, then it is right
 now.  This facility, on the other hand, is why we're here.  It is the most
 gorgeous convention facility, I think, that is available anywhere.  It is
 really why we brought this show here to tell you the truth."  Jack Rickard,
 the other half of the ONE, Inc. team, also commented on Tampa.  "It's a little
 warmish.  It was beautiful in February.  The attraction is this facility, it's
 just ideal for this kind of a show.  We thought that it would be a real pretty
 show here and it is.  Actually, Florida and the Tampa area with this Tampa Bay
 On-Line and so forth, there are some pretty active people in the area on-line.
 I think it has worked out pretty well for us."

 Jack Rickard continued discussing the site of the Welcoming Reception, along
 with the strengths and weaknesses of holding the event in Tampa.  "I think
 that river-walk terrace was a delightful setting.  A little warm, but it was
 very scenic and that is what we look for in the Welcoming Reception.  Atlanta
 had some advantages and disadvantages, Tampa has too.  We try to go into a
 place and take advantage of the good stuff and minimize the losses on the
 things that don't work so well.  Tampa is a little light on hotels, they don't
 have a big hotel, they're a little bit scattered, so we try and focus it here
 on the Convention Center.  I did a hospitality last night with a boat tied up
 out here by the fountain.  Phil Becker did one where he brought in a boat and
 they went on a cruise.  We have kind of focused all the activities right here
 on the Convention Center, which is the strong card here in Tampa."

 With this year's event drawing only slightly more people than last year's show
 in Atlanta, organizers were asked if they felt there may have been a leveling-
 off in the attendance.  Phil Becker replied, "I think the truth is that Tampa
 is a little further away in people's minds, I think they're worried about the
 heat in August and I think it has had a damping effect on this year's
 attendance.  It looks like we'll be in the 5,000 range, I haven't seen what
 the local response will be.  We've had a lot of interest locally and that may
 change, we may get more local traffic than I expect.  If the local traffic is
 typical to what we've seen in past years we'll be in the 5,000 range."  Jack
 Rickard concurred, "It is kind of hard to get people from the rest of the
 country to come down here, but we do have attendees from thirty countries."

 What were others saying about the area?  There was some talk at Thursday
 morning's Welcoming Session.  Scott Brinker, President and CEO of Galacticomm,
 Inc. and a Fort Lauderdale resident, went up to the podium and commented,
 "Welcome to Tampa and the humidity!"  Jim Harrer, President of Mustang
 Software, Inc., began his opening remarks, "First of all I think we ought to
 give Jack and Phil a hand for, again, hosting this at such a beautiful
 facility like Tampa.  This is just gorgeous guys."  Shortly after the
 Welcoming Session, David McClure, the Executive Director of the Association of
 Online Professionals, put the warm temperatures in perspective.  "I love
 Tampa.  It's warmer than this in D.C., where I come from.  If you look at the
 map, it's all red.  If you are going to have to have the weather one way or
 another, Tampa is gorgeous, I love it."

 Kathy Sussell, who operates the Invention Factory BBS with her husband, was
 also asked 'how do you like Tampa?'  "I don't," the New York City resident
 replied.  "The area we're in is not really conducive to getting to know Tampa.
 Well, it's kind of hot, it's August.  See, at the convention we are really too
 busy to get out and see anything.  I mean, it looks like a nice city.  For me,
 I'm in the downtown area in the hotel and there is like no people walking
 around.  It is kind of quite at night and there are not many shops, it's hard
 to buy souvenirs."

 There was also some talk about the active hurricane season and about how
 Hurricane Erin had passed through the area just two weeks prior to the event.
 Phil Becker joked, "I was concerned about that.  When the hurricane came
 through, and I saw another one coming behind it, I said this will work out
 real good.  We'll get all these people in town and then kill them.  This will
 work."  Jack Rickard also quipped, "I was praying Hurricane Felix would come
 this way, kind of cool things down."

 So, that is some of what people had to say when the BBSCON came to our
 community.  This was one of the largest conventions to take place at the Tampa
 Convention Center this year and was the largest gathering of on-line
 enthusiasts in history.  A record which should stand until they reconvene the
 BBSCON in San Francisco next August.

 Windows 95:  The Hype Highway
 -----------------------------

 As expected, MicroSoft released the latest version of Windows on August 24.
 As people scurried to upgrade their computers to handle the massive operating
 system, the release of Windows 95 was expected to bring a billion dollar
 windfall to the computer industry.  As with any new software, the inevitable
 bugs and problems began surfacing shorting after the release.  While there are
 many interesting stories coming out of this new release, the hype surrounding
 Windows 95 made everything else pale by comparison.  MicroSoft proved to be
 the masters of marketing and lead millions of consumers down the hype highway.

 For months, MicroSoft had been heralding the much delayed release of Windows
 95 as a way to improve the quality of life for the average computer user, if
 not the average American.  This may have been the most hyped marketing
 campaign in history, even dwarfing the "new" Coke fiasco.  But, credit must be
 given, where credit is due, and MicroSoft launched one of the most effective
 advertising campaigns in history.  There certainly were some interesting
 stunts in their strategy.

 MicroSoft would not allow sales of Windows 95 until August 24, which lead
 computer stores worldwide to open their doors at midnight to begin selling the
 software.  Despite the fact that there no shortage of copies of Windows 95,
 some stores were going to the extent of taking reservations for the software.
 Many stores stayed open until the wee hours of the morning to handle the rush
 of customers.  Some of the stores carried a live broadcast of Bill Gates and
 MicroSoft had representatives in some stores to answer questions.  In New
 Zealand, where the midnight deadline came hours before stores in the United
 States could begin selling the software, Auckland business student Johnathan
 Prentice bought the first retail copy.  A Dallas computer store ran a "Best
 Dressed Computer Nerd" contest, but the whole midnight scenario left many with
 the thought that most computer geeks needed to get a life.

 But, the hype was the amazing thing.  MicroSoft paid to use the Rolling
 Stones' song "Start Me Up" for its advertising campaign.  Some in the media
 were reporting that the rights to the rock classic cost MicroSoft up to $12
 million, but the actual cost was somewhere between $2-4 million.  A hefty
 outlay, but only a small percentage of the $150 million advertising budget.
 MicroSoft president Bill Gates' face was all over the television.  He was on
 Larry King Live, the Today Show and featured in a paid half-hour advertisement
 in most of the major media markets.

 Some of the stunts were actually fairly original and clever.  In Great
 Britain, farm fields were painted with the Windows 95 logo.  In Sydney,
 Australia, a floating barge carrying a 40 foot re-creation of the software
 package was towed into the harbor.  In New York City, MicroSoft paid to light
 the 102-story Empire State Building in Windows 95 colors.  They brought out
 the entire run of "The Times of London" and distributed the paper free of
 charge, with some modifications to hype the release.  Tonight Show host Jay
 Leno hosted a corporate carnival in Seattle, which was beamed via satellite
 to 43 cities.

 A look behind the hype generated some gratifying numbers for MicroSoft.  They
 reportedly sold more than 300,000 copies in the United States on the first
 day, sold 1 million copies over first four days and expected to sell 29
 million copies by the end of the year.  A look behind the hype generated some
 unsatisfactory numbers for MicroSoft.  Within days of the release, the
 newspapers were full of Windows 95 horror stories of system crashes and the
 loss of critical data.  Their support line was overwhelmed with people seeking
 help.  Some spent hours on the phone, hours on hold for a long distance call
 which was not toll free.  MicroSoft had 1,600 people taking calls, which they
 felt could handle in excess of 20,000 calls a day, but they were woefully
 under-staffed.  Many times technicians could not answer questions and were
 giving the traditional answer to something they cannot explain, the old "virus
 or disk problem" response.  Another unsatisfactory number for MicroSoft, was
 the fact that their stock lost $4 on the Monday after the release.

 There will be millions of words written about the release of Windows 95.  An
 article could be written on how we ever got to a point where an operating
 system takes up 63 megabytes of disk space.  Articles have already been
 written on the claims that Windows 95 can be installed in less than an hour on
 a 386 with 4 meg of RAM.  But, the hype was the amazing thing.  Will MicroSoft
 try the same thing when they release their first bug fix release in November?

 Heretic: City of the Damned Review
 ----------------------------------

 Written by Paul Pollack, editor of GamePlay Magazine, New Port Richey, FL

 Another week, another 3D game.  I've run over pedestrians, blown away bombers,
 blasted a few imps, and now, with the release of Heretic, my dragon's claw is
 awfully worn.  It sometimes seems like this type of game pops up every week,
 with each new game getting less & less original along the way.  The first-
 person perspective has become over-used.  Yes, there's no such thing as a
 surplus of good titles, but many of the recent games are not good titles, far
 from it, in fact.

 That's why Heretic was such a relief.  It's an awfully creative idea, with the
 best 3D engine I've yet to see, and an original concept that sets a positive
 example for other game companies.  There are numerous magical artifacts
 scattered throughout the game, and the medieval feel only adds to the
 atmosphere.  Heretic is an incredible title.

 The Explanation:

 Graphics (A+):  With Heretic, the artists at Raven have forever redefined what
 3-D games should look like.  The wall, floor, and ceiling textures look
 fantastic, and fit in perfectly with the medieval setting, while the weapons
 all look realistically rendered.  The enemies you face are also very well-
 rendered, which leads me to believe that Heretic has the finest graphics ever
 to appear in a 3-D game.  There's a great attention to detail here.  The water
 seems to almost ripple, the graphics have a medieval touch that fits in
 perfectly with the concept, and everything stays in perspective while in
 flight.  Of course, Raven has always had great graphics in their titles
 (Shadowcaster speaks for itself), so it's not that much of a surprise that
 Heretic has raised the graphical stakes in the world of PC gaming.

 Sound (A):  Heretic makes great use of sound, from the splash present when
 your character hits the water to the sound of dead creatures collapsing to the
 floor.  Best of all, every single one of the sounds is realistic (or, in the
 case of the weapons, at least sounds right), and this adds greatly to the
 overall quality of the title.

 Music (B+):  There's not really that much to be said about this; the music in
 about all first-person shooters is pretty solid, and Heretic's certainly no
 exception.

 Plot (N/A):  Heretic's plot was ever more well-hidden than that of Apogee's
 Rise of the Triad.  In fact, I couldn't even find it, although I know that one
 does exist from the bits and pieces I've seen as well as the ending.  The
 plot, judging from what little I've seen, seems to be about on par with Doom,
 which isn't saying much.  Then again, nobody really cares about the plot in a
 game like this anyway, mainly because the plot isn't an integral part of the
 gameplay.

 Animation (A):  For Heretic, Raven used the Doom engine (which is fitting
 since id published the game), and the result in fantastic.  The scrolling and
 bobbing (on a fairly fast [486 DX2-50 with VLB recommended]) are every bit as
 realistic as Doom's, and the immersive quality of the title is simply
 fantastic.

 Puzzles (N/A):  The puzzles in Heretic were similar to those in Doom; find the
 keycard, unlock the door, find the switch, see what it does, etc.  And, like
 Doom, the puzzles mix in so well with the gameplay that it's impossible to
 give this a separate rating.

 Humor (N/A):  While there wasn't any humor in the game (unless you think the
 Doom codes backfiring is funny), it could only hurt the overall quality of
 the product.  With a medieval setting, humor would look out of place and
 detract from the overall experience.

 Funfactor (A+):  Heretic is a very fun game to play, since it manages to
 immerse you further into the game world than into other program I've seen;
 including id's Doom/Doom ][ and Apogee's Rise of the Triad.  It's obvious that
 a lot of work has been put into the game, and it really pays off in the end;
 wandering through the corridors and shooting enemies with your powered-up
 ethereal crossbow has never been so much fun!

 Re-play factor (B+):  Although it doesn't have nearly as many new PWAD files
 as does Doom, Heretic allows up to four players on an IPX-compatible network,
 and two players via a 9600 BPS+ modem (try a 14.4/28.8 for maximum
 performance).  Raven and id have also included DWANGO.EXE, a program that
 makes finding an opponent for your on-line sessions much easier.  And yes,
 Heretic does allow the player to run user-created WAD files (again, id has
 asked for users to create WAD's only for the registered version), so there may
 be a whole lot of them cropping up pretty soon.  But even without modem play,
 network play, or external WAD's, Heretic is a fun game that'll keep you coming
 back for more.  There's plenty in here for you to discover, and the game world
 is large and inviting.

 Control/Manipulation (B+):  To control Heretic, you can use either the
 keyboard, mouse, or joystick, and the game features special support for the
 Gravis PC GamePad, as well as a few other peripherals (like the Cyberman).
 While you'll probably enjoy playing with a combination of keyboard and mouse,
 I found that my Gravis PC GamePad worked the best out of everything I've
 tried.  The controls were smooth, the four buttons were easy to reach, and
 there were few times when I needed to resort to keyboard control.

 Technical factor (B+):  The game runs about as smoothly as Doom on many
 levels, and should perform nicely (although you may see some slowdown on some
 levels) on a 486 DX-33 with VLB/PCI.  As for bugs, I didn't encounter much
 trouble, although I have heard reports of it occasionally freezing up or
 dumping the user back to DOS.  These are just minor faults; they don't show up
 that often.

 Concept (A):  While the 3D shoot-em-up concept has been used ad nauseum, this
 is not a typical 3D shooter.  What strikes me as so original about Heretic is
 the fact that it features an inventory system, which goes a long way toward
 making it the best 3D game on the market.  What this system enables you to do
 is to carry certain items, called "artifacts."  Each artifact does a specific
 job; some are magical, and enhance your weapon power, or make you partially
 invisible, while others are normal artifacts, like a torch used for lighting
 the room.  You access the inventory system by using a combination of the
 bracket and enter keys (brackets to select, and enter to activate).

 One of the artifacts enables you to fly, but unlike ROTT, where you have to
 keep pressing the button to stay in the air, Heretic allows you to simply move
 your character up and he'll simply stay there: less realistic, but more
 convenient.  (ROTT v1.1 note: Rise of the Triad v1.1's flying method has
 changed, and now functions essentially the same as Heretic's.  This review was
 written before v1.1, and as such, some things may not be accurate.)

 The weapons are also a nice touch; your staff, elvenwand, ethereal crossbow,
 dragon's claw, and gauntlets of the necromancer are all pretty much what you'd
 expect to find in a game of this setting.  Yes, some type of sword would be
 nice, and our resident mythological expert Alex Thomas claims that
 necromancers don't wear metal (it's against their religion), but these are
 still solid additions to this already solid game.  As a Doom level designer
 (GLADIATOR, available on the BOT BBS -- get it today!), I noticed that Heretic
 also has many sector types, the most noticeable is the ability to set the
 winds (useful for simulating water currents).  And all the rest of the game
 just fits so well together that you can't help but love it.

 Raven and id have also opted to include an RSAC advisory-board rating with
 Heretic, and are among the first game publishers to use what may become `the'
 standard rating system.  When you first begin at the menu screen, in the lower
 left-hand corner, you'll see an RSAC advisory rating warning you of the level
 three (out of four) blood/gore content found in the game.  Although I doubt
 this rating will persuade someone not to play, it will help concerned parents
 decide whether the game is appropriate for their child.

 Bang for your Buck/Worth buying (A):  Both Raven & id Software are famous for
 putting out high quality programs, and with Heretic, it becomes apparent why
 they have such reputations.  Heretic makes full use of the Doom engine, but
 enhances it with so many neat touches (such as inventory management, the
 ability to fly, and unique artifacts), that it stands out as one of the best
 games, if not THE best game the genre has to offer.  Whether you buy it or not
 depends upon what you like.  If you are A) a Doom freak, B) a medieval times
 fan, or C) just someone looking for a great game (that's about all of us,
 isn't it?), you should check out Heretic.  Then again, if you don't like 3D
 shooters, Heretic probably won't convert you.  Your loss, though.

 Ending (D):  I found the ending of the shareware version of Heretic
 suspiciously similar to that of the shareware version of Doom.  Both consisted
 completely of text appearing on a background, explaining a brief ending, and
 then telling what to expect when you register the next episode.

 Well, what should you expect?  While on the subject of similarities between
 Doom and Heretic, let me point out that both titles use a similar approach
 when it comes to registration.  Both Doom and Heretic intentionally take out
 certain items to increase registration rates; for Doom it was the BFG 9000,
 Plasma Cannon, and the Berserk power-ups.  For Heretic, id and Raven have
 taken out the Hellstaff, Phoenix Rod, and other power-ups.

 Overall (A):  Heretic is one of those rare titles that not only tries to
 imitate the best, but to improve upon it.  While other attempts like this one
 have met with mixed results, Heretic ups the genre a notch higher and extends
 the Doom engine with its innovative inventory management.

 Although it may seem like a minor addition, I really feel that Heretic's
 inventory system could be the next big step forward in the genre, as
 publishers realize that it takes more than just good graphics and a smooth
 engine to keep people hooked.  Soon gamers will be demanding more, as the next
 batch of 3D games (like Quake & Dark Forces) are released.

 To be more immersive, there must be more realism, and only through
 improvements such as Heretic's inventory management will we ever get this.
 Gamers have been wishing for more realism for quite a while, and it's nice to
 know that game companies are finally listening to us.  Download a copy of
 Heretic off the Board of Trade BBS today.  You won't be sorry!

 The 904 telephone area code will be splitting on December 3 of this year to
 form a new 352 area code.  This change, which originally was expected to
 happen some time next year, will affect the Southern section of the current
 904 area code.  The part of Pasco County in the 904 area code, along with
 Citrus, Hernando, Lake, Levy, Marion, and Sumter counties, will have to switch
 to the new area code.  The areas north of that will be able to retain the
 current area code.  This is the latest in a series of area code splits taking
 place all over the country.  The increased usage in electronic equipment, such
 as pagers, modems and cellular phones, has created the demand for additional
 telephone number.

 Jack Flash Review
 -----------------

 Jack Flash and the Mutiny of the Things is a new game written by Christian
 Aschoff of Germany's CAPS Softwaredesign ULM and distributed by MVP Software.
 The first of Jack Flash's four worlds is being distributed via the Shareware
 market.  It is an enjoyable game with nice graphics and colorful enemies.

 The game scenario begins with a news broadcast by Norbert Nanotech.  It seems
 that Professor E. Eddison (known as Evil Eddi) has brought the "Things" to
 life with his "Energy Generators."  Now the battle begins with nowhere to hide
 from the aggressive apples, combative carrots, lunatic light-bulbs and all the
 other strange things the doctor has brought to life.  The hope for
 civilization lies with the one and only Jack Flash and his Suck-O-Matic.  As
 Jack Flash, you try to suck the life out of all the bad guys and save the
 universe in the process.

 With parallax-scrolling, decent sound card support and a sense of humor, Jack
 Flash Mutiny of the Things is a nice addition to MVP Software's catalog.

 PBM Flashback - October 1994
 ----------------------------

 The October 1994 issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine featured a report on ONE
 BBSCON '94 in Atlanta.  One of the highlights was the Sysops who were quoted
 during the BBS Success Roundtable educational sessions.  The sessions are
 quite informative, but the sessions are not without their lighter moments.
 Here is some of what Kathy Sussell of the Invention Factory BBS had to say
 about running a bulletin board in New York City.

 "We had a very big (line) noise problem.  The infrastructure of New York City
 is falling apart.  It is kind of hard to be a high tech company in a low tech
 town."

 Editor's Note:  PBM Flashback will appear on a regular basis in future issues.
 Most issues will have this brief look back at some of the features which have
 appeared over the history of the Pasco BBS Magazine.

 Corrections and Clarifications
 ------------------------------

 In last month's Catalog of Free On-Line Magazines, one magazine's home BBS had
 the incorrect telephone number.  The GamePlay Magazine's home BBS, the Board
 of Trade BBS, had the wrong number.  Since this is also the home BBS of the
 Pasco BBS Magazine, the correct number can be found several places in this
 issue, but it shows just how easy it is to get someone's number wrong.

 If you notice mistakes in the magazine, please let us know so the appropriate
 correction may be run.
