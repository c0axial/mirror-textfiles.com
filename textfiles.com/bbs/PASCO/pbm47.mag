 Editor's Welcome
 ----------------

 Thank you very much for checking out this month's Pasco BBS Magazine!

 When John Zagar send a short article called "Remembering Computers," we
 decided to make that the theme of this month's issue.  In one article, we have
 extracted some of our favorite recollections of the early days of computers
 from past issues of the magazine.  There is also a "Computer Time Line" which
 gives a history of the computer.  I want to thank John Zagar for sending in
 the inspiration for this issue.

 This month we also log into the home page for the White House on the World
 Wide Web and report on what was found at this very popular Internet site.
 There is also part two of Paul Pollack's article on Heretic level design and
 another installment of Computer Basics by Ed Garwood.  There was also an
 important court case dealing with the Communications Decency Act and we have
 reprinted some of the court papers explaining the Internet.  I think you will
 find it very interesting reading.  Of course, all our other regular features
 are back, including the latest news.

 Thanks for reading!

 Remembering Computers
 ---------------------

 Written by John Zagar, Hudson, FL

 Recently a group of my friends and I got into a discussion about our first
 introductions to computers.  I thought about my own experiences and saw how
 far the computer has advanced in the past few years.  It is surprising how few
 people appreciate the advances in technology the home computer offers.  Back
 in the early 70's Radio Shack sold the Model I computer with 64K of RAM, this
 didn't mean much to me because I had no idea what RAM was.  My 14 year old son
 and I had a new toy to play with.  After reading the manual and learning the
 BASIC Language we soon started to write simple programs and could store them
 on a cassette recorder.  This was a very slow process loading and saving
 programs, but it was still fun.

 A few years later Radio Shack offered their Model III with a 5 1/4 360K floppy
 drive.  We really thought we were Up-Town with this computer, transferring
 data was fast and easy.

 With the past experience writing BASIC programs I started to write Horse Race
 Handicapping Programs.  I could load my computer in the car and travel to
 different motels in the cities where the races were held, and purchase the
 Daily Racing Form and enter the information into the computer.  Soon my
 printer was printing out what it considered to be the winning horses.  My win
 percentage did increase slightly, besides I could now brag to my friends that
 it was a computer pick.

 Our next computer was an Epson QX-10.  This computer offered us more graphics
 and their Valdox word processor was very superior in those days.  We later
 added a MS-DOS board so that we could have CPM and IBM capabilities.  As
 prices dropped on the IBM Clones we bought our 286 16MHZ with 1 meg of RAM and
 a whopping 20MEG Hard Drive and 5 1/4 & 3 1/2 floppies.  We still could not
 afford color so we were content with the amber monitor, it was a change from
 the green screen and the old black & white days.  This was my first indication
 of how far the computer industry had advanced.  If you had a computer running
 at 8MHZ you would appreciate the 16MHZ speed.  With the new games and programs
 available we soon found a need for VGA, and a 2400 baud modem.  We now had at
 our fingertips files from the local BBSs and a chance to meet mew friends
 through the message bases on the BBS.

 I have upgraded my computer with a faster CPU more RAM and a larger hard
 drive, a faster modem and a sound card.  After seeing my own advances, I
 wonder how many computer users really know what they have at their finger
 tips.

 I don't run a BBS, so I don't know much about them other than logging on to
 their boards.  I would be lost without them.  I am now retired with a lot of
 time on my hands, it is a pleasure to log on to a board and download an
 interesting file, if I like it I register it.  I like the try before you buy
 concept.  Thanks to all the System Operators of BBSs, you are an asset to
 computer users, keep up the good work.  You help make owning a computer a
 pleasure.

 Editor's Note:  I want to thank John Zagar for sending in this article.  If
 you have any recollections from the early days of the personnel computer,
 please send them along.  We would be very happy to publish your thoughts in a
 future issue.

 Remembering Computers Part II:  Past Reflections
 ------------------------------------------------

 Continuing with the theme for this month's issue, we present some of our
 favorite recollections of the early days of computers.  Over the last three
 and one half years, the Pasco BBS Magazine has published many comments about
 the earliest days of this industry.  This article shares some of our favorite
 extractions from past issues.

 Popular game designer Nels Anderson talked about the pre-PC days in the very
 first issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine.  "I actually started programming way
 back in the dark ages of computers, well before personal computers were
 available.  I was just in high school at the time and they had a PDP-8/L which
 was hot stuff at the time (4K of memory, paper tape for I/O, and a Teletype).
 I learned a lot from it and naturally some of the stuff I did was games.  Very
 few game ideas are totally original and that's been the case with all my
 games.  EGATrek was inspired by the classic minicomputer game, one of the
 first computer games ever, that I've traced back at least as far as 1971.
 SuperFly is actually an updated version of another pre-PC era computer game.
 Where I worked we had a programmable computer terminal (the screen and
 keyboard you use when connected to a minicomputer) and this terminal could
 play exactly one game:  'Fly.'  The terminal did not support graphics, so the
 flies were just asterisks.  A very simple game, it was still very addictive
 and many lunch hours were spent moving the cursor around swatting asterisks.

 Other programmers have had interesting recollections as well.  Jetpack author
 Adam Pedersen in the June 1993 issue:  "I started programming on a Commodore
 64 I got for Christmas.  I actually started Jetpack on that, but I never got
 very far on it.  My parents would only let me use the computer for about an
 hour a day, they thought all I did was play."  Popular BBS utility author
 Brent Yandel in the August 1993 issue:  "Actually, I had been programming in
 BASIC on any kind of home computer that came down the pike since 1981,
 Commodore, Apple II, TI or whatever happen to be in the house."  Ted Parker,
 author of the Merlin Hurricane Tracking Tool, in the May 1995 issue:  "I think
 my first actual computer was a VIC-20."

 Some of the comments by Sysops on the birth of their boards were also
 enlightening.  Ward Christensen setup the very first BBS and discussed it at
 ONE BBSCON '93.  Some of his reflections were published in the October 1993
 issue.  "What sort of hardware environment was it born on?  Something that
 would make you wonder how could it run.  It was in fact a X-100.  It had 64K
 on it.  Dual floppy disks, a quarter of a Meg a piece, with the 8" single
 sided floppy of the day.  And, a Hayes MicroModem 100.  The software?  The
 program was written in 8080 assembler, somewhere in the tens of thousands of
 lines of code."

 In the March 1993 issue, Dan Linton talked of the birth of the Software
 Creations BBS.  "Software Creations started as an XT system with 2400 baud
 lines."  In the June 1993 issue Bob Mahoney talked about the birth of the
 Exec-PC BBS.  "I found myself with two IBM PCs, I had the largest collection
 already of Shareware and free Public Domain software for the PC, I had a 30
 megabyte hard drive, one of the biggest in the country for a PC and I had a
 (1200 baud) modem.  I started the bulletin board and it was a smash, hit,
 success."  In the June 1994 issue Richard Paquette talked about the early days
 of the Livewire BBS.  "I never even knew how to spell the word computer until
 about 1986.  A friend of mine bought a little Tandy, floppy driven.  Then I
 bought a Tandy with a little 20 Meg drive, a 300 baud modem and I started
 playing around and I self-taught myself how to program.  Once I learned that,
 I started to run a bulletin board as a hobby, and everything grew from there."
 In the February 1996 issue Mike Sussell talked about the early days of the
 Invention Factory BBS.  "I started on your basic PC with a ten meg hard drive.
 It was a $5,000 PC that I actually paid IBM for.  The modem, I think was $600
 from Hayes at the time, 300 baud."

 Pasco County Sysops have also shared some interesting recollections.  Pasco's
 first Sysop Ed Black in the April 1995 issue:  "I had a spare Apple II E with
 a pair of floppies sitting around, so I figured what the heck.  So, I started
 up Fast Eddie's BBS.  I ran a 128K, Apple II E, with two 128K Apple single
 sided single density floppy drives.  A Hayes 300 baud SmartModem and a rotary
 telephone line.  I mean, not rotary like you think of it.  No touch tone.  The
 biggest problem that I had was that my total storage on the system was 256K.
 Actually less than that, because the program to run the board was about 40K
 and that sat on one disk.  These Apple double disk drives, the dual disks,
 each disk stored 128K.  That was it.  It is like the stone age."  Rob Marlowe,
 Sysop of Pasco County's oldest BBS, in the February 1994 issue:  "Back in
 early 1985, two of my three younger brothers were running bulletin board
 systems.  Ron was running an Apple // system in Gainesville and Richard was
 running an IBM system in Winter Park.  We liked calling their systems and
 decided to give BBSing a shot.  The Inner Sanctum brought high speed (1200
 bps) communications and a hard disk for storage (a whopping 10 meg drive).
 All this running on a five slot IBM PC!"

 As the computer industry forges ahead, it is always interesting to reflect
 back on how it all began.  Sometimes it is hard to believe how far we have
 come in such a short period of time.

 Computer Time Line
 ------------------

 500 BC:  The first abacus is created using wire and beads.

 1642:  Famous French philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal invents a
 mechanical adding machine.

 1670:  German philosopher Wilhelm von Leibniz creates a calculator that could
 perform multiplication.

 1833:  English inventor and mathematician Charles Babbage, known as "the
 father of the computer," used a grant from the British government in an
 attempt to make a demonstration model of a "difference engine."  Colleagues
 thought the idea was ridiculous, but Babbage is generally credited with
 inventing the calculating machine.  However, small imperfections could throw
 the machine off and the government eventually withdrew its support.  Babbage
 conceived another model, the "Analytical Engine," which had several key
 features of modern computers.  The Countess of Lovelace, Augusta Ada Byron,
 daughter of English poet Lord Byron, worked with Babbage and is considered the
 world's first computer programmer.  She developed instructions for doing
 computations on the analytical engine and published a series of notes which
 eventually allowed others to do what Babbage himself could not.

 1880's:  After the 1880 United States census took seven and one half years to
 tabulate, the U.S. government held a competition to find a way to speed up the
 process.  American mechanical engineer and inventor Herman Hollerith's
 tabulating machine won the contest.  Hollerith's machine used electrical
 power compared to the mechanical power that Babbage's creation used.  An
 unofficial count of the 1890 census was generated in six weeks.

 1896:  Realizing the financial potential of his new machine, Herman Hollerith
 founded the Tabulating Machine Company.

 1924:  IBM was formed by the merger of the Tabulating Machine Company,
 International Time Recording Company of New York and Dayton Scale Company.
 Thomas John Watson, Sr. headed IBM from 1924 until his death in 1956.

 1930:  First large scale analog computer is built at the Massachusetts
 Institute of Technology.

 Late 1930's:  Dr. John V. Atanasoff, professor of physics at Iowa State
 University, along with an assistant Clifford Berry, created the first
 digital computer which worked electronically.  The electronic calculating
 device was designed to assist students in solving mathematical problems and
 was called ABC for the Atanasoff-Berry Computer.

 1944:  Mark I computer built by Harvard professor of mathematics Howard
 Hathaway Aiken.  Aiken had read the Countess of Lovelace's notes and decided
 that a modern analytical engine was feasible.  IBM gave him $1 million to
 create the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator, which was eight feet high
 and fifty-five feet long.

 1946:  The ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was
 demonstrated at the University of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia on February 14,
 1946.  ENIAC, the first all-electronic computer, covered 1,500 square feet,
 weighed 30 tons, contained 600 switches and 17,468 vacuum tubes, and cost
 $450,000.  Designed by American physicist and research engineer Dr. John
 Mauchley and American engineer John Presper Eckert Jr. to calculate artillery
 firing tables, the computer could calculate a trajectory in five minutes
 compared to forty hours with a desktop calculator.  The ENIAC could handle
 5,000 additions per second and proved the hydrogen bomb was physically
 possible.

 1947:  Dr. John Mauchley and J. Presper Eckert Jr. form their own company and
 begin work on UNIVAC, which was based on the ENIAC.

 1950:  UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer) is introduced as the first
 commercial computer.  The fifteen foot long UNIVAC correctly predicted that
 Dwight Eisenhower would defeat Adlai Stevenson in the 1952 election after
 analyzing about 5% of the vote.

 microprocessor and Microsoft's DOS operating system.  That first IBM PC had
 two floppy disk drives, a monochrome monitor and cost $3,200.  While IBM
 predicted modest sales, they had the top market share within eighteen months.
 IBM licensed the DOS operating system from Microsoft who then licensed DOS to
 others.  Microsoft reportedly paid $75,000 for the core code from a Seattle
 software developer.  Apple placed an ad in the trade press which read:
 "Welcome, IBM!  Seriously."  Apple thought that IBM's entry in the market
 would give the personal computer a more serious image.  Also in 1981, the
 Delphi on-line service was founded and Chuck Forsberg introduced the YModem
 protocol.  The V.21 modem standard was developed for 300 bps and Hayes

 Shareware Professionals is formed in April.  April 1987 also saw IBM introduce
 the PS/2 family of PCs, featuring a nonstandard architecture and the OS/2
 operating system.  IBM was attempting to take back control of the personal
 computer market, but sales were unimpressive and the strategy proved
 disastrous.  WordPerfect 4.2 is released and became the all-time most
 successful word processor.

 1988:  The Prodigy on-line service begins operation.

 1989:  A computer by the name of "Deep Thought" beat master chess player David

 13, 1992, the first ONE BBSCON was held at Denver's Stouffer Concourse Hotel.

 1993:  The Pasco BBS Magazine is introduced with the January 1993 issue.
 Microsoft introduces Windows NT as the operating system for corporate networks
 and power users.  Intel introduced the Pentium computer chip and IBM released
 OS/2 Warp.  The first 28,800 baud modems appeared using the V.FC standard.  In
 August 1993, id Software released the Shareware game Doom:  Evil Unleashed.

 1994:  The V.34 modem standard was developed for 28,800 baud modems.

 1995:  On August 20, 1995, the last ONE BBSCON closes at the Tampa Convention
 Center in Tampa, Florida.  Amid much hype, Microsoft released Windows 95 on
 August 24, 1995.

 1996:  The 50th anniversary of the ENIAC computer is celebrated at the
 University of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia.  Vice President Al Gore
 commemorated the anniversary by restarting the ENIAC for the first time in

 match between IBM super-computer Deep Blue and world chess champion Garry
 Kasparov.  On February 10, Deep Blue defeated Kasparov in the first match of
 the six match game series.  It was the first time a computer had beaten a
 grandmaster under strict tournament conditions.  On February 17, the series
 concludes with Kasparov winning three games, Deep Blue winning once and two
 games resulting in draws.

 Computer Basics
 ---------------

 Written by Ed Garwood, Hudson, FL

 Backing Up Files

 Computer owners are continually being warned to "back up" their files.  This,
 of course, is excellent advice, something like taking out insurance.  The only
 trouble is that many people do not know just what this means, and many more
 have not the faintest idea how to "back up".  This article, while not the
 ultimate word on the subject, will at least provide a little information on
 the subject.

 First of all, what does the term "back up" really mean.  Basically, it means
 to copy certain programs or files to another place, from which they can be
 recovered if the original programs/files are lost.  Something like hiding a
 spare key to your car under the bumper or with the gas cap.  You lose your
 key, you have a back-up one.  So it is with computer files.  The computer,
 wonderful machine that it is, is NOT perfect.  Next week, next month, next
 year, some time will come the day when you find one or more of your files are
 unobtainable.  Whether you accidently erased them, whether they somehow became
 corrupted, or whether your hard drive crashed, is of no material importance.
 The fact is that they are GONE!!!  If you were clever enough to have made
 back-up copies, you need only restore them to their rightful place, and you
 are back in business again.  If not, as Blondie and Dagwood have been told,
 "Tough Patootie."

 How, then, do you make back-ups?  Assume you have just bought a copy of
 Quicken Version 17.3a, which came on 4 3« inch HD disks.  Before you try to
 install this program, get 4 3«" blank HD disks.  Take the first Quicken disk
 and put it into your A drive (or B drive, as the case may be).  Type DISKCOPY
 A: A: and press <Enter>.  (If you're using the B drive, the command is
 DISKCOPY B: B:)  You'll be prompted to put the source disk into the drive
 (which you have just done).  The drive light will go on and the first disk of
 Quicken will be copied into a temporary memory.  Soon, you will be told to
 remove the disk and replace it with the target disk (this will be the first
 blank disk) and press <Enter>.  When that disk has been filled, you will be
 prompted to put the next source disk in the drive, and so on, until all four
 disks have been copied.  Put the original disks away in a safe place, and use
 the back-up disks you just made to install your program on the hard disk,
 according to the instructions in the manual.  You have just made back-up
 copies of your program disks.

 NOTE:  In the instance above, you can copy this way ONLY to a disk that is
 exactly the same as the source disk.  Other wise, you will get an error
 message that the disks are not compatible.

 Copying under WINDOWS.

 The procedures under Windows are somewhat different.  For instance, you will
 not see the term Diskcopy in Windows, although you can actually accomplish the
 same effect.  First, open your File Manager.  Assuming you will copy from A
 drive, click on the A (upper left corner of the window).  Now, to make a copy
 of your disk (Like DISKCOPY), click on the DISK heading, and then click on
 'Copy Disk'.  A new window will open, and you will see that the two boxes
 therein already are set for Drive A.  Click on OK and follow further prompts.

 The other type of "back up" comes later, when you have generated data files,
 and wish to save them.  No need to back-up the entire program, since you
 probably have already have copies of the program.

 In the versions of DOS, up to and including Version 5.0, DOS had a very good
 back up program as a part of DOS, with which to back up files.  Version 6.0
 and Windows 3.1 came up with new backup programs, called MSBACKUP and MWBACKUP
 respectively.  Backing up with these new files is somewhat involved, and you
 should read the appropriate manual.

 Now, let us assume that you have been using WordPerfect for your
 correspondence.  You have written quite a bit, and you would like to back up
 those files, to save them in a safe place.  We'll also assume that you saved
 all of your correspondence with the .WPM extension, and that it is in the
 Files subdirectory of WordPerfect (i.e. WP\FILES).  There are a couple of ways
 to make your back-ups.  If you want to save the correspondence files to a
 single disk, (on the A Drive) , put a formatted disk in the A drive, go to the
 A prompt, and type XCOPY c:\WP\files\*.WPM a: and press <Enter>.  What we have
 done here is tell the computer 'Copy all of the files in the Files
 subdirectory of WordPerfect, which have the extension .WPM, and put them on
 the disk in the A drive'.  But, suppose you have so many files that one disk
 wouldn't hold them all.  Here's what you do.  First, at the A prompt, type the
 following:  Attrib +A c:\WP\files\*.WPM and press <Enter>.  NOTE: This gives
 the 'archive' attribute to all of those files.  Then, type XCOPY
 c:\WP\files\*.WPM a: /m and press <Enter>.

 The drive will start copying files, and when the disk is full, it will display
 the message "Insufficient Disk Space" and state how many files were copied.
 At this point, remove the first disk, and replace it with a second disk.
 Press the F3 key, and then press <Enter>.  The drive will resume the copying.
 Continue this until all of those files have been copied.  You have now backed-
 up your correspondence files.  If you wish to copy them back later on, put the
 disk in the A: drive and just type:  XCOPY A:\*.* c:\WP\files and press
 <enter>.  Continue until all files have been transferred.

 If you have the BACKUP.EXE file in DOS, you need only type, at the C: prompt,
 BACKUP C:\WP\FILES\*.WPM A: press <Enter>, and follow the prompts.  Note that
 if you use more than one floppy disk, they are numbered consecutively.  To
 restore the files later, put the #1 disk in the A drive, and type RESTORE
 A:*.* c:\WP\FILES.  NOTE: You MUST Restore files which were backed up using
 BACKUP to they directory from which they were copied.

 Should you just want to back up one or two files, the COPY command will work
 well.  The syntax is COPY C:\WP\FILES\filename.WPM A:.  The same type command
 can be used to restore the files to their original place.

 There are some commercial programs which will do the back-up job.  Among them
 are Norton BackUp, PC Tools, and a shareware program called BAC.  To use the
 latter, type BAC C:\WP\Files\*.WPM a:.  To restore them later, use the XCOPY
 command as above.  There are also tape units, which allow you to back up your
 files on tape, rather than floppy disks.  You can put about 100 MB of data on
 a tape unit.

 You obviously have so much on your mind that there isn't room left for any
 brains.  Some people are "has-beens," you're a "never-was."  Whatever is
 eating you must be suffering horribly.  Some day you'll find yourself - and be
 truly disgusted.

 Your attempts at humor are greeted by tremendous bursts of silence, and if you

 You are truly pathetic.  Not to be confused with imitation pathetic or

 PBM Flashback - July 1994
 -------------------------

 In the July 1994 issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine, Rob Kittredge was
 interviewed for an article on his new program QFront.  The program was
 designed to give PCBoard Sysops an easy way to get FidoNet up on their system.
 QFront was quite successful and had been named one of the favorite add-ons for
 PCBoard.  A version for Wildcat! would come out later.  Here is some of what
 Rob Kittredge said in that issue two years ago.

 "All I wanted to do was fill a gap that PCBoard had when interfacing with
 Fido, there is no other FidoNet mailer compatible with PCBoard like QFront is.
 That was one of my major goals, along with ease of set-up and ease of use for
 the average user.  QFront has better context sensitive help, as every item has
 a help display on the bottom of the screen.  As you move through each field it
 tells you, briefly with a one line description, what you are doing.  You can
 press F1 to get a more detailed help display for the field you are editing."

 Editor's Note:  PBM Flashback will appear on a regular basis in future issues.
 Each issue will have this brief look back at some of the features which have
 appeared over the history of the Pasco BBS Magazine.

 When You Just Can't Wait:  A Guide to Shareware Heretic Level Design (Part II)
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 "A not-so-quick, but still dirty, guide to shareware Heretic level design."

 Written by Paul Pollack, New Port Richey, Florida

 DISCLAIMER:  I cannot be held responsible for the prohibited distribution of
 levels for the Shareware version.  Please respect id's wishes and only use
 this while waiting for your registered version to arrive.  Do not distribute
 levels compatible with the Shareware version, as this is prohibited by id.

 Miscellaneous Items

 A. Using Heretic texture names/what they look like

 Another option (and one perhaps better than simply using Doom only textures;
 especially in Doom ][) when designing a level is to use Heretic texture names;
 DM2CONV doesn't touch 'em, and if you know what they look like (and your
 editor allows you to use their names), you can pretty much get the desired
 results.  But how do you know what the texture names are in Heretic?  Just
 download the last issue of GamePlay Magazine from the Board of Trade BBS for a
 list of textures found in the shareware version of Heretic from DeuTex.

 Of course, this doesn't really give you that good of an idea of what the
 textures actually look like; besides, this only covers the actual wall
 textures.  So what's a shareware PWAD editor to do?

 Originally I was planning to include a series of high resolution SVGA 640x480
 GIF files, created with the Graphic Workshop for DOS, containing a catalog of
 the available floor textures and wall patches.  But after thinking this over,
 I realized that I had serious questions about the legality of such a move, and
 so I'll detail how to create them yourself:

 First off, you'll need DeuTex v3.1, by Olivier Montanuy and docs by HevKev
 (Kevin McGrail).  Then use the

 DeuTex -FLATS -PATCHES -DOOM d:\heretic -XTRACT d:\heretic\heretic1.wad

 command to extract the floor, ceiling, and wall patches to their respective
 directories.  Then do what you want with them; I recommend cataloging them
 using a program like the Graphic Workshop, but you may find it more useful to
 do something else with them.

 B. Texture conversion chart (from DM2CONV source code)

 When you use Doom textures for your level, as you'll probably do unless you
 opt to use the list of Heretic textures above, it's pretty obvious that they
 need to be converted.  It's also pretty obvious (I told you above) that
 DM2CONV with the /TEXTURE parameter is just the program that does it.  But
 this brings up a question; if you use Doom textures, how are you to know what
 DM2CONV will replace them with when it converts them to Heretic.  It would be
 nice if there was some kind of chart; well, there is, thanks to the DM2CONV
 source code included with the software.

 Helpful hint:  This isn't really an insider secret or anything, just common
 sense.  A helpful approach in any problem is to try and work backwards.  After
 seeing what the Heretic textures look like, you may have some textures already
 picked out for your Heretic level; but since most of us can't put them in
 directly, it's best to put in the Doom name that corresponds to the Heretic
 wall.  This way, when DM2CONV encounters the texture, it will be converted to
 its Heretic equivalent; exactly the effect you wanted.

 Most Doom level designers (based on the PWAD's I've seen) use DEU v5.21 or a
 variant (like DDT, DeeP, etc.), and none of these (to the best of my
 knowledge) let you insert a texture not found in the IWAD.  The solution to
 this (like letting you call a texture a Heretic name or a Doom I name if you
 have Doom ][) is to change the default textures, which all the DEU variants
 are pretty much forced to accept.  Most of the time the textures are found in
 the INI file of editor (DEU.INI, DDT.INI, etc.), which are in standard text
 form, but in some cases (like HeeP and DeeP), this information is stored in a
 different format, which has the extension CFG.  If it's an INI file, you can
 pretty much just invoke the DOS editor (if you have DOS 5 or above) and change
 the default texture names to either a Doom name or a Heretic name (see
 Appendix A for a list of wall textures).  With a CFG file it's pretty much the
 same procedure, except for the fact that you can't use a standard DOS/ASCII
 editor.  My tool of choice is DISKEDIT, which comes with the Norton Utilities.
 I locate the appropriate texture name and overwrite it with the texture name
 that I want it to be from Doom or Heretic.  Usually, I change the default
 texture name to something with the same amount of letters beforehand; just to
 be sure I don't mess up the spacing when inserting characters.

 C. WAD directory/Miscellaneous information

 The PWAD directory structure for Heretic is also listed in the last GamePlay
 Magazine.  While most of the Heretic textures match up 1:1 with Doom textures,
 some of them, like TMBSTON1 and CHAINMAN, are impossible to get without
 putting them in manually.  For example, when I created a tombstone in my
 level, I could use one of the STEP? textures to get TMBSTON2 all over it, but
 then the tombstone lacked any writing.  So I used the nice little procedure
 described in Appendix B; I edited the DEEP.CFG file with DISKEDIT and
 proceeded to change the default lower texture to TMBSTON1.  After that, I
 cleared the previous lower texture, so the editor noticed that mine was
 absent.  I ran the level through the missing texture check, and sure enough,
 the program put in TMBSTON1 for the missing texture, just as I had planned.

 Of course, there's an alternative to having to insert the textures manually.
 If you have DEU2C by the Un-Naturals (ADMiRAL and SONiC), or the Doom
 Developers Toolkit, you can perform a nifty little trick, which will let you
 insert wall textures (but not floor/ceiling textures) into your Heretic PWAD
 quickly and easily.  First of all, you'll need a copy of DM2CONV v1.6, which
 comes with a nifty little tool called DMT.  What DMT can do is convert an IWAD
 to a PWAD and back, and it's this ability that comes into play in this
 discussion.  For a moment, I'll assume you're using the Doom Developers
 Toolkit.  Here's the trick:

 You'll want both your editor, DDT, and DMT to be in the same sub-directory, so
 you can make a batch file to change the main Heretic PWAD to an IWAD.  In the
 DDT.INI, you should have DOOM2.WAD as your main WAD file.  Under that, change
 the PWAD's you want to auto-load to include HERETIC1.WAD (being careful to
 specify the correct path).  Now you'll want to make a batch file using DMT to
 convert the Heretic WAD to a PWAD, then running DDT, and then converting it
 back when you're finished.  I called my batch file HDDT.BAT. Here's how it
 goes:

 @ECHO OFF
 DMT -OPEN D:\HERETIC\HERETIC1.WAD -IWAD D:\HERETIC\HERETIC1.WAD
 DDT
 DMT -OPEN D:\HERETIC\HERETIC1.WAD -IWAD D:\HERETIC\HERETIC1.WAD

 After doing this (and changing the appropriate file paths), and running the
 batch file, you should see a list of things DDT is "adding."  After a few
 years, when the list is finally complete, type R wadfile, where wadfile is the
 name of your PWAD.  For example, if I wanted to load MINE.WAD, I would type R
 MINE.WAD.  Then type E 1 to edit the first level, and you'll notice that the
 palette is all screwed up.  Disregard that for a second, and enter linedef
 mode.  Select a line, try changing the textures, and you'll realize that the
 texture list is now that of Heretic, not Doom/Doom ][.  You can simply select
 textures for each of your linedefs by using this method.  You'll notice that
 this technique doesn't work with floors and ceilings (sigh).

 There are a few textures which you'll probably want to put in either manually,
 or using the technique described above, since no Doom textures will be
 remapped to them when run through DM2CONV.  Besides the forementioned CHAINMAN
 (a 256x128 texture with a man in it), you'll also notice that DMNMSK (a gray
 door with symbols) is also absent, along with STNGLS1 (a nice, multi-colored,
 stained glass window).  This list is not exhaustive; I'm sure there are many
 more that can be found simply by comparing the lists in Appendices A and B.

 General use tips (for beginners):

 #1. Remember that on the sides of your door sectors, the two non-door lines
 (the "door jamb" lines) should carry the IM (impassible) and Lower unpegged
 flags.  What this does is to ensure that the lines don't move when the door
 does.  A better summary can be found by downloading Scott Amspoker's terriffic
 work on managing textures and the unpegged attribute.

 #2. Extract the wall and floor/ceiling textures using DeuTex as described in
 Appendix A.  Then catalog them and use the resulting files to make sure that
 the textures you use go together.  Also useful for making sure textures go
 together is the other miscellaneous information in Appendix A; usually, if
 textures use about the same patches, they'll go pretty well together.

 #3. Use the original Heretic as a model, for deciding what textures look good
 where.  There are some pretty neat textures, and combinations, present in the
 levels, and using them as guidelines can help give your level a boost.

 #4. Don't be afraid to download some tutorials for beginners, especially if
 they deal with your particular editor (or a variant).  I'm not afraid to admit
 that I downloaded a couple when I was creating my first PWAD, and they can
 contain some useful information that you otherwise might not know.  I
 recommend the Beginner's Guide to DEU and the Doom Level Design FAQ, version
 1.2 or later.

 One last tip:  If you plan out your levels on paper, and I'm sure at least a
 few of you do, you'd be well off using HeeP version 6.13 by Sensor Based
 Systems.  After it detects you have the shareware version, it won't let you
 save, but since it contains all the Heretic shareware version
 textures/linedefs/etc. (as well as a rather intuitive texture viewer), you
 will be able to get a good idea of what the finished product will look like.
 Just copy down what textures (as well as things, linedef types, etc.) look
 good where on a piece of scrap paper (or your plan sheet) and input them later
 with your regular Doom-based editor.

 Yeah, and just a reminder:  ID has not authorized, in fact, rather the
 opposite, any distribution of levels compatible with the shareware versions
 of their games!  This is intended only for use while waiting for your
 registered version to arrive.  And then, once your registered version does
 arrive, you can port your levels over to an editor that works with the
 registered version of Heretic.  If you would like to work fully with Heretic
 levels (and use all the new things/textures), you need to register your
 version.

 Case Against the CDA Provides a History of the Internet
 -------------------------------------------------------

 On June 11, 1996, the results of a three member judicial panel review of a
 civil action filed against the government and the Communications Decency Act
 were released.  The case was heard in the United States District Court for the
 Eastern District of Pennsylvania before judges Dolores K. Sloviter, Ronald L.
 Buckwalter and Stewart Dalzell.  The court papers summarized the case:

 "Before us are motions for a preliminary injunction filed by plaintiffs who
 challenge on constitutional grounds provisions of the Communications Decency
 Act of 1996, which constitutes Title V of the Telecommunications Act of 1996,
 signed into law by the President on February 8, 1996.  Plaintiffs include
 various organizations and individuals who, inter alia, are associated with the
 computer and/or communications industries, or who publish or post materials on
 the Internet, or belong to various citizen groups."

 "The defendants in these actions are Janet Reno, the Attorney General of the
 United States, and the United States Department of Justice.  Plaintiffs
 contend that the two challenged provisions of the CDA that are directed to
 communications over the Internet which might be deemed "indecent" or "patently
 offensive" for minors, defined as persons under the age of eighteen, infringe
 upon rights protected by the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the
 Fifth Amendment."

 The primary defendants, among numerous others, were the American Civil
 Liberties Union and the American Libraries Association, Inc.  The court ruled
 that the government could not control the Internet and that access was better
 left in the hands of parents rather than the government.  The plaintiffs were
 expected to appeal.

 The court order read in part:  "And now, this 11th day of June, 1996, upon
 consideration of plaintiffs' motions for preliminary injunction, and the
 memoranda of the parties and amici curiae in support and opposition thereto,
 and after hearing, and upon the findings of fact and conclusions of law set
 forth in the accompanying Adjudication, it is hereby ORDERED that:  1. The
 motions are GRANTED; 2. Defendant Attorney General Janet Reno, and all acting
 under her direction and control, are PRELIMINARILY ENJOINED from enforcing,
 prosecuting, investigating or reviewing any matter premised upon: (a)
 Sections 223(a)(1)(B) and 223(a)(2) of the Communications Decency Act of 1996
 ("the CDA"), to the extent such enforcement, prosecution, investigation, or
 review are based upon allegations other than obscenity or child pornography;
 and (b) Sections 223(d)(1) and 223(d)(2) of the CDA; 3. Pursuant to Fed. R.
 Civ. P. 65(c), plaintiffs need not post a bond for this injunction; and 4. The
 parties shall advise the Court, in writing, as to their views regarding the
 need for further proceedings on the later of (a) thirty days from the date of
 this Order, or (b) ten days after final appellate review of this Order."

 Before the above order was issued, the judges were given background and
 historical information about the Internet.  The rest of this article is an
 extraction from the court papers explaining the Internet.

 1.  The Internet is not a physical or tangible entity, but rather a giant
 network which interconnects innumerable smaller groups of linked computer
 networks.  It is thus a network of networks.  This is best understood if one
 considers what a linked group of computers -- referred to here as a "network"
 -- is, and what it does.  Small networks are now ubiquitous (and are often
 called "local area networks").  For example, in many United States
 Courthouses, computers are linked to each other for the purpose of exchanging
 files and messages (and to share equipment such as printers).  These are
 networks.

 2.  Some networks are "closed" networks, not linked to other computers or
 networks.  Many networks, however, are connected to other networks, which are
 in turn connected to other networks in a manner which permits each computer in
 any network to communicate with computers on any other network in the system.
 This global Web of linked networks and computers is referred to as the
 Internet.

 3.  The nature of the Internet is such that it is very difficult, if not
 impossible, to determine its size at a given moment.  It is indisputable,
 however, that the Internet has experienced extraordinary growth in recent
 years.  In 1981, fewer than 300 computers were linked to the Internet, and by
 1989, the number stood at fewer than 90,000 computers.  By 1993, over
 1,000,000 computers were linked.  Today, over 9,400,000 host computers
 worldwide, of which approximately 60 percent located within the United States,
 are estimated to be linked to the Internet.  This count does not include the
 personal computers people use to access the Internet using modems.  In all,
 reasonable estimates are that as many as 40 million people around the world
 can and do access the enormously flexible communication Internet medium.  That
 figure is expected to grow to 200 million Internet users by the year 1999.

 4.  Some of the computers and computer networks that make up the Internet are
 owned by governmental and public institutions, some are owned by non-profit
 organizations, and some are privately owned.  The resulting whole is a
 decentralized, global medium of communications -- or "cyberspace" -- that
 links people, institutions, corporations, and governments around the world.
 The Internet is an international system.  This communications medium allows
 any of the literally tens of millions of people with access to the Internet to
 exchange information.  These communications can occur almost instantaneously,
 and can be directed either to specific individuals, to a broader group of
 people interested in a particular subject, or to the world as a whole.

 5.  The Internet had its origins in 1969 as an experimental project of the
 Advanced Research Project Agency ("ARPA"), and was called ARPANET.  This
 network linked computers and computer networks owned by the military, defense
 contractors, and university laboratories conducting defense-related research.
 The network later allowed researchers across the country to access directly
 and to use extremely powerful supercomputers located at a few key universities
 and laboratories.  As it evolved far beyond its research origins in the United
 States to encompass universities, corporations, and people around the world,
 the ARPANET came to be called the "DARPA Internet," and finally just the
 "Internet."

 6.  From its inception, the network was designed to be a decentralized, self-
 maintaining series of redundant links between computers and computer networks,
 capable of rapidly transmitting communications without direct human
 involvement or control, and with the automatic ability to re-route
 communications if one or more individual links were damaged or otherwise
 unavailable.  Among other goals, this redundant system of linked computers was
 designed to allow vital research and communications to continue even if
 portions of the network were damaged, say, in a war.

 7.  To achieve this resilient nationwide (and ultimately global)
 communications medium, the ARPANET encouraged the creation of multiple links
 to and from each computer (or computer network) on the network.  Thus, a
 computer located in Washington, D.C., might be linked (usually using dedicated
 telephone lines) to other computers in neighboring states or on the Eastern
 seaboard.  Each of those computers could in turn be linked to other computers,
 which themselves would be linked to other computers.

 8.  A communication sent over this redundant series of linked computers could
 travel any of a number of routes to its destination.  Thus, a message sent
 from a computer in Washington, D.C., to a computer in Palo Alto, California,
 might first be sent to a computer in Philadelphia, and then be forwarded to a
 computer in Pittsburgh, and then to Chicago, Denver, and Salt Lake City,
 before finally reaching Palo Alto.  If the message could not travel along that
 path (because of military attack, simple technical malfunction, or other
 reason), the message would automatically (without human intervention or even
 knowledge) be re-routed, perhaps, from Washington, D.C. to Richmond, and then
 to Atlanta, New Orleans, Dallas, Albuquerque, Los Angeles, and finally to Palo
 Alto.  This type of transmission, and re-routing, would likely occur in a
 matter of seconds.

 9.   Messages between computers on the Internet do not necessarily travel
 entirely along the same path.  The Internet uses "packet switching"
 communication protocols that allow individual messages to be subdivided into
 smaller "packets" that are then sent independently to the destination, and are
 then automatically reassembled by the receiving computer.  While all packets
 of a given message often travel along the same path to the destination, if
 computers along the route become overloaded, then packets can be re-routed to
 less loaded computers.

 10.  At the same time that ARPANET was maturing (it subsequently ceased to
 exist), similar networks developed to link universities, research facilities,
 businesses, and individuals around the world.  These other formal or loose
 networks included BITNET, CSNET, FIDONET, and USENET.  Eventually, each of
 these networks (many of which overlapped) were themselves linked together,
 allowing users of any computers linked to any one of the networks to transmit
 communications to users of computers on other networks.  It is this series of
 linked networks (themselves linking computers and computer networks) that is
 today commonly known as the Internet.

 11.  No single entity -- academic, corporate, governmental, or non-profit --
 administers the Internet.  It exists and functions as a result of the fact
 that hundreds of thousands of separate operators of computers and computer
 networks independently decided to use common data transfer protocols to
 exchange communications and information with other computers (which in turn
 exchange communications and information with still other computers).  There is
 no centralized storage location, control point, or communications channel for
 the Internet, and it would not be technically feasible for a single entity to
 control all of the information conveyed on the Internet.

 12.  Individuals have a wide variety of avenues to access cyberspace in
 general, and the Internet in particular.  In terms of physical access, there
 are two common methods to establish an actual link to the Internet.  First,
 one can use a computer or computer terminal that is directly (and usually
 permanently) connected to a computer network that is itself directly or
 indirectly connected to the Internet.  Second, one can use a "personal
 computer" with a "modem" to connect over a telephone line to a larger computer
 or computer network that is itself directly or indirectly connected to the
 Internet.  As detailed below, both direct and modem connections are made
 available to people by a wide variety of academic, governmental, or commercial
 entities.

 13.  Students, faculty, researchers, and others affiliated with the vast
 majority of colleges and universities in the United States can access the
 Internet through their educational institutions.  Such access is often via
 direct connection using computers located in campus libraries, offices, or
 computer centers, or may be through telephone access using a modem from a
 student's or professor's campus or off-campus location.  Some colleges and
 universities install "ports" or outlets for direct network connections in each
 dormitory room or provide access via computers located in common areas in
 dormitories.  Such access enables students and professors to use information
 and content provided by the college or university itself, and to use the vast
 amount of research resources and other information available on the Internet
 worldwide.

 14.  Similarly, Internet resources and access are sufficiently important to
 many corporations and other employers that those employers link their office
 computer networks to the Internet and provide employees with direct or modem
 access to the office network (and thus to the Internet).  Such access might be
 used by, for example, a corporation involved in scientific or medical research
 or manufacturing to enable corporate employees to exchange information and
 ideas with academic researchers in their fields.

 15.  Those who lack access to the Internet through their schools or employers
 still have a variety of ways they can access the Internet.  Many communities
 across the country have established "free-nets" or community networks to
 provide their citizens with a local link to the Internet (and to provide
 local-oriented content and discussion groups).  The first such community
 network, the Cleveland Free-Net Community Computer System, was established in
 1986, and free-nets now exist in scores of communities as diverse as Richmond,
 Virginia, Tallahassee, Florida, Seattle, Washington, and San Diego,
 California.  Individuals typically can access free-nets at little or no cost
 via modem connection or by using computers available in community buildings.
 Free-nets are often operated by a local library, educational institution, or
 non-profit community group.

 16.  Individuals can also access the Internet through many local libraries.
 Libraries often offer patrons use of computers that are linked to the
 Internet.  In addition, some libraries offer telephone modem access to the
 libraries' computers, which are themselves connected to the Internet.
 Increasingly, patrons now use library services and resources without ever
 physically entering the library itself.  Libraries typically provide such
 direct or modem access at no cost to the individual user.

 17.  Individuals can also access the Internet by patronizing an increasing
 number of storefront "computer coffee shops," where customers -- while they
 drink their coffee -- can use computers provided by the shop to access the
 Internet.  Such Internet access is typically provided by the shop for a small
 hourly fee.

 18.  Individuals can also access the Internet through commercial and non-
 commercial "Internet service providers" that typically offer modem telephone
 access to a computer or computer network linked to the Internet.  Many such
 providers -- including the members of plaintiff Commercial Internet Exchange
 Association -- are commercial entities offering Internet access for a monthly
 or hourly fee.  Some Internet service providers, however, are non-profit
 organizations that offer free or very low cost access to the Internet.  For
 example, the International Internet Association offers free modem access to
 the Internet upon request.  Also, a number of trade or other non-profit
 associations offer Internet access as a service to members.

 19.  Another common way for individuals to access the Internet is through one
 of the major national commercial "online services" such as America Online,
 CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, or Prodigy.  These online services offer
 nationwide computer networks (so that subscribers can dial-in to a local
 telephone number), and the services provide extensive and well organized
 content within their own proprietary computer networks.  In addition to
 allowing access to the extensive content available within each online service,
 the services also allow subscribers to link to the much larger resources of
 the Internet.  Full access to the online service (including access to the
 Internet) can be obtained for modest monthly or hourly fees.  The major
 commercial online services have almost twelve million individual subscribers
 across the United States.

 20.  In addition to using the national commercial online services, individuals
 can also access the Internet using some (but not all) of the thousands of
 local dial-in computer services, often called "bulletin board systems" or
 "BBSs."  With an investment of as little as $2,000.00 and the cost of a
 telephone line, individuals, non-profit organizations, advocacy groups, and
 businesses can offer their own dial-in computer "bulletin board" service where
 friends, members, subscribers, or customers can exchange ideas and
 information.  BBSs range from single computers with only one telephone line
 into the computer (allowing only one user at a time), to single computers with
 many telephone lines into the computer (allowing multiple simultaneous users),
 to multiple linked computers each servicing multiple dial-in telephone lines
 (allowing multiple simultaneous users).  Some (but not all) of these BBS
 systems offer direct or indirect links to the Internet.  Some BBS systems
 charge users a nominal fee for access, while many others are free to the
 individual users.

 21.  Although commercial access to the Internet is growing rapidly, many users
 of the Internet -- such as college students and staff -- do not individually
 pay for access (except to the extent, for example, that the cost of computer
 services is a component of college tuition).  These and other Internet users
 can access the Internet without paying for such access with a credit card or
 other form of payment.

 22.  Once one has access to the Internet, there are a wide variety of
 different methods of communication and information exchange over the network.
 These many methods of communication and information retrieval are constantly
 evolving and are therefore difficult to categorize concisely.  The most common
 methods of communications on the Internet (as well as within the major online
 services) can be roughly grouped into six categories:  (1) one-to-one
 messaging (such as "e-mail"), (2) one-to-many messaging (such as "listserv"),
 (3) distributed message databases (such as "USENET newsgroups"), (4) real time
 communication (such as "Internet Relay Chat"), (5) real time remote computer
 utilization (such as "telnet"), and (6) remote information retrieval (such as
 "ftp," "gopher," and the "World Wide Web").  Most of these methods of
 communication can be used to transmit text, data, computer programs, sound,
 visual images (i.e., pictures), and moving video images.

 23.  One-to-one messaging.  One method of communication on the Internet is via
 electronic mail, or "e-mail," comparable in principle to sending a first class
 letter.  One can address and transmit a message to one or more other people.
 E-mail on the Internet is not routed through a central control point, and can
 take many and varying paths to the recipients.  Unlike postal mail, simple e-
 mail generally is not "sealed" or secure, and can be accessed or viewed on
 intermediate computers between the sender and recipient (unless the message is
 encrypted).

 24.  One-to-many messaging.  The Internet also contains automatic mailing list
 services (such as "listservs"), [also referred to by witnesses as "mail
 exploders"] that allow communications about particular subjects of interest to
 a group of people.  For example, people can subscribe to a "listserv" mailing
 list on a particular topic of interest to them.  The subscriber can submit
 messages on the topic to the listserv that are forwarded (via e-mail), either
 automatically or through a human moderator overseeing the listserv, to anyone
 who has subscribed to the mailing list.  A recipient of such a message can
 reply to the message and have the reply also distributed to everyone on the
 mailing list.  This service provides the capability to keep abreast of
 developments or events in a particular subject area.  Most listserv-type
 mailing lists automatically forward all incoming messages to all mailing list
 subscribers.  There are thousands of such mailing list services on the
 Internet, collectively with hundreds of thousands of subscribers.  Users of
 "open" listservs typically can add or remove their names from the mailing list
 automatically, with no direct human involvement.  Listservs may also be
 "closed," i.e., only allowing for one's acceptance into the listserv by a
 human moderator.

 25.  Distributed message databases.  Similar in function to listservs -- but
 quite different in how communications are transmitted -- are distributed
 message databases such as "USENET newsgroups."  User-sponsored newsgroups are
 among the most popular and widespread applications of Internet services, and
 cover all imaginable topics of interest to users.  Like listservs, newsgroups
 are open discussions and exchanges on particular topics.  Users, however, need
 not subscribe to the discussion mailing list in advance, but can instead
 access the database at any time.  Some USENET newsgroups are "moderated" but
 most are open access.  For the moderated newsgroups, all messages to the
 newsgroup are forwarded to one person who can screen them for relevance to the
 topics under discussion.  USENET newsgroups are disseminated using ad hoc,
 peer to peer connections between approximately 200,000 computers (called
 USENET "servers") around the world.  For unmoderated newsgroups, when an
 individual user with access to a USENET server posts a message to a newsgroup,
 the message is automatically forwarded to all adjacent USENET servers that
 furnish access to the newsgroup, and it is then propagated to the servers
 adjacent to those servers, etc.  The messages are temporarily stored on each
 receiving server, where they are available for review and response by
 individual users.  The messages are automatically and periodically purged from
 each system after a time to make room for new messages.  Responses to
 messages, like the original messages, are automatically distributed to all
 other computers receiving the newsgroup or forwarded to a moderator in the
 case of a moderated newsgroup.  The dissemination of messages to USENET
 servers around the world is an automated process that does not require direct
 human intervention or review.

 26.  There are newsgroups on more than fifteen thousand different subjects.
 In 1994, approximately 70,000 messages were posted to newsgroups each day, and
 those messages were distributed to the approximately 190,000 computers or
 computer networks that participate in the USENET newsgroup system.  Once the
 messages reach the approximately 190,000 receiving computers or computer
 networks, they are available to individual users of those computers or
 computer networks.  Collectively, almost 100,000 new messages (or "articles")
 are posted to newsgroups each day.

 27.  Real time communication.  In addition to transmitting messages that can
 be later read or accessed, individuals on the Internet can engage in an
 immediate dialog, in "real time", with other people on the Internet.  In its
 simplest forms, "talk" allows one-to-one communications and "Internet Relay
 Chat" (or IRC) allows two or more to type messages to each other that almost
 immediately appear on the others' computer screens.  IRC is analogous to a
 telephone party line, using a computer and keyboard rather than a telephone.
 With IRC, however, at any one time there are thousands of different party
 lines available, in which collectively tens of thousands of users are engaging
 in conversations on a huge range of subjects.  Moreover, one can create a new
 party line to discuss a different topic at any time.  Some IRC conversations
 are "moderated" or include "channel operators."

 28.  In addition, commercial online services such as America Online,
 CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, and Prodigy have their own "chat" systems
 allowing their members to converse.

 29.  Real time remote computer utilization.  Another method to use information
 on the Internet is to access and control remote computers in "real time" using
 "telnet."  For example, using telnet, a researcher at a university would be
 able to use the computing power of a supercomputer located at a different
 university.  A student can use telnet to connect to a remote library to access
 the library's online card catalog program.

 30.  Remote information retrieval.  The final major category of communication
 may be the most well known use of the Internet -- the search for and retrieval
 of information located on remote computers.  There are three primary methods
 to locate and retrieve information on the Internet.

 31.  A simple method uses "ftp" (or file transfer protocol) to list the names
 of computer files available on a remote computer, and to transfer one or more
 of those files to an individual's local computer.

 32.  Another approach uses a program and format named "gopher" to guide an
 individual's search through the resources available on a remote computer.

 33.  A third approach, and fast becoming the most well-known on the Internet,
 is the "World Wide Web."  The Web utilizes a "hypertext" formatting language
 called hypertext markup language (HTML), and programs that "browse" the Web
 can display HTML documents containing text, images, sound, animation and
 moving video.  Any HTML document can include links to other types of
 information or resources, so that while viewing an HTML document that, for
 example, describes resources available on the Internet, one can "click" using
 a computer mouse on the description of the resource and be immediately
 connected to the resource itself.  Such "hyperlinks" allow information to be
 accessed and organized in very flexible ways, and allow people to locate and
 efficiently view related information even if the information is stored on
 numerous computers all around the world.

 34.  Purpose.  The World Wide Web (W3C) was created to serve as the platform
 for a global, online store of knowledge, containing information from a
 diversity of sources and accessible to Internet users around the world.
 Though information on the Web is contained in individual computers, the fact
 that each of these computers is connected to the Internet through W3C
 protocols allows all of the information to become part of a single body of
 knowledge.  It is currently the most advanced information system developed on
 the Internet, and embraces within its data model most information in previous
 networked information systems such as ftp, gopher, wais, and Usenet.

 35.  History.  W3C was originally developed at CERN, the European Particle
 Physics Laboratory, and was initially used to allow information sharing within
 internationally dispersed teams of researchers and engineers.  Originally
 aimed at the High Energy Physics community, it has spread to other areas and
 attracted much interest in user support, resource recovery, and many other
 areas which depend on collaborative and information sharing.  The Web has
 extended beyond the scientific and academic community to include
 communications by individuals, non-profit organizations, and businesses.

 36.  Basic Operation.  The World Wide Web is a series of documents stored in
 different computers all over the Internet.  Documents contain information
 stored in a variety of formats, including text, still images, sounds, and
 video.  An essential element of the Web is that any document has an address
 (rather like a telephone number).  Most Web documents contain "links."  These
 are short sections of text or image which refer to another document.
 Typically the linked text is blue or underlined when displayed, and when
 selected by the user, the referenced document is automatically displayed,
 wherever in the world it actually is stored.  Links for example are used to
 lead from overview documents to more detailed documents, from tables of
 contents to particular pages, but also as cross-references, footnotes, and
 new forms of information structure.

 37.  Many organizations now have "home pages" on the Web.  These are documents
 which provide a set of links designed to represent the organization, and
 through links from the home page, guide the user directly or indirectly to
 information about or relevant to that organization.

 38.  As an example of the use of links, if these Findings were to be put on a
 World Wide Web site, its home page might contain links such as those:

 *THE NATURE OF CYBERSPACE

 *CREATION OF THE INTERNET AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CYBERSPACE

 *HOW PEOPLE ACCESS THE INTERNET

 *METHODS TO COMMUNICATE OVER THE INTERNET

 39.  Each of these links takes the user of the site from the beginning of the
 Findings to the appropriate section within this Adjudication.  Links may also
 take the user from the original Web site to another Web site on another
 computer connected to the Internet.  These links from one computer to another,
 from one document to another across the Internet, are what unify the Web into
 a single body of knowledge, and what makes the Web unique.  The Web was
 designed with a maximum target time to follow a link of one tenth of a second.

 40.  Publishing.  The World Wide Web exists fundamentally as a platform
 through which people and organizations can communicate through shared
 information.  When information is made available, it is said to be "published"
 on the Web.  Publishing on the Web simply requires that the "publisher" has a
 computer connected to the Internet and that the computer is running W3C server
 software.  The computer can be as simple as a small personal computer costing
 less than $1500 dollars or as complex as a multi-million dollar mainframe
 computer.  Many Web publishers choose instead to lease disk storage space from
 someone else who has the necessary computer facilities, eliminating the need
 for actually owning any equipment oneself.

 41.  The Web, as a universe of network accessible information, contains a
 variety of documents prepared with quite varying degrees of care, from the
 hastily typed idea, to the professionally executed corporate profile.  The
 power of the Web stems from the ability of a link to point to any document,
 regardless of its status or physical location.

 42.  Information to be published on the Web must also be formatted according
 to the rules of the Web standards.  These standardized formats assure that all
 Web users who want to read the material will be able to view it.  Web
 standards are sophisticated and flexible enough that they have grown to meet
 the publishing needs of many large corporations, banks, brokerage houses,
 newspapers and magazines which now publish "online" editions of their
 material, as well as government agencies, and even courts, which use the Web
 to disseminate information to the public.  At the same time, Web publishing is
 simple enough that thousands of individual users and small community
 organizations are using the Web to publish their own personal "home pages,"
 the equivalent of individualized newsletters about that person or
 organization, which are available to everyone on the Web.

 43.  Web publishers have a choice to make their Web sites open to the general
 pool of all Internet users, or close them, thus making the information
 accessible only to those with advance authorization.  Many publishers choose
 to keep their sites open to all in order to give their information the widest
 potential audience.  In the event that the publishers choose to maintain
 restrictions on access, this may be accomplished by assigning specific user
 names and passwords as a prerequisite to access to the site.  Or, in the case
 of Web sites maintained for internal use of one organization, access will only
 be allowed from other computers within that organization's local network.

 44.  Searching the Web.  A variety of systems have developed that allow users
 of the Web to search particular information among all of the public sites that
 are part of the Web.  Services such as Yahoo, Magellan, Altavista, Webcrawler,
 and Lycos are all services known as "search engines" which allow users to
 search for Web sites that contain certain categories of information, or to
 search for key words.  For example, a Web user looking for the text of Supreme
 Court opinions would type the words "Supreme Court" into a search engine, and
 then be presented with a list of World Wide Web sites that contain Supreme
 Court information.  This list would actually be a series of links to those
 sites.  Having searched out a number of sites that might contain the desired
 information, the user would then follow individual links, browsing through the
 information on each site, until the desired material is found.  For many
 content providers on the Web, the ability to be found by these search engines
 is very important.

 45.  Common standards.  The Web links together disparate information on an
 ever-growing number of Internet-linked computers by setting common information
 storage formats (HTML) and a common language for the exchange of Web documents
 (HTTP).  Although the information itself may be in many different formats, and
 stored on computers which are not otherwise compatible, the basic Web
 standards provide a basic set of standards which allow communication and
 exchange of information.  Despite the fact that many types of computers are
 used on the Web, and the fact that many of these machines are otherwise
 incompatible, those who "publish" information on the Web are able to
 communicate with those who seek to access information with little difficulty
 because of these basic technical standards.

 46.  A distributed system with no centralized control.  Running on tens of
 thousands of individual computers on the Internet, the Web is what is known as
 a distributed system.  The Web was designed so that organizations with
 computers containing information can become part of the Web simply by
 attaching their computers to the Internet and running appropriate World Wide
 Web software.  No single organization controls any membership in the Web, nor
 is there any single centralized point from which individual Web sites or
 services can be blocked from the Web.  From a user's perspective, it may
 appear to be a single, integrated system, but in reality it has no centralized
 control point.

 47.  Contrast to closed databases.  The Web's open, distributed, decentralized
 nature stands in sharp contrast to most information systems that have come
 before it.  Private information services such as Westlaw, Lexis/Nexis, and
 Dialog, have contained large storehouses of knowledge, and can be accessed
 from the Internet with the appropriate passwords and access software.
 However, these databases are not linked together into a single whole, as is
 the World Wide Web.

 48.  Success of the Web in research, education, and political activities.  The
 World Wide Web has become so popular because of its open, distributed, and
 easy-to-use nature.  Rather than requiring those who seek information to
 purchase new software or hardware, and to learn a new kind of system for each
 new database of information they seek to access, the Web environment makes it
 easy for users to jump from one set of information to another.  By the same
 token, the open nature of the Web makes it easy for publishers to reach their
 intended audiences without having to know in advance what kind of computer
 each potential reader has, and what kind of software they will be using.

 Editor's Note:  The court papers for this case generated quite a bit of
 interesting reading and it is possible that additional extractions will appear
 in future issues.

 Next Month
 ----------

 Traditionally, the August issue has previewed the ONE BBSCON.  With the death
 of the BBSCON, we will run an article about its legacy.  There will be a
 preview of the first ONE ISPCON, but we will have far less coverage of the
 show compared to last year when Tampa hosted the last ONE BBSCON.  Look for
 all our regular features, along with the latest news.

 The August issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine will be available on, or before,
 July 22.  Make sure you do not miss a single issue of Tampa Bay's oldest free
 on-line magazine!
