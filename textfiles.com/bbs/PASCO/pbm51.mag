 Editor's Welcome
 ----------------

 Has it really been four years since the first issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine
 was released the day after Christmas in 1992?  Sometimes it seems like only
 yesterday and, yes, sometimes it seems more like forty years.  Thanks are due
 to all those who have helped make it possible (you know who you are)!  Thanks
 also to the faithful readers and the occasional readers too!  It has been an
 incredible run.  Thank you!

 This is a Special Fourth Anniversary Issue and we do reflect back on the past
 year.  We take a look at Nels Anderson's Arcanum Computing and include some
 comments from the popular Shareware author.  Ed Garwood continues his very
 informative Computer Basics series and BBS Basics returns with an updated
 version of What is a Zip file?  There is also another extraction from the on-
 line humor magazine ROTFL! Digest.

 In this issue, I insinuate that this magazine will be around for some time to
 come.  After I wrote that, I did slip into the old "why am I doing this"
 syndrome.  It made me think how vulnerable this publication really is.  An on-
 line magazine, software company, or anything else that is primarily the
 creation of a single individual, does have a high level of vulnerability.
 Whether it be health problems, changes in priorities, or changes in attitude,
 such creations are susceptible to an unexpected and unexplained demise.  There
 are things that can increase the odds of survival, such as receiving articles
 from readers of the magazine.  I know sometimes it sounds like a broken
 record, but it would be great to receive more articles from other people.
 But, I guess that is enough of that type of stuff.  This issue, and next
 month's Special Fiftieth Issue, are celebrations of the Pasco BBS Magazine.
 And yes, there is much to celebrate.

 I am proud of what has been accomplished and remain optimistic about the
 future of the Pasco BBS Magazine.  I am very grateful to those who have helped
 over the years.  It has been a humbling experience.  Thanks for reading and
 best of luck in the new year.

 Four Years of the Pasco BBS Magazine
 ------------------------------------

 This issue begins the fifth year of publication for the Pasco BBS Magazine.
 That means before we forge ahead, it is a time to reflect.  In this article
 we'll continue the tradition of briefly looking back at the history of this
 publication, with the emphasis placed on the previous year.  We will thank
 those who have helped make it possible for the magazine to enjoy a fourth
 anniversary.  It should be noted that previous anniversary issues have gone
 into great detail about this magazine, so this article does not intend to
 rehash everything that has happened over the last four years.

 The very first issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine was released on December 26,
 1992 and it has been published every month since.  Forty-nine straight months
 have made this "Tampa Bay's oldest free on-line magazine."  In fact, there is
 only one publication in the state, a free on-line magazine out of
 Jacksonville, which has been around longer.

 The January 1996 issue kicked off the fourth year of publication with a bang.
 I attempted to log into every BBS in west Pasco County and presented my
 findings in an article titled "Pasco BBS Tour."  The article was promoted as
 not just an article, but an event, the first ever Pasco BBS Tour.  It was also
 called the most detailed look at our local on-line community ever published.
 It was quite an undertaking, one which will undoubtedly never be attempted
 again, at least by me.  That article generated the most feedback of 1996.  I
 pulled no punches and was left with a negative impression of some systems, an
 impression I had no problem sharing with readers of the magazine.  Actually,
 considering some of what was written, I was surprised that there were not more
 negative comments about the Pasco BBS Tour.  The positive feedback outnumbered
 the negative by a 2-1 ratio.  No system operator took up the offer of
 rebutting what was written in the article.

 Some of the other highlights of the past year included an exclusive interview
 with Kathy and Michael Sussell, the system operators of New York City's
 Invention Factory BBS.  The March issue was our second Special Gaming Issue
 and the Complete Shareware Gaming Catalog, which was now a separate file,
 looked at over 250 of the most popular Shareware games.  In April, a series of
 articles began called "Computer Basics," which were written by local computer
 club activist Ed Garwood.  That issue also featured a couple of comments from
 readers.  John Zagar sent along an article called "Remembering Computers,"
 which sort of became the theme for the July issue.  In August, the last in a
 long series of articles written by Paul Pollack was published.  Paul has
 written some wonderful pieces, which have run in the magazine over the last
 couple of years.  Paul moved on to other projects, but I would imagine we have
 not heard the last of him.  The September issue was related to gambling and
 computer related gambling programs and was called a "Special Gamble 'zine
 Issue." Throughout the year, we continued to run extractions from ROTFL!
 Digest, an on-line humor magazine.

 What remains the biggest surprise and disappointment about this publication?
 The fact that so few people contribute to the magazine.  I would publish
 virtually anything computer related, so people could generate some publicity
 for their endeavors.  I am so thankful to those who do contribute, but am
 surprised that more people do not.  Considering how long I have been at this,
 I guess I should not be surprised any longer.  I guess it would not be an
 anniversary issue without me mentioning this frustration.

 What about the future?  There is no reason to believe that the Pasco BBS
 Magazine will not be around for some time to come.  A fifth anniversary issue,
 a tenth anniversary issue, who knows.  It is hard to say.  As long as I'm
 living in this area, and running a hobby BBS, the magazine should be published
 each month.  Thanks again to everyone who has made it all possible.

 Nels Anderson's Arcanum Computing
 ---------------------------------

 In the first issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine, popular Shareware author Nels
 Anderson was featured in an exclusive interview.  Born in Connecticut, Nels
 Anderson moved to Massachusetts following graduation from Worcester
 Polytechnic Institute in 1978.  He had jobs at Honeywell and Prime Computer,
 where he worked with Dan Linton and Dick Olsen, before going into
 Shareware/BBSing on a full-time basis in 1989.  He released his first game Mah
 Jongg in 1987 and today, under the name Arcanum Computing, he has an entire
 line of Shareware Games.  This article looks at the programs in the Arcanum
 Computing collection, along with a peek at his home page on the World Wide Web
 and his Xevious BBS.  Some comments from Nels Anderson, extracted from the
 January 1993 issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine, have been included.

 GAME:  Cipher, Cipher For Windows
 INITIAL RELEASE:  Cipher 1990, Cipher for Windows 1991
 ABSTRACT:  Cipher is a crypt-quotes type word puzzle game, similar to the
 puzzles that have appeared in newspapers for years in a variety of forms.
 A crypto-quote is where a phrase is written with one letter of the alphabet
 being substituted for another, forming a cipher.  As its name implies, Cipher
 and Cipher For Windows are computerized versions of these puzzles.  One
 problem with working a cipher on paper is that the trial and error involved
 just wears out the paper.  A computer screen is much better for this task.
 With Cipher it's easy to try different letters, erase the ones that don't seem
 to work, start over from scratch and so on.  Another problem with printed
 puzzles is that if you get stuck your only alternative is to look at the
 answer.  With Cipher, you can get hints that will help you along without
 giving everything away.  You have your choice of just how much help you want
 to get.  Over 200 quotations are included with the registered game and
 additional puzzle collections are available.
 COMMENTS FROM NELS ANDERSON:  "Very few game ideas are totally original and
 that's been the case with all my games.  Cipher was taken right out of the
 newspaper puzzle section."

 GAME:  Dragons Bane: Mah Jongg II
 INITIAL RELEASE:  1995
 ABSTRACT:  This is a second generation version of the popular and addictive
 solitaire tile game Mah Jongg.  Dragons Bane takes only a few minutes to learn
 to play, but winning is always a challenge.  It is easy to play and filled
 with features.  The game supports SVGA and VGA graphics, plus SoundBlaster and
 other sound cards.  It includes many tile sets plus an editor to make your
 own.  The program includes different board layouts and an editor for layouts
 too.

 GAME:  EGATrek
 INITIAL RELEASE:  1988
 ABSTRACT:  Even back in the early days of computers there were computer games.
 EGATrek is an updated version of one of the very first computer games.  It
 plays the same, as those who experienced the original minicomputer versions
 will agree, but it has graphics updated for the '90's.  EGATrek puts you in
 command of a starship in a battle to save the galaxy.  A large invasion fleet
 has arrived and you alone are responsible for fighting off the invaders in
 your quadrant.  You'll be kept busy figuring out battle strategy as you go
 from encounter to encounter.  In addition, you'll need to find star bases to
 re-supply your ship.  You may be called on to make rescues of other ships or
 planets.  And you must do it all as quickly as possible without running out of
 fuel or getting your ship destroyed.  This challenge has kept players coming
 back since the earliest days of computing.  The game can be played at five
 difficulty levels, to suit the beginner or the expert.  The highest level has
 been set to be almost unbeatable but expert players have been able to do
 it...maybe you can be one of them!
 COMMENTS FROM NELS ANDERSON:  "EGATrek was inspired by the classic
 minicomputer game, one of the first computer games ever, that I've traced back
 at least as far as 1971."

 GAME:  Mah Jongg
 INITIAL RELEASE:  1987
 ABSTRACT:  Since its original release Mah Jongg has proven to be a very
 popular and even addictive solitaire game.  It is very easy to learn to play,
 but always a challenge to win.  All that is required is finding matching pairs
 of tiles from the selection placed face up on the playing surface.  The game
 comes complete with a tile editor utility called Tile Maker that lets you
 create your own tile sets or edit an existing sets.  In this way you can have
 your own customized version of this classic game.
 COMMENTS FROM NELS ANDERSON:  "Mah Jongg was a computer game long before I did
 my version, though I did not know of any version for MS-DOS PCs when I first
 did mine.  I guess Mah Jongg is still my favorite.  Partially because it was
 my first, but also since it's one of the few games that I can play myself.
 One disadvantage of programming games is that the ones you create are often
 not much fun to play, since you already know all the tricks!  The game was
 actually a combined learning experience rather than something that was
 originally intended as a product.  I was trying to learn PCs, the C
 programming language, and how EGA graphics worked, all at the same time.  My
 tinkering gradually developed into my Mah Jongg solitaire game."

 GAME:  Second Guess
 INITIAL RELEASE:  1993
 ABSTRACT:  Concentration solitaire is easy to play, but it is a good test of
 your memory.  Starting with a board of tile pairs placed face down you must
 find the matching pairs.  However, Second Guess is more than just a standard
 concentration solitaire game.  It can be played competitively by two to four
 players, or you can play against the computer.  Second Guess includes a tile
 editor.

 GAME:  Shih Dao
 INITIAL RELEASE:  1994
 ABSTRACT:  Shih Dao is a Windows based tile strategy game, which challenges
 the player to earn points by placing tiles of the same color or pattern next
 to each other.  Built in hints can help you place tiles and players can look
 ahead at upcoming tiles to plan future moves.  There is also graphical online
 help.  Careful play will get you a high score, while careless moves will bring
 the game to a quick end.  Finding four way matches will rack up the points.

 GAME:  Shooting Gallery
 INITIAL RELEASE:  1990
 ABSTRACT:  Shooting Gallery is a combination of target shooting games using
 colorful graphics and sound effects.  Seven different rounds of shooting fun
 are included!  From the arcade shooting range where its name comes from to
 skeet shooting to quick draw, Shooting Gallery has something for everyone.
 There's even a wild west shootout in the final round where you must pick off
 the bad guys.
 COMMENTS FROM NELS ANDERSON:  "Shooting Gallery was suggested by a friend,
 though the real life shooting ranges it represents have been around for a long
 time."

 GAME:  SuperFly
 INITIAL RELEASE:  1991
 ABSTRACT:  The flies have invaded your house, along with a host of other
 insect pests.  In SuperFly, you must use strategy plus quick reflexes to
 eliminate the insect menace!  SuperFly includes 20 different levels, each of
 which requires a different strategy to complete. Armed with fly swatters and
 other objects you find during play you must swat your way around the house
 until you can get the Super Fly.
 COMMENTS FROM NELS ANDERSON:  "SuperFly is actually an updated version of
 another pre-PC era computer game.  Where I worked we had a programmable
 computer terminal (the screen and keyboard you use when connected to a
 minicomputer) and this terminal could play exactly one game: 'Fly.'  The
 terminal did not support graphics, so the flies were just asterisks.  A very
 simple game, it was still very addictive and many lunch hours were spent
 moving the cursor around swatting asterisks.  SuperFly is a graphical version
 of basically the same game, though with multiple rounds, different bug types
 and other obstacles a lot has been added to the original concept."

 GAME:  Tile Match
 INITIAL RELEASE:  1992
 ABSTRACT:  Tile Match is a solitaire game that makes a great companion for Mah
 Jongg solitaire.  It's based on concentration solitaire (also known as memory
 solitaire) and uses the same tile sets as Mah Jongg.  The game is simple to
 play.  You start with a group of tiles placed face down and the object is to
 find matching pairs as you turn the tiles over two at a time.  Different board
 sizes and number of identical tiles make for a game that can be as easy or as
 difficult as you wish.  It is not just solitaire either, it can be played by
 two to four players, or you can play against the computer.  The game comes
 complete with a tile editor utility called Tile Maker that lets you create
 your own tile sets or edit an existing sets.

 NELS ANDERSON'S HOME PAGE
 URL:  http://www.ultranet.com/~nels
 ABSTRACT:  Nels Anderson's Home Page on the World Wide Web features
 information on Arcanum Computing and the latest versions of all the programs
 can be download there.  He is also a fan of flight simulators and writes a
 column for MicroWINGS Magazine.  The home page contains plenty of information
 on flight simulators, general aviation and weather resources, and contains
 links to related sites.
 COMMENTS FROM NELS ANDERSON:  "One of my favorite activities is flight sims,
 and I started and am currently the host of the RelayNet (or RIME) flight sim
 conference.  I still love playing computer games or using Microsoft Flight
 Simulator.  In fact, a year ago I got my pilot's license--I needed an excuse
 to get out of the house more often, since spending a lot of time at home can
 be a disadvantage at times."

 XEVIOUS BBS
 TELEPHONE NUMBER:  (508) 788-6951
 ABSTRACT:  The Xevious BBS, located in Framingham, Massachusetts, is a full
 service bulletin board system offering over 20,000 MS-DOS and Windows files
 plus some 100 messages conferences, including RelayNet conferences.  Xevious
 has been in operation since 1983 and Nels Anderson has been Sysop since 1985.
 The board is the support BBS for Arcanum Computer and specializes in flight
 simulators and aviation, with one of the best collections of such files to be
 found in any one place.  Currently over 2,300 files on this topic are
 available for download.  Xevious also has an exclusive collection of aviation

 COMMENTS FROM NELS ANDERSON:  "The original Xevious was started by another
 fellow way back in 1983 and was located in Needham, Massachusetts.  It was my
 favorite BBS.  When he announced he was shutting down I talked it over with
 some of the other regular users and ended up buying the system from him and
 eventually moving it to my home in Framingham.  It's been here since mid-1985.
 Originally the system was run on Apple II's, which is what I and all my
 friends had in the early 1980's.  When my Shareware business got going I
 converted the BBS to MS-DOS computers and it's grown like crazy, right along
 with my Shareware business."

 At one time or another, we find the need to delete one or more files from
 either our hard drive, or from a floppy disk.  If it is a simple "run of the
 Mill" file, it should prove no problem.  However, not all files are simple,
 and therefore do become problems.

 But, let's take the simple case first.  Let's assume we have a file called
 "SIMPLE.TXT" on an A Drive Floppy.  Go to the A Drive, and type

 DEL SIMPLE.TXT        and press ENTER

 The file will probably disappear from the A Drive directory list.  (If it
 doesn't, and you get an Error message, it was NOT a simple file, and we'll
 discuss that a little later.

 BUT, suppose you only use WINDOWS, not DOS.  OK.  Put the floppy in the A
 Drive, and Open up FILE MANAGER in Windows, and click on A (upper left corner
 of window).  This will display the directory list of the A Drive floppy.
 Click on the file to be deleted.  This will highlight that file.  Click on
 FILE.  Now click on DELETE.  The DELETE window will open, displaying the name
 of the file you have highlighted.  If you agree with the filename, click on
 OK.  The CONFIRM DELETION box will now appear and ask you if you want to
 delete the file whose name appears.  If you agree, click on YES.  Now you can
 close the File Manager Box and go about your business.  You may also wish to
 stop and reflect on why I prefer the simple commands of DOS to the long
 rigmarole of Windows.

 Now for the "Not so Simple" cases involving Error Messages.

 One of the most common error messages is "Access Denied."  Why are you denied
 access to your own files, you wonder.  Well, for one reason or another, some
 files are protected by something we call an ATTRIBUTE.  Attributes are
 "System", "Hidden", or "Read Only."

 There are many reasons for attributes, some good, and some not so good.  But,
 they are a fact of Life in computers.  So, we must live with them.  For
 instance, I have made my AUTOEXEC.BAT file, CONFIG.SYS file, and all of my DOS
 commands "Read Only" so I do not accidently delete them.

 Hidden files and System files have to do with the proper operation of your
 computer and its operating system.  Hence, it is most unlikely that you may
 wish to delete them.  If in doubt, DON'T.

 So, the file you have been unable to delete probably has a "Read Only"
 attribute.  Assume you have a file named "NOGOOD.TXT" which you are unable to
 delete.  At the prompt, type

 ATTRIB A:\NOGOOD.TXT      and press ENTER

 and the screen will display the message:

 A     R      A:\NOGOOD.TXT

 The R means "Read Only," to remove the R attribute, just type

 ATTRIB A:\NOGOOD.TXT -R      and press ENTER

 The Read Only attribute has been removed, and you may now delete the file.

 To do this in Windows, go to File Manager, click on A Drive, and in the file
 menu, choose the file.  Then click on File and Click on Properties.  This will
 bring up the properties window.  At the bottom of this window are four boxes,
 marked Read Only, Archive, Hidden, and System respectively.  There will
 probably be a "X" in the "Archive" box, which is normal.  If there is a "X" in
 any other box, the file has that attribute.  For instance, if there is a "X"
 in the Read Only box, the file is a read only file.  To remove the read only
 attribute, put your mouse arrow on that box and click.  The "X" will
 disappear.  You may now delete that file.

 Another error message will say "Unable to find file."  Either you have not
 spelled the file name (or the extension) correctly, or the file name is
 flawed.  The latter situation occurs when you have a file name with a space in
 it.  For instance, BAD FILE.TXT is a flawed file name because of the space
 between BAD and FILE, which is a definite NO-NO.

 There are two possible remedies here.  In one case, rename the file by typing
 a "?" in the space.  For instance, in DOS, type:

 REN BAD?FILE.TXT BADFILE.TXT     and press Enter

 and then proceed to delete BADFILE.TXT.  Or, you can type:

 DEL BAD?FILE.TXT    and press ENTER

 In either case, the "?" acts as a 'wild card' entry as part of the file name.
 NOTE: Deleting BAD?FILE.TXT will work in Windows, BUT, renaming BAD?FILE.TXT
 cannot be done in WINDOWS

 You may delete a block of files all at once.  For instance, if you have
 BADFILE1.TXT, BADFILE2.TXT and BADFILE3.TXT, you can delete BADFILE?.TXT and
 delete all three at once.  Or, you could say Delete *.TXT which would delete
 ALL files with the .TXT extension.  Be careful in this case and make certain
 that you do not inadvertently include a .TXT file which you do NOT want to
 delete.

 The Way You Post E-Mail Reveals Your Personality   (c)1995 Sandy Illes

 After years of scientific study and several minutes of profound thought, it
 has now been conclusively proven that the way you post e-mail reveals your
 personality!  Why sit back and let others do the analyzing when you, too, can
 become a noted net psychologist?

 Lesson 1

 Sample: Were r all the warez, d00d?

 The person who wrote this is obviously a pathetic teenager who desperately
 needs a girlfriend, a life, and some spelling lessons.  If you try to tell him
 that, he will respond by insulting your mother, calling you a fag, and
 threatening to upload a virus to your computer.  In reality, he knows as much
 about viruses as, say, your cat - but he talks a good game of scare tactics.

 Lesson 2

 Sample: I need a copy of [insert name of commercial program here].

 This person is a lamer pirate, oblivious to the fact that large corporations
 (such as those that make commercial software) and government agencies
 regularly surf the nets.  He knows as much about software as he does about
 discretion.

 Lesson 3

 Sample: [in a non-tech conference] Help!  My modem doesn't work.

 While it is easy to pity someone whose modem doesn't work, it behooves me to
 ask:  Exactly how did he get online without a modem?  The fact that he was
 unable to read the conference name before posting a message to the entire free
 world makes me wonder if he even belongs online in the first place.  This
 person probably took a week to find the turbo key on his computer and still
 doesn't know how to set his VCR.  Never, ever, ask him any hardware questions
 because he will - God help you - try to answer them.

 Lesson 4

 Sample: So what are you wearing right now?

 This person is so incredibly lonely - not to even mention ugly -that he has to
 flirt with every person whose name sounds female.  While he sits at the
 keyboard telling the object of his affection how good looking, smart, and
 talented he is, it's easy for him to forget that the recipient is probably
 some dorky 13-year-old boy who has chosen a female alias for a quick thrill.
 The only way to deal with people like this is to tell them where to find the
 x-rated GIF's.

 Lesson 5

 Sample: Why don't you just shut up, idiot?

 This person, fresh from Charm School, wants attention and is willing to become
 flamebait to make sure he gets noticed.  The only way to deal with rude people
 like this is to find out who they really are, track them down, and shoot them
 like the dogs they are.

 Lesson 6

 Sample: You're false christian (sic) scum.

 You have just met Steve Winter, Fidonet's most intolerant and verbally abusive
 resident moderator.  There is no way to deal with him so just forget it and
 move along to another conference.

 Lesson 7

 Sample: What kind of crap is this, you dumb etc., etc., etc.

 This person is obviously starved for attention and will do anything to get it.
 Never mind that the kind of attention is along the lines of "Do you EAT with
 that mouth???" he's happy that he's not being ignored.  The best way to deal
 with him is to introduce him to Steve Winter.

 Lesson 8

 Sample: If you connect your modem to your food processor and set it to puree,
 you can connect to the Internet for free.  This works best if you use a null
 modem cable and say 10 Hail Marys while making the sign of the Spam.

 This person is not in touch with reality.  If they were, it would be even
 scarier for you.  Ignoring them will not make them go away - the best thing
 you can do is reply and tell them that Elvis speaks to you through your
 toaster.  The key is to be weirder than they are.

 Lesson 9

 Sample: Why does Michael Jackson shop at K-Mart?  Because boy's pants are half
 off.  Hahahahahaaaahahahahaaaaaa

 While this person thinks he is funny, in fact, he is telling the oldest net-
 joke known to man.  Another variation is "What did Jeffrey Dahmer say to
 Lorena Bobbitt?"  This person deserves to be flamed, not just because his
 jokes are prehistoric, but because he should have read backwards in the
 conference for 5 messages and then he could have seen his joke.  Probably more
 than once.  Ignoring him will not make him go away so your only recourse is a
 quick and clever flame.

 On December 6, the Supreme Court justices voted to review the controversial
 Communications Decency Act.  Two judicial panels have declared the new law
 unconstitutionally vague, however, the Supreme Court granted an appeal by the

 not expected until next July.

 A recent survey found that the 36 million United States households hooked into

 What is a ZIP File?
 -------------------

 The majority of the files found on bulletin boards are in the archive format,
 which always gives the novice BBS user problems with the first few downloads.
 Most people log on a board and download some great sounding program and cannot
 figure out how to get it to work.  This leads to more calls to the boards,
 reading bulletins or paging Sysops, in an attempt to find out how to use this
 file they cannot wait to try.  Since most bulletin boards use files with a
 .ZIP extension, users learn quickly about file compression.

 Why are almost all files on bulletins boards found in the compressed, or
 archive, format?  There are basically two reasons.  One reason is to compress
 the file's size, thus reducing the amount of time it takes to transfer the
 file via the modem connection.  The other reason is to group all the files
 necessary to operate the program under a single name, so the caller does not
 have to download a bunch of different files to get one program to run.

 There are many different authors who have released archive programs, but the
 .ZIP format archive is by far the most common in the BBS world.  Other file
 extensions include .ARJ, .LZH, .PAK, .ARC, .ICE, .ZOO, among others.  When
 these archive utilities are downloaded they come in a self-extracting format,
 so you do not have to know any complicated commands to extract the files.
 Just type the file's name and the program will extract itself, provided that
 there is enough disk space.  Each archive utility includes complete
 documentation on the program's operation.

 The commands for each archive utility differ slightly, but it is a relatively
 simple command line for extracting files from .ZIP files.  The best thing to
 do is to place the archive utility's executable files, for example PKUNZIP.EXE
 and PKZIP.EXE, in your system's path.  It is unfortunate, but most DOS manuals
 do not give a very good explanation of how the path works.  By putting the
 utilities in your path, the commands will work anywhere on your system
 including diskette drives, so the utility does not have to be in the current
 directory to operate.  Your root directory is always on your system's path, so
 copying PKUNZIP.EXE to C:\ will work if you do not have a thorough
 understanding of DOS's path.  However, it is better to place all the utilities
 you wish to use universally on your system in a directory, for example C:\BIN,
 since a cluttered root directory will slow down your system.  The path
 statement, which can be edited with any text editor, is found in your
 AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  In the above example, you would add C:\BIN to the end of
 the path statement, but remember to separate all directories on the path with
 a semi-colon.  For example:

                  Old path    -    PATH C:\;C:\DOS
                  New path    -    PATH C:\;C:\DOS;C:\BIN

 If a file named PBM.ZIP was downloaded, the following is an example of how you
 would extract the files you just downloaded.

                          PKUNZIP PBM C:\HOLD

 The above assumes that you wish to extract the files within PBM.ZIP to a
 directory called C:\HOLD.  PBM could be replaced with any file name you might
 download and it is not necessary to type the .ZIP extension.  C:\HOLD could
 also be replaced with the directory of your choice, or if you want to extract
 the files to the directory where PBM.ZIP currently resides, leave the
 directory off and just type PKUNZIP PBM.

 Under Windows, it is best to exit to DOS to unzip files.  The unziping
 function can then be preformed as described for DOS.  Recently, a Windows
 version of PKZIP has been released, which features a menu-driven interface for
 unziping files.

 There are other commands and many features included with the popular archive
 utilities, but this should get those first downloads unziped.

 PBM Flashback - January 1993
 ----------------------------

 Popular Shareware game author Nels Anderson was featured in an exclusive
 interview in the first issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine in January of 1993.
 There is an article in this issue looking at his programs, which includes
 some of the comments he made in that interview four years ago.  PBM Flashback
 also goes back to that first issue for more of that interesting interview.
 Here is how Nels Anderson responded when asked if he had any comments on how
 popular his games have become.  Was he surprized or disappointed by the
 number of registered users?

 "I've been quite surprised at how many people have wanted to register my
 games.  When I first released Mah Jongg I told my friends at work who had
 helped me with testing and suggestions, that if I ever made $100 off of it
 I'd take them all out to lunch.  Well, my first registration arrived in
 about a week and it wasn't long before we had our lunch date.  I started
 putting pins in a U.S. map where each registration came from, but it wasn't
 long before no more pins would fit in some areas!  Even after five years I
 still think it's great that a system like this can work.  I've had
 registrations from all fifty states and over fifty foreign countries as
 well.  Amazing!"

 Editor's Note:  PBM Flashback will appear on a regular basis in future issues.
 Each issue will have this brief look back at some of the features which have
 appeared over the history of the Pasco BBS Magazine.
