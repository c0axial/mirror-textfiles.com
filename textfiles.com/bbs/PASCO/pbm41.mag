 Editor's Welcome
 ----------------

 Thank you for taking the time to check out this Special Third Anniversary
 Issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine!  Three years, wow!  Who would have thunk it!

 I guess I could have regurgitated some old articles for this anniversary
 issue and called it "The Best of the Pasco BBS Magazine."  That common
 practice would have been an easy way to start the fourth year of publication.
 I could have rambled on about all that has been accomplished, about how great
 the magazine is, but I have to admit that I've been there, done that.  Look at
 the first anniversary issue for the proof.  Geez, I did go on.  There is a
 short article thanking those who have helped out over the first three years,
 but this month's highlight is not just an article, but an event!  The first
 ever Pasco BBS Tour!  I hope you enjoy the most detailed look at our local on-
 line community ever published.  I hope that those who do not live in Pasco
 County enjoy it as well.  Along with all our regular features, this month has
 a great review of Epic MegaGames' Jazz Jackrabbit written by Paul Pollack.

 Thanks to everyone who has helped make it possible for the Pasco BBS Magazine
 to celebrate a third anniversary!  Hopefully, we will celebrate many more.

 Three Years of the Pasco BBS Magazine
 -------------------------------------

 The Pasco BBS Magazine was first published on the day after Christmas 1992.
 Three years later, it is still around.  I am sure that few would have thought
 that this magazine would be around three years later.  After all, the number
 of free on-line magazines that have been published every month for over three
 years is a very short list indeed.  As is the case with most free on-line
 magazines, which are almost always the creation of a single individual, it
 could come to an end at anytime.  Three years ago I did not know how long the
 Pasco BBS Magazine would last.  Today, I still have no idea.  This is now
 Tampa Bay's longest running free on-line magazine, perhaps the current goal
 could be to expand that distinction.  In a way, I would prefer to look ahead,
 rather than look back, but an anniversary is always time for reflection.

 In the first anniversary issue I went on for quite some time talking about how
 the magazine had beaten the odds.  The Editor's Welcome opened with:  "Over a
 year of doing the Pasco BBS Magazine!  Geez, sometimes it seems like ten
 years."  It still does seem like the magazine has been around longer than
 forever.  There was an article called "One Year of the Pasco BBS Magazine,"
 where I wrote:  "The magazine seemed to be out of control."  There was another
 article on "The Future of the Pasco BBS Magazine," where I did my typical
 begging for articles.  I also commented in that article that ""I am the Dr.
 Frankenstein to this monster."  A third article discussed the "Revised
 Distribution Method."  By the second anniversary issue, an article titled "Two
 Years of the Pasco BBS Magazine" ran only several paragraphs.  At the time, I
 said proof that the magazine had arrived was that I was not making as big a
 deal out the second anniversary, compared to the first anniversary.  Perhaps,
 showing a lack of originality, or just carrying on a tradition, I titled this
 article "Three Years of the Pasco BBS Magazine."

 Instead of regurgitating a bunch of old articles, which is a typical practice
 for anniversary issues, I suggest you look back at the first and second
 anniversary issue for more on the history of the Pasco BBS Magazine.  I would
 prefer to forge ahead and close this article with a paragraph of thanks.

 I do want to thank everyone who has contributed to the continued success of
 the magazine.  The loyal readers, those who have written articles and those
 who have supported the magazine in various ways.  I thank you all very much.
 I do want to take the risk of mentioning a few folks by name.  I say risk
 because I hope I do not forget to mention someone.  To Dan Linton of Software
 Creations BBS:  Thanks for the early support, you deserve every bit of the
 success you now enjoy!  To Clint Bradford of the California based Attention to
 Details BBS:  Thanks!  The help you gave over the first year amazes me to this
 day!  To popular Shareware author Nels Anderson:  Thanks for guaranteeing the
 birth of the Pasco BBS Magazine by agreeing to be interviewed for the first
 issue, and thanks for the subsequent help as well!  To popular BBS utility
 author, and West Pasco County resident, Brent Yandell:  Thanks for the
 continued help and support!  Two people that I want to thank more than any
 others are Rob Marlowe and Paul Pollack.  Rob is the Sysop of Pasco County's
 oldest BBS, the Inner Sanctum, and has provided help and guidance over the
 years.  He has written articles and set up a home page on the World Wide Web
 for the Pasco BBS Magazine.  Paul has written so much stuff, that it really
 has made my life easier.  Paul has also done a great job dressing up the
 magazine's home page on Rob's board.  Thanks guys!  Thank you one and all!

 Pasco BBS Tour
 --------------

 Introduction:  The premise of the Pasco BBS Tour was simple.  Attempt to log
 into every bulletin board in West Pasco County (Florida) and present the most
 detailed account of our local on-line community ever published.  While the
 idea sounded simple, and it was realized that it would be time consuming, it
 ended up being much more work than could be imagined.  However, we hope you
 will find the end result was worth the effort.  The local hobby BBS has always
 been the true strength of the on-line world and Pasco County is blessed with a
 varied and vibrant BBS community.  The Pasco BBS Magazine is very proud to
 present the first ever Pasco BBS Tour!

 Ground Rules:  When the idea of the Pasco BBS Tour was conceived, there was no
 consideration given to any ground rules.  It was thought that we would just
 log into every system, then publish some information and comments about each
 board.  But, a couple of things did come into play.  Part of the concept was
 to review boards from the perspective of the first time caller, who is
 typically just calling to see what a BBS has to offer and may never make a
 second call.  So, no second calls were made to gather additional information.
 Another factor was how some boards make things complicated for the novice
 user.  Examples would be boards that required callers to download some special
 software, or had some sort of call back verification software that new users
 had to deal with.  No efforts were made to download any additional programs,
 or jump through any other hoops, in the quest for information about the board.
 It also has to be disclosed that the Pasco BBS Tour was conducted using a
 fictitious name and fabricated user information.  This made it possible to
 log-on to boards as a first time user and insured that no preferential, or for
 that matter detrimental, treatment would be given out of name recognition.

 Disclaimer and Offer of Rebuttal:  In the course of the Pasco BBS Tour, every
 attempt was made to insure that the boards received equal treatment.  Any
 personal feelings about the Sysop, or the board, good or bad, were not taken
 into account.  In order to make the Pasco BBS Tour worthwhile, it had to
 present the good, the bad and the ugly.  It had to be without prejudice and
 cover all systems.  But, it is realized that some Sysops will be upset with
 what has been written about their boards.  I have no problem with that, and
 offer no apologies, as the Pasco BBS Tour is just one person's opinion.  For
 the record:  The Pasco BBS Tour was conducted and written by the editor of
 this magazine, Richard Ziegler, who takes full responsibility for what has
 been written.  Any system operator, who feels that their bulletin board has
 been the subject of an unfair portrayal, is encouraged to send in a rebuttal
 for publication in a future issue.

 Acknowledgments:  The one person who needs to be thanked is Clark Gilbo,
 editor and founder of the 813 BBS Directory, who has put together a BBS list
 for over four years.  Clark's directory was used as a starting point for the
 Pasco BBS Tour.

 Final Words:  The systems called during the Pasco BBS Tour were up and running
 during late November and early December of 1995.  Considering the up and down
 nature of bulletin boards, some boards listed could have gone off-line by the
 time of publication, and others could have come on-line.  If a board could not
 be logged into, and typically dozens of calls were made in the attempt, it was
 not included in the Pasco BBS Tour.

 And now, without further ado, the Pasco BBS Magazine proudly presents the ...

 BBS Name:  The Attic BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 845-7181
 Sysop:  Blue
 BBS Software:  Maximus
 Year Founded:  1995

 The most unique offering of this BBS may be "The Wanted List" door available
 from the main menu.  It allows callers to request a file and asks other
 callers if they would like to upload the file for the requestor.  The Attic
 BBS has over thirty different doors, but only five bulletins.  The board
 features some FidoNet echos and has sixteen message areas.  The Maximus
 Software package is a bit unique, with sub-areas for different options, which
 could lead to some confusion for the uninitiated.  The log-in procedures are
 relatively simple, including tips on how to select a password and a single
 screen of system rules.  They only post two rules, leave meaningful messages
 and "try not to be a 'file sponge.'"  However, the board does take the caller
 through "Autopost" and a "User Report" before the main menu.  The Attic BBS
 has a second phone number at (813) 845-8061, and grants the first time caller
 45 minutes.

 BBS Name:  The Bachelor Club BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 841-0904
 Sysop:  Steve Thielemann
 BBS Software:  AdeptXBBS
 Year Founded:  1995

 This board runs on a software package written for OS/2 and promotes "The Power
 of OS/2!"  A couple of questions on setting up different mail options makes
 the new user questionnaire longer than average, but there are little
 distractions before reaching the main menu.  The Bachelor Club BBS has three
 bulletins, a few dozen message areas (including FidoNet), over 100 files areas
 and about a dozen doors.

 BBS Name:  Basically Computers BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 938-1201
 Sysop:  George Divens
 BBS Software:  Wildcat!
 Year Founded:  1992

 One of the more interesting options on the Basically Computers BBS is a very
 detailed statistics screen that tells everything imaginable about the usage of
 the BBS.  The board has 199 files areas (including those on the CD-ROM), five
 local message areas and no door programs.  First time callers are greeted with
 a precise welcome screen, but the standard Wildcat! log-in questionnaire is
 longer than most software packages.  The system gives the caller the option of
 viewing the newsletter, takes them through the bulletin menu (which has only
 two bulletins), before reaching the main menu.  New users do get a 30 day
 membership, with 30 minutes per day, but are expected to mail in a
 "Registration Form" for continued access.

 BBS Name:  The Big Pit BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 863-1572
 Sysop:  Ernie Stefan
 BBS Software:  PCBoard
 Year Founded:  1992

 The Big Pit BBS claims to be "Tampa Bay's Fastest Growing Bulletin Board
 Service."  The strength of this system is the use of the PCBoard PPE files and
 it even has a menu option to select different PPEs.  The use of a PPE to
 display rotating main menu screens is also a nice touch, however, the system
 does have a lot of stuff to go through before reaching the main menu.  New
 users are greeted with several informational screens, a PPE set up with what
 could best be described as junk screens, the extended PCBoard new user
 questionnaire, autopost and the quote of the day, more ads and other screens,
 and then new user must update more information before finally reaching the
 main menu.  New users do get an hour to check out the couple dozen doors, 22
 bulletins and seven file areas.  The BBS does offer adult access and a second
 phone number is available at (813) 862-9353.

 BBS Name:  Board of Trade BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 862-4772
 Sysop:  Richard Ziegler
 BBS Software:  PCBoard
 Year Founded:  1992

 This system calls itself "Pasco County's Information Source" and is the "Home
 of the Pasco BBS Magazine," among other publications.  The Board of Trade BBS
 also has the motto "Call here FIRST for the BEST in Shareware."  A single
 screen of information for the new user is followed by a standard
 questionnaire.  A statistics screen and the system news is also displayed
 prior to the main menu.  The board has 48 file areas, 25 bulletins, 11 message
 areas, five doors, one questionnaire and is a member of FidoNet.  First time
 callers have 20 minutes to look around.

 BBS Name:  Buzzard's Bay BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 868-5334
 Sysop:  Steivn Zimmerman
 BBS Software:  Excalibur
 Year Founded:  1995

 This system's use of the Excalibur BBS package requires a special terminal
 program for access.  If you are not calling with this software, the BBS will
 ask if you wish to download the necessary program, if you choose not to, you
 will have to log-off.  Whether or not this is the friendliest approach for the
 novice user could be the subject of some conjecture, but we did not take the
 time to download the software for this BBS Tour.  While a complete review is
 not really possible, the Buzzard's Bay BBS does promote itself as a file
 board.

 BBS Name:  The Cellar BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 849-2196
 Sysop:  Richard LaBreche
 BBS Software:  Maximus
 Year Founded:  1995

 First time callers are welcomed with the warning that this system uses "caller
 ID to verify new users.  This enables me to dispense with callbacks and other
 annoying stuff like that."  Caller ID is a much more favorable option to some
 of the more antiquated concepts, like voice verification, but few boards have
 the courage to admit that they use it.  This board does have a short new user
 log-on questionnaire and only a couple of rules posted before reaching the
 main menu.  The Maximus software package uses sub-areas, but there are four
 primary message areas and five file areas.  The Cellar BBS does not feature
 any bulletins, or doors, and first time callers have 30 minutes to look
 around.  We wonder if there is some water in the cellar, as the Sysop also
 goes by the handle of Hıo.

 BBS Name:  Circuit Board BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 849-1209
 Sysop:  Rob Walters
 BBS Software:  Excalibur
 Year Founded:  1995

 This is the latest rendition of the Circuit Board BBS, a system which was up
 some time ago, went down for a while and is now back on-line.  The board uses
 the Excalibur BBS package which, as noted earlier, requires a special terminal
 program for access.  This BBS was not reviewed for that reason, but is
 believed to be a general interest board.

 BBS Name:  Classified's BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 856-0744
 Sysop:  Victor Dacey
 BBS Software:  Wildcat!
 Year Founded:  1994

 The Classified's BBS specializes in ads and money making ideas, perhaps some
 would call them schemes.  This system has the standard Wildcat! new user
 questionnaire, which is longer than most BBS software packages.  There are
 several advertising screens, and the option of viewing the newsletter and the
 bulletin menu, prior to the main menu.  The board has six message areas, 30
 file areas, a dozen doors and about ten bulletins.  New users are given 30
 minutes a day for 30 days.

 BBS Name:  Dr. Duck BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 849-3562
 Sysop:  Marty Ducko
 BBS Software:  Wildcat!
 Year Founded:  1992

 After the typical Wildcat! new user questionnaire, first time callers are told
 that "use is now in restricted mode, download REGISTER.ZIP."  After going
 through the "who called today" screen, an advertising screen, the option of
 viewing the newsletter (which is a actually a BBS list), the option of going
 through the bulletin menu (which features mostly high scores for door games),
 the first time caller finds out just how restricted that use is.  With their
 ten minutes, the new user has access to one file area with a half dozen "Free
 Downloads," access to a general message conference and can see that the system
 has seven doors.

 BBS Name:  Dragon Sphere BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 938-3238
 Sysop:  Mike Ralston
 BBS Software:  TriBBS
 Year Founded:  1995

 This board has a gaming theme and features the extensive use of graphics.
 After a fairly standard new user questionnaire, first time callers are taken
 through a rather confusing "Logon Verification System," which has little
 explanation of what to do.  After going through the system news, and a
 bulletin menu with no bulletins, first time callers may find themselves at a
 main menu where no commands seem to work.  First time callers have 30 minutes,
 but may find that only the questionnaire command (with two choices) works.

 BBS Name:  Ed's BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 937-7403
 Sysop:  Ed Brown
 BBS Software:  PCBoard
 Year Founded:  1989

 While the first time caller is granted an hour, they have virtually no access
 on this board.  You cannot really see what is available and are greeted with
 "Menu Selection is not available" more than anything else.  However, we were
 able to find out that Ed's BBS has adult areas, along with FidoNet and
 Huggynet echos.  There is also a northern Pinellas County number available at
 (813) 786-1747.

 BBS Name:  The Family Affair BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 849-3949
 Sysop:  Night Forest/Moon Glow
 BBS Software:  TriBBS
 Year Founded:  1995

 This BBS has a relatively short new user questionnaire, then displays some
 statistics and the system news prior to the main menu.  Callers are told that
 "This is just a small, family operated bulletin board.  It is our hobby
 and we hope that we can share it with you!"  The system has over 60 (mostly
 FidoNet) message areas, 33 door programs, 21 file areas, eight bulletins and
 adult access.  First time callers have 45 minutes to look around.

 BBS Name:  Gator's Place BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 376-0087
 Sysop:  Gator
 BBS Software:  Virtual
 Year Founded:  1992

 The initial welcome screen claims that this is "The Place for FUN and
 Adventure!"  The system does have a short new user questionnaire, but has the
 "You must now leave feedback to the system operator" requirement.  New users
 are asked to leave a message to "tell us a little bit about yourself,
 including your hobbies and other interests.  If you do not fill this letter
 out, You WILL NOT be given file access on this board."  The first time caller
 receives 45 minutes of access.  The BBS features a couple dozen door programs,
 CD-ROMs, but no bulletins.  Gator's Place BBS message areas include
 VirtualNET, LocoNET and ConsumerNet.

 BBS Name:  Gemini Dreams BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 942-9602
 Sysop:  Jennifer Therrien
 BBS Software:  Renegade
 Year Founded:  1994

 This board has a relatively standard log-on script, but for some reason it
 asks for occupation.  There are no new user screens, but you must "send a
 new user application letter" (a message) to the system operator.  Callers are
 taken through a "last few callers" screen and the system news prior to
 reaching the main menu.  Gemini Dreams BBS has 91 file areas (including CD-
 ROM), 72 message areas (featuring AmberNet, FidoNet and RGSNet), but no
 bulletins.  There are three, mostly music related, voting booth options and
 the King of the BBS Trivia door.  First time callers are granted 45 minutes of
 access.

 BBS Name:  Ground Zero BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 849-4034
 Sysops:  Dave Anderson, Sean Fleeman
 BBS Software:  C-Net
 Year Founded:  1985

 This system, along with the Studio PC BBS, are partners in Citicom Online
 Communication Services.  Upon logging-in you are told that "You've connected
 to Tampa Bay's oldest CNet Amiga BBS."  The board does display an excessive
 number of rules for the new user and a long new user questionnaire.  The
 questionnaire goes to the extent of asking occupation, sexual preference and
 tells you how to set the correct time zone.  There is a very nice "Calendar of
 Events" and some instructional screens prior to reaching the main menu.  There
 are hundreds of message areas, including FidoNet, AmyNet, MufoNet, AmigaNet
 and Internet.  There are six bulletins, 12 main file areas with sub-areas and
 15 doors.  A Pinellas County number is available at (813) 934-9765 and voice
 support can be reached at (813) 842-5783.  First time callers have 15 minutes
 on the board.

 BBS Name:  Gumbyland BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 846-1000
 Sysop:  Gumby
 BBS Software:  Major BBS
 Year Founded:  1991

 This system was the first to provide Internet service in Pasco County and does
 some of its business under the name of Internet Network Corporation.  When
 calling the BBS, and filling out a somewhat longer than normal new user
 questionnaire, first time callers may have trouble getting to the main menu.
 After finding that the menu can be displayed through the help function, they
 will see "Sorry, you don't have access" more than anything else.  About the
 only thing a new user can see is rate information for the system.  The
 Gumbyland BBS does offer voice support at (813) 842-4444.

 BBS Name:  Information Services BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 938-4178
 Sysop:  Paul Kruschwitz
 BBS Software:  PowerAccess
 Founded:  1995

 This system asks callers if they want to download "PowerAccess for Windows,"
 but if the caller opts not to do so, the board will work using a standard
 communications program.  This board does have more than an average amount of
 instructional screens for the first time caller, as it explains different
 types of graphics modes and other configuration options.  After a typical new
 user log-on questionnaire, there is another questionnaire for new users, but
 the first time caller does get 90 minutes on the board for two weeks.  The BBS
 features 31 forums, a couple dozen file areas (including CD-ROMs), three
 questionnaires and no game doors.  They advertise "Adult Entertainment" and
 offer voice support in the evening and on weekends at (813) 938-6826.  We
 would have thought that a BBS that takes the name Information Services would
 have more than three bulletins.

 BBS Name:  Inner Sanctum BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 848-6055
 Sysop:  Rob Marlowe
 BBS Software:  TBBS
 Year Founded:  1985

 The Inner Sanctum BBS is Pasco County's oldest bulletin board and was the
 first to celebrate a tenth anniversary.  After filling out a rather standard
 new user questionnaire, the first time caller is granted "Guest Status" for a
 30 day trail membership, which allows 20 minutes a day.  The system does not
 display a lot of rules, and only the system news, prior to reaching the main
 menu.  There are 16 primary files areas (including CD-ROMs), several dozen
 game doors, 16 bulletins, a dozen local message areas (and hundreds of network
 areas) and two voting booth options.  An interesting feature is "Business
 Central," where business information can be found.  The Inner Sanctum BBS, a
 popular chat board, also features Internet and has a voice support number at
 (813) 845-0893.

 BBS Name:  Lunatic's Lore BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 942-0143
 Sysop:  Lunatic Rick
 BBS Software:  PCBoard
 Year Founded:  1995

 This is a fairly new system, so do not be surprised if you see "Under
 Construction" in some areas.  The new user screen may be the shortest in Pasco
 County, which is followed by a standard PCBoard new user questionnaire.  After
 filling out the questionnaire, you are notified that you are an "Official
 Lunatic."  There is a screen that states "CyberSpace the Final Frontier!  To
 carelessly go where no one normal has gone before," followed by the quote of
 the day and the system news (which is as much jokes as it is news), before
 reaching the main menu.  The board features one message area called the "Loony
 Bin," four bulletins, eight file areas, ten doors and two questionnaires.
 There is a PCBoard PPE program that rotates the main menu screen, but
 excessive typing at the bottom ruins the effect.  First time callers have 60
 minutes to look around.

 BBS Name:  MacHighway BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 372-6900
 Sysop:  Bettie Donavan
 BBS Software:  NovaServer
 Year Founded:  1995

 This system is dedicated to the Macintosh computer user, but may be called by
 any standard communications program.  It is one of the few hobby boards that
 allows "Guest Accounts," which means someone can log-in and look around
 without giving their name.  The system has a standard new user log-on
 questionnaire, then forces the first time caller through a short three
 question survey.  The MacHighway BBS features a local message area, Internet
 mail, five bulletins and no doors programs.  There are two file areas,
 "Macintosh Files" and "PC Files."

 BBS Name:  Mystique BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 856-9681
 Sysop:  Larry Pytlak
 BBS Software:  PowerAccess
 Year Founded:  1995

 The PowerAccess software package gives callers the option of downloading a
 special Windows terminal program, or using their favorite communications
 software.  The Mystique BBS has a standard new user log-on script, takes the
 first time caller through another questionnaire after that, and is one of the
 few remaining systems that verifies each new user by voice.  The board claims
 they "will provide you with MYSTIC Entertainment!  Programs include your Daily
 Horoscope, Astrology and a variety of related topics."  However, none of this
 is really apparent to the first time caller using their 20 minutes of access.
 The board has seven CD-ROMs, 15 message areas, two bulletins, two
 questionnaires and Internet.  Voice support is available at (813) 856-4841 and
 a second line can be reached at (813) 856-6165.

 BBS Name:  NaVain BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 372-0924
 Sysop:  Night Owl
 BBS Software:  C-Net
 Year Founded:  1995

 The welcome screen for the NaVain BBS proclaims "Welcome to The Freedom of
 Speech BBS."  The system has a rather long new user questionnaire, which has
 several questions on the caller's terminal setup.  The questionnaire also asks
 for your occupation and inquires about "other interests."  After going through
 the system news callers reach the main menu.  The board has 14 message areas,
 several doors, seven file areas and two voting booth options.  First time
 callers have 30 minutes and a second line is available at (813) 372-7532.

 BBS Name:  The One Stop BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 857-1066
 Sysop:  Ken
 BBS Software:  Major BBS
 Year Founded:  1995

 After going through a fairly standard new user questionnaire, even if it is a
 little bit longer than some, users will reach the main menu.  The menu is very
 colorful, but does display painfully slow at lower baud rates.  New users are
 granted 60 minutes of access, but cannot access any of the BBS commands.
 About all the first time caller can do is get some basic command information
 and find out that the board has adult areas.

 BBS Name:  Outer Limits BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 942-0722
 Sysop:  Paul Filippone
 BBS Software:  TriBBS
 Year Founded:  1994

 On the plus side, this system has a short log-on questionnaire for new users
 and no new user screens.  On the negative side, callers have to go through the
 "Graffiti Wall," a couple of screens of statistics, some other junk screens
 and the bulletin menu before reaching the main menu.  This board gives the
 first time caller 20 minutes, until they take a new user questionnaire, then
 they are granted two hours of access.  The Outer Limits BBS has 80 file areas
 (including the CD-ROM), two message areas, two bulletins, two questionnaires
 and three door games.  The Sysop goes by the handle of Renegade.

 BBS Name:  The Personals BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 857-9181
 Sysop:  Rene Zagorianos
 BBS Software:  Oreacomm
 Year Founded:  1995

 This system advertises itself as "an all new adult bulletin board where
 romance comes alive with excitement for all lifestyles.  A confidential fun
 way to meet someone special in the comfort of your home - safely, discretely,
 anonymously."  First time users are taken through a disclaimer screen, which
 tries to insure that callers are over 21 years of age and aware of the
 material which may be found on the system.  That screen also states that "this
 is a commercial enterprise."  The "hang-up" option was selected at this point.

 BBS Name:  Piranha BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 856-0892
 Sysop:  Captian Hood
 BBS Software:  PCBoard
 Year Founded:  1995

 The Piranha BBS caters to people who are ANSI artists and the Sysop attempts
 to verify that every caller is involved in the art world.  The system probably
 presents more graphic screens than any other BBS in Pasco County.  The new
 user questionnaire is pretty standard, but does feature a slick graphic
 displaying the percentage of the questionnaire completed.  Callers are taken
 through a last callers screen and "one-liners" prior to reaching the main
 menu.  The board has 27 file areas and first time callers are given 50
 minutes.

 BBS Name:  Planet Alderaan BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 934-7881
 Sysop:  Dale Hutchinson
 BBS Software:  PCBoard
 Year Founded:  1992

 The Planet Alderaan BBS has used some PCBoard PPE programs, and some nice
 graphics, to dress up this board with a space theme.  First time callers have
 a fairly standard questionnaire to complete, along with two screens of rules.
 Callers are taken through the system news (which is very nicely done in full
 color), a last callers screen and statistics screen prior to reaching the main
 menu.  The board features over 200 message areas with FidoNet, HuggyNet,
 SWNETII (Swingers Net II) and USNetMail.  There are also dozens of bulletins,
 about 40 doors, 14 main file areas, CD-ROMs, adult areas and Internet.  A
 second line is available at (813) 942-6070.

 BBS Name:  Purple Rose of Cario BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 842-1835
 Sysop:  Rob Flor
 BBS Software:  Wildcat!
 Year Founded:  1995

 As is typical of Wildcat! systems, this board's new caller questionnaire may
 be a bit longer than average.  Callers are taken through a "Today's callers"
 screen, the high scores for selected door games and another advertising screen
 prior to reaching the main menu.  The Purple Rose of Cario BBS features 54
 message areas (including the Tavernlink network), 21 file areas, about a dozen
 bulletins and dozens of doors.  The board also features one questionnaire
 asking "How are we doing?"

 BBS Name:  Red Dwarf BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 844-3087
 Sysop:  Dave Lister
 BBS Software:  TriBBS
 Year Founded:  1991

 The Red Dwarf BBS appears to be the former Luddite BBS, which was started in
 1991 by Tony Evans.  While this board may have a new name, and a different
 name for the Sysop, it does retain the Luddite's telephone number.  This
 system greets first time callers with a standard log-on questionnaire and a
 few more rules than the average system.  One rule is the somewhat antiquated
 "Remember you are a guest here so please act accordingly."  After going
 through a screen that display the days remaining in the Clinton
 Administration, and a statistics screen, new users reach the main menu with 45
 minutes to check things out.  The board features 18 bulletins, a few dozen
 doors, 17 file areas (they also have a CD-ROM) and 23 message areas (including
 some FidoNet echos).  There are also two questionnaires, one is called
 "Mandatory Questionnaire" and the other is used to upgrade the security level
 of new users.

 BBS Name:  Schematic BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 372-9524
 Sysop:  Joseph McQuade
 BBS Software:  PCBoard
 Year Founded:  1995

 This is a new board and the system news advises "Please be patient, this
 bulletin board is currently under construction."  There is a short new user
 screen and the standard PCBoard questionnaire before reaching the main menu.
 The Schematic BBS uses a PCBoard PPE program to rotate different main menu
 screens, but excessive writing at the bottom of the menu ruins the effect.
 There are eight file directories, three message areas, two questionnaires, two
 bulletins, but no doors were operational at the time of log-in.  First time
 callers have 60 minutes on the board.

 BBS Name:  The Screaming Cow BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 842-3311
 Sysop:  Doctor John
 BBS Software:  Searchlight
 Year Founded:  1995

 Keeping with the unusual name of the board, The Screaming Cow BBS displays
 "MOOving along in '95' towards UTTER perfection" on its welcome screen.  The
 system has a short questionnaire and one screen of rules for new users.
 However, there is some advertising before reaching the main menu.  The board
 has four bulletins, a couple dozen file areas, four message areas and adult
 areas.  New users are given 15 minutes per call, or 30 minutes a day, to check
 out the system.

 BBS Name:  Scorpion's Den BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 845-5734
 Sysop:  Scorpio
 BBS Software:  Wildcat!
 Year Founded:  1995

 After a standard Wildcat! new user questionnaire, callers go through several
 informational screens, and the option of viewing the system news and bulletin
 menu, prior to the main menu.  Scorpion's Den BBS is a member of FidoNet, but
 has only two message areas.  There are 64 file areas, 49 doors and three
 bulletins.  First time callers are given 60 minutes of access and a second
 line is available at (813) 849-7631.

 BBS Name:  The Silicon Lab BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 869-3700
 Sysop:  Herb Mellinger
 BBS Software:  GAP
 Year Founded:  1986

 This system has been up under different names over the years.  When logging in
 you will be quickly notified that this is "A Closed BBS for Seniors and GAP
 Sysops" and that the board is "structured for and dedicated to Seniors and
 Retirees."  This system is not one of the friendliest you'll come across, just
 sample a couple of extractions from the numerous screens of rules.
 "WARNING!!!  After a bogus name call I need only pick up the line and enter
 *57 to start the trace on the call.  Since I keep a file of all logins and
 their times, prosecution of these calls are a snap."  Or, "We consider access
 to this BBS as an extension of our home.  We do NOT tell others how to run
 their home and do not accept others telling us how to run ours."  No attempt
 was made to gather further information.

 BBS Name:  The Special Place BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 372-7525
 Sysop:  Bob Dipalma
 BBS Software:  Remote Access
 Year Founded:  1991

 Before giving any log-on information, this BBS advises that "We Cater to Gays
 and Lesbians but everyone is welcomed.  If this offends you, please hang up
 now."  The Special Place BBS has a new user questionnaire that is more
 personal that most, asking such questions as "Do you have a lover or spouse
 and for how long?" and "Describe yourself and looks."  The two node system has
 some FidoNet echos and first time callers are given 20 minutes to look around.

 BBS Name:  The Storm's Fury BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 843-8905
 Sysop:  Matt Holden
 BBS Software:  Virtual
 Year Founded:  1993

 The Storm's Fury BBS advertises "The Most Doors on Any BBS in Pasco County,"
 and has 166 doors on the system.  New users have a short log-on questionnaire
 to complete, and a screen of rules for first time callers, before going
 through autopost prior to reaching the main menu.  First time callers have 30
 minutes to look around.  The board has 21 primary file areas, but also offers
 CD-ROMs.  The BBS states that it is an "Official Distribution Site for
 seventy-eight software companies."  The welcome screen has quite a few message
 networks listed, FidoNet, VirtualNET, CrystalNET, CellNET, AuthorLink,
 AllNighter, KargoNET, SpectraNET and DianondNET, however, a good percentage of
 these are local networks with little activity.  The Storm's Fury BBS has five
 bulletins, a second line available at (813) 849-2272 and a Sysop who uses the
 handle of Thunder.

 BBS Name:  Studio PC BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 849-4034
 Sysop:  Ralph Lobianco
 BBS Software:  PCBoard
 Year Founded:  1986

 The Studio PC BBS, along with the Ground Zero BBS, make up Citicom Online
 Communication Services.  This system was once known as Studio 64, when it was
 based on a Commodore computer.  First time callers are presented with a couple
 of screens of rules and a standard PCBoard new user questionnaire.  There is a
 "Quote of the Call" screen, a statistics screen and the system news prior to
 reaching the main menu.  The board has over 700 message areas (including
 FidoNet, Clink, Mufonet, K12 Information Freeway and Internet), over 700 file
 areas, 25 bulletins, over a dozen doors, three questionnaires and over a dozen
 different voting booth options.  First time callers receive a 30 day
 membership with 45 minutes a day to check out the board.  There is a Pinellas
 County number at (813) 934-9765 and voice support can be reached at (813) 842-
 5783.

 BBS Name:  Treasure Isle BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 847-5317
 Sysop:  Gopher
 BBS Software:  Virtual
 Year Founded:  1993

 The Treasure Isle BBS has a typical new user questionnaire, then takes callers
 through a statistics screen, a "Today in History" screen and auto-post prior
 to reaching the main menu.  The message areas feature VirtualNet, LocoNet,
 ConsumerNet, HOGnet and FidoNet.  There are a couple of file areas, 16 game
 doors and three bulletins.  A Voting Booth option has six choices including
 "What Do You Think Of Pasco County?"  First time callers have 20 minutes to
 check out the system.

 Sysop:  David Zimmer
 BBS Software:  TriBBS
 Year Founded:  1993

 The Traveling Man BBS has a short new user questionnaire, which asks only
 pertinent questions.  However, callers are taken through several advertising
 screens, the system news and the bulletin menu prior to reaching the main
 menu.  The board has 77 message areas featuring TriBBSNET and WME.  There are
 13 files areas, including a CD-ROM, and a File Request Door.  First time
 callers are given 30 minutes.

 Sysop:  William Begley
 BBS Software:  TriBBS
 Year Founded:  1993

 When you log into the Twilight Zone BBS you have 20 different language files
 to choose from.  First time callers are greeted with a couple of screens of
 rules, but are told ""This BBS is my hobby and yours to enjoy."  A friendly
 touch is the listing of 'Mom' as Co-Sysop.  The BBS has a standard new user
 questionnaire, but does take the caller through the high scores for door
 games, an advertising screen, the system news, the last ten callers screen and
 the bulletin menu prior to the main menu.  There are 123 message areas,
 featuring FidoNet, COM-X and CLink.  The Twilight Zone BBS has 13 bulletins,
 one questionnaire for visiting Sysops, 54 doors and over 70 file areas

 reaching the main menu.  There are three bulletins, two message areas (General
 Chat and Pets), 14 game doors and one file area called "Downloads."  The first

 BBS Name:  Zombie Zone BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 376-6136
 Sysop:  Zombie Mambo
 BBS Software:  Synchronet
 Year Founded:  1995

 This board has a longer than usual new user questionnaire, along with the
 requirement of sending a message to the Sysop.  There are several screens to
 go through, using quite a bit of graphics, so it does take some time to get to
 the main menu.  Unfortunately, this system has needless obscenities displayed
 in the new user screen, among other places.  Zombie Zone BBS features ten
 bulletins, five message areas, 13 file areas, a couple dozen doors and adult
 access.  New users are given 30 minutes on the system.

 BBS Name:  The Zoo BBS
 Telephone Number:  (813) 841-9316
 Sysop:  Goldfinger
 BBS Software:  T.A.G.

 This system has a slightly longer new user log-on questionnaire than average,
 which is followed by another short questionnaire.  Callers are taken through a
 last callers screen, advertising screens, a disclaimer, some rules, a
 statistics screen and auto-message prior to reaching the main menu.  The Zoo
 BBS uses a call back verifier, or other forms of validation, so the first time
 caller has little to see in their 15 minute allotment.  The new user may
 frequently see "Sorry You do NOT have access to this area.  Use the Call-Back
 Verifier or wait to be validated."  The system does have 12 bulletins (which
 are mostly high scores for game doors), a CD-ROM and is a member of FidoNet.

 Epilogue:  Next month's issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine will feature a follow
 up report to the Pasco BBS Tour.  We will take a look at how the Pasco County
 BBS community has evolved over the past several years.  A comparison on how
 things have changed, since the first issue of this publication in January
 1993, should produce some interesting findings.  Look for a future issue to
 cover east Pasco County systems.

 Jazz Jackrabbit Review
 ----------------------

 Written by Paul Pollack, editor GamePlay Magazine, New Port Richey, FL

 In this review I'll take a look at Epic's hot new game, Jazz Jackrabbit.  So
 read on and hear what's so special about this game.

 As I finished writing this review, I realized that reviewing shareware games
 is sort of unusual in the fact that shareware games are supposed to be try
 before you buy.  So you could make a case that shareware games let the user
 "review" the game himself before buying the full version.  What the purpose of
 this review is, is to give you my thoughts on the game before (or after) you
 download it.  Let's get started.

 Game:  Jazz Jackrabbit
 Developer/Publisher:  Epic MegaGames
 Overall rating:  B

 Rating scale (like a report-card):

 A+ -- Mega-awesome
 A  -- Awesome
 B+ -- Great
 B  -- Really good
 C+ -- Good
 C  -- Average
 D+ -- OK
 D  -- Fair
 F+ -- Better than nothing...
 F  -- Stinks!

 Categories:

 Graphics:  How good are the graphics compared to your computer's maximum
 capacity available for the graphics?

 Sound:  Are the bleeps and bloops good, or are they really just bleeps and
 bloops?

 Music:  Will you be humming the theme song later, or will you be trying to get
 it out of your head?

 Technical Problems:  Did I spend more time getting the game to work right than
 I did playing it?

 Plot:  Does the plot remind you of Willy Beamish, or King's Quest VI?

 Fun-factor:  Is the game fun enough to even have a Replay factor?

 Replay factor:  Does winning the first time through make you want to replay
 it, or store it?

 Control\manipulation:  Can you do what you want to do without hassles or too
 much tediousness?

 Concept:  Is the main idea of what kind of game your dealing with sound good
 to you?

 Combined realism:  All together, how realistic was it.  Did it manage to pull
 you into its virtual world?

 Overall:  Put all these factors together, and what do you get?

 Worth registering/buying:  After playing, did I want to send the programmer
 money, or did I think he should have to send me money?

 Explanation:

 Graphics (A+):  The graphics were very nicely done, but it was hard to rate
 them since there's really not many other games for the PC in this genre other
 than Zool.  If I was comparing it to Zool, I'd say that Jazz was far superior
 with three different levels of graphic detail, and more animation.  On the
 highest level, the sun that was perpetually in the upper-right hand corner got
 to me, and I turned down the detail level to take out the sun.  Let me just
 put it to you this way.  If you can stand Sonic, you can stand Jazz.

 Sound (B+):  The sound was another area where Jazz Jackrabbit did pretty well.
 All the sounds in the game sounded exactly as they should, and different
 levels of sound quality let you fine-tune the sound for your computer.  On a
 486-33 the sound should be fine, but for true "Ultra-quality" you need a
 Pentium.  I also noticed that none of the sounds were "borrowed" from other
 Epic games and were completely original (as far as I can tell).

 Music (A):  The music for the game was great and fit the game well.  It never
 became overly repetitive or annoying, and just seemed to go well with the
 game.

 Technical Problems (A):  There were no glaring technical problems in Jazz
 Jackrabbit.  I didn't get any "Out of hunk" or "Not enough memory" messages
 while running the game.  In fact, the only technical fault is the sound.  To
 get ultra-quality you need at least a Pentium machine, and on a 486-25 some
 people think that the sound is "tinny."  If you have anything above a high-end
 386, you should be able to run Jazz at a nice and satisfying frame rate,
 although you may have to sacrifice sound quality.  The sound's not really bad,
 even on the lowest level though, and doesn't really detract from the overall
 value of the program.  In fact, I really couldn't tell much of a difference in
 sound quality from "high-quality" to "medium-quality."

 Plot (C+):  OK.  Here's the plot. You are a young jackrabbit known
 appropriately as Jazz Jackrabbit.  You are out to save princess Earlong.
 Sound familiar?  It's the same old save the princess from the evil
 person/animal (in this case, turtle).  It's not really a bad plot, though, and
 since it isn't a graphic adventure the plot isn't the main focus of the game.

 Fun-factor (B+):  The game was pretty fun to play while it lasted (7 levels)
 and never really got too repetitive.  There were a variety of weapons to
 choose from, and the graphics changed depending on what world you were in.
 The gameplay was fresh and exciting each new level, and there were some
 secrets thrown in every level (more on that in Replay Value).

 Replay value (B):  I've always liked Sonic games, and Jazz Jackrabbit is, for
 all intensive purposes, a Sonic clone.  To tell you the truth: After beating
 Jazz Jackrabbit, I really didn't have the urge to play it all over again.
 Many people do play it all over again, if only for all the secrets Epic has
 put into the game (the bird you can get to help you each level, the racetrack,
 the extra lives, the secret levels, etc.).  It depends on what you like.  If
 you really like Sonic-type action you may replay this a lot.  If you're only a
 casual fan, you may not after beating it.

 Control/manipulation (A):  The game's controls were easy to learn and to use,
 and even novices should have no problem getting into the game.  Another option
 is the joystick support, which worked fine on my standard analog joystick.  If
 you really want the control to shine, check out the game on a Gravis PC
 Gamepad!

 Concept (C+):  Face it, folks. Jazz Jackrabbit is basically a Sonic the
 Hedgehog clone.  A good looking clone, but still a clone.  Many of the
 graphics, such as him standing unbalanced when he reached the end of a cliff,
 were borrowed directly from Sonic.  Even the racetrack reminded me of
 something from Sonic II.  Face it, it's not that original and when combined
 with the only mediocre plot, is only slightly above average.  It really
 doesn't hurt the game that much, though, since the rest of the game is so
 good!

 Combined realism (N/A):  OK.  You control a drawn Jazz Jackrabbit, a
 jackrabbit trying to save princess Earlong, who, not coincidentally, is also a
 jackrabbit.  Both characters are made not to look realistic at all, but rather
 to give a cartoonish feel.  Thus, you really can't assign a realism value when
 there really wasn't meant to be any.

 Worth Registering/Buying (B):  Whether you buy the game or not hinges on one
 simple question?  Do you like Sonic the Hedgehog?  Even if the answer is yes,
 Jazz Jackrabbit still might not be right for you.  If you own a Sega, there
 are tons of games out there like this, with just as well-done graphics and
 sound.  To register for episodes 1, 2, and 3 of Jazz, it'll cost $25 dollars.
 For episodes 4, 5, and 6, it'll be another $25 dollars.  All together, getting
 the full Jazz Jackrabbit costs more than registering Doom, or buying TIE
 Fighter!  Whether it's worth it for a simple arcade/action game is up to you.

 Overall (B):  Jazz Jackrabbit, while not the perfect game, is certainly worth
 a try.  Whether you have none or a million Sonic clones, there's no denying
 Jazz's great graphics, sound, animation and control.  This is one of the
 better PC arcade/action games out there, and to those who've never played a
 Sonic clone, I recommend it wholeheartedly.  Whether you like Sonic the
 Hedgehog or not, Jazz Jackrabbit is definitely worth a download, and some of
 your time.

 With the November 28th announcement of a new 561 area code, Florida will have
 double the number of area codes it had about a year ago.  Beginning in April,
 Palm Beach, Martin, Saint Lucie and Indian River counties will make up the new
 561 area code.  These counties are currently part of the 407 area, which is
 expected to split again in 1997.  This will make eight area codes in the
 state, up from four just over a year ago.  The demand for additional phone
 numbers, brought about by the public's desire for electronic gadgets, has
 created this wave of area code splits.  The Tampa Bay area's 813 area code,
 which spilt earlier this year, is now expected to fulfill demand until the
 year 2012.

 MS-DOS 99.3

 Welcome to your new, simplified MS-DOS manual!

 Thank you for choosing MS-DOS 99.3!  You have wisely purchased an operating
 system that has made Bill Gates rich and will continue to make him even
 richer.  He'd thank you personally but he's sailing in the Bahamas on his new
 yacht, surrounded by beautiful money-hungry women, and doesn't have time
 to write anything in this introduction.

 Note that the warranty on the enclosed disks becomes null and void if they are
 placed within five (5) feet of a computer while the packaging is removed.
 Whatever you do, DO NOT INSERT THESE DISKS INTO YOUR COMPUTER!

 If you have elected to ignore our standard warranty disclaimer, these steps
 should be followed.  (Please note that MS-DOS is no longer under warranty once
 the package seal has been broken, and all steps are followed at your own
 risk.)

 Step 1:

 Open the disk packages and remove the disks.

 Step 2:

 Insert them into your computer one at a time while the computer is switched
 on.

 Step 3:

 Type [install] while praying really, really hard that this upgrade will not
 affect any of the important programs you already have installed on your
 current MS-DOS system.

 Step 4:

 If the installation is unsuccessful, do not - we repeat DO NOT - call the MS
 Support Line.  You have already voided the warranty by removing the disks
 from the packaging and we really don't care if you have lost many megs of
 valuable and irreplaceable information.  Perhaps our next upgrade will work
 better... who knows?

 PBM Flashback - January 1994
 ----------------------------

 The first anniversary issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine had a very special
 interview with British Shareware author Graham Cluley.  He is the author of
 the adventure games Humbug and Jacaranda Jim, and the arcade-style games Blox
 and Wilf.  If you enjoy British humor, you may want to go back to that
 interview two years ago, as it was quite delightful.  Here is some of what
 Graham Cluley said about the British Shareware industry in the January 1994
 issue.

 "British Shareware has never been as organized as USA Shareware.  From
 discussions I've had with UK authors I seem to be about the only chap who has
 had any real success in selling their software.  I think that is largely down
 to a knowledge of how to market the games best.  If you can't present the
 games properly and put them in front of the end-user, they'll never register
 them.  Also, you must have a good reason to register the games.  Otherwise,
 people's natural reaction will be that they won't bother."

 Editor's Note:  PBM Flashback will appear on a regular basis in future issues.
 Most issues will have this brief look back at some of the features which have
 appeared over the history of the Pasco BBS Magazine.

 Next Month
 ----------

 The February issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine will have more on the Pasco
 County BBS community.  We will take a look at how things have changed over the
 last few years.  A quick comparison could provide some interesting findings.
 It could even be possible that Pasco BBS Tour will generate some rebuttals
 from local Sysops.  While it will be hard to top the Pasco BBS Tour, it will
 be another informative issue.

 The February issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine will be available on, or before,
 January 22.  Do not miss an exciting issue of Tampa Bay's oldest free on-line
 magazine!
