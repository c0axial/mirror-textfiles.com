 Editor's Welcome
 ----------------

 It happened!  The ONE BBSCON came to Tampa!  It is still hard to believe that
 the ultimate on-line convention was held right here in Tampa Bay.  It was a
 lot of fun and those who opted not to attend really missed a golden
 opportunity.  Who knows if the event will ever come back to this area.  Next
 year's BBSCON will be held a bit further away, in San Francisco.  There is a
 short article called ONE BBSCON '95 First Impressions in this issue, but time
 only permitted a few paragraphs to be written before the deadline for
 publication.  Next month's issue will feature full coverage of this historic
 event for the Tampa Bay area on-line community.

 The ONE BBSCON was not the only interesting occurrence since the last issue.
 In this very active hurricane season, Hurricane Erin tracked across Pasco
 County.  While Erin was downgraded to a rather intense tropical storm before
 the storm center went through our county, it still was the first storm to pass
 through here in decades.  And, let's hope it is that long before another comes
 our way.  This issue looks at the on-line activity generated by Hurricane
 Erin, as many people went on-line to get the latest on the storm, in an
 article entitled Hurricane Erin:  CyberStorm.

 This month's issue has The Catalog of Free On-Line Magazines, which gives a
 bit of publicity to some of our competitors.  Paul Pollack writes about "BBSs,
 Shareware, the Internet, the Media and Censorship."  Thanks go out to Paul for
 another interesting article.  There are also reviews, humor, more of our
 Favorite Taglines and much more.  I hope you enjoy this month's issue and do
 not miss next month's Pasco BBS Magazine, as we continue the most
 comprehensive coverage of ONE BBSCON '95 found anywhere!

 Until next month, thanks for reading!

 ONE BBSCON '95 First Impressions
 --------------------------------

 ONE BBSCON '95 closed Sunday in Tampa.  There are so many stories to relate,
 so many people to quote and so much to write about, that I wish this article
 could be a complete report.  The past couple of years, the September issue was
 released prior to the BBSCON, so that allowed plenty of time for full coverage
 in the October issue.  This year the full coverage will also have to wait
 until October's issue, but I wanted to give you just a taste of what went down
 in Tampa.  This article is sort of a preview of next month's complete coverage
 of ONE BBSCON '95.

 First Impression:  Hot!  It was warm to say the least.  Many were talking
 about how hot it was down in Tampa, but some Northerners did say that they had
 become more accustom to the heat because of the record high temperatures
 posted around the country this summer.  Many were heard to say they thought
 that Tampa was a wonderful and beautiful place, however, some were talking
 about how Tampa was a hick town where they rolled up the sidewalks at 6:00 pm.
 The editor of the Pasco BBS Magazine asked many of the attendees how they
 liked Tampa, so that could even appear as a separate article in next month's
 issue.

 The Welcoming Reception on the Tampa Convention Center's river-walk was
 wonderful.  It actually featured the best food of the convention and it was a
 pleasant night.  A bit humid, but at least no rain.  The Welcoming Session on
 Thursday morning was like a rock concert, complete with the laser light show.
 A record number of educational sessions and vendor exhibits took place in the
 traditional BBSCON precision.  There was plenty of conversation, networking
 and fun.

 There was talk, that will be elaborated on next month, of how the fact that
 Tampa was out of the way for most people caused a leveling off in the
 attendance.  About 4,000 attended ONE BBSCON '95, about the same number as
 last year.  The attendance had just about doubled each of the first three
 years.  Event organizers do not think that will be a problem when San
 Francisco hosts ONE BBSCON '96 on August 3-7, 1996.

 Information overload may be the buzz word for those returning home from the
 Tampa BBSCON.  I will try to sort through all the literature, disks and tapes;
 and try to put together something coherent for next month's issue.  Look for
 the October issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine for more of the most comprehensive
 coverage of ONE BBSCON '95 found anywhere.

 Hurricane Erin:  CyberStorm
 ---------------------------

 Hurricane Erin was no Andrew, but its trek through Florida was historic for
 many reasons.  Erin was the first storm center to track across Pasco County in
 over 30 years, the first hurricane to landfall in Pensacola in almost 70 years
 and the first hurricane to hit Florida twice in over 50 years.  But, it was a
 nation's quest for information about the storm that caused Hurricane Erin to
 be called the first "CyberStorm."

 This has been the most active hurricane season in three decades and two
 hurricanes have already made landfall in Florida.  Hurricane Allison went
 ashore at St. Marks on June 5, the earliest hurricane to ever hit the Sunshine
 State.  Hurricane Erin first made landfall in the early morning hours of
 August 2 at Vero Beach, but the damage was not as bad as initially feared.
 Erin then raced across the state that Wednesday exiting Florida just north of
 the Tampa Bay area causing minimal damage.  Erin then surprised the Florida
 panhandle by slamming into Pensacola on the morning of August 3 causing
 substantial damage.  Damage estimates from Hurricane Erin topped $300 million.

 The majority of people still rely upon the traditional methods for getting
 the latest weather updates, such as the local media and cable television's The
 Weather Channel.  However, people from all over the country turned to the
 newer on-line technology to get the latest on Hurricane Erin.  Maybe they
 wanted to get information because they could not reach relatives in Florida by
 telephone.  Perhaps, the comfort of exchanging e-mail and chatting with family
 and friends in the besieged state was what some were looking for.  Maybe some
 did not have cable television, or lived in a part of the country where the
 local media was not covering the storm as intensely as the media in Florida.
 Whatever the reason, going on-line was a valuable source of information and
 may have made Hurricane Erin the most talked about hurricane in history.

 Weather related Internet World Wide Web home pages were jammed.  Some of the
 more popular sites were almost impossible to access due to the volume of
 callers trying to get the latest on Erin.  The most active site was the
 National Hurricane Center's home page.  If you were lucky enough to get
 through, there were updates on Erin's position, path and strength, along with
 satellite images of the storm.  When the overload threatened the system and
 possibly the computers needed to monitor the storm, the NHC had to shut down
 the Internet site.  Other sites, such as the home page for Ohio State
 University's atmospheric science program, also were down for a while from
 overuse.

 Other popular World Wide Web home pages included the National Weather Service,
 the Weather Information Superhighway (which is the National Weather Service's
 Tallahassee office), the Federal Emergency Management Agency and numerous
 universities.  Despite the fact that The Weather Channel was broadcasting the
 latest information on Erin approximately every ten minutes on cable tv, their
 WWW home page was also very active.  All the major commercial on-line services
 also got into the act.  America On-Line had special message boards and chat
 rooms dedicated to the storm.  Tampa Bay Online, an area on Prodigy operated
 by the Tampa Tribune, had a special chat room set-up and staff answered
 questions throughout the storm.

 While it may be easier to monitor The Weather Channel for the latest
 information, on-line proved to be a valuable source of information.  Noted
 hurricane forecaster Dr. William Gray, a professor at Colorado State
 University, has revised his forecast for this season up to 16 named storms and
 9 hurricanes.  Without a doubt, Hurricane Erin will not be the last
 CyberStorm.

 The Catalog of Free On-Line Magazines
 -------------------------------------

 Trying to compile a catalog of free on-line magazines is an impossible task.
 New ones are published every month and others fall by the wayside after a few
 issues.  There are hundreds of on-line publications that live in relative
 obscurity, due to the fact that the magazines are not actively marketed.
 There are others that have done fairly well and have been around for years.
 This article originally had the working title of "The Complete Catalog of On-
 Line Magazines" but, after realizing that it was infeasible to list every on-
 line publication, the complete was dropped from the title.  It is possible
 that this may be the most comprehensive listing of on-line magazine ever
 compiled, but it is far from a complete listing.

 The criterion for a magazine to be listed in this catalog was not very strict.
 It had to be a free electronic publication and had to be published at least
 twice.  Since this is a BBS magazine, the publication had to have some sort of
 distribution through bulletin boards.  This does not mean that the editor has
 to be a Sysop, or that the magazine must have a home board, just that the
 magazine was commonly found on BBSs.  Since this catalog was intended to list
 magazines which might be of interest to a large group of readers, the
 publication had to be more than a glorified ad for a particular system, or
 software.  Unfortunately, many intriguing sounding magazines were downloaded,
 then quickly deleted when they were discovered to be just blatant ads for a
 particular board or product.

 Some other magazines, which may have met the loose criterion, did not make
 this catalog for different reasons.  Some did not make the catalog because
 they required additional files, or had hefty hardware requirements, which made
 the publication more of a hassle than it was worth.  Some editors are more
 fascinated with technology than making their publications easy to read.  No
 matter what type of gizmos are used to display on-line magazines, there should
 still be a way for someone to read the text using a simple file viewer.  The
 same goes for rude, user unfriendly BBSs.  If the home board is structured in
 such a way as to make it difficult to get information about the publication,
 there was no option but to exclude the publication from this article.  If a
 guy who runs a BBS as a hobby cannot figure out how to get around the home
 board, I'd say that alone is reason enough to not list the publication here.

 This article tries to list the as many magazines as possible, but it is
 realized that many have been missed.  If you know of other publications, or
 have additional information on those listed here, it would be greatly
 appreciated if you got in touch.  Hopefully, in the future, the Pasco BBS
 Magazine will again run a catalog of free on-line magazines.  Maybe at that
 time we will feel more comfortable putting the word complete in the title.

 Random Access Humor was a monthly humor magazine published ten times a year,
 as there was no July or August issues.  Editor Dave Bealer described RAH in
 the first issue as "a rag-tag collection of fugitive humor, some of which is
 vaguely related to the BBS/Online System world."  The magazine became fairly
 well known and in August of 1994 Robert Hankins put out a parody called "HAR -
 -- Humor Accidentally Read."   After publishing Random Access Humor for over
 two years, Dave Bealer decided to try his luck with a subscription magazine.

 BBSs, Shareware, the Internet, the Media and Censorship
 -------------------------------------------------------

 Written by Paul Pollack, editor GamePlay Magazine, New Port Richey, FL

 I'm a big fan of the shareware concept; after all, where else can you find a
 seemingly never-ending stream of software packages without having to shell out
 an equivalently never-ending stream of money?  And if you're not satisfied
 with a shareware program, you've neither gained nor lost anything, except
 perhaps a tiny amount of time.  The whole concept seems like a fine idea to
 me, and I'm sure to many others.

 But shareware's gotten a bad reputation in the press today, especially with
 today's fear of viruses (virii?) running rampant throughout American
 civilization.  The places carrying the shareware, Bulletin Board Services,
 haven't exactly been treated that well either.

 Even though much of the publicity has subsided, you can't help hearing about
 all the bad things that are "happening" on BBS's -- child pornography, easy
 access to adult materials, child-molesting sysops, etc.  But what they fail to
 point, and this is what upsets me, is that these things don't happen on every
 BBS -- far from it...  In fact, never once have I ever called a board with any
 of the forementioned problems, and yet we never hear that pointed out on
 television.  All you see on television are reporters sitting down at a
 computer, calling a "sex web site" and then saying something like "Isn't this
 absurd?"  They then follow with an incredibly stupid line like "You mean it's
 this easy?  Would you want your child to have access to something like this?!"
 Of course, they conveniently fail to point out that you don't just stumble
 onto something like this, you have to be looking.  Besides, if kids would
 visit these sites, they probably already have other sources.  It all boils
 down to the fact that bad news sells a whole lot more papers (and gets a whole
 lot better ratings) than good news.

 When you stop to think about it, the mainstream press has a lot of power.
 With a few strokes of typewriter keys they can destroy a person's reputation -
 - if their information is inaccurate and the person is innocent, well, they'll
 probably just publish a tiny `correction' on the back page, where nobody ever
 seems to look.  But as I said earlier, it's even worse with how the press has
 handled Bulletin Board Services; they haven't even bothered to print a
 correction.  In fact, they haven't even pointed out (and they may not even
 realize) that what they reported has implications that are simply put, lies.
 But I digress.

 The way I see it, shareware already has a strike against it -- the previously
 mentioned virus craze.  Add to that the low reputation of shareware in
 general, and many people equate the word shareware with "junkware."  You see,
 shareware has a bad, and not entirely underserved reputation for being "low
 quality."  While much of it isn't quite up to the standards of commercial
 software, there are many programs out there that are, made by programmers who
 have genuine concern about their both their programs and the people who use
 them.

 That's the real tragedy here; people who produce quality shareware and care
 having their software's reputation being ruined by people who don't on both
 counts.  I've said it myself, and be sure you listen carefully as to not
 misinterpret what I'm about to say: 90% of shareware is crap, but then again,
 so is 90% of everything else.  (A modified version of Sturgeon's law)  You
 see, most shareware is junk -- useless programs designed for long-outdated
 purposes.  When a rare jewel comes along, it really stands out, and boy does
 it make an impression.

 Before the release of Wolfenstein in '92, those who played Apogee/id games
 were a fairly small group; no one at that time actually believed that a
 shareware game could be commercial quality.  But with the release of
 Wolfenstein, users began to doubt their initial assumption, and with the
 release of Doom, it became clear that shareware products could rival, if not
 surpass, commercial products.  The effect this had on the shareware market,
 not to mention the commercial market, was profound: shareware developers and
 commercial developers alike set their sites on an attempt at recreating what
 made those games so popular.  But what they forgot was that they were trying
 to recreate the one thing that simply cannot be recreated: originality.  But I
 digress.

 I'm now on the Internet; paul@gnet.com is my official Internet address.  I
 also receive groups called Usenet newsgroups, forums for discussion on various
 topics.  Serious discussion goes on here about the nature of the Internet, and
 what, if anything, should be censored?

 I did a paper on computer controversy, which examined what exactly the
 controversy was about, and while doing the report, I came across a point which
 I believe sums up much of the issue:  it is essentially a battle between those
 who wish to censor the 'Net and those who see censorship as an infringement on
 their right to do what they want, when they want, in their own home.  Both of
 these points are valid, and each of them has its own set of pros & cons.
 Obviously, some of the material posted online is obscene, material that is
 illegal to knowingly distribute to minors.  However, the Internet is not
 censored, nor is it hooked up in such a way as to scan what the age the person
 logging on is.  In order to stop the distribution of such materials, it
 becomes necessary to destroy the groups altogether, even for adults licensed
 to see it.  This is again, obviously not a preferable course of action.

 Most of the users of the Internet simply do not want the government
 interfering with what has been an uncontrolled operation for virtually as long
 as it has existed.  What do they fear?  Invasion of their right to privacy --
 the Internet is a free domain, kind of an intercontinental link, where people
 are free to speak to each other about any topic they choose, without fear of
 being arrested.  If the government interferes first with censoring adult
 files, many 'Net users ask what's to prevent it from taking it a step further,
 and censoring any messages they feel are anti-government, racist, or violate
 whatever standards they wish to use?

 You know how it is; you've found a nice, relaxing place, without a care in the
 world (and with all your friends there with you), and all of a sudden an old
 teacher of yours walks in through the door.  The previous calm, relaxing
 atmosphere clearly dissipates, as the teacher walks through the door.  Even if
 you have nothing to hide, you're not just among friends anymore.

 This is symbolic of the Internet.  It's always been an electronic melting pot,
 a place where ideas are freely exchanged among friends.  In walks the
 government, though, and the feeling of freedom seems to fade away; it's not
 that you have anything to hide; you just simply don't like having yourself
 watched.  But that may be exactly what happens, if Senator Exon gets his wish.

 Senator Exon proposed a bill that would censor adult materials from the
 Internet; where did he get the idea?  Not from the 'Net itself; Senator Exon
 has never even accessed the 'Net!  He got his idea from a show doing a report
 on child pornography and the 'Net!  I've already stated my opinions of such
 reports and I believe that before Mr. Exon passes judgment on the Internet, he
 should access it and explore all the things that are positive: you'll never
 hear about that from the mainstream media.

 Enforcement:  The Information Superhighway is just that, Super.  It expands
 over millions of computers, covering thousands and thousands of topics,
 containing hordes of files, and consisting of millions of unique individuals.
 Even if bills were passed allowing censorship of the Internet, think about the
 time and manpower that would be required to enforce such a move.  Destroy one
 segment of the Internet, and you destroy the atmosphere that has been building
 up for years.

 Like I said before, if people want obscene materials, they'll get them, with
 or without the Internet.  Government intervention will only create anarchy
 amongst the users of the 'Net, and that could transform into very real riots.
 Internet users are resourceful though; I'll paraphrase a quote I once heard:
 If the government invades the Internet, there will be a new Internet tomorrow.

 Spiffy Voom FAX 2001 Model 501SP Instruction Manual

 Congratulations!  You have just purchased the Spiffy Voom FAX 2001 MODEL
 501SP!  It not only allows you to send and receive faxes, it will take voice
 messages on the internal answering machine, make color photocopies of
 important documents like this manual, grill hot dogs, fry eggs, dry your hair,
 replace your alarm clock, and attend school or work on your behalf!

 Some of the options (hot dog grilling and egg frying) require the Spiffy Voom
 CSPU20027-1 interface available for a modest fee of slightly less than the
 national debt.

 How to work the SPIFFY VOOM FAX 2001 MODEL 501SP:

 Plug it in.  If it doesn't work, then you're obviously doing something wrong.
 Remove the plug from the outlet in your left ear and try plugging it into a
 wall socket while holding your other hand in a bowl of water.  If several
 zillion volts of electricity course through your body, then the equipment is
 working satisfactorily.

 Turn it on.  A red LED display will appear by the button that says "Answer."
 If the red LED display does not appear, we probably sold you a defective
 product but there's not much point in trying to return it since we'll simply
 ignore you until the warranty expires or Hell freezes over - whichever comes
 first.

 Hit the button that says "Fax."  This will enable you to send faxes if the red
 LED display is on.  If the red LED display is not on, pressing the "Fax"
 button will probably cause the machine to explode and kill you.

 Programming numbers into your machine is accomplished by calling our customer
 service department who will explain it much better than a goon who's writing a
 manual about a product he understands nothing about.

 WARRANTY:  The SPIFFY VOOM FAX 2001 MODEL 501SP is guaranteed to work for as
 long as the box remains sealed.  Under no circumstances should you open the
 box but if you do, KEEP THIS PRODUCT AWAY FROM ELECTRICITY AT ALL TIMES.

 PC Magazine, the largest computer related magazine in the country, has once
 again awarded its "Editors' Choice Award" to Clark Development Company's
 PCBoard Bulletin Board Software.  A complete review and comparison of the
 various BBS software packages on the market appears in the August 1995 Network
 Edition of the magazine.  This is not the first time that PC Magazine has
 reviewed BBS software, however, PCBoard is the only one to ever win this
 prestigious award.

 Windows 95, the most hyped software release in recent memory, is scheduled for
 release on August 24, 1995.  Microsoft will spend $150 million advertising the
 new version.  Microsoft operating systems, DOS and Windows, are currently
 installed on approximately 80% of the today's personal computers and Microsoft
 believes up to 25% of them will be upgraded to Windows 95 over the next year.
 In a related issue, the Justice Department announced on August 8, 1995, that
 they will not take any antitrust action against Microsoft prior to the
 scheduled release date of Windows 95.  The Justice Department will continue to
 investigate the new on-line service, called Microsoft Network, which is being
 distributed with the new version of Windows.

 Apple Computer Inc. announced that they will be cutting the prices on their
 Power Macintosh line of personal computers.  The price reductions will range
 from 25% to 40%, depending on which machine is purchased.  Apple made the
 announcement just weeks before the scheduled released of Windows 95 and hopes
 that the pricing change will make Macintosh computers more competitive.
 Analysts believe that the price cuts will not stop Apple's dwindling share of
 the personal computer market.

 International Business Machines (IBM) announced on August 7, 1995 that they
 will concentrate more on home computers and other related products.

 to network type messages.  This is typically done to add a humorous thought
 onto the message.  The Pasco BBS Magazine will on occasion run some of our
 favorite taglines found while browsing the local nets.

 Meeting Meter Review
 --------------------

 The Meeting Meter calls itself a "taxi meter for meetings."  It was written to
 help those attending meetings become more aware of the value of their
 collective time.  The program is being distributed as Shareware to help
 promote awareness of what the Institute for Better Meetings calls the
 "meetings problem."  It is also their intention to distribute the Meeting
 Meter without charge to all government agencies, as they say "in the hopes
 that it will have some impact on the excessive spending associated with
 inefficient meetings."

 The Meeting Meter can operate as a TSR, or as a stand alone program.  You
 enter the combined rate of pay for those in attendance and watch the cost for
 the meeting rise.  You can also enter a budget for the meeting and the program
 will sound an alarm when that total is reached.  The meter can easily be
 turned on and off, and the information can be saved for meetings that last
 more than one session.  The program also displays a "Meeters List" which, if
 people come and go, can be changed to reflect the current participants.

 The authors of this program, Bernard DeKoven, Neal Margolis and Robert
 Leyland, can be reached at the Institute for Better Meetings, 2972 Clara
 Drive, Palo Alto, CA 94303.  Registration for non-government users is $40.00.

 PBM Flashback - September 1993
 ------------------------------

 In the September 1993 issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine, Dan Linton of Software
 Creations BBS commented on winning The Boardwatch Top 100 Reader's Choice BBS
 Contest.  His Clinton, Massachusetts based board, which went on-line January
 1, 1990, also won the subsequent year.  Here is some of what Dan Linton said
 two years ago this month, when he was asked how it felt to be named the top
 bulletin board.

 "Sure, it feels good, what can I say.  I think it was the help of many, many
 people that put us on top.  All the Authors writing great software for us to
 release, all the companies like APOGEE with their support and promotion, and
 all the great users who voted us into the spot.  Everyone deserves the
 congratulations."

 Editor's Note:  PBM Flashback will appear on a regular basis in future issues.
 Most issues will have this brief look back at some of the features which have
 appeared over the history of the Pasco BBS Magazine.
