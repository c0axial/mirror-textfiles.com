 Editor's Welcome
 ----------------

 Welcome to the November issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine.  Hard to believe that
 another year is rapidly drawing to a close.  I imagine some people have
 already started their Christmas shopping.

 This month's issue tells how Tampa Bay landed ONE BBSCON '95.  Hear what Jack
 Rickard and Phil Becker have to say about next year's event.  There is also an
 article on a new national Sysop organization.  While few can doubt the
 necessity of such an organization, historically efforts to organize Sysops
 have not met with much success.  I want to wish the Association of Online
 Professionals good luck with this latest attempt.  Paul Pollack returns with
 an interesting feature called "Buy, Bye Cash.  The Seven Most Common Game
 Purchasing Mistakes."  Paul is sort of a game guru around these parts, and
 look for his articles in the magazine for some time to come.  We also
 introduce a new regular feature this month, BBS door reviews by Matt Holden.
 Thanks go out to Matt for his help, and I look forward to his future
 submissions.  This month also has another installment in our Favorite
 Taglines, a couple of interesting press releases and more.

 Thank you to all who helped with this month's issue.

 How Tampa Bay Landed ONE BBSCON '95
 -----------------------------------

 This month the Pasco BBS Magazine begins its extensive monthly coverage
 leading up to ONE BBSCON '95, which will be held in downtown Tampa next
 August.  In three short years, ONE BBSCON has developed into the most
 significant assemblage of on-line enthusiasts held each year.  Early estimates
 are that 7,000 to 8,000 people will attend the event when it comes to the
 Tampa Convention Center August 16-20, 1995.  The partnership of Jack Rickard,
 editor of Boardwatch Magazine, and Phil Becker, author of the TBBS BBS
 Software and President of eSoft, Inc., has made the dream of an on-line
 industry show a reality.  At ONE BBSCON '94, both these gentlemen were kind
 enough to talk with the editor of the Pasco BBS Magazine about how Tampa Bay
 landed the 1995 version of BBSCON.

 Phil Becker confirmed the rumors that Tampa Bay was in the running for ONE
 BBSCON '94, before the decision was made to hold it in Atlanta.  "They were.
 Atlanta won because I was little bit concerned about going away from the
 population center.  We've been in the mountains for two years, this is our
 third show, this is a really critical one, and I really went for Atlanta
 mostly because it is a very easy hop here from so many places on the airlines.
 That is really a lot of what made this one win."

 What were the major factors that lead to Tampa Bay landing next summer's
 convention?  Phil Becker explained, "I'll tell you the honest truth, it was
 the Convention Center that did it.  That facility is gorgeous and it is really
 structured for the way we do this show."  Jack Rickard also talked about the
 Tampa Convention Center.  "I think it will work real well for the ONE BBSCON.
 I think they've got 600,000 square foot in there, beautiful session rooms,
 right on the water.  I think it will be a delightful place with adequate
 room."

 Jack Rickard was a bit more candid on the factors which lead to the final
 decision on where to hold the event.  "It was selected as the site because the
 Convention Center down there has a big hole in August, and they've got a
 beautiful Convention Center.  They were effectively persuasive.  They want the
 business.  We find that people like that are a lot easier to work with, we can
 be pretty demanding on hotels, Convention Centers and things of that nature."

 Which hotel will act as the headquarters hotel for ONE BBSCON '95?  Phil
 Becker began, "right now it looks like it is going to be the Hyatt that is
 near the Convention Center downtown.  The Wyndham is the other one, but I
 suspect it will be the Hyatt.  We'll have both hotels full."  When asked about
 the headquarters hotel, Jack Rickard indicated that a final decision has not
 been made.  "I am not sure yet.  That Convention Center, right down on the
 Bay, is the focus right now for our purposes.  They have several hotels down
 there, but I don't know which one will be the headquarters."  To elaborate,
 Phil Becker was talking about the Hyatt Regency Tampa and the Wyndham Harbor
 Island Hotel.

 How many people can we expect to come to the Tampa Bay area for the event?
 Phil Becker gave his best guess.  "This thing is growing at such a curve.
 This is our third show, it was only two years ago we did the first one.  We
 had 980 people at the first one, we had 1,950 people last year and we'll have
 close to 4,000 this year.  And I would say that the way we're growing and
 going, in Tampa we will probably have 7,000 to 8,000 at least."

 The Pasco BBS Magazine will continue to keep you up to date on the events
 leading up to ONE BBSCON '95.  Each month we will have coverage of what will
 be the most dramatic event in the history of the Tampa Bay on-line community.
 Next month's issue will feature the history of the ONE BBSCON.

 A Look at the Association of Online Professionals
 -------------------------------------------------

 The Association of Online Professionals (AOP) was announced at the ONE BBSCON
 held in Atlanta during August.  This is a new Professional Organization for
 system operators and others interested in on-line activities.  The primary
 goals of the AOP are defined in the mission statement.  "The Association of
 Online Professionals is a non-profit service and support organization that
 exists to foster and promote the growth of individuals, organizations and
 companies that operate, consult with and support electronic communications and
 information services worldwide."

 David McClure, Executive Director of the AOP, spoke at the ONE BBSCON during a
 session to introduce the new trade organization.  "The industry has grown up.
 It's come from a handful of boards run by enthusiasts, to a rich and wonderful
 land populated by major on-line services, mail services, the Internet and more
 than 60,000 electronic bulletin boards.  Much of what has happened to our
 industry, and to Sysops, over the last two decades has been very positive.
 But, as we look to the future there are concerns that, if we don't begin to
 act in our own interests, much of what we worked so hard to build is going to
 be lost.  There is trouble coming for our industry.  It is trouble that will
 reach down and touch every system operator, every on-line service and every
 user in our electronic community."

 McClure went on to discuss some of the legislative activities going on in our
 nation's capitol which threaten the on-line community.  "In Washington, D.C.,
 the working group on Intellectual Property Rights of the Federal Information
 Infrastructure Task Force has release a preliminary report that reflects the
 administration's plans for revisions to copyright laws.  Among these are
 amendments to the law that would hold Sysops responsible for the collection of
 royalty fees on electronic works, and financially liable for copyright
 infringement on their boards, weather or not they were aware of that
 infringement.  A new Senate bill requires public access elements of the
 National Information Infrastructure to set aside part of their operating
 capacity for use by public interest groups and arts organizations."

 There are also concerns and test cases occurring at the local levels of
 government.  David McClure continued, "in the state of Pennsylvania,
 aggressively seeking new tax revenues, they have adopted section 61 of
 Pennsylvania Constitutional Statute 60.13.  This new policy will for the first
 time place a state sales and use tax on changes for connection time, downloads
 and other on-line services.  Pennsylvania is not alone, twenty-five other
 states are watching closing and may be expected to introduce similar policies
 in the near future.  Missouri is one of the states that plans to attempt to
 apply an entertainment tax against all on-line services including bulletin
 boards.  Why is this worse than a sales tax?  Sales and use taxes tend to
 average around 4-6%, entertainment taxes generally range from 8-13%."

 The AOP's Executive Director also talked about some of the other legal
 problems now facing system operators.  "In New York, Ohio, California and
 elsewhere, federal agents have raided BBSs, seizing equipment and shutting the
 boards down for copyright infringement.  Are these Sysops guilty of copyright
 infringement?  We may never actually know the answer know the answer to that,
 because a year, two years later, not a single charge has been files against
 these Sysops.  Their equipment remains seized under lock and key, the boards
 are silent and these Sysops have not had their day in court."

 David McClure also touched on some of the perception problems with bulletin
 boards, much of which can be attributed to unbalanced reporting in the media.
 "In cities and towns across the county, media focus of our industry has been
 on software piracy, credit card theft, child pornography and other criminal
 activities.  Even main stream computer publications have come to question
 weather families and children are safe on-line.  Look at the number of
 organizations that are suddenly pulling away from the bulletin board, or
 electronic bulletin board.  Did you notice how everybody is trying to call
 their system now, information service, because they do not want to use the
 dreaded word BBS?  That is a warning sign."

 The Association of Online Professionals is planning a full range of member
 services.  There will be opportunities for interaction with other
 professionals, including seminars, conferences and regional events.  The AOP
 will give a voice in Washington, D.C., and in state capitols, working to
 protect on-line interests.  They will offer members professional advisory
 services on legal, business management, marketing and accounting issues.
 There will be increased opportunity for career development, education and
 accreditation services for professionals.  There will be industry-wide
 promotional programs to foster the growth of the on-line community, including
 media relations, joint marketing and public education.  There will also be AOP
 publications that include membership directory, resource guide, on-line
 systems legal guide and more.  There will be a member's only BBS system for
 communication of information vital to on-line operations and management.  The
 AOP will also publish a monthly newsletter, legislative alerts, accurate
 industry and marketing information, and other timely news.  They plan to offer
 discounts on essential products and services.  There is also the opportunity
 to take an active role in the growth and evolution of the world's fastest-
 growing and most vital industry.

 McClure elaborated on the topic of member discounts.  "We plan to leverage our
 buying power.  For some reason, that I have yet to understand, thousands of
 bulletin boards with millions of users all over this country, pay some of the
 highest long distance rates.  It seems to me, that ought to be the other way
 around.  Those discounts are something that we intend to seek very
 aggressively."

 Dennis Hayes announced, at ONE BBSCON's Welcoming Session, that he will serve
 as Chairman of the Board for the AOP's first year.  "I think that Sysops need
 their own group," Hayes began, "and there is one that is being proposed that
 is ready to go.  It has initial funding to get it started.  It is called the
 Association of On-line Professionals.  I have agreed that we can raise enough
 money to operate that for a year, and a good part of the funding comes from
 Sysops, that I'll serve as the chairman for the first year."

 David McClure commended Dennis Hayes on leading this new organization during
 its first year.  "It takes guts and commitment to step up to the plate and
 throw your support behind the Sysop community.  I truly believe that Dennis
 Hayes, and his staff, deserve recognition for their willingness to make this
 commitment."

 The AOP will have numerous mechanisms in place to run the association.  There
 will be a Public Policy Group to coordinate legislative and regulatory
 responses at the International, Federal and State levels in support of member
 interests.  A Sysop Certification Committee will design a training course and
 test to become an AOP Certified System Operator.  This designation is a
 hallmark of professional achievement, and oversight of this process is one of
 the most important contributions a member can make.  There will be an Industry
 Marketing Group to develop and implement joint marketing programs to members
 and consumers.  A Sysop Section Board of Governors will direct the activities
 of the System Operator membership section, setting priorities and guiding the
 section staff in providing services to system operator members.  An Industry
 Awards Committee will establish categories, define criteria, select judges and
 make awards for achievements in on-line communications.  The Standards
 Committee will establish a Code of Professional Standards for member system
 operators.  In cases where violation of this code is alleged, member of this
 committee will serve to evaluate cases and recommend appropriate actions.

 The AOP will have three separate classes of membership.  System Operator
 ($150.00 a year):  System Operator members are individuals who manage or
 operate systems that include BBS systems, nodes of the Internet, nodes on
 message networks, remote access computers and other systems.  Corporate
 ($5,000.00 a year):  Corporate members include companies that provide
 hardware, software, access services and other direct services or support for
 system operators.  A Corporate membership includes five individual
 memberships.  Associate ($150.00 a year):  Associate members are actively
 involved in the industry, but do not manage systems.  These include service
 providers, educators, law enforcement officials, government employees and
 others who share a commitment to the growth of the on-line community.

 To those who may feel that the dues may be too high, and could actually hamper
 the growth of this young association, McClure explained the reasoning behind
 the dues structure.  "Unless we build a strong core and make ourselves
 financially sound, we know from the experience of other associations, that
 offering a very inexpensive class of membership immediately has the greatest
 likelihood of putting the association under financially within its first year.
 We did not include a membership class for those who essentially want a social
 association, but we will include them in AOP.  We are non-profit, the only
 people who are going to get rich from our efforts are our members."

 It will be interesting to follow the progress of the Association of Online
 Professionals.  Few can doubt the need for such an organization, but
 unfortunately, past attempts to organize Sysops have not yielded much success.
 David McClure explained why the time was right for the AOP.  "There comes a
 time in the growth of every industry where the responsible and forward
 thinking members of that industry recognize that we have to begin to work
 together, if we want to maintain independence from unwanted regulation and
 legislation.  For our industry, that time is now.  The ability to speak as an
 industry, with a single voice, is the only viable means to counter unwanted
 regulation and shape public policy in ways favorable too our industry's
 growth.  This has to be done at the federal, state and the local level."

 Buy, bye cash.  The Seven Most Common Game Purchasing Mistakes
 --------------------------------------------------------------

 By Paul Pollack, author of GamePlay, New Port Richey, FL
 Edited by Alex Thomas, editor of GamePlay, New Port Richey, FL

 Gaming is a hot and ever-changing industry.  If you're a gamer, which you
 probably are if you're reading this, you have bought games.  Admit it, one
 time or another you've been ripped off by flashy advertising or just plain-old
 impatience.  I know of a person who had a fifty dollar gift certificate for
 Electronics Boutique.  He first spent it on SimCity 2000, then found out it
 wouldn't work on his computer and returned it.  Then he wasted it on Space
 Quest IV packaged with a hintbook.  Why do I say wasted?  Two weeks later I
 got an ad from Sierra advertising the same thing for only twenty-five dollars.
 I'll tell you how to be sure this doesn't happen to you.  I'm about to present
 the seven most common mistakes when buying a computer game.

 Mistake #1:  Buying a game to make your computer look good

 If you buy a game to make your computer look good, then that's probably all
 the game will do, and you might even be better off just buying a screen saver.
 A lot of games are long on graphics utilizing digitized video and sound, but
 when it comes to interactivity come out short.  Another related topic is
 seeing the graphics of a game on a demonstration window and immediately
 assuming that the other elements of the game are just as good.

 Mistake #2:  Buying a game packaged with a hintbook

 No matter how much self-control you think you have, one time or another you're
 going to sneak a peak at the hintbook.  Far too often though, many gamers
 simply use the hintbook in an improper way, for puzzles that they could have
 figured out on their own.  Buying a hintbook with a game can be a huge waste,
 because it not only costs more, but limits the replay value.  Although game
 manufacturers try, there are very few adventure games that are replayable more
 than once.  And although plot branches like those in Heart of China and Rise
 of the Dragon add to the replay value, the main objective never changes and
 you never get direct control over the storyline.

 Mistake #3:  Buying a game because you like the genre

 Not all games are created equal.  Just because you like one game in a
 particular genre doesn't mean you'll like all the others in that genre.  Games
 of the same type can vary widely, often tremendously.  Take RPGs (Role-Playing
 Games) for example.  Most RPGs are first-person, but the core of the RPGs
 differ.  The EOB (Eye of the Beholder) series takes place in the AD&D II
 edition universe, while Betrayal at Krondor takes place in the world presented
 in Feist's novels.  The presentation in the games also vary.  While Eye of the
 Beholder uses the "10-step at a time" method for movement, Betrayal at
 Krondor, Ultima Underworld, and The Elder Scrolls: Arena all use the newer
 smooth-scrolling Wolfenstein-type movement.  And in some games like
 Daemonsgate, you aren't even presented with a first-person view, rather an
 overhead one.  The differences in these games are huge, but they all go under
 the broad heading of role-playing games.

 Mistake #4:  Buying a game because the ad looks good

 Looks can be deceiving, and what may look good in an ad in a little two inch
 square, may look blockier on a fourteen, seventeen, or twenty-one inch
 monitor.  In many ads you don't even know if you're viewing the actual screen
 shots because in small print it says "Actual screens may vary."  Besides,
 these ads are put out by the manufacturers and they want you to buy their
 games whether they're good or not.  In the ads they show only the good points
 of the game, while keeping back the bad.

 Mistake #5:  Buying a game without researching the prices

 It's the same as buying anything else.  You have to try and find the lowest
 price before you buy a game.  Often times, I've seen games selling for more at
 a local store or through the mail, than if you bought directly from the
 companies themselves.  A couple of years ago we were thinking about purchasing
 Sierra On-Line's Quest for Glory I remake computer game.  We kept looking
 around for better prices.  It turned out that Sierra itself was selling it
 cheaper than most of the mail-order places.  Research the prices.  It'll PAY
 off in the long run.

 Mistake #6:  Not checking hardware requirements beforehand

 Imagine this.  You're sitting on your couch watching television, and someone
 with a package arrives at your door.  It turns out that the package is the
 latest, and best game out.  You tear past the wrap and eagerly insert the
 disks.  After installation you type in the command to start.  Suddenly the
 message "Insufficient memory" comes across the screen.  Trust me, this happens
 a lot, but you can make sure it doesn't happen to you by checking the labels
 before buying, or asking the person on the phone before ordering.  Making sure
 you have the right hardware can save time and money in the long run.

 Mistake #7:  Buying a game because the other versions were good

 Many gamers were probably eager to start lightning kicks and fireballs on
 their home PC last year with the release of Street Fighter II.  "It has to be
 good," they thought to themselves.  After all, SF II was and still is one of
 the hottest games at the arcades.  But SF II for the PC was a big
 disappointment, due to the clumsy code and infuriating control.  Another
 example would be the CD version of Maniac Mansion II.  The CD version is
 terrific with good voice-overs, but without them it's just another adventure
 game.  Reviews for the CD version may not be applicable to the disk-based
 version and vice versa.  To sum it all up, you can't really judge a game until
 you've played it.

 Hello..  Every month, I plan to review one door.  I have a staff of three
 reviewers on my BBS to rate the game.  I will show the registration amount,
 Pasco BBSs the door is available on, the latest version and filename.  This is
 the first edition of my door column.  This month's door is going to be Mines
 of Gorr.  All doors reviewed will be available for play on The Storm's Fury
 BBS, (813) 843-8905, (813) 849-2272.  I am not going to be able to list every
 system that has a door, but I will do my best.  If I miss you, email me on my

 Favorite Taglines
 -----------------

 Some bulletin boards and off-line mail readers are set-up to add taglines
 to network type messages.  This is typically done to add a humorous thought
 onto the message.  The Pasco BBS Magazine will on occasion run some of our
 favorite taglines found while browsing the local nets.  Here are some more of
 our favorite taglines.

 WordMax Review
 --------------

 Soleau Software is well known in the Shareware market for logic and strategy
 games which are suitable for the entire family.  WordMax is another very well
 done game, which can be quite addicting.

 The objective of WordMax is to spell as many words as possible using the
 letters from a "master word."  The words you create will be checked against a
 dictionary of over 80,000 words.  New words have to be at least three letters
 in length, and if the master word contains a "S" remember to try the plural to
 make another word.  You may be surprized by how many words are contained
 within some of the master words.  For example, "bastille" contains 157 words.
 You can also enter your own words, as WordMax will check your word against its
 dictionary and let you know how many words can be created using the letters in
 the word you have entered.

 The Shareware version has a list of 35 master words, but registration gives a
 list of 100.  The Shareware version only allows inputing your own custom word
 of four letters, but the registered copy allows for up to eight letters.
 The registration fee for WordMax is $18.00.

 WordMax is very well done.  It is the type of game where, if you are not
 careful, you might learn something.

 FBI Raids Major San Fernado Valley BBS
 --------------------------------------

 The Federation Bureau of Investigation on Saturday, September 13, 1994, raided
 "Moonbeams," a computer bulletin board located in Northridge, CA, which has
 allegedly been illegally distributing copyrighted software programs.  Seized
 in the raid on the Moonbeams bulletin board were computers, hard disk drives
 and telecommunications equipment, as well as financial and subscriber records.
 For the past several months, the Software Publishers Association ("SPA") has
 been working with the FBI in investigating the Moonbeams bulletin board, and
 as part of that investigation has downloaded numerous copyrighted business and
 entertainment programs from the board.

 The SPA investigation was initiated following the receipt of complaints from a
 number of SPA members that their software was being illegally distributed on
 the Moonbeams BBS.  The Moonbeams bulletin board.  It had 2 nodes available to
 callers and over 6,000 subscribers throughout the United States and several
 foreign countries.  To date, the board has logged in excess of 1 million phone
 calls, with new calls coming in at the rate of over 250 per day.  It was
 established in 1987 and had expanded to include over 6 gigabytes of storage
 housing over 10,000 files available to subscribers for downloading.  It had
 paid subscribers throughout the United States and several foreign countries,
 including Canada, Luxembourg, France, Germany, Finland, the Netherlands,
 Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

 A computer bulletin board allows personal computer users to access a host
 computer by a modem-equipped telephone to exchange information, including
 messages, files, and computer programs.  The systems operator (Sysop) is
 generally responsible for the operation of the bulletin board and determines
 who is allowed to access the bulletin board and under what conditions.  For a
 fee of $49.00 per year, subscribers to the Moonbeam's bulletin board were
 given access to the board's contents including many popular copyrighted
 business and entertainment packages.  Subscribers could "download" or receive
 these files for use on their own computers without having to pay the
 copyrighted owner anything for them.

 "The SPA applauds the FBI's action today," said Ilene Rosenthal, general
 counsel for the SPA.  "This shows that the FBI recognizes the harm that theft
 of intellectual property causes to one of the U.S.'s most vibrant industries.
 It clearly demonstrates a trend that the government understands the
 seriousness of software piracy."  The SPA is actively working with the FBI in
 the investigation of computer bulletin boards, and similar raids on other
 boards are expected shortly.  Whether it's copied from a program purchased at
 a neighborhood computer store or downloaded from a bulletin board thousands of
 miles away, pirated software adds to the cost of computing.  According to the
 SPA, in 1991, the software industry lost $1.2 billion in the U.S. alone.
 Losses internationally are several billion dollars more.

 "Many people may not realize that software pirates cause prices to be higher,
 in part, to make up for publisher losses from piracy,"  says Ken Wasch,
 executive director of the SPA.  "In addition, they ruin the reputation of the
 hundreds of legitimate bulletin boards that serve an important function for
 computer users."  The Software Publishers Association is the principal trade
 association of the personal computer software industry.  It's over 1,000
 members represent the leading publishers in the business, consumer and
 education software markets.  The SPA has offices in Washington DC, and Paris,
 France.

 Quarterdeck Announces QEMM 7.5 for Windows and DOS
 --------------------------------------------------

 Quarterdeck Office Systems, Inc. today announced version 7.5 of QEMM, its
 award-winning, category-leading memory manager.  This new release marks the
 first time a memory manager has been released with native Windows
 installation, configuration, and reporting utilities.  The new version will
 ship by the end of the fiscal quarter to Quarterdeck distributors and
 retailers.

 "We are constantly updating QEMM to meet the requirements of the newest
 platforms and applications," said Alexander Eckelberry, group product manager
 for utilities.  "This new version has many enhancements including new
 utilities for Microsoft Windows, and significant under-the-hood improvements
 to QEMM itself.  We have also increased our support for the IBM Thinkpad and
 Toshiba lines of portables, certain Compaq PCs and Stacker disk compression
 software; as well as enhancements to QEMM's ability to accommodate and
 configure a wider variety of unusual system architectures to provide increased
 available memory to these systems."

 "QEMM has been completely re-engineered internally" added Michael Bolton, QEMM
 technical product manager.  "We are now using a 32-bit flat memory model that
 puts us in line with the present and future of PC operating environments, and
 that gives us improved performance.  The QuickBoot feature and Stealth support
 enhancements are also impressive technological innovations from our
 developers."

 The major enhancements found in QEMM 7.5 are:

 Windows Installation - QEMM 7.5 can now be installed from DOS or Windows,
 detecting the user's environment and presenting the appropriate DOS or native
 Windows user interface.  This is an improvement over having separate programs
 for DOS or Windows installation.

 Windows Version of Qsetup - QSETUP is the utility that allows the user to
 optionally customize QEMM configurations quickly and easily, and provides a
 wealth of technical tips for advanced users.  Formerly a DOS-only program,
 Qsetup automatically presents the user with a DOS or native Windows interface
 in the same way as the installation program.

 New Manifest 3.0 - Manifest, Quarterdeck's award-winning system reporting and
 diagnostic utility, now comes in a version that presents a DOS or native
 Windows interface in the same way as the setup and installation programs.  In
 both environments, new reports on hardware IRQs and on PCMCIA assist users in
 learning about their system configuration.  Under Windows, Manifest will also
 provide detailed reports on memory usage by Windows itself and by the programs
 running under it.

 Enhanced Support for Stacker - Through a cooperative effort between
 Quarterdeck and Stac Electronics, QEMM 7.5 now includes technology to save
 Stacker 4.0 users an additional 8K, 16K or 32K of conventional memory,
 depending on disk size.  This allows the Stacker driver to reduce its memory
 footprint to less than 10K in conventional memory, an innovation accomplished
 by providing a means for a Stacker driver to load its disk buffer into
 extended memory.  This functionality is provided through a new Stacker driver,
 to be made available free of charge within the next 30 days by Stac
 Electronics to registered Stacker 4.0 users.

 "With Stacker 4.0, we significantly reduced our conventional memory footprint
 and our users responded very positively," said Anne Galdos, senior product
 manager for Stac Electronics.  "Now, thanks to this cooperative effort between
 Stac and Quarterdeck, Stacker 4.0 users will get even more conventional memory
 when using QEMM 7.5."

 Enhanced Support for IBM Thinkpads - The design of some IBM Thinkpads
 prevented previous versions of QEMM from correctly configuring these systems.
 QEMM 7.5 can now properly detect and optimize all current IBM Thinkpad models.

 PCMCIA Support - QEMM 7.5 is now the only memory manager to detect and
 accommodate automatically the memory addresses used by PCMCIA cards.  This
 feature is essential for users of most current laptops and notebooks.

 QuickBoot - QuickBoot provides substantially faster system rebooting by
 providing a highly efficient routine for initializing the system hardware and
 BIOS.  This is particularly valuable for programmers, power users and those
 configuring systems.  It also makes the OPTIMIZE process faster.

 Stealth Enhancements - Stealth is the patented QEMM feature that gives users
 extra High RAM by mapping system, video, and other ROMs out of the first
 megabyte of memory.  Stealth and OPTIMIZE have been improved to accommodate
 unusual BIOS designs.  This will provide users of these systems with even more
 High RAM than was previously possible.

 32-bit Flat Memory Model - QEMM's internals have been modified to use a 32-bit
 flat memory model.  This provides improved performance and establishes a clear
 path for future innovations.

 Documented 3rd-party API - A previously undocumented feature of QEMM is its
 Application Programming Interface (API), which allows third party software
 developers to design their products with built-in support for QEMM.  This
 gives access to ROMs that have been "Stealthed" away using Quarterdeck's
 patented Stealth technology and allows developers to manage or even emulate
 hardware via I/O port trapping.

 Built-in Fail-Safe Recovery - QEMM now records and saves your system
 configuration at installation and each time you run the OPTIMIZE program.  At
 any time you can restore one of these configurations using the new
 OPTIMIZE/RESTORE option.

 The suggested list price of QEMM 7.5 is $99.95.  In the United States upgrades
 for QEMM 7.5 are available both directly from Quarterdeck and from dealers.
 The upgrade price directly from Quarterdeck for QEMM 7.5 is $29.95 plus $5.00
 shipping and handling.  The suggested list price of the upgrade through
 dealers is $34.95.

 Quarterdeck registered users who purchased the current version of QEMM after
 July 20, 1994 may upgrade for $5.00 shipping and handling, with proof of
 purchase.  All upgrades include new manuals.

 In the United States, users may upgrade from Quarterdeck by calling 24-hours a
 day.  Contact Quarterdeck's automated order processing system, Quartermaster,
