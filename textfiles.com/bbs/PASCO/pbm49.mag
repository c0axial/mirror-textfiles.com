 Editor's Welcome
 ----------------

 Welcome to another issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine.

 For some time I have thought of doing a publication, in addition to this one,
 which would be dedicated to gambling.  A decent name for this publication, so
 I thought, would be "Gamble 'zine."  I did not consider doing this new
 magazine every month, perhaps quarterly would have been a better idea.  But,
 then again, there is already this magazine, DA BUCS and BBS Basics to handle.
 So, maybe an additional project is not such a good idea.  Instead of
 generating a new magazine, the decision was made to run a special Gamble 'zine
 issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine.  Whether this will be a re-occurring theme,
 say on an annual basis, remains to be seen.  We already do a special issue on
 computer games and anything is a possibility.

 I have been somewhat fortunate to visit some of the world's gambling meccas in
 recent months.  A trip in December to Paradise Island in the Bahamas and the
 gorgeous Atlantis Resort and Casino.  A week in Las Vegas in May.  While not
 on a par with those locations, we even went out on the local gambling boat
 here in Port Richey, Florida.  As I write this, we are preparing for a cruise
 to the Bahamas and a return trip to Nassau.  I guess all these great vacations
 helped fuel the fire for this issue.

 It was never intended for this issue to be controversial, but there is an
 editorial on gambling leading off this issue.  Gambling related articles
 include Shareware Lottery Programs, How Computers Changed Blackjack, Baccarat
 - The Most Misunderstood of Casino Games Comes to the PC, Ultimate Software's
 Casino Game Machines and Some Other Gambling Related Shareware Programs.  PBM
 Flashback looks at an excursion to Cripple Creek, Colorado following ONE
 BBSCON '93.  Our regular features include Ed Garwood's Computer Basics, a
 couple of reviews and all the latest news.

 Good luck and thanks for reading!

 First, An Editorial
 -------------------

 I guess by running an issue focusing on gambling, and gambling related
 computer programs, the Pasco BBS Magazine could open itself up to criticism.
 Gambling is one of those things that people like to conveniently blame for
 society's ills.  The reality is that gambling has become a great way to raise
 revenue, as people are more willing to pay taxes through this method than
 others.  Since governments are in a tight fiscal crunch, and are looking for
 new ways to raise funds, there has been incredible growth in the gaming
 industry.

 Yes, there is a small percentage of people who are negatively impacted by
 gambling.  Legalized gambling is no different than any other aspect of
 society, since almost anything a person can think of has some negative impact.
 Yes, there are those few who are compulsive gamblers and gamble beyond what
 they can reasonably afford to lose.  It is naive to think that eliminating
 legalized gambling would help those afflicted with this sickness.  If there
 were not legalized forms of gambling, these types would find plenty of ways to
 place a bet illegally.

 Does running this "Gamble 'zine" issue have any negative effect on society?
 It might help some realize that there are computer programs that will reduce
 their losses at the casinos.  It is a stretch to say this publication could
 influence people to gamble.  Those who have a problem with gambling are
 encouraged to contact the Florida Council on Compulsive Gambling at (800) 426-
 7711.  If you live in another state, the Florida Council will be able to help
 you find assistance in your area.

 Editor's Note:  The Pasco BBS Magazine wants your opinion and welcomes
 opposing viewpoints.  Send along your opinions on this, or any other BBS or
 computer related, issue.

 Shareware Lottery Programs
 --------------------------

 The attraction of the lottery is simple.  For an investment of a single
 dollar, a person can win enough money to retire and live the life of luxury.
 While raising revenue is the major reason for lotteries, another advantage is
 that it gives people the chance to dream.  Who has not thought about hitting
 the lotto?  With the popularity of state lotteries, there are a growing number
 of computer programs being written for lottery players.  Many of these
 programs have detailed databases of past drawings, graphs depicting the most
 frequently drawn numbers and can select lottery numbers for the user.  While
 the lottery is pure random chance, many people are faithfully tracking the
 drawings in the attempt to identify hot numbers.  This article takes a look at
 some of the lottery programs found in the Shareware market.

 Florida Lottery - This is a very nice program written by Altamonte Springs,
 Florida resident Charles A. Hardy.  The program displays animated renditions
 of all three Florida lotteries, CA$H 3, Fantasy 5 and Lotto, with lotto balls
 rising up the screen.  There is the option of having the balls display the
 most, or least, picked numbers for the five and six number games.  The graphs,
 which display the frequency of number selection in the Fantasy 5 and lotto
 games, are stacks of lotto balls.  The program can also pick numbers and
 display them on animated play slips.  Also included are the rules for the
 different lottery games.  The author asks for a registration fee of $5 to $10,
 or 2% of your winnings.

 Florida Lotto Analyzer - This program is written by Tallahassee, Florida
 resident Ralph B. Davis Sr., and is distributed by C.H.F. Software, Inc.
 The Florida Lotto Analyzer has everything a person needs to track the results
 of the Florida lotto drawings.  It includes all past results and has many
 features.  Users can find out when certain numbers have been drawn, when the
 last time a number has been drawn, which are the hot and cold numbers, or the
 type of numbers drawn (odd-even, high-low).  There is a table listing the most
 and least drawn numbers, and a bar graph showing the frequency of number
 selection.  Also included are wheeling tables and the option of printing out
 most information.  While not graphically intensive, it is an easy to use
 program.  Florida Lotto Analyzer must be registered to add new results to the
 database, but the program's registration fee is only $10.

 FLOTTO - This program is written by Tampa, Florida resident Paul Carastro and
 distributed by PC Light, Inc.  FLOTTO calls itself "The Fast Lottery Program."
 It works with any three, four, five, six or seven number lottery game and will
 display the odds of hitting all the numbers.  Users may generate up to 1,000
 tickets, wheel numbers and track statistics.  The program does not feature
 intense graphics and may be registered for $19.95.

 FLOTTO - This program, which has the same name as the previous program, is
 written by Lithia, Florida resident Art Hoffman.  It has the ability to make
 selections for the CA$H 3 and lotto drawings.  There is also a menu item for
 past drawing statistics.  The program features no graphics and has a $15
 registration fee.

 Grand Prize Winner - This Windows program is distributed by Margate, Florida
 based Designer Label Software, but the distributed file does not give credit
 to the program's author.  The program allows the user to choose from a list of
 lotteries in the U.S. and includes Florida's Fantasy 5 and lotto drawings.
 Numbers can be picked randomly, or all hot, or all cold, numbers.  There is an
 analysis chart for each number, along with several other reports, which can be
 sent to a printer or file.  Grand Prize Winner has a $20 registration fee.

 KPS Lotto - Since this program was written by Porterville, California resident
 Richard D. Kelley, and distributed by Kelley Programming System, KPS Lotto
 comes with information on the California lottery.  The program is easily
 configured for any state lottery drawing and includes an informational file
 for that particular lottery.  This program is designed to be a simple way to
 keep track of past drawings and to compute statistics for evaluating past
 drawings.  Menu items include:  View past drawings, Trends & Patterns, View
 statistics board, Print statistics sheet, Pick new LOTTO numbers, Compare
 numbers to drawing and Find winning tickets.  The program also features a
 wheeling system and a $15 registration fee.  KPS Lotto does not have much in
 the way of graphics, but is easy to use.

 Lotto Buster - This program is written by Edmonton, Alberta, Canada residents
 Kenneth J. Tetterington and Michael Ingram, and distributed by Distant
 Markets.  Lotto Buster is a full featured program with 60 different lotto
 drawings to select from, including Florida.  The program displays information
 for three and six number draws, and has various search features.  Easy to read
 graphs display statistics on the frequency of numbers coming up, in-frequency
 of numbers drawn, dry spells, along with the hot and cold numbers.  Drawings
 are simulated with a graphical rendition of the lotto balls.  The program,
 which has a rather steep $70 (Canadian) registration fee, has the option of
 having a subliminal message displayed on the screen.

 Lotto Challenger - This program is written by Brandon, Florida resident John
 Lake and is distributed by Data Solutions.  There are plenty of statistics on
 past drawings, including a complete history, number frequency, hot and cold
 numbers, overdue numbers and a drawing summary.  Lotto Challenger has several
 number systems and wheeling options, along with the ability to make quick
 picks.  It comes setup for the Florida lottery, but can easily be configured
 for any 5 or 6 number lotto.  While there are not any intense graphics, there
 is a good amount of information displayed.  There is a $29.50 registration fee
 for the program.

 Lotto Mania - This program is written by Kanata, Ontario, Canada resident R.
 Leafloor.  It uses single key strokes for most operations and is based on six
 number lotto games.  Information displayed includes a list of
 the past draws and the frequency for each of the numbers.  There is the
 ability to see how numbers have performed in the past and a random number
 generator that produces quick pick numbers.  The Shareware version does not
 allow data manipulation, however, the program may be registered for $15.

 LottoMATIC - Panama City, Florida based CTech distributes this program without
 any mention of the program's author in the distributed file.  The program
 comes ready for the Florida lottery, but can be configured for virtually any
 lottery.  The program features drawing analysis, including tracking patterns
 and frequencies, and the history of the drawings.  While not graphically
 intense, the program is attractive and easy to use.  There are many different
 setup options and a registration fee of $25.00.

 Lotto Picker - This lottery number picker was written by Aurora, Colorado
 resident Jim Turner and is distributed by IN/QUEST, LLC.  After selecting a
 series of lotto numbers, this program constructs sorted lotto number sets from
 the selections.  The "best set of numbers and best set base on best individual
 numbers" can be displayed.  There are not any graphics, but Lotto Picker can
 be registered for $10.

 LottoProf - This program is distributed by Waterloo, Ontario, Canada based
 ColorVision Computing, but the program's author is not credited in the
 distributed file.  LottoProf is designed for any 5 or 6 number lotto game and
 maintains a detailed history of winning numbers.  The program claims to have
 "sophisticated analysis capabilities" and that it "stands alone amongst lotto
 programs."  However, user friendliness is not one of its strong suits.
 LottoProf has a registration fee of $49.95.

 Lottery Professor - This program for Windows is written by Gainsville, Georgia
 resident Ken Thomson.  The Lottery Professor comes setup for the Georgia
 lottery, including their Cash 3, Fantasy 5 and lotto, but it can be used for
 any state lottery game.  The "pick" button selects numbers based on the user's
 criterion, such as, select only hot numbers.  Selected numbers are color coded
 when displayed, for example, blue would be a cold number.  The history button
 gives quite a bit of detail at the click of a mouse.  The "lotto hit history"
 shows how many times each number has hit, and ranks the hot and cold numbers.
 Click on graph and the number frequency is displayed that way, or click on
 percentage and see the number frequency displayed as a percentage.  Users may
 track their own lottery results, including how much money has been won or
 lost.  There are many features in this program, which has a $30 registration
 fee.

 Lotto Prophet - This program is written by Port Charlotte, Florida residents
 Gene P. Davis and Elizabeth Meneely, and is distributed by DataMicro.  When
 generating random numbers, users are asked for their astrological sign.  The
 program displays hot numbers, cold numbers and "Power/Due" numbers.  There are
 also wheeling systems and a menu item for a "super statistical report."  There
 is also the ability to produce "prophet cards," graphs and trend charts, but
 this may not be the easiest program to figure out.  Lotto Prophet does not
 have much in the way of graphics and can be registered for $19.

 Lotto Stat - This program is written by Westerville, Ohio resident Richard J.
 Jones, who operates his own computer consulting business.  The program is not
 exactly user-friendly and was difficult to review.  You have to look at the
 documentation prior to starting the program, to find the format to enter the
 desired lotto type, or the user will end up having to re-boot their machine.
 There was a problem loading the data file, so the menu options were not
 functional.  Lotto Stat has a registration fee of $39.95.

 Lotto Winner - This program was written by Los Angeles, California resident
 Konrad Musial and is distributed by ABCA.  Lotto Winner is actually an
 analysis of different methods of playing the lotto, such as betting the least
 frequent numbers, most frequent numbers or repetitive bets.  The program
 rates the methods and tries to "predict" the next drawing.  There is not much
 in the way of graphics, but it is an easy to use program with a $22
 registration fee.

 PC-LOTTOpro - This program does not give credit to the author, but it is
 distributed by the Toronto, Canada based The Lottery Exchange.  There is a
 menu item to select from a wide range of international lottery games.  The
 program generates a list of hot numbers, cold numbers and a report known as
 the "Table of Popularity."  Also included are quick picks, wheeling systems,
 the ability to print out most information and a sample "Group Buying
 Agreement."  The registration fee for this program is $65.

 Total Lottery System - This program was written by Toronto, Canada resident F.
 Fowler.  Features of this program include a "pick-a-winner" random number
 generator and a graph displaying number distribution, however, this frequency
 graph is not the easiest thing to read.  The Total Lottery System has a
 registration fee of $14.95.

 VIP Lotto - This program is written by Wise, Virginia resident David Allio and
 is distributed by VIP Software.  This is rather basic program to select number
 for "Pick Lotto" and "Keno Lotto" games.  The Keno Lotto game is how most
 state lotto are based.  VIP Lotto does not feature any graphics and can be
 registered for $20.

 Windows Lotto - This Windows program is written by Brandon, Florida resident
 John D. Lake and is distributed by Data Solutions.  The program features Quick
 Picks, 24 wheeling systems, the ability to search past drawings for
 occurrences of certain numbers and is compatible with lotteries that pick
 five, six or seven numbers.  There is a colorful trend chart, a "Skip and Hit"
 chart, a sequence chart and a repeating sets chart.  The on-line help is quite
 functional and the main screen has a nice graphic of a sack of money.  The
 basic registration fee is $35.95.

 WinLotto - This program is written by Toronto, Canada naive Scott Bee and is
 distributed by MicroChief.  This is a Windows program designed for six number
 lotteries.  There are menu options to draw random numbers, the six hottest
 numbers, the six coldest numbers, or from a range of numbers.  WinLotto does
 not have much in the way of graphics and costs $9.99 to register.

 Z-Blast Lotto Optimization Tool - This program is written by LaPorte, Texas
 resident Ted Parker and is distributed by T.M. Parker Software.  Using the
 concepts of "Table Optimization" and "Sum Total Analysis," this program
 selects a series of tickets to play.  It does not feature any analysis, past
 results, or graphs.  The Shareware version defaults to a 35/5 type lotto
 drawing, but any five or six number game may be defined in the registered
 version.  While not graphically intense, Z-Blast is an attractive and easy to
 use program.  DOS and Windows versions are available with a $39.95
 registration fee.

 How Computers Changed Blackjack
 -------------------------------

 Blackjack may be the second most popular gambling card game on Earth, second
 only to poker.  While blackjack has been around for hundreds of years, it took
 the invention of the computer to discover that this is one game which can be
 beaten.  The game played in American casinos is actually called twenty-one,
 based on the ancient French game of Vingt-Et-Un.  Blackjack is where the deal
 passes to another player when they get a Blackjack, or a natural two-card
 twenty-one.  In the game of twenty-one, and in the casinos, the house always
 keeps the deal.

 If you have been around a casino, or played the dice game craps, you have most
 likely heard the phase "the dice have no memory."  This is true because what
 happened on the previous rolls has absolutely no effect on what numbers will
 come up on subsequent rolls.  The odds on rolling a seven remain 1 in 6, no
 matter what has been rolled previously.  You will hear gamblers say that a
 point is due, the odds are in the favor of it, but the fact is that the odds
 are the same no matter what was rolled before.  The same point can made about
 the lottery, as people chart winning numbers and all that, but the odds are
 the same every week for any combination of numbers (even if it hit the week
 before).  Craps and the lottery are completely random selection, and as such,
 what happened before is irrelevant.

 In twenty-one, however, the cards that have been played do make a difference
 and this has led many to develop sophisticated card counting systems to track
 the previously played cards.  For example, if all the tens are already used up
 in the deck, the player is at a disadvantage because the profitability of
 doubling down and the chance of the dealer busting have been greatly reduced.
 This article will not go into the details of card counting, but it is a
 fascinating reality which still frightens the casinos today.

 Some of the early computer pioneers realized that Blackjack was a game based
 on the mathematical theory of probably and not pure random chance.  Edward O.
 Thorp wrote "Beat the Dealer" back in 1962 with the help of computer experts
 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an IBM 704 computer.  He was
 not the first to recognize that the game could be beaten.  In 1956, Roger R.
 Baldwin, Wilbur E. Cantey, Herbert Maisel and James P. McDermott wrote an
 article for the Journal of the American Statistical Association entitled "The
 Optimum Strategy in Blackjack."  Thorp's book refined this strategy and
 revealed the secrets of blackjack to the general public.  Beat the Dealer
 ended up on the national best sellers list.

 Edward O. Thorp laid out a "basic strategy" for playing the game based on
 thousands of computer simulated hands.  Players using just this strategy could
 actually play at a slight advantage, even if they didn't count cards.  New
 concepts like doubling-down on "soft" hands when the dealer had a bad card
 showing startled the industry, and show dealers today that at least you know
 the game.  The casinos reacted quickly to change some rules, like no more
 doubling down on eleven or splitting of aces.  The problem was even the
 uninformed players didn't like the changes, so the casinos figured they would
 make enough off the hack players to cover what the others were winning, and
 switched back to most of the old rules.

 Basic Strategy is not a "system," but is based on computer analysis, here are
 some highlights (soft is when an ace is counted as eleven, hard is when an ace
 is counted as one or no ace, face cards are considered tens).  The priority is
 spilt, double, soft stand and hard stand.

  When to Split Pairs                            When to Soft Double

 A,A   - Always                                 A,7 - Dealer has 3 thru 6
 10,10 - Never                                  A,6 - Dealer has 3 thru 6
 9,9   - Dealer has 2 thru 6,8,9                A,5 - Dealer has 4 thru 6
 8,8   - Always                                 A,4 - Dealer has 4 thru 6
 7,7   - Dealer has 2 thru 7                    A,3 - Dealer has 5, 6
 6,6   - Dealer has 3 thru 6                    A,2 - Dealer has 5, 6
 5,5   - Never
 4,4   - Never
 3,3   - Dealer has 4 thru 7                     Standing Numbers (Soft)
 2,2   - Dealer has 4 thru 7
                                                19 - Dealer has 9,10, A
                                                18 - Dealer has 2 thru 8
  When to Hard Double

 11 - Always                                      Standing Numbers (Hard)
 10 - Dealer has 2 thru 10
  9 - Dealer has 2 thru 6                       17 - Dealer has 7 thru A
                                                13 - Dealer has 2,3
                                                12 - Dealer has 4 thru 6

 Some of the early pioneers really cleaned up before the casinos caught on.  It
 was the computer which lead to the breakthrough.  Today there are many
 excellent computer programs which teach basic strategy and counting, and allow
 a player to practice without having to suffer the financial sacrifice that
 comes with learning the game at the casino.  One Shareware program, which has
 been around for at least five years, is Blackjack by Donald L. Granger.  This
 program not only teaches basic strategy, but several popular counting methods
 as well.  Some of today's Shareware programs, such as Accidental Software's
 Ultimate Blackjack, feature wonderful animation and sound effects.  Thanks to
 the computer, it is inexcusable for a player to learn the game at the casino.

 Baccarat, The Most Mis-Understood of Casino Games, Comes to the PC
 ------------------------------------------------------------------

 If you have been to Las Vegas you have no doubt walked by the baccarat tables
 and, perhaps, taken one look at the layout on the table and thought to
 yourself that it looked pretty complicated.  That mystique is reenforced by
 the casinos having the baccarat tables in a secluded roped off section of the
 casino with tuxedo clad coupdeaires handling the action.  The reality is that
 baccarat is the easiest of the casino table games to learn.

 It is generally accepted that the card game of baccarat dates back to 15th
 Century France, but some will argue that it is just a spin-off of blackjack
 dating back to the mid 1800's.  It is thought that the game began during the
 reign of Charles VIII who was the king of France from 1483 until his death in
 1498.  Charles VIII was a typical tyrant King who imprisoned his eventual
 successor, Louis XII, for rebellious behavior.  "Charles the Affable" invaded
 Italy in 1494, occupied Naples in 1495, and was part of the Valois Dynasty
 which reigned during The Hundred Years' War.  Considering the times, maybe a
 diversion like baccarat was needed.

 To this day, Baccarat remains the principal gambling card game of France and
 several other European countries, but the French also play a variation of the
 game called Baccara-en-Banque.  Baccarat is known as Punto Banco in England
 and some other counties.  In recent years, the original game of baccarat has
 been all but replaced by a speeded-up version, baccarat chemin-de-fer, usually
 called just chemin-de-fer.  The game played in American casinos actually came
 from Cuban casinos in the early 1950's.

 Just like the popular card games of blackjack and twenty-one, the differences
 between baccarat and chemin-de-fer are relatively minor.  In twenty-one the
 house always controls the deal of the cards and the bank, but in blackjack the
 dealing duties and the responsibility for covering the bets are passed when a
 player is dealt a two card natural twenty-one.  In chemin-de-fer every player
 has a chance to be the banker and may take over the bank by saying "Banco."
 In chemin-de-fer, the gamble is limited by the amount the bank is willing to
 lose and the banker is never liable for the payment in excess of his bank.  In
 the casino version of baccarat, the banker does not lose the bank when he
 loses a coup.  The casino remains the banker, so there is technically no limit
 and players can play against the casino's entire bankroll.

 Chemin-de-fer can typically have ten or more players and almost any number can
 play.  Each player is dealt an individual hand, but in the casino version of
 baccarat, only two hands are dealt, Player and Banker.  The shoe does pass
 from player to player in the casino variation but, as noted early, the casino
 assumes the permanent responsibility for the bank.  In the less formal game of
 chemin-de-fer the banker plays the Bank's hand and the players play their own
 hands, but in the casino game the player can select the Bank or Player bet and
 switch back and forth from bet to bet.  Another difference in chemin-de-fer is
 if a player has a total of five he must decide to ask for a third card, but in
 the casinos the player must draw a card.

 For all its mystique, baccarat remains a game anyone can play.  There are only
 two decisions that have to be made:  1) How much to bet, 2) Which side to bet
 on.  Typically eight decks of cards are shuffled together and dealt from a box
 called a shoe.  In front of each player at the table, there is a location
 where they place their bets.  A player can bet on either the Banker, Player or
 bet on a tie.  After the bets are placed, the dealer will deal out two hands.
 One is called the Player's hand, the other is called the Banker's hand.  We
 will discuss the rules of baccarat, but you do not have any decisions to make.

 Four cards are dealt face up on the table, two cards for the Player's hand and
 two for the Banker's hand.  The cards retain their face value with aces having
 a value of one and 10's, and face cards, having a value of 0.  If the cards
 total over ten, the first digit is dropped and only the last digit is used for
 game play.  The object is to get a card count of 9, or as close to 9 as
 possible.  If either the Player or the Banker has a total of 8 or 9 on those
 first two cards, the hand is over.  An 8 or 9 on the initial deal is called a
 natural and no third cards are dealt.  A 9 beats an 8 and ties are a push,
 neither side wins.

 If there are no naturals dealt in the first two cards, then additional cards
 are dealt.  The Player is the first to draw a card and must take a third card
 if their first two cards have a total of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.  If the Player
 has a total of 6 or 7, they cannot draw another card.  The following chart
 summarizes the rules for the Player's hand.

 If the first two cards total:  0-1-2-3-4-5  -  Draws a card
                                6-7          -  Stands
                                8-9          -  Stands (Natural)

 The rules for the Banker are bit more complicated and are regulated by the
 third card drawn by the player.  The following chart summarizes the rules for
 the Banker's hand.

                                   Draws when               Does not draw when
                                   player takes card        player takes card

 First two cards total:  0-1-2     Draws unless player 8-9  8
                         3         0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9      0-1-8-9
                         4         2-3-4-5-6-7              0-1-2-3-8-9
                         5         4-5-6-7                  0-1-2-3-4-5-8-9
                         6         6-7
                         7         Stands
                         8-9       Banker natural

 If Player doesn't draw a third card, the Banker draws on 0-1-2-3-4-5 and
 stands on 6-7-8-9.

 A five percent commission is charged on any winning bets made on the Banker's
 hand.  Bets on the Banker's hand and Player's hand are paid off at even money,
 but since the Bank has a slight edge there is the commission.  Tie bets are
 paid off at odds of 8 to 1.  The house has an edge of 1.35% over the Player
 and 1.20% over the Banker.  The odds against tie bets is 14.0918%.  Overall,
 the casino has a 1.27% advantage in the baccarat.  The only bet in a casino
 with lower odds are the odds bets, commonly called the back line, in craps.

 As with roulette, you will see people faithfully tracking the results of the
 previously played hands.  Most casinos are more than happy to provide a
 baccarat scorecard, technically called a "Table de Banque," for those players
 who wish to keep track of the previous results.  Some may make the argument
 that, as in blackjack, the previously played cards have some bearing on the
 future cards.  However, just as in roulette, the prevailing wisdom is that the
 previous results have little significance.  But, that does not keep players
 from writing down the result of every hand in their attempt to identify
 streaks.  Of course, there are people who have made huge sums of money by
 designing systems to beat casino games.  Unfortunately, the profit has come to
 those writing the books, instead of those buying the books.

 If this all sounds confusing, it really is not.  In the past, the only way to
 learn the game was to plop a few dollars down at the table and see what
 happens.  It was typically an expensive lesson.  Today, with personal
 computers commonplace, there is no longer an excuse for not thoroughly
 understanding a game before placing any of your hard earned money on the
 table.  After playing several computer generated baccarat games, you should
 quickly get a feel for the true simplicity of the game.

 One of the earliest baccarat games for the PC was written in 1986 by Castro
 Valley, California resident Raymond M. Buti.  It was a text based program with
 a registration fee of only $3.00, but it gave plenty of information about the
 game.  The screen displays a scorecard for tracking past hands, the Banker's
 and Player's current hand, statistics on the current session and an options
 box.  One of the options is the ability to display a menu of some of the most
 popular betting systems for playing the game.  Most systems are more of a
 money management technique, than a way to beat the game, but some people will
 swear by them.

 The Martingale system is very well-known, not only for baccarat, but for
 virtually any casino game.  The basics of Martingale are to start with a
 single betting unit and after a loss to double that betting unit, and continue
 doubling the bet until you win a hand.  The problem with this type of system
 is the table limit which could be reached after progressing through a handful
 of doubling your bets.  D'Alembert is another old system based on the doubling
 of bets, so the table limit will eventually catch up with you with that system
 too.  Thirty-One is another double up system but with a limit of 31 units.
 One system called Best Bet, while not guaranteeing that you will walk away a
 winner, does make more sense since it involves increasing your bets while you
 are winning.  It uses a progressive betting pattern of 1, 2, 3, 5, 5 and then
 8 betting units that are increased only after a win.  Start with a betting
 unit of 1 and keep betting that amount until you win a bet.  After a winning
 bet, jump to the next bet in the series until a bet is lost.

 The systems are interesting, and are a very nice touch to Mr. Buti's program,
 but no system should be seriously considered as a way to win at the casinos.
 In the documentation for his baccarat game, he puts it quite well.  "Remember
 that there aren't any sure fire ways of making money gambling.  There are ways
 of minimizing your loses or methods that can be used to increase your chances
 of winning the maximum amount during your stay at a table or even methods that
 allow you to play the best possible bets at any one game.  None will guarantee
 a winning strategy in the long run.  Most all gambling systems work for the
 short play in one way or the other.  But to sit and use a system for hours on
 end will eventually put you in the poor house."

 The best application of Baccarat for the PC is Ultimate Baccarat by Accidental
 Software of Apple Valley, California.  Terry Hastings has written a true
 animated, interactive baccarat simulation and the full featured program can be
 played with up to three computer generated players.  A nice touch are the
 comments, and the expressions on the faces, of the animated players.  If you
 take some time placing your bet, the old man will doze off on you.  Accidental
 Software pokes fun at itself with their motto "If it's good it's accidental,"
 but the reality is that they have an entire line of wonderful Shareware casino
 games.

 Ultimate Baccarat includes a comprehensive tutor to help players learn the
 rules of the game, an option which can be toggled on or off.  When using the
 tutor a large curtain drops down in the center of the game screen and the
 player will be provided with an explanation of the game as it proceeds.  Each
 step in the game play is explained.  There is also a "Baccarat Info" option
 which provides general information concerning baccarat, commissions, game
 play, payoffs and a table of rules governing card draws.  There are options to
 display the statistics and results for each player at the table.  So, the
 program does furnish everything needed to learn this mis-understood casino
 game.

 The benefits of registering Ultimate Baccarat include the elimination of the
 on-screen registration reminders, the ability to save all game information,
 to play with up to six human players at one time, Sound Blaster support is
 provided and with the optional voice support you can hear digital recordings
 of the words seen in the talk balloons.  The one complaint with the Shareware
 version, but it is a pretty good incentive to pay the $13.00 registration, is
 that no sound card support is provided.  It would be interesting to hear,
 rather than read, the sometimes hilarious comments of the computer players.

 Baccarat has always been the casino's class game with an appeal to the high-
 rollers.  Until recently, the casinos seemed quite satisfied with perpetrating
 that intrigue.  Black-tie baccarat, with casino personnel in formal attire, is
 intimating to many people.  In an effort to entice some to try the fastest
 game in town, the casinos employ attractive young ladies to sit at the
 baccarat tables to get the game started.  The casinos call them starters, but
 they are more commonly referred to as shills.  While this was the predominant
 approach in the past, it was not that successful in developing a new
 generation of baccarat players.  Over the last decade, the casinos have taken
 a different approach by placing some mini-baccarat tables on the casino floor.
 These tables are slightly larger than a blackjack table and are designed for
 seven players instead of the more traditional twelve players.  Since mini-
 baccarat tables have lower minimum bets, it does give more people exposure to
 the "Big Nine Game" of baccarat.

 The casinos are at a cross-roads and have no choice but to try to generate
 interest in the traditional casino games.  It is getting to the point that it
 is difficult to distinguish between a major casino and a video arcade.  When
 the trend is trading in gaming tables for video games and trying to turn Las
 Vegas into kiddie land, you have to wonder just how much longer more
 traditional casino games like baccarat will be around.  The casinos are
 concerned and do worry about where the next generation of gamers will come
 from.  They are even gambling with their traditional base of support by trying
 to make an adult playground into a family vacation destination.  It may not be
 realistic to think that this will be the salvation of the gaming industry, but
 only time will tell how long this diametrical approach will survive.

 Ultimate Software's Casino Game Machines
 ----------------------------------------

 Game machines are the latest rage in all the gambling establishments.  In many
 cases, casinos are removing gaming tables to put in additional machines.  Upon
 entering a casino, the first thing you notice is the loud noises associated
 with these game machines.  The casinos love the machines, as the noise draws
 attention to the gaming floor and it also distracts those sitting at the
 tables.  Whether replacing tables with machines will help the industry is not
 really the scope of this article, but much has been written on how the casinos
 are losing their traditional support base.  The scope of this article is to
 look at a collection of casino game machine programs for Windows.

 Ultimate Software, based in Central Point, Oregon, has produced a collection
 of seven casino game machines.  The programs, written by Mike Comish and
 distributed through the Shareware market, are written for Windows and require
 the file VBRUN300.DDL to operate.  Recently, Windows 95 versions of the games
 have been released.  The collection includes three slot machine games, Cherry
 Delights Video Slots, Lucky Stars Video Slots and Double Dynamite Video Slots.
 Real Video Poker, Real Video Blackjack, Noisy Video Poker and Blackjack, and
 Slots of Trivia round out the collection.

 The description file for the slot machine programs claim:  "This isn't your
 grandmother's slot machine!"  The slot machines each have nine wheels, three
 row of three, and eight different ways to win.  You can win vertically,
 horizontally, or diagonally.  Up to eight coins may be bet on each way to win,
 so a total of 64 coins can be wagered on a single spin.  The programs have the
 option of changing background colors, setting the speed, having all the wheels
 stop at the same time and you can also borrow credits.  The optional sound
 card support adds the digitized sounds of the coins being feed into the
 machine and a click when the wheels stop.  There is the additional feature of
 a statistics option in the registered version.

 The main difference in the three games, other than the colors, are the items
 found on the wheels.  All three have bonus spins and a progressive pool bonus.
 The wheels on Cherry Delights Video Slots feature cherries, bells, grapes,
 watermelons, 7's, plums and lemons.  Lucky Stars Video Slots' wheels have
 watermelons, stars, lemons, cherries, grapes, lightning bolts and apples.  The
 wheels on Double Dynamite Video Slots feature sticks of dynamite, happy faces,
 targets, stop signs, traffic signal walk lights, outlines of the United States
 with a U.S. flag overlay, outlines of Canada with a Canadian flag overlay and
 the Earth.

 The video slot machine programs include a very nice payoff chart, which is a
 table that shows up as a window to the right of the main window.  When you
 win, another window pops up with a table of your winnings.  The registered
 version has the option of doubling down on winning spins, which is betting
 your winnings in a hi-lo poker game.  All the slot machines have a similar
 look and feel, however, the movement of the wheels is a bit jerky and does not
 give a true spinning feeling.  The Ultimate Software collection of video slot
 machines can be registered for $20 each, two for $30, or all three programs
 for $35.

 There was a time when casinos only offered the mechanical one arm bandit slot
 machines, but in this technological age there are a wide range of gaming
 machines appearing.  Traditionally, the most popular are the video poker and
 video blackjack machines.  With a video poker program, a video blackjack
 program, and a program which has both poker and blackjack, Ultimate Software's
 collection of gaming machines reflects this trend.  Just like the video slot
 machines, these programs run under Windows and require VBRUN300.DDL to
 operate.

 The Shareware version of Real Video Poker is based on the traditional jacks or
 better video poker machines.  Registration adds two new games, Joker's Wild
 and Deuces Wild poker, along with the ability to use cheat codes to hit hands
 such as a Royal Flush.  You may play up to four coins in the Shareware version
 and registration allows for playing five coins.  Winning hands are highlighted
 on the payoff table, so the payoff can be determined quickly.  This is a nice
 rendition of the popular casino machine, with an easy to use interface and
 sound card support.

 Real Video Blackjack is based on the video blackjack machines found in most
 casinos, which are based on the popular table game of twenty-one.  In the
 Shareware version you only have the option of betting $1, however, the
 registered version lets the player wager up to $10.  An insurance window is
 displayed whenever the dealer has an ace showing, but the option of taking
 insurance is not available in the Shareware version.  The Shareware version
 does not allow the player to spilt cards, or display the current statistics.
 Registration also adds more sounds to the game, including the shuffling of the
 cards.  The program explains the basic strategy of the game and has an easy to
 use interface.

 Noisy Video Poker and Blackjack is basically a combination of the other two
 video card games, but offers more sound effects.  The sound effects include
 upbeat music when you win a hand, the sound of the cards hitting the table and
 the clanking of winnings dropping into the metal coin tray.  When you lose a
 hand you will hear, among other effects, pig grunting, gun shots, or breaking
 glass.  The description file distributed with the program rightfully claims:
 "The included sounds make even losing fun."

 Ultimate Software's latest release, Slots of Trivia, is a combination slot
 machine and trivia game, which is not a typical game found in the casinos, but
 is included here.  The program acts very much like a slot machine game, until
 two of the same objects show up on the wheel.  A trivia question is then
 displayed and a correct answer will earn extra credits.  Look for more about
 Slots of Trivia in a review in this issue.

 PBM Flashback - November 1993
 -----------------------------

 This month we cheat a bit.  Instead of looking back to a past September issue,
 this month's PBM Flashback reflects back to the November 1993 issue.  An
 article titled "The BBSCON Day Two" talked about some of the happenings
 surrounding ONE BBSCON '93.  One of the things surrounding that convention,
 which took place in suburban Colorado Springs, was legalized casino gambling
 in nearby Cripple Creek.  After the on-line show was held, the editor of this
 publication made a short visit to this historic Colorado town.  The following
 is what was written about that visit three years ago.

 Many of the BBSCON guests took time to take in the local sights, including
 sampling limited stakes gambling in nearby Cripple Creek.  In November of
 1990 Colorado voters authorized limited stakes gambling in several old mining
 towns.  Since October of 1991 Cripple Creek, along with Central City and Black
 Hawk outside of Denver, now bristle with activity.  The effort has not been
 without it's growing pains.  There are strict zoning restrictions in Cripple
 Creek, primarily to maintain the historic look of the town, and these
 restrictions are hampering growth.  Large casino operators want to move into
 the area, but locals want to preserve the national historic status of the
 town.  Last year Federal officials threatened to revoke the historic status if
 new construction started ruining the character of Cripple Creek.  There are
 still some bugs to work out, but Cripple Creek residents feel Governor Roy
 Romer is the primary problem.  Governor Romer is a longtime opponent of
 legalized gambling and didn't even visit the casinos during their first two
 years of operation.

 Driving west out of Colorado Springs on US 24 gives a magnificent view of one
 of the world's most famous mountains, Pike's Peak.  The peak was first sighted
 by Zebulon Montgomery Pike, an American explorer and army officer, in 1806.
 The mountain's elevation is not the highest in the state, 14,100 feet, but it
 is well-known for the annual auto race and an exceptional view.  The Pike's
 Peak Auto Hill Climb dates back to 1916, and it is the second oldest race in
 the United States after the Indianapolis 500.  Spencer Penrose, builder of the
 Broadmoor Hotel, first staged the international event to publicize the region.
 Some very big names in the world of auto racing have raced in the Fourth of
 July event, the likes of Mario Andretti, Bobby Unser, Rick Mears and Parnelli
 Jones.  There was snow in the higher elevations, which did disappoint some by
 closing down the Pike's Peak Highway for awhile.  The leaves were just barely
 starting to change color, how wonderful this area must look in the fall.
 Something I had not personally seen in a while were birch trees.

 Driving in Colorado can be a bit of an experience.  State Road 67, which heads
 south towards Cripple Creek, is the type of road that one would expect to find
 in the mountains.  It is all two lane paved road, but there are treacherous
 mountain curves and drop-offs of thousands of feet.  The Colorado Department
 of Transportation doesn't waste any money on things like signage or guard-
 rail.  The road can be dangerous when the locals try to pass the pokey
 tourists, as there may be a lot of right-of-way, but unfortunately it is
 straight down.  I would also think Colorado's drunk driver problem would
 correct itself.  One tip for those who may be renting a car in the mountains,
 bring a cassette tape or two.

 Cripple Creek sits at an elevation of 9,494 feet and has an ice cream parlor
 advertising "Two Mile High Ice Cones."  It is no Las Vegas, and it is hard to
 call something without a craps table a casino, but Cripple Creek is well worth
 the trip.  The limited stakes, $5 maximum bet, blackjack, poker and various
 slots, can be frustrating.  When you start winning the natural tendency is to
 start increasing your bets, but the limit makes it hard to win big.  If I was
 in Las Vegas I would have played a few large hands right before leaving town,
 in an attempt to pay for the trip.  However, with the $5 limit, and the fact I
 had a plane to catch, I just cashed in my pocket full of green $25 chips.  It
 is probably the state's loss, as I would have played green until I had won
 substantially, or lost all my winnings.  Despite paying $90 for a room without
 air conditioning, and dealing with the frustration of trying to park, Cripple
 Creek was a great way to relax and forget about bulletin boards for a while.

 Editor's Note:  PBM Flashback will appear on a regular basis in future issues.
 Each issue will have this brief look back at some of the features which have
 appeared over the history of the Pasco BBS Magazine.

 EFF Quote of the Month
 ----------------------

 "There happened in the Middle Ages what has happened so often since then.
 Those who were the beneficiaries of the established order were bent on
 defending it, not so much, perhaps, because it guaranteed their interests, as
 because it seemed to them indispensable to the preservation of society."

 - Henri Pirenne, _Medieval_Cities, _Their_Origins_and_the_Revival_of_Trade_,

 After six years in print, "BBS Magazine" ceased publication with the June 1996
 issue.  The publication was known as BBS Caller's Digest from its inception in
 1988, as an on-line magazine for Sysops to put on their bulletin boards, until
 being renamed in 1994.  The first printed issue came out in September 1990 and
 the first six issues were created on Word Perfect at the publisher's house.
 The publisher of BBS Magazine was Richard Paquette, who is the Sysop of the
 Livewire BBS and the author of the Livewire Collection of BBS door programs.
 At its peak, BBS Magazine has a paid circulation in excess of 40,000.  An
 exclusive interview with Richard Paquette appeared in the March 1994 issue of
 the Pasco BBS Magazine.

 Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director John Deutch told a Senate
 subcommittee that the government and industry should prepare for "cyber-
 warfare" attacks on their computers by other countries.  It is felt that
 systems are very vulnerable and that security controls cannot prevent hackers
 from accessing systems.

 At a recent campaign stop President Bill Clinton proposed putting the names of
 "deadbeat" parents on the Internet.  About twenty states currently have Web

 The Florida Division of Elections has made it possible for people to register
 to vote on the Internet's World Wide Web.  Those who register on-line will be
 sent an official form to sign in the mail.  The site, which was setup in an
 attempt to get more younger voters registered, may be accessed at

 On August 7, 1996, Microsoft released version 4.0 of Windows NT.  Three years
 ago Windows NT 3.1 debuted, as an operating system for networks, databases and
 specialized applications.  NT meant "New Technology" and the first version
 spent four years in development with costs nearing $500 million.  The initial
 release did not fair too well, but eventually the program did gain some level
 of acceptance and is currently installed on almost a fifth of the computers
 acting as "servers."  This new version takes on more of a Windows 95
 appearance.

 Blackjack for Professionals Review
 ----------------------------------

 Larry Brenner is a New Port Richey, Florida resident who has written a
 blackjack simulation, which he calls "an analysis, practice and learning
 tool."  Blackjack for Professionals features no graphics, but is designed to
 analyze and summarize the users style of play.  The program is not a tutorial
 on blackjack and assumes a basic understanding of the popular casino card
 game, however, there is much flexibility in the program.

 There are a wide range of configuration options available, such as, the number
 of decks to use and the percentage of the deck to penetrate prior to
 shuffling.  The play options allow the program to be setup like any casino, as
 it is possible to change the options for doubling down, splits, doubling after
 splits, surrender, insurance and when the dealer checks his hole card.  The
 starting bankroll for the player and house, betting units, speed and sound can
 also be configured to personal preference.  There is also the option of using
 the built-in card counting methods, Plus-Minus and Hi-Opt, or to use your own
 custom method.

 While the beta version 1.00 was used for this review, Blackjack for
 Professionals seems to be well on the way to reaching the stated objectives.

 Reading Text Files

 We've all seen those files that with funny titles like README, or READ.ME or
 README.1ST.

 Did you ever wonder about them?  Of course you did.  And well you should.
 Such files have a lot of information in them.  Sometimes it's about how to run
 the program or how to use it.  In some cases, they have up-to-date information
 not included in the manual.  So, it behooves one to read those files.  How??

 There are a few ways.  The first, and the easiest is to the DOS TYPE command.
 To use this command assuming we have a filename such as READ.ME, simply type:

 TYPE  READ.ME

 Unfortunately, if the text is a long one, it will scroll past you too fast to
 read.  TYPE is a good command for short texts, but not for long ones.  For a
 longer text, we must use the  "pipe".  If you look on your keyboard at the key
 with the back-slash symbol (\) you will see a symbol like this |.  That is the
 pipe symbol.  One of the many things a pipe does is interrupt action.  In
 this case, it interrupts the scrolling.  To use it, type:

 TYPE READ.ME | MORE

 Now, you will see just one screenful of text.  To see the next screenful,
 press the PAGE DOWN key, and so on.

 There's another easy way.  Just type:  MORE < READ.ME

 This does the same thing as above, one screenful at a time.  (You'll find the
 < symbol on the key with the comma (,))

 So much for the DOS commands.  There is an excellent shareware program that
 works even better, called LIST, which you can find in computer club libraries,
 or download it from a bulletin board.  If you have downloaded it from a
 Bulletin Board, you will have to Unzip it.  You will find a document file,
 which tells you how to use LIST, plus 3 files called LIST, LISTR, & LISTS.
 For the time being, it is best to use LISTS (short version).  To read the
 LIST.DOC file, type LISTS LIST.DOC.  This will give you the documentation, one
 screenful at a time.  When finished, just press ESC to get back to DOS.

 In reading the documentation, you will find a number of uses for LIST.
 Experiment later.  For now, just use it to read text files.

 month's issue.  Ed Garwood may be contacted by leaving a message on the Board

 Slots of Trivia Review
 ----------------------

 Slots of Trivia is a game for Windows, which is a combination slot machine and
 trivia game.  The program is written by Mike Comish and distributed by Central
 Point, Oregon based Ultimate Software.  There are several different Slots of
 Trivia versions available, including Sport Trivia, General Knowledge Trivia,
 Baseball Trivia and Movie Trivia.  The program does require that the readily
 available VBRUN300.DLL file be placed in the Windows's system directory.

 The Sport Trivia version of Slots of Trivia was used for this review.  The
 objects displayed on the wheels reflect this version, as you watch golf balls,
 footballs, basketballs, tennis balls, hockey pucks and trophies spin.  This
 program acts very much like a slot machine game, until two of the same objects
 show up on the wheel.  A trivia question is then displayed and a correct
 answer will earn extra credits.  While there is the option of a slot-only mode
 without trivia questions, the questions do add more challenge to the game.
 One nice feature is a bonus pool, which increases with each bet.  Correctly
 answer one question from each category to win the bonus pool.  Other options
 include borrowing from the bank, setting the speed of the game, changing the
 color scheme and switching the level of difficulty.

 As with the other programs in the Ultimate Software library, Slots of Trivia
 is very well done.

 Next Month
 ----------

 While we are not sure of everything that will appear in the October issue,
 several things are in the works.  Next month's issue will have coverage of
 CyberSurfari '96, which will be put on by the Software Publishers Association
 in October.  Another October event is national "NetDay" on October 26, so we
 will have something on that too.  Also planned is another extraction from
 June's highly publicized ruling in the case against the Communications Decency
 Act.  Look for Computer Basics, Shareware reviews, all the latest news and our
 other regular features.

 The October issue of the Pasco BBS Magazine will be available on, or before,
 September 22.  Make sure you do not miss a single issue of Tampa Bay's oldest
 free on-line magazine!
