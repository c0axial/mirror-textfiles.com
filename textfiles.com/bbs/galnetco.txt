    The following are Galactic Net conference rules and regulations. 
    It is our hope that these serve as a guidline to participating 
    Sysops.
    
    We attempted to create a network free of intense policies and
    harassing regulations. These descriptions and their accompanying
    rules are in our eyes reasonable.

    As new conferences are sponsored, individual moderators will be
    required to develop their own conference rules and regulations,
    for inclusion in this file.

    The following guidelines are for problem situations that may occur.

       If a problem occurs between users the moderator must handle the 
      situation with a NON-biased view. Look at both sides if need be 
      and settle the argument.
    
       The Galactic Net Administrator has the final say on ANY matter involving
       Users, Visiting SysOps, Galactic Net SysOps, Moderators, Coordinators,  
       Hubs, or the Net itself. All decisions are final.
