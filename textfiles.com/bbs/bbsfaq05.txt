ABOUT FIRSTCLASS
------------------
FirstClass is a multi-platform communications system that integrates
full fledged e-mail with workgroup communication services and offers
the same ease of use, functionality and high performance over network

in one integrated system:
 
- Complete office electronic mail
- Network conferencing for electronic discussions
- Remote-access or network bulletin board system (BBS)

Of course one of the primary reasons to use FirstClass as an on-line
system lies in the strength of its multitasking graphical interface.

(in both directions simultaneously) even while reading mail, chatting
or using other system features.
 
FirstClass as a BBS , has the ability to access and search CD-ROMS or
other volumes on-line is very useful, as is the ability to send mail
to any user or conference the BBS user has permission to.  
Administrators may accurately track what users have uploaded or
downloaded what through statistics and billing features.  They can
create custom icons and background pictures.  Accommodate users of
any computer type through a command-line interface to FirstClass
