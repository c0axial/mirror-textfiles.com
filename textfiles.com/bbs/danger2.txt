...continued from previous message:

        I realize that everything I have told you is rather vague and if
you do not already have an understanding of how computer bulletin boards
operate, that all of this is very confusing.  For the moment, it is
probably enough jhust to know that this sort of thing exists.  If you
realize that, you can at least keep an eye out for unusual telephone
numbers, unexplained long distance phone calls on your monthly bill and
perhaps become suspicious when you hear of someone (whether an adult or
a child) who seems to be addicted to his or her computer.  You should
also keep in mind that computer bulletin boards are a wonderfuly
communications tool and that the vast majority are completely legitimate
and well intentioned.  But, just like anything else, they are subject to
corruption by the criminal element are are easily transformed into
effective criminal implements.  The inherent danger of computer bulletin
boards - above and beyond many other forms of communication - is the
fact that computers are intensely private.  Unless you are standing over
the shoulder of the computer operator and reading the screen, you have
no idea what is being silently transmitted into your home.

        In closing, I would like to ask you for your help.  I am
attempting to identify and investigate as many computer bulletin boards
as I can, no matter where they are located.  I am being joined in the
effort by a number of law enforcement agencies around the country and we
are pooling our information in an effort to disrupt this network of
criminal activity. Therefore, if you become aware of any BBS telephone
numbers (or even just the name of any BBS), I would appreciate it if you
could pass this information on to me.  I will of course keep all of the
information confidential.  I can be reached by phone number on the other
side of this handout, or you can simply drop the information into the
mail.  You may also contact me if you would like additional information
on the dangers of computer bulletin boards, or if you would like me to
lecture your group on the subject and provide you with a visual
demonstration.

        Thank you for taking the time to read this and I appreciate any
help you can give us.

                                Sincerely,
                                Alfred O. Olsen

                *****SOME CHILD BEHAVIORAL WARNING SIGNS****

*COMPUTER ADDICTION*

(WITHDRAWS FROM FRIENDS, FAMILY, ETC.) MAY LOSE INTEREST IN SOCIAL
ACTIVITIES USE OF NEW (UNUSUAL) VOCABULARY, HEAVY WITH COMPUTER TERMS,
SATANIC PHRASES OR SEXUAL REFERENCE (OR SUDDEN INTEREST IN RELATED
POSTERS, MUSIC, ETC) LOOK FOR RELATED DOODLING OR WRITING.

USE OF WORDS SUCH AS: HACKING, PHREAKING (OR ANY WORDS WITH "PH"
REPLACING "F")

LACK OF INTEREST IN SELF AND APPEARANCE OR INDICATIONS OF LACK OF SLEEP

                        *OTHER POTENTIAL DANGER SIGNS*

COMPUTER AND MODEM RUNNING LATE AT NIGHT (EVEN WHILE UNATTENDED)

STORING OF COMPUTER FILES ENDING IN:  PCX, GIF, TIF, DL, GL
(THESE ARE VIDEO OR GRAPHIC IMAGE FILES AND PARENTS SHOULD KNOW
WHAT THEY ILLUSTRATE) Comment - These files are usually viewed with an
executable program as follows: "SEE.EXE", "GRASPRT.EXE".  To view a file
with the extension, as noted above (e.g. GIF), let us assume the program
is called "SMUT.GIF".  You simply type, at the "C:\" promt, "See smut.gif",
or "grasprt smut.gif".  You will soon know if your child is downloading
pornagraphy.

NAMES ON COMMUNICATIONS PROGRAMS WHICH SEEM SATANIC OR PORNOGRAPHIC

OBSESSION WITH FANTASY ADVENTURE GAMES (DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS, TRADE WARS,
SEXCAPADE, ETC).

USE OF COMPUTER TO SCAN OR RUN TELEPHONE NUMBERS (e.g. Demon Dialer)
OR CREDIT CARD NUMBERS (LOOK FOR "SEQUENTIAL DIALING PROGRAMS) Comment -
I have personally encountered Demon Dialers and programs for checking the
validity of credit card numbers, in the Lower Mainland.
