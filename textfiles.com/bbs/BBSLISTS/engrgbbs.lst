The Computer Plumber BBS is pleased to present the following directory
of 125 Engineering-Oriented Bulletin Board Systems.

If you know of a bulletin board system that is strong on engineering or
scientific subjects or have more information on those listed, please
leave a comment to Art Petrzelka (SYSOP) on The Computer Plumber BBS at
319-337-6723, to apetrzelka on BIX, or 76320,204 on Compuserve.

There are many different types of Engineering Bulletin Boards, just as
there are many different types of engineers.

There are three types of boards listed in this directory:
   - Engineering-related BBSs,
   - Product support boards, and
   - Other BBS resources of use to engineers.

Unless otherwise noted, all entries operate 24 hours a day, and can
be accessed at 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity (8N1) at full
duplex.

The Circuit Cellar BBS was first established to support the projects
presented by Steve Ciarcia in his Ciarcia's Circuit Cellar articles
formerly found in BYTE magazine.  Upon leaving BYTE, Steve started
his own magazine called Circuit Cellar INK.  The Circuit Cellar BBS
continues its committment to supporting all those involved in computers
and electronics at both the hardware and the software level.  The BBS
hosts numerous conferences containing discussions ranging from embedded
con- trollers to using electronics to induce different dream states.
File areas contain collections of engineering and cross-development
tools not often available from a single source.

protection.  Standards exist by which all historically and
architecturally significant structures should be repaired, replaced and

  A friend (whom I have never met) once found his similar effort in a
book in a bookstore, with no credit given to him, or any indication of
how to keep the list going. I hope that this copyright effort is a waste
of time, and evidence of paranoia. :-)
  I started doing this because of the difficulty I had in finding these
systems. I'd like to find more and let other engineers know about them.
  The number one goal of this file is to get engineers talking to each
other.
