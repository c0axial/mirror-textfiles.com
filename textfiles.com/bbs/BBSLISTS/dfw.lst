 Note: Every system in this listing of online services was placed here by the
       Sysop of that system. The responsibility for changed or disconnected
       numbers lies with the names associated with the numbers. Unlike other
       lists that use automated doors to enter and verify bbs numbers, we
       too have used such programs and found them to allow non-bbs numbers
       to be added to the list. They also remove a working bbs from the list
       if the auto-verifier happens to call when your bbs is down for system
       maintenence or other reasons.  At DFW.ZIP we have used a similar
       automated feature in years past; now we find that we retain more
       accuracy by personally checking list entries for bogus numbers and
       down systems.  Don't be fooled by overhyped bbs doors which produce
       inaccuracies in the bbs lists they generate!

                           BUM STEER AWARDS
                            April    1996


  Number One to Stan Abercrombie - aka "The Bandit".  This person is well-
  known to menace callers "voice" PARTICULARLY females, who he will
  harrass at all hours once he weasles a phone number from them. He
  has been reported to phone companies time and time again, but always
  seems to reappear with or without running his own BBS. A genuine
  problem-causer to BBS-land since the mid 80's: anyone who has come
  into contact with Stan will have personal horror stories. Avoid him.

  Number Two to Texas Metronet - the Internet provider.  Do not own a
  computer to run their husband/wife business from; they leech off of the
  local University mainframe (like the FREE lonestar.org) but THEY CHARGE
  people for it. Act like customer service is a god given favor which they
  should be paid extra for. Wife/Accounting department keeps track of
  customer service questions as if she should charge customers for each.
  Technical support is nominally okay until accounting hears about it.

  Number Three to local FIDO politics.  In D/FW it seems customary to have
  a mandatory change of hub sites every couple of months.  This does not
  include the regular "elections" where the same group of cheerleaders take
  turns electing each other local beauty queen. FIDOnet itself is a great
  and wonderful thing. The personalities of the "inner circle" are not.

  Number Four goes to the ba-jillions of folks who believe all the hype
  that they are going to be able to make instant millions running a
  business on the Internet, even though they have never dialed a modem or
  contacted a single BBS in their life.  After time and effort these Hungry
  Hippos find out they have a very expensive paperweight on their desks and
  that most 12 year old sysops run a better online service than the
  "business" folks could ever pull off, Internet or no.

  Number Five goes to Incredible Universe and CompUSA.  Both treat you with
  swarming staff (3-5 tee-shirted employeees per customer) who will ALWAYS
  tell you ANYTHING to make a sale. Examples: "Of COURSE hard drive space
  and RAM memory are the same thing. Especially under Windows!" or "Yes sir
  this 2400 modem is just as good as the expensive ones!" or "Just go home
  and plug in this modem and you are on the Internet!" or "Yes, your SVGA
  monitor NEEDS this whole wall of Screen Savers". Ask them to show you ANY
  VGA monitor that has had an image burned into the screen from not using
  screen savers.

 ออออออออออออออออออ  HOW  TO  GET  YOUR  BBS  LISTED  ออออออออออออออออ


   This listing has been updated daily by the input of ALL the sysops
 in Dallas/Fort Worth, and manually edited each weekend by Mark Robbins.
 Sysop information is added to the bbs list via the SYSOP SURVEY. This survey
 is found in DFW.ZIP as SYSOP.FRM.  Fill it out and return it by Netmail or
 Internet to mark.robbins@ssanctum.com or 1:130/607. You can call direct to
 the source - SECOND SANCTUM - at metro 817 467-1175 to use the SURVEY there.
 Internet users, contact info@ssanctum.com for more info.

   Creating dialing directories for your communication program:

   1. Support is given via Henry Clark's FONDIR software. You may
      download FONDIR and import the newest list into it... however
      Henry Clark no longer has a bbs to support this product.

   2. We recommend the use of "TERMINATE" modem software to easily
      import this list into your dialing directory.

************************** IMPORTANT  INFO *******************************

    There are now several different bbs lists floating around DFW.
   Some of these are made by generic, shareware list-generating "door"
   programs, and as bbs lists go they are pretty nice (when new). Most of
   the generic bbs listing programs are not kept updated with "Down" or
   "Moved" systems on a consistent basis, and keeping such systems on a list
   can become a detriment. Many old lists circulate disconnected numbers as
   if they were current - and cause problems doing so, especially at night.

    This, the OLDEST CONTINUOUS listing of online services for D/FW, is
   edited constantly by the input of local sysops - for NEW and ESTABLISHED
   bbs systems - as well as changed and "down" numbers. The choice is yours!

 Many other bbs's and tabloids (who rename themselves and move frequently
 for some reason) tend to "borrow" the contents of this list for later
 publication under differnt names. While imitation is the highest form of
 flattery, SECOND SANCTUM's bbs list has remained the most accurate, most
 popularly used bbs list in Texas for two simple reasons:

  1)  This is the oldest continuous bbs list in the state of Texas and
      has been consistently updated with regularity since 1982. It is
      completely "BY for FOR All D/FW Sysops" who personally contribute
      all of the information to the list.

  2)  It has always been, and always will be -- 100% FREE -- and easily
      distributed. The copycats and tabloids want you to PAY for your
      submission of info about your system. DFW.ZIP has and always will
      provide unlimited space FOR FREE to provide each sysop with space
      to describe the online services offered at a given system. WHY PAY
      to be included in a list or publication which still shows numbers
      which were disconnected in 1990?  DFW.ZIP gives you the best for FREE!

   1. The Dallas/Fort Worth BBS List is a PUBLIC SERVICE to all bbs
      callers out there. A great deal of time is spent editing and
      updating this list, and EVERY EFFORT is made to list boards
      according to the wishes of each SysOp (as we have traditionally
      done for years!) The point in the existence of this listing is to
      HELP YOU, the modem user seeking CURRENT bbs numbers.

   2. We are not responsible for any incorrect information in the
      list. Hate-mail and rudeness is not the way to make a change to
      this listing. THIS LISTING IS FREE, IMPOLITE COMPLAINTS WILL BE
      POLITELY IGNORED. You have been provided instant access to make
      changes to this list; it is 100% up to YOU to make any necessary
      changes (particularly moved or "down" systems).

                    L I S T    P O L I C Y

   1. No board which participates in ANY sort of illegal activity
      may be listed. This causes a bad image for all boards, we will
      not support it.

   2. Adult or sexually-oriented boards (or those which contain
      messages and files of a sexual nature) must restrict all users
      under age 18 if they wish to be listed on the DFW BBS List.

   3. Handles, fake names, alter egos will NOT be listed as SysOp
      name on this list. If a person cannot use a real name in the
      association of his own bbs, we must suspect illegal activity is
      the reason for hiding behind a false name. (On your board, such
      "handles" may be normal for the way you run your system - but on
      a legitimate, widely distributed listing, we must insist upon the
      credibility afforded by your REAL NAME).

   4. "THE" and "BBS" are not suitable words in the name of any bbs
       system. Why is that? Every number on these pages is a BBS. There
       is no need to be redundant and list "BBS" as part of the system
       name. As for "THE", all lists are maintained alphabetically.
       While you may name your bbs "THE BOARD", such nomenclature would
       have us list every known bbs under the letter "T". In order to
       list systems correctly, and making them easier to find, we place
       those obligatory "THE" words directly after the system name,
       separated by a comma.


                     LISTING  BY  SOFTWARE  TYPE

   Most people who have used a modem and BBS long enough to be
   roughly familiar with such online systems, are looking at bbs
   lists for boards they will enjoy. Tastes vary! Some like playing
   games, some like serious discussions, some like programming and
   reference. Not many people like ALL these; as personalities go.
   With that in mind:

   Most people who are somewhat used to this medium are ALREADY
   FAMILIAR with types of bbs software, and most are comfortable
   with one or two specific kinds of bbs software. For example, a
   person interested in getting reference information will only be
   wasting his/her time by calling a board featuring mostly games or
   nudie graphics/online graffiti in the message base.

   It is much easier for a bbs caller (with any degree of online
   experience) to find the types of boards he/she enjoys, by looking
   at the available SOFTWARE TYPES. The names of bbs's often tell
   little or nothing about what the board is about. However, when
   you see a board running under a given type of software, you have
   a much better idea of what to expect - and therefore, you do not
   waste as much time calling boards that you would have little (or
   no) interest in.

   While others may prefer to see a listing of bbs names and numbers
   alone, we have found over the years that classifying boards by
   software type is most helpful to callers who know what they want
   out of a bbs - and which bbs's they wish to avoid out of personal
   preference.
