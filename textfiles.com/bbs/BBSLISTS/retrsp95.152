The files in the Retsof Texas AC 512 Austin Area BBS list are changed
daily.  Later uploads get new versions.  I add a `*' code if I have
verified that local boards have the list available for download.  The
outer filename changes monthly and ranges from RETSOF01.ZIP to
RETSOF12.ZIP.  RETSOF12 is superseded by RETSOF01 the following year.
My new scheme for Camel's Back lists is A512ymmx.ZIP to gain more exposure.
Get real.  Do not use any BBSlist from anywhere that is more than
90 days old.  They degrade about 1% per day and many boards are gone.

The most recent monthly BBS list is available to long distance callers
without the need of going through a registration process.  Camel's
Back BBS has 5 high speed lines available at 1-512-243-0077.  This
number is listed in the BBS Lister section of Boardwatch Magazine.
Further refreshes during the month will be found in the new file
section as RETSyydd.ZIP.  Please change the outer name to RETSOFmm.ZIP
(or whatever compression method) (if you put the refreshed file on your
system.

It is distributed automatically by file TIC from Balcones Fault Line to
most Austin hubs and then to most nodes and points in net 382, mass
e-mailed to VBBS boards in Area Code 512, posted to alt.bbs.lists,
sent to Houston for the Internet Gopher, forwarded to the Fidonet
Filebone by 1:382/1 for worldwide Filebone distribution, is published in
Austin Tech-Connected monthly newpaper and Texas Computing Magazine,
and is uploaded by me to other netted and independent
IBM/Macintosh/Amiga/Atari/Apple boards in the Austin Wide Area Exchange.
Text or g-file versions are on many boards for online capture or download,
including After Hours 32 line chat board at 1-512-320-1650.

If you don't get one, it's your own fault.
Sending up to 100 pages of multiple files in this BBS list by FAX
is not practical, so forget it.

I call bulletin boards in the Austin Wide Area Exchange and am registered
on most of the 300 local systems. It takes a while to get around to all of
them, so respond in one of the BBS echos if you have something changing.
Some of sysops want to advertise, others wait for me to dig them out, but
few say anything when they get tired of running a BBS.

I include information for Corpus Christi,
Victoria, Kingsville, Georgetown, and elsewhere in the area code.
(Independent non-netted BBS information from outside the Austin
area is greatly appreciated, since bulletin boards are so volatile,
and calls within the area code are expensive.  This information should
be provided every 2-3 months, so I will not think that the BBS went down.)
If your information is accurate in Fidonet, WWIVnet, or Virtualnet
nodelists, I will find it weekly.  However, if you are a mail-only node,
I will not list your BBS unless you provide an additional public number
for human callers.

    I ONLY WANT TEXAS AREA CODE 512, not anything else.
Out-of-Austin callers may call the Texas Computing BBS at 1-800-890-2038.
This is a free BBS and a free call.  Leave your BBS info there.

If you want to change your listing or add some specialties,
post a summary on a wide area echo available in Austin, send e-mail
to John Foster on most Fidonet boards in 1:382/__, e-mail
Retsof on most Austin WWIV or VBBS boards,
post an advertising message to Fidonet Austin BBSINFO and/or
WWIV BBS info or Virtual net BBS info echos (RECOMMENDED!
so callers will see also)
send an internet message to john.foster@camel.com, call voice
to 1-512-346-8253 or mail to
RETSOFtware BBSlist Dept.

I get many callers who for some reason cannot use an answering machine
or interact with a real person, so having a BBS online for users that
have never called one is out of the question.

If calls rollover to other lines, only one entry is needed, but if you
have more than one class of modem, callers would appreciate knowing
which number to use for that modem to maximize.

Modem proprietary codes from RETHSM(high speed) or RETABL
#s is number of rotary lines (hunt group) accessed from this number
min.bps is minimum bits per second rate you permit on this line
bps rate is lower basic DCE carrier speed, not higher DTE bit rate.
