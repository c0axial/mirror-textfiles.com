* Systems that allow a first time caller to download 96LIST.

@ SysOps - if you are willing to call the DOWNTOWN BBS to pick up and help 
  distribute 96LIST, call in on the [ugh] 2400 line listed above, create an
  account for yourself and leave e-mail to User_ID Sysop. Usually within one
  day, you'll be given a new account and password to access the 9600+ lines
  for further calls to pick up 96LIST as a complimentary subscriber.
  You should also indicate your listing information for 96SOURCE.LST (you can 
  include a SHORT one line ad).
  Do NOT call these numbers until then - they will not recognize non-subscriber
  User_IDs.

 For those of you on networks, 96LIST is uploaded to Sleepy Hollow BBS, the US
 UN'I Net Hub in Beverly Hills, CA and arrangements are being made to have
 96LIST available for FidoNet FREQ'ing at The Complete Package (1:102/526).
