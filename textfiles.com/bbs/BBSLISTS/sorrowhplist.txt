Message #2588 - CCI: Hack/Phreak Basic 
   Date: 05-22-93 09:19
   From: Midnight Sorrow
     To: All
Subject: Advanced H/P

Here is a list I made, of all the systems who will have access to CyberCrime
Advanced H/P.  Only pure H/P systems, or systems with EXTREMELY high quality H/P users, may have access to this base.

REGIONAL HOSTS:  PLEASE GO THROUGH YOUR CONNECTIONS LIST FOR INF-AHP, AND VERIFY THAT >ONLY< THESE SYSTEMS ARE RECEIVING THIS BASE FROM YOU.  REMOVE ANY AND ALL OTHERS THAT ARE NOT AUTHORIZED, IMMEDIATELY.  (Remember, hubs must receive the base in order for the site systems to receive it. Obviously, do not remove, ie 3717/0 from export, since 3717/3 needs to get it.)

Here is the list:


Region One:
1206/0 Phantasm,Seattle_WA,Satanic_Bunny_Masher,1-206-232-5912,9600,CM,XA,HS

Region Eight:
8416/2  The_Cathedral,Milton_ON,Arch_Bishop,1-416-875-2656,9600,CM,XA,HST,V42,



HERE IS A LIST OF SYSTEMS WHICH I >KNOW< SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THIS BASE:

4419/0  The_Realm_of_Death,Toledo_OH,Darkfalz,1-419-475-3089,9600,CM,XA,HST,V3
5509/0  Prowler's_DOMAIN,Spokane_WA,Night_Prowler,1-509-327-8922,9600,CM,XA,V
8416/5  The_Basement_Breweries,Hamilton_ON,Wizard,1-416-527-3469,9600,CM,XA,V


Anyway, that should do it.  If anyone else wants access to this base, they
will have to apply for it through myself, or Deicide and Phantom Account (CCi
H/P Moderators).
