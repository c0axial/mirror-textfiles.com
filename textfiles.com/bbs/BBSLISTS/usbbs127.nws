             CompConnx        6/2


     Computer Connections is back !  Bob's board will continue 
     to carry the USBBS list.

     Bob has long been a long-time friend and supporter of
     USBBS, first as the sole update point and then as a
     distribution point for the list.
     
----------------------------------------------------------------
             NEW BBS DESIGNATIONS

I have started changing some of the older BBS designations:

I = TriBBS

If you have additional suggestions, please let me know.

----------------------------------------------------------------
        USBBS AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET

USBBS is available over the Internet.  You can get the
entire list or request area codes or state selections to
customize a list.  The paragraphs below explain how.

The Whole List via USENET

It is posted to "alt.bbs.lists" at the same time it is
distributed to the update points.  The USBBS###.LST file is
posted in multiple pieces. The entire archive file is not
posted because of the difficulty some people have with
uuencoded files.

The archive is available via FTP from oak.oakland.edu.  It is
posted there shortly after the weekend distribution and will
be available sometime during the next week.  Request
/pub/msdos/bbslist/usbbs###.zip (where "###" is the edition
number).

Customized List

BOBsBBS now supports a "customized list server" which is
available via e-mail.  This server will prepare a customized
list for you of selected area codes and/or states.  Send an
e-mail request to:

bobsbbs!usbbs@sactoh0.sac.ca.us

In the body of the request, the server recognizes the
following commands:

AC <area code>

     You may include a maximum of 5 of these area code
     commands. example: AC 916
     
ST <2 character state abbreviation>

     You may request a maximum of 2 states.  Use the two
     character state abbreviation.  You may also enter FGN
     for foreign or UNK for unknown areas.  Canadian boards
     use the two character abbreviation for the province.
     example: ST CA
     
REPLY <your internet ID>

     Include this command to be sure that the server can
     return the mail to you.  The "from:" field in messages
     is often not accurate.
     example: REPLY bobsbbs!usbbs@sactoh0.sac.ca.us
     
HOW-TO

     Request the how-to get USBBS text file which
     accompanies the list.
     
NEWS

     Request the USBBS news file.
     
HELP

     Send current information on the mail server.
     
QUIT

     The list command in the message.
     
All other commands/lines in the message are ignored.

NOTE: This server collects mail about once per day.  Please
be patient.  In most cases your request will be returned to
you within 24-72 hours.  You can NOT request the entire list
through this mechanism, please do not ask.  This is a
service in testing and MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE AT ALL TIMES.

----------------------------------------------------------------
             USBBS DOWNLOADS AT BOBSBBS

BOBsBBS supports a set of special ID's which are for downloading
the USBBS list ONLY.  Here they are:

ID                  PROTOCOL
USBBS ZMODEM        Zmodem
USBBS YMODEM        Ymodem
USBBS XMODEM        Xmodem-Checksum
USBBS CRC           Xmodem-CRC
USBBS Xmodem1k      Xmodem-1K

These ID's have no passwords and go through a special script
which starts the download immediately after logon.  To help
you automate your downloads, here are the phrases to wait
for and the responses to enter:

WAIT FOR                      ENTER
Graphics                      <Enter>
LAST name                     {id};;
Protocol starts immediately   start protocol download
                              
Wait approximately 1 second after detecting each phrase.

Notice that there is a set of two semi-colons (";;") after
the {id}.  This by-passes the password prompt.  You MUST
enter this or you will get the "PASSWORD" prompt.  For
example, you would enter "USBBS ZMODEM;;" in response to the
"LAST name" prompt.

The connection is terminated immediately after the download
is completed.


----------------------------------------------------------------
             SOME THOUGHTS FOR THE FUTURE

The following are some thoughts about the USBBS National BBS
list.  It has been around for a long time in about the same
format.  But the BBSing and communications worlds are
changing rapidly and the list must keep up with those
changes.

As always your comments are appreciated.  Send them to
BOBsBBS 916-929-7511 or contact me on the internet at
"bobsbbs!system@sactoh0.SAC.CA.US"

Expiration of BBS's on USBBS

One of the major problems I have with the list is finding out when
boards go out of existence.  They do this quite often and without
notice.  I have been toying with the idea of expiring BBS entries if
they are more than ONE YEAR old.  What do you think?

The Annotated USBBS List

(I'm getting closer to producing this list.  The key is to
make sure that it can be produced without too much work on
my part!)

I get a number of requests for boards with a specific focus
or specific features. Sysops are asked to leave this
information when they update their board information on the
list.

Unfortunately, this information is not available on the
standard USBBS list.  Therefore, I propose an "annotated"
BBS list as an addition to the standard list.  This list
would be in the following format:

nnn-nnn-nnnn xx xxxxxxxxx . . . <-The standard USBBS list line
      FOCUS: ffffffffffff . . . <-The board's focus (60 chars)
             cccccccccccc . . . <-Comment (60 chars)
             cccccccccccc . . . <-Comment (60 chars)

The annotated list would be distributed in a separate
archive (USBANxxx) on the same schedule as the USBBS list.
"xxx" would reflect the same version number as the standard
list.

The following conditions would have to be met by the
updaters in order to remain on the annotated list:

ú Qualify for the standard USBBS list
  
ú Update information at least once every 90 days by
  calling BOBsBBS (916-929-7511).  This will assure that the
  information entered will be correct and compelte.
  
----------------------------------------------------------------
                   RELEASE SCHEDULE

This is a release schedule for USBBS for the next several
months.  Unless there is some reason to do so, the list
is released on the last weekend of the month unless the
first of the month is on a weekend.  All revisions for the
list should be in by the Wednesday before the release date
to help assure that I get them.

PLEASE NOTE:  Because I do this for free, I reserve the
right to change this schedule without notice.  Notices about
distribution are posted on BOBsBBS (916-929-7511).  Sorry
for any inconvenience this causes.

SYSOPS, please note:  I sometimes have difficulty reaching
the remote update points before the release date.  If the
board is down or constantly busy, I may not be able to
collect the information before the update for that month.
Call BOBsBBS (916-929-7511) to be assured that your update
will be considered for the next edition of the list.
