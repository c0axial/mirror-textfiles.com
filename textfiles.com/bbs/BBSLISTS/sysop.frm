 THIS LISTING IS ** ONLY ** FOR SYSTEMS WHICH OPERATE 24 HOURS DAILY!

 Part-time bbs's will not be listed. Entry in this list will subject
 your number to calls at any hour of the day and night, for several
 months/years to come.
 
 NO BBS INVOLVED IN KNOWN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES WILL BE LISTED.

 We reserve the right to refuse list inclusion to any board or sysop
 known to engage in the spread of illegal online activity of any kind.
 Inclusion in this bbs list is a priviledge, not a right.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  Please answer the following questions so we may correctly place
 your bbs in the DFW BBS LIST and PRINTED PUBLICATIONS. Some of
 your answers will be used for Demographic info by the sysop.
 and WILL NOT be used for any public display.


1. What is your real name, and what is today's date?

1. _____________________________________________________________________



2. Where did you hear of Second Sanctum? (For our stats only)

2. _____________________________________________________________________


 In accordance to the conventions found at the bottom of each D\FW list,
 the words "THE" and "BBS" will not be included as part of the name
 of any listed bbs. We KNOW you are a bbs, and it makes no real sense to
 have all boards in D/FW listed under letter "T" in an alphabetical list!


3. What is the name of your BBS?

3. _____________________________________________________________________


4. What BBS SOFTWARE does your board run with? (Version not important)

4. _____________________________________________________________________


 Most sysops are extraordinarily responsible for the way they conduct
 themselves online. We want to insure that if your system goes down or changes
 pertinent information, the list-keeper here will not be blamed for problems
 caused by your number being published in a circulated list. If your system
 goes down, your listed number will continue to receive latenight calls until
 you specifically ask/tell us to remove it from the published, circulated
 lists. Therefore, to insure you understand the burden of responsibility lies
 with you in the circulation of this phone number, please indicate your
 permission to be listed below:

5. Do you give your permission to be listed in the ORIGINAL DFW BBS LISTS?

5. _____________________________________________________________________


6. For statistical purposes only, what is your age & profession?

6. _____________________________________________________________________


7. What CITY does this board run out of?

8. What is the number to this fine system? (Multinodes, list all lines)

8. _____________________________________________________________________


 By "METRO" number, we mean - are you paying ADDITIONAL charges for
 a special line which can be called from BOTH 214 and 817 prefix, without
 long distance charges to the caller? You are NOT a metro line unless you
 pay those "metro line" charges to your local phone company. SO:


9. Do you pay the EXTRA fees to be a METRO number prefix? Which prefix?

9. _______________________________________________________________________


10. Is this number a CHANGED number for an existing bbs? List old & new # here:

10. _______________________________________________________________________


    Part time boards will not be listed in this bbs list. Since this list
    may linger on in circulation long after it is current, we need to know
    that you have enough committment to running an online service for us
    to go to the trouble of listing it/unlisting/renaming etc. If you do
    not have at least one dedicated modem line, or phone line that only
    the modem answers, you are not a 24 hour service, we will not list you.
    This is a courtesy to you and whoever gets your phone number after you,
    so there will be no hard feelings about midnight (and later) calls...

11. How long have you been online as a ** 24-hour ** service?

11. _______________________________________________________________________



12. List any network node numbers or I.D.'s for your system...

 Most boards these days offer quite a bit MORE than the "same old"
 expected collections of games, graffiti, doors, networks, pictures,
 files and messages. The best boards now have strong themes which
 make the bbs unique, interesting and useful to a particular group
 or special interest.


 You have 5 lines of text description in the BBS List to tell us
 what makes your board stand out from the others. If you need more
 room, add extra lines but please try to outline your specialties
 in a simple, brief summary.  Your own words placed here will
 be quoted so write EXACTLY the description you want printed.

23. Will you please remember to notify us here if your board goes DOWN?

24.Will you please remember to notify us here if your bbs info CHANGES?

 Mark Robbins will edit in your info to the lists during the next edit!

 PLEASE DO NOT re-add the same info here for three (3) months,
 unless your bbs information CHANGES during that time. THANKS!

 You are hereby invited and encouraged to use the DFW BBS LISTS, both
 the short list and full "extended text" editions, as BULLETINS and as
 FILE TRANSFERS on your own online system, if you will use the most
 current edition to display and circulate from your system!

25. Would you be interested in carrying BBS LIST updates on your board?

25. _____________________________________________________________________

  As of 6/15/95, we will no longer send out the BBS LISTS via FIDO TIC
 distribution. The reason for this is simple: many sysops will not report
 down systems and as a result, new BBS's are allocated old FIDO node #s.
 The newest DFW BBS LIST is then sent to the new bbs "uninvited" and for
 whatever reason, some people get angry beyond reason when they receive
 the file. (Don't ask why, it is free and they can simply delete it if
 they don't want it). In any case, we are now asking that you FREQ the
 most current bbs list from 1:130/609 using magic filename "DFW" and
 there is no need for a session password to get the list. We also serve
 as a distribution point for the US BBS LIST and you may FREQ the new
 updates by using magic word "USBBS".  Send your FREQ requests to us
 any time, 24 hour hours any day.

  Please carry the bbs lists on your board for your users! We appreciate
 your use of the lists online as both BULLETINS and FILE TRANSFERS. The
 MOST CURRENT BBS LIST is always freely available as a file download
 from the distribution source: PCBoard Second Sanctum 817-467-1175.
