As I expected, someone would have something to say...

Well, this should make you happy.  This is the list I originally intended to
post.  All 9600 baud boards.  And for the skeptical, the number of months the
board has been on the list is also there.  I am on most of these, so don't
worry that they are dead.  Sheesh!

|      Software which is a modified version of one of the above categories is |
|   not considered a new program in it's own right, but is placed under the   |
|   category of the program which spawned it.  This is because I do not have  |
|   the room to list the dozens of "Tree-Tac", "Digi-Pro", "Pro-Link" and     |
|   all the other names sysops tend to come up with for their modified        |
|   systems.                                                                  |

|      Those boards marked with an asterisk (*) are those I would personally  |
|   recommend.  They are among the best on the List.  This is not to say,     |
|   however, that some of the unmarked ones are not excellent systems.  This  |
|   is simply my personal recommendation.                                     |
|                                                                             |
|      Some systems, at the behest of their sysops, do not have complete      |
|   phone number listings.  The reason is that these are private systems      |
|   which accept new users by invitation only.  I have not listed systems     |
|   which I could not get access on due to the fact that I cannot collect     |
|   information on them.  The Electric Apple is the case I refer to here, as  |
|   it accepts no new users at the moment.                                    |

|   Please:                                                                   |
|          If you are the sysop of, or a user of, a BBS running on an HST and |
|   oriented towards the Apple // or Apple IIGS, please let me know.  If there|
|   are any changes and/or updates for List information, please let me know.  |
|   It has become very difficult for me to verify each one of these 65+ BBS'  |
|   every month, much less keep up with the rise of new ones.                 |
|                                                                             |
|          I would like to thank all of those sysops who have displayed this  |
|   list in their BBS system, and who have made it the most widely-used Apple |
|   BBS list these days.  Other sysops are welcome to incorporate the list in |
|   their systems as well, so long as it's contents remain unaltered.         |
