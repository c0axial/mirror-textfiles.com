 While I used to actuall y call and verify each and every bbs number in
 the State of Texas, this ran my phone bill into the thousands each month,
 and it became harder and harder to keep up with who was down/moved/new.

 This listing is a realistic approach to get current phone numbers into
 the hands of modem owners, both now and in the future. While longer
 lists have been distributed and published, none have been truly current
 by the time most interested modem owners get to one. As a result, most
 such published lists remain completely useless, and full of disconnected
 numbers. Such misinformation could even be considered harrassment by
 the individuals who answer the phone during the early A.M., not knowing
 their number used to be a modem service.

 The simple remedy to this problem rests below. Every name and number
 in this listing refers to the person who KEEPS BBS LISTS for a given
 area or city in Texas. You may contact this person for the most updated
 listing to be offered for the area.

 Each system below is described verbatim in a statement by its Sysop
 (System Operator). All credit to listings should go to each listkeeper
 who takes time to research and edit for the benefit of others.

The Rag Enterprises BBS was founded in the spirit of the modem user. After
calling BBS's myself for years, I was frustrated with unfriendly SysOps and
BBS's that were hard to navigate. So I decided to start my own BBS based on
ease of use and friendliness. The Rag Enterprises BBS focuses on Windows and
OS/2 support while maintaining a BBS that everyone can use. From over twenty
online games to 250 megs of files, RagBBS has something for everyone, and if
you don't see what you are looking for, we will get it for you.

CTSA Unlimited BBS                               FIDO 1:382/86

Software: Binkley/Maximus

CTSA Unlimited BBS was started in 1985 as the flagship bbs for Central Texas
Sysop Association (CTSA). CTSA was formed as a non-profit organization with
a constitution and by-laws spelling out the purpose of clean legal
communications with Sysops and Users. We wanted to meet at least once a
month to meet the people we were in CHAT with on a regualr basis. One of our
first projects was to organize a monthly BBS LIST so our users could get
current phone numbers updated every month. We adopted the format
CTSAMMYY.BBS (ie. CTSA0393.BBS). As FIDONET developed we formed a local mail
conference for the Austin area (BBSINFO) that has become very active and
furnishes us with super input on new boards and recent changes. Through the
years we have had many list managers who put in many hours to the BBS LIST.
Ree Rubel of City Limits bbs currently maintains our list and as a group we
occaisionally make a mass effort to verify the data is correct. Our members
have written a bbs list converter (ABL2DIAL.ZIP) that takes our monthly list
and converts it to several comm program dialing directories. Our first bbs
machine was personally donated by Michael Dell of Dell Computers!

PCBoard Second Sanctum has hosted the original, oldest continuous bbs lists
for the D/FW area, as well as the State of Texas, since the early 80's. This
service will continue as long as it is needed by Texas Modem Users. Often
imitiated, never equalled. Primary concern of the lists are keeping as
absolutely updated as possible, and focusing on legitimate and commercial
bulletin boards (rather than those promoting questionable activities).

Second Sanctum caters to Medical/Legal/Business/Technical PROFESSIONALS,
FAMILY-Interest, Religious interests, underground topics, Private adult fun,
and more. We are more interested in exchanging information than acting as a
file base; our files are meant to support the conferences. No games period.
One month free trial to check our services, messages and files. We ARE
"The BBS for those who have outgrown the ordinary".

Second Sanctum Communications has been setting up professional BBS services
and systems to the most prominent names of business in North Texas. Let us
show you how an online service can increase YOUR productivity.

D/FW BBS LIST is converted to all communications programs dialing
directories via Henry Clark's FONDIR program. Further information available
