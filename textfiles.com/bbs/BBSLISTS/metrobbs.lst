               METRO List - Official Area Code 617 BBS List
               
               Issue #1                         June 1995

                          Compiled by Paul Litvak

Welcome to the first issue of the METRO List!
I have noticed that the 617 Boston area is lacking an updated BBS List and
decided to start a list that will be updated each month. I am going to get 
this list into Boardwatch Magazine's List of BBS List Keepers as THE bbs
list for the 617 area code. 
I do not think that I have all the systems in the area on this list.
If you know of a board that is not listed here, please contact me and give
me its number. I will check its existence and include it in the next issue of
the list.
I will eventually have the current issue of the list on every bbs listed in 
here but for now anyone who wants me to deliver an updated issue monthly 
to his/her bbs will have to pay an annual fee of $12(if their bbs is in  
617 AC), $20(if their bbs is in some other AC in the US), or $30(if their 
bbs is outside US).
Of course you can always download the current issue of this list free of
charge on the PAL Online BBS, which is the central distribution site of the 
METRO List. The list is in the file METRLIST.ZIP
I am currently using Telix to keep this list updated but Telix does not
allow long descriptions for each entry, so if you know of a good comm. 
program that would let me enter long descriptions please contact me. 
Also ignore *70 in front of the telephone numbers, I used this to disable 
call waiting.
The list will give BBS of the Month award to the most outstanding bbs each 
month. If you would like to nominate a bbs for the award, contact me.

To purchase an advertisement in this list for $5 a month, contact me.

You can distribute this list in an unmodified form free of charge. You can 
not modify this list. You can not charge money for this list. You can not  
distribute this list under you name, your company's name, your dog's name, 
etc. The METRO List is to be used only as reference material.

If you have any suggestions or comments, please contact me.

Note: Some of the boards above do not have dates next to them. I am 
      sure these BBSs exist but everytime I called to verify them they were
      BUSY.
