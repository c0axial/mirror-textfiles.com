        The QuickFix System
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The QuickFix System offers software authors an effective and
        economical method to create compact upgrade patches (fix files).
        This is a FULLY FUNCTIONAL DEMONSTRATION release of the QuickFix
        System, allowing you to evaluate it's performance fully. The
        archive name is QFIX101.ZIP.

        Often after releasing a software package, small changes due to
        bug fixes or additional features make it necessary for the
        author to re-release the entire package again. Using the
        QuickFix System, authors can create compact fix files that
        upgrade the end users' file(s) to their updated version(s),
        requiring distribution of only this smaller fix file. The
        QuickFix System can update a single file or several files from
        within a single fix file, and even has the capability to upgrade
        from any one of a series of versions to the latest version.

        The QuickFix System includes the MakeFix utility that creates
        the fix files; the QuickFix applicator program to be distributed
        with the fix files that applies the update patches; and the
        FixMenu graphic menu interface for a simple 'point-n-shoot'
        environment when creating fix files.
