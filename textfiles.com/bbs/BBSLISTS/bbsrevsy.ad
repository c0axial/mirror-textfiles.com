I originally created The BBS Review after moving to Walnut Creek and 
spending too much time tracking down BBSes that specialized in things that 
I was interested in. There are a lot of BBS lists out there, but most of 
them just give you names and phone numbers. The BBS Review also gives a 
description of each BBS so that you can quickly find a BBS that caters to 
whatever your interest is. The main features of the BBS Review are:

* It allows people to describe their favorite BBS in detail, which allows
  readers to quickly locate BBSes that they wish to call.
* The Review is sorted by area code first, and then alphabetically by BBS 
  name within each area code. This makes it possible for readers to 
  quickly find BBSes that are local calls.
* It is available in both ANSI and ASCII formats, so it makes a great 
  color bulletin file.
* It automatically deletes BBS listings that are over six months old, so 
  readers don't end up wasting time calling defunct BBSes. This also 
  insures that BBSes which change over time get fresh reviews periodically.
* It is implemented as a *distributed* questionnaire, so that people can 
  answer the Review's questions on many different BBS systems and all of 
  the reviews from all of the different systems can be compiled into one 
  report.
* BBS entries are keyed by phone number. You can change ANY review at ANY
  time by simply answering the questionnaire again using the same phone 
  number. 

If you are interested in carrying the BBS Review on your system then send
a file-request asking for BBSREV (The Review) and BBSREVSY (BBS Review 
Sysop Pack) to &TOTSE, 1:161/211.
