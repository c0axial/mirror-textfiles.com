        --==[[ Expiration of BBS's on USBBS [[==--

One of the major problems I have with the list is finding out when
boards go out of existence.  They do this quite often and without
notice.

It's coming!  I will phase in expiration of BBS listings during
1995.  I will "grandfather" existing boards and will probably give
the current list one year rather than 3-6 months.  I'm still working
out the details, but, things will probably start sometime around June
1995.

Check out "The A-List" article below for another reason to update
your BBS every three months.

Your comments are always welcome.

                        --==[[ The A-List ]]==--

BBS Magazine now prints an annotated list of BBS systems derived
from updates to the USBBS list for the last three months. Updates
made to BOBsBBS (916-929-7511) or created by USBBSUP.EXE are the
only updates considered.

The "A-List" contains all the information from the USBBS list
*plus* the FOCUS and COMMENT lines entered by the updaters.  This
makes it a very valuable list for callers searching for a board
with a particular focus.

BBS Magazine is published monthly and is available wherever
magazines are sold, or by calling 800-822-0437. Email

  The USBBS List is distributed over FIDO FILEBONE name
  DFWTXLST for all TIC file users in FIDO-style networks.

  --==[[  COMMERCIAL/SHAREWARE PRODUCTS SUPPORTING USBBS  ]]==--

If you have a commercial or shareware product which supports the
USBBS List, I'd like to list it here.  Please send me a (registered)
copy of your product to I can check it out.  I will list it here
so the thousands of BBSer's who use the USBBS List can know that
you support the list.

Upload shareware to BOBsBBS (916-929-7511) and I will post it
on the board.  Or send a copy of your commercial software to:

Bob Breedlove

                   Comments to the editor.

BOBsBBS (916-929-7511) is still the best way for updates or to
reach the USBBS.

              --==[[  LIST KEEPERS TAKE NOTE  ]]==--

Many of the local list keepers verify BBS's continued existence.
Something that I feel is one of the shortcomings of any list.

The proposal is to create an easy way for listkeepers to reformat
their lists for submission to the USBBS national BBS list each
month.  This has the advantage of gaining national exposure for
the boards on the list and gives our national readers exposure
to more BBS systems.

The boards on the list will have to meet the minimum requirements
for posting to USBBS.  Thus, the listkeeper would have to collect
the basic information, at a minimum.  This information includes:

    - Phone number including area code
	- City, State
    - Sysop's REAL Name
    - BBS Software
    - Modem Speed and type
    - BBS Name
    - Disk Space devoted to the BBS
    - Number of nodes (phone lines)

I will provide, as my part of the process, a free formatting
program which will format from a text version of the local list
to the submission format for USBBS.  The edition field on the USBBS
list will contain an indication of the source list from which
the information was taken.  A list of listkeepers is
provided along with the other information in the USBBSxxx.ZIP.

As you can see from edition 129+, I have made arrangements with
the first of the local listkeepers.  This listkeeper decided to
format the entries since he already had the software to do so.

Contact me at BOBsBBS or bob@bobsware.com for more information.

            --==[[  USBBS DOWNLOADS AT BOBSBBS  ]]==--

BOBsBBS supports a set of special ID's which are for downloading
the USBBS list ONLY.  Here they are:

ID                  PROTOCOL
USBBS ZMODEM        Zmodem
USBBS YMODEM        Ymodem
USBBS XMODEM        Xmodem-Checksum
USBBS CRC           Xmodem-CRC
USBBS Xmodem1k      Xmodem-1K

These ID's have no passwords and go through a special script
which starts the download immediately after logon.  To help
you automate your downloads, here are the phrases to wait
for and the responses to enter:

WAIT FOR                      ENTER
Graphics                      <Enter>
LAST name                     {id};;
Protocol starts immediately   start protocol download

Wait approximately 1 second after detecting each phrase.

Notice that there is a set of two semi-colons (";;") after
the {id}.  This by-passes the password prompt.  You MUST
enter this or you will get the "PASSWORD" prompt.  For
example, you would enter "USBBS ZMODEM;;" in response to the
"LAST name" prompt.

The connection is terminated immediately after the download
is completed.


                  --==[[  RELEASE SCHEDULE ]==--

This is a release schedule for USBBS for the next several
months.  The list is released on the last weekend of the
month, unless there is some reason to revise this schedule.
Here are a couple of known exceptions:

- If the first of the next month is on a weekend, the list
  is released on that weekend.
- If the last weekend of the month is a holiday weekend, the
  list distribution will be adjusted.
- If I will be out of town or otherwise occupied on the release
  weekend, the list distribution will be adjusted.

The list is usually available sometime on Sunday afternoon of the
release weekend.  If you want to avoid long distance calls, I'd
suggest that you call Sunday after 6p, Pacific Time.  Of course,
since this is my hobby, there are no guarantees.

All revisions for the list should be in by the Monday before
the release date to help assure that I get them and add them
to the list.  Although some parts of this effort are automated,
much is manual.  I cannot guarantee that I will be able to get
revisions received after Monday into the next list edition.

PLEASE NOTE:  Because I do this for free, I reserve the
right to change this schedule without notice.  Notices about
distribution are posted on BOBsBBS (916-929-7511).  Sorry
for any inconvenience this causes.

SYSOPS, please note:  I sometimes have difficulty reaching
the remote update points before the release date.  If the
board is down or constantly busy, I may not be able to
collect the information before the update for that month.
Call BOBsBBS (916-929-7511) to be assured that your update
will be considered for the next edition of the list.
