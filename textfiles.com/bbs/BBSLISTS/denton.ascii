 Key to Abbreviations

 INET - Internet Access
  NET - Networked BBS (Fidonet, etc.)
  MSG - Local Message Conferences Only
 FILE - File Transfers
  GAM - Online Games
  TBA - To Be Announced

 Systems that offer local, non-networked message conferences are flagged MSG.
 BBSs that are also "networked" with other BBSs are flagged NET.  BBSs that
 offer Internet access in addition to either local message conferences or
 networked BBS services, or both, are flagged INET.  Check the extended
 description for each BBS for detail on scope and services provided.

 Unless otherwise noted, all systems are available 24 hours daily, 7 days a
 week.  All numbers are local to the Denton, Texas, calling area.  Numbers
 with prefixes of 240, 241, 243, 320, 242, 321, 458 and 648 may also be local
 to an extended area including Argyle, Bartonville, Carrollton, Denton, DFW
 Airport, Garland, Grapevine, Irving, Justin, Keller, Lake Dallas, Lewisville,
 Plano, Ponder, Rowlett, Sanger and Wylie.  Unless otherwise noted, all sys-
 tems are "dial up" accessible by modem.  The SBI list described below is a
 comprehensive guide to BBSs and online services that are accessible only
 through an Internet Service Provider.

 This list is also available by File Request (FREQ) from Fido 1:393/11 as
 DT_BBLST.TXT, DENTON.TXT or DENTON anytime except during Zone Mail Hour, or
 by download under the same filenames.  An archive file, DENTON.ZIP, is also
 available.  It contains additional items including a list of discontinued
 local bulletin boards.  The distributed version of the file has the release
 date embedded in the filename for easy identification: dtYYMMDD.txt and
 dtYYMMDD.zip.  This list may be freely distributed as long as it is not
 altered in any way and no fees are charged.  The list may also be downloaded
 from our web page at http://www.chatter.com/~wb/ anytime.

 Other lists available by File Request or download include BIGD.ZIP (DFW area),
 USBBS185.ZIP, and SBI0497.ZIP (a list of Telnet accessible BBSs).  All are
 also viewable in the "GFile" area on The Mezzanine by hitting G at the main
 menu prompt, then selecting one of the following folders:

                           * BIGD Folder
                           * USBBS Folder
                           * Telnet Accessible BBSs

 Although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of these BBS listings,
 no guarantees are expressed or implied. Information of this type is a
 moving target and subject to change at anytime. Listings were current as of
 the dates shown for each system. The extended descriptive information, when
 present, is provided by the respective system operators and is included in
 the list as a courtesy.  Updates are released as changes occur.  As the few
 remaining dialup BBSs in Denton have been very stable for the last several 
 years, these listings are verified only occasionally these days.

 Updates and corrections to the Denton Area BBS List are invited and should
 be netmailed to Walter Bowen, Fido 1:393/11 or E-mailed to wbowen@unt.edu
 or wb@chatter.com on the Internet or in Denton to Walter Bowen on The
 Mezzanine BBS (565-9165). Thanks, as always, for your help in keeping this
 information current!
