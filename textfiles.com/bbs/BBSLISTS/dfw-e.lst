 Note: Every system in this listing of online services was placed here by
       the Sysop listed for that system.  The responsibility for changed
       or disconnected numbers lies with the names associated with numbers.
       Unlike other lists that use automated doors to enter and verify bbs
       numbers, we too have used such programs and found them to allow
       non-bbs numbers to be added to the list. They also remove a working
       bbs from the list if the auto-verifier happens to call when your bbs
       is down for system maintenence or other reasons. At DFW.ZIP we have
       used such an automated feature in years past, now we find that we
       retain more accuracy by personally checking list entries for bogus
       numbers and down systems.  Don't be fooled by overhyped bbs doors
       which produce inaccuracies in the bbs list they generate.
  ------------------------ BUM STEER AWARDS -------------------------------
                             April 1996

  Number One to Stan Abercrombie - aka "The Bandit".  This person is well-known
  to menace people "voice" PARTICULARLY females, whom he will harrass at all
  hours once he weasles a phone number from them.  He has been repeatedly
  reported to phone companies time and time again, but always seems to
  reappear with or without running his own BBS.  A genuine problem-causer to
  BBS Land since the mid-80's; anyone who has come into contact with him
  will have personal horror stories.  Avoid him.

  Number Two to Texas Metronet - the Internet provider.  Do not own a
  computer to run their husband/wife business from; they leech off of the
  local University mainframe (like the FREE lonestar.org) but THEY CHARGE
  people for it. Act like customer service is a god given favor which they
  should be paid extra for. Wife/Accounting department keeps track of
  customer service questions as if she should charge customers for each.
  Technical support is nominally okay until accounting hears about it.

  Number Three to local FIDO politics.  In D/FW it seems customary to have
  a mandatory change of hub sites every couple of months.  This does not
  include the regular "elections" where the same group of cheerleaders take
  turns electing each other local beauty queen. A very good network with
  an abundance of local "characters"

  Number Four goes to the ba-jillions of folks who believe all the hype
  that they are going to be able to make instant millions running a business on
  the Internet, even though they have never dialed a modem or contacted a
  single BBS in their life.  After time and effort these Hungry Hippos find out
  they have a very expensive paperweight on their desks and that most 12 year
  old sysops run a better online service than the "business" folks could ever
  pull off, Internet or no.

  Number Five goes to Incredible Universe and CompUSA.  Both treat you with
  swarming staff (3-5 tee-shirted employeees per customer) who will ALWAYS
  tell you ANYTHING to make a sale. Examples: "Of COURSE hard drive space and
  RAM memory are the same thing. Especially under Windows!" or "Yes sir this
  2400 modem is just as good as the expensive ones!" or "Just go home and plug
  in this modem and you are on the Internet!" or "Yes, your SVGA monitor NEEDS
  this whole wall of Screen Savers". Ask them to show you ANY VGA monitor that
  has had an image burned into the screen from not using screen savers.

  Many other bbs's and tabloids (who rename and move frequently for some
  reason) tend to "borrow" the contents of this bbs list for publication
  under different names.  While imitation is the highest form of flattery,
  SECOND SANCTUM's bbs list has remained the most accurate, and most used
  bbs list in Texas for two simple reasons:

  1)  This is the oldest continuous bbs list in the state of Texas and
      has been consistently updated with regularity since 1982. It is
      completely "BY all D/FW Sysops, FOR all D/FW Sysops" who personally
      contribute all the information found in the list.

  2)  It has always been, and always will be  -- 100% FREE -- and easily
      distributed.  The copycats want you to PAY for your submission of
      info about your bbs. DFW.ZIP has and always will provide unlimited
      space FOR FREE to provide each sysop space to describe the online
      services offered at a given system.  WHY PAY to be included in a
      list or publication which still carries numbers which were disconnected
      in 1990? DFW.ZIP gives you the BEST for FREE.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------


   Please see the "short form" of this list (DFW.LST) for complete
  info on being included in these ORIGINAL DFW BBS LISTS. In order to
  get your bbs on this list, please fill out the SYSOP SURVEY found
  in every DFW.ZIP file as SYSOP.FRM. Rename this to "yourname".FRM when
  completed, and netmail to FIDO 1:130/607 or mark.robbins@ssanctum.com
