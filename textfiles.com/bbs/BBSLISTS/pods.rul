            PAGAN/OCCULT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM (P.O.D.S) INFORMATION
                               (Updated 5/11/92)

         The  PODS  is  an informal association of  Pagan  Sysops  and 
         Sysops   carrying   Pagan/Magickal/Occult   oriented   echoes 
         operating  on  an  international basis, with  FIDO  Nodes  in 
         Australia, Canada, Germany, the U.K., and across the USA.

         The  PODS system is also available via Zone 93 and  a  weekly 
         nodelist  is available.  Chuck Haynes of 308/60 is in  charge 
         of  the  93:9xxx/xxx  nodelist  and  assignment  of  net/node 
         numbers.

         The objective of this group is to serve as a "Pagan Backbone" 
         for  low  noise  distribution of this  specialized  group  of 
         echoes.   Administration of this distribution system is  done 
         via the PAGANSYS echo which is primarily restricted to SYSOPs 
         and  this  echo is mandatory for all who would be a  part  of 
         this distribution system. PAGANSYS is not mandatory for those 
         who  will  not  be  hubbing  to  other  BBS's,  however   all 
         administration  of the P.O.D.S. will be done in PAGANSYS,  so 
         if a sysop wants a voice, he or she will need to participate. 

         With few exceptions,NONE of the PODS echoes will be placed on 
         the  regular  FIDONET BACKBONE!  And  within  the  exceptions 
         (echoes already on the backbone ) the backbone echoes are not 
         to be considered as mandatory for the hubs.

         Also, any echo originating on another network will NOT become 
         a "core" echo and be required for the major hubs.

         There  has  been  some question as to the  authority  of  the 
         Moderators  in  the Echo areas carried  by  the  Pagan/Occult 
         Distribution  System.   The Current Moderator of  record  for 
         each   echo   has  absolute  authority   over   content   and 
         distribution  of  the echo they  moderate.   The  moderator's 
         decisions  in these matters will be totally enforced  by  the 
         coordinator.  
              If a moderator decides that an individual is to be  "cut 
         off"  from access to an echo, then it will be  done,  through 
         whatever means necessary to enforce that moderator's decision 
         including the suspension of feeds.

         9pm daily, or netmail at 1:308/60 24 Hrs.
