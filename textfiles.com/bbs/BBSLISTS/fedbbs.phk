
                        Electronic Bulletin Boards

If you need quick information on microcomputers, highway construction, or
even national weather trends, electronic bulletin boards may have the
answers. Electronic bulletin boards can offer you low-cost, online access
to unique information and resources not normally available through
commercial database vendors.  And what is more important, the information
on electronic bulletin boards is often updated daily, providing you with
the newest information not yet available in larger, conventional databases. 
Another advantage to electronic bulletin boards is their relative easy
access.  Where accessing conventional online databases may require special
knowledge of computer languages, bulletin boards are frequently driven by
simple, user-friendly menus.

One of the nicer features of these bulletin boards which most online
databases lack is that they often allow dialogue to take place between the
user and the system operator (sysop), and even between different users. 
The Air Force's Small Computer Technical Center, for example, allows you to
leave a message on the bulletin board outlining, say, a computer software
problem you are having, and if the system operator or one of the other
users can help, they can leave you a message, sometimes on the same day. 
While some bulletin boards require a subscription fee, many do not, which
means you pay only for any long distance telephone charges.

Listed below are a sampling of the principal bulletin boards available. 
Additional online systems are identified in the preceding section on
federal government databases.
