Graphical Listing Indicating Trinity and Cleveland's Housed Electronic Systems

     GLITCHES is produced BI-WEEKLY.  It is not your average bbs list!
In it, there is news, sysop interviews, etc.  Sorry, but we cannot be        
responsible for any typo's etc.  If you want your bbs added to the list,
feel free to leave a message on Medieval Realms(216-356-2341). 

JUST REMEMBER>>>>> WHEN THE QUESTION,
"Where did you hear about this BBS from?"
COMES UP, JUST SAY "GLITCHES!"

For about every two weeks, I intend to keep up with my own BBS listing. Almost 
all BBS's will be in the local Cleveland area, though I would check with your 
own telephone book(in the front) as to whether a BBS is local or not. In 
addition, for added convenience(and since I fall in this category), if your 
phone number starts with 734, 777, 779, 835, 871, 892, 899, 962, or 979, these 
BBS's are GUARANTEED to be local. If they are not local, there will be @ 
placed by the name of the BBS in order to show that the number is a long 
distance call. To make this list readily available, I will be uploading it 
*bi-weekly* to the following BBS's in the area:

the Spectrum                  871-8203
Tower of Wayreth              524-5023
North East Ohio PC User Group 835-5763  
Medieval Realms               356-2341  
Proving Grounds BBS, The      235-9900  
Beyond Infinity               225-3516  
Star Base (1) Micro Systems   441-2168

You can contact me on those BBS's by writing E-mail to Martini. This will be
very helpful for sysops who have just started a BBS and need their number to 
be recognized. If you have a new BBS that you would like to be recognized, 
please leave mail to me and I will add it to my list. 

Please make this list popular and upload it everywhere so that everybody can 
have a decent BBS list. I am on most of these BBS's as Martini. E-mail me 
about YOUR BBS. In addition, if you want and extra good word or so about your 
BBS, don't be afraid to ask. This list will only become more developed through 
help from others. I will add whatever I can to the list. Enjoy!

WARNING: We assume no responsibilites of use with these files. USE AT YOUR OWN 
RISK!

Another thing... if you can't keep your number private, that's why it's on
this BBS list.  If for an EXTREME reason, you need to have your number
removed, please speak to either Martini, or Centepeede.
