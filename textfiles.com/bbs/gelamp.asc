Notes From The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""
By John Peters
   [GENIELAMP]
                                                                              


FROM MY DISKTOP   When chatting online or when leaving messages to other
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
"""""""""""""""   RoundTable members, sometimes probl
ems, misunder-
standings or downright angry confrontations are created simply because the
other person doesn't understand what you're _really_ trying to say.  If
you're not careful in how you convey your thoughts via the keyboard, what
you meant as a joke or wrote in jest, can sometimes be taken the wrong way
or blown entirely out of context.

     The problem is it's not _what_ you say that creates this situation,
but it is _how_ you say it.  For instance, a sentence said with a smile can
take on a whole new meaning than if it was said with a frown or angry look.
Facial movements and voice inflections are difficult to interject into your
writing, especially when you're writing on the fly as in an informal
RoundTable Conference or when writing a message or reply online.  Since the
reader can't see your face or body-language, he or she may not know that
you're making a joke or that you are teasing.

     There is a solution.  Over the years a "modem-language" has developed
to help take care of this predicament.  By interjecting a smiley face, " :)
" within your message or a descriptive word in brackets, such as [grin] or
[laugh], you can tell the other person, "Hey, don't take this seriously,
I'm just having fun."  A well placed [grin] can go a long way to help stop
a misunderstanding.

     Another reason this modem-language developed is to help minimize the
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
amount of typing it takes to convey a message to some
one else while online.
For example, it is much quicker to type, "BTW" then to type, "By The Way"
or "IMHO" instead of "In My Humble Opinion."

     Confusing?  Not really.  As you become more familiar with the lingo,
the strange characters and funny faces will be easier to figure out.  If
you do come across an unusual cluster of letters and you don't understand
what they mean, by all means ask the person who sent them.  To help you get
started, here's a partial list of some of the more popular modem-phrases
being used today on GEnie.  (Note: The following has been collected from
online posts, unofficial dictionaries and other sources.)
 
     Until next month...

Cannon Bubblejet Info   The Canon Bubblejets added Epson compatibility
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
"""""""""""""""""""""   shortly after their initial p
roduction run. I
believe all current models support Epson.

     Some programs, like PageStream, fully support the Bubblejet's native
mode with an appropriate driver. I myself uploaded a driver for First Word
Plus that accurately registers all printable characters in the ASCII window
that 1stWord users are accustomed to seeing on boot-up. The driver was
written by an ST guru, Barry Ober.

     In addition, aside from their inherent mode, Bubblejets also have IBM
Proprinter emulation, so this driver will also work.

     I own
 both an HP 500C and an _old_ pre-Epson compatible Bubblejet
BJ-10e portable. (I also have 300 and 400 dpi PostScript laser printers,
and regularly output to imagesetters at up to 3,000 dpi).

To wit:

     The 500C always edges the Bubblejet in 
throughput, though the
Bubblejet always edges the 500C in quality (black ink). That's the
_portable_ BJ beats the _desk model_ 500C. I can't vouch for the desk model
BJ's excepting for seeing one printing straight text off an IBM - it was
_VERY FAST_.

Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
     Using the available and preferable Strathmore Le
gacy Pen Plotter
Paper, Product No. 01-075 in the Bubblejet can deliver output from a
program like PageStream that will actually fool a knowledgeable observer
into thinking the BJ is a 300+ dpi laser. This will _never_ happen, using
_any_ paper, on the Deskjet, as far as my experience with some half dozen
HP's has proved, printing in all sorts of conditions from low to high
humidity, temperatures, etc., from coast to coast in the U.S.

     The BJ-10e also has a straight-through page option, allowing oddball
papers, like cut up grocery bags, to be used.

     On the HP side, try the Laseredge line from Schoeller papers.
Especially in color mode you will find a striking improvement in print
quality. I have worked with the inventor of these papers (the secret is in
the coatings), and can hands-down say that Laseredge brings the HP up to a
very satisfying quality level, but, still, not quite up to Canon black-ink
quality.

     You have to remember that the Deskjet prints at 300 dpi, or at about
70 percent of the Bubblejet's 360 dpi resolution. Therein lies the quality
difference. For either printer, to obtain maximum quality, you need to find
papers that do not bleed the ink through soak-in or capillary action. Each
machine has vastly different ink formulations: HP even changes formulation
between its color and black inks (papers good for color on the HP500C,
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
including HP's own brand, are not necessarily OK for 
HP black ink
printing).

     The Legacy Pen Plotter Paper has a caveat: the ink does not soak in _
AT ALL _, rather, it lies 'in a hi-res puddle' on the surface of the paper.
Handling the paper at the bottom of a just-printed page can cause smearing.
Drying time (about 15-30 seconds) must be allowed for prior to handling.
Though it may seem a hassle, you immediately get used to it because the
quality is a couple orders of magnitude better than your best expectations
for an-ink spraying printer.

     Bubblejets are also compatible with Macintosh computers through
products like the "Grappler", which provides the software and hardware
necessary for regular printing. My BJ is now on loan to a Mac user - I've
seen the results and they look very good.

Clipboard Standard Support   The Let 'Em Fly form_do() replacement
""""""""""""""""""""""""""   available in the library has clipboard support
for editable fields. Nice.

     If this question isn't appropriate here, let me know, but I've
wondered about the statement that Atari hadn't settled on a clipboard
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
standard until recently.

     As I understand the clipboard functions, there is a place built into
the AES that stores a path. You can read and change this path with two
functions provided by the AES. This has been available since version 1.0
and has worked the same way all along. Am I correct so far?

     So what was the problem? It seemed pretty obvious to me that if an
application needed to store something in the clipboard, it checks the AES
function that tells it the clipboard path. If there isn't one available, it
makes one, then stores what it made using the other AES function. From then
on, any other application (in the same session) knows where to read and
write clipboard files. Why did Atari have to come out and say that? It
seemed obvious to me.

     I'll grant, Atari probably should have included the function of the
SDS Clipboard CPX in the General Setup CPX, but what the heck. I just don't
see why developers ignored the availability of the two AES functions that
were intended for clipboard support. If an application uses those functions
as they are documented, it's handling the clipboard according to the
"standard."       (EXPLORER.5, CAT17, TOP9, MSG:47/M475)

 
Parlez Vouz Falconaise?   Gregg, language on the Falcon is not an issue.  
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
"""""""""""""""""""""""   Several languages are built
 into ROM.  You run a
little installation program which identifies the language you want to see
in your operating system instructions, andvoila! you have it!  The computer
figures out what voltage is coming at it and automatically adjusts; the
only concern would be whether your power cord will fit the outlet in a
foreign country, and extra power cords are easy enough to come by.  As for
the video, VGA shouldn't be a problem... but tv could be.  My Falcon was
designed for use with a German tv, and it has a PAL chip.  Now, I don't
understand the reasons behind all this, but I have heard of another
stateside dev simply changing some crystal in the same kind of unit and he
was able then to use US tvs.

     As a linguist who has reason from time to time to run in languages
other than English, I really appreciate the Falcon's approach to language.

Computer Insurance   I've heard that homeowners insurance will cover power

Alternate ST Monitors   If you get a computer shopper and look in the
"""""""""""""""""""""   "USA*Flex" ad (in the very back), they have a
section on "Brand name monitors". This lists specs on most of the popular
monitors today. Look for a Maximum horizontal scanning frequency of AT
LEAST 48kHz, since that is what the ISAC and AlberTT output. And as Jim
mentioned earlier, it must be a NON-INTERLACED monitor.

     While the NEC 3D WILL work with an unimproved ST (you need a
switchbox), it will NOT work with the ISAC or AlberTT cards because it only
has a maximum horizontal scanning frequency of 38kHz. Once you get up into
the higher priced NEC stuff, such as the 4D, 5D, 3FGx, 4FG, 5FG, or 6FG,
they all work with Jay's cards.

     One nice thing I've heard (can't guarantee it's true) about the NEC
monitors is that they come with a DB15 to DB9 adaptor. Most of the monitors
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
shipping today have signal cables with a DB15 connect
ion, whereas Jay used
the older DB9 standard on his cards. If you need the bigger size and can
afford the price, the NEC makes for less hassle, since you will have the
adaptor ready to plug into the ISAC or AlberTT.

     I just got the FLEXVISION 14", which was designed by MAG. It was only
$329 plus shipping. Obviously, I couldn't afford the more expensive
monitors, but I'm sure I'll be really happy when my ISAC card comes in!
Imagine having a screen just slightly bigger than the SC1224, but with 1024
x 768 resolution and 16 colors instead of 320 x 200 at 16 colors!
                  (W.JESSOP, CAT4, TOP28, MSG:42/M475)

>>>>>   I hope I don't sound too much like a wet blanket but a 14" monitor
"""""   is really too small for 1024x768. The text gets so small it will be
hard to read.  800x600 is about the practical limit for a 14" screen.  You
might want to see about getting the parts with your new board to do
800x600.          (J.SPANDE, CAT4, TOP28, MSG:43/M475)

>>>>>   To get an idea of size just take your monitor width in inch's and
"""""   divide it by the number of pixels.  That will give you the number
of pixels per inch.  Since a desktop Icon is 32 pixels you can then see
what size they'll be on different monitors.

     My Atari monitor is 13" diagonal and the display width is roughly
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?

9-3/8" at 640 pixels.  That's roughly 68 pixels per i
nch.  If I tried to
display 1024 on my monitor I would have roughly 109 pixels per inch.  Now
to find your Icon width in inchs take 1" and divide by your pixels per inch
68 then multiple that by 32 (the width of your Icon).  You can see at 640
my Icons are 15/32" and at 1024 there only 9/32" wide.

     If you want an idea, take the monitor you have now and figure out the
resolution your currently using.  You can also figure out what display
width you'll need to get the size icons you want.  In order for me to keep
the same 68 pixels per inch, I would have to take 1024, divide by 68.  That
tells me I roughly need a 15" display width.  I think monitors are roughly
at a 3:4 ratio so you can figure the height to be 11-1/4".  So you could
figure out the diagonal measurement using that famous triangle formula
c2=a2+b2.:-)  Anyway that works out to 18.75"  so roughly I would need a
19" monitor to have the same size Icons at 1024 pixel width.  That's
basically why I said don't get smaller then a 17".:-)  Plus I've used a 17"
with the AlberTT and the Icons are smaller then what I would consider
normal.            (REALM, CAT4, TOP28, MSG:47/M475)


Some Suggestions   Panasonic PanaSync C1391 will work, they are no longer
""""""""""""""""   being made but can be found in Computer Shopper at cost
out price of $290 - $330 a nice monitor with all the controls up front, I
have one of these.
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?

     NEC 3D will work, there are refurbished monitors for sale in computer
shopper for $399. This is the most versatile for the ST, in has dash pot
controls up front that allow you to program where your screen should be
centered in each rez. I have been told it has a better Hi Rez mode then the
PanaSync.

     ACER 7015 will work, some people like this monitor, I had one for 10
days then sent it back, I thought it had terrible Hi Rez, my PanaSync is 10
times the quality of the ACER in Hi Rez.

     Sony 1302 works very good, it has the best Hi Rez mode I have seen on
the ST, it has a different cable then most of the other Multi-Sync
monitors, so a adapter will be needed or you might have to build your own
switch box on this one. $450 - $590.

     Princeton Ultra 1400 works a has a good Hi Rez mode, $399

     All of these monitors can be found in Computer Shopper. I would
suggest the NEC 3D or the ATY Multi-Sync monitor. If cost is a factor you
maybe able to find the Pana
Sync C1391 for around $290. It does not have as
good Hi Rez mode as the NEC or ATY monitor, but it is still very good.
Color on all of these monitors is as good as the Atari color monitor or
better.

Board + Monitor Upgrades   Well guys, I got my ISAC board allright, but
""""""""""""""""""""""""   due to ignorance on my part (and lack of
information proliferation on this topic!) I am still on my old monitors. So
now I'm awaiting some TOS 1.4 ROMs (which are being supplied by a very kind
helper--hip hip hooray for Jim Allen!) so I can be up and flying in
high-res color. Of course, in the meantime I had to learn the hard way,
unrigging and re-rigging my computer hutch, dropping the new monitor on my
foot, OUCH!!   ;&( (which, as you can see above, got my nose bent out of
shape!!)

     So, in the interest of cutting away injury & ignorance, and
proliferating important information (and for all you guys & gals starting
to think about upgrading your monitor output ability),

LET IT BE KNOWN:

Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
To operate an ISAC board with a multisync monitor you
 absolutely must:

     1)  Have TOS ROMS of version 1.4 or above

     2)  Download the Atari CPX software (do a search under XCONTROL)

     3)  Have a multisync monitor that has a maximum horizontal scan
         frequency of AT LEAST 48kHz (higher is OK) NON-Interlaced.

     4)  Download file #21647 (Extended Palette Driver ver. 1.0) which
         gives you 4096 colors to choose from instead of just 512... not
         too shabby! I've been told that this tiny AUTO folder TSR program

         D-shell (SVGA- which most monitors today come with), unless your

         plug right into the ISAC).

     For those of you without a lot of money for a new multisync monitor,
I just saw a DAMARK catalog with a TAXAN 15" flat-square tube monitor, with
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
1024 x 768 at .28 mm dot pitch (I'm assuming its hori
zontal scan ratio will
be high enough and that it is Non Interlaced--only a call to them will
tell).  Price: only $499...not a bad deal for a nice monitor. If you can't
afford that, you'll have to go down to the 14" monitors made by many and
available for $320 to $400 + shipping. Most experienced ones recommend 16"
or larger.        (W.JESSOP, CAT4, TOP28, MSG:58/M475)

Math Chip, Is It For Me?   The math chip _socket_ is claimed to be standard
""""""""""""""""""""""""   on every Falcon030. It should be a simple
matter to install the chip or have your dealer do it.

     Depending on what you plan to do with your Falcon030, you may not
even need the 68882. Since it only assists with "Floating Point" math,
having one will not just simply make the computer faster. It _can_ make 3-D
graphics faster. I _cannot_ speed up your desktop (like warp9). It _can_
make your DTP

 program scale and rotate quickly. It _cannot_ make your "LZH"
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?

or "ARC" program quicker. Of course you may be aware 
of this already and I
apologize if I'm repeating what you already know. I just see a lot of PC
users complaining because they just spent $150 on a coprocessor and their
"Windows" is not faster. Sometimes they accuse the math chip of not
functioning...

     However, it is important to point out that the math coprocessor is
also useless unless you have software which is "Coprocessor Aware". Since
the ST lacked any way of installing a math chip for many years, most
software is written assuming none is present.  Most of the high-end
graphics and CAD programs for the ST/TT have been updated to use the chip,
and their speed will be improved greatly by installing the chip. The
majority of other programs which you may have do not know how to access the
math chip, and will not see any improvement with one, provided they even do
floating point math to begin with.

     Also of importance: most "math intensive" games, like flight
simulators and other 3-D graphics games achieve their speed through
mathematical "cheats" and other tricks, and probably will never use the
math chip either, since "cheating" is often faster than a fast math chip
that "plays by the rules".

     If you do a lot of CAD and perhaps DTP and Graphics (especially
RayTracing and 3-D rendering) then the 68882 is for you, but you have to
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
get software which uses it. If you plan to use the Fa
lcon030 for games,
word processing, and telecommunication, you may want to wait on it.

True Color Explained   I'm glad you asked about "true color". Allow me to 
""""""""""""""""""""   clear up what I perceive to be a misinterpretation 
I believe you are having, from your post.

     "True Color" doesn't mean "unlimited colors", as you inquired about.
There are varying definitions of "True Color". Since this _is_ a topic
about the Falcon030, we will start with "True Color" as defined by Atari.
In a nutshell, they say that "True Color" is a graphics mode where a given
number of bits is taken from RAM, and the binary number those bits
represent is a color value which is placed on the screen as 1 pixel. In the
Atari ST, the colors are represented by a group of bits in RAM which
contain a binary number also.  However, that binary number is _not_ a
direct color value, instead it is the number of a "palette box" which
contains a binary number which is then used to color the pixel on the
screen.

     The advantage of using a "palette box" is that you make the palette
box big enough to hold as many bits as your design/price dictates, and you
can keep screen RAM down to a small size because you only need enough bits
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
of screen ram for each pixel group to represent the n
umber of "Palette
Boxes" you have included in the computer. This is why the ST can display
"16 out of 512" colors. The ST has 16 "Palette Boxes" (you only need 4 bits
of screen RAM to choose one of them), while each "Palette Box" is big
enough to hold 8 red intensities, 8 green intensities, and 8 blue
intensities (8 x 8 x 8 = 512 colors, which would require 9 "True Color"
bits to display).  So, this makes a cost saving technique of providing a
lot more _possible_ colors to choose from.

     Many people suggest that "True Color" mode simply does not have
"Palette Boxes", and displays each group of bits in screen RAM as whatever
color it is.

     Is truth stranger than fiction? You be the judge... going by this
definition of "True Color", your ST is displaying "True Color" when in the
monochrome mode. 1 bit of screen RAM represents the actual color of 1
screen pixel. The "Palette Box" concept is gone. (The Palette is used for
another function in monochrome, however. But this is not important now.)

     The "True Color" mode of the Falcon030 uses 16 bits of screen RAM to
represent any of 65,536 different colors. Many SVGA cards use 24 bits of
screen RAM to represent any of over 16 _Million_ different colors.

     As for the color detection ability of the human eye... it varies from
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?

one person to another. I'm sure everyone here has an 
opinion, and I do not
have any documented proof from experts to say a specific figure. I was told
by Bob Brodie words to the effect that most people cannot distinguish
between a screen with 16 million and a screen with 65000 colors. This is
perhaps true. I have no reason to doubt it.

     I will say that I have been told that the human eye is many times
better at distinguishing _shades_ (or intensities) of colors, than
distinguishing different _colors_ themselves. This brings us to a critical
point. It is up to you to decide for yourself what you feel is important,
after you read what I am about to say:

     I have been told that the Falcon030 is capable of displaying a
MAXIMUM of 64 _different_ shades of green (a maximum of 32 for red and
blue) in "True Color" mode.  (The ST has a maximum of 8 for a reference
point) A 24 bit "True Color" card for the PC can display a maximum of 256
_different_ shades of _any_ color. (There are special cards which I have
been told can do more than this) So, what does that mean to you??? Well, if
you're an artist and you're drawing a blue sky which fades from blue at the
horizon near the bottom of the screen, and black at the top of the screen,
your "sky" will consist of 32 "bands" of blue each one a little brighter
than the one above. Since your eye can _easily_ detect 32 different
_intensities_, you will be able to distinctly see each shade as a band. In
a 24 bit "true color" PC, your sky will have 256 bands of color each one
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
much closer in intensity to the one above and below i
t than on the
Falcon030. in fact, most people agree that with 256 shades, the transition
is imperceptible, and you "see" a smooth transition from black to blue.
There are techniques of "stippling" adjacent shades in computers with small
numbers of possible shades, and these work well even in a lot of ST
graphics you probably have seen (only 8 shades).

     So, you will have to judge for yourself based on what you perceive
what "True Color" means to _you_. Many people feel that "True Color" means
not less than 256 shades of each color. Other people feel that "True Color"
means the lack of "Palette Boxes". You make the call.

     I will say that a 16.8 million color hard copy from a photo printer
is visibly much better to my eye than the same picture printed in 65535
colors (stippled). The graduated shading is much smoother with 24 bits. On
the monitor I also see a difference, but not as great.

GEnie Made Easy   Sandy, it sounds to me like the 'dense' choice, but
"""""""""""""""   don't feel bad about it, I made the same mistake the
first time I tried it, and lots of others do it too. It stems from a
misunderstanding about what Aladdin is. It is _not_ intended to be a
terminal program, i.e. one that you operate 'live' and control while
online. It is meant to be setup offline (not connected to GEnie), tell it
to do an AutoPass 1, then it will automatically log on, get messages you
have 'told' it to get, check for new files in areas you specified, and then
hang up.  All this while you can be doing something else. Then you return,
read the new messages, compose answers, etc., pickout the listed new files
that you want to download, etc.

     When you are done with this, you tell it to do an Autopass 2. Then
Aladdin logs on, posts your replies, gets any messages posted to the topics
while you were reading an composing your reply, downloads the marked files
and then hangs up.

     It is your computer software robotics program for navigating GEnie
and getting what you want out of GEnie while you just sit and read a good
novel, have dinner, or whatever. It may take you a while to get the knack
of how to set it up, but once you learn that you'll wish every board and

service had such a front end.

     Basically the first thing you want to do is go to the File Menu and
configure RTs, i.e. pick the ones from the Product Index that you are
interested in. Click on the text that says something like Product page no.
and you will see the product index and then you can look thru' it for stuff
you want. Click on the days you want Aladdin to check that area, etc. The
tell Aladdin to update all topic lists. It will download the topic lists
for the RTs you have just set up. Go into the Roundtable menu and
mark/reply to topics to tell Aladdin which topics you want to ignore, and
which to read. Then you're ready for your first Autopass1.

     This was long, but the manual is longer. If you haven't downloaded
the manual, do so. RTFM, it takes a long time to absorb whats there but its
worth the effort. Try it you'll like it.

Calligrapher 3 Tips   Besides GDOS problems (which will no longer exist
"""""""""""""""""""   with version 3), the most common problem people have
had with Calligrapher has been in setting the paper size.  This problem
occurs because of a number of things.

     First, Calligrapher installs with a default paper size of "European
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
Fanfold". It's understandable that most folks dive in
 and try to print
before discovering this setting, which is buried in the "Paper Size" dialog
box.

     Second, if the user discovers the "Paper Size" dialog box, it is
logical to assume that he should just set it to "US Letter". However, this
is seldom the best setting.

     Third, the manual only briefly discusses the concept of "Physical
Page" and "Virtual Page" (on page 70).  This is a tutorial section of the
manual and not all users will have read this before printing.  If they have
printing problems, they would naturally turn to the section on printing,
which does not discuss this concept.  Furthermore, the concept is not very
clearly spelled out.

     What needs to be stressed is:

     The user must set his "Paper Size" to the "printable area" of his
printer.  This will vary from printer to printer, but is usually in the
neighborhood of 8.1 x 10.4.  This setting is made only once and is then
saved globally within Calligrapher.  The user need only be sure that his
"virtual page" is smaller than the paper size.  The width of the virtual
page is determined by the widest margin on any particular page.  The height
(Page Length) of the virtual page is set in th
e Customize box and is saved
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
with the document.  The virtual page is positioned wi
thin the physical page
by the settings of vertical and horizontal alignment in the preview and
print box.

     Aside from this downfall of the Calligrapher manual, there are very
few complaints.  It is very thorough -- so thorough that many people do not
fully read it (almost 400 pages) but use it only for reference since the
program is so intuitive.

will be more of a maintenance upgrade than anything.  The alphas we now

the support we get for our first upgrade.  I understand the need for "sound

...And Answers   David,  You didn't read my post very carefully...I said
""""""""""""""   that I would be popping in and out of here, and doing day
trips in the bay area. I'm not running away for two weeks.

     Sam did indeed realistically expect Falcons to hit in October, and the
date slipped for the US. There was a problem that I am not at liberty to
discuss, although I will say that it was not technical in nature. Among
other concerns were slow negotiations with companies for some of the
products that we want to have either bundled with the Falcon030, or have
available at the same time.  For example, the Photo-CD software is
something that we very much want to bundle with the Falcon030. However,
that contract wasn't signed until November. That creates a rather obvious
problem in shipping the software.

     The demand for units by developers (current, new, and returnees) has
been considerable. All across the globe Atari Falcon030s have been in high
demand.  While it is disappointing that they are not for sale in North
America, it is very encouraging to see the demand from developers is
extraordinarily high!  And it is for sale "on this planet", in Europe.

     I take exception to your "riiigghht" description about the re-design
of the ST Book, David. We were highly criticized by people right here for
the lack of the backlight on the ST Book. We explained the intent of the
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
unit, and the fact that backlighting it would dramati
cally reduce the
viability of the unit as a notebook. We went to NAMM and heard the very
same concerns...and reacted. "Without warning, we pulled the plug on the ST
Book." Hardly! We took the concerns of our dealers and users to heart and
have the unit in for re-design. If the "don't bother, it's no use"
sentiment of your message is indeed correct, I'll be happy to pass that
information along to the appropriate people here in Sunnyvale.

     And again, even though you don't like to hear it, we always indicated

that the main push was slated for January. We got the "what no Falcon for
Christmas?" messages _way back_ in August. It was felt that by being up
front and telling you realistically what we felt we could accomplish we
were doing the right thing. I still think that we were correct in being up
front about it. We should always tell what we can do, and when we  believe
we will be able to do it.

     Will the "story of the ST Book be the story of the Falcon030?" NO!
The ST Book was regarded as an addition to the existing lineup of
computers. It was/is, a highly portable unit. It's main technical
advantages were the incredible battery life, which was rejected by users
and dealers as significant. The Atari Falcon030 represents a substantial
technical advancement in personal computing. Publications like EQ recognize
that, so does Electronic Musician, Keyboard, people like Jerry Pournelle,
Craig Anderton, and CNN is talking extremely positive as well.

Shareware Concept Questioned...   >While some who never paid for PinHead
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   >might feel less guilty once they stop
>using it, that doesn't change the fact that they used it unethically for a
>period of time.

     Unethically?  As defined by whom?  Please explain the ethics, or lack
thereof, of shareware contributions.  Try to use the words "agreement",
"contract", and "property" in your answer.

     The fact of the matter is that the shareware concept exists because
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
programmers are sometimes too greedy to give their so
ftware away, but too
lazy to sell it commercially[1].  They may be naive enough to think they'll
make a lot of money in shareware, or they may just want anything they can
get.  When they don't make a whole lot, of course it isn't _their_ fault --
it's ours.

     So they embark upon a guilt-trip campaign in order to convince people
they should feel guilty about not paying for less-than-commercial software.
They claim _they_ are GOOD for releasing shareware instead of selling their
software commercially.  It's not true.  They are making their decisions
based on a cost/benefit analysis just like everyone else.  But when the
cost/benefit analysis others make end
s in a non-payment of shareware
"fees", those others are BAD, guilty, unethical, and according to JWEAVERJR
(in another topic) thieves.

     And if the messages in this topic are typical of the thoughts of the
majority, their campaign has been successful. It's a shame.

     Shareware is a stupid concept, plain and simple.  There are no ethics
on either side of the payment/non-payment argument.  No agreement or
contract for payment in exchange for service exists between the creator of
a piece of shareware, and it's users[2].  Therefore, no violation of an
agreement or contract takes place upon non-payment.

Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
     Say you download a piece of shareware.  You _hav
e_ it[3].  It is in
your possession by right.  This right is explicitly granted to you by the
software's creator at no cost to you.  The software has legally and
ethically changed hands.  Furthermore, you also hold the right to duplicate
and distribute copies of the software as you see fit.  You also have the
right to test the software to see what it does.  This is fine.

     The problem, however, is that the creator of the software says if you
use the software, you owe him money.  In other words, the creator of the
software claims the right to deny you the _use_ of software legally in your
possession.  Does such a right exist?  I don't think so.  Where else in life
do these rights exist?

     Shareware "fees" should be thought of as "contributions".  They are a
like putting $3 in the box at the museum that says "Requested Donation $3".
It may be good to contribute, but it's completely optional.  There is no
legal or ethical requirement to do so[4].


 Footnotes:

 [1] This is not to say that there is anything wrong with either. It
     is just a statement of fact.
 [2] This doesn't include "shareware" for which, when you send in your
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?

     money, you get something else back, like a poste
r or a different
     version of the software.  In these instances, the "shareware" is
     not a product at all, it's an advertisement.  The money you pay
     is for the poster, or the new version, and it a legitimate
     purchase.
 [3] You don't _own_ it though, ownership is a not a concept involved
     in this discussion.

      and it certainly isn't the opinion of our company, because

      we won't be releasing any products as shareware any time soon.

...And Answers   I used the word "unethically" for exactly the same reason
""""""""""""""   that you posted your opinions.  I fully realize that many
people don't accept the facts in the shareware concept so I thought I would
give them the benefit of the doubt and not call them crooks.  Instead, I
implied that they were simply unethical.   You ask "As defined by whom?".
As defined by the federal laws of the United States of America.

     Since you decided to dispute the "rights" of shareware authors, I'll
give you a few facts.  A shareware program is protected by its copyright in
the same way that any commercial program is protected. Assuming that the
author has correctly displayed his copyright and stated clearly the means
by which he allows the distribution of his software, the users of that
software are bound _by_the_copyright_law_ to honor the copyright.

      >They claim _they_ are GOOD for releasing shareware instead of
      >selling their software commercially.

     Who claims this?  Maybe one author, or maybe more than one author,
although I personally have not seen these claims.  You're certainly not
implying that _every_ author claims this, are you?

     It has nothing to do with guilt-trips.  You can whine all you like
about what you may perceive as the greed or laziness of an author, but that
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
does not diminish his right to copyright his work.  I
f you don't like it,
you can do what you please.  But if you are violating the copyright of an
author's work, you are breaking a federal law, whether you feel there's an
"agreement or contract" or not.

     >Say you download a piece of shareware.  You _have_ it[3].  It is in
     >your possession by right.  This right is explicitly granted to you by
     >the software's creator at no cost to you.  The software has legally
     >and ethically changed hands.

     Herein lies the flaw in your supposition.  The downloading of
shareware is only one part of the distribution process (assuming that the
author has clearly stated his copyright terms).  Yes, the right to download
it is "explicitly granted", but the right to _use_ it carries additional
stipulations.  The software has NOT "legally and ethically changed hands".
An evaluation _copy_ of the software has been made under the terms of the
author's copyright agreement.  To use that software on a regular basis
requires additional compensation as requested by the author.  Otherwise,
the copyright has been violated.

     You're perfectly entitled to your opinion that "Shareware is a stupid
concept", but that doesn't change the law or the facts.
                (J.EIDSVOOG1, CAT18, TOP19, MSG:25/M475)
 
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?

And Continuing...   In thinking about my posts on this subject, I realize
"""""""""""""""""   that it probably sounds as if I am defending the
concept of shareware.  I'm not.  I'm am defending the rights of software
_authors_, no matter what type of software they right (as pointless as it
is to argue with some people who refuse to face facts).

     As for my views on the actual concept of shareware, I really don't
care much one way or the other.  I feel it has its place.  I have no
illusions that I can make any money at shareware.  Most of the five
programs I've released as shareware have been written for my own needs.
Rather than hoard them for myself, I decided to basically "give" them away
by offering them as shareware.  I really didn't expect to make any money
from them, but didn't want to release them as freeware either, for a couple
of reasons.

     To me, there is a certain level of software that should be freeware.
If a program reaches beyond this level, it devalues other commercial
software to release it for free.  Computer users then get the idea that
it's easy to write software, and that commercial software, including
shareware, is overpriced (if its price is more than zero). This leads to
piracy and a lot of complaining from those who are greedy and feel the
world owes them something.

Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
     The other criterion I use to release something a
s shareware instead of
freeware is the simple amount of time it takes me to write documentation
and prepare a package for release.  The software, I write for myself.  But
the documentation is purely for the user.  So I consider the dismal
response I get for shareware to be a payment for the extra effort I made to
prepare my personal tools to offer to the public (although it's really
supposed to compensate the author for writing the software).

     I fully realize that the shareware I've released is mostly niche
tools which will not be widely used by a lot of people.  So I don't expect
to get the number of payments that I'd expect if I'd written ArcShell or
XYZ or Superboot.  In fact, some of my shareware is actually freeware when
obtained by the purchase of CodeHead's commercial software but shareware if
obtained otherwise.  So most people are using those particular programs
without paying shareware, because they've purchased CodeHead software.

     I couple of people have expressed curiosity as to how well other
shareware has done.  Here is an accounting of the shareware I've received
in the last four years:

                     Product   # of Payments  Total
                     --------  -------------  -----
                     TopDown        8         $125

                    Totals        29        $425.52

     I know these figures may shock some people.  I know others will think
I'm "whining" (even though the above statements should show otherwise).
Maybe it will show some authors that there's no pot of gold at the end of
the Atari rainbow.

     (NOTE: I know I said before that I had received a payment for Captain
Hook, but I was mistaken.  I thought I remembered receiving a payment, but
I can't find any record of it.)

     Above all, please do NOT view this post as a "guilt trip".  If you're
looking at those figures and think you should send me a payment out of
sympathy, I don't want your money.  That is not the purpose of this post.

>>>>>   While I wouldn't classify Shareware as 'stupid', I would say it
"""""   would take a very idealistic, or unknowledgeable, shareware author
to think he/she is going to make much money from shareware - at least in
the U.S. ST market.

     There are many reasons behind my statement, and others have already
stated most of them much better than I can (basic nature of shareware,
human nat- ure, low numbers of users, etc)  But one reason that I haven't
seen stated is the length of ownership of the users in the U.S. ST market.

     As we all know,  there are very few new users ST users anymore. Most
of us have had our ST's several years.  As such, we don't add much new
software to our libraries.  I know that I can go months and never add
anything  new to my hard drive (besides normal upgrades, data files, etc).
No matter how good a new ARCShell 'clone' might be, I already have one that
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
I'm used to using, that does a good job and I have al
ready paid for it. It
would take an exceptional ARCShell 'clone' for m
e to move. BUT if there
were more new users (the total number of users could remain constant), many
of these new users would buy the new 'clone' instead of the older version.
The same goes for just about any other type of software.  Until the
Falcon030 gets to the new users, shareware will be a losing proposition for
99% of the shareware authors - IMO.

     Also, I disagree with some definitions of what is shareware. Some
speak of disabling some features in a shareware program.  IMO, this means
the pro- gram is no longer shareware, it has become a fully 'commercial'
program that has a demo version.  What is the difference between it and the
mono demo of Calligrapher 3?   Would you call this version of Calligrapher
3 'disabled shareware'?  The only difference is how the non-disabled
version is distributed - instead of just via the author, it's also
distributed via dealers, etc.

     IMO, 'true' shareware is a fully working copy that I have a choice of
testing at my leisure, and then either paying for it or throwing it away.

 I'm sure that if we were in contact with the right people at Atari

 this point the lack of machines may be a distraction from the central
 issue.  There isn't yet a demonstrated base of current owners of the

 You have a point about the playing field leveling in 870 (old host).
 I worry that it may be too sparse in there, but if you folks want to
 use it and we see the activity, we will keep an arena for you.  There
 will be no changes to the Atari FE's unless a Falcon version can be
 justified, but the host will be up to date with the other hosts that
 are active on ARIES.   Are we replaying the New Coke  Old Coke
 scenario?!

 Best wishes,

     Well, there's an offer there, of sorts. We can have an ST area, IF we
can keep it busy enough to justify it. They WILL upgrade the AW FE to the
Falcon (and I hope TT) IF Atari can show some numerical strength.


     BTW, I had suggested that they incorporate the head to head mode into

the final ST FE as a parting gift.<g> Oh well.

'Authorized' Dealer List Wanted   I had a problem a year and a half ago
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   with a former Atari dealer who was no
longer an authorized dealer. It caused a delay of several months in getting
a Mega STE, which I ultimately got from DRYS, and I didn't understand why
the "dealer" wasn't able to get product from Atari. A list of dealers that
is kept current would be very helpful. I suppose, though, if the list is
short, it would be embarrassing to Atari and could erode confidence.

they can join the ranks of real computists... the Atarians.  At least
there's more hope for the 'Duhhhh' struck Macians then there is for the

Copyright Twist   There has been some discussion on the topics of
"""""""""""""""   copyrights for fonts, but there has been a tremendous
setback to just that.  A recent Federal decision on a particular software
product said that the product could be copyrighted, but the producer could
not forbid uses that are contrary to good public policy.  Such as,
disassembly of protected code and forbidding of code in particular products
or hardware.

     This could have forbidden products from allowing add-ons with invasive
code.  Say, the TOS ROMs could forbid use of shells or unapproved fonts or
unapproved graphics on the desktop.  If you copyright it, you must allow
use.

     A font program or font name is copyrightable.  The font design is
NOT. If you can design a copy that a court could not reasonably assume was
derivative of the original program, then you are free to.  This is fairly
easy for Type 1's and exceptionally hard for GDOS or GEM fonts because the
structure is so rigid.


Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
     About fair use for copyrighted software or fonts
, courts have
generally held that public interest is paramount and onerous or grievous
licensing is unlawful.  I can't print a book and then put a license in it
that forbids your reading it based on your religion or race.  If it is in
your possession you must be allowed fair use (I love the one that says you
can't resell it without notifying the producer's lawyers by registered
letter of your intent to sell).  However remember there must be a
significant change in your code if you intend to SELL it.  And be prepared
to be sued if you want to go against the big guys.  They can keep you in
court long enough to forget what the suit was originally about.

     Finally, if you are using it for your own uses, and I mean PERSONAL,
if you purchased it or own it legally you are free to do just about
anything you want to and that includes conversions.

Falcon Manufacturing Woes   I'm sure all Atari is angry at the factory
"""""""""""""""""""""""""   which did things all wrong...  I would like to
know more details about the Q/A findings and the factory, so I can be angry
too.

     Did Atari went their usual penny-pinching way? and sub-contracted to
the cheapest oriental factory possible?  With inexperienced workers paid 50
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
cents a day, doing 80 hours a week... or something li
ke that... WHY was
that factory so bad??  Did Atari gamble on the choice of factory?

     On a more positive note, this extra waiting period, until March, can
be good.

THE GOOD:  - Prices likely to fall
           - More software bundled
           - More time to save money
           - More software available at time of purchase
           - It is worth the wait

THE BAD:   - Competition becoming more and more tempting
           - Long winter months ahead
           - Patience running off
           - Hits Atari's credibility
           - May scare away developers

Falcon Memory Configurations   No he wasn't kidding. 
Actually, it is 16 meg
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   but, in that configuration, only 14 meg is
usable by the user. The other 2 meg is used for the system to do stuff.
Those extra 2 meg is only used by the system in the 16 meg configuration.
The 1 & 4 meg configuration gives the user all the ram (minus what TOS,
etc.) takes up.

     The Falcon uses 4meg X 1 drams (or 1meg X 4). The price comes out to
pretty much the same as SIMMS in the catalogs. The prices I have seen from
dealers though are about $60 per meg which is WAY to high. I'll just
upgrade it myself cheaper. There are people supposedly working on memory
upgrade boards. Zram (I think) issued a press release price of $250.00 for
an unpopulated upgrade board. These people must be on some kind of drugs.
The Atarians that have been around know better about this kind of price
but, the unsuspecting consumer could get burnt.

     Well, I just received the February issue of Byte and guess what I
found.  They had a small review on the Falcon030 in the News "First
Impressions" section. Overall (for a quick review), it was pretty good.
From the way the article was written, they were impressed. The title says
"Atari's Falcon030 Leads the Pack". It talks about the DSP and gives a
general rundown of the features. He said that he plugged in a guitar and
used Musicom to add some special effects and then played it back while
mixing in a lead guitar and recording it onto tape. The article also talks
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
about some of the ports that it includes like, DSP, L
ocalTalk, SCSI-2, etc.

     A pretty good review for one page. It's about time they noticed.
                (R.WATSON15, CAT14, TOP41, MSG:68/M475)

>>>>>   Actually, I tried in the past to find someone who could say what
"""""   would happen if you populated only 8 megs in the falcon030. I'd say
that you could populate this amount, and then tell TOS that the unpopulated
portion was allocated to some bogus program, and it should work. Nobody has
been able to answer this yet.

     In the falcon030, you populate 16Megs, but only can use 14 of them.
The other 2Megs are not accessible because they reside at the same
addresses as the physical I/O and ROM in the machine. Coming from the 8-bit
I _know_ you understand what I mean. It's like having that last 16K in an
800XL that resides 'under' the ROM and I/O register locations. The problem
here is that there doesn't seem to be any way of 'enabling' that extra 2
Megs 'under' there. All accounts say that it is _useless_. (Maybe it helps
keep the other chips nice and warm or something).

     They could have moved the ROM and I/O higher in the address space,
but that would have caused way too many incompatibility problems. There is
talk of adding "TT RAM" in the addresses following the 16 Meg top, too.

     Other surprises might include: 16Mhz clock rate,

T.J.,

     No, I'm not including you (or anyone in particular) in the group
possessing the "attitude" I posted.  And no, the statement "shareware is
Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?
crazy" makes no more sense to me than "shareware is s
tupid".  Your analogy
of comparing shareware to someone giving you his car keys to try out for a
while doesn't make sense -- it's simply not practical. Shareware is
practical.

     You seem to feel the need to define shareware by some concrete,
strictly- defined rules.  That's not the point of it.  To me it seems
pointless to take this discussion into such an area.  Shareware is a
flexible honor system. It's flexible because authors use such widely varied
means for distributing their shareware.  It's an honor system because it
relies on individual integrity to work.

     Of course, retail software is distributed by an honor system, too. The
producers of software rely on the honor of their customers not to make
illegal copies of their software -- much like audio and video recordings.
All of this is backed by law, but it's not practical or worth the time and
money to chase this type of theft.  Instead, the theft is absorbed by the
consumer, just like it is in retail stores with petty shoplifting.  We
_all_ pay for this in higher prices.  That's why it makes sense for us to
try to instill a sense of integrity in our society -- a respect for one's
self and for others.  When the stakes rise to a high enough point, the
judicial system gets involved, but at the petty level we all pay for the
wrong-doings of others.  Anyway, let's get back to the discussion of
shareware.

     If you can't find a shareware author because he's no longer around,
ask your own conscience whether you should continue using it.  Have you
made an attempt to find him?  This whole concept only works (or doesn't
work) based on the individual consciences of each user.

     Nobody's going to throw you in jail because you haven't paid a
shareware fee,especially if you can't find the author.  Why not just accept
the "standard" shareware rule that has been given here over and over:

      - If you use it, pay for it.

     If you have to cover every possible condition and occurrence with
strict rules,then you're not understanding the concept.  It's based on
trust.  The author trusts that you'll be fair.  If you don't know what's
fair, ask yourself.  Ask your own conscience.  Ask yourself how you'd feel
if you had spent your valuable time and talent to produce the software in
question and how you'd feel about a person using it in the way you're using
it.

     This should tell you whether you should pay or not.  Not everyone
will answer the question the same way.  The world is full of a lot of
different kinds of people and they all have different kinds of consciences.
Some will never pay for anything that they can take and get away with it.
I certainly am not going to lose any sleep over these people.

     But what makes me lose a lot of sleep is people (not you, or anyone in
particular) who are doing the equivalent of "inciting to riot". Some
people's consciences bother them a little, because they know they're doing
the wrong thing.  They can't seem to steer themselves straight.  Instead of
doing the right thing to eliminate the bother, they speak out in an attempt
to convince others to join them in not doing the right thing -- as if this
will justify what they're doing wrong, and fix their consciences (it
doesn't).

     Jails are full of these kinds of people -- gangs are full of these
kinds of people -- pirate BBSes are full of these kinds of people.  Of
course, my problem with losing sleep over this type of person, should not
be made into _your_ problem, or anyone else's -- just as someone else's
problem with their own conscience shouldn't be forced on others.

     In closing, I'd be happy to give you my _broad_ definitions of the
various types of software:

Public Domain:   PD software is completely free and everyone is free to do
                 anything they please with it.  It may or may not have an
                 author's name(s) attached to it.  It may or may not
                 include the source code.  But it definitely should not
                 have a copyright on it.  Otherwise, it wouldn't be public
                 domain.  (Actually, after a copyright expires, the work
                 becomes public domain, but no software has been around
                 long enough to reach this state.)

Freeware:   Freeware is a gift from the author to everyone.  It _usually_
            contains a copyright (and should).  There is no obligation on
            the part of the user of freeware, other than to leave it
            unmodified and distribute it only in the form that the
            copyright holder has specified.

Commercial:   Commercial software is any software which is "sold" for a
              purchase price.  It includes basically two types of software
              -- shareware and retail.

  Shareware:   Some commercial software is distributed as shareware.  This
               covers a wide range of distribution methods.  Some of it is
               distributed as a fully-working version.  Some is distributed
               as a demo or in a crippled form, whereby the author will
               provide the full version directly to the purchaser upon
               receipt of payment.  All of these methods are valid, but the
               linking factors are the facts that the software is
               distributed in electronic form or by hand, the publisher has
               asked for payment for the software, and the software is not
               available from retail outlets.

  Retail:   This is software which is purchased through a retail outlet.
            It may be available from mail-order outlets as well, or
            directly from the publisher, but it is always a "purchase" of
            the type that we can all understand (and no one seems to
            dispute) -- you pay for it and you get it.

     I'd like to make one more point about software.  The _only_ "owner"
of a copyrighted piece of software is the copyright holder.  When you
purchase software, whether it's shareware or retail, or even if you've
obtained a copyrighted piece of freeware, you do NOT own it.  The copyright
holder is the owner.  He has provided you with a "copy" of his property.

     If you've purchased a retail software package, you own the physical
materials that comprise the package, and you own the media on which the
software and documentation is contained, but you do NOT own the copyrighted
material contained on it.  You may sell the retail package to another party
by transferring the physical contents of the package to the purchaser,
along with the rightfully obtained "copy" of the copyrighted work contained
on the media.

John

     P.S.  It really is silly to try to offer all these reasons why
shareware "doesn't work".  The real problem here is that it doesn't work in
the _Atari_ market.  There are many shareware authors for the PC that make
far more money than the owners of CodeHead Technologies do.

                              [*][*][*]


     You might have noticed the emphasis on shareware debate in this
     months 'Hey Mister Postman' coverage.  This happened for two
     reasons - First, it is an explosively important issue, especially
     for the Atari platform.  There are many utilities that make the
     ST & TT line of computers more productive and easier to use, and
     many of these are shareware!  I would shudder to think of not
     having PinHead, or the myriad of other programs, that I have had
     the _luxury_ of downloading, trying and deciding to use and pay
     or archive and upload (so that others may have the same luxury).
     Second, since it is so explosive, many of the messages have been
     purged from the topic (and uploaded to the library), so I wanted
     to give you a sort of 'Shareware Message Reading' - If you find
     them interesting, please download the archive from the library!

     Remember, if you find something interesting, you can use the
     message information line to quickly jump to that section and
     get "the rest of the story." (See the beginning of GEnieLamp for
     the lowdown on how to read and use the message info line)

Safe Fax
""""""""



                 >>> THE FRIENDLY GUIDE TO SAFE FAX <<<
                 """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
          Dr. B. Comfortable answers some of your questions....

Q.:  Doctor, I am new to fax, I have not had much fax, and I am worried.
     Is it safe to have fax?
A.:  Fax is perfectly safe, providing both you and your partner maintain
     your equipment in good order, keep it clean and have a regular
     check-up by a qualified consultant.  Do not be embarrassed at your
     lack of experience.  There are many excellent fax manuals available,
     including my own "The Joy of Fax".

Q.:  About how often should I fax?
A.:  Those who are new to fax often can't get enough, and do it all the
     time.  We usually find, however, that as we get older and the novelty
     wears off, the desire for fax decreases rapidly, particularly if we
     still have the same old machine.  (It is not unknown for jaded faxers
     to have a brief "fling" with a new, exciting machine, but this, too,
     will usually burn out quite quickly.)

Q.:  Can I have fax with more than one person?
A.:  By all means.  This is perfectly normal, even necessary in most
     circumstances.  It is time we cast aside our hang-ups about fax, feel
     free to "let it all hang out" and share your true self with the world.

Q.:  Do I have to be married to have fax?
A.:  Good Lord, no.  People who hardly ever fax their wives will spend
     most of their working lives faxing complete strangers.

Q.:  My parents say they never had fax when they were young, and were only
     allowed to write memos to each other until they were twenty-one, is
     this true?
A.:  Yes, but why worry about boring old twits like them?

Q.:  If I fax something to myself, will I go blind?
A.:  Certainly not, as far as I can see.

Q.:  There is a place on our street now, where you can go and pay to fax,
     is this legal?
A.:  Yes.  Many lonely people have no other outlet for their fax drives and
     must pay a "professional" when their need for fax becomes too strong.

Q.:  What are the consequences of indiscriminate fax?
A.:  Very high telephone bills.

If it ain't broke....

                             ~ Maybe NOT! ~

     You'd be surprised at the number of Atari systems that make their way
into our service department for repair that have absolutely nothing wrong
with them; or worse yet, the number that actually did have nothing wrong
with them before their owner decided to open up the case to "fix"
something.
  
     Our Atari computer systems are, like most of today's high-tech
electronic equipment, extremely well-built and reliable.  But, like most of
today's highly specialized equipment, they are also unforgiving of things
like "user errors".  Give your computer incorrect commands, or instructions
which conflict with another set of instructions previously entered, and
you've given it no choice but to object.  That objection frequently takes
the form of a system lockup or crash.
  
     While it seems that most folks are quick to blame such malfunctions on
the hardware itself, the fact of the matter is that rarely are such system
crashes actually due to a faulty item of hardware.  Most are caused by
software errors, conflicts with ACCessory programs and programs that are
preloaded from your AUTO folder upon bootup, or most commonly, user errors.
I know we hate to admit that we may be responsible for that irritating
system crash, but in most cases, the system is balking because of something
that will be directly related to something we ourselves have done that has
asked the computer to do something outside its design capability.
  
     So, what should you do when faced with system malfunctions such as the
ones described above?  First, you should probably take a short break, get a
cup of coffee and a piece of pie, or whatever else will allow you to cool
off and forget all that data that you just lost because you waited too long
between saves, so you'll be able to think the problem through more
logically and calmly.  Then ask yourself just what did you do before the
malfunction occurred.  What commands did you issue to the computer?  Did
you just recently add something to your AUTO folder, or change the order of
programs in the AUTO folder?  Did you recently add a new ACCessory program?
Did you do something in an order that you haven't done before?
  
     One thing to NOT do is to immediately tear apart the computer itself
to look inside and mess with things you're not qualified to mess with.  If
it ain't broke, don't fix it!  You can't!!!  And even if it is broke,
unless you're trained, qualified and have the proper diagnostic equipment
and tools, you probably won't be able to "fix" anything anyway.  But you
can, and most likely will, damage something in the process.
  
     Over the years, we've seen an incredible number of damaged systems in
our service department that wouldn't have needed repair if the owner hadn't
opened up the case.  Have you ever walked across a carpet in the winter and
gotten a shock when you reached for the doorknob?  Do you have any idea of
what that can do to a computer chip when you touch it?  Hello La-La land!
And that static charge may not destroy the chip immediately -- it may cause
a gradual breakdown that may take days or even weeks before a total failure
occurs, making it seem even more like the next problem wasn't even related
to something you might have done.
  
     Believe it or not, we've had systems come in for service that have had
chips installed backwards or installed in the wrong sockets, or chips with
broken or bent pins.  As soon as we see the warranty seal has been broken,
we always expect the worst, and of course ask what has been done to the
system before it was brought in.  Nobody wants to admit that they did
something stupid, but it really makes the job of a service technician a lot
more difficult if you don't give him all the facts to work with.  So, how
did those chips get screwed up?  How do you think?  Believe it or not,
we've had customers with such systems try to tell us they really didn't
open up the case, and the chips must've always been that way.  Right!
  
     We've also had customers come in carrying a handful of IC's in their
had and ask us to check them to see if they're good.  They're not any more!
Remember that static buildup from walking across the carpet?
  
     I've had customers come in carrying the drum from their laser printer
and ask us to check it.  No need to any more.  That pretty green coating is
light sensitive; that's how the thing works.  Do you know what happens to
photographic film if you expose it to the sunlight?  Hello La-La land, you
have another visitor!
  
     We've had systems come in with loose screws rolling around internally
and other internal parts missing, or dip switches incorrectly thrown, or
jumpers incorrectly placed or missing.  How do you think they got that way?
And how do you really think those broken traces on the circuit board got
cut?  Or how did that solder joint wind up shorting out between several
contact points?  No, it didn't come from the factory that way and take all
these months or years before the system finally stopped working!
  
     Remember that little warranty seal on the bottom of the computer?  Why
do you think Atari put it there?  It's not because they're trying to be
mean to their customers.  They're just trying to remind you that you really
don't belong inside the case.  There are no end user adjustments or
controls inside the case.  But there are a lot of sensitive parts that you
can easily damage.
  
     Here's my own list of "10 Commandments" to follow when you encounter a
problem with your computer:
    
  1.  Don't immediately assume the computer is broken and tear open
      the case to look inside.  What do you think you're going to see
      anyway, a little chip waving a red flag telling you it's broken?
  
  2.  Try to document exactly what you recently did, and in what
      order.  Turn off the system and reboot.  If it comes back up
      properly, there's probably nothing "broken".
  
  3.  Try running another program.  If it runs OK, there's probably
      nothing wrong with your computer.  Try another diskette.  Does
      it format properly?  Speaking of diskettes, are you using good
      quality diskettes from a reputable manufacturer?  Would you
      really want to put "generic" oil in the crankcase of your new
      car?  ;-]
  
  4.  Don't open the case to "look" inside!
  
  5.  If the problem can be repeated, turn off ALL ACCessories and
      AUTO folder programs, and try again.  If the problem goes away,
      it's probably related to a software conflict with one of those
      ACCessories or AUTO folder programs.  Sometimes all it takes is
      changing the order of the programs in your AUTO folder to
      correct the problem.  Remember, the actual "order" they load
      isn't necessarily the order they're listed in on the directory
      window.  You will need a program such as AUTOSORT to view the
      actual order and change it around.  Check the GEnie library if
      you need such a program.  And when you re-enable those nifty
      utilities, turn them back on one at a time and recheck
      everything.  That way you'll be able to find out exactly which
      one caused the problem.
  
  6.  If you need to contact your dealer for help, have a list of the
      contents of your AUTO folder handy, as well as a list of active
      ACCessory programs you're using.  Document exactly what the
      problem is and what you were doing when it occurred.  Be ready
      to tell him, honestly, exactly what you've done to try to
      correct it, or what you might've done that could have caused it.
  
  7.  Don't open the case to "look" inside!
  
  8.  Don't immediately jump to conclusions and take drastic action
      such as reformatting the hard drive, or start disassembling the
      system.
  
  9.  If you choose to bring the system to a service center, bring in
      the entire system including all power supplies, cables,
      diskettes and programs that were being used when the problem
      occurred.  And remember, if the problem can't be repeated, it
      most likely wasn't caused by a "broken" piece of hardware.  More
      likely software or user error.
  
  10.  And finally, don't open the case to "look" inside!
  
     So, are you ready for your final exam?  There's just one question to
see if you pass or fail.  What do you think is the most important rule to
follow when you encounter a problem?  ;-]
  
     Seriously, folks, just remember:  "If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"
  
     Happy (Atari) Computing.

[*]More ST ZIP
""""""""""""""
By Mel Motogawa
   [M.MOTOGAWA]



                       >>> NEW AND IMPROVED! <<<
                       """""""""""""""""""""""""

     A fresh version of ST ZIP, version 2.1, has recently been uploaded to
the file library and is moving fast in the download counts (file #27231).
The reason why is not surprising.  The program can archive files close to,
and sometimes smaller, than LH5 lzh compression, with comparable-to-better
speed.  This archiver doesn't compress any smaller than 2.0, which
introduced the new Deflating routine, but has some bug fixes and a few new
features.  O.k., I realize I just wrote about ST Zip 2.0 back in November,
but I'm still learning new things about the program and thought I would
share them with you.

     The comment feature of ST Zip is superb for remembering what's in an
archive, or for saving some notes about a file within the archive.  You can
do either, attaching a comment to the archive as a whole (single click on
the archive name in the title bar of ST Zip's left file selector) or to
individual files (double-clicking on these, in the archive).  No more
forgetting what a file is for or you can use this feature to include brief
notes to others as to what's what in the archive.

     If you double-click on a filename in the right hand file selector, a
dialog will pop up with some basic information and now allows you to rename
the file, besides displaying it in ST Zip's file viewing window.

     A click on the right file selector's title bar rereads the directory
displayed.  This is handy if you've deleted some files from there via
another file maintenance accessory or alternate file selector and ST Zip
hasn't caught up with your changes.  To get to the system, or your
alternate, file selector while in ST Zip, I click on the close button of
the left file selector.  If you don't select anything in the file selector,
you'll drop back to the archive you were last using.

     You can control ST Zip via an external file.  I believe this feature
existed in previous versions, but I never got around to exploring it
previously.  What this means is that you can create an ASCII file of the
paths you'd like to back up and ST Zip will obey!  I find this extremely
helpful for backing up frequently used files that I'd like to keep in one
archive, updating it as needed.  I can back up my files in C:\ALADDIN,
C:\ALADDIN\DATA and D:\HOTFILES all in one operation.  This eliminates the
need for me to maintain several Hotwire menu slots for ST Zip, each backing
up one path.  It's kind of eerie to watch ST Zip parse the LIST.TXT file
and then go about its business archiving files here and there among my hard
disk partitions, but it sure saves time.  Via a command line, you can also
tell ST Zip to archive all the files in a directory, except certain
extenders.  Handy for when you want to back up everything except the
executables.  See the ST Zip docs for more information on how to set up an
external list and the command line options.

     I noticed that ST Zip displays the active drives right below the
"Help" Button.  Interestingly, if you add another drive, like installing a
ramdisk, a button for it now appears automatically when you then boot ST
Zip.  I don't know what will happen if you have more drives than A-L, since
it appears there's only enough room for that many drive letters.  You can
save the current configuration of drives ST Zip is using when you save your
configuration through the "Config" button.

     Clicking on the "Add mode" button brings up a dialog where you can
select whether your Add operation will be Normal, Freshen, Update or Add if
the file is newer than a certain date.

     I was sad to see that Zip Jr., the basic TTP version of ST Zip, is no
longer being included in the updates.  I guess everyone was using the
GEM-based version, but I appreciated the smaller size of Zip Jr., mating it
to the EDM Shell (file #24393) for fast and convenient conversions of ARC,
LZH and ZOO'd files to the ZIP format.  Oh well, at least the GEM-based
version accepts command line input just like Zip Jr., although it is larger
to accommodate the interface.

     Having a GEM-based interface built-in, ST Zip makes it very easy to
delete files from within a zip'ive.  Say you just created an archive for a
program, with all of its docs and auxiliary files.  Now all of a sudden a
new version of the archived program appears on GEnie the next day, in the
form of a new executable and readme file.  Rather than starting from
scratch, you could quickly delete the old program and doc file from the
left hand file selector and replace these with the new ones in nothing
flat.  Also, you can delete files from the right hand file selector.

     Remember that since ST Zip runs in a window now, you can access desk
accessories and drag the window about, which is handy if you're using a
large screen monitor.  A click on the close box accomplishes the same as
the "Quit" button.  Although putting ST Zip into a window seems to prevent
Formdoit from working on the main screen's buttons, I've now automated many
repetitious tasks via Codekeys (demo file #16609).

     As mentioned in my earlier writeup of ST Zip 2.0, don't underestimate
the power of the Display option.  Double-click on a filename in either file
selector, click on the "Display" button and the file is extracted to a GEM
window with a fairly powerful set of viewing options, especially for an
archiver.  A click of either mouse button or the Help key shows you the
available commands.  You can activate them by clicking on the appropriate
one with the mouse or by the keyboard equivalent.

     A new feature for ST Zip is the ability to extract all the files in an
archive to a folder, the first 8 characters of the archive name being used
for the folder name.  Click on the "Config" button and select the "Extract
FFF.ZIP..." button to activate this feature.  (YES! :) -ed.)

     Here's a little trick I learned for highlighting all of the files in
ST Zip's file selectors.  It sounds sort of weird, but it works.  Position
the mouse pointer right above the first file or folder displayed, but below
the title bar.  Click the left mouse button and while still holding it
down, begin to move it downwards.  You'll notice the first file/folder will
inverse as the mouse pointer moves over it.  When you get the mouse pointer
to the last file/folder in the selector, release the left mouse button.
Now all the files will suddenly highlight themselves.  To deselect all
files, click on the words "Select" below the corresponding file selector.

     If you want to archive all of the files showing in the right file
selector, just click on the "Compress" button and after asking you if this
is what you want, ST Zip will archive all of them.  Ditto if you want to
extract all of the files in the left file selector without bothering to
select them all.

     If you click on the words "Total Bytes", it will flip between the
source and destination paths, showing you how many bytes are used by the
currently highlighted files.  There are little arrows to let you know which
directory is being referenced.  One thing I keep forgetting to notice is
the free space display down in the lower right hand corner, for the current
drive.

     The extraction routine has been speeded up in the self extracting
files created by ZIP2TOS.  This is a real boon since, to my knowledge,
there is no available utility to create self extracting files with the LH5
lzh format.  So for the smallest sfx files, use ST Zip 2.1.

     And finally, click on the ST Zip 2.1 logo at the top for a message
from the author.

     In summary, ST Zip is a great archiver for several reasons.  It has  a
GEM-based interface that is easy to understand.  It achieves results
comparable to LH5 lzh compression, sometimes doing better in less time.
You can create self extracting files from its archives, which are easy for
first timers to use.  And if you're archiving ASCII text in particular, ST
Zip is clearly the best, creating the smallest archives in far less time.

                               [*][*][*]


FROM THE AUTHOR   STZip is a program that allows you to compress and
"""""""""""""""   decompress files, i.e.  to reduce their lengths. You
saves space on your disks and reduce the transmission time if you send the
files by modem. It also allows you to group several files in one single
file, whose extension in general is ZIP.

     STZip uses files that are compatible with PKZip 1.93 on the IBM PC,
and the Unix Info-Zip programs Zip 1.9/Unzip 5.2. It will probably be
compatible with the up-coming version 2.0 of PKZIP.

                               [*][*][*]


MINI_BYTE BY RICHARD [97]   Vincent Pomey's STZip 2.1, file #27231 proves
"""""""""""""""""""""""""   itself a worthy addition to ST archiving
utilities.  Its foremost attraction - speed, which seems much faster than
Quester LZH in both compression and decompression.  In my tests,
compressing multiple text, and then multiple graphics files, the resultant
comparisons showed Quester LZH leading in graphics, and STZip leading in
text compression.  The overall difference was never greater than a few
percent in either case.  However, due to its excellent GEM interface, ease
of use, great speed, and IBM ZIP compatibility, STZip would be a boon to
any user.  It rates a solid 97 on our scale of 100.


MINI_BYTE BY TERRY [95]   STZIP Version 2.1 - - A better mousetrap from 
"""""""""""""""""""""""   France.  This program is the latest version of a
native ST "zip" archiver from Vincent Pomey in France.  It is unique among
PD/shareware programs of this type in that it sports both a full GEM
interface as well as a command line interface.  As far as this reviewer can
tell, it is fully compatible with PKZIP 204C for MS/DOS machines (at least
it works with QWK mail packets) only most non-power user types would kill
for a "zipper" that is this easy to use.  If you have TOS 1.4 or greater,
you can install it as an application with the extension "zip" and it will
work slicker and easier than any archiving program you will ever see.

     How well does it work?  Well in benchmarking this one, a text file
that started out at 282608 bytes compressed down to 97570 bytes (for those
of you trying to figure this out, that works out to 35% of its original
size).  By comparison,the best ARC could do was 150792 bytes (53% of
original size) and a LH1 (LZH)archive came out to be 119452 bytes (42% of
original size).  In addition, it was significantly faster than using either
of these other compression methods.

     In conclusion, for being more efficient than any previous archiver
and easier to use besides, I would rate this one a solid 95 (out of 100).
When you consider the fact that all Vincent asks of users is to send him a
postcard, I would encourage everybody use it and send him a postcard to
register it.


MINI_BYTE BY JOHN [97]   First there was ARC, then LZH, now ZIP archivers
""""""""""""""""""""""   have appeared on the scene, and ST ZIP is the
easiest to use and is more full featured of _any_ of the archivers
available for the ST, bar none!  Plus the ZIP method of archiving is faster
and more compact than any of the old standbys!

     For those of us who wish to add comments to an archive it is a snap
using ST Zip.  You can comment the entire archive (up to 390 characters)
and comment each individual file (up to 65 characters) in a archive.  I've
found this to be a wonderful feature (and is great to add mini 'read me'
instructions to an archive).

     The program allows you to configure four algorithms for compacting

                "A Whole Buncha Milliseconds with Mark"
                           by Mark Quinn, DOA
                         GEnie address:  NEWSIE

                        "Virtual Reality Check"

     Most of us have heard about, seen, or even partaken of today's crude
"goggles and gloves" brand of virtual reality.  The attraction and benefits
of the many-generations-removed grandson of such a technology are obvious,
especially at a time when ads for laser disc players proclaim that the
medium is "60% closer to reality", and during the year that Congress is due
to make a decision on which brand of HDTV (High Definition Television)
we'll all be drooling over in the closing years of this century.

     The "goggles and gloves" forays into VR seem almost laughable when
compared to visions concocted by futurists and science fiction writers.  No
one knows what shape tomorrow's VR will take.  Speculations of VR couches
complete with Medusa-like helmets, or biochip interfaces, or simple
headsets are nice, but are merely icing on the VR cake:  the importance of
VR lies in its applications.

     So here are some of the obvious and the not-so-obvious applications
for virtual reality that occur to this tech-crazed modem monkey.

      1)  Medicine.  How about training interns on virtual
          patients instead of real ones?  Or teaching someone who
          has recently broken a leg how to walk on crutches?  Or
          spurring the memories of an amnesiac?  Or bringing out
          the true personality of someone with split
          personalities?  Listening to white noise in the
          background is comforting, but how about _actually
          being_ in a picturesque setting for as many hours as it
          takes the hurt to disappear?  How about letting a
          paraplegic have the experience of climbing a virtual
          Mount Everest?  Letting a (however base and hackneyed
          it sounds) neutered person have a universe-shattering
          orgasm?  How about having people relive experiences in
          their lives in a _positive_ way -- actually going back
          to childhood and stifling that mouthy person or bully?

      2)  Education.  It is said that experience is the best
          teacher, and virtual reality ought to be at least
          second best.  Virtual reality field trips could range
          farther afield than any mundane one.  Students could
          descend miles into the earth, and leap light years into
          space while in the comfort of a virtual reality
          classroom.  Students flying in a VR spaceship could see
          relativistic physics at work, witness the birth of our
          galaxy, and preview its eventual demise.  Or they could
          wing above a Jurassic landscape on the backs of
          pterodactyls, phone home on a re-creation of the set
          of _E.T._ to see how movies of our time were made, or
          peek over Segovia's sheet music as he sight-reads
          _Estudio Sin Luz_.

      3)  Military.  Entire battles could be planned in virtual
          reality.  It's raining brickbats, the terrain is
          muddy/rocky, the enemy is approaching from the east,
          your men are fatigued -- don't kiss your corporal
          goodbye, mister, DO something!

     I might as well stop here.  What I'd like to leave you with as you're
reading this on your screen or from a printout is that the idea is the
important thing.  First comes the idea, then the hardware, then the
applications for that hardware.  (So we're leap-frogging the middle step?
Who knew?)  You've undoubtedly thought of other uses for virtual reality,
too.  Uses which are as varied as virtual reality promises to be.  And I
hope I've (very quickly) outlined some you haven't thought of.

     What intrigues me so much about cyberspace/virtual reality is not how
it will take us where we will go, but what we will do when we get there.

Atari And You

                    >>> LISTEN TO THE DIFFERENCE <<<
                    """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
                        ~ Count Your Blessings ~
 
LISTEN UP!   As one who works in the motion picture industry, years ago I
""""""""""   was immediately drawn to Atari as the "power without the
price" solution to my computing needs. Every once in a while, other things
remind me just how right my decision was to go for and stick with the Atari
line.
 
     In the movie business, inclusive of the once tiny, but now dominant
video arena, all manner of audiovisual equipment eventually passes before
your eyes and ears.
 
     Many years ago, I became interested in planar speaker systems for my
personal use, and settled on the Magnepan line, one of the very first
manufacturers of these amazing eighth inch audio delights. That's right,
1/8 inch thick, but even their smallest speaker stands fully five feet tall
by about two feet wide. I'm still an advocate of their audio quality with a
fervor not unlike that with which I promote and defend the Atari computer
line.
 
     But just like Atari faced the improving IBM lot, my little ol'
Magneplanars had to endure the coming electrostatic marvels and other
companies attempting the planar approach.
 
     However, not until today did I get to personally test my stubborn
support.
 
     A producer friend was closing down an office, and wound up at my door
with a massive pair of Highland Audio Aria speakers. No place to put the
five thousand dollar monsters, so, would I be so kind as to store them...
 
     Slightly intrigued but fully aware I'd have to stow the Magneplanars
to make room (luckily, they store with a footprint of about two feet by
four inches).
 
     So, I stowed them away, placing the magnificent, but oppressively
black Arias in their place. Well, they do have wood trim on the sides, but
the 30 inches by about five feet of black, well, that's oppressive in all
but the Marquis de Sade's house. Or maybe Joe Gideon's (as played by Roy
Scheider in Bob Fosse's _All That Jazz_).
 
     Now, Aria speakers have inch long spikes for feet. Oddly, all black
and spikes, it feels like inviting a military dictatorship into your room.
Or the monolith from _2001: A Space Odyssey_.
 
     The real test, and the point of this story, was in plugging it in and
giving a listen. All other variables equal, these multi thousand dollar
gems need a bunch of polishing. Swallowed midrange. Midrange, that place
where most things musically interesting, like vocalists, live.  So, the
speakers, I hope, will be leaving soon. Ten times the price of my ancient,
"antiquated" Magneplanars, and one-tenth the sound.
 
     Which brings up the Atari issue.
 
     Every day, I am barraged by various people who tell me that bliss
lies with the purchase of a 486 66 megahertz DOS clone with a $400-$500
video board running at 50,000,000 'winflops' or something like that.
 
Will such a machine:
 
     o improve my GEnie online time?
      -- NO. ST Aladdin is far superior to the DOS version.
 
     o improve my word processing?
      -- NO, and I don't even own Calligrapher, or ProText, or
         Le Redacteur - yet.
 
     o improve my desktop publishing?
      -- NO. PageStream still beats all things PC. So does Calamus.
 
     o improve my spreadsheets?
      -- NO on number crunching and sophistication.
      -- YES on WYSIWYG PostScript "pretty" printout.
 
     o improve my graphics?
      -- NO. I have Dave Small's Spectre GCR and Mac's Photoshop.
      -- I also have PageStream.
 
     o improve my productivity?
      -- NO. With CodeHead Technologies' Maxifile linked to
         Charles F.  Johnson's Little Green Selector coupled with
         Multidesk Deluxe and Gribnif's Cardfile, I have more
         desk accessory and file management power than many DOS
         users have in total computing power. This is not to
         mention my intercompatible capabilities, able to work
         with all things Macintosh and most files, text or
         graphics, from the DOS world with ease.
 
     o improve my hardware choices?
      -- NO. My Atari offers unbeatable output to the Deskjet,
         Bubblejet, Dot Matrix, PostScript and Imagesetters I own
         or use. Including my associates, we have optical,
         Syquest, Quantum, and other hard drives running on
         Ataris, flatbed and hand scanners, fax modems, and
         again, cross compatibility with files from the various
         and sundry PC, Mac, and Amiga machines that cross our
         paths. Aside from larger mass storage devices, and more
         megs of RAM for the TT, I can't imagine anything I need
         to add to my three Atari systems.
 
     o improve my screen display?
      -- NO. For nearly the price of a 1040 STe, I can get a
         true color capable graphics card for a DOS PC that means
         business. If only the appropriate monitor for such a
         graphics card were less than $2,000. However, there are
         a variety of add-on graphics cards for the Atari which
         allow similar performance, including Gribnif's import of
         Crazy Dots, a European solution endorsed by the Calamus
         people.
 
     o improve my ease of use?
      -- NO. In all but the most pricey DOS clones, "Windows" is
         a joke foisted on PC users. Slow, poorly designed,
         cumbersome, and anything but slick.And that's after
         having used it, folks, not looking at it. Sort of the
         "command line prompt" of windowed environments, even on
         a really fast machine delivering acceptable redraws.
         Furthermore, when I see a computer literate person
         spending six hours on the phone with the company that
         programmed his multi-thousand dollar super duper video
         graphics package, all in the quest to access extended
         memory...
 
     The Mac crowd is running a cute ad on television showing a couple of
well meaning company men trying to set up a DOS machine to make it more
productive. A passing secretary jabs the barb - by the time their ready,
they'll be out of business.
 
     Atarians benefit by a windowed environment that has always been more
than respectfully fast and efficient. With the excellence of Codehead and
other products, Ataris become machines that vastly outperform its Mac and
DOS cousins. Macs have the interface, but lack good file handling, a
symptom further evidenced by the "balloon help" option within the "new"
System 7. If it were so simple to use, why waste so much effort and memory
to explain it?
 
     DOS users have to resort to Microsoft's Windows, a program that is no
picnic and clumsy at best. Obviously, the semi graphical interface within
Windows somewhat improves the manual command line, and brings programs that
must have windows into the fore. I've seen some nice things, but still, the
slickest offerings in the DOS world abandon Microsoft in favor of their own
custom windowed interface. Further evidencing this division, soon, a new
windowed environment will be offered to DOS users, with supposedly far
greater capabilities, but at the price of gigantic size: beta versions
sucking up some 60-70 megabytes of hard disk space.
 
     Which brings us to the Atari and GEM. It works. Always has. And it
will soon multitask. It is also very, very user friendly and fast, even on
the "antiquated" 68000 microprocessor.
 
     So as I try to unload the Aria speakers which have robbed me of good
music, I think I'll stick to my Ataris which have yet to rob me of anything
at all.

WHAT IT IS   Grocery Lister is a household utility program that allows you
""""""""""   to compile a list of grocery items complete with current price
and total estimated cost.
 
WHAT IT DOES   The Grocery Lister can be used to determine approximately
""""""""""""   how much you will spend at the store if you know the items
that you need.  It can also be used as a budget tool to allow you to select
the items you most need or want if you only have a fixed amount to spend.
With a small amount of database maintenance work each time you buy
groceries you will be able to maintain a fairly accurate file of the items
which you regularly purchase.  This file can be very useful to remind you
of items which you may need as you compile your grocery list.  Finally, for
those who have 'errand boys' do the shopping, the Grocery Lister will
generate a very neat and easy to read printout of the current grocery list.

  PD_Q RATING   3 Lamps
  """"""""""" 
DOCUMENTATION   GOOD
""""""""""""" 
PD_Q COMMENTS   Grocery Lister is a very easy program to use.  It provides
"""""""""""""   an easy way to create not only an easily readable list, but
also one which provides a cost estimate.

     Grocery Lister has two scrolling windows.  One for the master grocery
list which contains all the products you can choose from and their price.
The other is for the list to go shopping with.  The shopping list shows the
item in either selected order or sorted alphabetical order with the item
price.  The shopping list also lists the quantity of the item with a
maximum of 9.  A very convenient feature is the ability to press any letter
and have the master list move to items beginning with that letter.

     The master list can have items added, deleted or item price changed.
The master list and shopping list can be saved.  You can even have
different lists for each store.  Besides printing the shopping list, you
can also print the entire master list.

     The only problem I found with Grocery Lister is a sluggish mouse click
response when selecting items.  Two enhancements I would like to see would
be a place for listing the row where the item is found so the list might be
sorted by row number making shopping more efficient.  The other would be
providing a page break when printing the list or even double column
printing to make better use of paper.

     Grocery Lister provides a great way of knowing how much that next
shopping trip will cost you, provides a reminder of the items you regularly
shop for and helps prevent missing those often forgotten necessities.  The
author is actively seeking user comments for future updates which should
make this an ever improving program.  Definitely worth a hard look.

Thinking About Online Communications

     >>> APPROACHING A MORE PERFECT STATE OF HUMAN COMMUNICAION <<<
     """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
                               ~ Part I ~
 
COMMUNICATION BARRIERS   Have you ever stopped to consider the many types
""""""""""""""""""""""   of barriers that exist in human communication?
Some barriers are barriers of cost.  Some are barriers of inconvenience.
And some are barriers of time delay.
 
     It's interesting to take a closer look at these barriers to see how
online communication helps eliminate or minimize them.
 
 
The Barrier of Cost   The barrier of cost takes on two principal forms:
"""""""""""""""""""
 
          1) The cost of transmission, and,
 
          2) The cost of production.
 
     The cost of transmission usually involves first class or second class
postage costs.  And the cost of production usually involves editing costs,
page-layout costs, printing costs, and paper costs.

     Online communications radically minimizes both transmission costs and
production costs.  In some cases the transmission costs of sending ASCII
text can amount to a small fraction of the cost of sending the same text
via the postal service.  This is especially true if people take full
advantage of flat-rate electronic mail.
 
     Of all the many barriers, the barrier of production costs is the one
that most severely restricts useful information from passing between human
beings.  The restrictive barrier of production costs was recently brought
to mind in a very personal way.  Just last week a national magazine sent my
software publishing company a strongly favorable, but extremely brief,
review of my company's new educational software product.

     Despite the positive tone of this review, I could not help but be
disappointed about the brief length of review.  One can only speculate that
their production and transmission costs were so exceedingly high that they
had to condense each of their reviews to the absolute minimum number of
words.  Another consideration could be that they wanted to give equal space
to fifteen or twenty new software products.  The only way to be fair-handed
would be to give short shrift to each product.
 
     Had this same publication been published online, the production and
transmission costs would be a fraction of their current costs.  The editors
of the publication would then have no problem in "printing" complete and
informative reviews of new educational software products.  The beneficiary
of such improved communication would include not only the software
publishers (who might benefit from increased sales), but also the teachers
and students who ended up using the software.  In a very real sense,
society as a whole benefits from the opening of improved communication
channels.
 
     Another example of the barrier of production costs can be seen in
newspaper classified ads.  Whether it be employment, for-sale, or housing
classifieds, the content is almost always boiled down to twenty five or
thirty words, with each word so radically abbreviated as to constitute a
veritable dialect of the English language.  (This "dialect" was charmingly
spoofed in the 1960's dramatic play titled: "4 RMS, RVR VU," about two
people who meet while searching for a four-room apartment with a river
view.)
 
     Imagine if each classified fully and completely described the job
available, the merchandise for sale, or the housing situation offered.
People could actually browse the classified with a reasonable chance of
finding something that meets their needs.  Currently, newspaper classifieds
can only give you an inkling of the opportunity expressed by the
classified.
 
     Online communication does not place such rigorous limits on the length
of "classified" communications.  On both local bulletin boards and national
information services classified notices often run to several hundred words
in length.  Luxuriating in the available space, persons selling second-hand
computers have been known to list all two hundred titles of software
accompanying the computer.  Buyers, likewise, can luxuriate in knowing the
complete details of the computer system they are purchasing.
 
  
The Barrier of Inconvenience   The second barrier to human communication,
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   the barrier of inconvenience, is not as
obviously pernicious as the barrier of production costs.  Yet this barrier
remains doggedly irksome.
 
     A prime example of such inconvenience is the game of telephone tag.
Nobody but the most persistent person would continue the game of telephone
tag past the first few missed connections.  Even when substantial benefits
could be gained on both sides, few persons have the resolve and tenacity to
continue playing telephone tag for more than a few days.
 
     A second example of inconvenience is the trip to the post office that
is required each time you need more postage stamps.  Next time you're
standing behind ten other people at the post office, take a moment to
consider the heavy burden of the "barrier of inconvenience."
 
     A third barrier of inconvenience is the time-consuming chore of
affixing an address and postage stamp to your postal correspondence.  (Not
to mention the chore of printing out, signing, and folding each letter you
send.)
 
     Online communications almost totally eliminates the barrier of
inconvenience.  E-mail makes telephone tag history (or at least more
bearable.)  You'll never run out of postage stamps when sending electronic
mail.  And you can bypass the "envelope game" entirely.
 
  
The Barrier of Time Delay   A third barrier to human communications is the
"""""""""""""""""""""""""   barrier of time delay.  If it takes too long
for communications to travel back and forth, the rhythm of human
communication is seriously disrupted.  The example that immediately comes
to mind is the interminable delays of sending and receiving mail between
the United States and Canada.
 
     It's not unusual for an air mail letter to take ten days to travel
between the United States and Canada.  That means that an ongoing postal
correspondence between the United States and Canada would yield a maximum
of two interchanges of letters in any given month.  It is amazing our two
countries have remained such good trading partners given such slow-motion
postal exchanges.
 
     A second example of the time delay barrier is overseas correspondence.
An air-mail letter traveling between Washington D.C. and Moscow takes about
two weeks to be delivered.  Interestingly enough, the letter actually
travels to Moscow in less than three days.  It takes the Moscow postal
authorities about ten days to sort and deliver their local mail.
 
     Such time delays degrade the natural rhythm of human communication.
If you sent a letter on the first of the month, would you even remember
what you wrote when you received a reply on the 31st?
 
 
Conclusion   As each of the above-described communication barriers is
""""""""""   eliminated or minimized, communication between human beings
flows smoother and faster.  And history has repeatedly revealed that the
forward progress of civilization is directly proportional to the quantity
and quality of communication taking place.

     Businesses grow through communication.  Children learn through
communication.  Social fabric is formed through communication between human
beings.  Improved communications yields rippled benefits that extend far
out in all directions.

FILES, FILES FILES!   Another busy month of uploads for GEnie's ST

Aladdin's file library .dat file can help you to get more out of ST
Aladdin.  Many new versions of popular programs/demos were uploaded such as
the Calligrapher 3 demo, GEMview 2.13, Silkmouse 3.0, ST Zip 2.1, Payroll
Expert 2.1, B/STAT 2.44 are a few.  And a Connections file was uploaded
that examines the Space Shuttle.  Enjoy!

     Any comments of my own are shown within double asterisks "**...**"
after the file description, in the ASCII GEnie Lamp version, and also in
italics in the TX2 version.  (If you haven't experienced reading the Lamp
in TX2 format, why not download the TX2 file viewer (file #20441) by David
Holmes?  You may be surprised at the versatility and power of this program,
above and beyond viewing TX2 Lamp issues.)

'Universal' Power Supplies   The Power supplies for the MegaSTE, TT, STacy,

supply will be a 110v unit for North America.  (B.REHBOCK, CAT14, TOP22,

Falcon Bundles   We have not committed to bundling Atari Works with
""""""""""""""   Falcon030, but as Atari Work's product manager, I'd
naturally like to see it bundled :-)

     All of the software that does come with Falcon _is_ pre-installed on
the harddisk, ready-to-run.  Unlike the Macintosh Performa, we also include
back-up floppies of everything, too.

     We do intend to upgrade Atari Works as time goes on.  Sam has already
agreed to letting me do a free (postage and handling) upgrade when we
finish the telecommunications module.  It did originally have one, but it
was too weak in by opinion. I want to make sure it has X, Y, and Z-modem so
that it is fully useful.

     If users think a language would be a useful thing to be bundled with
Falcon, please send me e-mail saying so.  I need to persuade the marketing
people.  :-)         (B.REHBOCK, CAT14, TOP41, MSG:9/M475)

GEmail Software Catalog Orders!   Simply e-mail your order to G.LABREC,

Falcon Video Solutions   One of the great things about Falcon is the fact 
"""""""""""""""""""""""   that unlike the Mac or PC, no expensive composite
solution is needed.  Atari is manufacturing an adapter block similar to the
VGA and ST blocks that will be available.  The block has two RCA connectors
on it, the yellow supplies composite video and the white has a left and
right mix-down of the stereo output of the sound system.

     It is set up so that people can get their animations and graphics, in
living color, completely overscanned out to video tape as easily as
possible. In Europe, we will have a Peritel/SCART cable available to do the
equivalent video stuff over there :-)

Atari Media Product Placements   It looks as if there is some dissension
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   about whether or not the Fuji or name
Atari was prominently shown...which tells me that if it was, it was a
fleeting moment.  :)  As others have indicated, there are other spots where
our products have shown up, like The Arsenio Hall Show.  I was up late last
night watching a "Year in Rock" program on MTV. During the presentation,
they dwelled for a while on Black Rappers/The LA Riots. At the point they
were interviewing one set of artists, an Atari Mega ST & Atari Monitor were
clearly visible in their studio.

     The ATARI name on the Stacy was especially made for the unit on
Arsenio's show. No other machine has that sign on it. There are limits on
this kind of stuff...some of it a sort of Catch-22. If the Stacy was
bigger, we could have a bigger sign on it. :) And we do have an agreement
with them for using the machine, and "credits" with it. In showbiz terms,

camera pans the band, giving strategic looks at the nameplates on the
equipment. Some of it is ours, lots of it isn't.

There have been a number of movies over the years, including Blade Runner,
and another movie who's name escapes me at the moment, a spy kinda thing
with Dabney Coleman in it.

THE PHOTO RT   Hi everybody!  Yep, it's February already.  Can you believe
""""""""""""   it?  Boy, I wish I could build myself a time machine and
relive some of those great moments.  Though I'm not too sure if there were
really _that_ many great moments to relive but it would still be nice.  :-)
We _do_ have the next best thing.  Photographs.  Yes, everyone's talking
about photographs these days, especially since Kodak's unveiling of that
new CD photo stuff.

     Well, guess where I visited this month... Yes, you guessed it.  The
Photo RT!  And what a great place it is!  Some of the best photographs
you'll ever see in your life are in the libraries there.  There are
pictures in all the standard formats available for downloading and viewing
on your computer.  You can also contribute your own pictures to the library
too!  You send your pictures through the mail to the sysop and he'll scan
your photos and put them in the library for free!  Neat, huh?  And if your
into picture taking at all, the Photo BBS is a great place to talk to other
people just like you!  To get there, type PHOTO at any prompt.

     So visit the Photo RT this month and have some fun with pictures!  But
before you do, be sure and solve this month's puzzle.  You want to be hip
by showing everyone you know all the latest buzzwords right? :-) Have fun!

     o   GAMER'S UPDATE: In The Pipeline

          o   SHADOWORLDS: A Science Fiction Role Playing Game



                         >>> GAMER'S UPDATE <<<
                         """"""""""""""""""""""

IN THE PIPELINE   This month there aren't a lot of new games that have been
"""""""""""""""   announced.  There are still quite a large number of
games that are on the way.  The two most interesting to add to our list are
Civilization from Microprose and Bat 2 from UBI soft.  So since I keep
talking about a list here's the list of games that I'm expecting to see in
the next several months.

Arriving within the next 3 months
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
     o Legends of Valour
     o Bat 2
     o Palladin II
     o Frontier - Elite II
     o Daemons Gate
     o Civilization

Arriving sometime in 93
"""""""""""""""""""""""
     o Ambermoon
     o Realms of Arkania, Vol 1 Blades of Destiny

     Civilization is a port of the PC version of the same game.  Basically
this is a "god" type game.  You start off with a small tribe of primitives
in the stone age.  You then have to develop villages, towns, cities,
technologies, societies, and of course defeat all encroaching competing
societies.  This game spans from 4000BC all the way through the future.
Wow!  Now you get to redo the world right. :)  As you play the game you
will even meet major historical figures.  I guess that makes this game
educational.  Shouldn't be hard to justify buying since it's going to teach
you something.  Now if only my wife will buy that line...

     The other game that is coming out soon is a Science Fiction Role
Playing game called Bat 2.  This game puts you in the role of a Bureau of
Astral Troubleshooters (BAT) Agent.  In this game a nasty corporation,
Koshan, has taken over the whole solar system of Shedishan.  Seems the key
to this control is the ownership of the planet Bedhin which is the source
of a valuable mineral, Echiatone 21.  It also appears that the ownership of
the planet Bedhin is somewhat in doubt.  So, as the BAT agent, all you have
to do is rescue Shedishan from the nasty corporation.

     The game is going to be very large containing a large number of places
to go and people to talk to.  The graphics will be to be great but
unfortunately the game play interface isn't going to be very good.  If
you've played BAT 1, then BAT 2 is supposed to be better.



                          >>> SHADOWORLDS <<<
                          """""""""""""""""""

ShadoWorlds   Ok, enough discussion of things to be.  Let's get to what
"""""""""""   is!  Just recently ShadoWorlds was released in the US.  The
game ShadoWorlds is by Krisalis Software.  To play ShadoWorlds requires an
ST or STE with 1 MB of memory and a color monitor.  The game comes on two
720KB floppies.  Included in the package were two 720KB floppies, one
instruction booklet and one novella.

     ShadoWorlds takes place in the distant future on the remote solar
system of Magna 6 a galaxy-class space station which has been setup to
conduct research on the most powerful weapons the universe has ever known.
For two months there has been no contact with the station.  Naturally, the
rest of the know galaxy is getting a bit concerned about the status of this
station and all it's high tech weapons.

     A team needs to be put together to investigate the station.  This team
is to be composed of four individuals that need to be trusted and
expendable.  Your team of four characters board there ship and enter
cryogenic sleep for the 17 month trip to Magna 6.  When they awaken they
are at the station and the adventure begins.  Your mission is to explore
the station and the other planets in the system and find out what went
wrong.

     You are in a dark hallway on the spacestation.  There is a light
illuminating a door at the end of the hallway.  Your party stands in
complete darkness.  You turn on your suit light to shine its light around
the hallway and you spot a pistol...


Game Play   You start the game by selecting your four characters from a
"""""""""   list of characters.  The various characters are displayed as
portraits complete with stats, historical information and special
abilities.  Stats displayed are Strength, Health, Combat skill, and Tech
skill.  The characters range from bloodthirsty criminals to psychic aliens
- a good collection of expendable characters.  After you've selected the
four characters game play begins.

     Your party starts in an outer hallway of the spacestation.  The screen
layout is split into two parts.  The lower part of the screen displays five
squares.  The two squares on the left and two squares on the right are
character portraits that display the your characters portrait in a space
helmet.  Also displayed in the portraits are what you are carrying in the
both your left and right hands.  Finally, there is a colored bar that
indicates your health points.  In the center of these portraits is the
central control character (CCC).
  
     The CCC is picture of a characters arms, legs and head and is used to
control your characters.  When you click on one of the portraits the color
of the CCC changes to match the character selected and the microphone in
the character portrait's space suit lowers to his mouth.  Commands are
issued by clicking on different body parts displayed in the CCC.

     The upper 2/3 of the screen displays the game area in which the view
is in the 3D isometric style (as in the popular games Legend and Hero
Quest).  All action in the game is real time - so as you stand around
waiting robots may come after you or shoot at you.  Clicking the right
button in the game area of the screen will center the screen on you
characters.  This centering occurs automatically as you move but it happens
in jumps.  Sometimes you need to be in the center to see what's ahead
before moving.

     Clicking on various parts of the CCC makes the selected character do
an action.  For example, you can have him or her read the computer displays
that are scattered about.  As you move around there are screens which set
up high on some of the walls.  These are the computer screens that you can
read, not the actual computer terminals that you find scattered around.
Reading these displays will display critical information.

     Another action is you can make the character use an object that is in
their hand.  One handy option to use is a gun.  You use the gun and select
a spot or an enemy displayed on the game display to shoot at.

     You can also operate an item or pickup an object.  This is how you
retrieve things that you find laying around.  You also use this command to
refill fluid containers, recharge batteries, and recharge or refill guns.

     Lastly you can have your characters to walk around as a group, as
individuals or in two separate groups.

     If you click the right button in the character portrait area the
screen switches to the inventory screen.  In this screen you can see all
of your character current status.  There are 4 bar charts displaying the
health, strength, fluids level and overall battery power.  There is also an
eye and iv icon displayed for each character.  Clicking on the eye puts
that character to sleep.  The IV is used to connect fluid bags
intravenously.  These bags can increase your fluid level or special ones
can heal you.  There are also two areas to define team formations.  You can
use the team formation area to define two independent teams.  Teams can
move together and stand in defined formations.  Also on the inventory
screen you can click on items found and a short message is displayed
describing the object and its charge level.  Characters that are standing
next to each other can have their items exchanged between them.  The
inventory screen is also where you load and save games.  Saving the game
requires one blank floppy.

     One of the nice features of this game system is that all the
characters are multitasking.  This means that you can tell one character to
walk somewhere while another character is shooting a nasty critter and the
last character is pushing a button.  


The Photoscape   Another big aspect of the game is the clever use of light
""""""""""""""   and dark.  This characteristic is call the photoscape.
You will find many uses for light.  Early in the game you learn that you
need light to spot the details of special objects.  First using flares or
your helmet light you can create light to view your surroundings.  The
flares create a circle of light around that character who is using the
flare.  As the flare burns down the circle of light shrinks and finally
goes out.  The helmet light is more of a directional light.  Using the
mouse you an aim the beam of light at a specific point.  As your character
moves the light moves with him.  Eventually, the light's battery burns
down the light gets dimmer.  Remember to collect batteries!

     Besides vision, light has other effects as well.  It is important to
experiment with lights to see what impacts they have on your environment.
For example, lights can make certain doors open or close, some robot's
responses are varied based on the light and sometimes when you have your
flare lit the robots can't see you.  Extinguish the flares and the robots
will come straight for you!

     As you explore the Photoscape you will discover several important
objects.  You will discover chests hidden in the darkness.  Chests when
held in a hand will display 6 container slots for objects.  You will also
find recharge points for batteries or weapons.  These chargers only work
once.  There are also fluid dispensers that can be used to refill fluid
bags.  There isn't a limit to the number of refills.


Combat   As you explore the station you will find a variety of weapons,
""""""   many of which come in two parts, the weapon and the barrel.
This is important as different combinations of weapons and barrels have
different affects on the operation of the weapon.  As you travel you will
find recharge points for weapons.  Unfortunately, these chargers can only
be used once.

     Combat is a largely a realtime "arcade like" activity.  To be most
effective you will need to coordinate several of your characters attack
strategies.  One character is to lead the bad guys into an ambush where
your other three characters are strategically placed.  Or, one character
could scout ahead while three other characters follow behind.


Exploration   As you explore the space station you will have to solve
"""""""""""   various puzzles dealing with light.  Some puzzles will also
use pressure plates and even others use card keys to operate elevators
or open doors.  As you explore the various rooms you will also encounter
traps and various nasty droids.


So What's The Bottom Line?   This game is very similar to an earlier game
""""""""""""""""""""""""""   called Shadow Lands from Domark.  There are
several area that this game has improved on.  First the control system is
better than the Shadow Lands system and the overall speed of the game
looks like it might be slightly faster.  I also like the missile weapons in
this game.  But as in Shadow Lands if you are too close to the creature
you're shooting you may take damage from the backlash.

     The graphics are good and there have been some improvements in the
operations of the 3D environment since Shadow Lands.  All the images and
functions are clear.   In Shadow Lands you could see what was on the other
side of a wall before you went in - that isn't the case in ShadoWorld.
Unfortunately, there isn't much in the way of sound effects.

     I've found one major bug in the game: In the inventory screen if I
take the bag of fluid to the character portrait and click the game dies
shortly thereafter.  This is a rather strange bug since it only happens
with the fluid.  I'll bet the user interface changed to the IV thing late
and some of the code for putting fluid in the portraits mouth is still
active.   

     The documentation is complete and covers every aspect of the game.
The Novella that is included is a nice touch but I found the storyline
disappointing.  (The Novella concept is a nice idea.  The one in Amberstar
was actually pretty good.)

     The game comes on floppies and is not installable on the hard drive,
Surprisingly, this isn't a problem.  Once the game is booted and running you
don't have touch the floppies unless you want to save.  On the downside,
there is only one save per floppy - I would have preferred the ability to
save several save games on a single floppy.


Final Thoughts...   ShadoWorlds is a good game.  The photoscape provides a
"""""""""""""""""   great atmosphere and adds a new twist to problem
solving.  ShadoWorlds provides a combination of arcade like action, puzzle
solving and role playing all rolled into one.  And although I personally
prefer non-arcade role playing games I still would rate this game highly.
ShadoWorlds is a game worth checking in to!

               >>> HOW TO ADD THIS SCRIPT TO ALADDIN <<<
               """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Installing The Script   First of all, you will need to separate this
"""""""""""""""""""""   script from the magazine.  To do this, just load
this magazine into any word processor or text editor, and cut or block this
script file out to it's own separate file and save it as SCRIPT.TXT.  Place
SCRIPT.TXT into your Aladdin folder.  Your script file will now
automatically load in when you boot up Aladdin.

IMPORTANT!   If you are already running one or more script files, you will
""""""""""   need to append this file to the end of your present
SCRIPT.TXT.  To do this in...


Aladdin IBM
"""""""""""
     o At Aladdin's main menu, call up an available script, or
       overwrite an existing script:

            [F7,A]      -to use an available script entry
            [F7,E,n]    -to edit a script already used
                         (n is the number of the script)

     o Make note of the script number in the script editor.

     o Use CTRL-Y to delete ALL the current text lines in the script
       editor.

     o Use CTRL-K,R to read the script file into the script editor.
       [CTRL-K,R,<filename>,ENTER]

     o Change the # in the line SCRIPT # to reflect the script
       number you've previously noted.

     o ESC to save


ALADDIN ST/AMI
""""""""""""""

     o Under the "File" menu, click on the "Edit User Script" option.
       This will load in your current script file.

     o Position the cursor at the end of your script file.  Now, using the
     "Paste File" option under "Edit" add the new script file.

     o Change the # in the line SCRIPT # to reflect the script number
       you've previously noted.   For example, if you have already
       installed 3 files, the line would like like this:

                   Script 4 Latest 100 News Stories

     o ESC to save
