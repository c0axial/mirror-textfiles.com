   This conference is known as ThrobHelp. It is moderated by Laura &
   Joe Crosby. It has been set so we may answer *ANY* questions that
   you might have pertaining to ThrobNet. Laura and Joe have talked long
   and hard about this conference, and have come up with a few ideas of
   what can be expected in here.

   First off, this area should have it's own set of bulletins, which
   will answer 90% of your questions. If not, simply address a
   question to Joe Crosby or Laura Brito, and we will assist you in
   your search for an answer! If you have a conference proposal, or a
   gripe about a conference (or anything else for that matter), this is
   the place for you to speak your peace. Please do not use this area
   for sextalk, or fantasies.. This is for *HELP* only...
   In addition to help that you might need, the administrators will post
   updates and news about ThrobNet in this conference.
