        Did you know that RelayNet is a major mail network and is
currently offering software companies and shareware authors the
opportunity to join our network, where we will not only relay your own
product support conference but we will also store any and all of your
shareware products and enhancements on our national Network HUB?

        This not only offers users an opportunity to learn about your
products but to also have your programs readily available in a
central location that is accessible to every board in the network.
Already online are Mark Turner, John Friel, Sam Smith, Mark Herring, Don
Parsons, Justin Boyan, Rex Conn, Kip Compton, Semware, Hayes etc.

        We offer each company or shareware author there own conference
or set of conferences, depending on their needs and wishes. No need to
share with others and have your product discussion diluted. We only ask
that you give your usual level of support to the users that your fine
product warrants, so that you can have the recognition your efforts
deserve. This is your chance to reach those that use your product as
well as those who don't but are future customers!

        And we have over 950 ACTIVE boards located in the US, Canada,
Denmark, Holland, Spain, Portugal, Norway, the far east and the Middle
East. More countries (such as Japan and Switzerland) and boards are
being added daily.  We are an evergrowing network, having tripled in
size in the last year alone.  In fact we add about one board per day!
We are no fly by night network, having been relaying successfully and
without interruption for over five years now.

        In addition, we are also always happy to share any of our
support conferences with many of the other networks and have the
facilities and software ability to do that easily.  With our own network
alone we represent 100,000's of potential users of YOUR product. Some
networks may talk about their international flavor and growth, but we
can deliver it!

        The guidelines for us are simple:  You support your shareware
product with regular visits to your conference.  There is no membership
fees, no conference requirements (although you are of course, always
free to take whatever of our conferences interest you) software is
readily obtainable for many different BBS softwares, and we can get you
online is less than 24 hours. Easy enough to have your own product
support conference, from coast to coast, and across the Atlantic and
soon the Pacific Oceans!
