AmateurRadio Net(sm) History
============================
 
As Of: July 1, 1995
 
April 29, 1995
==============

I seem to travel quite a bit lately.. I normally am out during the week..
so if you want me for some administrative reason (Having a problem,
Want to establish a feed, etc.) please send it to me so I have it by 
Saturday morning.. I am normally home by then. I do sometimes go into
the office on Sunday.. So Saturday is a key date to get me.. John


March 19, 1995
==============

We have discontinued the ARN_UN series areas for their real USENET
names. 

We have enabled a Internet Mailing List for HDN, OldRadio and REACT
areas. They are now available via the Internet.


January 7, 1995
===============

This marks the second of what will be monthly updates to the Info Pack.


November 30, 1994
=================

AR-Net now has an Internet E-Mail conference. This will allow you and
your users to send those person to person E-mails. 

Your Internet Address will be first.last@ar-net.woodybbs.com

Sometime in 1995, we may convert this from an Echo Conference to routed 
netmail via our Zone 599 nodelist. 


November 20, 1994
=================

The strategic aliance with HamNet of Europe is now in place and we are
sharing all of the echo areas between both nets. This aliance allows us
to share Echo areas while allowing the administration to be handled 
separately. 

We are starting to offer our own FIDO Nodelist. This will permit members
who are not members of Fidonet to use FIDO style mail distribution. Our
zone number is 599.


July 4, 1994
============

Another explosive quarter of growth. We have trimmed a few conferences
that weren't working out and replaced them with others.

We have developed a strategic aliance with HamNet of Europe. We are now
gating a few conferences with them.

We have mailed over 100 fliers out to OEM's and Dealers. We had our first
Press Release from an OEM just the other day. We hope that others will 
follow suit and our DEALER conference will become the conference you go 
to for New & Used equipment.


April 3, 1994
=============

The net has grown quite a bit since it's February intro.. We've added a 
few new conferences. Mail traffic is still light in a few conferences..
We seem to be adding more nodes on a weekly basis. 

Our announcement fliers are being created as we speak, we expect to have 
them addressed and mailed by April 30th..

We have open Gates to 2 other networks. This makes it easier for other
systems in areas we don't cover well to gain access to the net.

February 19, 1994
=================

This is the initial release of the AR-Net info pack. AR-Net was created
as a result of the recent folding of an older Amateur Radio Network 
called RF-Net(tm).
