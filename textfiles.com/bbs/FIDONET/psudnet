             -=ð] PseudoNet [ð=-
PseudoNet is a fast growing nationally distributed network created to serve
the crowd that tends to fall between the cracks; the laid-back intellectual.
Too many debate nets are overly structured; too many structureless nets are
filled with hordes of verifiable morons.  <grin>  PseudoNet allows a place
of relaxation and intellectual thought, where no subject or opinion is off
limits.  There are no rules of conduct outside of staying within legal
boundaries and attacking someone personally; it is more prudent and logical
to attack their beliefs, and flames serve no other purpose than to cause
unnecessary tension.  Hubs are now available in seven states from California
to New York.  Join today and enjoy!  [28 Nodes]
