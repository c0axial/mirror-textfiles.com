 Welcome to HoGeNET! HoGeNET is a network of bulletin boards dedicated to
 the exchange of information and the pursuit of fun in an electronic
 medium.  HoGeNET stands for HOmade GEneric Network.  Mainly,
 the reason we did this was that with local message subs, there may be
 a quick boredom factor due to the fact that the same people say the same
 things over and over again.  



          Send this file to James Esteves Aka Homey via HoGeNET () or Andrew
          Lison Aka Ataru via HoGeNET ()  <Once you  incorporate HoGeNET.pvt in your
          nodelist of course> or you could Also Send your App to anyone
          of the HUBs for HoGeNET whichever Hub is closest.  Shouldn't
          take that much longer.  Remember, the more Nodes = Less you will
          have to spend on long distance charges and we all know how those
          can be.

          New Nodelists are put out every First day of the Week (Saturday).
          
                           Thanks for your interest in HoGeNET!
