                      MODERATORS' GUIDELINES
                      ----------------------

Definition - A person who presides over a meeting, assembly, conference,
etc.   (SOURCE - Webster's New World Dictionary)

        A moderator has a very difficult job.  Since they are human,
they have opinions on most subjects as the rest of us do.  However a
moderator must NOT impose his/her opinion on others.  They must try to
remain calm and not expect to get in "the last word".  They also must
show restraint while at the same time try to keep the conference under
control if/when arguments get out of hand.  If the moderator is
unsuccessful in ending a "feud" or solving any dilema, they should then
contact the network administrator(s).  It is in fact preferred to
contact the administrator(s) as soon as the problem arises so that they
can follow along with the progression.

        Also a moderator should try to create some conversation if there
is a lack of participation from users.

        A moderator can post conference rules on a regular basis if they
desire.  Each moderator can make up their own rules in accordance with
their conference topic.

        Some moderators may not like a lot of quoting or long signatures,
but they should NOT tell users to cut back.  If the moderator feels
there's a problem with a particular user(s) he/she should send a message
to the administrator(s).  Please remember, there are NO rules against
having signatures or quoting, but there should be consideration by the
users, moderators, and sysops for others in the network.

        In short, there are only two generic rules for moderators to
enforce.  They are 1. Don't stray off topic & 2. No personal attacks.
