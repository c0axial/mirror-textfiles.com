Questions & Answers:
--------------------
Q.  What happens when I'm a hub for a region??
A.  You will normally get 2 node numbers assigned to you.  In the form of:
    12:???/0 and 12:???/1.  Both these node numbers (replace the ??? with the
    ones assigned to you) will be placed in your FD/IM (etc.) known AKA 
    systems.  You will poll Bodil Harm (12:700/0) for mail, posts should be 
    stamped with 12:???/1 (from your system), and when people poll you for 
    mail, they will poll 12:???/0.  You are responsible for making packets 
    for your nodes that poll you.  Example, say you are 12:700/0 (Bodily 
    Harm), I am responsible for making packets for all my 12:700/? nodes.  
    Hubs are responsbile for polling Bodily Harm (12:700/0) for the mail from
    other systems, it is extremely important that follow rule #3 (poll every 
    24 hours).

Q.  What happens when I'm a node??
A.  You will poll the hub of your region, say you are 700 (east coast), and
    you are node # 12:700/2, you will poll 12:700/0 for mail, just like
    12:600/3 will poll 12:600/0 for mail.  Meaning you should never poll
    someone out of your region (ie: if you are 12:600/3 you should not be
    polling 12:700/0, unless you have worked something out with FusioN and he
    knows about this).  If the hub is down or not making you packets, try to 
    get in touch with him/her.  If the problem continues get in touch with 
    FusioN and he will fix this problem.

Q.  What the hell are with these weird regions (ie: 700, 600, etc.)??
A.  Welp, I've decided the best posible way of organizing a net.  I've 
    eliminated border problems with the north/south/east/west concept (which
    then runs into problems with out of country nodes as well), and the 
    thousand dead hub concept (every 1st board in an area code is a hub, 
    meaning there are more hubs to look after and take care of and the better
    chance of something going wrong).  I've developed the best system yet.
    What I've done is this:  I've divided the regions according to their
    time zones (ah!, so that's it), setting Greenwich, England to 12:00 noon,
    and then going with the standards set by the time zones all across the
    world, leaving enough room for expansion with the most reliable system
    for a net.  That should explain this concept for all of you wondering
    why the hell the node numbers are of something that you're not used to.
