 Welcome to Planet Earth Network, a network which topically discusses the
 wonderful, and sometimes not so perfect, planet on which we live.  Contained
 within this file are the Network Philosphy and Guidelines which Planet Earth
 Administration hopes is read and made readily available to one and all.

 ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
 ³ NETWORK GOALS ³
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
 Planet Earth is an E-Mail Network for articulate and intelligent
 discussions pertaining to the world in which we live.  It is not the goal
 and/or purpose of the Network to preach morality or to denounce any group,
 philosophy or ideology.  Plane Earth is here to LEARN, INFORM, PROMOTE, and
 DISCUSS ideas on how to improve our PLANET: EARTH!  Hopefully, through
 everyones involvement, issues which have an impact on each and everyone of
 us can be brought to the forefront; and change, where needed, can be
 promoted through discussion.

 ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
 ³ DISCLAIMER ³
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
 Planet Earth Network reserves the right to decline any conference requests
 that the PEN administration deems to be in any way "inappropriate in nature,"
 and not related topically to the goals and/or spirit of the Planet Earth
 Network.  If your BBS contains this sort of material or caters to
 "problem users", so be it, it's within your rights to do so, if any member's
 BBS activities or userbase infringes on the spirit of the Planet Earth
 Network, that BBS will be swiftly removed from membership, if that BBS takes
 insufficient action to protect the spirit and image of PEN.  Planet Earth
 Adminstration also reserves the right to change the contents of this
 file as deemed neccessary.

 ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
 ³ User Rules ³
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
 Conference participants are to conduct themselves in a polite, dignified, and
 considerate fashion.  There will be differences of opinion; but, tolerance is
 still the rule.

 Moderators are selected to stimulate discussions as needed; and to keep
 discussions on topic. When a moderator asks that a thread cease or move to a
 more appropriate conference, the participants must comply immediately.
 Flaming, bashing or baiting in any dimension will not be tolerated within PEN.
 There is no ANSI graphics conference, so using ANSI in posts is not permitted.
 Software-specific macros are not allowed since we cater to several BBS types.
 Encryption of posts for any reason are grounds for immediate removal from PEN.
 Messages may not be cross-posted, gated or made available to any non-PEN BBS.
 "Obvious aliases" are *NOT* permitted for use within any of PEN's conference.
 Signatures may not be more than (3) lines or (80) characters or spaces at most.
 Taglines may not be more than (1) line and (79) characters or spaces at most.
 Quoting must be limited to only what is necessary for proper train of thought.
 Elaborate quoting utilities (Fancy boxes, dates/times etc) are not permitted.

 ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
 ³ Private Messages ³
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
 Pursuant to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, 18 USC 2510
 et. seq., all Sysops and users participating within PEN, must be aware that
 there are no facilities provided by PEN for sending/receiving confidential
 electronic communications.  Although PEN maintains the capability and capacity
 to send/receive mail, which is flagged as "Receiver-Only", mail so flagged is
 *not* to be considered by any user as actual private messages.  The purpose of
 "Receiver-Only" mail is intended only to provide means to limit the possible
 number of users that may have access to the mail for display purposes.  Every
 message entered into all PEN conferences become the property of Planet Earth
 Network unless the author posts an explicit copyrighted notice in the message.

 ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
 ³ Sysop Rules ³
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
 PE-NetAdmin Conference mail must be read at a minimum of YA or as addressed
 to YOU, PERSONAL, to ALL.  Failure to respond to personal mail is reason for
 removal from PEN. General announcements from the network administration are
 addressed to ALL in the PE-NetAdmin conference and will be kept to a minimum.
 Any PEN member Sysop who is asked to remove the access of a user must do so
 immediately and failure to do so can result in the removal of the BBS itself.
 PEN Sysops may never "edit" any mail relayed via PEN, including any form of
 manual modification or with the use of any utility to do so  automatically.
 PEN Hub Sysops must relay mail every day and must carry all 22 conferences.
 PEN Hub Sysops have the authority to remove the access of one or more of its
 nodes should problems exist, such as duplicates, script bombs, etc.  A note
 to Gary Inman or Bruce Vigil in PE-NetAdmin is necessary if this action is
 taken, but Hub Sysops do NOT need administrative approval first, to take such
 action.  PEN Hub Sysops must forward completed applications to the PEN Host
 BBS via our private Regionals conference or via a RoseNet message.  All Planet
 Earth Net taglines must begin with either of these: ş PEN ş or ş Planet Earth ş
 with your choice of delimiting characters.  S/R's or Hub are encouraged to
 indicate such status in their taglines.

 ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
 ³ Becoming a PEN Hub ³
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
 To be any level of hub for PEN your BBS must meet some minimum criteria, such
 as:

  1) not using sluggish "XT" computers
  2) plenty of hard disk space
  3) the availability of time for Hubs or Nodes to access your system
  4) that you do not charge any Hubs and/or Nodes for the sole purpose of
     accessing PEN, and lastly
  5) High speed modems are required for those systems seeking HUB status and
     and/or exchanging mail directly with the Host system.  All lines on the
     on the HOST support v.32 and v.32bis connection.  Line 2 also supports
     HST 9600/14400 connections.

 PEN is also available for downlink via satellite but replies must still follow
 traditional transfer methods. Information on this is to follow as it becomes
 available. The PE-Regionals conference will NOT be available via satellite due
 to the applications processed through it. PEN is looking for Super-Regionals
 Regionals and Hubs in many areas around the world and a few U.S. areas, so if
 you are interested in hubbing for the Planet Earth Network, and if an opening
 is available in your region, we will give you top priority in getting set up
 with us!  We do not wish to duplicate many areas with multiple SR and Hubs
 though so if you are interested, contact us soon.

 ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
 ³ HUB Responsiblities ³
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

 PEN S/R's, Regionals, and HUBs are charged with the responsibilty of
 approving new member systems. As such, S/R's, Regionals, and HUBs are
 responsible for the systems which they approve.

 If a prospective member system's application is declined, please inform
 Gary Inman, in PEN-Regionals, as to the reason why the prospective
 system was declined for PEN membership.

 ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
 ³ Conference Configs ³
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
 PE-NetAdmin is PEN's Administrative conference and is required to be carried
 by all PEN Sysops. PE-NetAdmin is fully public and must be accessible to all
 users unless Tcan'd. PE-Regionals must be carried by all PEN Super Regionals,
 Regionals or Hubs. Hubs must NEVER give access to PE-Regionals to any Node or
 user relaying through them or calling their BBS. Messages in PE-Regionals must
 never be made public without expressed written permission from the PEN
 administration.

 ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
 ³ BBS/Network Software ³
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
 PEN members must use legally purchased or obtained NETWORK and BBS software as
 defined by the software documentation/licensing agreements. The software which
 is authorized for mail relays within the Planet Earth Network  is as follows:

   PCBoard   - RoseMail/Qnet/Rnet/Cam-Mail
   Wildcat   - Tnet, WcGate
   GAP       - GapQWK
   TriBBS    - TriNet
   Spitfire  - Jnet
   Auntie    - QWiKerNet.
   Sychronet - Synchronet
   UltraBBS  - CNet

 If you are a PCBoard Sysop using RoseMail, we are network number 5 in your RM
 conference setups. So if the BBS software you are using is not listed above,
 it's not authorized for use in the Planet Earth Network. While this may change
 in the future, we currently are not accepting applications from BBS Sysops
 using any software that is not mentioned above.

 ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
 ³ BBS Approval Process ³
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
 Applicants must meet some minimum requirements:

  1) Applicants must be recommended by their proposed hub.
  2) The applicant's BBS must be in operation for 3 months  (minimum)
  3) Only "approved" BBS and/or QWK networking software may be used.
  4) Planet Earth Net Hub Sysops may, at their discretion, ask approved
     applicants for the QWK configuration file to ensure that tags or
     conference assignments are OK

 If the above conditions are met, and your sponsoring HUB approves your
 system, applicants can be relaying with Planet Earth Network in as little as
 24 hours. Applicants may apply at any Planet Earth Network Hub or preferably
 the PEN Hub the applicant wishes to relay through. If your BBS is approved
 for relays with the Planet Earth Network, please *do not* send through more
 than 1 "_________ BBS is now echoing this conference" type message. Only 1
 message is permitted per approved applicant and in our PE-NetAdmin conference
 (only).

 The Planet Earth Network is a free network, but we are "private", not public.
 Sysops are invited to join, but no Sysop has the "right" to membership in PEN.
 Failure to abide by PEN rules will result in the removal of the offending BBS.

 In the advent that your system is declined for PEN membership you can write
 or E-Mail the PEN Administrators at the addresses listed below. Please
 state the HUB through which you applied and the date that you applied.
 PEN Administrations will review you request for Administrative Review and
 hopefully will reply within one week of reciept of your request; allowing
 the Administration time to contact the declining HUB.

 ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
 ³ Conference Moderators ³
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
 Conference Moderators are selected by Bruce Vigil (Co-Administrator) and may
 be removed and/or replaced should a moderator fail to perform their duties as
 outlined below:

  1) Maintain the friendly atmosphere that represents PEN
  2) Assist in the answering of questions relating to the subject of the
     conference to the best of their ability
  3) Read the PE-NetAdmin Conference on a timely basis
  4) Keep posts on topic and/or politely direct off topic users to the
     appropriate conference
  5) Notify the Administration of problems regarding any configuration errors
     such as duplicate messages, cross-echoes, cross-posts etc.

 If a user(s) causes any problems for you:

  1) Issue polite a warning to user(s) failing to follow rules
  2) If a user persists in a manner that you feel warrants suspension, let
     Bruce Vigil or Gary Inman know in PE-NetAdmin and they will review the
     matter

 PEN has an image consisting of good will and friendliness, so if a thread
 develops that is deemed inappropriate, you are to ask that it cease. Users
 who fail to do so will be removed, which is invaluable for ensuring your
 conference maintains its quality image.
