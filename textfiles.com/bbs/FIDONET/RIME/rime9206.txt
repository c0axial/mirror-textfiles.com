1 - FRANKLY, CURT                          From your Editor, Node ID ->MORE
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

     It's open season in Newport.  Memorial Day found us turning our town
over to the tourists, and the tourists turning their hard-earned pennies
over to our town.  It's mostly a peaceful exchange, and we take the town
back after Labor Day with a bit of pocket change to last us the winter.

     Usually quite festive, with the town looking its best, the beginning
of open season also brings with it a certain amount of voyeurism on the
part of the locals, like who's getting married and who's in each of the
recreational vehicles and other things we do to pass the time it takes to
walk rather than drive (a Sherman tank in full battle gear might make it
safe).  The hotels would sport signs saying things like "Congratulations,
Bambi and Sean" and the big homes on wheels would announce "Tina and Bob
from Dispatch, Wyoming," and there they were peering down at us as we
crossed in front of their mobile version of the American dream.  Kinda
personal, kinda nice.

     This year, there's something very wrong.  I pass signs on hotels that
say "Welcome, Newlyweds" and see, not Tina and Bob, but "The Taylors".
It's as I imagine it would be in a supermarket that sold only generic
foods.

     ....which makes me all the more happy to be able to provide for you,
this month, a bit of the warmth of RIME and its folk.  We don't have a
Bambi and Sean that I know of, but we do have Elaine and Howard who threw a
bash that even got Inez Harrison out of the house; she tells us of the
happenings.  We also, I think, don't have a Tina and Bob from Wyoming, but
we have Morten Sillesen from Denmark who is spending 10 weeks enjoying
America because of RIME folk who responded to his queries regarding places
to stay and people to get to know.  Grand fun.

     ....which makes me even all the more happy to welcome a new column to
RIME Times.  I'm convinced that many serious, long-lasting relationships
have been started with nothing more than blinking RD and SD lights on
modems that served to connect, via RIME, two people who would have
otherwise never known each other existed.  Jackie Doty (Node ID ->THEDOCK)
will tell the stories of long-distance relationships, learnings,
friendships, and such, and how they unfolded.

     Enjoy your June.  Enjoy our net.  But most of all, enjoy yourselves.

     Until next month, when I hope to bring you more ramblings from the
world of RIME...

I remain,
Frankly,
Curt

The following was posted on ->MORE at 1:30 a.m., June 4th.
[Editor's Note:  Morten's idioms have been left intact.]

     Finally taking off from Danish soil.  I've been waiting for this
moment in weeks. Seems like a dream comes true, except from saying
goodbye to my fiancee and family.

The Last Plannings...
     The past weeks have been very exciting.  Even though I had the
necessary host-confirmation, there has been a lot of planning to do. The
biggest problem has definitely been when exactly to arrive and departure to
and from the different hosts.  The main reason is that the communication
with one of my hosts (New Orleans) has broken down.  In the beginning he
promised to host me, but later on he suddenly had to do other things.  He
promised to find me another host among his friends, and ended up with
telling me about a guy from his university. But then communication broke
down.  All I could do was to post a 'real' letter to his university (since
I never had his real address) and tell them about the problem.  They've
gotten the phone numbers on the three hosts before New Orleans, and then
maybe they'll call and we can arrange something.  I'm definitely going to
New Orleans 'cause I've to fly from New Orleans to L.A.  Fortunately my
hosts are very flexible, and I might be lucky to avoid staying long in New
Orleans without a local host.

     The best of all the planning has been the increasing interest and
encouragement from my hosts.  Every day there has been at least a couple of
messages from one of them.  I've felt their eagerness rise through the time
of planning, and this has made me feel welcome.

From Dream to Reality...
     That the dream should turn to reality is still not clear to me.  But
it's a fact, and here's a little about it.

     Tuesday, June 2.  I arrived to JFK airport in NYC.  I should meet my
first host, and I was really excited about the whole thing when I sat in
the plane heading towards NYC.  My first host, David Honigsberg, and I had
arranged to meet in the airport.  Unfortunately we missed each other in the
crowd. This way I had my first impression of NYC.

     First I drove around in the neighborhood of David's apartment to get
some cash to pay the cab.  Of course none of the available cash machines
accepted my VISA card, and the one which did said 'out of service'. Finally
we (the cabdriver and I) found a useable machine, and I got some cash to
pay with.  Next problem was that David wasn't returned from the airport
yet.  When I waited outside his apartment, his neighbor invited me to her
apartment, and I talked to her for half an hour. I felt as a totally
stranger in this huge city, but suddenly people began to invite me to their
apartments without knowing me. That's very hospitable!  Finally David
returned from the airport. It was very great to meet him, and, from the
very beginning, I felt welcome and taken care of.

     The next day David showed me a lot of exciting parts of NYC.  I saw
Manhattan from a Staten Island Ferry, the Stock Exchange, Central Park,
and a couple of beautiful cathedrals.  I'm impressed of the city and,
I'm impressed of the never ending hospitality that every body shows
me.  David and I already have tight plans for the next couple of days,
and I know it'll be a great couple of days.  He has also planned a
meeting with some of the local BBS'ers, and I can't wait to meet them.

3 - JACKIE'S BEANSTALK                    By Jackie Doty, Node ID ->THEDOCK
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

     Imagine your modem as fertile ground, and each conference you enter as
one of Jack's magical beans.  Plant a bean, and your beanstalk can take you
into worlds unseen, yet waiting.

     The potential for personal growth is endless.  Choose a subject --
nearly any -- in which you have an interest.  Post a message, and meet with
myriads of people who will share with you, teach you, learn from you...
enhance you.  We peek out with tentative tendrils of thought, patting the
minds of anonymous others.  There are times the tendrils twine, and
friendship is born in a wondrous way never known before.

     For myself, I have made friends across the breadth of the US -- from
Rhode Island to California -- and gleefully touched on Canada, Paris and
parts of the Orient.  I have found talents never explored in depth, and
teachers to help me expand them.  Like Morten, I could easily travel around
the world, paying only for the transportation... and probably have a bit of
help with that!

     In this column, we'll explore the potentials and examine a few of the
beanstalks climbed.  We welcome comments from anyone whose life has been
changed by the magic of the modem.  We'll touch on many subjects, to
include all of the expanding horizons.  There may even be an article on the
lowly tagline, our new Poor Richard's Almanac.

        HAVE YOU:
                ... watched a talent grow?
                ... found a new vocation?
                ... enhanced an old vocation?
                ... found help with a problem?
                ... traveled and visited?
                ... started a relationship?
                ... met a mate?

     ... any and all of the above!  If so, please contact me routed in the
COMMON Conference at Node ID ->THEDOCK, and share your experience with us.

Talk to you later!


Jackie

                       Rehash of the May 9th Bash

     There are round-tables, there are parties, there are events but pure
joy is being in attendance at the Belasco's Bash!

Speaking of attendance, here's the list:

Bart Lidofsky             Emelia Harding       Michael Lee
Bill Harding              Eric Loeb            Mike Bauman
Bill Johnson              Gary Polisky         Mike Blake
Bill Leaming              Howard Karten        Pad Gajajiva
Bill Slattery             Inez Harrison        Penny Plant
Bill Weitz                Joey Galletta        Randi Kopp-to-be
Bob Brown                 Jon Amato            Rebecca Greif
Bob Litty                 JThomas Howell       Robert Bakley
Bruce Grief               Judy Friedman        Robin Greene
Carol Carmichael          Ken Halfon           Samantha Ciaston
D.K. Lee                  Lana Fox             Schlomoh Sherman
Dave Clark                Lewis Kopp           Shelly Dubin
     (From KWAJALEIN!)    Lisa Johnson         Skip Ross
David Johnson             Lori Alpert          Steve Dubin
Don Cheeks                Lou Kairys           Steve Nazorone
Dries Bessels             Lucien Greif         Steve Poggio
     (From HOLLAND!)      Lyn Rust             Steve Sambor
                                               Tammy Johnson

     The RIME Event of the year started by Bonnie Anthony getting ill and
not being able to attend.  Lou Kairys played chauffeur for Dries Bessels
and Dave Clark, Friday and Saturday until his back went out.  Dries and
Dave took the 5th under legal advice, and a reliable source informed me
that Lou stated that next year he'll probably have more people to get stuck
in a traffic jam with on the Cross Bronx Expressway throwing his back out.
The last I heard Dries and Dave were still at Lou's house!

     Penny Plant, Lyn Rust, Lana Fox, Don Cheeks and Mike Blake, staying
with the Belasco's, were greeted with a bar-b-que Friday which started at 6
p.m. and RIMEd into the wee hours.

     Saturday Morning, Pad came by and picked up Lyn and drove to Robin
Greenes house where Lori Alpert was waiting for their special trip to
Zabar's, deli extraordinary.  They got back to the Bash about 1 p.m. to
find it in full swing.  The weather cooperated, and all spilled out to the
patio so there was as much room for everybody as there was food.  Skip Ross
made lasagna and donated the fresh fruit and vegetables, with the largest
strawberries anybody had EVER seen, while Joey Galletta made 20 pounds of
great meatballs that got smothered in Skip's sauce.  What a treat!

     The bash continued after 9:00 p.m. on Saturday when Howard guided 19
RIMErs down to Say Eng Lok in Chinatown, Howard's favorite Chinese
restaurant.  Joining the (by now regular) out of towners were Bill and
Emelia Harding, Carol Carmichael, Bob Litty, Bob Bakley and Steve Poggio -
again they RIMEd into the wee hours.

     On Sunday after breakfast (bagels, cream cheese, lox and smoked fish),
Robin guided Lyn, Penny, Mike, Lori down to Greenwich Village.  They
started at Barnes & Noble on 18th St., walked down to Washington Square
Park, continued down to the beginning of Eighth Avenue and went to the Foul
Play Bookstore and walked around some more.  Robin, Lyn and Penny stopped
at Grandpa's Italian Restaurant (owned by Al Lewis, Grandpa of the Munsters
TV show and once on Car 54, Where Are You) while Mike and Lori continued on
to the Science Fiction Bookstore.  Eventually everyone got back together
and had dinner.

     (One of the meanings of RIME is "to cover with" and Robin certainly
had this situation "COVERED"!)

     Monday they went to Rockerfeller Center, 5TH Avenue, Stage Deli for
lunch and then home to another bar-b-que at Chez Belasco.

     Tuesday, they all went home.

     Howard is a GREAT GUY and the saying that behind every Great Man
there's a Terrific woman is spelled "E L A I N E"!

     An event such as this, with so much class can only be recognized as a
"BASH"!

     Howard and Elaine Belasco truly know how to hold a BASH!

     I'm convinced:

             "You don't need a reason, you just need RIME"!

[Note:  Skip Ross created The Poetry Corner on July 31, 1990 while he was
RIME's Conference Coordinator and meeting him was like coming face to face
with my creator!  THANKS SKIP!]

      PROGRAM:  Directory Freedom, Version 4.50

     The game of DOS shells is much like its street wise predecessor.  Each
person running the game (the author) has promised that under his shell is a
lifetime of easy, convenient DOS file access and manipulation.  Leading to
kitchensinkitis, the authors clearly miss the point that software can be
versatile, functional and affordable in one roll of the dice, without
having to include every feature.

     Directory Freedom (DF) has its visual roots in the reliable PC
Magazine programs CO and DR.  What began as a simple enhancement to the
program DC, by Peter Esherick, has blossomed into a full fledged utility.
From the screen layout to the function key assignments, DF follows the
path of efficiency and speed.

     DF's documentation appears to be professionally written.  I say
"appears," for Gordon Haff confesses to the fact that he has written the
documentation.  Laid out in a very organized, thoughtful manner, the
documentation allows you to quickly get up to speed with DF, while the
appendixes act as a useful reference for subjects like Patching
Instructions and User-Defined Commands.  As you read through the
documentation, the inclusion of page numbers and section numbers reassure
you that you are on the right path.

     Configuring DF for the first time use couldn't be easier.  Included in
the archive is a separate set-up program called DFCONFIG, which allows you
to configure almost every aspect of DF via menu selections.  Among the more
notable aspects of configuration are sort and verify defaults.  As a side
note, in the ever increasing hysterical world of viruses, DFCONFIG allows
you to make your configuration changes to the DF.COM file or to a separate
text based file.

     Using DF is easier than configuring it!  Standard key configurations
apply in DF, such as the SpaceBar for tagging/untagging files.  The screen
layout is simple to understand.  Your key assignments are always available
to be seen.  An example follows:

  Volume:             319,619,072 bytes free
  Destination disk has319,619,072 bytes free
  Row   1 of  26.  3,014,656 bytes/ 24 files

     The files are laid out in an easy to understand fashion, with the
actions that you can perform on the right.  If you hit the ALT key, a new
menu appears on the right displaying more options.  Again, if you hit the
CTRL key more options appear.

     Just what are these options you ask?  Well, DF ships with twenty
mainstay commands that range from copying a file to running a program to
swapping a video mode.  These options all run in conjunction with files
being tagged and execute quickly.  DF sometimes has trouble reporting
adequate error levels from the disk drive (when a file is in use by another
process, DF doesn't let you know this.)

     The strongest area of DFs composite consists of the user's ability to
define no less than ten key assignments, depending on the keyboard.  This
means that you can assign the function of TYPING an ANSI screen to
CTRL-F6, with a simple entry in DFCONFIG.  Your DOS shell literally
becomes an extension of yourself.  You no longer have to remember what
switches allow PKZIP to view and then test a file, for once DF is
configured for the action you will have it forever.

     Flexibility is a key feature of DF, with the configuration of function
keys being no exception.  Using DFCONFIG, you control whether a user set-up
function pauses after executing, refreshes the DF file screen or can be run
against more than one file.  With this blend of precision and control, your
tedious DOS chores become extremely automated.

     Convenience is a cornerstone of the DF enterprise.  Included in
DFCONFIG is the ability to set-up a drive table for quick access to the
drives you use most often.  This feature works by hitting the cursor keys
to move left and right in the drive table.  Suppose your drive table is
like so: CDEGH.  If you were to type DF C:\, you would start off in the
root directory of C.  If you wanted to quickly go to your H drive all that
you would have to do is hit your left cursor key.  The same filespec is
maintained from drive to drive.  A handy feature whose only problem is the
inability to configure the drive table on the fly in case you needed to add
a drive.

     Another convenience minded feature can be seen via the ALT-F10 key
press.  This key press allows you to create an archive by tagging files,
then hitting ALT-F10.  DF takes over the chore of passing filenames to the
archive with the proper switches, etc.

     A function where DF misses the convenience mark occurs when you simply
type DF C:\ from the root of C:, which brings DF up in the root directory
of C:.  Now, you tag some files to be copied to A:.  DF asks you where you
would like to copy to.  You say A:.  DF starts copying, but doesn't update
the DESTINATION FREE SPACE field.  Understandably, it shouldn't, because
you specified the same destination as source in the command line.  But
wouldn't it be nice to see how much space is left on what you are copying
to?

     As you get to use Df more and more, you begin to wonder how your life
in the CPROMPT world of complexity ever existed.

Rating Breakdown:
----------------

Performance     :       DF is quick, accurate and well written.  A few
9 out of 10             convenience twists could have been added.

Documentation   :       DF's documentation is well written with special
5 out of 5              care taken to explain common terms to newer
                        users.

Ease of Setup   :       Using DFCONFIG, setup is as easy as running the
5 out of 5              program.  Online help and choice of setup method
                        is a plus.

Ease of Learning:       Standard keys such as SpaceBar for
5 out of 5              tagging/untagging make getting up to speed
                        easy.

Ease of Use     :       Can you touch a function key?  Enough said.
5 out of 5

Error Handling  :       Improved immeasurably from the last release,
4 out of 5              still has problems at times.

Mean rating: 33 out of 35 or a 9.4 rating.

Caught in COMMON:

Hi to you all,

     I have been using a modem ever since I have had a PC which is for
approximately 8 years now.

     The first few years where difficult since there were not very many
BBS's around (at least in Holland).  Ever since then, I have been using
FIDO or related systems but was not happy with them.  About half a year
ago, I bought a 9600 BPS modem and started a search for 9600 BPS BBS's.

     I found HOTLINE in Amsterdam which carried yet another network called
RIME.  I started reading messages, got my first offline reader (after 8
years!!!) and got totally hooked!  Now, I am exchanging mail with people
all over the world, went to a party [Howard's bash! -Ed] in New York, met a
lot of GREAT people, etc!

     Just wanted to say to you all: "This is a great thing!  Let's do
everything we can to keep it that way!"

Brgds
Dries Bessels

7 - COMPUTING FOR THE BLIND              By Matt Roberts, Node ID ->EDSHOME
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Emergency! Root directory Deleted
     It is late at night and you have just installed a shareware program.
You try it and you decide to delete it.  After typing "del *.*" you
suddenly get a funny feeling that something is wrong.  What has happened?
You have just deleted your root directory on drive C.  Oh no!  But wait!
You have a boot disk for such an occasion, don't you?  If you don't read
on.  I will show you how you can easily create a boot disk for such a time
as this.

What Do I Need?
     Get a copy of your DOS system master disk and a blank disk.  Copy the
following files to the blank disk, after you have formatted it (COMMAND.COM
AUTOEXEC.BAT AND CONFIG.SYS.)  Now, put your master disk into a drive and
type the following: "sys a:." You have just transferred the system to your
blank disk or the boot disk.  You must edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS
files to insert the path for TSR'S and other programs that load when the
computer is turned on.  You might be asking what this has to do with
computing for the blind.  It is simple.  I had this situation happen to me
two weeks ago and I didn't have a boot disk.  I therefore had to waste
paper on my braille printer to know what was wrong.

     Speech users take note; your Autoexec.bat file probably brings up your
speech software.  Make sure you edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files
or your system won't talk.  I hope everyone will take a few minutes today
to prevent a headache later.

8 - SECURITY AND SAFE COMPUTING                By Curt Akin, Node ID ->MORE
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

     Several issues ago, Carol Carmichael warned of using the same password
on more than one BBS.  Well, the inevitable happened, and I'm sharing it
with you in the hope that it will urge you just a little bit more than
gently to use a different password on every BBS you call.

     Recently a very tasteless message was left on one of RIME's nodes to a
member of the Steering Committee.  The "sender" was one of RIME's
Conference Hosts.  He didn't send it, but he used the same password on all
the BBSs he called.  Yup, he should have known better, but we're not yet
all perfect.  Bingo!  It appears that a less than worthy-to-be-sysop
snatched the user name and password and ...well you know the end of the
story.

     Most board software will log the actual password used in failed access
attempts.  If you use a different password everywhere, then... another
Bingo!	Any worthy SysOp should contact any user when there has been an
obvious attempt to gain access with the wrong password.  All you have to do
is identify the board where you have used the UNIQUE password attempted,
and you've got the less-than-worthy SysOp dead cold.
     GOT IT?  DO IT!!!

9 - RIME's CONFERENCE VOLUME        From Bonnie Anthony, Node ID ->RUNNINGA
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Thought you all might be interested in this:

A week's total tally for mail through the network:

30,070 public messages 
1082 private unrouted messages 
5567 routed messages went through the network

Our largest conferences with messages over 1000 for the week were:
FORSALE - 1556 public messages
UPLINK -  1440 public messages
WINDOWS - 1115 public messages

Of the 5567 routed messages that went through the network
1218 were in COMMON
802 were in FORSALE
232 were in ADMIN

Those three conferences accounted for a little less than half the total
routed mail.
