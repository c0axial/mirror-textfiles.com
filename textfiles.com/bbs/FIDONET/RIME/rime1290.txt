Welcome to the December issue of RIME Times!  This issue is the 12th RIME
Times Newsletter and marks the end of another great RelayNet year!

I always think of this publication as more of a chronicle than a
newsletter.  No monthly publication can keep up with the "news" in this
fast paced means of communication we call RelayNet.  Take a few minutes to
peruse a few back issues and I think they will bring a smile to your face.
You will also realize what remarkable growth this "hobby" network of ours
has experienced.  I believe this is directly attributable to the competent
administration of the network.  We all may not agree with every action
taken, but there is no arguing that this is a highly successful network.
May I suggest you take a minute to give these folks a "Good work - way to
go!" message.  Whether it be that highly visible sister/brother team or the
behind-the-scenes SC members, conference hosts or sysops.  They all make
RelayNet one-heck-of-a fun place to be!

I would like to thank all who have contributed this past year and
especially thank the regular RIME Times contributors: Doug Maclean, Jim
Daly, Jeff Woods, James Spinelli & Ed Lazarowitz.  They have literally
carried the newsletter.  In fact, they have done such a great job this past
year, as editor and chief bottle washer of RIME Times I am giving them next
month off! (I am taking the issue off also, BTW. <g>)  The 1991 edition of
RIME Times will start with the February issue.  This will give us all a
break and will rejuvenate, invigorate, rehabilitate (aren't on-line
thesaurus's great!) and revitalize us for the coming new year!

This is of course another great issue! I'll completely dispense with the
usual article "teasers" and get on with the newsletter.  Well, almost
completely, be sure to read about the new "Official RelayNet Logo" contest.
This is a "real" contest this time and a good opportunity for you
artistically inclined folks to contribute to RelayNet.

Happy Holidays to All and we'll see you on the next relay!

SimTerm - A Communications Program for Novices & Experts

I recently obtained a file SIMTRM20.ZIP. Upon executing the program, I was
surprised to find this new, simple to use, communications program which has
all the features needed for basic BBS calling and downloading.

The program is by Jason Alward of Tillsonburg, Ontario, Canada. Among it's
greatest features are the built-in Zmodem file-transfer protocol, which
includes resume aborted or crashed transfers, internal ANSI 3.64 graphics,
and many features the larger programs have. The biggest surprise is that
the program requires only about 40K of disk space and less that 70K of RAM
space to run! This makes it an excellent program for carrying on a floppy
diskette and still having plenty of room for downloading files. It supports
com ports 1 through 4 and speeds to 19200 CPS. the dialing directory
handles up to 45 entries and supports auto redial and multiple number
tagging.

Here is the help screen found when you press the F1 key in SIMTERM.

+--¯^X^Y Selects. ENTER executes or just hit key in brackets.®---+

The program can be learned by someone familiar with larger programs in a
matter of a few minutes. It is being distributed as "shareware" and costs
only $20 to register. Voice support is at 1-519-842-9175 and the support
BBS is the RHPN BBS at 1-519-688-0008.

The program is available from my system, The Casino EBBS, and from various
other systems across the country.

Check it out! You won't be disappointed.

How many times did you need a quick way to determine a day of the week or
look at a calendar but you hate those TSR calendar programs.  Here is a
little program that will show you a single month or an entire year for
almost any date you select.  Here is the code:

    "September", "October", "November", "December",
};

void cal(int m,int y,char *p,int w);
int jan1(int yr);

            cal  NOV        will show the month of November for the
                            current year

            cal  feb 1953   shows the given month for the given year

            cal  1991       shows the whole year

For some fun use CAL SEP 1752.  This was the year that the Julian calendar
was converted to the Gregorian calendar.  The 2nd of September was followed
by the 14th!  This was done to bring the calendar back in step with the
seasons.  This program demonstrates the use of pointers and string
functions.  I hope you all enjoy it.

                          -----------------------

Last month I showed you a little Graphic of 4 Bytes being transmitted
ASYNCHronously.  Here it is again:

          E         K            I          M
      |--------|--------|   |--------|  |--------|
>-----| BYTE-4 | BYTE-3 |---| BYTE-2 |--| BYTE-1 |----->
      |--------|--------|   |--------|  |--------|

Let's enlarge BYTE-1 and take a look at the Bits inside of it:

                     M
          |---|------------|---|
          |   |            |   |
          | 1 |  01001101  | 0 |
          |   |            |   |
          |---|------------|---|
            ^  ^----------^  ^
            |       |        |
          STOP      |      START
           BIT      |       BIT

                    8
               DATA BITS

Remember last month that I told you that delays could be present between
ASYNCH transmitted BYTES?  Because of the possibility of a "delay" between
Bytes, the Hardware  (your MODEM) adds a "little "cushion" at the beginning
and end of the Byte in the form of a Bit.  These extra Bits are called a
Start Bit (always a 0) and a Stop Bit (always a 1).  The START Bit (0)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

tells the Modem to which you are transferring that the next Bit it receives
will be the start of the actual Data.  The STOP Bit (1) tells the receiving
Modem that the entire Byte has been sent and received.  When the full Data
Byte has been received, the hardware automatically discards the START and
STOP bits.

Incidentally, the actual Data Byte can be 7 Bits but only if the Data is
straight ASCII Text (see the September article for the explanation).

Enough for this month.  In January we will tackle the somewhat perplexing
topic of PARITY and BREAK signals.

    !!  HAPPY HOLIDAYS to you and yours !!

I would like to announce a new conference on RIME.  Unlike many other RIME
conferences that provide technical support or entertainment this conference
supports the most important part of any computer system, the human being.
The conference is the Cancer Recovery Conference (national number 242).
The Cancer conference is dedicated to provide a place for emotional support
for people affected by cancer and their families.  Medical people and
interested parties are also welcomed.  Threads will include any type of
support the membership requires.  In pain? Feeling depressed or isolated?
The Cancer Conference will let you know you are not alone in your battle.
Sometimes just letting things out can make a person feel better.

I requested this conference for a personal reason.  Last December I was
diagnosed as having a tumor on my elbow.  Most was removed at that time but
a couple of months ago the tumor returned and I started chemo therapy.
People in my other seven conferences have been so supportive and provided
such strength I wanted to create a place for others in the same situation
to come for support.  After talking to Skip, Bonnie and Howard the Cancer
recovery conference was born.  Since this is a public service conference
some changes were permitted.  For one, Skip suspended the requirement for a
certain number of nodes and hubs to initiate the conference.  This turned
out not to be a problems since many of my friends have already started to
carry Cancer.  Bonnie has also given permission for the use of aliases.
Slightly stronger language is also permitted as long as it is not directed
towards anyone in a personal attack.  If someone in the conference wants to
say how bad they feel they are free to express themselves.  In short, the
Cancer Recovery conference will be maintained much the same as the Recovery
conference.  Many people on the Recovery conference have already offered
their support of this new conference and I hope to continue close ties
between both conferences.  Many people I know in chemo become addicted to
the pain medications and illegal drugs as a result of the feeling that
manifest during the fight against cancer.  By maintaining close ties

between the two recovery conferences I hope to provide a multifaceted means
to help many people.

I will be joined by my co-host Steve King from DBORED in bring this
conference to RIME.  Bonnie Anthony has also offered to help us out with
the medical viewpoint.  Steve is also working getting and oncologist to
become  a regular to help provide support.   The threads are light right
now, even by new conference standards.  We need people expressing
themselves before things get moving.  It may take some time for people to
become use to expressing themselves in this type of conference but as
people begin to join us and share their feelings I am very sure that
conference will exceed expectations.  I have found the people here in RIME
to always rally to support others.  Too bad the recent article in Business
Week could not portray this side of RIME.  This disease hit particularly
hard around the holidays.  It is fortunate that the administration here
helped to get this conference going in such a short time.

I urge all hubs, nodes and sysops out there to request the Cancer recovery
conference and to place an announcement on your boards to let people know
about it.  Please permit people to sign on using aliases for the purpose of
accessing either Recovery conference.  We can only help people if they join
us.  Please help spread the word.  There is a place that cares, a place to
go to help and be helped.

                Happy Holidays all, and God Bless
                        Doug MacLean

Poetry To Suit Your Mood
(Copyright 1990 Inez Harrison)

            I FOUND YOU

You are,
my love,
my life.
Lead,
and I shall follow,
for I have looked for you,
for so long,
so many times before.
I've been lead astray,
but for the love of love,
I found my way.
Searching.
Hoping.
Wishing.
Praying.
I found you.
My lease on life,
my dream of dreams.
I found you,

need I say More...


                      "LOVE ME"

If at anytime I have hurt your feelings,
I haven't done so intentionally.

If I have caused you discomfort or pain,
it's because I've felt these things and projected them onto you.

If I have hurt your pride,
        which you have so much of,
it's because, your sensitive nature let me.

If at anytime I've made you feel I didn't love you,
it's because, during the time, I felt unloved.

If my carefree attitude made you feel I didn't care,
it's because I felt uncured for.

If at anytime I made you feel unwanted,
it's because, I too, felt unwanted.

Me, being who I am,
and,
you being the one I love,
must also bear my burden,
for we are one.

So, if I have hurt your feelings,
love me all the more,
because,
                it's what I need.

ANNOUNCING - conference 250 - Our connection to Desert Shield and our
service men in Saudi Arabia.

This conference is for support between families with members in the Armed
Services and stationed in Saudi Arabia.  We are also hooking up directly
with the private BBS at Ryadal, Saudi Arabia so that messages may be sent
directly to those of you who would like to communicate with our service men
stationed there or who have access to this system.  the conference host
will be Mike Nugent (idcode ->CAPCON) and we appreciate the work he has
done and is doing to make this connection work for us.

TAGLINE OF THE MONTH:
"Error finding COLDBEER.CAN  Sysop not loaded!"
(As seen on a post by Edward Cowling)

MALFUNCTION OF THE MONTH:
Bonnie Anthony forgets to "Auto-send" the Newsletter!
(I could not resist.)

PROTRACTED THREAD OF THE MONTH:
"am I iliterat"
(Thread started by poor speller Naomi Bedwin of the UK.  At last count,
about half of the male RIME participants want a date with Naomi.)

CONNECT LOVE!:
We have a romance on the network.  Two users who met in UPLINK began to use
the private mail feature and also began talking by phone.  The male user
leaves his city and job and moves in with female user 1000 miles away.
They are in love and are planning to make it permanent.  Details at Ten!
(or the February issue..)
