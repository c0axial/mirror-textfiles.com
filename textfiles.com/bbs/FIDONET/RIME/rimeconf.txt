            For the use of RIME participants to search out those hard to  
    get files, or to find files to do a specific job or task. Users will  
    place their post requesting a specific file name that they are looking
    for, or post a description of what the file should accomplish.        
    Responders would reply to the message with the specific file name, and
    where the user will be able to pick it up. This conference would also 
    be open to those hobby programmers that would be willing to write a

            Beginner, intermediate and advanced PPL programmers. With this
    new rich programming language, PCB sysops can customize their systems 
    in ways never before imagined. PPL code, while easy to write does     
    require a knowledge of programming, and hints and tricks can be passed
    down to new comers to the field from the more experienced PPL         
    programmers. More advanced PPL programmers can swap methods that solve
    even the most difficult problems. There is not a PCB sysop out there  
    that does not take advantage of PPE programs.

            Where authors may join together and collectively write a      
    story. One writer begins a story by telling about a new setting and a 
    basic cast of characters. Each writer adds to the story by telling    
    more about the lives of the characters. This continues until the      
    writers reach a group conclusion. Different types of stories can be   
    created at the same time.

            The study of modern folklore - tracing the origins of urban   
    legends and examining how they have evolved. The work of Jan Brunvand 
    is our inspiration, but we will go our own directions as the explosion
    of misinformation takes us. This is, of course, not primarily a place 
    to spread rumors; amusing and interesting lore will be welcomed but   
    only if clearly identified as such.
