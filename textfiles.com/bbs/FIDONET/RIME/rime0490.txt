DOWNLOADING FILES from a Bulletin Board System (BBS)

NOTE: These instructions pertain to TELIX, QMODEM and SMARTCOM Users
calling a PCBoard system.  Other COMMunications programs
and BBS systems will have similar protocols.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the primary benefits of the nationwide BBS system is access to
a VAST library of PUBLIC DOMAIN & USER SUPPORTED
software...and all for just the price of a phone call!!!

At first, the DOWNLOAD (D/L) process seems complicated and intimidating.
In actual fact, most Communications programs completely automate the entire
process and a D/L can be accomplished with just a few keystrokes.

1.>  The first step in DOWNloading is determining which files or programs
on a particular BBS are of interest to you.  Almost all BBS's will group
their programs in various directories according to category and/or func-
tion...
            for example:  1. DOS UTILITIES
                          2. BUSINESS PROGRAMS
                          3. COMMUNICATIONS
                          4. SPREADSHEET TEMPLATES (123,SCalc-5,etc.)
                          5. FILE MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS
                          6. GAMES
                          7. NEW UPLOADS (Not checked by SYSOP!!)

The PCBoard BBS Main Menu command to look at the available directories is
"F".  This single stroke command generally gives you a listing of all the
available Download directories (usually by #).  When you spot a DIRectory
that may hold files of interest, select that specific number and ALL of
the files in that DIRectory will be listed.

NOTE: If you have logged on to a particular BBS before and remember the di-
rectory number that holds the file(s) you want, just type "F x" (where x=
the directory #) at the Main Menu and you by-pass the listing of all the
directories and immediately see a listing of files in that specific DIRec-
tory.

2.>  When you locate a file that you wish to D/L, type "D" and the BBS will
ask you for the name of the file you wish to D/L.  At this prompt, type in
the name of the file EXACTLY as it appeared on the listing including the
extension - then hit <ENTER>.

The BBS will search ALL of its directories for a file name (and extension)
match.  When the file is found, you will get a listing of information about
file SIZE, number of transfer BLOCKS, and approxi- mate D/L time required.

NOTE:  If you do not have enough time left on the BBS to handle the entire
file, the system will advise you and abort the transfer. (See why you
should UPGRADE !!)  On a "friendly" BBS, you will not be disconnected dur-
ing a D/L if you run out of time during the actual file transfer due to
slowdown in the transfer due to say, line noise.

3.>  As soon as the FILE information is listed,the system checks to see if
you have set a DEFAULT protocol (Zmodem, XModem, etc.) in your USER Config-
uration.  If you have, the system will ask if that is the one you wish to
use for this File transfer and you may accept the protocol or change it at

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
APR         RELAYNET INTERNATIONAL MESSAGE EXCHANGE NEWSLETTER         1990
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

this point.  If you have your DEFAULT protocol set to (N)one, you must tell
the system what you want to use.

You will now get a prompt advising you that the BBS is...... "Ready to
Send".....

=======================================================================

4.>  SMARTCOM:   Hit the <F1> function key which will take you to the
     ========    SMARTCOM-MAIN Menu.

     QMODEM: Hit the PgDn key which will bring up the QM protocol Window.
   & TELIX:
     ========

5.>  SMARTCOM: Select 4. RECEIVE FILE.
     ========
     a. Press 1 to select ERROR FREE protocol.

     b. When prompted "ENTER FILE NAME", type the name of the file to be
        received (it doesn't have to be the same as the name that you
        asked the BBS to send to you-in fact, if you just press <ENTER>
        without typing a file name, the system will assign the filename
        "TEMP".
     c. Press <ENTER>.

     QMODEM: a. Select the SAME protocol that you specified in the BBS!!!
   & TELIX :
     ======
             b. Another Window will open and show you the "Default"
                PATH and the filename (example:C:\UPLOAD\PKARC.EXE)

             c. If the PATH is correct, press <ENTER>.

                If you want the new file to go to a different sub-directory
                or if you want to name it something else, change whatever
                part of the line shown as necessary, press <ENTER>
                necessary, then.......

6.>  As the file is being SENT by the BBS and RECEIVED by your system, the
status Box or Line will keep you advised of the FILE transfer process.

7.>  When the D/L has been successfully completed the Status line will show
"RECEIVE COMPLETE xxxxx bytes" and the system will BEEP you.

NOTE:  If there is interference on your phone (called "line noise"), the
Status line will indicate this showing repeated attempts to send
file BLOCKS.  If the attempts exceed 7 in a particular Block, the
transfer will be aborted (usually very evident during electrical
storms).

8.>  SMARTCOM:  Press <F1> and you will be returned to the BBS Menu.

     ======

            A D D I T I O N A L    H I N T S  &  H E L P S
            ==============================================
1.>  Where is the file I just Downloaded?

QMODEM and TELIX Users will set the sub-DIRectory to receive new
files when the program is Configured (\DOWNLOAD or \DL is easy to
remember).

HAYES-SMARTCOM Users will find the file in the Directory where your
Communication program resides (probably C:\HAYES if you are running
SMARTCOM II).

2.>  How do I DOWNload to another DIRectory if I am using SMARTCOM?
At the SMARTCOM Main Menu, select "3. Select File Command" and then  "S"
for "Set Path".  Backspace over the default directory name and type in
the name of the directory to which you want the D/L's to go.

               for example; C:\DL

REMEMBER!!! When you re-boot your system, the D/L path will be set at
            the default directory.!!!

NOTE: I prefer to use my C:\DL sub-directory.  By doing so, I can then
manipulate the new file anyway I want to without having to worry
about damaging any of your Communication program files.  Also, it
is easier to un-ZIP files if you only have 1 or 2 to select from.

3.>  I want my DOWNloads to go to a floppy drive..

     Follow the same procedures as above, except set the path to A:\

   REMEMBER!!!  You must have a FORMATted disk in the A: drive and that
                the total Download cannot exceed the capacity of the
                diskette.  (360K or 1.2MB on 5.25" and 720K or 1.4MB
                on the 3.50") Don't forget that if you already have files
                on the floppy, your available D/L space will be reduced.
                ( Run CHKDSK on A: to determine available space.)

4.>  I know that I saw a file last week on the BBS that I can't find now.
     Where is it?

   SYSOPS periodically review the D/L activity on files and may delete the
   name from the DIRectory if there has been little or no interest.  Or,
   there may have been an upgrade and the filename has been changed.

   Leave a message for the SYSOP and he'll advise you how to find the file.

One of the most useful routines to have in your 'C' bag of tricks is one to
copy files.  Here is a simple routine that will be improved next month.
The parameters are simple copyfile(char *source, char *destination, int
overwrite, int touch) where source is the name of the file to copy destina-
tion is the name of the destination file overwrite is a flag to determine
if the destination file should be overwritten if it exists (0 = no, 1 =
yes) and touch is a flag that if it is one the time and date stamp will be
copied from the source file.

int    copyfile(char *, char *,int,int);
copyfile(srcfile,destfile,overwrite,touch)
char    *srcfile,*destfile;
int     overwrite,touch;        /* flags */
    int src,dest;
    char    *buffer;
    int n;
    union   REGS    r;
    buffer = malloc(BUFSIZE);
    src = open(srcfile,O_RDONLY | O_BINARY);
    if((dest = open(destfile,O_CREAT | O_EXCL, S_IREAD
                                     | S_IWRITE )) == -1)
    /*if((dest = creat(destfile,S_IWRITE)) == -1)*/
    {

some more error checking.
