Welcome to the October issue of RIME Times!  We have yet another fine issue
for you.  In addition to our host of great regular columns we have some new
additions.  Inez Harrison the Poetry conference host starts a regular
"Poetry Corner" column.  The first two poems are from Inez, with subsequent
selections coming from the poetry conference.  We hope each month to
produce a RIME Family Tree, a graphic representation of our Super Regional
HUB's.  This month's selection of "off the wall" articles includes a highly
scientific column on the nature of Light vs Dark and a cutting-edge expose
on the computer industry.  We have the usual slew of new conference and new
node announcements (amazing!) and the results of a tremendously successful
puzzle contest.

Also, for those sysops who are interested in a pre-packaged on-line version
of RIME Times, George Cuccia of Node ->UNION is breaking out the articles
every month for display in the TextView door (by Joseph Sheppard).  He is
making this on-line version of RIME Times available at NETNODE a couple of
days after the newsletter is released.  Request RmmyyTV.ZIP where "mmyy" is
the month and year of release.  Thanks George!

See you on the next relay!

Let me first introduce myself, my name is Patrick Lee and I am the
Conference Host of the New Users conference on RIME.  I have been with RIME
for just over a year now and a lot has changed since then.  So let me tell
all of you a bit about myself first.

I am currently a senior at Stuyvesant High School here in New York City.
For me, school is both challenging and fun.  Challenging because of the
various Advanced Placement courses that I have taken and will be taking;
and fun because all of my friends.  Right now, I am taking mostly science
and mathematics classes and will probably continue in this direction.  The
most important decision I have to make in the coming months is of course
with college.  In addition to that, there is the Westinghouse research
paper, along with several other contests.

My first computer was a Texas Instrument model 99/A, I think.  Many of you
probably remember that it was a pretty good machine for games, but I did

managed to write a few BASIC programs with it.  Later came the Apple IIc,
IBM PC/XT, and finally my current set up -- a 386SX with VGA graphics.  My
modem came along in July of 1989 when I was taking a programming course at
New York University and had remote access to their computers.  Shortly
after, I started BBSing and found the New York Running Board and RelayNet
(tm) in August of 1989.

In the same month, a new board went up here in the city called the Aardvark
BBS and David Greenberger was (still is) the Sysop.  David has given me
much help over the past year and I thank him for that.  Aardvark is now a
RIME node and is also my home board for RIME.

In the first few months I was on RelayNet (tm), I found myself learning a
great deal from the various conferences that I read and within a short
period, I was actively participating in the message base instead of doing
file transfers all the time.  [grin]  I took over as the Conference Host of
the New Users conference from Dave Schubert some time in 1989 as he was too
busy with his own board.  The reason why I wanted to become a Conference
Host was because RelayNet (tm) has given me so much and I thought it was
about time to give some back.

The New Users conference itself does not have very well defined boundaries
but instead  overlaps into some of the other technical conferences.  There
have been talks about the differences between 386DX and 386SX processors,
off-line readers, message routing, communication programs, and many more.
Basically, it is a conference where a user can come in and ask questions
regarding computers, BBSing, off-line readers, mail doors, etc.

I am proud to serve RIME as a Conference Host, and I also want to thank all
the experienced users in the New Users conference for helping out with all
the questions that have appeared in that conference.  So, if you like the
sound of the New Users conference, why not drop in and say hello some time.
The NETNODE conference number for it is 84.

If you want to know where I usually hang out, simply look into the RIME
Directory and it will list all the conferences I follow.  In addition, I am
the co-Sysop of the Aardvark BBS at (212) 496-8324 (node ID ->AARDVARK) and
also pick up my RelayNet (tm) mail from it.

                      THIS MASK I WEAR

Sometimes behind this smile, there are rivers of tears.
I even laugh to keep from crying.  Every now and then
a sad look will slip its way in and you'll ask what's
wrong, I'll smile and say nothing,

                        so, don't be fooled by this mask I wear.

In a crowd, sometimes I'm so alone;
Talking not thinking on the telephone.
I look at T.V. through tear filled eyes;
I smile through most painful goodbyes,

                        so, don't be fooled by this mask I wear.

I try to help others through thick and thin;
To helping others there is no end.
I laugh and joke when the chips are down;
But behind this smile (sometimes) there lies a frown,

                        so, don't be fooled by this mask I wear.

My relationship with my lover came to an end;
To keep face, I smiled and lifted my chin.
I walked in the rain to cover my tears;
I sat in the sunlight to hide my fears.

                        so, for Gods sake,
                        Don't be fooled by this Mask I Wear.

        GOOD FEELINGS!

 Good feelings talking to me,
       from last night,
       the night before,
    and the night before.

       I think of
        the kiss,
       the touch,
        the kiss,
       the touch.

       Good feelings
   embedded in my brain,
       from the cry,
        the shout,
       the holler,
       the scream.

       I think of
    untold pleasure,
       feeling
   untold thoughts.

       Good feelings

  sneaking in my dreams,
creeping down the sheets,
  crawling on my flesh.

       I think of
        my hands,
       your hands,
        my hands,
       your hands.

       Good feelings,
    sapping my strength,
   draining my thoughts,
    maddening pleasure.

      I think of
       ecstasy,
     tranquility,
      serenity.

     Good feelings
 creeping down my back,
     up my ankles,
   around my waist.

     I think of
    the feelings.

                               YEAH!

IMPORTANT - the CONFER.ZIP  file has been renamed to RIMECONF.ZIP.  We feel
that this name better describes the contents of this file.  From now on
request RIMECONF.ZIP for new conference information.  I have also set up a
small task force to go over this file and convert it into a more useful
format for us.

This is my last conference announcement before the expected return of Skip
Ross to his usual position as conference coordinator.  Thank you for your
helpfulness and understanding during this brief tenure of mine.  And now
for the new conferences:

The Super Regional HUB that I belong to has it's own very active regional
conference.  Lana Fox, the HUB operator (Don Cheeks too!), came up with a
graphic representation of all the HUBs and Nodes that relay with her.  We
thought it would be fun to publish this graphic "tree" of our "family" and
encourage other Super Regionals to do the same.  Brian Miller of HUBCHAN
has also submitted his family tree.

Have you ever wanted to create a prompt from a program or a batch file that
would wait a certain amount of time and then provide a default?  Here is a
little routine that will permit you to program just that.  It is called
timeout.  The prototype is as follows:

int timeout(char *prompt, char ch, int time, int silence, int reverse,int
to);

Here, 'prompt' is the character string that will be displayed.  'ch' is the
trigger character that the routine waits for.  'time' is the number of
seconds to wait.  'silence' is a flag that controls if you see a countdown.
'reverse' is a flag that reverses the action, instead of waiting for the
trigger character.  Any character but the trigger will return 1 to a flag
that returns a 2 if the routine times out.

Normally, if the trigger character is hit the routine returns a 1.  Any
other key will return a 0.

Now for some big news!  I am pleased to announce my seventh conference,
(drum roll, please): IDC.  Chip Rabinowitz is co-hosting this conference
that will provide support for all of Interactive Data Concepts products
including the new CXL.  As most of you know, CXL is one of the best and
most popular 'C' libraries around.  Chip has improved this fantastic
library with greater speed and a host of new and improved functions.

Got the Parallel picture?

We know that when the 8 bits enter the exhibit at the same time the lines
are Parallel. However, if there is only 1 Gate available then the 8 bits
must Enter one at a time.  Like this:

As you can see, (M)ike and his 8 Data bits enter the Gate 1 bit at a time
while (A)lice and (N)ick wait in a single-file line for their turn to move
ahead.

When SERIAL transmission is used between computers, all of the Data must
travel in a single line from one computer to the other.  Since the data
stream is sent 1 bit at a time, only one wire is required.

Obviously the disadvantage of Serial transmission is that it is much slower
than Parallel transmission because only 1 bit is sent at a time as compared
to the 8 bit data stream in Parallel.

The advantage of Serial transmission is the cost of wiring.  Since only 1
wire is needed, the wiring cost is only 1/8 that of Parallel!  This adds up
fast when a communications link goes from one city to another, or even from
one building to another in the same city!

Of course the real advantage in terms of the BBS world is the ability to
transmit across standard telephone lines.  This would be impossible to send
Parallel transmissions because standard telephone lines do not have 8
conductors.

Now that we understand the difference between SERIAL and PARALLEL Data
transmission and why the BBS world uses SERIAL, next month, we will explore

the concepts of just how the Data is handled at each end of the
communications session.  See you next month!

                 Results of a New study on Light vs. Dark

For years it has been believed that electric bulbs emitted a substance or
energy called light.  Recent information, however, has proven otherwise.

Electric bulbs don't emit light - they suck dark.  Thus we call these bulbs
dark suckers.  Dark Sucker Theory presents a number of basic theorems
concerning the properties of dark.  For example:

      1. The speed of dark is greater than that of light.

      2. Dark has greater mass than light.

The basis of Dark Sucker Theory is that electric bulbs suck dark.  Take for
example, the dark suckers in the room where you are.  There is less dark
right next to them than there is elsewhere.  The larger the dark sucker,
the greater its capacity to suck dark.  As with all things, dark suckers
don't last forever.  Once they are full of dark, they can no longer suck.
This is proven by the black spot on a full dark sucker.  A candle is a
primitive dark sucker.  A new candle has a white wick.  You will notice
that after the first use, the wick turns black, representing the dark which
has been sucked into it.  Unfortunately, these dark suckers have a limited
range.

There are also portable dark suckers.  The bulbs in these units can't
handle all of the dark by themselves, and must be aided by a dark storage
unit.  When the dark storage unit is full, it must be either emptied or
replaced before the portable dark sucker can operate again.

Dark has mass.  When dark goes into a dark sucker, friction from this mass
passing through another mass will generate a certain amount of heat.  It is
commonly known that an operating dark sucker generates heat.  The dark
suckers with the greater capacities force the dark to travel through the
impeding media at greater rates of speed, so they develop greater amounts
of heat.  Thus, it is not wise to touch an operating dark sucker.

Now to offer proofs of the theories stated above.

First, that dark is faster than light.  If you were to stand in an
illuminated room in front of a closed dark closet then slowly open the

closed door, you would see the light slowly enter the closet: but since the
dark is so fast you are not able to see the dark leave the closet.

Secondly, that dark has more mass than light.  If you swim just below the
surface of a lake, you will see a lot of light.  As you swim deeper and
deeper, you notice it gets slowly darker and darker.  This is because the
dark sinks to the bottom of the lake and the light rises to the top.

          LEGAL ASPECTS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND THE BBS, Part 2

Last time, we briefly discussed the idea of a sysop as an information
resource manager. In this month's discussion, let's take a brief tour of
those resources which the sysop is managing. Our first recourse is
software.

For legal purposes, software is defined as the collection of materials that
contains, expresses, and explains a computer program.  This definition
includes a program in machine-readable form contained on magnetic media,
the printouts containing the source and object code, the programmer's notes
and working papers, and the user manual.

The rather unique nature of software has been a constant source of problems
for the courts, who can't seem to decide consistently whether software is
tangible or intangible, or something in between. If it is tangible, it is
also covered by the Uniform Commercial Code, otherwise, it is not. To date,
the courts have defined software as tangible for some purposes, and
intangible for others, with different courts sometimes adopting conflicting
positions.

Another source of confusion is whether software is considered an artistic
expression, something like a book, or a product of an engineering process.
The courts continue to have trouble deciding how to regard the process of
software development. The result has been much debate and confusion over
copyright and patent protection of software.

In spite of these issues, computer software is still regarded by law as
property that can be owned and transferred, like any product.  Software is
categorized as intellectual property since it is a result more of mental
effort rather than a manufacturing process. However, additional confusion
will no doubt ensue as the field of computer-assisted software engineering
proliferates. It is important for sysops to understand the nature of

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

software and to understand the various methods available to protect this
resource. It is important because, in many instances, the sysop is the
guardian and provider of software stored on the BBS. In addition, many
sysops are themselves software authors.

The owner of software has the exclusive right to control and use the
software he or she has produced. Any infringement of this right can be
stopped through legal means. However, a software author will not make any
money from his software unless he gives up some control. You give up some
or all control in one of two ways:

        1.  By the assignment of rights
        2.  By license

On the one hand, it may be rather easy to determine who owns a particular
piece of software. Let's say that you are unemployed or self-employed, and
you develop a program entirely by yourself in your own home. Here, it is
clear who is the owner. However, if your buddy is helping you with the
programming, it is no longer so clear that you are the sole owner. There is
an interesting sideline in the BBS arena. Many software authors use a
select group of systems to test and validate software. Some of these test
sites respond by providing alternatives for program operation and ideas for
additional features. Such enhancements and ideas may only serve to confuse
the ownership issue, particularly if they are in writing and are well-
documented, and are included in the finished product. Simple
acknowledgements may not suffice for attributing possible or potential
ownership rights. The key is that the particular method of expression is
what is potentially copyrightable, not the ideas themselves. So, if a test
site actually writes changes, such may be considered the expression of the
ideas. In order to prevent potential problems, all agreements and
understandings need to be defined, agreed to, documented and in writing
BEFORE a project commences.

The assignment of rights and licenses come into play here. Let's look at
each method.

The assignment of rights, transfers all rights in the software to someone
else. This can be done by selling the software outright for a price, or
through a royalty arrangement.

License for use, on the other hand, does not involve the transfer of
ownership rights, but only the rights necessary for a more limited purpose,
such as the use of the software. In this manner, the actual owner maintains
all of the rights not specifically granted or transferred by the actual
license agreement.

Ownership of software carries with it the right to protect against
infringement of rights. It may be suggested that this is an obligation
rather than a right per se. However, in the legal sense, it is a right
because no one else is permitted to intervene and do it for you.

There are four methods available to protect software ownership. These are:

        1.  Trade Secrets
        2.  Copyrights
        3.  Trademarks
        4.  Patents

Let's spend a few moments to examine each of these methods. (NOTE: This is
not a treatise on each method, but merely a very brief, fundamental
presentation of each.)

TRADE SECRETS: this area of the law protects the information, devices, and
processes that give you a competitive advantage over those who do not know
what you know about something. For software, it is typically applied during
the development and testing stages. However, to be considered a trade
secret, the software must contain some unique aspect -- that is, some
method or methods that are considered unique to the functioning of the
program. Some of the things that are subject to trade secrets include:
customer lists, testing results, and even the names of the programmers.

The second method is the copyright. Whereas trade secrets protect
commercial ideas, regardless of the method of expression, copyrights
protect only the actual expression of ideas and not the ideas themselves.

Before software can be copyrighted, it must meet three basic requirements:

        1.  It must be expressed in a tangible form
        2.  It must be an original work by the author
        3.  It must not be part of the public domain

There are two ways in which software can fall into the public domain:

        1.  Intentionally
        2.  Through Negligence

"Intentionally" is rather obvious. However, "negligence" includes such
things as (a) publishing without a valid copyright notice, and (b) failing
to correct the error within five years of original publication.

Copyrights last for the life of the author plus 50 years. However, if the
work is classified as "made for hire," the copyright lasts for 75 years
from the date of first publication. If you can prove that someone has
infringed upon your copyright, you can take them to court only if the
copyright is registered with the U.S. Copyright Office.

Our third method is the trademark. A trademark is a word or symbol that is
used to set your product apart from the products of others.  However, not
every word or phrase or symbol can qualify. Words, symbols, phrases that
are determined to be "of general use" that describe the nature of the
product generally will not qualify. For example, recent concern of the
possibility of applying a trademark to the term "shareware," may, indeed,
be contested as it may be shown to be a term of general use that is applied
to describe the nature of a product.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
OCT         RELAYNET INTERNATIONAL MESSAGE EXCHANGE NEWSLETTER         1990
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Another important aspect pertaining to trademarks is that software
trademarks cannot be too generic or too universally descriptive either.  In
the recent SEA/PKWare lawsuit, SEA's position seemed to be that the term
"ARC" was interpreted to be not a term of general use, but that which was
applied in defining a particular product. Of course, since the case was
settled out of court, PKWare may have acknowledged that possibility, and,
as such, SEA owns the phrase as used in the software archiving process.

To establish a trademark, you have to select a name, but also make sure
that the name is not being used by someone else. Duplication of names is
permitted in certain instances, provided, for example, that confusion does
not result, and the products are in completely different industries.

As a sidebar, there's the law of unfair competition. Such laws are defined
not on the federal level, but on the state level. This law protects honest
businesses from unscrupulous competitors, and also protects the general
public from deception. At times this law may be applied in situations where
you cannot apply the laws of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, and
patents.

Our last method of software protection is the patent. Of all the various
protection schemes, patent law provides the best protection. If you hold a
patent for an invention, it is applicable for 17 years. Within this period,
no one can duplicate your invention. Unlike other protection schemes,
patent law protects against what is called "independent development of an
invention." What this means is that regardless of whether someone else knew
about your idea or not, if you have a patent, your invention cannot be
duplicated, period. But, here's the kicker: to date, most computer programs
are ineligible for a patent.  The Patent Office's position is that you
cannot patent something that is based on the laws of nature or upon mental
processes. According to the Patent Office, computer programs are or contain
algorithms -- mathematical formulas -- which are mental processes, and,
therefore, are not patentable.

However, exceptions do creep in. The Supreme Court, in the Diamond v. Diehr
case in 1981, stated that programs may be patentable when they are an
inseparable part of the process or device that is patentable.

There is another side to this coin, too. Programs on ROM chips may be
patented since the program may be said to be part of the hardware. However,
such logic may be suspect because a program on ROM may be replaced by a
program on disk that is read into RAM. Usually, this latter approach may
not be patented. Further, you cannot patent something unless it is
considered "novel" or at least "not obvious."  Programs that automate
office functions previously performed manually, for example, generally do
not qualify because they are not novel enough, or tend to be rather
obvious.

This concludes Part 2. In Part 3 of our series next month, we'll explore
the various legal aspects that involve the use of the BBS to market and
distribute the software resource.

Part 3 begins the first serious attempt to define and apply the sysop's
potential legal responsibilities and accountabilities regarding BBS
operation itself.

Novell-DRI Marriage Spells Doom For Microsoft Stock

PC industry analysts throughout North America were caught off guard today
when news surfaced of a strategic marketing alliance between Novell &
Digital Research.

Redmond, Washington based Microsoft, is a competitor to both companies.
Their stock has been plummeting ever since the announcement.

Provo, Utah based Novell markets Netware, a Local Area Network (LAN)
operating system which connects many PC's together.  Most surveys estimate
that they have a 70% share of the PC LAN market.

Digital Research, of Monterey, California was dwarfed by Microsoft in the
early 1980's.  At that time their CP/M 86 operating system was passed up by
buyers in favor of Microsoft MS DOS.  However, DR has just released a DOS
of their own which is far superior -- sending Microsoft back to the drawing
board.

Under the terms of the Novell-DR agreement, each workstation attached to a
Netware LAN is entitled to run DR DOS free of charge.  To sweeten the pot
they've thrown in GEM, Digital Research's graphical user interface (GUI) --
and competitor to Microsoft bread & butter Windows.  Additional licenses
for DR DOS & GEM are available for PC's which are not attached to LAN's
for a list price of $49.95.  Egghead Discount Software Stores already has
them in stock & is discounting them at $39.95.

The killer blow is that the prices on Netware have actually been reduced by
20%.  And all this at a time when Microsoft was just gearing up to push
their own LAN operating system.

The DR DOS/GEM LAN package began shipping immediately upon announcement of
the agreement.  All purchasers of Netware since July 1, 1990 are entitled
to the DR DOS/GEM package at no charge. Customers who purchased Netware
before that can receive the package by purchasing Novell's Netware
Assurance updates.

Patricia Schnaidt, Editor of LAN Magazine said, "Novell has really geared
up for this one.  We're had reports from our readers that they're receiving

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

their updates the day after they order them.  Not only that, but Novell has
increased their advertising budget.  This is really healthy for the
financial position of our magazine."

Bill Gates, Microsoft CEO was quoted as saying, "First those Californians
invade the NorthWest and buy up all of our cheap housing.  Then they want
our water.  They can insult us all they want with those God awful pink sun
glasses.  But I'll be damned if they're going to take our operating system
market away."

Gary Kildahl, Digital Research's CEO replied by saying, "We feel that the
operating system technology is once again where it belongs.  In the land of
High Technology & The Beach Boys.  My old buddy Bill brought his own
problems on.  Our programs free RAM (memory) up while his squanders it.
We'll make them hurt so bad that they'll beg to sell us their water."

C.E. Langenberg is a Seattle based end user of PC & minicomputer products
and a part time white water river rafter.  He was last seen picking up a
Logitech serial mouse off of the floor behind his computer in preparation
for use with GEM.

C.E. said, "I've never had a problem making any program work with Netware
or DR DOS.  But Microsoft obviously feels threatened by both of these
products.  They intentionally made Windows & the DOS 4 Shell wrestle with
both Netware & DR DOS.  As we used to say out on the farm -- the chickens
always come home to roost. Anyway, those Californians better not screw with
the water of any river that I raft on."

John Ginnanne, East Coast personal computer expert, known for his good
humor, was not available for comment.  He was last seen in the midst of a
flock of sheep.  They were believed headed for a local software store to
buy Windows 3.0.  A bystander distinctly heard them saying, "Mee'e'e'e
tooo'o'o'o".

Novell's Ray Noorda was unavailable for comment.  His secretary told us
that he was busy talking to his stock broker.

Stay tuned for more details.

I just knew it was going to be another *fabulous* RIME Times contest!  Not
only are we publishing the winner's name as originally promised, but due to
popular demand we are naming *all* those that submitted an entry - all
five!

I thought sending contest entries racing through the network might mix
things up a bit and I was not disappointed.  Submitting a winning entry
took a combination of luck and skill!  All five contestants answered all
word puzzles correctly.  So, the only criteria for choosing a winner became
the date and time stamp on the message.  At the risk of telling you more
than you want to know, here are the winners:

First place with a date of 09-13-90 and a time of 17:30 goes to Bruce
Francis.  Bruce receives a life time electronic subscription to the RIME
Times AND the honorary title of "Grand RIME Puzzle Pooh Bah" for the
remainder of the year!  I am sure Bruce is very excited about this!
Persistence and strategy paid off for Bruce.  He made is post from node -
>RUNNINGA, which just happens to be the closest node to NETHUB (through
which ALL mail is routed).  He also sent the original post "return receipt"
which is what really saved him.  I had not acknowledged his first post
because I did not receive it!  Bruce was persistent enough to follow-up and
reproduced the original post AND the return receipt!  Now some may say
Aha!.... the contest was rigged!  But considering the node the post was
made from and being an astute reader of the ADMIN conference, I have
decided NOT to accuse a "mother of five" of mail tampering!

Second place goes to Robert Vostreys with a date of 09-17-90 and a time of
00:20.  Now Robert is a programming whiz (he wrote RNet, a BBS networking
program among others) and has been collecting these kinds of puzzles for
years.  He threatened to give me some more!  The puzzle took him 10 minutes
to complete (claims T. and U. slowed him down).  I don't know how you feel
about this, but this irks me no end!  I never completed the puzzle!  I bet
Roger is one of these guys that can add numbers in his head!

Third place goes to Dan Deady with a date of 09-17-90 and a time of 13:38
(darn close!).  Now Dan states he actually completed the puzzle on 09-11-90
at 15:34.  Dan's entry was obviously "equalized" by the network as it
floated around for 6 days!  Dan offered up a few of his own:
S. of the B., D. M. W.
D. D. the W. is D.
F. the Y. B. R.
100 B. of B. on the W.
F. S., I. D. G. A. D.
16 M., O. A. D. M. C. (Y. H. H. A. A. B. O. R.)
Of course I cannot get these either!  Maybe Roger has a few spare SECONDS!
Oh well, may the force by with you next time Dan.

Fourth place goes to Mike Keelon with a date of 09-20-90 and a time of
16:40.  Mike just thought it was a very enjoyable puzzle!

Fifth place goes to Gerry Stoloff with a date of 10-04-90 and a time of
09:48.  Gary thought it was a "very good puzzle although it's been
publicized".  Now he tells me!

Gerry threw in a few comments so we'll use his post for the answers:

TAGLINE OF THE MONTH:
"...DOS to DOS, disk to disk, file to file."
(As seen on a tag by David Tay submitted by Anders Horntvedt)

THE THREAD THAT LOST CONTROL:
"Let's get grammatical"
(The continuing saga of Poppycock!)

MALFUNCTION OF THE MONTH:
A sysop configuration error in which more than 100 "Adult" oriented
messages were fed into the SYSOPS conference.  Although there is concern
that Debi E. is pregnant with father unknown.... after reading all 100
messages this came as no surprise.

FAUX PAS OF THE MONTH:

Do you know of any way to run ProDoor as a BBS? (without PCB at all.) I
have heard that this can be done and it sounds great! (If it's true.)
Thanks!

2) For short articles, a routed private message in either the COMMON or the
ADMIN conference is acceptable.  Please address and route to: John Dodson,
node ->CANTINA or Ed Lazarowitz, node id ->CAPCON.

3) For long or multiple articles, an ASCII file uploaded directly to my BBS
La Cantina! (915)532-0332 HST is preferred.  Or if you are a sysop, I will
call your BBS to pick up articles.

4) Your name as used on RIME.  5) Your node id if you are a RIME sysop or
your "home" board id if you are a RIME user.  6) Any special instructions.

Thanks!
