Welcome to the November issue of RIME Times!  We are running a little
behind this month.  I think the past month has been busy for everyone,
myself included.  Funny how our real lives can be so intrusive!  In any
case, our great group of regular contributors came through again!  More top
notch articles from Doug Maclean and Jim Daily.  Skip Ross is back as
conference coordinator.  Jeff Woods is back with another humorous article.
We dug through our huge inventory of articles to find a previous submission
by James Spinelli that never made it to print.  So without further ado and
before December rolls around ...we are off to the presses!

A Happy Thanksgiving to all and we'll see you on the next relay!

In order to keep our data current and up to date we ask that
the Host/CoHost provide the following information in the following format
using as an example:

   Name Of Conference:   4$SALE
   National Number:      2        (Note National and NOT Local

WATCH.RLY turned on to aid me in the gathering of this information.  As I
carry only 181 conferences I will not be able to receive through your
conference at PGHS if your conference is not carried here.  So I ask that
you see WASHPCB instead of PGHS as the originating system for this request,
please send your response to me using Network Administration (National
Number 25) or Conference Hosts (National Number 163).  I will respond to
you in YOUR conference once your information has been received.  If you

host more than one conference, one message listing multiple conference
names and numbers will be sufficient for our data needs.

We will allow three weeks for this information to flow to PGHS. We ask that
your response be here on PGHS by November 24th, a Saturday.  Any
conferences for which there is no response we will deem to be without a
moderator (with the exception of conferences shared with other networks)
and we will review the conference further for possible Host assignment or
topic reassignment.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation in this matter.

Hi, my name is Chris Shergold.   I am 7 years old, and have been for four
years.    I have an inoperable brain tumor and I have a wish.   I'd like to
run up the largest bulk mail bill for sending the most Thank You cards, and
have this listed in the Guiness Book of World Records.

I contacted the Post Office in my home in Suffolk, UK, and they told me
that most of your cards are still in Atlanta.   I contacted the Postmaster
General in Atlanta, and he cursed me up a storm (as a seven year old, I
found many of the words he used fascinating.   I told my mother what he
said, and she called him a liar because her and daddy certainly WERE
married), and then asked me if I wanted a job with the US Postal service.
I figured that would be a good way to get my thank you cards delivered free
(at least in Atlanta) and give me something to do with my last days, since
waiting for the semi to drop off the day's mail soon got boring, and I
don't understand WHAT Geraldo or Benny Hill are
talking about on the telly.

So, here I am in Atlanta, writing thank you letters to all of you kind
folks who got me listed in Guiness the first time, and delivering them at
the same time I return your original cards to you.   Seems that the Make-A-
Wish Foundation was real mad, too, since they had to rent a couple of new
offices to hold the mail bags.    When I went by to pick up those mail bags
so I could write the thank you notes, again, the woman in charge there
cursed me up a storm, and it was real fun.   I told my father what she
called me, and he said they were all wrong about mommy.    If I'm not HER
her son, then who is the woman the worker called me the son of?   Now I'm
really confused, and I'm starting to wonder if I might have caused a few
people some brain hemorrhages to match my tumor.....

Anyway, my first day at work I managed to get 25 thank you cards written,
and matched to the original cards so that they could be returned.   The

first door I went to personally thank the people for their kindness were
rather taken aback.   "Aren't you dead" or something was how they put it.
I assured them that I was very much alive.   The man then said something
like "Well I'll be a son of a...".    So now I know who that woman the
social worker was talking about is.

I must admit, it looks like it'll take a bit longer for me to get this
record than the receiving of cards.   Hopefully the tumor won't do me in
before then.   The postmaster told me that I should receive a hefty pension
should I finish the task.     Now if I finish the job, how can the give me
a 'pension?   I'm already done, and there's nothing to s'pend me from?   So
I asked him about this, and again had to go to mommy for a translation of
what he said.

She told me that that was Daddy's job and not mine.

Anyway, I have seen all of your messages that request cards for me, and I
ask you to stop.   If you really want to help, come on down to Atlanta and
help me stuff envelopes with Thank You notes, and explain to me exactly
WHAT my father's job is...   I'm still confused.

Sincerely,

     Chris Shergold
     Guiness Book Record Holder
     Most Get Well Cards Received

Did you ever want to redirect your compiler's output to a file so you can
go over it later but still wanted to see what was going on.  Want to send
your program's output to the screen, several files and to the printer all
at once?  Here is a little program I ported from the Unix world that will
do just that.  It is called tee.exe and it is very simple to use.

                 cl myfile.c | tee errors

This command line will take the output of the MSC compiler and display it
to the screen while it is sending it to the file errors.  If you wish to
append to the file instead of creating a new file use:

                cl myfile.c | tee -a errors

If you have a makefile that compiles a lot of modules, this will let you
see what is going on while the output will be safely stored in the errors
file.  You can also use the printer instead of or with the files.

                dir | tee prn direct

will send the directory to the printer and to the file direct as well as
the screen.  Other valid "files" are lpt1:, lpt2:, com1:, com2: etc.  Here
is the code for the tee program.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <io.h>

char buf[BUFSIZ];

void main(int argc,char **argv)
{
 int fd[20], total=0, len, i, mode=0;

    if (argc > 1 && argv[1][0] == '-')
        if ((*++*++argv|' ') != 'a')
          {
               fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s [-a] [<file>]...\n",argv[0]);
               exit(1);
          }
        else
        {

BPS or BAUD?
------------

Probably the most misunderstood terminology involving Data Transfer relates
to Data speed.  Generally speaking, SERIAL Data Speed is expressed as the

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

number of bits transmitted per second (bps).  We will often hear the same
figure referred to as Baud Rate, although bps and Baud are not always
necessarily the same.

When data speed is indicated in bps, the actual number of bits per second
is specified.  However, that is not true when the speed is given in Baud.
We have already learned that data is transferred as electrical signals with
the signal being either a 0 bit or a 1 bit.  A Baud is a unit of signaling
speed that measures the total number of electrical signals transmitted
during one second-similar to the way that little glass tube in your
backyard tells you how many inches of rain have fallen per hour.

If only 1 bit is transmitted per second, the bit rate (bps) is the same as
the Baud rate.  However, with today's faster modems, typically more than 1
bit is sent in 1 signal and more than 1 signal is sent in one second.  As
an example, you may have a 2400 Baud Modem with an installed protocol that
can send data at 9600 bps if 4 bits are sent per signal.

SYNCHRONOUS or ASYNCHRONOUS Transmission
----------------------------------------
This subject tends to be a bit complicated so I'll start this month with a
brief Overview of the 2 methods and continue in more detail next month.

Actions that are done at regularly scheduled intervals are normally called
SYNCHRONOUS activities.  In the world of Communications, Synchronous means
that the Data bits are sent down the line one immediately following the
other with no delays in between.  Here's a picture of SYNCHRONOUS data
transfer (Sorry!  No Synchronous at Disney World):

                 |--------|--------|--------|--------|
           >-----| BYTE-4 | BYTE-3 | BYTE-2 | BYTE-1 |----->
                 |--------|--------|--------|--------|

On the other hand, if a delay occurs between bytes (not necessarily between
every pair of Bytes), the transfer is known as ASYNCHRONOUS. Here is
another picture of an ASYNCH transmission:

                 |--------|--------|   |--------|  |--------|
           >-----| BYTE-4 | BYTE-3 |---| BYTE-2 |--| BYTE-1 |----->
                 |--------|--------|   |--------|  |--------|

Since most Micro Computers use ASYNCHronous Data transmission, I'll move
along next month to an in-depth discussion of this method.

    seven but one died which was baptized on a half sheet of paper.

2.  I am writing the Welfare Department to say that my baby was born two
    years old.  When do I get my money?

5.  I am glad to report my husband who is missing is dead.

6.  This is my eight child.  What are you going to do about it?

7.  Please find out for certain if my husband is dead.  The man I now
    live with can't eat or do anything until he knows.

8.  I am forwarding my marriage certificate and my three children, one
    of which is a mistake as you can see.

9.  In answer to your letter, I have given birth to a son weighing ten
    pounds.  I hope this is satisfactory.

10. I am very much annoyed to find that you have branded my son
    illiterate.  This is a dirty lie, as I was married a week before he
    was born.

    any relief since then.

    an immoral life.

13. You have changed my little boy to a girl.  Will this make any
    difference?

14. I have no children as of yet, as my husband is a truck driver and
    works night and day.

15. In accordance with your instructions, I have given birth to twins in
    the enclosed envelope.

16. I want money as quick as I can get it.  I have been in bed with the
    doctor for two weeks and he doesn't do any good.  If things don't
    improve I will have to send for another doctor.

                       INTENTIONAL INTERFERENCE WITH
                           YOUR PROPERTY RIGHTS

In this issue of RIME TIMES we begin discussion of the intentional
interference with your property rights. We shall make every effort to lead
our discussion in the direction of RIME network and BBS usage, relating the
issues to an arena we are all familiar with.

Part 1: Nuisances and What to Do About Them - Just as you have a right to
freedom from interference with your personal rights, so you have a right to
freedom from interference with your property rights. You have a right to
unrestricted enjoyment and use of your real and personal property. Your
right to the "quiet enjoyment" of your property protects you not only from
trespass on it by uninvited persons but from certain things that others may
do on or with their own property that cause you undue annoyance,
inconvenience, discomfort, harm or injury. These are called "nuisances."

There are two kinds of nuisances, public and private. The difference
between then is the same on that is found throughout the law of torts: a
public nuisance is one that interferes with the interest of your entire
community (such as the RIME network), while a private nuisance is one
affecting your interest only. A typical public nuisance in the RIME
network, for example, would be someone who causes distress to the entire
network community through improper conduct, defamation, and disregard for
the network's rules, policies and guidelines so as to cause harm, injury,
annoyance, inconvenience, discomfort, etc. to the members of the network as
a whole.

A private nuisance, on the other hand, is conduct by someone that
interferes only with your freedom to enjoy the use of your property. (Of
course, while the network may pursue a public nuisance situation, each
member node can pursue a private nuisance situation.) The classic example
is the "spite fence." In a real property environment this is a fence
erected by your neighbor, on his property, to keep out sunlight and air
from your property and generally to make you feel confined and hemmed in
when there is no reason for it. A user, for example, fails to maintain
proper decorum and courtesy so as to expose you and your property to
annoyance, inconvenience, discomfort, harm or injury without justifiable
reason, that is, he/she does things that jeopardizes the stability of your
property and your enjoyment of it.

Your remedies are what you might expect. For both public and private
nuisances you and your fellow RIME members -- i.e., through the Steering
Committee -- can seek an "injunction" -- that is, a court order to prevent
someone from doing something -- ordering the offensive conduct to be

                                Page 11

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

stopped. Or you may sue for damages for the harm caused by the nuisance.
Sometimes you can seek both. Frequently you will find that local ordinances
prohibit the nuisance, so that it is worthwhile to consult the local public
prosecutor and ask him to proceed in the name of the state against the
person who is maintaining the nuisance.

Much more legislation is likely to be enacted in years to come, especially
dealing with computers and communications environments. Meanwhile, you and
you fellow RIME users have a variety of weapons to use in really
intolerable situations. You should consult an attorney in your state as to
which of these weapons to use, when and how.

Part 2: Keeping Others off Your Property - If someone comes onto your
property, i.e., your BBS, without your permission, he has committed the
tort of trespass, and you may sue him even though he does no damage
whatever to your system. As the person legally in possession, you are
entitled to the complete and unrestricted "quiet enjoyment" of your
property. The amount of the damages you will be awarded depends on the
circumstances of the case. For trespass and nothing more your damages may
be nominal, or very small, but enough to assert your rights and to warn
others not to interfere with them. However, at least as far as computer
systems are concerned in many states, the trespasser may also violate
criminal statutes and thereby face criminal penalties as well as civil
penalties. In some states, such as New York, trespass into a computer
system is considered a Class E felony, carrying a jail sentence of up to 5
years, a fine of up to $100,000, or both.

However, at least as far as your own personal rights are concerned, you
must assert your rights over your property or run the risk of losing some
of those rights. If, usually over a period of years, you fail to mention
and/or complain about trespassers, you will be considered to have
surrendered your right to the exclusive use of your own property.

In some cases you may actually lose the ownership of property entirely if
you allow others to occupy and use it as if it were their own over a period
of time. For example, if the Steering Committee of RIME failed to assert
its "ownership" of RIME for a period of time (anywhere from 2 to 5 years),
it very well may forfeit its ownership rights if, in the process, it has
allowed others to use the network as if it were their own. This is why it
is important, and why each of you should understand, that the Steering
Committee every once and awhile needs to remind us as to just who really
owns RIME and to sufficiently assert this ownership. It makes the reminder
and assertion by defining operating and usage rules, procedures, policies
and guidelines and in taking the appropriate steps to enforce them.

The same may be applied to an individual BBS. If you allow others onto your
BBS and they are free to use it as if it were their own system, you may
find, though unlikely, that you may have lost some of your rights regarding
BBS ownership and usage. (Of course, you could always simply turn it off.
But, others may complain and, perhaps, have some claim as to what is on
your BBS.) This is why it is important for you to every once and awhile
assert your ownership rights.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Part 3: The Misuse of Your Personal Property - The law provides remedies
for the intentional interruption of your right or interference with it
regarding the use of your property. The tort of "conversion" involves this
interference...as opposed to the tort of trespass.
Conversion can be conduct intended to affect your property or conduct that,
even though not intentionally wrong, is inconsistent with your right of
ownership. The purchaser of goods stolen from you or the auctioneer who
innocently sells them is also a converter, because even though he did not
know it he has interfered with your control of your property. You are
entitled to recover the value of the goods from him.  In effect, the
defendant in these cases is required to buy the goods from you at a forced
sale. This is the reason you yourself should avoid buying anything of
questionable or suspicious origin. (Think about the purchase of software
that may not actually belong to the seller.)

Other examples of conversion are -- and we'll use the example of co-sysops:
(a) Your property is "borrowed" and used without your permission; (b)
someone intentionally alters the property he is "borrowing"; (c) someone to
whom you have "loaned" your property uses it in a different way from that
upon which you had agreed. In these cases, your control of your property
has been interfered with, and you are entitled to sue for the tort of
conversion. (Also, there may be "contractual" relationships that have been
breached -- such as that of "agency.")

Part 4: Interference with Your Contractual and Business Relationships - You
have a right to freedom from interference by others with your contractual
relationships you have entered into.

If you are a well-known programmer, commissioned to develop a program for
someone, and another programmer induces the client to fire you and
commission him instead, you may sue the other programmer for interference
with your contract rights -- and sue the client for damages for breach of
his contract with you. (You are unlikely, however, to recover your actual
damages twice!) Malice or ill will need not be involved in this kind of
interference, although a purely accidental interference might result in
nominal, or very small, damages compared with the damages you might be
awarded if you persuaded the court that the defendant set out to ruin your
reputation as a programmer and succeeded.

Part 5: Fraud, Deceit and Misrepresentation - You have a right to freedom
from being improperly induced or persuaded to do something, or not to do
something, by someone's trickery. What is involved in this tort is: (a) a
conscious or knowing false statement made to you, (b) by someone who knew
the statement was false, (c) with the intention that you would rely on it,
(d) followed by your actual reliance on it and (e) your suffering as a
result. The main thing for the person suing to establish is that he was
consciously tricked and that if he had been given the correct information
he would not have acted as he did.

In this case, you should be wary when you are buying something, however,
because courts recognize the right of a salesman to "puff," or exaggerate,

within reason, the merits of his product. It might be difficult to prove
that his exaggeration amounted to fraud or misrepresentation.

In a future issue where we'll discuss what you can do if you are sued,
i.e., IF YOU ARE SUED: DEFENSES OF PRIVILEGE.

Would I cower in the darkness
 If I'd never seen the light?
Or bask so, in the sunshine
 If I'd never known the night?
And would the blooming of the lilacs
 Or the coming of the spring,
Be as wondrous as it is
 Without the winter's sting?

Would I appreciate the beauty
 If that was all I knew?
And had I never seen the lie,
 Know when words ring true?
If I'd never heard the music
 And my feet not moved to dance,
Would the silence be so deafening?
 The stillness, like a lance?

And had I never lost my way,
 And known the fear and pain,
Would I have ever found the strength
 To wander once again?
Had I not known the depths of passion,
 Nor loved with such despair,
Would I have dared to reach the heights,
 And found you waiting there?

Here are the minutes from our meeting of the weekend.

STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING
OCTOBER 13, 1990


The Steering Committee convened with four members present.  They were
Bonnie Anthony, Howard Belasco, Jim Spinelli and J. Thomas Howell.

There was some discussion on revising the Conference Rules.  A motion was
made and seconded that Dan Deady's draft of a revised Conference Rules and
Guidelines be reviewed.  It  passed.  This draft was reviewed, discussion
followed, and changes were made (enclosure (1)).  A motion was made and

seconded to accept the draft and changes as the new  RIME Conference Rules.
Passed. The rules are to take effect 12:00 Noon, Friday, October 19, 1990.

A motion was made and seconded to send John Dodson a basket of fruit in
recognition of his outstanding contribution to the RIME network and his
efforts in editing and publishing RIME Times newsletter.  Passed.

A motion was made and seconded that Jim Spinelli should be Steering
Committee Ethical Liaison for Conference Management issues.  Passed.

The Steering Committee reviewed a formal complaint made by Roger Sligar and
Lee Parsons against Ken Pangborn.  It was voted that, in light of the new
conference rules, the following disciplinary action should be taken; an
OFFICIAL WARNING should be issued by the Steering Committee to Ken
Pangborn.

The Women's Only Conference was taken under advisement by the Steering
Committee which decided the following:

     a.   "The Women's Only Conference" has been renamed "The
               Women's Invite Conference".

     b.   This conference is available by invitation only and is
               open to all.  Requests for invitations are to be
               addressed to Kathi Webster, the Conference Host at NODE
               GODFTHR.

The growth of the Network was reviewed by the Steering Committee.  Based
upon the response from the mini conference, the subject of Network growth
will be reviewed again when it reaches 750 NODES.

The Steering Committee encourages all NODES to switch to Release software.

The Steering Committee looks forward to the continued success of RIME in
its coming 4th year.

The meeting adjourned.

II.  CONFERENCE MANAGEMENT

1.  Establishing conferences.

     a.  Seven nodes--2 of which must be hubs--must agree to carry a
proposed conference.  An individual who is acceptable to the CC must be
willing to act as Conference Host before the conference can be activated.
If all conditions are met, the CC will announce the conference within 10
days.  The SC reserves the right to review all issues arising out of
conference requests.  Nodes which carry all RIME Network conferences cannot
be included in this node count.  b.  The SC reserves the right to establish
specialized conferences, such as vendor support conferences, announced
through the CC.

2.  Removal of conferences.  The CC will monitor on a monthly basis
conference activity using reports generated by the NETHUB.  Conferences
that do not meet established activity criteria will be subject to
discontinuation the CC.

3.  Conference Hosts are designated by the CC.  Conference Co-hosts can
only be assigned with the advanced consent of the CC; Conference Hosts can
only recommend and cannot appoint Co-hosts directly.

TAGLINE OF THE MONTH:
"------ Have someone READ THE DOCS to you! ------"
(Used for special occasions by Ron Simonton, host of the MegaMail
conference)

MALFUNCTION OF THE MONTH:
A MajorBBS sysop and/or MajorUTI dumps hundreds of old messages into the
net (again!).

TECHNICAL HURDLE AWARD:
(With two outstanding entries, this month is a toss-up)

After several weeks of trying Joan Widgderson gets control of her off-line
reader (we think!).  Truly a cause for celebration.  As Howard would say:
"GOOD FOR YOU!!!!! You have sent a message with a quote that does not have
the tag lines in it. GREAT!!!!!!"  Time to forge ahead and work on those
margin settings!

After several weeks of trying CHUCK (a new RIME sysop) has found his LAST
name!  It is GILMORE!

To make life easier for the editor, the following submission guidelines are
suggested:

1) To be included in the current month newsletter all articles must be
submitted by the 5th of the month.

2) For short articles, a routed private message in either the COMMON or the
ADMIN conference is acceptable.  Please address and route to: John Dodson,
node ->CANTINA or Ed Lazarowitz, node id ->CAPCON.

3) For long or multiple articles, an ASCII file uploaded directly to my BBS
La Cantina! (915)532-0332 HST is preferred.  Or if you are a sysop, I will
call your BBS to pick up articles.

4) Your name as used on RIME.  5) Your node id if you are a RIME sysop or
your "home" board id if you are a RIME user.  6) Any special instructions.

Thanks!
