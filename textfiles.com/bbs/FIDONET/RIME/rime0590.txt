Last month we looked at routine to copy a file from one place to
another.  This month we will be improving the through put and error
checking.  The increased speed is the result of replacing open and
read/write statements with fopen and fread/fwrite.  This permits us
the option of using the setvbuf statement.  This routine permits us
to set up very large buffers to minimize disk access.  In the
routine fastcopy, we set up a set of 20K buffers to expedite file
I/O.

We also use the access command to determine if the destination file
exists.  This is much faster than checking with the success of
failure of an open.

As an active member of the relay I find myself writing a lot of
messages with EZ-Reader.  I use Brief as my editor and wrote the
following macro to help with some of the mundane chores.  This
macro will automatically split the screen into a message and reply
if you are answering a message or keep one screen if you are
preparing a new message.  The macro also sets up hot keys to route
a reply based on the home board of the original message.  F2 will
route the mail and F3 will also request a return receipt.  F1 will
search for the person's name and start the reply off for you.
