 1 - EDITORS CORNER by Michael Brunk, Node ID ->CSPACE
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Welcome to the May 1991 edition of the RIME Times newsletter!  I think
you'll find this to be one of our best issues to date!  My call for
articles was met with great enthusiasm and resulted in some very good
submissions from RelayNet members.  Don't stop now though!  Keep those
entries coming in.  Route your submissions to Michael Brunk at Node ID
->CSPACE or have your sysop SEND it via the PCRelay software.

I recieved another extra special suprise this month.  Keith Personett
(Node ID ->GUILD) has written a special BBS door that will allow you to
read the RIME Times while online your favorite board!  It is called
RimeNews and is available to RelayNet sysops via file REQUEST from
->NETNODE.  While written specifically for WildCat! it will run with
other types of software using a door file converter.  I'm running it on
my Gap BBS using QKDoor to do the conversion.  There are other text
viewing doors available but this one is customized for our RIME Times
format and there is no configuration involved!  It's a very slick
product and Keith has graciously provided it at no cost to RelayNet
members!

3 - WHO IS THIS MARLOW? by John Dodson, Node ID ->CANTINA
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

[Editors Note:  It has come to our attention that many of you want to
know who this deranged individual, Myles Marlow, is.  John Dodson was
brave enough to confront him and returns with this revealing interview.]

John:  Nice place you have here Miles.

Myles: Thanks.

John:  Looks like you have a nice computer setup too.  But before we
talk about the technical aspects of Sysoping, I'd like to talk a
little about Users.

Myles: Ok.  What do you want to know?

John:  Myles, you have been a Sysop for a good many years.  Your
fellow sysops say that you have a special relationship with your
users.  Can you share some of your experience with us?  For example,
what do You think makes a good user?

Myles: We sysops have a noble duty: molding our users.  The duty to
bend and twist our users into model BBS citizens.  Into The Good User!

John: I see.  But, what exactly makes The Good User?

Myles: The Good User is a pliable user.  The Good User doesn't use the
<C>omment function unless it's in regards to an increased donation.
The Good User doesn't <P>age the sysop (unless it's in regards to
verifying the address with which to mail the increased donation).  The
Good User that wants more nodes, brings another computer and modem to
the sysop's house and leaves it. The Good User only has good things to
say about the BBS, never criticism. The Good User bad mouths other
boards and makes fun of other's systems software.

John:  How can you get Users to do all this?

Myles: Well, these things take time.  They don't happen by themselves.
Each and every Sysop bares a portion of the responsiblity.  We all
must do our parts.  And we all will benefit in the end.  Those users
have a LOT OF MONEY out there and we aren't getting nearly enough of
it.

John:  So all of us Sysops must work together to mold our Users into
Th Good User.  We must buckle down and share the responsibility?

Myles: Yes, I find it difficult to believe that we don't have a single
guideline suggesting we conduct ourselves in a Serious Sysop-like
Manner.  If we're not careful there might be a decline in yelling,
name calling, software-spitting and bellyaching. Or Worse, some of the
lily-livered sysops might even cultivate tolerance with users who
insist on acting like users!

John:  Now that's a scary thought.

Myles: Well, it won't happen on my board!  Nosirree!  I run a tight ship.
Most sysops only require a user to /read/ the policies.  MY users must
MEMORIZE and RECITE my policies.  Every night.  (I call my users, both
of them, each night.)

They recite,  "Hello, my name is _______.  I am a User.  I recognize
and acknowledge this fact.  I am lower than dog poop..."  It takes
about ten minutes for the entire credo, but it's well worth it.

And my opening banner is equally upfront:

    "Dear User, if you come here expecting to 'USE' my board, then you
    can just turn your fat modem around and go out the port you came
    in!  USE someone else's board, you leach.  Or run your own."

It works swell.  But it's a two-way street.  In return, I keep open as
many nodes as it takes to guarantee a low incidence of busy signals.
So far I can't imagine needing more than a single node.

John:  Well, that indeed is a special Sysop/User relationship.

Myles: Yes it is.  Only my most /trusted/ users have actual modem
access to my board. The newbies have to come to my house and use the
BBS from the actual console.  That way, I'm assured that they won't
take any files or anything when I'm not looking.  After a few months,
if they've been REAL good.  I let them call in remotely.  But ONLY at
300 baud. Even the best of them, get greedy at those higher speeds.

John:  So you do have some problem Users.  How do you handle them?

Myles: I have a REAL sysop's chair.  I mean a real SySop (Brand)
Sysop's Chair.  The kind with the twit button hot-keyed to the
arm-rest. They're great!  I got the deluxe model--The SuperTwit.  It
has this hair trigger that's activated by the slightest elbow
pressure.  Man, I tell you, this is really living.  I just sit here,
wait for a logon, and POW --  another user drops carrier.

John:  Isn't that a little abusive Myles?  How can you get away with
it?

Myles: For too long the Users have made Monkeys of us sysops! They've
played us against each other.  They've acted like if we didn't do
things Their Way they'd take their BBSing somewhere else.  Well, I
say: ENOUGH!  Let's blackball those good for nothing leaches that log
on to our computers.  We can show 'em.  We'll disconnect our modems!
HAHAHAHA!  That'll fix their little red wagons! ... Say ....I can see
one of my two users right now.  He's got his nose pressed up against
the window pane and he's saying something.  The little jerk.  Excuse
me a second, John, while I deal with him.  "Get outta here you little
leach!  Go call CompuServe!"  Okay, he's gone.  Now, where was I?  Wait
a minute... he's up on my roof.  He's messing with my electrical
service!  He's &*%$#}}~}_}~~} pzzzzzzzt!

John: Sorry about the computer Myles.

4 - BLIPVERTS by Mike Gunderloy, Node ID ->ALBANY
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

[Editor's Note:  These reviews are reprinted from FACTSHEET FIVE]

COMPUSER v.2.50 (CUSER250.EXE; subscription $30/3 issues per year from
Unicorn Software Limited, PO Box 911, Wabash, IN 46992-0911): This is a
specialized database aimed at those who are interested in shareware. It
contains entries for distributors, BBSs, computer clubs, newsletters,
authors and a few other categories and, in a daring move, Unicorn rates
them on size and performance (precautions are taken to make sure people
can't change their own rating on shareware copies). The program can
search on everything from Zip code to type of entry and print mailing
labels and postcards in addition to displaying the information on
screen. The entries are updated every 120 days, and for $30 you'll get
three issues a year, with instructions on how to merge them without
losing your own entries. (IBM)[ASP]

CROSSWORD CREATOR v.4.3 (CWC.ZIP; registration $20 from PC Help-Line,
35250 Silver Leaf Circle, Yucaipa, CA 92399): At its simplest, you can
think of Crossword Creator as a text editor to allow you to type across
and down, with a separate window for editing a list of clues. But
there's a lot more than that here, as the program also includes several
intelligent features to aid you in placing words, including a "robot"
mode that will take a list of words and turn them into a puzzle. The
program has extensive mouse support, and works with a wide variety of
printers, allowing even dopes like me to make their own crossword
puzzles. (IBM)[ASP]

LITE FORMAT v.1.20 (LTFORMAT.ZIP; registration $14.95 from Falk Data
Systems, 5322 Rockwood Ct., El Paso, TX 79932): This package contains
two stand alone utilities from Falk's larger EZFORMAT package. FORMATF
is an alternative to the DOS FORMAT program that is smaller, smarter,
more flexible and faster, while DVFORMAT provides the same services in a
Desqview-aware background task.On top of all those advantages, these
programs are more reliable, not accepting marginal disk sectors that DOS
will mark as good. And as an added bonus, the documentation will teach
you quite a bit about disk formatting. As bombproof and useful a piece
of shareware as I've seen. (IBM)[ASP]

                 FIGHTING TIME

Wake up in a daze, bleary eyes, squint . . . a CLOCK.
Fighting through the waves . . .
of sleep, that still cloud my mind.
No time for that.  Rush, Rush, Bustle Bump.
Beat the Clock!  Punch the ClocK!  Race the CLOCK!
My battery stopped!  Watch the CLOCK!
It stopped ticking, Time.

Race here. Race there.  Hurry, hurry,
you'll not make it in time.  No time for this.
If I'm late for this, I can be on time for that;
or was it, get to that so I can make it to this.
A protest of time just makes me later,
But why is it such a crime to take some?
I need some for me, but that wouldn't do,
for if I have some, that means there won't be any
left, ..... for YOU!

6 - ANATOMY OF A TAGLINE by Dave Schubert, Node ID ->CASINO
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

What are these "Node IDs" and "Taglines" we all hear so much about?
Why, a useful part of each message on RelayNet, that's what!  At the
end of each message that travels through the network the following
information is appended:

                        +- Serial Number
    Node ID ----+       !              +---- Network Information
                !       !              !

    !                  Customizable BBS Information
    !
    +- Software Version Number

With this resource at your finger tips you can readily find out where
in the world the message author is entering his message and the Node ID
needed to route a message directly to the board he uses.  Most sysops
include their BBS info in the customizable field so you can normally
find out the number if you needed to dial direct for some reason.

7 - FRACTALS AND THE TEXTURE OF OUR WORLD by Pete Longo, Node ID ->IDEALS
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

"Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not
circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a
straight line."

                                              Benoit Mandelbrot
                                   THE FRACTAL GEOMETRY OF NATURE



Mandelbrot's words seem so obvious they set us to wondering who could
doubt them. Still, it took over 2000 years for us to embody these
ubiquitous features of the world in our geometry. Before Mandelbrot
all the geometric models of our everyday world were based on
Euclidean geometry. True, in the 19th century Lobachevski and Bolyai
discovered "alternative geometries", but for all there novelty these
geometries sprang from only slightly different interpretations of a
single Euclidean axiom. Somehow, the intrinsic textural complexity of
nature continued to elude us: our mathematical, scientific, and even
artistic models of the world still consisted of spheres, cones,
circles, and lines.

Mandelbrot coined the term "fractal" in order to give a name to the
new objects and mathematics he forged.  Stemming from the Latin
adjective "fractus", a word which denoted irregular fragmentation, or
the quality of being broken into many small pieces, Mandelbrot
loosely defined a fractal as an object which had a dimension that lay
between the Euclidean dimensions of our everyday experience. Thus,
fractals may often have "fractional" dimensions. For example, many
forms of fractal "dusts" have dimensions between 0 and 1; most forms
of fractal curves have dimensions between 1 and 2; and, many fractal
surfaces have dimensions between 2 and 3. There are fractals in
higher dimensions too.

What does it mean to say an object has a dimension *in between* the
Euclidean dimensions of breadth, depth, and height with which we are
all familiar? Let's consider a fractal curve and see if we can ply
our intuition concerning these new objects.

When we think of a two dimensional object we naturally visualize a
plane surface. We might also envision a plane as a flat surface ruled
with a grid; at the center of each cell of the grid is one of the
points of the plane. Let the grid slowly disappear until you are left
with a surface composed of points. Now, if you choose to draw a line
on this surface any curve you choose to draw will start at some
point, go through a number of points, and stop at some other point;
there will be at least one point through which the line does not
pass. I said *any* curve you choose to draw will have these features,
but is this true? As it turns out, it isn't. There are some curves
which are so complicated that they cover the entire plane, in fact
they are so convoluted that they make one continuous line that passes
through *every* point on the surface, and that line never passes
through itself.

What are we to say about such curves? On the one hand, they are 1
dimensional objects since they are lines. On the other hand, they
completely fill a plane surface, so they would seem to be 2
dimensional objects. In large measure fractal geometry serves to
answer this question. The answer it gives is that such curves may
have dimensions that reside between 1 and 2.
   
At this point you may be wondering, "How do we draw these strange
curves?" In order to answer this we need to consider another freature
of fractals: self-similarity. We can find examples of self-similarity
in our day-to-day world, but of course mathematicians have a somewhat
different meaning for it. For example, if we look at a cauliflower we
notice that the entire cauliflower is composed of many pieces, and
that each piece is a miniature replica of the whole cauliflower. If
we break off a large chunk of the cauliflower, that chunk looks like
the entire cauliflower; if we break that chunk in two, each of the
pieces once again looks like the whole cauliflower. In fact we can go
on breaking pieces off the cauliflower until we have quite small
pieces and *still* those pieces look like the whole cauliflower. This
is what we shall call "self-similarity across different scalings". In
other words, each piece of a cauliflower resembles the entire
cauliflower over a large range of sizes: as the size of each piece
diminishes, the resemblance to the whole remains constant.

Mathematicians like to think about infinity, and so it is natural for
them to think about abstract objects that possess self-similarity over
all scalings right down to the infinitesimal. And this is precisely
what they do when they think about the monstrously meandering curves
that fill the plane. If you have a copy of the public domain fractal
exploration program called FRACTINT, then you can observe the
creation of many diffent types of plane filling curves in the
L-systems module. With this, you can iterate a curve from its
initiator up to the limit of your computer's graphic capabilities. If
you do not have a copy of FRACTINT, you should get one soon, but in
the mean time we'll examine the first few steps in the iteration of a
fractal object called a Koch Curve.

Iteration is nothing more than the process of performing the same
action or procedure over and over again. For example, you might
decide to apply the procedure called "halving" to a number. So you
might start with 2, apply the procedure of halving, and get the
result 1, apply the procedure again, and get the result 1/2.  Suppose
you keep doing this, iterating this procedure 100 times, 10000 time,
100000000 times, an infinite number of times, what will you get at
the end? In this case, you'll get an extraordinarily tiny number
since your patience will be exhausted long before you are even close
to the number 0, toward which your iterations ineluctably proceed.
Nothing remarkable about that. What is remarkable, though, is that
this same procedure of iteration can in many cases produce novel and
unexpected results. In addition, the simple, even boring, process of
iteration can be carried out with very simple objects, but the result
will be the creation of unpredictable, beautiful, and highly involved
structures. From simple origins, extreme complexity may come. This is
one of the lessons fractals teach us.

In order to make our Koch Curve we are going to start with the
simplest possible initiator which is a straight line segment of any
length we choose. We shall build the curve by replacing each segment
of initiator by a "generator". Finally, we shall iterate the process
of replacement. A few pictures will make this clear.


.......................................  The initiator


                   / \
                 /     \
               /         \
............./             \.............


The generator is a curve produced by removing the middle third of the
intiator, and replacing it with two line segments each equal to one
third the length of the initiator. This makes an equilateral triangle
at the middle of the initiator. We now have 4 line segments each 1/3
the length of the initiator




                          /\
                  ....../    \......
                  \               /
                    \           /
        /\          /           \          /\
....../    \....../               \....../    \......



The second iteration of the generator replaces the middle third of
each line segment from the first iteration with two line segments of
equal length. Now we have 16 line segments each 1/9 the length of the
initiator.
                                                                                                
Notice that in principle, if not on our computer monitors, we can
carry this process on indefinitely. Notice also that each successive
curve is the result of replacing each line segment with a *scaled
down* version of the generator. So, no matter how many iterations
we do, no matter how small the individual line segments become, any
given 4 segment section of the Koch Curve will be similar (in fact in
this case it will be identical) to any other 4 segment section, and
this will be true no matter how big or small of a 4 segment section
we choose to examine. As our cauliflower exemplified earlier, the
Koch curve is composed of smaller and smaller pieces that resemble
the whole curve.  As the number of line segments increase the
overall length of the curve increases. As we continue to iterate and
the length of our line segments approaches zero, the length of the
curve becomes infinite. An important distinction to remember, though,
is that a real object such as our cauliflower will never contain an
infinite fractal curve, although objects in nature may embody fractal
characteristics over several orders of magnitude.

We now have a fractal object to contemplate, what is its dimension?
It's made entirely of line segments, yet it wanders over the surface
of the plane filling it. Suppose we call the initiator L and set it
equal to 1; thus L(1) = 1. Next we apply our generator for the first
time, and this yields a curve composed of 4 line segments, each of a
length 1/3; this gives us a curve with an overall length of 4/3.
Hence L(1/3) = 4/3  After our second iteration we have 16 segments,
each of a length 1/9; and, this gives us a curve that has grown in
length by (4/3)^2. So, L(1/9) = 16/9.

Thus, the length of our fractal curve will equal (4/3)^n at the n-th
iteration of the generator; or, L() = (4/3)^n.

After some algebra, we know that L() = ^1-D, where D is an
dimensional exponent. After a bit more algebra we see that,
D = log4/log3 ÷ 1.2628. So, the dimension of our Koch curve lies
between 1 and 2: it is a fractal dimension.

If you let your computer iterate and display the Koch curve you'll
see that after a short time the curve takes on an extremely crinkled
appearance. It is easy to make a Koch Snowflake by closing the Koch
curve. It is also possible to start with different types of
generators, although the generator we used is the simplest.  Unike
Euclidean objects which are perfectly smooth, the Koch curve is
extremely rough or serrated. The fractal curve exhibits
self-similarity over a continuum of scales, and the dimension of our
curve falls in between the standard Euclidean dimensions. Finally,
the construction of this highly reticulated object is accomplished by
repeating a very simple process many times.  In this way, we can
begin to do what Euclid and those who followed him could not, we can
model objects in nature as they really are: billowing clouds, rough
tree bark, the wandering course of rivers, the growth of frost on a
window pane, and the turbulence of a wave crashing against the shore.

8 - PROGRAMMING:  IS IT MAGIC?  by Robert Bouge, Node ID ->IBMNET
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

     "Magicians can do more by means of faith than physicians by
the truth."
                         - Giordano Bruno, The Heroic Enthusiasts

     In computers, programming is seen as a black magic wielded
by hackers, and computer science majors.  A magic done in those
dark halls (Most programmers I've seen are nocturnal by nature.)
of the Data Processing or Information Systems department.
     The problem with this perception is that programming is not
magic.  It is not a secret art known by only a few.  Programming
is a process that people have been doing for thousands of years,
with a new twist.
     Everyday we set about a plan, a series of steps, which will
lead us to our desired goal.  We get in our cars of a morning and
set about a course of events which will lead us to work.  And in
almost every minute their after we are working on some plan to
bring about a desired result.  Whether it be a paycheck, or
friends with our employees, whatever it is we set our minds on we
invoke a plan to reach that goal.
     Programming is simply setting these series of steps out in a
form which the computer will understand.  Computers don't have
the ability to make up their own minds, to decide what they want
to do.  So we must do that for them in the form of a program.  It
is our jobs to provide the same direction we use ourselves to the
computer.
     Obviously, we can't ask the computer to drive us home or to
make friends with our coworkers but it can help bring our pay-
checks home easier by making our work less taxing.
     Should you decide that programming is something you would
like to try you will need to pick a language to use.  Since there
are many different languages you may find this a perplexing
question, in fact it is a subject of constant discussion between
professional programmers.
     Each programming language was designed for different skill
levels and uses.  C, for instance, is designed for professional
system programmers who need a great deal of flexibility in their
work.  Since it was designed for professional programmers it does
not lend itself very well to new programmers, however, a similar
language Pascal was specifically designed to train programmers
and thus makes a good choice for a first language.  (I say first
since even many hobbyist programmers learn more than one lan-
guage.)
     Pascal was designed to teach new programmers some of the
finer points of programming by placing them in a rigid structure
in which the compiler could enforce many of the programming
habits that were being taught.  Since Pascal was a teaching
language it does well for those who might consider a great deal
of programming but some people find it to overbearing for casual
use.
     Most people chose to work with BASIC, partially because it
is shipped with every DOS machine.  BASIC, Beginners All-Purpose
Symbolic Instruction Code, was designed for beginning programmers
who did not want to deal with some of the more complex and
frustrating aspects of programming.  As a result BASIC became a
very good language for those who did not need to program every
day but did need to work on a few things and produce an outcome
very quickly.  As BASIC became more popular, even with
professional programmers who needed things done quickly, people
came up with the idea of a even more simple language.
     The newer simpler languages, called 4GLs (Fourth Generation
Languages, as apposed to third generation languages such as
BASIC, Pascal, and C) were to bring new productivity to a indus-
try which could not (and can not) keep up with current demand.
For the most part these languages have not become much of a
reality yet.  But the few languages that do exist are wonderful
learning experiences since they take care of most of the little
things that you are likely to forget.
     Your first adventures in programming will be interesting, I
wish you luck if you do desire to pursue programming as a hobby.
And if I can help you in any way please let me know.  I can be
reached via Programming or C Programming conferences on RIME.  I
also read Common but if you are going to send via Common please
make your messages receiver only routed messages (route to
IBMNET).  Have faith in yourself and the magic will reveal
itself.

Virginia for just over four years.  The BBS supports two nodes using
PCBoard 14.5 on a Lantastic network.  Node 1 is (206)471-3360, maximum
of 2400 baud and Node 2 is (206)471-0736 answering with a US Robotics
HST.  Jim has over 1 gigabyte of storage space.

The Computer Forum specializes in Ham radio and electronics files.  It
also has a large selection for the Apple Macintosh.  A primary of focus
on this BBS is network mail, with 243 RelayNet conferences available
online or via several mail doors.  Conferences from RaceNet, a network
concentrating on motor sports, are also available.  Guest access is
free on The Computer Forum with enhanced access available via donation.

Jim became interested in telecommunications in the 1978-79 time frame
when he recieved his Ham radio license (Call: KF4GL) and began
experimenting with packet radio using a Commodore C64 computer.  He is
currently a Senior Field Engineer in charge of communications equipment
for a large banking corporate.  He credits his interest in Ham radio
and BBSing/computers for the direction his career took.
