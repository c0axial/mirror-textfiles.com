Is it June already?!  Where has the year gone?  This issue is a bit
late primarily due to problems with my own BBS this last week.  I was
finally able to wrestle it to a deadlock and it seems to be ok now
(knock on wood) allowing me to get to this NEXT project on what seems
to be an endless list!  This issue is somewhat sparse compared to our
last, let's get some articles rolling in people!  I'd *LOVE* to get
some 'regulars' lined up so if you have ANY kind of idea for a
monthly column please drop me a line!


And now... on with the show!

[Editor's Note:  These reviews are reprinted from FACTSHEET FIVE]

CALENDAR MATE v4.0 (Shareware version CALMATE4.ZIP; registration
$25 from Hawk Software, PO Box 3961, Regina, SK, S4T 3R9,
CANADA): Unlike most other calendar programs, this one is
oriented towards printed versions instead of on-screen reminders.
It has a full set of features for constructing calendars,
including flexible dating ("Fourth Wednesday of every month", for
example, or "Tue-Fri") and easy viewing of appointments already
set up. But after that you can get daily, monthly and yearly
calendars hot off the press, so to speak. Includes laser printer
support. Friendly and easy to use. (IBM)[ASP]

DAYMASTER v. 3.50 (Shareware version DAYM350A.EXE; registration
$20 from Unicorn Software Limited, PO Box 911, Wabash, IN
46692-0911): This is a program designed to be run in your
autoexec.bat file once a day. It combines two functions: trivia
program and appointment book. Shipped with a database of 2500
historical events, DayMaster also lets you put in your own
reminder entries, so your dentist's appointment can share the
same screen with Ty Cobb's birthday and the signing of the
Declaration of Independence. The display is somewhat
minimalistic, but functional. (IBM)[ASP]

DISKLIST v. 2.10 (Shareware version DISKLS21.ZIP;
registration $25 from Gulf Sierra, 14809 Clavel St., Rockville,
MD 20853-1543): This is a slick little utility program to help
you keep track of what's on floppy disks. Using either standard
character printers or laser printers, it produces a list of what
it on a diskette. You can get the final lists sized to 5 1/4" or
3 1/2" disks, get one to six columns of names, get borders or no
borders, or get a list of the contents of archive files on the
diskette. No muss, no fuss, nice simple interface and it beats
the hell out of handwriting your own labels. (IBM)[ASP]

EM KLONDIKE, EM PYRAMID and EM POKER SOLITAIRE (Shareware
versions KLONDK3.EXE, PYRSOL20.EXE and PYRMID10.EXE;
registration $20 each from EM Software, PO Box 2052, Stn. A,
Champaign, IL 61825-2052): A trio of excellent card games for use
with an EGA monitor and a mouse. (You can use the keyboard but I
wouldn't really recommend it). THe graphics here are simply
stunning, better than on many VGA games I have seen, and the
attention to detail, with undo commands, on-line help, changeable
card backs and so on is also great. Very fine implementations of
solitaire games that are beautiful to watch as well as fun to
play. (IBM)[ASP]

INCONTEXT v. 1.00 (Shareware version INCXT100.ZIP; registration
$64 from Rams' Island Software, 8 Grand Pl., Newtown, CT 06470):
Most DOS shells are not a great advance over the stark beauty of
the DOS prompt itself, since they don't add anything to the basic
functionality of DOS. InContext is different, being a full-blown
implementation of object-oriented operation atop a DOS context.
You can select groups of files by extension, and perform
extension-specific operations on some or all of them. It moves
smoothly between directories, and provides calendar management
and a task list, remembering interrupted tasks and staying ready
to resume them. There's a full-bodied macro language for
designing your own actions or customizing the work environment.
Add in the hypertext-based help system and on-disk manual, and
the result is a truly flexible and worthwhile environment to work
within. A very impressive package. (IBM)[ASP]

KEY TO THE MOUSE release A (Shareware version K2ROD.ZIP; registration
$20 from Andrew M. Saucci, Jr., 641 Koelbel Ct., Baldwin, NY
11510-3915): This program implements a simple but clever idea to add
some mouse control to almost any program. It allows you to use
environment variables to define strings for each of the mouse keys to
stuff into the keyboard buffer, and to call a particular program while
doing so. For example, you can set up your file browser to let the mouse
keys move you up and down, or use the left for Escape and the right for
Enter in your database. The program is easy to use, leaves memory
gracefully when it's finished, and seems to work flawlessly. (IBM)[ASP]

PCCLOCK v.2.14 (Shareware version PCCLK214.ZIP;
registration $10 from Michael J. Sadaway, Box 128-P, South
Walpole, MA 02071): Well, you don't need to worry about getting
the right time any more on your PC if you have this program. At
the touch of a function key it uses your modem to dial up the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (formerly NBS) and
grab the time from their atomic clock. The program also includes
a built-in digital screenclock, with all sorts of fancy color
settings as well as chimes and an alarm. (IBM)[ASP]

PERUSE v.1.11 (Freeware version PERUSE1.EXE and PERUSE2.EXE; disk
available for $11 from Falk Data Systems, 5322 Rockwood Ct., El Paso, TX
79932-2412): This is a minor update, reflecting mainly polishing to the
documentation and on-line help. PERUSE is a file reader, but it's a
great one, which can load memory resident, search and print files or
pieces of files, work in hex or ASCII, and interact with your mouse. It
also supports a pop-up DOS shell, which can be very handy. (IBM)[ASP]

PICTURE PUZZLE v.1.2 (Shareware version PPUZZ12.ZIP;
registration $17 from Software Creations, 26 Harris St., Clinton,
MA 01510): This is quite simply one of the best new games for the
PC I have seen come down the pike in a long time. The basic idea
is pretty simple: take a picture, scramble it on the screen, and
let the user reassemble it by swapping pairs of pieces. Where
this program shines is in the attention to detail. You can change
the number of puzzle pieces (making the same game suitable for
ages 5 to 95), the color of the grid, the sounds, and more. You
can use .GIF or .PCX pictures as well as the game's own .PUZ
format. You can save puzzles in progress or get on-screen help
for those tough pieces. On top of all this, the puzzles the have
available are top-notch, with several extra collections also for
sale. Dangerously addictive fun. (IBM)

THE POOL MANAGER v.2.0 (Shareware version POOL.ZIP;
registration $25 from American Systems, PO Box 604, LaGrange, IL
60525-0604): This is a program to let you run your office
football pool (or other sports pool, although the NFL roster is
built in) without being accused of mopery and dopery or having to
learn higher math. It starts out by asking for a schedule and a
list of picks, and from there all you have to do is put in the
results. It features customizable reports, different options for
breaking ties, statistics by the week and by the season, and
more. A well-done piece of specialized software. (IBM)[ASP]

SWIMBASE v.1.20 (Shareware version SWIMDB12.ZIP;
registration $49 from Words to Go, 2710 Apple Way, Dunkirk, MD
20754-9705): A specialized, menu-driven database for those who
need to run or keep track of the results of swim meets. It
follows the USS (United States Swimming) rules for event names,
age groups and scoring. It stores personal data on the swimmers
too, so you can print rosters, address lists or mailing labels,
as well as reports on the meets. Plus, it's flashy enough that
you can probably convince one of the swimmers to do all the work
if you're the coach. (IBM)[ASP]

WinEdit v. 1.1A (Shareware version WINEDIT.ZIP;
registration $59.95 from Wilson WindowWare, 2701 California Ave.
SW #212, Seattle, WA 98116): This is a full-featured text editor
designed for use with the Windows environment. It is intended
mainly as a programmer's editor, supporting files up to 16MB
long. It also allows you to proceed through the compile/link
cycle from within the editor, calling your external programs and
reporting the error messages back, even jumping to the correct
line of code to fix them. It is reasonably fast and will hope
between multiple open files with ease. About the only problem I
had was that some of their icons were too cutesy to be
immediately obvious, but there is also a full menu system to get
to everything. (IBM)[ASP]
 
WinZip v. 1.00A (Shareware version WINZIP.ZIP;
registration $29 from Nico Mak, PO Box 919, Bristol, CT
06011-0919): This is a shell program designed to help run the
popular PKZIP/PKUNZIP suite of programs under MicroSoft Windows
3.0. It features an interface that will look familiar to any
Windows user, and the ability to add and subtract files from a
.ZIP file by just selecting them. It is of course somewhat slower
than working from the raw command line, so this program is not
for power users, but the occasional user who just needs a few
zips once in a while should certainly look into it. Also
available is PMZIP, which provides the same functionality for
those using OS/2. (IBM)[ASP]

4 - INTERVIEW:	FRANK LAROSA - CREATOR OF SEARCHLIGHT BBS SOFTWARE
				 by Inez Harrison, Node ID ->MOONDOG
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

     When I was first introduced to Frank LaRosa last year, I smiled
     and said hello as one does upon meeting a stranger but after
     learning that he was the brain behind Searchlight Software
     ("SLBBS") I took more of an interest.  So this was the face
     behind the SLBBS software that I had been seeing everywhere.

     Frank LaRosa is 25 years old, single, born in Queens, and
     living StonyBrook.

     On with the interview!

     Q:  Tell us exactly what SLBBS is and how it all started?

        Searchlight is a bulletin board program: the software that
        enables you to turn turn your computer into a BBS system.
        Searchlight started in 1985.  I had just gotten a modem for
        my TRS-80 (1200 baud was the top speed in those days) and
        enjoyed it so much, I decided to open my own board. Back
        then, there wasn't much BBS software you could buy, and what
        there was, wasn't too impressive in my opinion, so I decided
        I'd have a go at writing my own program.  The first version
        of Searchlight was written in BASIC and ran on a 48K TRS-80
        Model III with two 180K floppy drives.  It ran for about 2
        years in more or less the same configuration (more floppy
        drives were added later) until I rewrote the program in
        Turbo Pascal and switched to a PC in 1987.  A few copies of
        Searchlight were sold to local Sysops in 1987 but it didn't
        become well known until the first shareware version it was
        released in '88.

        The basic concept behind SLBBS is to design a remote bulletin board
        system that uses the kind of interface you'd expect to find in any
        modern PC program. Other BBS programs, no matter how sophisticated the
        are internally, rely on simple line-oriented input and output.
        Searchlight broke that mold by becoming one of the first systems with
        built in full screen editing, and the only system with screen oriented
        option field editing and Lotus 1-2-3 style menu bars.

        (Searchlight has a UTI driver now which supports PC Relay,
         as well as FIDOnet.)

     Q: What was developing SLBBS like and how much time was devoted to it:

     A: Developing SLBBS required a strong devotion to the product
        because it took almost a year of programming time before I
        began to see any income from the product. Fortunately, I had
        the time and energy necessary to do it.

        Like most software projects, developing SLBBS is a cycle between writing
        code and listening to user feedback, comments and bug reports. The
        unique aspect of writing a BBS program, though, is that the feedback
        comes in almost instantaneously over my BBS, which allows me to test new
        features and respond to problems very quickly.

        Searchlight has consumed the majority of my programming time since I
        started the IBM version in 1987, and that includes countless
        midnight-oil sessions. I don't even want to estimate the number of hours
        I put into Searchlight because if I did, it would probably turn out that
        I made 37 cents an hour for all that time! Many people don't realize
        that Searchlight is my full time occupation but it is, and has been for
        over 2 years.


     Q: What does it give (in your opinion) that others do not?

     A: A great user interface including full screen editors, and a powerful
        conferencing system. Also good support: a company that has a vision and
        a record for improving our product year after year. You won't have to
        switch products a year from now because we didn't keep up with the
        latest developments.


     Q: I've noticed many new BBS/Sysop's start out using SLBBS.
        Any insite as to why?

     A: I think it's a combination of things.  For one, Searchlight is very easy
        to use and install.  It's also smaller to download than many other
        programs, which may attract people who download the shareware copy from
        BBS, and less expensive to register.

        I think new users who take the time to compare Searchlight to other
        products really get an opportunity to see its superior features.
        Inevitably, anyone who gets involved in bulletin boards tends to favor
        the first program they encounter, and that may be why those who have used
        a different BBS program are reluctant to give Searchlight a try.

        All kinds of Sysops use SLBBS. I think I attract a lot of the younger
        sysops and hobbyist sysops, probably because of Searchlight's low price
        It's really too bad that others get the wrong impression of SLBBS from
        its price tag, because Searchlight equals or surpasses products that
        cost, in some cases, 5 or 10 times its price.

     Q: How successful has SLBBS been?

     A: I've been delighted at its success and at the positive comments I receive
        from so many users.  I started Searchlight Software with basically no
        money and have built the company up into a successful full time business
        totally on the strength of Searchlight BBS sales, and in a suprisingly
        short time.  Now I've reached the point where I can begin spending money
        on advertising and fancy promotional flyers just like the "big boys" do.
        Searchlight is probably the number 3 product in its class, but it's right
        to that level over a lot of software that never made it very far.  I'm
        committed to having Searchlight reach the #1 position within 2 years.

        Not counting unregistered shareware copies, there are currently about
        1100 registered Searchlight systems out there.  I've sold copies all over
        the world, including quite a few in Australia and New Zealand.  I really
        enjoy talking with overseas Sysops, it's a great fringe benefit to my
        job.

     Q: How did you come up with the name "Searchlight"?

     A: A lot of people ask me that question, which always suprises me.
        Searchlight was the name of the school newspaper that a friend and I
        worked on during our junior and senior years in high school.  When we
        graduated, the paper folded, so we've always considered it "our" paper.
        A few years later when I started my BBS, it was the first thing that came
        to mind.  Searchlight was actually the name of my BBS itself before it
        became the name of the BBS software product.

        I'm really glad I ended up with the name Searchlight because I hate
        thinking up names for things.  In retrospect, Searchlight is really an
        excellent name for the product.  If that name hadn't come to me I might
        well have called it "Modem Electronic Services System (MESS)" or
        something equally inane.

                                End of interview

     this information with us.

5 - ONE DAY IN THE LIFE OF A SYSOP! by Malia Boaz, Node ID ->MWB
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

12:00 A.M.
        The BBS goes down for automatic maintenance.  I have watched it go
        thru it's paces a zillion times, but today I found a new Door with
        a nightly maintenance program in it and I needed to be sure that it
        doesn't hang the system up.  It did fine.  It was silly of me to
        stay up and worry.  A good 45 minutes of sleep time lost again.

4:15 A.M
        The BBS goes down for the nightly mail transfer.  I have a Telix
        script that has not caused me a moment's problem.  It has been
        very reliable and mail transfers work like a charm.  I have set
        Telix to "sound on", so that when I am awake and using the
        program, I can work in the kitchen or laundry room and hear the
        end of a d/l.  I sleep about 50 feet from the computer with 2
        doors between the room it resides in and my own, but if it
        didn't beep, I'd know it in an instant.  In my sleep, I hear the
        first beep, (I think), but the second one is too slow in coming.
        I better get up and check and make sure everything went according
        to plan.  Darn, it was the second beep I heard, transfer's fine.
        Look at that, 367 new messages.  Wonder if that guy in Maryland
        resolved his problem with his wife?  I sure would like to take a
        quick peek.

4:34 A.M.
        Just a quick peek at Men's Issues and I'll hop right back into
        bed.  It was so sad, he is divorced and his wife is moving out
        of state. He was going to hire an attorney and see if he couldn't
        get the courts to make her stay.  Well look at that 6 personal
        messages.  Since I started using SLMR, I have never  been so
        tickled, I used to have to wade through all the messages to
        find the ones addressed to me, but now, they are all separated
        and I can go through them very fast.  Here's the one I have been
        waiting for, the answer to my WP51 problem.  Two answers, both
        say to do something entirely different.  Wonder what will happen
        if I try them?  Shouldn't take but 10 minutes at the most.  Since
        getting RIME, my life at work has become alot easier.  I used to
        have to struggle with word processing problems all alone and
        wading thru some of the docs is like learning a foreign language.
        Well, this is for work, so it has to be done. If I can get these
        suggestions to work, it will save me many hours of labor later
        in the day.

6:05 A.M.
        Interesting, both suggestions work.  Great, will I impress them
        in the office tomorrow morning.  "Tomorrow morning", Heaven's,
        it's already here.  Usually set the alarm for 6:30 a.m., no sense
        in going back to bed for 15 minutes, cause as sure as I am sit-
        ting here, it will take me longer than that to just shut
        my eyes and fall asleep.  Oh well, what else is new in the mail
        packet?  That awful person is sending out a prank message.....
        Can't be a year since I paid my last dues, it was just last ....
        let me think....just before Spring Week-end, doesn't seem like
        it, but a year has gone by.....Nothing new from the  guy who is
        gone to Israel for a month, guess he's not back yet.  Oh this
        looks interesting a new Door for RIME TIMES.  Says I can d/l it
        from XXX board.  Let's see, it's early enough to still get the
        discount telephone rates.  It's the doors that drive me crazier
        faster than anything.  The users are always clamoring for
        different and more challenging ones.  Last month I spent $80
        registering that messaging utility and the door stacker was a big
        bite but it will pay for itself, easier on the harddrive.  Just
        a quick phone call and I'll d/l and configure that new door.  Give
        them all a surprise when they call today.

8:00 A.M.
        The docs make it sound so easy, just unzip the file and edit the
        small .cfg file and it should work.  Works great in local mode
        but why is it not running from remote?  Ok, Ok, Malia, calm down,
        go thru the files one more time, it just is something tiny,
        something you are overlooking.  There it is, a missing "\" .  Oh
        no, going to be late to work one more day.  My boss is gonna
        kill me.  How many times can you say "the car wouldn't start" or
        "the alarm didn't go off".  he is going to get on to me yet.
        Wish I didn't have to go to a job everyday.  I love working on the
        computer right here at home, but never have as yet heard of a BBS
        that actually MADE money.

10:10 A.M.
        One quick call home to the BBS.  The harddrive sounded a bit slow
        this morning.  I hope that door is not locking up.   Busy!  Bet
        it's Mrs. Smith playing Stackem for the hundredth time again.
        She's home most of the day, why does she always have to call when
        I need to get on.

10:50 A.M.
        Something's wrong, it's been busy too long.  BBS time is only
        30 minutes.  She would have had to get off by now.  How many times
        will this auto dialer recycle anyway?  I hope no one is trying
        to FAX in or out this morning.  I have had that darn line tied up
        for the last 45 minutes if not more.  One day there is going to be
        a real emergency here at the office and someone is going to get
        wise to the fact that I have been modeming at work using the
        line.

11:55 A.M.
        Still not able to get through, I'd better sneak home during lunch
        and see if the board isn't hung up.

12:20 P.M.
        Better check the mailbox.  It's here, it's here, the Time Door
        I ordered last month!  Great, now I can add a new option to the
        BBS.  Bet this won't take 5 minutes to install.  Needs a Brun30,
        let me see, I had a copy of that somewhere, right, it's on the
        Tape backup, glad I saved it.  Ok, so I have to bring the BBS
        down for a few minutes to get it, but it will be worth it when
        the new door goes up.  I can't believe this, it's working fine,
        was really just busy the whole time.  It's my BBS, you'd think
        I could get on it once in awhile. Oh well, at least it's OK.

1:15 P.M.
        Finished, got the Brun30.  Forgot how slow those tape backups
        are, but they sure beat the old way of inserting disks and having
        to sit right by the machine the whole time.  Getting that 210 MG
        drive was great but I can't imagine backing it up to floppies.
        Took too long getting the file, I'll have to configure the door
        later.  Better get my buns back to work NOW!

3:45 P.M.
        I can hardly keep my eyes open.  I should have slept last night
        instead of playing with that new door.  Will this day ever end?
        My family says I am addicted to the computer.  They say I never do
        anything anymore, but I am so tired at the end of the day !

5:15 P.M.
        Think I'll stop by the Computer Warehouse tonight on the way home
        and take a look at that new 386 40Mhz machine.  Everyone is raving
        about it's speed compared to the new 486.  Wonder how much it
        would set me back?  I just upgraded 4 months ago to my own 386SX
        16Mhz from the old 8088.  How come just as soon as I buy something,
        there is something else newer to replace it with.  I really wanted
        to save for the 9600 baud modem but a grand is alot of money.
        Someday!

6:45 P.M.
        21 calls today, not bad. 432 minutes used. 8 files d/l ed.  They eat
        those things faster than I can find new ones.  Just glad there are
        programmers out there making them everyday.  Oh, I missed the phone
        bill when I was home for lunch, sure hate to open up this baby.
        $122.16, not that bad, I was worried that those calls I made to
        California were going to really drive it up, but considering last
        month's bill, $200 odd dollars, this isn't bad.  Better get
        started now, Time Door waits!

8:35 P.M.
        "OK, OK, John, I'm coming".  Just when I was finally beginning to
        understand the docs with the new Time door, someone wants to page
        me.  If this guy only knew how to type.  Takes him 3 minutes a
        letter.  I could be here for hours. "What? Scan78 IS not on my
        board.  I never posted it, remember the Message I had up about it
        being a Trojan?  I was the one to tell you first.  No, I don't
        want it, don't care, keep it for yourself"  Sometimes, I wonder if
        they have any brains at all.  Last week he u/l's me 3 files all
        dated 85/86.  Who even has DOS 2.0 anymore.  Primitive files, a
        waste of my time and his.  He d/l's about 15 files a week from
        off the BBS, bet he is doing the same thing somewhere else, why
        doesn't he u/l one of those?

10:05 P.M.
        There, got both RIMENEWS and TIMEDOOR working.  What a relief.
        Thought I'd never get them configured right.  Hey, what's this?
        LivCat!!  LivCat!!!.  I was sure I checked the spelling on that
        new Main menu screen. Great!!! 5 different screens and they all
        have to be corrected. This is murder.  I talked with another
        sysop who always has such tailored screens on his BBS.  Wish I
        had the guts to capture someone else's screens and display them
        as my own.  I be afraid that one day one of them would call me
        and see what I have done.

11:30 P.M.
        There, menu screens are done, thank G-d for ANSIIDRAW, I'd hate
        to have to do this all by hand one letter at a time.  Ok, time to
        hit the sack.  Am I ever beat.  But it's so close to midnight and
        the new TIMEDOOR has a routine for the midnight maintenance, just
        30 more minutes and I can rest, assured that it cycled thru
        correctly.  BBS is ringing.... Hey, it's Sam, what a great guy,
        Sam knows everything about Computers, wonder what he thinks about
        that new 386 40Mhz I saw today, I'll just chat with him awhile
        until maintenance time.  How did this ever happen to me?  My lawn
        hasn't been mowed in 2 weeks, the house is a mess, laundry piled
        up in the back room.  What is a grocery store, I have forgotten
        what it looks like inside.  Too many pizza deliveries, All for the
        love of a computer.

11:55 P.M.
        I'll sleep this week end, after I do the backup, compress the
        drives, pack the message base, update the file folders, read and
        answer all my messages and clean house!
			Lord, give me strength!

6 - RIME RUMORS by Michael Brunk, Node ID ->CSPACE
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

[Editors Note:  We refuse to be held responsible for the following
article.  Any resemblence to actual news or factual information is
entirely coincidental.]

Anyone notice Howard acting a little strangely lately?  Reliable
sources tell us he's been so relaxed he's seen at his PC sans bowtie.
Might this indicate the rumor that he's actually been composing
11-line messages in ANSI color off-line may be true?

RIME Times is pleased to reveal that we have determined that there is
*NO* truth to the rumor that difficult connections at NetHub have
been caused by the relocation of Bonnie's server into the trunk of
her car so that she can operate it while on the New Jersey Turnpike.
This one turned out to be a false report.  Indications are it was
leaked by a high-ranked RIME official to throw RT investigators off
the REAL story.  What are they trying to hide?

PCBoard sysops are grumbling about MarkMail these days.  Apparently
trouble reports have been met with slow responses.  Could this have
something to do with the giddy grins coming from the Gap BBS camp?

Wild speculation is flying concerning the next generation networking
software that RelayNet will use.  After reading all of the
suggestions and specifications being bandied about, an RT expert
consultant concluded that the new hub will incorporate a time bending
capability and harness the power of a black hole to instantly
compress waiting mail.  If anyone can do it Kip can!

Heard a good rumor lately?  Got some info under your pillow you just
HAVE to tell someone but have been afraid to?  Did you accidently
read a message meant for someone else with some REALLY juicy tidbits
enclosed?  The rumor mongers at RIME Times want to know!  Route a
message, preferably R/O, to Michael Brunk at Node ID ->CSPACE.

7 - BE YOUR OWN PROGRAMMER by Robert Bouge, Node ID ->IBMNET
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

     One of the toughest problems, if not the toughest problem,
that a programmer has to face is understanding what it is that the
user (you) wants.
     There is talk in the computer world of the user interface
which is nothing more than what you as a user see of the program.
It does not deal with the internal workings of the program although
it conveys the results to you.  This critical piece of work is not
the end to understanding your problem nor is it the solution.
     That is what programmers as a group are charged with.  Finding
solutions to peoples problems (as they relate to computers) and
conveying that solution to the person who needs it.  The unfortu-
nate circumstance of this is that programmers necessarily need to
know a great deal about the problem, often much more than can be
easily explained.
     The explanation of a problem is the weak link.  You understand
your problem and probably know of a manual method of solving the
problem but you need to convey all of the information that you used
to come up with the manual method to allow the programmer to come
up with a computerized method, or do you?
     The information you used to make your judgement was probably
not just based on the tangible evidence at hand but by years of
experience as well.  Just as you can't teach one of your employees
your experience, you can not teach a programmer your experience.
Luckily programmers are very efficient at translating a manual
method into a method that can be computerized.
     If you already have a manual plan for dealing with a particu-
lar problem then it would definitely be to your advantage to give
that to the programmer you wish to solve your problem, it will make
your explanation time much shorter and in general leads to a more
accurate solution.  I would suggest, however, that the time savings
during the programs creation and the greater accuracy of the
program should be reason enough to create a manual plan before
going to a programmer.  (It is very important to test your manual
plan to make sure it works or else the program surely won't.)
     By generating a plan, a set of actions that the programmer can
set up within a program you have eliminated most of the interpreta-
tion of your explanation.  If the plan is detailed enough that a
person can do the job then the programmer will be able to translate
those actions into a program.  More often than not, however, a plan
or an explanation is not detailed enough to handle all of the
intricacies.  For instance, recently I was asked to correct a
transaction history report since it reported activity on inactive
accounts.  The programmer who was initially asked to write the
program was not informed to exclude inactive accounts and therefor
made no efforts to exclude them.   So as you can see subtle
problems can not always be detected by examination of a problem
from an outside source.
     Since an outside source can not very often understand all of
the intricacies to a problem and has the potential of overlooking
something that you would find important why bother giving this task
to another person to do?  Why don't you learn programming and write
your own solutions?  There are several answers but a few that
spring to mind are... 1. You don't have the time to learn program-
ming, let alone create all of the programs you need.  2. 'You
always let a tank builder build tanks if you want them to work.'
In our case, programmers are trained to write programs and to
understand some of the hidden "Gotcha"s of programming. 3. It
almost requires a different mind-set that most people are not
willing to obtain.
     So what am I saying?  How do you become your own programmer?
By eliminating part of the programmers job by providing them with
a step-by-step plan for solving the problem.  Then you don't need
to learn all of the programming languages, and the hardware, etc.
All you have to worry about is how would I solve the problem.
Solve your own problems, that is what a major part of being a
programmer is.

8 - POETRY CORNER by Inez Harrison, Node ID ->MOONDOG
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
[Editors Note:	Two poems this month, both dedicated to dad's everywhere!]

         To Dad

As far back as I can remember
You were there--
When you came home from work
My world lit up with joy--Daddy's home!

As I grew, you became my friend
I could share my accomplishments with you
And you smiled--
You were proud of everything I did
As for my sorrows and downfalls
You were the shoulder to cry on
The rock I climbed to reach the top once more
Because of you--
I have the strength to live in the world today

Life may not always have been perfect
I know you wanted the best for me
And you gave everything you could
The most important thing is--
You gave me complete and total love
And knowing that I can live without your presence

You are always in my heart, Dad
For as long as I live--
You will never completely die
You gave the world--and me--your best
And I love you for it

--Posted with love and remembrance
          Teri Brayall


A father is, so many things...
this much is shale-and-lime,
For both are soft, and used a lot
and re-main through-out all time.

Your steadfast love and wisdom have
prepared me for the trials...
Which seem to come-and-go with life,
In is an honor-to-be your child.
