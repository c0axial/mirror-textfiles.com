Welcome to the February issue of Rime Times!  As you probably know, we
skipped the January issue to give our regular contributors a break.  There
are a host of new conference announcements (sic), Doug Maclean is back with
his great tutorials on the 'C' programming language, Jim Daly with his
great communications tutorials and for our acculturation, we have a nice
selection from the poetry conference and another classic work by Jim Prohs
(Jim Prohs!? Culture!? from Nebraska!?).  In short, we have managed to come
back (most of us anyway!) with another great issue!

This will be my 13th and last issue as Editor in Chief (important sounding
title!) of Rime Times.  Actually, I cannot claim the very first Rime Times
issue as this was done by Michael Brunk.  Michael is a person whose loyalty
runs deep and he left RelayNet for a time when the regional HUB he was
relaying with broke away to form another network.  At the time, I was
apparently the only one who had volunteered to do an article, so with his
departure I got to be editor.  (Here's the newsletter John, you're the
editor, I'm leaving! <grin>)  Michael has been back for six or seven
months, doing important things like becoming a father, and has kindly been
coerced into taking his turn as Editor in Chief.  (Actually, I think this
job ought to be passed around about once a year.)  I am still going to
stick around and help out as a co-editor.  We have some other co-editors
who have volunteered (please see NOTICES).  I am excited about having some
'new blood' with new ideas on board and I hope that more of you will be
inspired to chip in too!  After all, this IS the Best Little Network in the
USA! (You guys in the Northern Hemisphere too! <grin>)

See you on the next Relay!

                         The Demise Of The Hammer!

                         Dedicated to Elaine Port

(enter sound of a boom-box playing a loud rap beat...)

It's January, nineteen hundred ninety and one,
the HAMMER makes plans for some fun.
With being single he will soon be done,
A wedding is planned with his special Hon!

Who is this bloke known as the HAMMER?
Why can he sound fresh from the slammer?
The HAMMER's been known to pack a mean punch,
His name? well, you all have a good hunch.

It's no secret he been around the block,
the HAMMER sports a head that's hard as a rock.
When he is angry dragon's fire doth fly,
In his path you don't want to lie.

Such a man in difficult to define,
Reads those messages till practically blind.
Paradoxically he is truly very kind,
while his is kicking at your behind.

With fist that can smash steel and concrete,
one of the strongest wills your likely to meet.
A voice that can shake the foundations, rattle the walls,
Is there any question that the HAMMER's got ----moxie.

It's nineteen hundred ninety one, the month of June,
The HAMMER's now whistling a different tune.
From a feeling of any PORT in a storm,
The HAMMER has from the girls been torn.
No longer is he available to toot his horn,

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

but for freedom he is not yet forlorn.

Something has changed, something is wrong!
The HAMMER is singing a very strange song.
His messages now have a laughing and happy tone.
Where O! Where is our HAMMER, we moan?
Seriously, Elaine he was only on loan!

What ever is our Bonnie to do?
We all know she needs the HAMMER too.
She's no good with the chains and the whips,
Who will handle all the trouble-making drips?

It just is not fair, it just is not right,
I enjoyed watching the HAMMER in a good fight!
What has happened to all the HAMMER's might?
Is this a case of Samson's plight?

Has the HAMMER's locks been pruned?
And his powerful voice now ruined?
Is he inside a clown suit festooned?
And has his middle again ballooned?
For the answers for this stay tuned.

It is nineteen ninety one in the fall,
Net mail is once again a ball!
I can't wait to answer the computer's call.
For the HAMMER is again riding tall.

True he can grin and have a good time,
But nothing has really changed here on RIME.
And in Elaine we have found a new friend
who makes HAMMER wounds easy to mend.

So I am sure that all's well that ends well
and Howard can now answer the wedding bell.
But not without catching a little more hell.
This must be SOME lady for whom he fell.

We extend to Howard our best wishes,
and to the bride a whole raft of kisses.
To be with the HAMMER FOR LIFE AS HIS MRS.,
wouldn't be this man's idea of heavenly blisses.

But different strokes for different folks!
And now I'd better stop with these jokes,
For I can feel my head begin to pound!
As the HAMMER my home phone hath found.

The RIME(Tm) Network is one of the oldest amateur electronic
message/conferencing system in operation in the United States. Through the
contributions of dedicated programmers and beta testers, wise beyond
comprehension Steering Committee members; tactful, infinitely patient
conference hosts and "never-say-quit" sysops; the expanding BBS calling
community, and even exploding piglets, we have helped create an
international, extended family of on-line users from all walks of life.

As with all families, RIME'S growth has not been possible without some
difficulty and challenge, as well as concern for the future of the
participants. To better cope with new problems in an ever changing
environment, it is usually wise to periodically examine one's capacity for
change, one's strengths and weaknesses, as well as, one's needs and
desires. Often, we undergo these self-examinations at the year's end in
advance of those infamous New Year's resolutions.

Well, RIME, in cooperation with Southern Illinois University, has resolved
to undertake the first-ever serious self-examination of the RIME Network.
We are undertaking a comprehensive two-part "physical".

The first part of the physical examines the Hub and Node Sysops that keep
the RIME body healthy. The second part of the physical will examine the
users that sustain the network. Through these "exams" we hope to gain a
better understanding of who/what RIME is, what we do, where we want to be
in the future.

The survey file being sent to every RIME Sysop contains questions within
ten (10) categories listed below:
     1)  Personal Demographics
     2)  RIME Sysop Experience
     3)  Computer System Information
     4)  Caller and Conference Usage Information
     5)  File Use Information
     6)  RIME Network Operations
     7)  Telephone System Data
     8)  Interconnections
     9)  RIME Network Future
    10)  Opinions

The second phase to this RIME Research Study involves BBS callers.  The
User Survey will be issued following distribution and return of the RIME
Sysop Survey. Details on the RIME User Survey will follow in a subsequent
message at a later date. If you have any suggestions for questions you
would like to see asked in the upcoming "RIME User Survey", please advise
me as soon as possible.

One of the most used Unix commands is the act command.  This stands
for concatenation.  It is primarily used to join files together but
may also be used to quickly display a text file.  Here is the code
for my port of this utility.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int nflg=0, sizbuf=BUFSIZ;
char *cmd;
void filecopy(int fd);
void qput(char c);
void qflush(void );
void usage(void );

static char qbuf[BUFSIZ], *qptr = qbuf;

void
main(argc, argv)    /* cat: concatenate files */
char **argv;
{
    int fd;

    cmd=*argv;
    if (argc > 1 && *(argv[1]) == '-' && argv[1][1])
    {
        ++argv;

PARITY & ERROR Detection
------------------------
We have already discussed the fact that Binary data is made up 1's and 0's.
PARITY is a term that is used to describe the number of 1's in a Binary
number.  If the total number of 1's is an EVEN number, then the Parity of
that Binary number is EVEN.  If the total number of 1's is an ODD number
then the Parity of that Binary number is ODD.  That seems pretty straight
forward!

A Parity Bit is used is ASYNCH communications to detect errors. The Parity
bit is created automatically by the Modem and is placed right after the
Stop bit (which is not counted when Parity is being determined!).  This
generated Parity bit can be either a 1 or a 0 depending on a couple of
considerations: the Type of Parity selected and the actual Parity of the
Binary number that is being transmitted. Let's look at a a specific Binary
number:

          |---|------------|---|
          |   |            |   |
          | 1 |   1111001  | 0 |
          |   |            |   |
          |---|------------|---|
            ^  ^----------^  ^
            |       |        |
          STOP      |      START
           BIT      |       BIT
                    7

                DATA BITS

Now then, let's say that we have set our protocol to 7-E-1 which you will
recall means, 7 Data Bits, Even Parity, and 1 Stop Bit. Count the number of
1's in the Data Bit. If you came up with 5, go to the head of the class!
Since 5 is an ODD number, the Parity bit  will need to be a 1 to keep the
Parity EVEN.  Like this:

          |---|---|------------|---|
          |   |   |            |   |
          | 1 | 1 |  1111001   | 0 |
          |   |   |            |   |
          |---|---|------------|---|
            ^   ^  ^----------^  ^
            |   |       |        |
          STOP  |       7      START
           BIT  |   DATA BITS   BIT
                |
            PARITY BIT

The Data Bit was ODD, so a 1 Parity bit is added to make the number EVEN (5
+ 1 = 6).  Incidentally, the original Data Bit could be sent without the
PARITY bit if we were set for 7-N-1 (7 Data bits, NO Parity, and 1 Stop
Bit).

So how does this all come together?  As I mentioned in a previous article,
both ends of the COMMunications link must use the same Parity (translate
that to "same" Protocol).  If you are calling a Bulletin Board and
DOWNloading a file, your computer checks each Byte as it is received.  If a
Byte is received which has the wrong Parity, an Error is detected and your
Computer sends a message back to the BBS demanding that it re-send that
messed up Byte.  You've probably seen your D/L Pause briefly while error
correction is taking place.  Using today's sophisticated File transfer
protocols, if an error is generated it is usually due to "line noise".

Next month we'll take a look at the concept of DUPLEXing.

       The House Across the Street  (Is Vacant)

The house across the street is vacant
Thought that's not fair to say
I've seen cars pull in and out of the driveway
And relatives come to visit and sometimes stay overnight
And children play in the front yard with the dog or the neighbors
So why is this house so vacant?
Isee the t.v. on inside the house

And a big family sitting down to eat dinner
Yet there is someone missing
Possibly the woman staring out the window at the skinny yellow ribbon
tied around the tree near the street...
The house across the street is vacant.

Kip Compton, author of PCRelay, as his freshman MIT project is working on a
link between RelayNet and Internet.  Internet is a group of networks which
include links to every major university and much of the private and public
scientific community as well!  Most of these systems are UNIX based.  In
addition to the technical hurdles involved, disk space at our NetHub would
need to be increased to about 2 gigabytes!

There has been talk of a RIME gathering or "RIME Convention".  Various
locations have been discussed including Las Vegas, New York, Washington DC
California.... or just having it at Bonnie's house again.  Bonnie's family
have not cast their votes.

Although this may fall the way of the rumored "DENSA" conference (for those
with IQ's of 130 and below) a HELL conference has been proposed.  The
conference would be for those RIME users who are .... shall we say,
uncooperative.  Among the rules and guidelines are:  $.25 per message for
any messages over 30 in a month. All mail is terminally out of sequence.
Answers come weeks before questions, and are randomly copied in from such
disparate conferences as the moderator feels fit, including local
"illiterate teen hacker" ones.  Quoting, when attempted, _must_ have boxes,
beeps, low-ASCII characters, and random ANSI escape leaders.  No message
will be accepted less than 81 characters wide.  Signatures must be six
lines or more.  All taglines must be the ones that originally come with the
reader package, like "Now using BLFSTYK...and loving it!"
