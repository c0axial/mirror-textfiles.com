1. Overview

CrymsonNet is an amateur network compromised of a group of strange characters
that decided that they wanted to send messages to people they don't know
everywhere from next door to across the country.  Why they were insane enough
to decide that this would be a fun thing to do, no one know, but it's not my
job to argue about it.  I just run this net.

1.1. A Basic Warning

CrymsonNet is a network promoting freedom of speech.  We greatly support the
right for people to say what they want, and to believe how they like.  In
effect, in most echos of CrymsonNet, Swearing, Radical Ideas, etc... do exhist.
Also note that currently the bulk of message traffic are between individuals
that pretty much know eachother.  Messages that may seem like insults are
actually a humored way of poking fun at friends.  One RC was already sent
running because this scared him out of the network.  But contrary to echos
like the "FLAME" echo on Fido, the participants do convey usefull info on
occasion, and is a very interesting network to be on.  Don't worry, if you're
strange, you will enjoy it here.

2. A Basic Rundown of Operations

2.1. Chain Of Command

The command structure of CrymsonNet is as follows.  Each Sysop has say in how
the net should be run, provided their wishes are within the basic purpose of
the net.  i.e. If a sysop wanted to create and echo whose purpose was to
promote illegal activities, it would be denied.  The decisions are made by an
informal/or optionally formal vote.  The medium for this is the CRYMSON_HQ
echo which each sysop is required to have.

Above the Sysop level is the Area Coordinator or Regional Coordinator.  The RC
will take care of the Regional activities such as issuing node numbers,
sending updates, and handling the LD feeds.  How expenses, etc... are handled
is up to each region to decide, though I would like to see costs evenly
distributed.

Above the RC is the Network Coordinator.  The NC has the ultimate say in what
happens.  You should consider the NC a god, sending the NC gifts and large
donations of cash.  Did I mention that I'm the NC?  <grin>
The NC has the ultimate say in what happens.  The RCs will send the nodelist
updates for their region to the NC, who will compile and redistribute to the
RCs.  Also the NC will deal with any problems that the RCs are unable to
handle.

2.1.1.  Area Coordinators

An area coordinator or Host, is essentially the same as a RC but is a way of
breaking down the distribution to seperate local calling areas in a region.
the AC has the same duties as the RC but on a smaller scale.

2.2. Distribution of Echomail & Routing

The Central point for all mail will ultimatly be 42:42/0, and will be
distributed to the regions from there.  Regions are required to pickup their
own mail, it will not be sent to them with the exception of what mail is sent
with the initial link up, and acknowledgment of being accepted into the net.

From there the mail is picked up by the Area Coordinators and sent to Local
Nodes until eventually everyone has recieved the message.

2.3. Netmail

A Netmail is a Netmail is a Netmail.  Just as long as you don't harass people
with it, or send "beg mail" i.e. Junk Mail, Commercial Adds, etc.. to every
node in the Net, we'll be happy.

2.4. Echomail

Echomail is one of the key reasons for running a network.  It is a way for a
large group of people with similar interests to exchange ideas & information.
Unfortunately there is the problem of dealing with troublemakers, so a policy
has to be made to also cover this.

2.4.1. Moderators

There will be no set way of moderating an echomail conference.  And echo may
have one Moderator, a group, or as of this document, be self moderated.
One major importance here is that the moderators be lenient.  One of the
things about FidoNet is that in most echos, you get jumped all over for going,
(OH MY GHOD!) "Off-Topic".  While it is good to keep talking somewhat about
the topic of the echo.  It should not be so strict.

2.4.1.1. Single or Group Moderators

Since these are quite similar in nature, they will be grouped together.  In
this instance, and echo is kept in order by one person or a small group of
persons.  They have the say of what goes on in the echo, and decide if an
individual needs "punishment" for disorderly conduct.  It's your traditional
way of moderating an echo.

2.4.1.2. Self Moderated

This is the concept of a echo taking care of itself.  Everyone in the echo has
equal status, and takes part in keeping the echo under "control".  I don't
know if this will work well or not, so it is experimental.  If it ends up
working well, this will be one of the trends in CrymsonNet.  Moderators are not
really needed in an echo provided everyone knows what is allowed and what is
not.  

2.4.2. Rules

Every echo will have a set of Rules/guidelines, even if it is as much as "This
Echo Has No Rules".  They well remain flexible, as this Net is not meant to be
strict.

The rules will be maintained by the Moderator/s of the echo, and the RCs.  In
the case of Self moderated echos, it will just be maintained by the RCs, and
by a willing reader of the echo.

Rules will be posted monthly, bi-monthly, how ever the echo/moderator wants to
work it.

2.5. Echo Conferences (types)

To put it simply any type of echomail conference will be allowed.  Family,
Business, Science Fiction/Fantasy, Adult, Pagan, etc...

Conferences will be limited to those who may not legally participate in such
echos.  i.e. Adult Conferences are limited to 18 and older, etc...

2.6. Creating A New Conference.

To get a new conference on the CrymsonNet backbone, You must meet the
following requirements...

 1. Have a Moderator (either type)
 2. Have a set of rules made up.
 3. Have the Echomail area setup with your RC

Around this time the topic is brought up in the CRYMSON_HQ conference, and if
there seems like a demand for it, it will be put into the Next echolist, and
an announcement made through the CRYMSON_HQ conference.

This is just one example of how it could be done, but there are several actual
ways.  For instance the idea could be talked about first in CRYMSON_HQ, before
the echo exists.

2.7. Handles

Handles are allowed and encouraged on CrymsonNet.  Though we would like that
you be able to identify who a certain person is, in the event that action be
required to be taken against a certian individual.

2.8. Spam

This is CrymsonNet!  WE DO NOT EAT SPAM!!!

3. Zone Mail Hour.

Systems in CrymsonNet will be required to observe ZMH.  ZMH will coincide with
FidoNet's ZMH, as most systems that will be carrying this will also be
carrying Fido.  This is to further simplify things.

ZMH, BBSs are required to only accept Mail calls only.  No user may log on
during this time period.

4. Illegal Activities

This will NOT be tolerated on CrymsonNet!  Nuf Said.
