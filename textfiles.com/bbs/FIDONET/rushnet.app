                   ---------------------------------

      1)  A QWK based mail tosser to get the mail into your system.
          (ie. Tnet, Qnet, Mknet, etc.)

      3)  Put an account on your BBS under the name of Rush Limbaugh
          with an obscure password. Two reasons: You never know the
          Great One may need to call your BBS and also this is avoid
          any one user from having that alias on any board in the
          system!
       
        Thats it!

    Mail the application to the address below and log onto
    the Hub nearest you in the Hubs list! Please don't call
    the Host BBS unless you have a 818 area code - or have
    a problem connecting with a Hub. Thanks
