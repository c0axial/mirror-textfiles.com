                American BBS Association Purpose

The American BBS Association (ABBSA) exists to provide an umbrella advocacy
organization for BBS operators. ABBSA is organized roughly on the model used
by the Better Business Bureau.

The ABBSA National Office formerly in Birmingham, Alabama based at The MATRIX
BBS, is currently based at the Dayton BOARDWALK BBS in Dayton, Ohio. The ABBSA 
National Support Conference is available for echo from the Dayton BOARDWALK at 
no cost other than normal Long Distance charges. The Dayton BOARDWALK BBS is 
accessible at 1200-14400 baud at (513) 228-1020. The Dayton BOARDWALK BBS is a 
subscription BBS however ABBSA Sysops will be given Visiting Sysop status (90 
minutes a day and full access) at no charge.

The National ABBSA Office can also be reached via FIDO at address 1:110/750, 
through Internet at ac038@dayton.wright.edu, or via ABBSA-Net at address

The ABBSA is organized on a State basis. The National Office of the
ABBSA functions ONLY as an Advisory and Coordinating center for State
Chapters and State Chapters retain complete independence. If you are
interested in forming a State Chapter, please contact us through one of
the above channels. There are no fees or costs required for formation of
a State Chapter.

The goals of the ABBSA are simple in conception though perhaps more difficult
to carry out.

              American BBS Association Policy and Goals

1. Educate the public about the purposes, potential, and benefits of
   Electronic Communications.
2. Monitor the media for inaccurate and misleading information
   regarding BBS activity and take steps to correct such misinformation.
3. Regularly inform the media of significant events in the local BBS
   community.
4. Serve as a source of information for individuals or organizations
   seeking information about BBS.
5. Inform ABBSA member BBS of significant legislation or other actions
   which affect the BBS community.


Membership in ABBSA requires only that a BBS Sysop agree to "support the
Ethical Standards" of the ABBSA. No "enforcement" mechanism exists other
than the right of the Chairman of a State Chapter to revoke the membership
of a state BBS after consultation with other members. ABBSA Member Sysops
may elect a new Chairman of a State Chapter at any time on a majority
vote.

NO DUES OR FEES ARE REQUIRED FOR MEMBERSHIP IN ABBSA.

Every member of ABBSA may post on their BBS that they are a member of
the ABBSA and all members are strongly encouraged to post the ABBSA
Ethical Standards on their BBS as a bulletin or in some other accessible
manner.
