This guide is distributed through BBSs and information utilitiesç
under the honor system. If after using it for two weeks you findç
it worth keeping, send \$5.00 to Fido Software and you'll receiveç
a beautiful printed manual, typeset with the \TeX typsettingç
system, and printed on a mediocre dot matrix printer. Please sendç
your praises, complaints, corrections, and suggestions to theç
author, Scot Kamins, at the address above.

\heading Fido's structure \endheading

Fido is divided into three major sections--MAIN, MESSAGES,  andç
FILES. The Messages and Files sections can in turn each have upç
to 200 separate areas, each area covering a separate topic. (Mostç
Fidos have fewer than 10.) Which of these sections and areas youç
can use, and the commands you can use in each, depends on yourç
privilege level. The system operator determines what a caller'sç
privilege level is.

\subheading{Message Section} The Message Section holds messagesç
that a caller writes to another person or to anybody who cares toç
read it. A caller can make a message private so that only theç
message writer and the person specified (and the system operator)ç
can read it.  The system operator determines the length ofç
messages that callers can leave. Different types of messagesç
usually go into different message areas. 

\subheading{Files Section} The Files Section holds files that aç
caller can download. These files come from the system operatorç
and from callers (maybe you) who use special Fido commands toç
upload them. The system operator checks these files to make sureç
that they're either in the public domain or that the file'sç
copyright holder has given permission for their distribution.ç
Like messages, different types of files usually go into differentç
file areas.

Many boards have a special electronic mail (FidoNet) section. Inç
this section a caller can send a message to anyone who calls intoç
a FidoNet (or compatible) board anywhere in the world. As of thisç
writing, over 2000 FidoNet compatible boards with FidoNet inç
operation are operating in all 50 states and 17ç
countries\footnote{Please don't quote me on this; the size of theç
amateur FidoNet changes week by week; it doubled in size for theç
first four years.}.

You'll read more later about entering and editing messages,ç
uploading and downloading files, and sending and getting FidoNet.

\bigpagebreak
\heading Calling Fido \endheading

When you call a Fido board, there's a process you have to goç
through before you can start reading or entering messages orç
files. It's called the log-on procedure (because youç
electronically sign your name in the log book). Except for theç
first time you call, it only takes a few seconds. Here are theç
steps you take to call and log on:

\example
\demo{test} see if this works. \enddemo

\demo{First} Make sure your modem is turned on. Of course, it hasç
to be attached to your computer properly, and you must haveç
communications software running that works well with yourç
computer and your modem.\enddemo

\demo{Second} Dial the Fido's number. How you do this depends onç
your communication software; see the manual that came with thatç
software for details. Assuming the Fido's number isn't busy andç
that the Fido you're calling is up and running, after a fewç
seconds the word CONNECT (or something similar) will appear onç
your screen.\enddemo

\demo{Third} Wait for a few seconds. This gives Fido a chance toç
check and match your modem's baud rate--the speed your modem isç
sending and receiving information. If you get no response afterç
waiting five seconds or so, press Enter two or three times.ç
(Older Fidos with version numbers less than 12  can't tell theç
baud rate of a modem automatically.)\enddemo

\demo{Fourth} Wait for a few seconds. Read what Fido puts on yourç
screen and follow the directions\footnote{If you've waited tenç
seconds or so and nothing happens, press \return a few times;ç
older Fidos (and some other BBSs), couldn't tell your modems baudç
rate automatically, and needs you to do this to get it started.}ç
You'll see the name of the board, and probably some introductoryç
information the system operator wants you to read. Then Fido asksç
for your name.\enddemo

\demo{Fifth} Type your name\footnote{Fido lets you use names withç
one, two or three words. If you enter only one word, Fido willç
ask you for your LAST name, where you can enter zero, one or twoç
words followed by \return. This sounds awfully complicated toç
explain but it isn't.} See the comments after this list in theç
section called {\it ``About Names''}. Fido checks to make sureç
you've typed your name correctly; answering ``N\return '' for noç
lets you retype your name from scratch, and ``Y\return '' or justç
\return tells Fido you are have it right.\enddemo

After you enter ``Y\return '' or \return Fido checks to see if itç
knows who you are. If it does, it asks for your password. If not,ç
something else happens; skip to the section called {\it ``Firstç
time Log-ons.''}

\demo{Sixth} Type your password and press Enter. Fido makes sureç
you are who you say you are. If everything is OK, your log-on isç
complete. Fido might show you some notices; usually you can enterç
Control-C (or Control-K) to skip them. At any rate, Fido willç
soon present you with a deathless quotation that you can ponderç
as the Main Menu scrolls onto the screen.\enddemo
\endexample

\bigpagebreak
\heading About Names \endheading

Some system operators want you to use your real name; othersç
accept ``handles''--aliases you use instead of your real name toç
reflect some fantasy or role appropriate to the kind of Fidoç
you're calling (``The Hacker,'' ``Top Whip,'' or ``Creampuff'' toç
name some typical handles). Custom dictates what's acceptable andç
what isn't on a particular BBS. In some cases, a system operatorç
asks for your real name in a questionnaire and then allows you toç
use a handle everywhere your name would ordinarily appear on theç
board. In any case, you can sign on with whatever name you want;ç
later, you can change your name and password.

Fido requires that you give a first name; whether you give aç
middle or last name is up to you. To skip giving a last name,ç
just press Enter without typing anything else. when Fido asks forç
it You need to be consistent, however; if you sign on the firstç
time with a first and last name, you must give both each time youç
call--otherwise, Fido will think you're somebody else. Also, ifç
you give just a first name the first time you call, you can neverç
give a last name when you log on. Again, you can change all thisç
from within Fido. (See C)hange command, below.)

\bigpagebreak
\heading First Time Log-Ons \endheading

Logging on for the first time takes a little longer (andç
sometimes a lot longer) than usual. You'll be asked to choose aç
password so that only you (and the system operator) will be ableç
to read your private messages and so that nobody else can use upç
your time. (Many Fidos allow you only so much time on the systemç
per day; some Fidos charge you for the time you use.) Some Fidosç
also ask you to fill out an electronic questionnaire the firstç
time you call. 

A few Fidos are semi-private or private systems; you have to beç
approved by the system operator before you can use most of theç
system's features. Some Fidos won't let you on at all unless youç
belong to a particular company or club, or unless the systemç
operator has already enrolled you on the caller list that Fidoç
keeps.

Whatever the procedure is, the Fido you're calling will let youç
know what's up and will prompt you for the information it needs.ç
You ordinarily only have to go through this procedure the firstç
time you call a particular Fido.

\bigpagebreak
\heading Signing up--again\! \endheading

All Fidos keep track of (among other things) the date that youç
call. Most Fidos purge your name from the caller list if youç
don't call again for so many days, usually 30. So you might findç
a Fido that you infrequently call forgetting who you are. Whenç
this happens, you'll have to go through the first time log-onç
procedure again.

\bigpagebreak
\heading Choosing a Password \endheading

Your password can be up to 15 characters long. It must start withç
a letter, and it can't contain any spaces. It should be somethingç
that's meaningful to you and to no one else, or it should beç
completely meaningless. The idea is to come up with somethingç
that nobody else can use to rip off your messages or Fido time.ç
Some people like to change their passwords at least once a month.ç
(See {\it ``C)hange''}.)

\bigpagebreak
\heading The Main Menu \endheading

Fido is a menu-driven system. This means that you choose commandsç
from menus to decide what happens next. (Advanced callers canç
shut the menus off and type commands directly; see {\it ``Helpç
Levels''}, for the details.) To choose a menu command, youç
usually type a letter and then press Enter. You see the menu inç
the Main section first; here's what it looks like:

**
MAIN Section:
M)sg-Section F)ile-Section B)ulletins 
S)tatistics C)hange P)age-Operator 
L)ist-Callers A)ns-Questionnaire V)ersion 
O)utside E)xitDOS G)oodbye 
Command (?=help): 
**

You might not see all these commands if your privilege levelç
isn't high enough. (In fact, it's extremely unlikely that you'llç
see either O)utside or E)xitDOS.) Your system operator decidesç
what commands you can see; if you can see it, you can use it. 

\subheading{Privileges and such} The system operator controls whoç
can use which sections and, within sections, which commands.ç
Different system operators have different rules to determine whoç
gets to use what. System operators generally make it clear whatç
you have to do in order to get to use these ``higher order''ç
commands. If you're curious, leave a message for the systemç
operator asking about it. 

Here's what each command does, in brief. The ones that requireç
further explanation have their own detailed sections later on:

\subheading{M--Message section} This brings you to the messageç
area you last looked at on your most recent call. If this is theç
first time you've used the M command, you go to whatever messageç
area the system operator sets for first-time callers. See {\itç
``Message Section''}.

\subheading{F--Files section} This brings you to the file areaç
you last looked at on your most recent call. If this is the firstç
time you've used the F command, you go to whatever file area theç
system operator sets for first-time callers. See {\it ``Fileç
Section''}.

\subheading{B--Bulletins} Gives you a numbered list of bulletinsç
you can look at. To see a particular bulletin, type its numberç
and press Enter. The following example comes from the Ch@os boardç
in San Francisco:

**
--- Bulletins ---
1) The current ``New caller'' welcome 7 July 87
2) THE INTENT OF THIS BBS
3) PRIVACY & CENSORSHIP
4) General notes on Bulletin Boards in the ``real world''
Bulletin #: 
**

\subheading{S--Statistics) Lets you know how often you've called,ç
how much time you've got left on this call, and otherç
information. This comes up: 

**
28 Jul 87  21:12:51
                 Total   Limit   Remaining
Total Calls:       264
Your Calls:         41
Connect Time:        1      60      59
24 Hr Time Limit:          240     239
Credit:         $24.00          $24.00
**

The credit line lets you know how much credit you have in yourç
account for using FidoNet, a special feature of Fido systems thatç
lets you send electronic mail to and receive electronic mail fromç
any of over 2000 Fido systems throughout the world. See {\itç
``Sending and Receiving FidoMail''}, later in this chapter, forç
the details.

You're limited in the amount of time you can spend on the system,ç
both per call and per day. Some systems are extremely busy, andç
they might limit you to less than an hour a day.

\subheading{C--Change your setup} Lets you change your name,ç
password, help level, and system stuff (screen width and length,ç
whether your modem needs nulls, and so on): 

**
---- Personal Info ----
Name             : John Scribblemonger
Address          : Lake Woebegone Minnesota
Password         : Scribe
Help Level       : All

----- Your System -----
Number of Columns: 80
Number of Lines  : 24
``More[Y,n]''      : ON
Tab Expansion    : ON
Filler Nulls     : 0

N)ame A)ddress P)assword H)elp-Level W)idth 
L)ength M)ore T)abs F)iller-Nulls 
Command (?=help): 
**

See {\it ``Changing Caller Settings''} for details. 

\subheading{L--List callers} This command shows you the names ofç
all people currently on the caller list, the last date and timeç
they were on, and where they're from. You can also hunt for anç
individual caller's name--a great way to see if a friend usesç
this board, or to see the last time that somebody was on:

**
Name or part of name to match (CR = all): 

Scott Dean      28 Aug 87  22:12:35  Fresburg Ca
Jack Friday     06 Sep 87  09:40:53  Kathmandu Nepal
Al Taddeo       25 Aug 87  23:40:28  Burbank Ca
Ed Johnson      08 Sep 87  20:25:05  San Francisco Ca
Rob Taylor      19 Sep 87  20:41:57  Fresburg Ca
Jeff McNeal     03 Sep 87  22:38:49  Pittsburg Ca
**

\subheading{P--Page the system operator} If s/he's around andç
feeling communicative, s/he'll answer.

\subheading{A--Answer the questionnaire} Some Fido systems haveç
questionnaires on various subjects. Try this command; if there'sç
no questionnaire on this system, Fido tells you so.

\subheading{V--Version number} This tells you what version ofç
Fido this system is using. Many versions of Fido exist (over aç
dozen at the time this manual was written); the number of theç
version you're calling can be useful if you're a veteran callerç
or system operator. For example, use it to see if this Fido isç
version 12--the version this guide describes.

\subheading{O--Outside} Ordinarily available only to callers withç
high access levels, the O)utside command quits Fido and deliversç
an errorlevel to DOS. Generally, this command exits to a batchç
file that lets a caller use programs that live somewhere on theç
system operator's disk.

\subheading{E--Exit to DOS} Ordinarily available only to callersç
with the same access level as the system operator, the E)xit-DOSç
command quits Fido and delivers an errorlevel to DOS. More oftenç
than not, it exits to a batch file that lets the system operatorç
run the system remotely.

\subheading{G--Goodbye} Use this to log off the system.ç
(Actually, you can just shut off your modem if you want to.)ç
Often this will give you a chance to leave a private message toç
the system operator.

\subheading{?--Help} Gets you on-line help, telling what eachç
command does. It's like the list you've been reading, exceptç
briefer (usually).  Anytime you can't figure out a command inç
Fido, just type a questionmark and press Enter.  Later versionsç
of Fido (version 12 and higher) also have something calledç
contextual help. See {\it ``Help Levels''} below for moreç
details.

\bigpagebreak
\heading Changing Caller Settings \endheading

To change a setting:

\example
\demo{1} Type C from the Main Section and press Enter.\enddemo

\demo{2} Type the proper letter for the setting you want toç
change; then press Enter.\enddemo

\demo{3} Type in the new info. If you press Enter without typingç
anything, the old information remains intact.\enddemo

\demo{4} Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all necessary items. \enddemo

\demo{5} Press Enter without typing anything else when you'veç
finished making changes.\enddemo
\endexample

Here's what you can change:

\demo{N--Caller name} Leave a space between your first and lastç
name -- that's how Fido tells the difference when you signç
on.\enddemo

\demo{A--City and state} This is the place you usually call from.ç
If you're paranoid, lie. (Computers are stupid and will believeç
anything.)\enddemo

\demo{P--Password} Change this every once in a while so that theç
bad guys can't use your time, or post libelous messages underç
your name. The system is pretty secure, but realize that theç
system operator can easily find out your password. Try not toç
worry about it. (Heh-heh.)\enddemo

\demo{H--Help level} Fido has three help levels; everybody startsç
off automatically set to Novice level. For the details, see {\itç
``Help Levels.''}\enddemo

\demo{W--Width of your screen} in characters (the Number ofç
Columns item).\enddemo

\demo{L--Length of your screen} in lines (the Number of Linesç
item).\enddemo

\demo{M--Turns the [More?] prompt on and off} When this is set toç
ON, Fido pauses when your screen is full (as determined by theç
settings under Width and Length, next in this list) and puts theç
message * [More?] * at the bottom of the screen: if you typeç
``N'' and press Enter, Fido aborts the rest of the message orç
bulletin and returns you to Command level; if you type any otherç
key and press Enter (or just press Enter without typingç
anything), Fido gives you another screenfull of text. When Moreç
is set to OFF, the text of a message or bulletin just keepsç
coming, scrolling information off the top of the screen asç
necessary. When the word More appears without a questionmark (asç
in * [More] *), you can't abort the rest of the message.\enddemo

\proclaim{Killing a listing} Usually you can abort any bulletinç
or message as it's being displayed by pressing Control-C orç
Control-K. If using Control-C or Control-K doesn't work, theç
system operator has disabled this option for the particularç
message or bulletin you're currently reading. The abort keysç
might work for other messages; continue to questionç
authority.\endproclaim

\demo{T--Tab Expansion} If this is set to ON, Fido sends theç
appropriate number of spaces for each CONTROL-I it encounters. Ifç
this is set to OFF, Fido will send a Control-I to your modem eachç
time it comes across a Tab character in a message or bulletin.ç
Tab defaults to ON. If your screen looks OK, ignore this setting;ç
if tables don't line up properly or if you get spuriousç
characters at the far right edge of the screen, change thisç
setting to whatever it's not.\enddemo

\demo{F--Filler-Nulls} Some printing terminals need to be sentç
null characters for timing purposes. Most terminals don't needç
any; see the manual that came with your terminal if youç
experience loss of characters at the beginning of lines.\enddemo

\bigpagebreak
\heading Help Levels \endheading

Fido has three help levels--{\bf Novice, Regular, or Expert}.  Toç
set the help level, choose the C command from the Main Menu; thenç
type a number for the level of help you want:

\demo{1} You're an expert. You have everything memorized. Youç
just want the system to tell you that it's time to give it aç
command:\enddemo

**
Main Command (?=help):
**

\demo{2} You're an experienced caller with a crummy memory. Youç
don't want a lot of help--just a list of all the letters you canç
type at this command prompt:\enddemo

**
MAIN Section:
Commands: M F B S C P L A V G (?=help):
**

\demo{3} You're a novice. You want full help--a one or two-wordç
explanation of each command, plus the list of all the letters youç
can type at this command prompt:\enddemo

**
MAIN Section:
M)sg-Section F)ile-Section B)ulletins 
S)tatistics C)hange P)age-Operator 
L)ist-Callers A)ns-Questionnaire V)ersion 
G)oodbye 
Command (?=help):
**

You can enter a questionmark for more detailed help on aç
section's commands, no matter what the help level is set at. Youç
can get even more detailed help for a particular command: Typeç
the command's letter immediately followed by a questionmark (forç
example, L?). If you get a message telling you that the help fileç
is missing, leave a message for the system operator saying so;ç
it's probably an oversight.

\bigpagebreak
\heading Message Section \endheading

The {\bf Message Section} holds all the messages that callersç
leave, either directly by typing them into this Fido orç
indirectly by typing them into the FidoMail section of some otherç
Fido, and sending them to this Fido via FidoNet. Fido can have upç
to 200 message areas, with an unlimited number of messages inç
each area. All the commands and prompts in all message areas areç
exactly the same, except for some special prompts in the FidoNetç
FidoMail message area. (See {\it ``Sending and Receivingç
FidoMail''}, later in this chapter, for the details.)

You get to the Message section by entering the M command in theç
Main Section. Assuming the Help level is set to 3 (Novice),ç
something close to this appears:

**
Message Area 2: Shred of Dignity Skaters' Union
Total messages:    40
Highest message:   53
Highest read:      22

N)ext P)revious E)nter K)ill T)o-You 
A)rea-Change R)eply C)ontinuous L)ist 
S)earch U)pdate-Msg O)verride-Path 
G)oodbye M)ain-Menu 
Command or Message Number 1-53 (?=help) [22 N]:
**

You go to the message area you were in the last time you calledç
this Fido. If you've never given the M command before, youç
automatically go to the area that the system operator hasç
determined is the place where new message readers go. The titleç
you see (Shred of Dignity Skaters Union) is the name of thisç
message section.

Fido is preset to let you read mail as soon as you enter aç
message section. The N within square brackets at the end of theç
command prompt [22 N] stands for N)ext, telling you that Fido isç
ready to display the next message you haven't yet read; all youç
need do is press Enter.

Fido numbers messages as they're entered. In this example,ç
Message area \#2 has 40 messages in it, with the highest messageç
numbered 53. Some messages have been deleted for one reason orç
another (at least 13--the difference between 53 and 40), eitherç
by the people who entered them, the people they were left for, orç
by the system operator.

Fido keeps track of the messages you've already read so that youç
don't waste your time rereading old messages. In the example, theç
caller has read up to message number 22. If the messages haveç
been renumbered by the system operator to get rid of holesç
previously occupied by now-deleted messages, the numbers changeç
accordingly. If you haven't been on before, Fido gives you theç
lowest number it can for the last message you read-- the numberç
1.

Here's what each command does, in brief. The ones that requireç
further explanation have their own detailed sections later on.

\demo{N--Next message}  This sets the direction of the next andç
subsequent message numbers that Fido displays for you. ``Next''ç
is defined as the number that appears after the bracket ([) justç
before the end of the prompt, +1. In the example above, theç
number is 22; so N gets you message #23. If message #23 doesn'tç
exist (because it was deleted) or if #23 is a private message,ç
Fido looks for the next existing non-private message. If no moreç
unread, non-deleted, non-private messages are left, Fido saysç
Highest message (which means that you've read all the messagesç
possible to read in this area) and prompts you for anotherç
command. To start at the very beginning of the message list inç
this area and read forward towards the end, type < and pressç
Enter.\enddemo


\demo{P--Previous message} This changes the direction of the nextç
and subsequent message numbers that Fido displays for you.ç
``Previous'' is defined as the number that appears after theç
bracket ([) just before the end of the prompt, minus 1. In theç
example above, the number is 22; so P gets you message #21. Ifç
message #21 doesn't exist (because it was deleted) or if #21 is aç
private message, Fido looks for the next existing non-privateç
message with a lower message number. If no more unread, non≠
deleted, non-private messages are left, Fido says Lowest messageç
(which means that you've read all the messages possible to readç
in this area) and prompts you for another command. To change theç
direction, enter the N command. To start at the very end of theç
message list in this area and read back towards the start, type >ç
and press Enter. \enddemo


\demo{E--Enter a new message} Fido prompts you for appropriateç
information. Here's an example:\enddemo

**
This will be message #54
From: Studley Whackburn
To: John Scribblemonger
Subject: Rights of Man
Private? [y,N]: n
Maximum message length, lines: 37
Enter your message, blank line to end
Words will wrap automatically

 1: 
**

(1: is the number of the line you're about to type; you'll findç
this line-numbering useful if you need to edit the message afterç
you've written it.) When you enter a message, Fido automaticallyç
puts in the message number--always one higher than the highestç
message number in the current area--and fills in the From: fieldç
with your name. 

You fill in the To: and Subject: fields.  (If you press Enterç
without typing something into either of these fields, Fidoç
assumes you want to cancel the message.) The To: field holds upç
to 35 characters, and the Subject: field can hold 71 characters.ç
If you want to make your message unreadable by all callers otherç
than you, the addressee, and the system operator, answer Y to theç
Private? prompt.

\proclaim{About privacy} System operators can read privateç
messages. Keep this in mind when you leave messages for people.ç
If the information you want to leave is so private and soç
personal that you wouldn't want anybody to read it, don't leaveç
it on any bulletin board. This applies doubly to FidoMail,ç
because sometimes FidoMail goes through several boards before itç
arrives at its destination--and each system operator along theç
way can read the mail. System operators as a group probably haveç
as much integrity as any general cross-section of the population.ç
But integrity aside, even some postal employees find itç
irresistible to read the occasional postcard.\endproclaim

The system operator decides how many lines long a message can be.ç
(Not just yours--the maximum message length applies equally toç
all messages.) You type in your message until you've finished.ç
You can ignore the ends of lines--Fido takes care of carriageç
returns and line feeds for you (although you can force carriageç
returns, like at the ends of paragraphs, by pressing Enter). Youç
press Enter twice to let Fido know you've finished. Fido thenç
brings up a set of special editing commands:

**
 1: Forget it, John; it's not worth it. There's no way that
 2: your mother will let you keep a python in the bathtub.
 3:

S)ave C)ontinue-adding A)bort L)ist E)dit-Line
D)el-Line I)ns-Line H)eader (?=help): 
**

The commands do what you think they do (Del is short for Deleteç
and Ins is short for Insert).  E)dit-Line, D)el-Line, and I)ns≠
Line all refer to the body of the message; use H)eader to editç
the information in the To:, Subject:, and Private? fields. (Toç
keep the old information, just press Enter at the appropriateç
prompt). If you need help with a command, type its first letterç
and a questionmark, and then press Enter.

\proclaim{Spelling counts in Fido} A private message left forç
Vladmir Jons will never be read by Vladmir Jones, or by anybodyç
else for that matter (except the system operator). Make sure theç
spelling in the To: field is correct before you save theç
message.\endproclaim

Later, when your message has been read by the person you've sentç
it to, Fido adds the tag (RECV'D) to the message's header line.ç
The number in square brackets before the tag tells you how manyç
times this particular message has been read by anyone comingç
across it (in this case, 5). The date is when the message wasç
entered:

\demo{K--Kills the message you just read}, assuming you wrote itç
or it was addressed specifically to you. You can't kill a messageç
that isn't yours--only the system operator can do that. \enddemo

\demo{T--Looks for the next message addressed to you}--that is,ç
messages that have your name in the To: field.  What ``nextç
message'' is depends on the number and letter that appear betweenç
brackets ([]) just before the end of the prompt; it will be aç
message with a higher number than the one in brackets if theç
letter  is N, lower if the letter is P (See N and P, earlier inç
this section.). To go from the very start of the message listç
through to the end, enter < T; to go from the end of the messageç
list and work back to the start, enter > T. (Note the spaceç
before the T in both cases.) \enddemo

Fido displays these messages for you one at a time, giving youç
the chance to reply to a message and then delete it as soon asç
you've read it. (Some Fidos run on floppy disk, where space is atç
a premium; so it's always a good idea to throw away a message youç
no longer need.) Here's what a message retrieved using the Tç
command looks like. In this example, Help level is at 2:

We don't accept complaints. Sorry.
**

It's a good idea to reply to a message before you delete it. Whenç
you reply to a message you've just read, Fido fills out the TOç
field for you.

\proclaim{The bonus RK command} After you've read a messageç
(addressed to you) that you want to reply to, use the command RK.ç
The RK command lets you reply to a message, and thenç
automatically deletes the original. That way you don't clutter upç
the disk with old messages.\endproclaim

\demo{A--Area change} This command shows you all the messageç
areas:\enddemo

**
----- Message Areas -----
  1) Ch@os
  2) Shred of Dignity Skaters Union
\star 4) FidoNet Messages
  5) 'Zine reviews & ads
Message Area [2]: 
**

The area marked with a \star is always the FidoNet FidoMailç
section. The number between square brackets at the end of theç
prompt is the area you were just in, and the area to which you'llç
automatically return if you press Enter without typing anotherç
number.

\proclaim{About missing numbers} The numbers of the areas thatç
appear in the areas list might not be sequential. (For instance,ç
3 is missing in the example.) Those areas do exist; you justç
don't have access to them. Each individual system operatorç
determines who can see what areas and who can use which commands.ç
If you need access to some area that you know exists but thatç
doesn't appear on your screen, leave a note for the systemç
operator asking for access.\endproclaim

\demo{R--Reply to the message you've just read} You can reply toç
any message, whether it's addressed to you or not. When you replyç
to a message, Fido automatically fills out the From:, To:, andç
Subject:  fields for you. (The To: field becomes REPLY To:) Youç
need to fill out the Private? field yourself. For details on howç
to enter a message, see the E command, earlier in this section.ç
\enddemo

\proclaim{Use R rather than E} Fido keeps track of all replies toç
a message such that a running conversation can occur. Forç
example, Fred enters a message that Gerry replies to. Alice readsç
Gerry's reply and replies to it, adding her own comments. Philç
sees Alice's reply and adds comments of his own by replying toç
her message, and so it goes. Later, anyone can trace theç
conversation using the special + command (described later), andç
read only the series of messages (called the thread in BBSç
terminology) concerned with this topic. To take part in theç
threaded conversation, always use the R command. You can use E toç
write a new message to anybody in the thread, of course; butç
people who use + won't see your comments.\endproclaim

\demo{C--Continuously show messages} All the messages from theç
one you last read through the end of the message list scrollsç
onto your screen without stopping. This happens even if you haveç
``More?'' turned on in the C)hange part of the Main section. Toç
go from the very start of the message list through to the end,ç
enter < C; to go from the end of the message list and work backç
to the start, enter > C. (Note the space before the C in bothç
cases.) To stop the list temporarily, press CONTROL-S. (Press itç
again to continue.) To abort the command, press CONTROL-C orç
CONTROL-K. \enddemo

\demo{L--List the headers (To:, From:, Subject: fields)} of allç
readable messages in the area, starting at the current one andç
going through either to the start or to the end of the messageç
list, depending on the current direction--N or P.  (You can'tç
search the body of a message.) A ``readable message'' is one thatç
isn't public, or if private is one that's addressed to or fromç
you. To go from the very start of the message list through to theç
end, enter < L; to go from the end of the message list and workç
back to the start, enter > L. (Note the space before the L inç
both cases.) This command is useful when you want to know who'sç
leaving messages, who's getting messages, or what the subjects ofç
people's messages are. (Of course, this assumes that people --ç
which includes you--leave really descriptive subject lines.)ç
\enddemo

\demo{S--Search the header} This command looks in the headers ofç
the current area's messages for a specified word, name, orç
phrase. The search starts at the current message and goes throughç
either to the start or to the end of the message list, dependingç
on the current direction (N or P). When it finds a match, Fidoç
displays the header and the rest of the message. To search forç
the next match, type S and press [CR] twice; Fido remembers theç
last search string entered. To go from the very start of theç
message list through to the end, enter < S; to go from the end ofç
the message list and work back to the start, enter > S. (Note theç
space before the S in both cases.) To stop the list temporarily,ç
press CONTROL-S. (Press it again to continue.) To abort theç
command, press CONTROL-C or CONTROL-K.\enddemo

\demo{U--Update the message you just read} The message must beç
one that you entered. Use this command to edit a message you'veç
written to someone and already saved. You edit an already-savedç
message in exactly the same way that you edit a message you're inç
the process of creating for the first time: Fido displays theç
message and brings up the editing commands:\enddemo

\bigpagebreak
\heading Special Navigation Commands \endheading

Fido has a few special character commands to help you get aroundç
in an area's message section better. A few of them have alreadyç
been mentioned, but you'll see them again here:

\example
.      Display (or redisplay) the current message. The currentç
message is the one whose number shows within square bracketsç
(along with the direction indicator N or P) just before the endç
of the prompt line. 

<     Reset the current message number to the lowest in this areaç
and set the direction to N (Next). When you press Enter, theç
lowest numbered readable message in the area will appear on theç
screen.

>     Reset the current message number to the highest in thisç
area and set the direction to P (Previous). When you press Enter,ç
the highest numbered readable message in the area will appear onç
the screen.

+    Read the reply to the last displayed message, if a replyç
exists. This lets you follow a discussion thread composed ofç
related messages (a reply to a reply to a reply\dots) withoutç
having intervening messages on other subjects interfere.

-    Read the message that this one is replying to (if thisç
message is a reply). Keep entering the minus sign to get back toç
the original message that started the discussion. (Fido will letç
you know when you've reached the original message.) That way youç
can follow the discussion thread through to the end by using +.

\bigpagebreak
\heading Sending and Receiving FidoNet Mail \endheading

At this writing (January, 1988), Fidos that exchange electronicç
mail (FidoNet) are operating in 17 countries and in all 50 of theç
United States\footnote{Sigh\dots here we go again.}. Fidos thatç
exchange FidoNet mail can connect directly with each other, orç
they can connect indirectly via ``host'' Fidos. The publicç
FidoNet network that uses Fido's system of exchanging mailç
currently has over 100 hosts and around 2500 nodes. (A hostç
accepts mail for all Fido nodes in its immediate geographicç
vicinity in order to keep telephone costs down.) FidoMail usuallyç
gets exchanged in the dark of night, when telephone costs areç
cheapest.

\demo{How you might use FidoNet} Assume that you live in San Francisco, and you have a friend or business associate who livesç
in Boston. S/he has a modem and a computer, and you have a modemç
and a computer. While costs are determined by each individualç
system operator, you can write a message of a few hundred wordsç
and send it overnight from the Fido that you use in San Franciscoç
to the one that s/he uses in Boston for about 25 cents. \enddemo

Not all Fidos use FidoNet, the part of Fido that makes exchangingç
electronic mail possible. To see if the Fido that you regularlyç
call uses FidoNet, use the A)rea command in the Message section:ç
Look for a message area name that has an asterisk (\star) next toç
it. If no name has an asterisk, then either that Fido isn't usingç
FidoNet or you need to have already set up a FidoNet accountç
before you can even get into the FidoNet area. (See the nextç
section of this manual.)  Leave a message for the system operator 
asking if s/he runs FidoNet and, if so, how you can set up anç
account. If s/he doesn't run FidoNet, leave a nasty message and call another Fido.

\bigpagebreak
\heading Setting Up a FidoNet Account \endheading

Sending an individual FidoNet message is very cheap. (In fact,ç
sending a message to a Fido within your local dialing area isç
probably free.) But a FidoNet system operator might find thatç
s/he has dozens of long-distance FidoMail messages going outç
every night. The phone bill for the system operator can add upç
fast. So most system operators insist that you have an accountç
set up with them before you start sending FidoMail. You'llç
usually find a bulletin telling you how to set up a FidoNetç
account. If you can't find the information you need, leave aç
message for the system operator asking for details.

The Credit line that you see when you enter the Change command inç
the Main section shows how much you have to spend on FidoMail.ç
The system operator credits your account when you send whateverç
s/he requires (or when you fulfill your part of whateverç
arrangement you have). 

\proclaim{About charges} Your account gets charged for eachç
FidoMail message you make, and the account is reconciled afterç
mail gets sent. You always know how much it costs to send aç
message before you send it; a list of prices is always available.ç
(You'll find details on how to find prices in the nextç
section.)\endproclaim

\bigpagebreak
\heading Using the FidoNet Message System \endheading

(This section assumes you're in the FidoNet message area as youç
read along.) You use the same process to leave a message in theç
FidoNet area as you do in any other Message area, except that youç
also have to add a FidoNet address. Here's what you see after youç
tell FidoNet you want to enter a message:

**
This will be message #46
From: Studley Whackburn  on Fido 1:125/101
To: 
**

The number at the end of the From: field is the address of theç
Fido you're calling from. A full address has three sections toç
it, and it's written in the form zone:net/Fido. (The colon andç
the slash are important.) When you send FidoMail to somebody, youç
need to include a FidoNet numeric address. To continue theç
example:

**
This will be message #46
From: Studley Whackburn  on Fido 1:125/101
To: Tim Pozar
Current Net is NET      125 SF Bay Net, San Francisco CA, $0.26
Z)one N)et F)ido (or numeric FidoNet address) (?=Help): 1:101/318
**

This piece of FidoMail is going to the Fido board whose completeç
address is Zone 1, Net 101, Fido 318.

The first number in the address is the zone number; it representsç
some vast geographic area, usually a country. Zone is a featureç
that's just starting to be used; you can usually ignore it.

The second number (101) represents the net, the affiliation ofç
Fidos in a particular geographic area--in the example, the stateç
of Massachusetts (and one or two stragglers from Rhode Island).ç
Note that this number is always followed by a slash.

The third number (318) is the Fido number--the number of aç
specific Fido board. Only one Fido in a net has this number. ç
Somebody in another net might have that same node number, just asç
somebody in a different telephone area code might have sameç
seven-digit telephone number.

So you can write this complete FidoNet address as eitherç
1:101/318 or simply 101/318.

\bigpagebreak
\heading Finding an address \endheading

The problem is how to find the address of the Fido that somebodyç
uses. Unfortunately, there's no international FidoNet caller'sç
directory. Ideally, you know the complete numeric address of theç
Fido that your friend uses. Short of that, FidoNet can help youç
find the Fido's address if you know the Fido's net number, itsç
name, or its city. Assume for this exercise that your friend hasç
an account on the PC WEEK board in Boston, Massachusetts.

\bigpagebreak
\heading The N Command \endheading

The N command shows you a list of all the nets:

**
NET        1 Int'l Tech Coord, So Roxana IL, $0.22
NET       10 Calif Nevada, Lompoc CA, $0.26
NET      102 SoCalNet, Los Angeles CA, $0.26
\dots
\dots

NET       16 New England, CT ME MA NH RI VT, $0.20
NET      101 MassNet, Gardner MA, $0.20
\dots
\dots
NET      713 QLD NET, BRISBANE QLD AUSTRALIA, $2.38
NET       59 OCEANIA INDEPENDENT, SOUTH PACIFIC, $2.38
**

(The \dots indicate items present in the listing, but left out ofç
this example.) The number on a particular line is the number ofç
the net described. The next item on the line is the name of theç
host of that net (or a creative contraction of the host's name).ç
The third item is the location of that host. The final number isç
the amount of money it costs to send a message to that host fromç
the Fido that you're using at the moment. (In most cases, that'sç
also how much it costs to send a message to every Fido served byç
that host.)

This list shows just a few of the nets; there are over 100 ofç
them. The idea is to browse through the net list until you findç
one that's likely to encompass the board you're looking for. Whenç
you find a likely candidate, you can stop the list by enteringç
CONTROL-C or CONTROL-K. 

Assume that the best candidate for a net likely to hold Boston'sç
PC WEEK board is net 101, the MassNet board located in Gardner,ç
Massachusetts. When Fido prompts you, you type 

101/ [CR]

This rather arcane message tells Fido you want to send a messageç
to some board affiliated with net 101.  Here's what the promptç
looks like after you've searched the Net list and entered the netç
designation:

**
Current Net is NET      125 SF Bay Net, San Francisco CA, $0.26
Z)one N)et F)ido (or numeric FidoNet address) (?=Help): 101/
Current Net is NET      101 MassNet, Gardner MA, $0.20
Z)one N)et F)ido (or numeric FidoNet address) (?=Help): 
**

The current net number has changed; it's now 101. The current netç
number determines what you'll see when you enter the F command.

\subheading{The F Command}

The F command lists all the Fidos in the current net:

**
Current Net is NET      101 MassNet, Gardner MA, $0.20
N)et F)ido (or numeric FidoNet address) (?=Help): F
NET        101 MassNet, Gardner MA, $0.20
            14 WayStar, Marlboro MA, $0.20
            27 Daves Fido, Gardner MA, $0.20
\dots
\dots
           318 PC Week, Boston MA, $0.20
           366 Westboro Fido, Westboro MA, $0.20
\dots
\dots
**

Again, there are too many boards in MassNet to list them all, butç
you don't have to--PC WEEK is Board number 318 in net 101, orç
101/318.

Yes, it is indeed crude, but it's effective. A better way ofç
locating a board's address is coming someday. Just hang in thereç
for now.
 
Try entering some fake FidoMail now to somebody in your own net,ç
just for the experience. (Remember to delete fake mail whenç
you're through.)

\bigpagebreak
\heading Sending a File \endheading

If you have a high enough access level, Fido will ask if you wantç
to attach a file to your message. You can send any file alongç
with your message, as long as the file exists somewhere on theç
system operator's disk. Fido prompts you for a full pathname:

**
Attach File(s)? [y,N]: y
Full PathName(s): 
**

As you can see, you have to have very high access to be able toç
attach files: Most people don't know what pathnames to use to getç
around a system operator's disk. (The descriptive names in theç
File Area list won't do as full pathnames.)

Why everybody can't attach files: Most system operators don't letç
the majority of callers attach files to their messages because ofç
the expense and because of the access to the disk drive(s) thisç
command gives people. As to the expense: It's one thing to send aç
message of a couple hundred words across the country at 1200ç
baud; that costs only a few cents. But sending a 50,000-byte fileç
across the country gets really expensive. The price you see inç
the nodelist only covers a message; it can't take into accountç
the prices for sending files. (At present, FidoNet's accountingç
system isn't very sophisticated.) Additionally, the Attach Filesç
feature gives a caller full access to the entire disk system.ç
This means, theoretically, that a caller could use MS-DOSç
wildcard commands to attach the file \star.\star to a message--and send everything on the system operator's disk to, say,ç
Bangkok.

\bigpagebreak
\heading Files Section \endheading

The Files section holds files you can copy for your own use.ç
Callers (including you) donate files to the board using theç
Upload command; the system operator then checks the files to makeç
sure that they're either in the public domain or that the file'sç
copyright owner has given permission that they be distributedç
without charge. (See the section below called {\it ``Honor Systemç
Distribution.''})  Fido can have up to 200 file areas in theç
Files section, with an unlimited number of files in each area.ç
All the commands and prompts in all file areas are exactly theç
same.

Here's what you get when you choose F)iles from the Main section: 

**
File Area 1: General Rock & Roll
F)iles D)ownload U)pload A)rea-Change T)ype 
S)tatistics L)ocate R)aw-Display 
K)ill-File O)verride-Path G)oodbye 
M)ain-Menu 
Command (?=help):
**

(Actually, you're likely not to see several of these commands:ç
R)aw-Display, K)ill-File and O)verride-Path are ordinarilyç
reserved for callers with the same access level as the systemç
operator. They're shown here for completeness.)

The first line tells you the number of the current file area, andç
gives a brief description of the kinds of files this area holds.ç
The other lines list the commands. 

Here's a description of what each command means. Commandsç
preceded by a \circle are ordinarily available only to callersç
with very high access levels :

\demo{F--Files list} Shows you the names of the files in thisç
section, the size of each file in bytes, and a brief descriptionç
of what the file does:\enddemo

**
CUTEFONE.EXE     7680 Turns your phone # into possible words
AREACODE.EXE    19328 Tells area codes for cities, and vice versa
QUOTES.BBS      17557 the quotes you get when you log on 
CH@OS.AD         1463 Text bomb to drop on other BBSs
\dots
**

You can use the MS-DOS wildcard characters \star and ? to listç
specific files:

**
Command (?=help): *.EXE

CUTEFONE.EXE     7680 Turns your phone # into possible words
AREACODE.EXE    19328 Tells area codes for cities, and vice versa
**

See your MS-DOS manual for details on wildcard characters.

\demo{D--Download one or more files} Use this command to transferç
a copy of any file in the Files section to your computer. Theç
system you're using must have some kind of a storage device toç
hold the file you're getting (which lets you out if you're usingç
just a terminal with no disk drives), and the telecommunicationsç
program you're using to call Fido must have a file transferç
protocol that Fido can understand. Here's what you see:\enddemo

**
Command (?=help): D
A)scii, K)ermit, X)modem, XC)modem-CRC, T)elink
Transfer Type: A K X XC T (?=help): 
**

Fido tells you the size of the file in blocks (1 block = 128ç
bytes except for Kermit where it equals something strange), andç
how long it will take to download the file using the protocolç
you've selected. If you don't know what you're doing, use Xmodem. 

\proclaim{Honor System Distribution} There's a difference betweenç
public domain software, ``Freeware'' (software, documentation,ç
and/or data that the producer is allowing people to use--usuallyç
with certain restrictions--without charge), and ``Shareware''.ç
``Shareware''  is software, documentation, and/or data (oftenç
copyrighted) distributed on the honor system: You get it free,ç
but you're honor-bound to send payment or a donation to theç
producer if you continue to use it after a trial period. Moreç
often than not, the income from Shareware is the only income theç
producer gets. So if you don't send the money, you're literallyç
stealing somebody's paycheck.\endproclaim

You can use the MS-DOS wildcard characters \star and ? toç
download several files in a row if you use the Telink or Kermitç
protocols. See your MS-DOS manual for the details on wildcardç
characters; see the manual that came with your telecommunicationsç
software for information on Telink and/or Kermit.

\demo{U--Upload a file} Use this command to send files forç
general posting in an appropriate Fido file area. This worksç
essentially like Download, except in reverse. (Fido can't tellç
how long it will take to upload the file or how many blocks itç
has, of course, as it does when you download a file.) The systemç
operator will ordinarily check the file you've sent to make sureç
that it's either in the public domain or that the file'sç
copyright owner has given permission that the file be distributedç
without charge. \enddemo

You can use the MS-DOS wildcard characters \star and ? to uploadç
several files in a row if you use the Telink or Kermit protocols.ç
See your MS-DOS manual for the details on wildcard characters;ç
see the manual that came with your telecommunications softwareç
for information on Telink and/or Kermit.
 
Got enough room? Use the Statistics command in the Files sectionç
to  check the available free space on the Fido you're usingç
before you use the Upload command. Fido has no way to warn you inç
advance that your upload might get chopped off in the middle --ç
which happens when Fido runs out of upload disk space.

\demo{A--Area change.} This commands shows you all the file areasç
and lets you change to another one:\enddemo

**
----- File Areas -----
  1) General Rock & Roll
\star 2) FidoNet Files
  4) IBM-PC Software
  5) Macintosh Software
File Area [3]: 
**

(The area marked with a \star is always the FidoNet Filesç
section.) The number between square brackets just before theç
prompt is the area you were just in, and the area to which you'llç
automatically return if you press Enter without typing anotherç
number. Type the number of the file area you want to move to andç
press Enter.

\proclaim{About missing numbers} The numbers of the areas thatç
appear in the areas list might not be sequential. Those areas doç
exist; you just don't have access to them. Each individual systemç
operator determines who can see what areas and who can use whichç
commands. If you need access to some area that you know existsç
but that doesn't appear on your screen, leave a note for theç
system operator asking for access.\endproclaim

\demo{T--Type a text file on screen} This command scrolls theç
contents of a text file onto your screen. (Files with the suffixç
.DOC, .ASC, and .TXT are almost always text files.) It'sç
essentially the same as downloading a file using the ASCIIç
protocol.\enddemo

\demo{S--Statistics.} This shows the same information as does theç
statistics command in the Main section, except that filesç
information replaces the FidoNet credit information.ç
Specifically, you'll see information on the number of bytesç
you've uploaded or downloaded, and the space available forç
uploading files in this area:\enddemo

\demo{L--Locate a file in any file area} that you have access to.ç
Use this command to find out if Fido has a file you're lookingç
for, and if so what area it's in:\enddemo

Command (?=help): L
File(s) to search for: TWIX.DOC
  1) General Rock & Roll
\star 2) FidoNet Files
  3) Tools

You can use the MS-DOS wildcard characters \star and ? to locateç
specific files. See your MS-DOS manual for wildcard characterç
details.


\circle \demo{R--list all files and subdirectory names in theç
current directory} (The Files command in reality just presentsç
some of the contents of a file called FILES.BBS, an ordinarilyç
hidden file that holds a list of essential data about allç
available files, but that doesn't necessarily show the completeç
contents of any subdirectory.) Most often, this command is usedç
by the system operator to perform Fido housekeeping tasks fromç
some location other than the terminal connected to the computerç
that's actually running Fido.\enddemo

\circle \demo{K--delete a file and removes its entry fromç
FILES.BBS} (The contents of FILES.BBS is what gets displayed whenç
you give the File command.) Most often, this command is used byç
the system operator to perform Fido housekeeping tasks from someç
location other than the terminal connected to the computer that'sç
actually running Fido.\enddemo

\demo{O--Override the normal pathname} Ordinarily available onlyç
to callers with a privilege level equal to that of the systemç
operator, the O)verride-Path command lets you specify a differentç
pathname for the display of files summoned by any command in theç
File section (except the A)rea-Change command). The originalç
pathname is reset as soon as you leave the current area (forç
example, by using M)ain-Menu, A)rea-Change, or G)oodbye). Mostç
often, this command is used by the system operator to performç
Fido housekeeping tasks from some location other than theç
terminal connected to the computer that's actually runningç
Fido.\enddemo

\demo{G--Goodbye} Use this to log off the system. (Actually, youç
can just shut off your modem if you want to.) Often this willç
give you a chance to leave a private message to the systemç
operator.\enddemo

\demo{M--Main menu} Returns you to the Main section.\enddemo

\heading Fido's Command Buffer--An Undocumented Featureç
\endheading

Experienced callers can save a lot of time by skirting many ofç
Fido's prompts. You do this by putting several commands on theç
same line, separated by spaces. For example, assume that youç
start from the Main Section,  and that you want to list the filesç
in area 7--an area different from the one you looked at the lastç
time you used the File section. Here's how you'd do it:

**
	F A 7 F [CR]
**

You'll go directly from the Main Menu to a list of the files inç
Area 7. This is possible because Fido's commands are all (orç
nearly all) one-character commands, a bunch of which Fido canç
remember in its command buffer.

Here's a further shortcut: Use a vertical bar to represent aç
carriage return. For example, at the signon prompt, Fido expectsç
to see up to three names (First, Middle, Last). Use the verticalç
bar to indicate you've finished with your name, then go on toç
confirm that the name is correct and add your password:

**
	John Scribblemonger | Y Scribe [CR]
**

You'll end up going directly from the signon prompt to the post-signon messages without going through the prompts in between.

The More? prompt clears Fido's command buffer. This means that ifç
a system message is so long that it puts the More? prompt at theç
bottom of the screen, Fido waits for you to press the Enter keyç
before going on--and then forgets whatever other commands you'veç
entered. For example:

**
John Scribblemonger | Y Scribe F A 7 D X Mortcalc.EXE | G N [CR]
**

This line would log John Scribblemonger onto the system (usingç
his password Scribe), go to area 7 of the Files section, use theç
Xmodem protocol to download a program called Mortcalc.EXE, andç
log off the system without leaving a message for the systemç
operator. But if the system operator has a long post-signonç
message that invokes [More?], all the commands after the passwordç
get trashed. The solution is to use the C)hange command to turnç
off the [More?] prompt--and pray for a clean phone line.


Just to be complete: Other things that flush this type-aheadç
buffer (as it's called in the trade) are CONTROL-C, CONTROL-K,ç
CONTROL-S (which pauses output), and CONTROL-F (whose onlyç
purpose is to flush the type-ahead buffer).

\bye
