1:125/111, June 89. An article I wrote for FidoNews, theç
electronic newsletter of the FidoNet communicationsç
network.} I see my name is getting dragged into this, I thoughtç
I'd respond on the subject of Zone 2's autonomy, which is reallyç
an issue of control.

First of all, no one need worry about trademark abuse; I am inç
contact with all parties involved, and there is nothing to worryç
about. Things will be settled to everyone's benefit andç
satisfaction. No further discussion is needed on this matter. 

It is none of our business\margintext{What's going on is,ç
provincial law'n'order control freaks in the U.S. were (and stillç
are) trying to make (in this case) European FidoNet membersç
behave `like us', the `correct' way. Same old story. It'sç
especially embarrassing in an international environment. The goodç
part is that it really {\rm is} an inter-national environment,ç
and people {\rm are} learning. It's not a pretty process to watchç
though, and real damage does get done along the way. Oh well.}ç
how Zone 2 (or any other zone) runs their network(s), other thanç
how they interface to us, just as it is no business to net 125ç
how net XYZ runs theirs, unless it somehow physically affects ourç
operation. If they have different criteria for joining a network,ç
what business is it of ours? To meddle ahead of time ``in caseç
they do something awful'', is silly; they are no more (or less)ç
likely to do something stupid than we in Zone 1 are. Europe isç
not just the U.S.-only-different; it is a totally differentç
environment, socially, technically, legally and politically.ç
Europe is none of our damn business. 

Zone 1 is not the police force of the world. Have we not learned ç
our lessons from other arenas? We do not ``have'' a unified 
world-wide network, nor is such a thing even desirable. What weç
do have is a number of cooperative networks, that can cooperateç
in a world-wide networking effort. This is a critical difference. 

Unfortunately, meddlers and control freaks will not give up untilç
everything not exactly like themselves is squashed orç
controlled\margintext{It's funny for me to read two years laterç
and see how fast and how far the law'n'order mentality has goneç
in this country. Ha ha.}. Or they are in turn removed. We have aç
growing bureaucracy in our Zone 1 that wants to reorganize usç
from being a bottom-up network, where sysops choose their netç
hosts and other /0's, and determine how to run their own BBS,ç
nets and lives, to one (according to POLICY4) where the existingç
bureaucracy picks their own region and net hosts. Bureaucratsç
always tell us, if they can control this one more thing, then allç
the problems will be solved.

Our network has never run smoothly, and I propose that it willç
{\it never} run smoothly; this is good, not bad. It means we'reç
alive, only dead rigid bureaucracies are pure order. (Or pretendç
they are.) Excessive order is not good for any organism. Itç
stifles creativity and free expression. Let's take a hint fromç
history, OK?
