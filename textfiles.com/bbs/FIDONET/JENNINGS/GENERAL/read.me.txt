Here's some stuff about the World War about to start. YOu will find
JOSH rather funny I think. It has notthing to do with anything else,
and it's short.

Read the first couple of things in Z2 to get a flavor of RDs style.
The messages in TO_TOM.ZIP (two files) are also illuminating. Lots of
the rest is dull and l o o o o o o n g.

When I start to smell shit, I save it in a big file, so that later I
can (possibly) find previous things. Glad I did with RD. Wish I had
saved more... Now I've got a tape backup, and a LAN, stuff gets saved
that didn't used to...

JOSH		for your amusement only. Some people are amazing!
Z2		RD's comment on an editorial, my reply, Apr 92. Followed by
		other junk (which is skippable)
WAR		rather bulky
TO_TOP.ZIP	Stuff from Henk (msgs to/from RD)
ZONEWAR		Henk's complaints Mar 92
