Tom:

Just a reminder that you should see your attorney about filing a section 8/15 
affidavit on the mark Fidonet.  They are generally filed in the 5th year but 
MUST be filed before August 18, 1993 else the registration is cancelled by 
operation of law (Fido was registered in 1988). 

Best regards

Bob
