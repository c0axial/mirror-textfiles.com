Gay-related Echomail Conferences available from PCBL_BBS (1:204/501.0)
and PCBL_TOO (1:204/502):

(P) indicates private messages are carried in the echo and participating
    systems must be able to handle them.

[SOME.POL] indicates the file-requestable policy document for a conference.
           PLEASE NOTE: You can request all current policies from PCBL by
           file requesting POLICIES.ARC. You may also file-request policies
           individually. PCBL has a ten-file limit on file requests per
           session. Since there are more than ten policy documents, if you
           try to file request them all individually in one call, you will
           receive the first ten, and all others from eleven on will be
           refused. In that case, request the archive of all policy documents
           to get around this. It is archived with ARC 5.21 in order to make
           it available for decompression on nearly every system, regardless
           of CPU type.

{BackBone} indicates a conference from the FidoNet backbone. FidoNet echo
           policies apply to backbone echo conferences.

MOD: name, net/node  indicates the echo's moderator and home system.
