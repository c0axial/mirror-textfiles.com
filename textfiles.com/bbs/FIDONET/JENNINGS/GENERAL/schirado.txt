Just saw your post in this weeks' CuD. Glad to see you're still
around and about.

In case I never mentioned this, Fido was the only software I
could find to run a BBS on my DEC Rainbow when I first entered
the world of telecommunications at the age of 12. Thanks for
getting me started.

(The other big moment I remember is reading "Famous Homosexuals
in Fidonet Revealed!" :)

Live long, and prosper!
(No, i'm not a trekkie... i just like the sentiment.)
