My board seems to have an afliction that can best be described as 
'Fidorot' or 'Fido dulldrums'.  It seemed like an excellent idea 
to bring up a Fido system of my own.  My company was willing to 
provide the resources and I had the time and interest to 
undertake SYSOP duties.  There were only a few Fido nodes in my 
area and it seemed as if it was getting harder to gain access to 
them.  I even came up with what I thought was a unique idea for a 
theme.  But after less than three months in operation, my board 
seems to have stagnated!
 
There haven't been any new ideas lately.  The frequency of calls 
is dwindling.  Nothing new has been uploaded. There hasn't been 
any Fido mail for days. I NEED HELP!

Please help this board to survive!  I'll listen to ideas, 
comments, suggestions or any kind of help.  Please take the time 
to Fido mail your favorite freeware program, new SYSOP utilities, 
an article that you read last week, games, or anything of 
interest or contraversy to keep this board alive.

This board needs a quick injection of activity.  If you like 
phoning Fidos in other places, how about trying PC Techniques!
