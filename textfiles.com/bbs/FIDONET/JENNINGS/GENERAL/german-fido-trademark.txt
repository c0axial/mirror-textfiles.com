Tom,
    Although your last response to a message from me, even though my message was polite and to the point, failed to arrive.  I hope you're not as singularly rude with this one, but I hold out no expectations.  You should be informed of this.

Hallo Werner!

Wie geht's Dir denn sonst so? Habe heute endlich Bescheid vom Patentamt
bekommen. Dauert ganz schoen lange, bis so eine Warenzeichenanmeldung durch
ist. Somit ist der Name FIDO endlich auch in Deutschland geschuetzt.  ;-))

MfG Hans-Juergen

These things are amazingly local.  People filing
in Germany wouldn't do a search which includes the
US, so it's not surprising that the Germans didn't
find your US registration.

Also, in most of the world, including Germany, the
first to file in a country gets the right in that
country even if there's a prior registration somewhere
else.  That leaves you with two choices: forget it
or negotiate a settlement giving you the German ownership
of the mark.

Let me know what you decide to do.

Dan
