Hi William,

I have noticed these past two weeks, that your system has been calling ç
here to send netmail and occasionally request a file or two.  The file ç
request makes me think you know that your system is calling here, but then ç
again, I wanted to warn you.

My logs indicate that you are making long distance calls during the ç
daytime hours, pretty much every day since July 25th, and occasionally ç
prior to that.  I just wanted to insure that you know about these calls.

If you are going to continue to route mail here, you might want to set up ç
a HOLD verb and use a CHANGE after rates go down.

Regards...

I have been _Regional_ Host-routing all outbound mail for the past  month ç
or so.  I.e. the 107/2 mail is going directly to 13/0 and the  381/5 to ç
19/0.  I suppose I can imagine problems with Net107, given  its turbulent ç
history and the fact you've been having problems with  stuff to that net ç
all along.  I can guarantee that my mail is reaching  the RCs -- see it ç
being delivered all the time, every day.  I even  got the following ç
forwarded msg a few days ago, from 19/0...
