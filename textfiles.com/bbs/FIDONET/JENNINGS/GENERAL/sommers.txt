... how much of a fool I mean dedicated I mean interested OK I'll get 
to the point...
 
In May or so, I will be moving to New Mexico, prolly ALbuquerque. I 
will want to dump I mean get rid of I mean TRANSFER the editorshiphood 
of FidoSnooze to someone disreputable I mean
 
Are you interested? (Tim Pozar is to blame for the suggestion).
 
It's really not very painful at all. Really. It's actually kinda a 
pleasure, with about once per month "some issue" to deal with, usually 
one of the cranks (names you'll recognize) with some trivial but 
annoying complaint, which I tersely and factually breeze over.
 
I think the "policy" nonsense is worked out well. It seems to have 
some sort of life again. Involvement consists of: about 1 meg disk 
space, some unpleasant batch files (well, one, and it's not that bad), 
and the editorial to write, which if you'll look at this week's, 
you'll see can be pretty minimal.
 
Whatever. If you want to kill me or something less dreadful even, 
lemme know. Lotsa time to think.
 
By the way -- pls don't tell people ANYTHING about this. I want to 
absolutely avoid machinations by some of the scummier crowd.
 
Oh yeah, distribution consists of one (1) copy to George Peace, 
1:13/13, sometime Sun/Mon.
