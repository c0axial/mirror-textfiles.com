 Old Fido history files. Please upload anything you have
 of this sort of thing. If I already have it, Fido will
 refuse to accept it.

 I'd really like to have things on the following subjects:
 argument why NETs were unnecessary; ditto ZONEs; net
 swapover discussions (ca. 1985); LU.C; 
 
 Also if you have paper copies of old articles, I'd love
 to have a copy. I'll pay copying costs if necessary. My
 mailing address is: Tom Jennings, Box 77731, San Fran-
 cisco CA 94107.

 Other related uploads appreciated...
