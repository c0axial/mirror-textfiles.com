The following is the result of a poll conducted by Eelco de
Graaff, host of 2:281, on behalf of the hosts of nets 280
thru' 285, requesting by netmail all sysops of those nets
to express their opinion on the reorganisation of Region 28
into non overlapping nets as was demanded by the ZC2, Ron
Dwight.
 
The region 28 segment for day 241 contains 582 nodes, 210 of
them located in the so called social nets 286, 500 and 512.
In order to avoid any appearance of manipulation, the sysops
of these nodes have intentionally not been invited to parti-
cipate in those polls.
 
The distribution of voters per net was as follows:
 
net 280 -  35 sysops out of a total of  86 (40.7%) have voted
net 281 -  38 sysops out of a total of  56 (67.9%) have voted
net 282 -  21 sysops out of a total of  43 (48.8%) have voted
net 283 -  28 sysops out of a total of  61 (45.9%) have voted
net 284 -  23 sysops out of a total of  37 (62.2%) have voted
net 285 -  52 sysops out of a total of  89 (58.4%) have voted
-------------------------------------------------------------
          197 sysops out of a total of 372 (53.0%) have voted
 
Thus the majority of the 'electorate' has voted.
 
Votes in favour of reorganisation:   23 sysops (11.7%)
Votes against reorganisation:       166 sysops (84.2%)
No preference was expressed by:       8 sysops ( 4.1%)
 
Considering that 210 other sysops have voted by obtaining a node
number in a social net, 376 sysops out of a total of 582 parti-
cipants in region 28 (64.6%) may be considered in favour of the
current situation, 23 (4%) were in favour of reorganisation and
of the remaining 183 sysops (31.4%) the opinion is not known.
