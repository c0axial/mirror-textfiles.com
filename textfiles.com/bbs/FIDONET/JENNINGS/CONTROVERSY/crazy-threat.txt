On voice mail, Thursday 18 nov 932pm. Played back Saturday AM, about 11.
Josh heard it.

Exact quote:

"It says on the back of a certain flyer, 'Fidonet and Fido are
registered trademarks of Tom Jennings'.  I hope this is not the
right one. But you are a murder. If ... it is.  You are a murderer.
Responsible for a program designed to harrass one individual."

End of quote. Disconnect.


Deep male voice, somewhat slow talking, careful, casual. Graveley?
Hint of East Coast, New York state, not strong.

I think the 'certain flyer' is the "SF Net" cafe/BBS terminal flyer. I
have one somewhere. It does say that.
