Hi Matt!

> I no longer agree, and do not support it.

Well, I'll remember what kind of turncoat friend you can be.  Next thing
we know, you'll revive IFNA and make Thom Henderdweeb chair of FSC.

Problem is that Ron could fuck up the most reasonable of plans or
policies.  He has the Midas touch, everything he touches turns to mufflers
(American joke, Midas Mufflers is a nationwide car repair ripoff place).

I have never been a supporter of overlapping nets.  But I am willing to
discuss it with Henk until he sees reason.  The way I see it, Henk and I
are only three or four years into our discussion of the problem.  I figure
that Henk sees reason slowly <grin>.

> If I must, I will approve the introduction of regional policies in Zone ç
2.

Bad precedent.  I would not want to deal with my RC with such a precedent
set.  Have Ron taken out and drowned in his own beer, it's simpler.

> The juvenile delinquent you have installed as RC28 must be removed.

Frank van der Loo drilled my ear for 3/4 of an hour on the phone
yesterday, despite my telling him that the more he talked the less I
thought of him.  What really threw him was when I told him that I thought
he was an absolute fool and acting like an ass, but I would give him an
echo feed as long as he polled me.  He still did not understand, even when
I told him that spending $3000/month might make him wiser much faster.

Maybe the Dutch are just slow learners.  :-)

> Attacking me won't achieve anything, so don't bother.

But it's such fun!

Call when you're in the States.  I may be in Bostonm end of next week.
Will be in Bay Area 24-25 Aug, but not much free time (except maybe Sun
night).  I now have a cellular to which my office phone forwards (503)
690-3648.

Would love to gossip, but not too much about Z2 games.  They're a bit
booooring.  But I guess that they have to be stopped.

Five days to get through.  Ugh.  And likely it was because I called you.  ç
We
have a real problem.

> I am pissed off at "Henks side" (sic) just slightly less than "Ron's 
> Side" (sic).

The best attribute of Henk's side is that they actually follow our ç
agreement
not to tell me about it all.  But in this one, Henk seems to have the ç
support
of Joop Mellart and Peter Janssens, his classic enemies; this is a serious
sign.

> Plus I've got a rant about technophillic offline-readeritis.

Be sure to mention that those fucking offline readers feel the need to add
major undectable/deletable brag lines, which look absolutely juvenile and
embarrassing when gated to internet.

Tom,

Wanted to talk to you, guess what subject?

 > Matt -- do you have an opinion on what Ron Dwight is doing? It sure 

I'm flying out for New York shortly. Will call you as soon as I can from ç
there. Yes, I want to stop Mr. D.

Regards,


Matt

WARNING to all: I am about to get on a plane to New York. Contact may be ç
intermittent for a few days.

Ron,

I agreed initially with your proposal to 'reorganise' Zone 2.

I no longer agree, and do not support it. Don't claim you were relying on ç
my support, either -- since those early messages I have several times ç
cautioned you about the upheaval you would create, and asked you to back ç
off.

I consider the situation in Region 28 unacceptable, and will take whatever ç
steps necessary and available to me to calm things down.

If I must, I will approve the introduction of regional policies in Zone 2.

The juvenile delinquent you have installed as RC28 must be removed.

I insist you revert to the 'pre-war' status in all Regions until this is ç
resolved. It can be resolved by:

1) Presenting your case to the Zone Coordinators Council and getting their ç
agreement to overrule me.

2) Modifying your approach.

Attacking me won't achieve anything, so don't bother.

Regards

Matt
