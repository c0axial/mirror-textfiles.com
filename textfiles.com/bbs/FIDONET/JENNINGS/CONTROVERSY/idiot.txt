Hello Tom!

Below please find a cut-and-paste from the current Fidonews:

My electronic world is deteriorating. I have to call in at 300 baud to
edit this rag (sic) due to problems with the phone line here at my
(new) boyfriends house here in the Pacific NorthWest.

I have to admit that I'm not doing a particularly good job this week;
I've fallen terribly in love with a wonderful punk boy, and won't be
back at the end of the month like I said. Don't worry, I wont inflict
lovey-dovey garbage on FidoNews readers. People in love are sooo
disgusting to be around (just ask his roommate).

==========================================================================

I am glad for you that you are happy with your new lover, however, I have ç
absolutely no desire to read about your private life in Fidonews.

I have seen you mention being gay at different times in the editorial.  I ç
don't personally care whether you are gay, straight, twisted, asexual, or ç
whatever <grin>.  I don't, however, read Fidonews to find out about your ç
latest sexual adventures.  I read it to find out about Fidonet, and I ç
don't see that being gay or any or sexual preference has anything ç
whatsoever to do with running a Fido system.

This is a personal request to leave your private life out of Fidonews.

                                  Thanks,
                                   Mike

Hi Tom,

 The SDN 1 Plus CDROM is now a reality.. Yeah! I have the #0001 framed on ç
my wall and your copy was sent Saturday.. Look for it whenever you get ç
back from vacation... Hope you enjoy it... I read of all your troubles ç
calling to read your mail at 300 baud (ick!), so I won't bother you with ç
annoucement about the disc in fnews until you return home and it will be ç
easier for ya...

Also, many congrats on your new love.. :) Hope it works out wonderfully ç
for you.

 Karen

Dear Sir;

While I have not been around FIDO all that long, I was under the mistaken ç
belief that it was an amateur communications network of, for & by the ç
people.

Recently the Perot echo completed all previously known requirements to be ç
placed on the backbone.  Now, additional previously unpublished rules have ç
been formulated which appear to be aimed specifically at delaying backbone ç
status to this one particular echo.

I am not a political person, but I am a firm believer in freedom of speech ç
and an informed populace.  That is the reason I carry so many echos - ç
backbone or not, pro or con anything.  I run a free multi-line FIDO board ç
for just that purpose and carry over 110 echos and now the FileBone.  I ç
carry everything from AIDS/GENDER/GAY to some of the most right wing stuff ç
ever to cross a CRT.

I find this latest twist disgusting, reprehensible and petty as just a few ç
adjectives that cross my mind.  I wonder if the AIDS echos fought a ç
similar battle.

Just blowing off steam.  I carry the echo as part of my LD effort and will ç
continue to carry it regardless of what petty efforts are made by those in ç
a position "of authority" to stifle communications.  I believe some people ç
do not understand that they are also in a position of "responsibility" - a ç
novel concept.

Btw...good luck with your latest love.  I just about died when I read the ç
last two news issues.  Openness on Fido?

thank you for your time...

   Nice to see homophobia is alive and well in your community...

   Just read your editorial where you mentioned the node/net/whatever that ç
decided to quit distributing FidoNews because of "the fag and his new ç
boyfriend."
   What a hoot!
   Jeeze, I wonder how many people will freak when/if I decide to announce ç
the ZOOPHILE echo in FNEWS?  Maybe you should put me on the FidoNews staff ç
so they can gripe about "the pervert and his four-legged wife," thus ç
drawing the heat off of you?  Sorry, but I find some folks' attitudes ç
absolutely hilarious -- when they aren't downright terrifying!
   Hey, I was glad to see that you found a nice friend and lover.  ç
Everyone needs love; some of us seek it out or discover it in ç
less-than-traditional manners, that's all.  (Some of us in ç
MUCH-less-than-etc., grin.)
 
   Oh, about the proposed echo -- I'm dead serious, but am waiting to hear ç
from Butch Walker exactly how to set it up so that it will be in ç
compliance with backbone policy; i.e., no obscenity, no solicitation or ç
sharing of partners, no pornography exchanges and/or sales ... topics held ç
to support for individuals, sharing of coping strategies, discussion of ç
issues both political and social as applied to "strangelove."  Wonder if I ç
can pull it off?
   I haven't yet decided whether to moderate it as "Hossius Anonymous" or ç
"Dr. Doolittle."  A local user dubbed me the latter as a flame, but I ç
rather like it.

A recent article in fidonews contained the following lines:
"
Well, no scandals, flames, outings, net wars, political conspiracies
this week. Too bad. It's getting quiet around here.
 
Actually, the above reminds me of something Vince Perriello (Josh (my
boyfriend, remember him?) and I had coffee & pizza with Vince in
Seattle) brought up, and I think is so obvious (in hindsight) that I'm
completely amazed I've never heard it before --
"
 
The use of "Josh" without any other form of identification has caused me ç
some problems within the network.  I have had a number of flaming ç
netmails, insults, and I believe I have lost Zone Coordinator position in ç
the network I started.  I believe that you intended no ill towards me, nor ç
any other "Josh"'s in Seattle.  I would appreatiate some clarity of what ç
you meant by this in a upcoming fidonews.  Please note that I have nothing ç
aginst homosexuals...
 
I have been in Austraila for 11 days, to find my BBS crashed (Neighbor did ç
not reset the computer, he reset the VCR!), Zone Coordinator position ç
lost, Fido feed cut... not the kind of things you like to see after 28 ç
hours in a airplane.
(I did warn everybody I was going to Australia)
