Hiya, Don.

Well... I've read yesterday's FidoNews and he (Clovis Lacerda) did it. He 
played his last card in this long and foolish game, leaving me with no choice 
but to fax my attorney in S„o Paulo tomorrow a copy of the article to see what 
he thinks. This is one in long series of attacks within Brazil and the last 
one I'm willing to take. I'm exhausted; I've put a lot of time into FidoNet 
but it's already more than it's worth. 

I will be sending in an article with what I believe is the truth (i.e. Lacerda 
is lying), and I will proceed to file a policy complaint against this bastard 
for the biggest case of defamation I have yet witnessed within FidoNet. 

I had put up my name to cover as ZC until next June and proposing the adoption 
of down-up elections in Zone 1 and knowing that even without that proposal I 
wouldn't get chosen. My idea, as I mentioned to you originally, was to just 
have that proposal on the table when the RCs chose George's replacement, 
hoping the winner would choose to implement it. 

However, now even if offered to be ZC on a salary I wouldn't take it. I'm 
burnt out. Plus I don't want folks without scruples like Lacerda (quite oddly, 
"la cerda" in Spanish means "the pig"... don't ask me what I think about that) 
using it as an excuse for a power grab that was never in mind. 

Hope you understand, Don, why I'm taking a break from the kitchen. Of the ones 
we were back then, Steve Bonine and Felix Kasza, both good chaps, are long 
gone. My time has come, but I will remain in FidoNet, involved in all the fun, 
techie part, and keeping in touch with the old friends I made throughout the 
world. The time for idealism and politics is over, at least for me and for a 
while. 

Please remove my name from the list of prospective Z1Cs and you can copy this 
message to Z1REGCON if you feel it gives the adequate explanation for my 
withdrawal. 

Take care,

          -Pablo

I know you don't care, but this is potentially trouble, and I thought
I'd inform you that Pablo is implying legal action against Clovis
over that goddamned article.

I've included Pablos msg to me below, I'll arrange that there's blank

I mention this because you and I both know he'll drag as many people
as he can into this. I have not responded to this message, nor will
I, though I considered sending a copy to Clovis out of courtesy. I
have not done this however.

The message follows this line.

... Since you allowed Clovis Lacerda to unload his bag of rubbish on last 
week's snooze, I very much hope you will let me and all the other attacked 
parties to defend ourselves at least once in the full-distribution FidoNews. 

I have been defamed in a big way by that article, and so have a few other 
sysops. I expect a chance to defend myself, especially since in this case 
Clovis has not produced a single verifiable truth. 

Thank you.

Private communication, please don't forward!

It is my opinion that Pablo Kleinman is one of the LEAST qualified
people to be Z1C! He is a megalomaniac. He harrasses and distorts to
get his way. I don't know if you saw what he did with his latest
"worldPol" thing, but he added many peoples names against their will.
I mean, I and others told him specifically that I did NOT support his
document and to take my name OFF; a year later it was added (or not
removed in the first place) and he ran it in FidoNews. To him, the
ends justify the means. This is not the sort of person I want in that
position.

I have no stake whatsoever, nor even care about his and Clovis'
troubles in Z4. I think they are *all* idiots.

I have been forced to deal with Pablo over the last few years, and he
ain't no saint. It terrifies me to think he might be considered for
Z1C. 

Can you tell me if he's actually being seriously considered?!

HOLEY SHIT. Did you know that Pablo is being considered for

I've sent queries to David Garrett and Don Dawson both.

NETMAIL            99          -------------------------------

FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION:
-----------------------

Pablo Kleinman
1:102/631


FidoNet Experience:
-------------------
Joined in 1987
Ex-NC 1:368/0 (for about a year in 1987-88)
Ex-RC 1:60/0 (until May 12, 1989) (*)
Ex-ZC 4:4/0 (until June 1, 1991)
Sysop 1:102/631 since June 1991

(*) Region 60 was later transferred to the then newly-created Zone 4, and 
renamed as Region 90.

Goals:
------
1+ To propose to the IC an amendment exclusive to Zone 1 (as
   provided in Policy4) to replace the current election procedures
   with a transitional democratic down-up system:

                   . Local sysops elect NCs
                   . NCs elect RCs
                   . RCs elect ZC

2+ To establish a more reliable method for the worldwide update of
   the nodelist (currently, some zones don't get updated for weeks
   sometimes).

3+ To clean up the zonegate mess by establishing good, strong links
   with the other zones, for so long neglected.

In items 2 and 3 I have experience and a good record. It's not just promises 
but something that would be achieved within a month or else you have my 
resignation. Item 1 will depend on how much collaboration I can get from you 
and the IC.


Self-evaluation:
Pros:
-----
2-year experience as ZC, compiling the zone segment and the master nodelist 
and   

 dealing with the other ZCs. Know and performed all the ZC tasks for 2 years 
with a terrific record of approval by the other *Cs and sysops in general. I 
rarely make decisions on my own, but rather in consultation with the RCs.

Cons:
-----
You'd have to pick a new ZC next year cuz I wouldn't run again after the 
stated   

 goals are achieved. I presume I'm a controversial character for some, and 
this   

 could eventually mean more noise than the usual, plus I'd require each of you 
 
to participate in a Region Coordinator Council (RCC) that would take over the 
non-technical functions of the ZC at the Zone level.

Regards,

          -Pablo

Hello Don,

Is it possible for me to get access to this conference for the period of the 
election/selection?

 DD> about you.  What's your agenda for ZC?  What's your experience in 
 DD> fidonet?  How long have you been an RC?

By now most of you have received my original message of a few days ago. To 
expand on that a little, I would like to talk briefly about some of the 
concerns that I have heard expressed.

Several items have been "on the agenda" for several years without much 
happening. I would like to initiate a LOT of discussion on an ECHOMail Policy 
as well as an update to Policy4. Times are changing and we need to keep 
abreast   

 of the phenomonal growth taking place in our hobby. One of the biggest 
concerns 
 I hear from all over the country is lack of "elections". I am sure that some 
of 
 these concerns are voiced because some of the SYSOP's making the statements 
are 
 not aware of what is happening in FIDONET other what is happening in his/her 
particualr NET. 

I think I mentioned most of my experience in my previous message but will go 
through the highlites once more - 

          An original participant in FIDONET (when there were only Nodes)
          NC of NET 124 (the original "Host")
          NC of NET 388
          NEC of NET 388 (coincided with being NC of this small net)
          RC Region 19
          RC Region 11

I held the FIRST election for RC to replace myself as RC19. Subsequentially, 
Region 11 used the same rules to elect their next RC (me). The ZC at the time 
was in Region 11 and had followed our RC19 election closely to see how 
sucessful it was.

The length of time (total) as an RC was 16 months with only about a month 
between RC19 and being elected as RC11.
 
 DD> guess you'd say that my vote is subject to influence.

And, if this doesn't influence you (or any of you for that matter) you can 
feel   

 FREE to call me at 1-800-899-3585 for specific questions or if you just want 
to 
 chat...

I've not received any additions or other feedback, however, the deadline is 
still 5 days away.

How about a voting procedure?  May I suggest this, due to the # of candidates:

.  Each RC send me netmail with their vote and a password, beginning 11/9
.  The 'winner' is the candidate receiving 50% + 1 of the ballots cast.
.  If no candidate receives the required number, the 3 top candidates will
   participate in a run-off.

How's that?

Thanks.

B-)  Don

Is it really true that Pablo Kleinman is being seriously considered
for Z1C? I can hardly think of anyone worse! He is a complete
magalomniac, and a conniver. He acted very, very unethically with his
"WorldPol" doc, adding on names of people who SPECIFICALLY told him to
remove their names. This war with Clovis in Z4 is another added
attraction. (I think they are *all* idiots, I have no stake nor care
in it.) He has been a troublemaker for years. I have had to cut off
communications with him; he would not back off when I wouldn't help
him or agree with him. He harrasses those who won't further his goals,
whatever they are.

The problem is, he *has* goals of his own for the zone. Namely,
getting his policy in there. Whatever flaws George Peace had, he kept
a pretty good hands-off approach most of the time, and let troubles
be settled locally. (I have no interaction with George other than
occasional netmail over things we were in together otherwise. I am
not in "George's camp", if he even has one.)

Can you tell me whether or not Pablo is really being seriously
considered?!

Dear Tom,

I knew the reactions of Pablo's supporters would be that big. He actually 
asked his followers to send articles to Fidonews, something I could do, but in 
respect to you, I will not send anything. I just want to thank you for your 
attention. My article was most of it supported by evidences from Fidonews, 
while Pablo's was his wonderful speech, as I have predicted. I am sick tired 
of it. Gustavo run away of Fidonet after impeached. I am doing the same right 
now. I got married and my wife is expecting a baby. Great part of my salary is 
spent in this hobby that gives us gifts like these ones. I will probably keep 
my node number as a BBS and install a UUCP gateway here. You may find me in 
Internet, where politics doesn't exist (I got my node and dont' even know who 
my "ZC" is).  Yes, in this point he is right. I wanted to be the ZC to make a 
great work in Z4. But I didn't know I was going to find someone like him. He 
is crazy. 

Thank you very much.

 U> > John Summers of 1:124/4103

A fool. I know him from RBBS sysop meetings in 85. Coarse and not real
smart. Standard issue SWM. Dallas area. Not mafia.

 U> > Henry Clark of 1:124/6119

Well-meaning, but not smart. Dallas, but not mafia. Arranged the
latest FidoCon (w/help). Not the kind of person I'd want running
something complex. 

 U> > Christopher Baker of 1:374/14

* * * A real Good Guy. Long associated with Fido help echo.
*Consistently* douses flames with humor and insight. Thinks Very Well.
Not "worldly" but isn't afraid to make mistakes or learn from others.
He's up there in the all too short list of people I really respect in
FidoLand. Really. A non-politico (ie. not a career type.) Would I
trust him? Yes. Is aware of social/political issues. * * *

 U> > Jesse David Hollington of 1:225/1.1

Fairly unknown, but technical and somewhat level-headed. A canadian I
think. Little experince with him, but he seems possibly
short-tempered, and a technocrat.

 U> > Tim Pearson of 1:286/703

Absolutely no knowledge.

Thanks for the note and vote of confidence. Chris decided that he had his card 
full with the recent election to RC18 so he withdrew from consideration for 
Z1C. I bet he'll be back on the list next May when we get to have another 
election.  

be well...

Pablo withdrew himself from consideration.  See following message.  It 
indicates he cc:d you. 

B-)  Don

"Disculpa" in Spanish means "apology." Boy, aren't we so tempted to go read 
that piece? :)

Tom,

Pablo is a candidate.  I don't think that he is seriously being considered 
though (at least by myself). 

Thanks for the note.
