        purpose of providing the BBS community a means of protecting it's 
        self from the recurrent fraudulent actions of a rogue SysOp. It's 
        a pretty sordid tale.

             We the authors of the file feel that finding and 
        apprehending the person described in these documents is of strong 
        importance in keeping the BBS community a self policing arena 
        rather than a government mandated community.

             We therefore solicit the BBSing community to give this file 
        the widest possible distribution.
