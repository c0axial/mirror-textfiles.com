Subj: suspect situation

Tom,

My name is Maynard Riley; I'm officiating an election for NC in Chicago ç
Net 115. 

Joel Veeneman and Lew Prather are the run-off candidates in the second ç
round of voting.

Rick Thelen is a local SWASHy (SWASHnet NC around here I understand) who ç
has sent the following message via netmail to other SWASHnet members who ç
are also in FidoNet.

Rick's message espouses that you support Joel's position against ç
discrimination against sysops with affiliations in other networks. (Joel ç
is local RC in some other network, not SWASH). However, Rick's message is ç
worded to appear that you support his views against "banishment" as listed.
 
Rick is incorrect when he says that there is current discussion on the ç
"banishment" issues. The only such discussion in progress has been one ç
where folks are discussing measures to keep underage kids from viewing ç
inappropriate GIFs.
 

I would appreciate your response to this situation.

     ~-Maynard Riley

Rick's message follows::::::

 * Originally by Rich Thelen, 1:115/904
 * Originally dated 28 Oct 1991, 10:52

The election for NET115 NC was held and a runoff will be required.

          Joel Veeneman   -  16 votes
          Lew Prather     -  14 votes
          Andy Lester     -  10 votes

We can expect most of the Lester votes to go to Prather, so your vote is ç
needed more than ever.  There will be sweeping changes to the politics of ç
the net if Lew is elected.  For instance, the following things are ç
actively being discussed:

1.  Banish all nodes who carry adult GIFs or adult material
2.  Banish all nodes who carry pirate files
3.  Banish any nodes who supports illegal behaviour of any kind
4.  Banish nodes who carry software un-protects
5.  Make it difficult or near impossible for new nodes who are part
     of other nets from joining Fido.

Remember, they have already banished one node because he was in another ç
net.  It could have happened to anyone, even you.

Joel Venneman is opposed to this witch hunting fever and will not tolerate ç
it to exist while he is NC.  The founder of Fido [Tom Jennings] and George ç
Peace both support Joel's policies.  He will need your vote to be able to ç
end the witch hunting.

Vote for Joel Veeneman.  I have included a ballot if you did not get one. ç
Voting closes Nov. 2 1991.  Please vote.

Thanks for writing me!!! Oh, how I hate this sort of thing... not just 
the using my name bit, but the whole concept of "banishment". Violent 
thoughts come to mind...

Did you cc: Georce Peace? He gets tons of stuff, so you should get the 
gist of the problem into (literally) one sentence ... "You are quoted 
as supporting an NC-candidates position; did you do this? Text 
follows" etc ...

I do thank you 1,000,000 X for sending me the message... if I sound 
angry I am, but not at you!!!!!! You can remain anonymous if you so 
desire, since I realize you have to live with idiots like this, but 
making it all public usually works better... your call.

The message I'm delivering follows separately.

Could you please confirm receipt of this message ASAP? What are its 
chances for getting to thje other nodes in your net if I send one for 
every node to 115/0? (ie will they host route properly). Can you get 
copies out to them?

I can arrange to copy your message here to anyone you wish. Hub-routing ç
here is working. Not everyone will need one, because the message which ç

No disagreement on this, Tom. The author of the message I sent you was not ç
advocating banishment; rather he rails against it, and makes long litanies ç
about first amendment freedoms. The problem is that he's using it all to ç
support his right to engage in illegal activities.
 
It boils down to one simple question:
 
Can FidoNet tolerate "pirate" systems which are known to engage in the ç
transfer of files in violation of license agreements, and other illegal ç
activities ?
 
I get so tired of hearing the excuse that "I didn't pay the license fee, ç
so I'm not violating anything by letting you pick up a copy of this."

George,

Referring to a message which I sent to you (at 1/0) on 10/28 wherein I ç
copied a message being netmailed around behind an election I'm overseeing ç
for NC in Net 115,

wherein the author used your name and a first amendment stance to state ç
opposition to what he called "banishment" of systems,

as a protection of his "right" to:

     "carry pirate files" and
     "support illegal behavior of any kind"

I'd appreciate your response to this situation.

Subj: Othernet affiliation/ Net 115 issue
^AMSGID: 1:115/639@fidonet 990e5413
Tom -

 I am the local net 115 candidate for whom Rich Thelen (1:115/904) wrote ç
the letter you quoted (I received your response today). Although I had ç
nothing
to do with the creation of the letter, and it's obvious that some parts of
Rich's letter are complete misrepresentations, I thought you might want to
know the circumstances which prompted the creation of the letter.

Earlier this year, a sysop named Adam Lyons (a teenager in suburban ç
Chicago) was admitted to Fidonet, after successful completion of the very ç
few requirements we have here - minimum technical compliance and a valid ç
phone number are about all that's needed here. Very soon after his ç
entrance, a policy complaint was filed against Adam by aother sysop, Steve ç
Levinthal, complaining that Adam was using the address of an othernet ç
(known as Swashnet) to connect with Steve while transferring Fidonet ç
echomail. Steve's complaint stated that the fact that Adam belonged to an ç
organization rumored to have dealings in software piracy and other illegal ç
acts constituted excessively annoying behavior, especially when evidence ç
of such affiliation was used in Fidonet transfers. N115C Jerry Callahan ç
agreed with Steve, and removed Adam from the nodelist. A number of 115 ç
sysops, including Rich and myself, were rather distraught at that ç
decision, and counseled Adam to appeal the decision to R11C, Mark Lynch. ç
Mark overturned the decision, and directed Jerry to reinstate Adam under a ç
different HUB, so that Steve would not be in direct contact with Adam. ç
[For informational purposes, I am now Adam's HUB].

As a result of the controversy surrounding this issue, the net has ç
essentially split onto two factions: one supporting the NC's decision, the ç
other supporting the RC's. As Jerry is now retiring from the NC post, the ç
two remaining candidates (we are now in an election runoff) represent each ç
side of this issue.

I was distraught when I was forwarded a copy of the letter Rich wrote, as ç
I knew that Rich had probably not contacted you or George Peace, and so ç
therefore was in error in using your names in the letter.  I feel some ç
responsibility for the appearance of the letter, as it was designed to aid ç
my chances of winning the election, so I offer you my humblest personal ç
apologies for the use of your name. I feel it is important, however, that ç
you know the facts behind this issue, and, if you loke, I will be more ç
than happy to keep you up-to-date on this issue as it unfolds.

Thanks much for your attention,

Joel Veeneman

You have my apology for insinuating that you had chosen sides.  The
text is a little ambiguous, but my intention was to state that your ç
position (well known from FidoNews) was similar to Joel's.

I have carried this out except for those who received unauthorized copies ç
of my original private netmail transmission (whose identities I am not ç
aware of).  The original addresses have received a copy.

I thank you for agreeing with this principle so completely.  I am sorry ç
that you had to be dragged into this fight.  It certainly was not my ç
intention.  My reference to your name and views was to your own public ç
statements.  I am sorry that the ambiguity misled anyone.

Hi, Tom.  Since I happen to be a member of net 115,  I thought I could add ç
a little information to what you have heard so far.

Neither Lew Prather (the newly elected NC) nor Jerry Callahan (the current ç
NC) has EVER called for the bannishment of ANYONE,  regardless of ç
provocation.  Period.  Lew campaigned on a minimalist,  ç
non-interventionist platform - it is indeed comical that the letter you ç
were shown supported a candidate that wants to substantially increase the ç
activities of the NC (read bureaucracy,  at least to me) including ç
dropping boards from the nodelist that do not live up to his standards (to ç
paraphrase of his words).

Since you are pretty familar with my views on the desirability of anarchy ç
in FidoNet,  you can be sure you will hear from me if any NC in net 115 ç
ever decides to do anything like Richard Thelan assuses Lew Prather of ç
wanting to do.  Fortunately for us,  now that Lew has been elected,  you ç
can rest assured that nothing whatever of this sort will occur as long as ç
Lew is NC.



Rick
