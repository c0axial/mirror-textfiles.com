I am forwarding you the next six messages because I was a little concerned ç
with Bill's warning about documents authored by JoHo and published using ç
your marks by me. I have no idea if there's any reason to worry about ç
getting involved in senseless bullshit, but when lawyers (I pronounce it ç
as "liars" myself <g>) are involved, you have to be careful. Maybe you ç
want to make check with check with your lawyer and make sure that nothing ç
I do can get you tangled up in legallistic red tape.

I have absolutely no reason to believe or disbelieve the "facts" presented ç
in these messages. As far as I'm concerned, JoHo is innocent until proven ç
guilty in a court of law, and even then I may still not believe he is ç
guilty. I really don't know enough first hand to make a judgement. I'm not ç
trying to spread gossip (the messages have obviously received wide ç
distribution in zone 3 already and will probably be here in zone 1 soon). ç
It's just I take our agreement seriously and don't want to cause you any ç
legal problems.

I intend to go on publishing anything I receive that I feel has some ç
connection to FTSC's charter. The only exceptions are documents that ç
encourage or aid illegal conduct, documents that I do not receive directly ç
from the author, documents that are obviously copyrighted by other ç
entities, or documents that contain obscenity (and I'm no prude) or ç
personal attacks that could be considered libel. To date, I have published ç
every word I have received.

On another topic: would you like me to submit documents I publish to you ç
as FidoNews articles?  It might carry the discussion of new proposals to ç
more people around the world.

I hope you and your loved ones had a good holiday season.



Rick

Rick,

I am passing on the message below (and in the following five parts) for ç
your information.

This involves commercial rather than technical issues and so you can make ç
of it what you will.  I thought you might want to be aware of it as it ç
potentially effects the distribution in Zone 3 (possibly elsewhere as ç
well) of items JoHo provided to FTSC during his period in Australia.  Both ç
FSC-0046.A02 and FSC-0053.A01 fall into this category.

Cheers,

Bill

                               MEMO

        INTRODUCTION

        From what I can understand, people that are involved in the ç
Fidonet community and particularly those involved with and using the Front ç
Door and Tosscan products have been over the past year getting conflicting ç
and contradictory reports about Front Door (FD), its ownership ,its ç
distribution and the rights to sell Front Door. To date I have refrained ç
from entering into or disclosing any details about FD , about Joaquim (JH) ç
and my involvement with the Front Door project . I had been counselled by ç
my lawyers that such a delicate and legal matter was best disclosed and ç
thrashed out in the court rooms and that the Fidonet network was not the ç
correct forum for disclosing information. I have always been aware of the ç
fact that large sections of the people involved in the Fidonet network ç
thrive on gossip and innuendo and generally have nothing better to do than ç
to fabricate and spread false , malicious, slanderous and damaging ç
information about other people. Because of this, I have also refrained, ç
not wanting to be seen to have stooped to this level. Furthermore being ç
largely involved in the commercial world I am also aware of the potential ç
for libel .

        Having said all of the above then why have I now decided that the ç
TRUE facts about Front Door, Joaquim and myself need to be spelled out. ç
The reason is simple. Having already lost a fortune to Joaquim I have ç
nothing left to lose but my name and reputation and it is THIS very thing ç
above ALL else that has prompted me to finally disclose the facts about ç
the Front Door Project and Joaquim. In the business world THE most ç
important asset a person has is not his money but his name and his ç
reputation. Therefore rather than have my name and reputation maligned, ç
sullied and misconstrued because people are not aware of or not in ç
possesion of the true and full facts , I have decided  to provide it. They ç
say that the beginning of wisdom is to call a thing by its right name so ç
in this case let me present the facts to you and then you can arrive at an ç
informed opinion about the matter on your own.

        THE BACKGROUND

        About 3 or more years ago a Mr. Peter Stewart was approached by ç
Joaquim to be involved in developing an E-Mail system. Peter was involved ç
as a full partner and they jointly developed the Front Door package up to ç
the release of ver 1.99c. The development of FD was along the following ç
lines. Peter Stewart developed

               The Interface
               the Mailer
               the Nodelist compiler
               and the Editor

        Joaquim developed Front Doors Setup program and some of the ç
Protocols. The FUNDING for this development came from a number of sources. ç
It was not funded by Joaquim. At the end of the 1.99c development JH ç
proceeded too end the partnership with Peter Stewart. Through David Nugent ç
I invited Joaquim to Australia to do some software development. At this ç
stage I had other projects I was interested in doing . When Joaquim came ç
to Australia he convinced  me into funding the next version of Front Door. ç
His convincing arguments were that he or at least James had about 600 ç
orders ready to be fulfilled IF ONLY WE HAD VER 2.00. We felt that Front ç
Door should be developed along commercial lines with a lot more commercial ç
features and requirements than it had at the time. I had at this stage ç
already PAID for Joaquims  airfare to come to Australia. For the next 12 ç
months I PAID Joaquim a weekly WAGE while he developed what became to be ç
called Front Door ver 2.00.

The other major components that I paid to have developed
for ver 2.00 was

               1. All programming work done between 1.99c and 2.0
               2. FDCD ( The Communications Driver)
               3. The Install program
               4. The Documentation

        The total cost to date was around $140,000.00. This figure does not
include Opportunity costs or Interest rates. If these were considered then ç
the
figure would be closer to $250,000.00

        It may come as a surprise to some of you that a large part of the
commercial ideas that went into ver 2.0 came from David Nugent. Any of you ç
who
have known David well , know that he is a fountain of ideas both ç
conceptually
and technically. The balance came from a group of well known beta testers.

        Some time in July of 1990 JH and myself signed some preliminary ç
legal
documents . When version 2.00 was officially released I had some additional
legal documents prepared. These documents detailed the amount of monies ç
spent
on the ver 2.00 project by myself. It also detailed a royalty scheme that
Joquim had to comply to. The Agreement ensured that I retained OWNERSHIP ç
of all
  the components that I paid for until Joaquim had paid IN FULL the amounts
outstanding.

        To date and almost one year later I have not received ONE CENT in
royalty payments from Joaquim as per our agreement. I have tried everything
possible outside the legal channels to ensure that he repays the money but ç
to
no avail. It has therefore become obvious that I have been taken as a ç
sucker
and for a ride and that Joaquim never ever did intend to repay back any of ç
the
moneys that were lent to him or used to fund the project.

        My buisness relationships with people have always been above board ç
and done with the gentlemans handshake.

        It should be pointed out  that as a direct result of my investing ç
in the Front Door ver 2.00 and because the completion of the project took ç
6 months longer than it should , I eventually lost my family home and ç
other assets.

        Over the past 5 months I have since discovered that there are at ç
least FIVE other people and companies that have been in my situation with ç
Joaquim. These people and companies have over the past 3 to 4 years lent ç
him money or funded the development of Front Door. On every occassion ç
legal documents were signed and verbal promises made and on EVERY ç
occassion Joaquim has broken his promise. Why does He now live in ç
Luxembourg ? Because the legal jurisdiction makes it a very expensive ç
exercise for anyone chasing him to recover monies.

        THE CURRENT LEGAL POSITION

        So what is the current situation with front Door and myself? . ç
Well the answer is as follows

        a. Joaquim has been stopped from using the following components in ç
Front Door

               1. FDCD (the communications driver)
               2. The Install programme
               3. The manual/documentation or any derivation of the manual

        b. I currently own the name Front Door for the area of Australia. ç
As a result no one will be allowed to use the name in a product or in any ç
literature , advertising etc.

        c. I retain , pursuant to signed documents and due to a legally ç
enforceable agreement between Joaquim and myself the exclusive ç
distribution and liscenscee of the Front Door packaging. At this point in ç
time we are in dispute with Joaquim and are currently enforcing our rights ç
in the Australian Courts. Joaquim has elected NOT to come within the ç
jurisdiction of the Australian Courts. Given the amount of expenditure and ç
investment made by myself we herby give notice that Joaquim is NOT ç
entitled to give licenses or sell Front Door in Australia, New Zealand or ç
anywhere else in the world without my express consent. In the event that ç
any person purports to hold such a license or attempts to distribute , ç
market or sell Front Door , legal proceedings will be issued against them ç
and this letter or Electronic mail will be used as proof of PRIOR ç
knowledge. d. As far as we can tell it is unclear as to WHO REALLY OWNS ç
the rights to Front Door. It would appear that the rights are held by more ç
than one person and company that aided in the development and funding of ç
the product.

        THE ALTERNATIVE

        As a result of all of the above, I no longer sell or support Front ç
Door . This decision was VOLUNTARY and not enforced on me by JH since I ç
still have the legal rights to duplicate and manufacture Front Door. I ç
have however chosen to market a product called INTERMAIL. Intermail is a ç
package written and developed by Mr. Peter Stewart who as you recall was ç
the joint developer of Front Door up to version 1.99c. In my brief ç
association with Peter over the past 4 months I have found him to be an ç
absolute gentleman and honourable in all his dealings. For those who have ç
not seen Intermail it looks and feels exactly like Front Door. Intermail ç
has many advantages over Front Door. But one of the main advantages is ç
that it is jointly owned and supported by a company called Scandinavian PC ç
who is a $30 million dollar company and the largest software publisher in ç
Scandinavia. Their commitment to the product will ensure that it will ç
develop faster and be a more commercially viable product than Front Door ç
ever will. Front Door is NOT well funded and if all the people that it ç
owes money to win their legal case then Front Door will be even poorer for ç
it. We estimate that Joaquim owes about $500,000.00 to people that have ç
helped him and the Front Door project and this does not include the ç
accuring interest.
