A message entitled 'The Facts of Life' with the author of Thomç
Henderson   recently swept across the net. This message was in factç
not penned by Mr.   Henderson. It was an attempt by ourselves to implyç
that the recent  illicit  activities taking place in the net wereç
caused by Mr. Henderson. This  has  never been proven.   The messageç
in question was in fact written by the two of us. We have no   excuseç
other than our own childish stupidity. This has resulted in our own  ç
More[Y,n]  discredit. We can only offer our sincere apologies to Mr.ç
Wong and Mr.   Henderson. In addition, we apologize to the entireç
network for our infantile   behavior. This could only take place givenç
the current level of distrust  and  deceit in the network.   In lightç
of the actions we have taken, and the blow that our credibility has  ç
taken, we find it necessary to step down from our respective positionsç
in  the  network. The positions of "Opus_INFO 'here'", Nationalç
Echomail  Coordinator,  and Sysop Echomail Moderator are now vacant.ç
We trust you will  make the proper  choices for the new appointees forç
these positions.    
	Sincerely,    
	David Finster

Well, that thing by Finster ... I know he may be a friend of yours,ç
and I  wont say Im glad, but I feel somewhat satisfied tat they mangedç
managed to go  one step too far. Finster did some terrible attacks onç
me and others,  including Ken Kaplan, as low as racial slurs in someç
cases. Very bad vibes to  say the least. He made things up from wholeç
cloth. I skip this, its old news,  old sores.  Just a reminder thatç
things like this have happened, info was fabricated, and  that peopleç
should watch what people DO, not what they MIGHT or COULD do.  Thisç
isnt "to" you, this is just a passing comment, really! There's no tç
many  that would understand it, thats all, since very few people aroudç
today saw  that stuff. Thats all!
