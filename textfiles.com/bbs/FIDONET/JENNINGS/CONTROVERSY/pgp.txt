Sorry about that Tom. I just cannot understand what all this
fuss is about. I would think that encrypting messages would take all legal 
obligations off the intermediate system, assuming that something illegal was 
being said in such messages, and that's not the case anyway. 

I have apologosed to Mr. Samet just to make sure.

In the future, just make any replies a HOLD and I normally pick up fidonews 
once a week from you, so I would get any messages in a fairly quick manner, or 
you may send them thru Chris Baker(1:374/14),assuming that a link to him is 
available to you. I poll his system for mail almost daily anyway. 

My NEC (1:135/41) participates in that voluntary routing scheme that uses the 
BACKBONE, but I believe he feels the same way as Mr.Samet as far as encrypted 
mail goes. 

You know, this is really a shame, because people should really be cooperating 
to ensure other people's privacy. It seems to me, that this is the same group 
of people that later complain when their rights have been eroded , to the 
extent that they notice in their every day affairs. 

For the life of me, I fail to see what is so damaging about privacy to these 
people.

For your use, I have enclosed in the next block my complete public key ring.

Paul Schencke

ps. Please keep this message between us, I have no intention to upset the 
local bosses for now.

Policy 4 benefits noone but /0's. 

It also is quite clear that the NEC (I assume) is rummaging through
people's mail. I would like to make a big deal of this. Unless you
object, I'd like to use your message, but I will remove all
references to your name, node number and anything else you think will
identify you. If you think even this is too much exposure, please say
so. I won't do anything until you msg me back.


It would be nice though if you would inform PUBLIC_KEYS of this...
it's exactly what this is all about. Freedom doesn't come to the
meek... it must be worked for at every step.

This is the crux of carrier vs. publisher status for in-transit
email.

It's not harmful, it's like assuming tht letters in envelopes are
hiding something. Prior restraint. If we were doing something
illegal, there are laws and systems to deal with this. Sysops ain't
cops.

 MD> How goes the PGP debates?  Also, think I should work on

Hey, go ahead, I think we need key repositories. I'm just opposed to
centralization, in general, but specifically here. I think our needs
are not that stringent IN GENERAL. Redundancy solves problems, and
the neural-net of human social structures will solve detected
problems, if the underlying mini-bureaucracies don't prevent them. 

I think relaxing errors (duplicate keys) to "excuse me I think you
made a mistake" (eg. assume that someone screwed up when an identical
ID appears, rather than assuming it's intentional (even if it is!)),
an askance approach, works better. What we're doing is making a social
structure explicit, the behind the scenes way we do business ("OK,
I'll introduce you to so and so, tell 'em I sent you", at a meeting,
you pull someone back a few paces and explain or make deals, etc, that
is how things *really* work. Even screwed up companies can make good
stuff, and we all know the MBA types can organize things into the
ground. Hell, if bureaucracy was the solvent, Ford would be selling
cars, and the FidoNet would have halted from lack of interest. 

New problems, new approaches... my guess is, after the enthusiasm
dies, and everyone's sick of colliding keys and confusion, a few
different repositories, possibly taking different approaches but
sharing verified keyrings, will be used, and the keys you keep on hand
will be relatively few. Gettting to that point however won't be the
obvious path. Change happens one miserable step at a time, and along
the way ya gotta make sure the Shits don't get their hands on things.
By establish openness and trust as the coin o fthe realm, the
bastards who work by conniving (lots of *Cs, for instance) can't work
so well. Those things work best in the dark. 

Notice just who it is in FIdoNet that hates all this. They always
seem to have a /0 on their address somewhere. Coincidence?!

I'm sorry Tom, but it cannot be read by anyone with your public key.  They 
also need to have and install special software that's not part of the minimum 
FTS-001 coimpliant software set required for all Fidonet systems. 

I respectfully decline to pass this traffic thru my system, and I'm returning 
it.

If you wish to send plain-text messages, so that I can verify that they comply 
with Policy4 requirements regarding illegal and commercial traffic, they will 
be delivered without problems. ;Via FrontDoor 1:135/41, Oct 17 1992 at 22:36

No mail has been killed. It's been returned as undeliverable because it fails 
to meet the requirements set forth in Policy4 for transmission. 

Policy4 clearly states that Fidonet mail is not private mail as defined under 
the law, that routing nodes have the right to review mail for illegal and 
commercial content, and that mail not be encrypted without approval of the 
nodes it's routed thru. 

As far as I'm concerned, your unauthorized transmission of encrypted mail thru 
my system is an unauthorized use of my computer, and a violation of Florida's 
Computer Crimes Laws.

Well, at this point it's kinda useless. Mr. Samet has informed the NET today 
that he quits his job as NC and to hold elctions pronto! 

I dunno if this had anything to do with it, but he seems to be a very tired 
man (tired of it all, I guess). 

In any case, I bet you some floppies this will not be the last time we see 
such a case.
