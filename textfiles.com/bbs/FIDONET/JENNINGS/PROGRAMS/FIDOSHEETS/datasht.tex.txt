\fido\ is a software package for DOS based Personal Computers thatç
contains a complete Bulletin Board System plus a fully automaticç
Electronic Mail system. 

Fido is the most popular Bulletin Board system in the world because ofç
its flexibility, reliability, and features; FidoNet is the softwareç
that defined the FidoNet protocol now in use around the world. Theç
worlds largest privately-owned computer network is based upon theç
FidoNet communications protocol.

\item{\blob}200 independent message \& file areas
\item{\blob}Complete Email and message commands
\item{\blob}Fully error correcting file transfer protocols
\item{\blob}Supports all DOS/MSDOS Personal Computers
\enddeclare

Fido is a full-featured Computer Bulletin Board System. Callers,ç
commands, message and file areas can all have separate privilegeç
levels and Locks \& Keys applied to them; these let you limit callers'ç
access to any part of the Fido system to fit your needs.

\enddeclare

FidoNet is an automatic ``store-and-forward'' mail system thatç
transfers messages and files with other Fido\-Net-equipped computers.ç
It is completely integrated with Fido, and completely transparent inç
operation, and if you don't use it, you won't even know it's there.

\section{System Description}
\subheading{\fido} is extremely easy to use, and is compatible withç
just about any users terminal program or computer. The user interfaceç
does not get in the way of communicating; there are only two levels ofç
menus. Users see only what they need; novices find an easy toç
understand selection of simple commands, and experts can choose aç
brief prompt. Context sensitive help is available at all decisionç
points. You can have up to 16 different languages or graphicalç
interfaces installed at once.

\subheading{Reliability:} \fido\ is designed first and foremost forç
reliability, meaning it will run 24 hours a day for months at a timeç
with no human intervention. (Obviously this doesn't include respondingç
to callers questions or other such things.) Tools are provided thatç
handle all routine maintenance tasks automatically.

\subheading{Performance:} \fido\ makes excellent use of ordinaryç
computers; with a high-performance modem such as a US Robotics Courierç
Dual Standard, you will get kilobyte/second throughput on a so-calledç
``turbo'' PC XT. 

\subheading{More than one modem:} While \fido\ supports only oneç
modem, you can run more than one copy of \fido\ per computer using aç
multitasker program. \fido\ prevents file and message ``collisions''ç
when more multiple users are accessing the same messages and files.ç
Performance degradation is negligible. See ``Supported Operatingç
Systems'' for the current list of supported multitaskers.

\subheading{Low disk space overhead:} A 20 Megabyte hard disk isç
essentially unlimited space; room for thousands of messages, files, aç
10,000+ node FidoNet network, with plenty of disk space left over.

For a sample ``small scale'' system, with only two 360K floppies andç
256K of memory, there is room for all of the basic \fido\ systemç
utilities plus your text editor and other tools, over 200 messages,ç
and close to 100K bytes free. The same system with a 1,600 nodeç
FidoNet Network can have approximately 80 messages, would beç
considered very ``tight''.

\subheading{Modem Handling:} \fido\ achieves extremely highç
reliability with ordinary modems. During idle periods, \fido\  ``talksç
to'' the modem to make sure it is ready and working. (While of courseç
modems are not supposed to misbehave, in real life they can getç
confused by callers' strange and incompatible modems, improperç
operation, bad phone lines, and bad modem design, and newer-modelç
modems frequently have firmware bugs. \fido\ takes care of theseç
things automatically. Almost all problems reported are modem-relatedç
problems!)

Incoming callers' baud rate is determined automatically; callers doç
not have to hit the ``ENTER'' key to get the systems attention.ç
Outgoing calls made by FidoNet (if so enabled) can take advantage ofç
busy detect, no-dial-tone, and other features if provided by theç
modem.

\subheading{Caller DataBase:} Each caller to the system has a recordç
in a database that maintains each callers name, password, 
terminal-specific settings, language selection, privilege levels andç
controls, and various statistics. Tools provided manipulate theseç
records both manually and automatically. There can be up to 65,535ç
callers in the database.

\subheading{System Messages and Bulletins:} \fido\ uses ordinary textç
files for system messages and bulletins, which are meant to beç
customized by you. When displaying and entering text, the Fido takesç
into account each callers terminal settings, such as screen width andç
length, and performs on-screen formatting for a clean display.

\subheading{Access Controls:} There are six privilege levels thatç
callers can be assigned. You can specify minimum privilege levelsç
needed to access commands and message and file areas.

In addition to privilege levels, there are 32 ``locks'' with matchingç
``keys''. Locks are be applied to things such as commands and messageç
and file areas; callers may be given any number of keys. Callers canç
access only those things for which they have all of the matching keys,ç
plus meet the privilege level requirements. For example, if the {\ttç
E)nter-Message} command has lock \#20 applied, only callers that haveç
Key \#20, plus any necessary minimum privilege levels, can use, see orç
get help with that command.

Limits can be placed on each callers' connect-time on the system 
per-call and per-24-hour period, and on file downloads. 

\subheading{Context-Sensitive Help System:} Help is 
context-sensitive, taking into account what commands the caller hasç
access to because of privilege levels or locks and keys. Help isç
available on every command in the system. The Help files are textç
files that can be customized to fit your specific needs.

\subheading{Message Areas:} There can be up to 200 separate messageç
areas, each with access controls as described above. There can be upç
to 65,535 messages in each area. Callers can enter new messages,ç
modify existing saved messages, search for messages by keyword or asç
addressed to or from them, and perform many other operations uponç
messages. (Command availability depending on privilege levels andç
locks of course.) Help is available at all decision points. 

\subheading{File Areas:} There can be up to 200 independent fileç
areas, with access controls as described earlier. There are a numberç
of ways in which to make files available (or not) to callers. Commandsç
and functions have been added to make remote maintenance of file areasç
and other parts of the disk easier for the system operator. Files canç
be uploaded and downloaded in ASCII, ZMODEM, XMODEM, Telink, ``MODEMç
BATCH'' or Kermit protocols. XMODEM is nearly universal, and canç
handle binary files; ZMODEM has performance to match high-performanceç
modems; Kermit and ASCII are used between otherwise-incompatibleç
computers.

My ``FidoTerm'' program works well with \fido\ or any other modemç
based system.

\subheading{Programmed events:} There can be up to 100 ``Events'',ç
scheduled to run at any time of the day and any day of the week.ç
Events allow \fido\ to run FidoNet network mail, execute externalç
programs via DOS Batch Files, and other events for various specialç
purposes. The events system can handle simultaneous and/or overlappingç
events, special ``optional'' events, and combinations of events andç
special characteristics. (``Optional'' events can be used, forç
example, to execute ``background'' FidoNet network activity while noç
caller is otherwise occupying the system.)

\subheading{Other Features \& Enhancements:} You can sign in to theç
system from the local keyboard, as if you had called in remotely withç
a modem, without ``taking down'' the system. Upcoming events can beç
listed, and previously-run events can be reenabled from the localç
keyboard.

Fido works with external ``shell'' programs to allow programmers andç
``aftermarket'' add-on programs to work with \fido. Technicalç
information is available in the manual. (External ``shell'' supportç
programs are not supplied by me.)

\section{FidoNet}
Using Fido, you enter messages, choosing the destination computer(s)ç
from a list; later, FidoNet automatically transfers those messages toç
the destination computers. You can ``attach'' files to a message toç
transfer files of any kind, and \fido\ will transfer hten along withç
the messages. \fido\ will inform you when the message (and files, ifç
any) has been successfully sent. There can be any number ofç
messages\slash files pending to any number of destination computers.ç
FidoNet's routing language and other resources let you control exactlyç
how and when FidoNet messages are sent. All transfers use errorç
correction for absolute reliability\footnote*{Fido supports both theç
original and universal FidoNet protocol, as well as the WaZooç
protocol, developed by Wynn Wagner.}.

FidoNet networks can be organized into ``Nets'' andç
``Regions''\footnote{**}{FidoNet also has ``Zones'', groups of Netsç
and Regions, that handle the problems of intercontinental traffic;ç
differences in time zones, incompatible modems, outgoing ``gateways''ç
for lowest cost, and so on.}, each of which can contain any number ofç
computers running the \fido\ software, or compatibles, one of which isç
designated Host for the Net. A Host receives mail for the entire Net,ç
and distributes the mail to its local FidoNet computers. FidoNet isç
intelligent enough to send all messages for a given net in one phoneç
call; you can get further efficiency with the routing language. 

FidoNet networks can be as small as two or three computers, or asç
large or larger than the hobbiest FidoNet network, which is up toç
10,000 systems as of March 1991.

\subheading{Incoming FidoNet mail at any time:} \fido\ can receiveç
mail from other \fido\ systems at any time a caller is not occupyingç
the system, not just during scheduled FidoNet events. Optionally,ç
\fido\ can execute external programs via a DOS Batch File to doç
special processing of unscheduled Incoming Mail.

\section{Customization}
\fido\ parameters, lists of events, command names, and message andç
file area definitions are contained in text files you can change withç
your own text editor program. All message and file areas are definedç
in one text file; the \fido\ system takes care of creating andç
verifying the actual DOS subdirectories used. Commands are in theirç
own text file, along with any privilege levels and locks. You canç
change command names to any single word you choose.

\subheading{Multiple Languages:} \fido\ supports up to 16 languagesç
and/or graphical interfaces. Interfaces accomodate both ANSI/colorç
variations of one language (eg. all english, but color, monochrome,ç
standard Fido interface) or multiple languages (English, German,ç
Dutch, Spanish, etc) or any combination. 

When a caller selects a language, the any or all parts of theç
interface can be changed; all runtime messages, command names, helpç
files, system bulletins. (For example, when running ANSI/colorç
variations of one language, the command names should not change; whenç
changing languages changing command names may be part of the goal.)

The following interfaces are available at this time:
\smallskip

\begindoublecolumns
\declare
\item{\blob} American English
\item{\blob} American English Color \#1
\item{\blob} American English Color \#2
\item{\blob} ANSI Monochrome
\item{\blob} Bahasa Malay

\item{\blob} Danish
\item{\blob} Dutch
\item{\blob} Dutch color
\item{\blob} German
\item{\blob} German color

\enddeclare
\enddoublecolumns

Chinese BIG-5 requires a special BIG-5 CODE ROM and programs, notç
available from me. The master American language files are availableç
for custom translations; please contact me for details.

\section{Programs Supplied with \fido}
The following are some of the programs supplied as part of theç
standard \fido\ system package. In addition, there are manyç
``aftermarket'' programs from other authors that make using andç
maintaining \fido\ easier and more powerful. 

You can schedule Events in \fido\ to execute these or other programsç
at any time, using an MSDOS Batch File you create to make your systemç
completely or partially automatic.

\program{MSGMGR.EXE} (the Message Manager) performs routineç
maintenance on messages within \fido\ Message Areas, such as purgingç
messages by age, and renumbering messages so they are sequential.ç
MSGMGR has it's own text file of commands that tells it what to do. 

\program{SYSOP.EXE} is a database-like tool for managing the callerç
database that contains the names, passwords and statistics and otherç
information on each caller. You can enter new callers, delete existingç
callers one by one or by time since last logged in; set callerç
privilege level and assign Keys; force callers into specific messageç
and file areas; and many more functions. There is also an ``undo''ç
feature and context sensitive help.

\program{FIDOMAIL.EXE} lets you create FidoNet network messages withç
your own text editor or word processor. For example, during the dayç
you can create text files destined for other FidoNet network nodes,ç
and via an Event, have FidoMail put them into the FidoNet messageç
system.

\program{TWIX.EXE} prints FidoNet network mail newly received on yourç
printer or in a disk file you specify.

\newpage

\section{Software Policy}

This is the software policy for the \fido\  package. Please read itç
carefully.

First:

Hobbyists run Bulletin Boards for their own personal reasons. Theirç
Bulletin Board is not associated with their employer or any business.ç
How they run their Bulletin Board is none of my business, ie. private,ç
public, subscription or chattel slavery.

Commercial users are companies, corporations, proprietorships or  anyç
other business entities that run a BBS, either publicly or privately,ç
associated with their business. ``Non-profit'' and ``not for profit''ç
organizations are included in this category.

And here's the deal:

\subheading{Hobbyists and Individuals:} \fido\ is shareware; theç
latest version of the software, minus documentation, can always beç
found on the Fido Software BBS. There is no downloadableç
documentation. (If you thought the version 11 docs were unwieldy\dots)ç
You must register the software for \$39.95; in return you will receiveç
the latest version on diskette plus printed and bound documentation.ç
If you later desire updates via diskette instead of download, sendç
\$15 plus the original diskettes or other proof of purchase.

\subheading{Commercial Users:} \fido\ is a usual licensable product;ç
the license fee is \$199.95. You will receive the latest softwareç
version, complete documentation, and support via the Fido Softwareç
BBS. (This has proved to be more than adequate for over two years.)ç
Updates can be obtained by downloading, or via diskette for \$25 plusç
the original Fido Software diskette or other proof of purchase.

\subheading{BBS System Operators:} Besides being a {\bf Hobbyist} asç
defined above, you may have the software available for download, asç
you would any other program. Please keep READ.MEs and POLICY files,ç
along with the basic files as supplied by me, together as a unit toç
avoid confusion frustration for all of us.

\subheading{Shareware Distributors,} clubs, etc: Please order theç
complete package as a {\bf Commercial User}; for small hobbyist clubs,ç
as a {\bf Hobbyist} or {\bf Individual}. This will assure you theç
latest correct and complete version, and the manual will help yourç
club members get things going easily. Such a deal. Look, I'm notç
getting rich off this (or even breaking even!) so let's scratch eachç
others backs, OK?

Special arrangements can always be made on a case by case basis.  Inç
all cases, bugs are fixed promptly, as they have been for six years.
