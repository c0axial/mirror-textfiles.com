\section{Software Policy}

This is the new (6 July 1989) software policy for the \fido\ç
package. Please read it carefully.

First:

Hobbyists run BBSs for their own personal reasons. Their BBS is ç
not associated with their employer or any business. How they run ç
their BBS is none of my business, ie. private, public, ç
subscription or chattel slavery.

Commercial users are companies, corporations, proprietorships or ç
any other business entities that run a BBS, either publicly orç
privately, associated with their business. ``Non-profit'' andç
``not for profit'' organizations are included in this category.

And here's the deal:

{\bf Hobbyists and Individuals:} \fido\ is shareware; the latest ç
version of the software, minus documentation, can always be found ç
on the Fido Software BBS. There is no downloadable documentation. ç
(If you thought the version 11 docs were unwieldy\dots) You must ç
register the software for \$50; in return you will receive the ç
latest version on diskette plus printed and bound documentation. ç
If you later desire updates via diskette instead of download, ç
updates cost \$25 plus the original Fido Software diskette.

{\bf Commercial Users:} \fido\ is a usual licensable product; theç
license fee is \$175, as it has been for two years. You will ç
receive the latest software version, complete documentation, and ç
support via the Fido Software BBS and voice telephone. (This has ç
proved to be more than adequate for over two years.) Updates can ç
be obtained by downloading, or via diskette for \$25 plus the ç
original Fido Software diskette or proof of purchase.

{\bf BBS System Operators:} Besides being a {\bf Hobbyist} asç
defined above, you may have the software available for download,ç
as you would  any other program. Please keep READ.MEs and POLICYç
files, along with the basic files as supplied by Fido Software,ç
together as a unit to avoid confusion frustration for all of us.

{\bf Shareware Distributors,} clubs, etc: Please order theç
complete package as a {\bf Commercial User}; for small hobbyistç
clubs, as a {\bf Hobbyist} or {\bf Individual}. This will assureç
you the latest correct and complete version, and the manual willç
help your club members get things going easily. Such a deal.ç
Look, I'm not getting rich off this (or even breaking even!) soç
let's scratch each others backs, OK?

Special arrangements can always be made on a case by case basis. ç
In all cases, bugs are fixed promptly, as they have been for five ç
years. This is basically the policy that was in force through ç
1987. It worked pretty well, there were very few problems, and ç
most of those were caused by my ambiguity.
