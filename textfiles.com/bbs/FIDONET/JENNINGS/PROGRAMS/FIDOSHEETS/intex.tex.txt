Thank you for calling me regarding this trademark issue. As youç
can see from the enclosed copies, the word ``Fido'' has beenç
registered to me for some time. It is still very active inç
national commerce.

I am not interested in taking any legal action, my only goal isç
see that my trademarks are protected; it will suffice toç
immediately stop using the mark(s). I would appreciate an exampleç
of your usage of mark currently, for my files, and once it hasç
been removed, a sample copy of the new matter. This correctionç
will completely satisfy my requirements on this issue.

And thanks once again for replying so quickly. I'm sure this canç
be taken care of to our mutual satisfaction.
