Fido/FidoNet is a software package for DOS based Personalç
Computers that contains a complete Bulletin Board System plus aç
fully automatic Electronic Mail system. 

Fido is the most popular Bulletin Board system in the worldç
because of its flexibility, reliability, and features; FidoNet isç
the software that defined the FidoNet protocol now in use aroundç
the world. The worlds largest privately-owned computer network isç
based upon the FidoNet communications protocol.

Fido(r) Bulletin Board System:

	Absolute security
	Complete caller access controls
	200 independent message & file areas
	Complete Email and message commands
	Fully error correcting file transfer protocols
	Supports all major DOS/MSDOS Personal Computers

Callers, commands, message and file areas can all have separateç
privilege levels and Locks & Keys applied to them; these let youç
limit callers' access to any part of the Fido system to fit yourç
needs.

FidoNet(r) Electronic Mail Network:

	Completely automatic Electronic Mail
	Full error correction protocol
	Extensive time-of-day event scheduling
	Powerful message routing language
	Automatic message routing

FidoNet is an automatic "store-and-forward" mail system that usesç
modems to transfer messages and files between 
FidoNet-equipped computers. Using Fido, you enter messages,ç
choosing the destination computer(s) from a list; later, FidoNetç
automatically transfers those messages to the destinationç
computers. Fido/FidoNet will inform you when the message has beenç
successfully sent. There can be any number of messages pending toç
any number of destination computers. FidoNet's routing languageç
and other resources let you control exactly how and when FidoNetç
messages are sent. All transfers use error correction forç
absolute reliability (Fido supports both the original andç
universal FidoNet protocol, as well as the WaZoo protocol,ç
developed by Wynn Wagner).

FidoNet networks can be organized into "Nets" and "Regions"ç
(FidoNet also has "Zones", groups of Nets and Regions, thatç
handle the problems of intercontinental traffic; differences inç
time zones, incompatible modems, outgoing "gateways" for lowestç
cost, and so on), each of which can contain any number ofç
computers running the Fido/FidoNet software, or compatibles,ç
(nodes) one of which is designated Host for the Net. A Hostç
receives mail for the entire Net, and distributes the mail to itsç
local nodes. FidoNet is intelligent enough to send all messagesç
for a given net in one phone call; you can get further efficiencyç
with the routing language. 

FidoNet networks can be as small as two or three computers, or asç
large as 5,000 spread over five continents, the size of theç
amateur hobbyist IFNA Network as of January, 1989.

System Description

Ease of use: Fido/FidoNet is extremely easy to use, and isç
compatible with just about any users terminal program orç
computer. The user interface does not get in the way ofç
communicating; there are only two levels of menus. Users see onlyç
what they need; novices find an easy to understand selection ofç
simple commands, and experts can choose a brief prompt. Contextç
sensitive help is available at all decision points.

Reliability: Fido/FidoNet is designed first and foremost forç
reliability, meaning it will run 24 hours a day for months at aç
time with no human intervention. (Obviously this doesn't includeç
responding to callers questions or other such things.) Tools areç
provided that handle all routine maintenance tasks automatically.

Performance: Fido/FidoNet makes excellent use of ordinaryç
computers; "PC class" computers are all that's needed. ("ATç
class" or better are recommended at 9600 baud and above.)

More than one modem: While Fido/FidoNet supports only one modem,ç
you can run more than one copy of Fido/FidoNet per computer usingç
multitasker programs. Fido/FidoNet prevents file and messageç
"collisions" when there are other users reading and writing theç
same messages and downloading or uploading files, and for someç
multitaskers will give unused CPU time to the other Fido/FidoNet.ç
See "Supported Operating Systems" for the current list ofç
supported multitaskers.

Low disk space overhead: A 20 Megabyte hard disk meansç
essentially unlimited space; room for thousands of messages,ç
files, a 4,000+ node FidoNet network, and plenty of disk spaceç
left over.

For a sample "small scale" system, with only two 360K floppiesç
and 256K of memory, there is room for all of the basicç
Fido/FidoNet system utilities plus your text editor and otherç
tools, over 200 messages, and close to 100K bytes free. The sameç
system with a 1,600 node FidoNet Network can have approximatelyç
80 messages. 

Modem Handling: Fido/FidoNet achieves extremely high reliabilityç
with ordinary modems. During idle periods, Fido/FidoNet "talksç
to" the modem to make sure it is ready and working. (While ofç
course modems are not supposed to misbehave, in real life theyç
can get confused by callers' strange and incompatible modems,ç
improper operation, bad phone lines, and the very cheap modemsç
frequently have firmware bugs. Fido/FidoNet generally takes careç
of all of these things. Almost all problems reported to Fidoç
Software are modem-related problems!) Incoming callers' baud rateç
is determined automatically; callers do not have to hit theç
"ENTER" key to get the systems attention. Outgoing calls made byç
FidoNet (if so enabled) watch for busy, no-dial-tone, and otherç
features as supported by each modem.

Caller DataBase: Each caller to the system has a record in aç
database that maintains each callers name, password, terminal≠
specific settings, privilege levels and controls, and variousç
statistics. Tools provided manipulate these records both manuallyç
and automatically. The number of callers is limited only by diskç
space.

System Messages and Bulletins: Fido/FidoNet uses ordinary textç
files for most system messages and bulletins, that are meant toç
be customized for your installation. When displaying and enteringç
text, the Fido takes into account each callers terminal settings,ç
such as screen width and length, and performs on-screenç
formatting for a clean display.

Access Controls: There are six privilege levels that callers canç
be assigned. You can specify minimum privilege levels needed toç
access commands and message and file areas.

In addition to privilege levels, there are 32 "locks" withç
matching "keys". Locks are be applied to things such as commandsç
and message and file areas; callers may be given any number ofç
keys. Callers can access only those things for which they haveç
all of the matching keys, plus meet the privilege levelç
requirements. For example, if the E)nter-Message command has lockç
#20 applied, only callers that have Key #20, plus any necessaryç
minimum privilege levels, can use, see or get help with thatç
command.

Limits can be placed on each callers' connect-time on the systemç
per-call and per-24-hour period, and on file downloads. Timeç
limits are enforced at all times, including file download andç
upload, so that scheduled Events are not preempted by caller fileç
downloads or uploads. ("Optional" events, described elsewhere,ç
may be preempted by human callers.)

Context-Sensitive Help System: Help is 
context-sensitive, taking into account what commands the callerç
has access to because of privilege levels or locks and keys. Helpç
is available on every command in the system. The Help files areç
text files that can be customized to fit your specific needs.

Message Areas: There can be up to 200 separate message areas,ç
each with access controls as described above. The number ofç
messages in each area is limited only by disk space. Callers canç
enter new messages, modify existing saved messages, search forç
messages by keyword or as addressed to or from them, and performç
many other operations upon messages. Help is available at allç
decision points. 

File Areas: There can be up to 200 independent file areas, withç
access controls as described earlier. There are a number of waysç
in which to make files available (or not) to callers. Commandsç
and functions have been added to make remote maintenance of fileç
areas and other parts of the disk easier for the system operator.ç
Files can be uploaded and downloaded in ASCII, ZMODEM, XMODEM,ç
Telink, "MODEM BATCH" or Kermit protocols. XMODEM is nearlyç
universal, and can handle binary files; ZMODEM has performance toç
match high-performance modems; Kermit and ASCII are used betweenç
otherwise-incompatible computers.

Fido Software's "FidoTerm" program works well with Fido/FidoNetç
(or any other modem based system).

Programmed events: There can be up to 100 "Events", scheduled toç
run at any time of the day and any day of the week. Events allowç
Fido/FidoNet to run FidoNet network mail, execute externalç
programs via DOS Batch Files, and other events for variousç
special purposes. The events system can handle simultaneousç
and/or overlapping events, special "optional" events, andç
combinations of events and special characteristics. ("Optional"ç
events can be used, for example, to simulate "background" FidoNetç
network activity while no caller is otherwise occupying theç
system.)

FidoNet mail at any time: Fido/FidoNet can send or receive mailç
to and from other Fido/FidoNet systems at any time a caller isç
not occupying the system, as well as during scheduled FidoNetç
Network Events. Optionally, Fido/FidoNet can execute externalç
programs via a DOS Batch File to do special processing ofç
unscheduled Incoming Mail.

Other Features & Enhancements: You can sign in to the system fromç
the local keyboard, as if you had called in remotely with aç
modem, without "taking down" the system. Upcoming events can beç
listed, and previously-run events can be reenabled from the localç
keyboard.

Fido works with external "shell" programs to allow programmersç
and "aftermarket" add-on programs to work with Fido/FidoNet.ç
Technical information is available in the manual. (Externalç
"shell" support programs are not supplied by Fido Software.)

Customization

Fido/FidoNet parameters, lists of events, command names, andç
message and file area definitions are contained in ordinary textç
files you can display and change with your own text editorç
program.  Message and file areas are defined in one text file;ç
the Fido/FidoNet system takes care of all the work of creatingç
and verifying the actual DOS subdirectories used. Commands are inç
their own text file, along with any privilege levels and locks.ç
You can change command names to any single word you choose.

Programs Supplied with Fido/FidoNet

The following are some of the programs supplied as part of theç
standard Fido/FidoNet system package. In addition, there are manyç
"aftermarket" programs from other authors that make using andç
maintaining Fido/FidoNet easier and more powerful. 

You can schedule Events in Fido/FidoNet to execute these or otherç
programs at any time, using an MSDOS Batch File you create toç
make your system completely or partially automatic.

MSGMGR.EXE: (the Message Manager) performs routine maintenance onç
messages within Fido/FidoNet Message Areas, such as purgingç
messages by age, and renumbering messages so they are sequential.ç
MSGMGR has it's own text file of commands that tells it what toç
do. 

SYSOP.EXE: is a database-like tool for managing the callerç
database that contains the names, passwords and statistics andç
other information on each caller. You can enter new callers,ç
delete existing callers one by one or by time since last loggedç
in; set caller privilege level and assign Keys; force callersç
into specific message and file areas; and many more functions.ç
There is also an "undo" feature and context sensitive help.

FIDOMAIL.EXE: lets you create FidoNet network messages with yourç
own text editor or word processor. For example, during the dayç
you can create text files destined for other FidoNet networkç
nodes, and via an Event, have AutoMail put them into the FidoNetç
message system.

TWIX.EXE: prints FidoNet network mail newly received on yourç
printer or in a disk file you specify.

Cards); please contact the manufacturers of those products forç
details.

Fido/FidoNet is specifically DoubleDOS and DESQView aware. 


Software Policy

This is the new (June 1989) software policy for the Fido/FidoNetç
package. Please read it carefully. 

First, some definitions:

Hobbyists run BBSs for their own personal reasons. Their BBS isç
not associated with their employer or any business. How they runç
their BBS is none of my business, ie. private, public,ç
subscription or chattel slavery.

Commercial users are companies, corporations, proprietorships orç
any other business entities that run a BBS, either publicly orç
privately, associated with their business. "Non-profit" and "notç
for profit" organizations are included in this category. 

And here's the deal:

Hobbiests and Individuals: Fido/FidoNet is shareware; you canç
download the software itself, minus documentation, from the Fidoç
Software BBS. There is no downloadable documentation. (If youç
thought the version 11 docs were unwieldy...) I will provide noç
direct support. Hobbyists can receive the complete packageç
(diskettes and documentation) for a reduced price, as listed onç
the price sheet.

Commercial Users: Fido/FidoNet is an ordinary licensable product,ç
the license fee is as it has been for two years. You will receiveç
the complete package of diskettes, complete documentation, andç
support via the Fido Software BBS and voice telephone. (This hasç
proved to be more than adequate for over two years.)

It is common practice that commercial users "try out"ç
Fido/FidoNet as "shareware" first. There is nothing wrong withç
this as long as if the software has been or will be useful toç
you, the product is licensed immediately.

Special arrangements can be made on a case by case basis. In allç
cases, bugs are fixed promptly, as they have been for five years.ç
This is basically the policy that was in force 1985 through 1987,ç
and worked very well; people appreciate being trusted, andç
Fido/FidoNet is an extremely high quality system.

"Shareware" Distributors: I do not wish Fido/FidoNet to beç
distributed by "shareware distributors", "libraries" or otherç
similar organizations. The problems are too numerous to count:ç
shipping ancient, incomplete versions; missing critical files;ç
giving out incorrect information regarding support; giving badç
operating advice, etc. Never mind the fact that they are usingç
the software for profit, regardless of claims to the otherwiseç
and suggesting that their customers pay instead.

language with true programming language constructs: a switch()ç
statement, local variables, subroutining and recursion. Comesç
complete with printed manual.

FidoTerm is well integrated into Fido/FidoNet; it may be invokedç
from Fido's local console, and will "know" about the installedç
modem type and port, and recently-added commands let you dialç
from a FidoNet nodelist.
